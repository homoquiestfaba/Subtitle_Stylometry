Thanks, though.

one of those, huh?

50
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,246
- One of those what?

51
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,081

Just, I've never
really understood it.

- Aw, come on.

57
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:50,063
Don't be like that.

58
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,934

it's the moral high ground.

61
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,747
I mean, I don't agree with it.

62
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,149
- Obviously.

63
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,853
- [Sean] But I sorta get it.

64
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:18,025
- All right then, Confucius,
what don't you get about it?

65
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,327
- I don't get all
these scenes anymore.

66
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,164
Wasn't the whole point to
get away from the clubs?

72
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,982
I'm just saying, I
got into this music

73
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,584
because it was fun and chaotic.

74
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,454
You know, bouncing
around, picking up change.

75
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,022
You know what I mean.

76
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,992

like your pals in there

79

- I'm fine, man, I just
needed a little air.

80
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,937
- Sure, man, whatever you say.

81
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,006
- Look, I gotta...

85
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,289
Hey kid.

86
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:24,591
Look at me.

87
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,464
I am not gonna ask again, kid.

88
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,166
Look at me.

89
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,239
(foreboding music)

90
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,374
Why'd you wear that shirt?

91
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,476
- What?

92
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,544
- I know you heard me, kid.

93
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,847
What's with the shirt?

94
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,216
- Tell him you're a patriot.

95
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,585
- Stay the fuck out of this.

96
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,857
- I don't know, my
girlfriend bought it for me.

97
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,995
- I didn't ask who
got it for you, kid.

98
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,498
What I asked was
why you wore it.

99
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,102
- I don't know,
it's just a shirt.

100
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,871
I thought it was cool.

101
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:12,973
- Shit.

102
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:17,210
What a twig. (laughs)

103
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,211
- Know what?

104
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,214
You're right.

105
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,315
It is cool.

106
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:25,786
It's a cool shirt.

107
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,057
So cool, in fact, that
I just have to have it.

108
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,995
- I can ask her
where she got it.

109
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,064
- Jesus, kid.

110
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,968
- I believe that what
my brother's saying

111
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,669
is that I don't
want another shirt.

112
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,538
What I want is that one.

113
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,778
- And what am I
supposed to wear home?

114
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,984
- Well, that's not my
problem, now is it, kid?

115
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,053
- You really should've
thought of that

116
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,155
before you wore that stupid
bullshit shirt in there.

117
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,760
(sighs)

118
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:13,266
- Give me the shirt
or take a beating.

119
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,803
Your choice.

120
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,406
- I can't, I can't
give you the shirt.

121
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,774
My girlfriend will kill me.

122
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,111
- Better her than us.

123
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,782
- Please, just...

124
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,218
- Getting impatient here, kid.

125
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:34,822
- Just...

126
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,497
- Done.

127
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,333
It's done.

128
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,905
- Thank you, Brad.

129
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,807
And thank you, kid!

00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,516
Oh.

132
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,920
Tell your girlfriend I
said thanks for the shirt.

133
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:12,792
- Get up.

134
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,697
Kid, I'm not fucking asking,
get up off the ground.

135
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,203
- Keaton.

136
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,573
- What?
- It's Keaton, not kid.

137
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,442
- Tell someone who gives a shit.

138
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:31,845
- Brad!

139
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,918
Smile, Manners.

140
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,253
- You all right?

141
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,156
- I should've fought back.

142
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,492
- No.

143
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,726
No, you really shouldn't have.

144
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,096
You never get in a
fight you can't win.

145
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,230
How much money you got?

146
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,833
- Are you gonna
take my money too?

147
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,535
- No, just how much
you got on you?

148
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:57,837
- Five bucks.

149
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,945
- Get back in there
and buy a shirt

150
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,446
off the Uglybones merch table.

151
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,985
- Thanks, I guess.

152
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,188
- Whatever, don't
get all sentimental.

153
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,190
You owe me if I see
you at another show.

154
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,760
(horn honks)

155
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,897
- Daddy's calling,
better run home.

156
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,935
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you too.

157
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,344
Looks like you're
buying me a drink.

158
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,880
(solemn music)

159
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,027
- Brad.

160
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,696
Hey, yo, Brad.
(patrons chatter)

161
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,930
Earth to Brad.

162
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,934
- You good?

163
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,870
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm
just a little out of it.

164
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,472
- You think?

165
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,307
- All right.

166
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,809
Benefits show.

167
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,643
Who's doing what?

168
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,179
- Yeah, Tricky's on lineup,

169
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,814
Manners is out
putting up flyers.

170
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,318
- I'm running merch
table, getting a distro.

171
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,620
- Awesome, man.

172
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,389
Anyone coming from Antifa?

173
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,292
- Shit.

174
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,127
I'll get on it.

175
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,894
I keep forgetting.

176
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,297
- You gotta at least reach out,

177
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,532
otherwise we'll never
hear the end of it.

178
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,067
- I know, I know.

179
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,640
- All right, and I'm
bringing the cell jammers

180
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,841
for whenever the cops
break up the show

181
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,676
for a stupid reason
like last time.

182
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:19,812
What's Brad doing?

183
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,086
- I don't know, man, sorta
sounds like it's all covered.

184
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,427
What?

185
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,330
- Kinda seems like the
last couple of things

186
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,699
have been all covered.

187
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,934
- Come on, I promoted
for the show at Tricky's.

188
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,304
- Posting online is
not exactly the type

189
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,305
of help I'm meaning.

190
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,910
- All right, so I'll reach out
to he anti-fascist guys then.

191
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,513
- No, I got it.
- No, don't sweat it.

192
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,681
I gotta go.

193
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,582
- We just started.

194
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,585
- So catch me up later, yeah?

195
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,324
Tricky, Damon.

196
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,626
Boomer, go fuck yourself.

197
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,894
(tense music)

198
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,329
- Fuck you too, man.

199
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,895
(record crackles)

200
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,703
("Nous" by Noose)

201
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,408
(shouting lyrics angrily)

202
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,811
- You like Noose, huh?

203
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,912
- What, no.

204
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,950
Duh.

205
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,052
That's why I have it
over there on my shelf.

206
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,155
- Always with the jokes.

207
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,356
I just meant that
they're a pretty hardcore

208
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,757
straight edge group.

209
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,392
Kinda surprised you dig them.

210
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,793
- You know, hanging out with you

211
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,629
is turning out to
be a real blast.

212
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,464
- Dick.

213
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:22,469
- So I have to be edge
to like good music?

214
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,304
You ever watch porn?

215
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,673
- What?

216
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,342
- Do you ever watch pornography?

217
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,678
- Well yeah, not like
a lot or anything.

218
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,980
- So then are you
into exploiting women?

219
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,485
Or better yet, are you just
into seeing naked dudes?

220
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,620
- What, no, of course not.

221
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,490
- Well, then there you have it.

222
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,824
- There you have what?

223
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,058
- Just because
you like something

224
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,295
doesn't mean you have
to support the message.

225
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,731
Yeah, try keeping up.

226
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,833
One of these days
I'll learn you.

227
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,635
- Would you ever
listen to Flathead?

228
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,903
- Hell no!

229
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,171
- Cause they're Nazis?

230
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,540
- No, because their
music fucking blows.

231
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,010
Granted, it helps other Nazis,

232
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,346
and I'm not gonna
support that shit.

233
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,482
But if their music
was good enough,

234
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,683
I'd still probably listen.

235
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:11,951
- You would?

236
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,854
- Yeah, I mean I am
a big fan of lyrics,

237
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,657
so if their shit
was all hate speech,

238
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,427
then I probably wouldn't
be that interested.

239
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,230
But you know, good
tunes is good tunes.

240
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,765
You think you agree
with everything

241
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,834
every band ever says or does?

242
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,668
I doubt it.

243
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,639
- Aw, you may be
right about that,

244
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,007
but I still wouldn't
support groups like that.

245
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,610
- So then what about Uglybones?

246
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,779
- I don't follow.

247
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,581
- They're notorious partiers.

248
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,251
All their shit is about
getting fucked up.

249
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,253
- Yeah, I can't support that.

250
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,320
- Yeah, I know.

251
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,589
So...

252
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,123
- So what?

253
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,826
- So then why did you
even go to the show?

254
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,528
- Oh, that's was James' idea.

255
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,697
- Yeah, why am I not surprised?

256
00:19:59,065 --> 00:19:59,899
- What?

257
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,968
What, you know James?

258
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,304
- I know of him.

259
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,173
And I know his type.

260
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,718
(eerie music)

261
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,053
- You know, never
understood the whole

262
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,355
family picks you up thing.

263
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,325
- Well, it's not like you
had the support system

264
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,527
to even grant you the option.

265
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,361
- Still.

266
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,631
I fucking hate
these college kids.

267
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,634
I mean, each year, more and
more move out of the dorms

268
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,269
and into the neighborhood.

269
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,337
- It's a free country.

270
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,039
- Yeah?

271
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:40,840
Bullshit.

272
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,676
Hey, hipsters!

273
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,078
How's about you
stay gone this time?

274
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,846
- Spring break!

275
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,817
(James chuckles)

276
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,421
- What's that all about?

277
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,892
All right, let's have it.

278
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,096
What's been going
on with you lately?

279
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,832
- [Brad] What do you mean?

280
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:06,666
- Come on.

281
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,902
Can't bullshit a
bullshitter, Bradley boy.

282
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,172
- Don't call me that.

283
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,708
- So sorry, sensitive guy.

284
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,810
- I hate when you call
me that, all right?

285
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,847
- Well, out with it.

286
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:25,952
(sighs)

287
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,753
- I don't know, man,
I've just been getting

288
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:27,620
sorta bored lately.

289
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,157
- Okay, well let's do
something about that.

290
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,693
We can go see a
show up in the city

291
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,995
or go mess up some
yuppies downtown.

292
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,230
- That's just it, though.

293
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,967
Been getting bored of that.

294
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,270
- With what, the shows?

295
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,773
- No, man, the music,
the fights, the politics.

296
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,676
- What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

297
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,744
(tense music)

298
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,880
- Just feels like
it's all sorta...

299
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,482
- Sorta what?

300
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,549
- Sorta pointless.

301
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,323
- What?

302
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,459
- I just feel like we
aren't doing anything

303
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,528
to help out anymore, you know?

304
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,262
- We got the fucking
Nazis out of our shows.

305
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,864
Don't you fucking tell
me we've done nothing.

306
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,099
- That's not what I meant.

307
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,967
- What the fuck do
you mean then, Brad?

308
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:16,969
- Chill out, bro.

309
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:18,838
- Bro?

310
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,174
Don't you fucking tell
me to chill out, Brad.

311
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,977
- Know what, don't go fucking
barking orders at me, James.

312
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,245
I'm not one of your
goddamn cronies

313
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,747
you can just boss
around, all right?

314
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,315
- Yeah, you're not, which
is why I wouldn't expect you

315
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,917
to be the one to start
acting like such a pussy

316
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:31,718
all of a sudden.

317
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,086
- Go fuck yourself.

318
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,788
- [James] Don't you
fucking walk away.

319
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:36,689
- The hell off me.

320
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,160
- Shit.

321
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,763
I'm sorry, man.

322
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,532
I lost my temper.

323
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,233
- [Brad] Get the
fuck off my porch.

324
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,471
- Come on, man.

325
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:56,443
Brad.
(door closes)

326
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,487
- Never.

327
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,522
He's never put his
fucking mitts on me, man.

328
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,358
- You need a drink.

329
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,596
- Hardy har, funny guy.

330
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,330
- No, I'm serious.

331
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,666
You need to relax.

332
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,902
- I don't believe in that.

333
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,538
- Believe in what, relaxing?

334
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,574
You know, I'd
almost believe that.

335
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,643
- I don't need to
drink to relax.

336
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,112
- Right, I can see that.

337
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,017
- Smug fucking asshole,

338
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:40,620
I should've done
something, said something.

339
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,789
I should've hit him back.
- Hey, got you a drink.

340
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,762
You know, didn't you
tell that kid at the club

341
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,798
he shouldn't pick a
fight he can't win?

342
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:52,932
- So?

343
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,634
- Well, come on.

344
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,271
- You don't think
I could take James?

345
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,608
- (chuckles) No.

346
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,441
- Bullshit.

347
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,443
You're an asshole.

348
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,253
Think your OJ's
past its due date.

349
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,755
- Um, no.

350
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,058
No, that wasn't it.

351
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,798
- Sean, what the hell?

352
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,166
- Dude, I'm sorry.

353
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,835
You scooped it up
so fucking fast

354
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,637
I didn't even have
time to stop you.

355
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,406
- Think I'm gonna be sick.

356
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,544
- You know, you did
just have a drink.

357
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,045
Why not have a few more?

358
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,814
- No, no, Sean, there is no
way I'm taking another drink.

(chuckles)

406
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,801
- Maybe you should
slow down a little.

407
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,606
(coughs)
(groans)

408
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,242
Damn it!

(chuckles)

410
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:58,878
Really?

411
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,552
- Yeah, that happened.

412
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,699
- Wasn't at the Capitalist
show last weekend.

413
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,974
- Yeah, he didn't show for
Damon's party last week either.

414
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:28,808
- Yeah, I know.

415
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,445
He hasn't been
answering texts, calls.

416
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,782
(sensual jazz music)

417
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,716
- Well, my sister
heard he's gonna be

418
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,151
at the party on Tinkler.

419
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,687
- What, at the house?

420
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,090
Go ask your sister.

421
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,545
- You really think?

422
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,116
- Anybody else we
know on Tinkler?

423
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,728
(heavy metal music)

424
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,136

00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,243
(hardcore punk music)

426
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,389
- Well, look who
decided to show up.

427
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,827
Here you go, try this.

428
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,595
It's called beer.

429
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:57,629
It's amazing.

430
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,166
Oh, come on.

431
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,702
Just one fucking sip to find
out it's not gonna kill you.

432
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,973
I promise that you
won't get molested.

433
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,743
- You're such an idiot.

434
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,245
- Yeah, sometimes.

435
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:16,548
Yeah!

436
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,452
(coughs)

437
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,788
- This go bad, or this just
how bad it always tastes?

438
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,791
- Yeah, sometimes, but, you
know, you'll get used to it.

439
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,259
- It tastes disgusting.

440
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,260
- Very good.

441
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,628
(partygoers chatter)

442
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,631
(garage punk music)

443
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,992
(shouts lyrics angrily)

444
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,881
Maybe.

445
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,483
- Maybe what?

446
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,485
- Maybe, that's her name.

447
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,458
This is her house.

448
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,461
- Oh.

449
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,362
Well, thanks.

450
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,077
(toilet flushes)

451
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,520
- (gasps) Fuck.

452
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,764
All right.

453
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,834
Step two.

454
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,140
(screams aggressively)

455
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,417
- Thank you!

456
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,063
- Maybe.

457
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,697
- Yeah.

458
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,267
- No, my name, it's Maybe.

459
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,035
- No, I meant
like, yeah, I know.

460
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,503
- Oh, do you now?

461
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,175
Well then it would seem you
have me at a disadvantage.

462
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,509
- Yeah, I guess.

463
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:34,046
I'm sorry.
(laughs)

464
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,448
I am Brad.

465
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,716
- Brad?

466
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,718
- Yeah, it was my dad's name.

467
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,788
- Nah, sounds like
a fat girl's name.

468
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:43,622
- What?

469
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,557
- Claire.

470
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,360
- Shit, yeah, got it.

471
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,361
- Thank you.

472
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,135
- You, you want a drink?

473
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:58,537
- Yes.

474
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,177
(guitar strums)

475
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,391
(knocking)

476
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,538
(groans)

477
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,140
- It's so warm.

478
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,387
(insistent knocking)

479
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,592
(hardcore punk music)

480
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,867
- So I gotta know.

481
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:06,071
What made you break edge?

482
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,273
- Oh.

483
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,674
Are we gonna get
into this right now?

484
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,108
- We don't have to.

485
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,480
It was Sean, right?

486
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,615
You're gay for Sean?

487
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:18,384
- God damn it.

488
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:20,486
(laughs)

489
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,290
- But seriously, I wanna know.

490
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:27,926
- All right.

491
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:30,596
I did it because
I'm gay for Sean.

492
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,198
- (laughs) You shit.

493
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:36,735
- No, I just, it just
got old, I guess.

494
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,204
- Got old?

495
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,273
- No, I mean, it
turned into something

496
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,908
I didn't really want it to be.

497
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,545
- Isn't the whole point
to be uncompromising

498
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,480
and hold to the
rules of the club?

499
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,551
- It's not a club.

500
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,052
- It's a bunch of guys, right?

501
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,154
- Yeah.

502
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,824
- Do you own anything
that matches?

503
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,759
- Well, yeah, but...
- Then it's a club.

504
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:06,665
So what changed
about the not-club?

505
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,169
- When James and I started in

506
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,738
on this whole straight-edge
thing, it was just as a means

507
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,806
to get rid of all the
bad shit at shows.

508
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,076
Skinheads, drug dealers.

509
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,578
- Skins?

510
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,280
- Yeah, red laces, not SHARPs.

511
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,185
A bunch of the guys that
were coming to our shows

512
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,087
were affiliated in
one way or another.

513
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:30,889
- Okay.

514
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,260
Still doesn't explain much.

515
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,094
- All right, sorry.

516
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:38,497
Well, when we started,
it was just about

517
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,198
making sure kids
had a safe space.

518
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,335
No fascists, no drugs,

519
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,604
and it wasn't an STD fest
like with the hippies.

520
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,839
- Oh, yeah, gross, hippies.

521
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,011
- Yeah, but as time went on,

522
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,146
James got more
and more militant.

523
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,382
The list of rules grew.

524
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:59,217
He cut ties with a lot
of our friends who,

525
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,387
who he thought weren't
true believers.

526
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,254
- True believers?

527
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,224
- Yeah, like edge
till death types.

528
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,058
- Gotcha.

529
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,897
- Now it just feels like an
exclusive club for bullies.

530
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,032
Shows are just as
unsafe and violent

531
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,034
for the younger kids
growing up in the scene.

532
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,136
- Oh, I hate that word.

533
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,240
- Yeah, me too, actually.

534
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,413
Just get this feeling like
I've wasted a lot of my life

535
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,715
worrying about what
other people are doing

536
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:32,150
rather than doing what
I wanna do, you know?

537
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,921
- That sucks.

538
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,456
- Yeah.

539
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,290
Sucks.

540
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:47,733
- But now, you're doing what
you really wanna do now, right?

541
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,703
- Yeah, kinda.

542
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,806
- What do you mean, kinda?

543
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,810
- Oh, nevermind, it's dumb, I...

544
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,515
- [Sean] Gay!

545
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,684
(giggles)

546
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,690
- You, you want another drink?

547
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,625
- Yes, please.

548
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,568
How you feeling?

549
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,670
- Feel like there's a
mosh pit in my stomach.

550
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,138
(laughs)

551
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,041
(foreboding music)

552
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,310
(chatting)

553
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,663
(guitar strums)

554
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,640
(mumbles)

555
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,742
(whoops)

556
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,911
- This is not my microphone.

557
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,033
(man shouts)

558
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,606
Here we fucking go!

559
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:39,177
(grungy punk music)

560
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,504
Trail of Death.

561
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:08,574
(audience cheers)

562
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:11,743
(hardcore punk music)

563
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,457
(screams lyrics aggressively)

564
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,229
- Come on, bitch, you've
been in here forever.

565
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,798
- Fucking fall in?

566
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:33,632
- Come on.

567
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,237
- [Young Woman] Come on,
lady, you fucking fall in?

568
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,906
Get out!

569
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,273
God, come on.

570
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,654
(screams lyrics aggressively)

571
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,098
(grungy punk music)

572
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,508
(hardcore punk music)

573
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:20,512
(screaming lyrics aggressively)

574
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,735
(ominous music)

575
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,492
(alternative rock music)

576
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,161
- Did you hear that?

577
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:20,666
- No.

578
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:24,836
Keep going?

579
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,272
- Sure.

580
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,581
- [Singer] What just happened?

581
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,017
- [Man] I think
we're under attack.

582
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:40,251
- Under attack?

583
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:44,923
(suspenseful music)

584
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,825
- [Man] Get away
from the window!

585
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,159
- What the fuck?

586
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,637
- [Man] We're all gonna die!

587
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,207
(crowd clamors)

588
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,910
- [Damon] What the fuck?

589
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,912
- [James] Get in there.

590
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:07,746
Now.

591
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,087
(crowd clamors)

592
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:19,958
- Please.

593
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,045
Did somebody call the cops?

594
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,947
- We tried already,
nobody has signal.

595
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:43,749
- Shit.

596
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,252
(tense music)

597
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,931
They're using a jammer.

598
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:01,499
- [Woman] A what?

599
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,234
- They're blocking our service.

600
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,169
- We should fight back.

601
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:05,336
There's more of us than them.

602
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,637
- Just let me
think for a second.

603
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:25,123
- [Damon] What was that, man?

604
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,125
This isn't what we agreed to.

605
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,194
- [James] This isn't
a fucking democracy.

606
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,161
You were here, too.

607
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,065
So it's either you or it's them.

608
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,434
Weigh it.

609
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,742
- [Damon] What the shit is that?

610
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:57,355
(eerie music)

611
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,734
- James.

612
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,005
(crowd murmurs)

613
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,506
- We need to go for help!

614
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:17,843
- [Man] We should lock
ourselves in the basement.

615
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,277
- We'll be trapped down there,

616
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,678
you fucking idiot!
(crowd clamors)

617
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,313
- All right, nobody panic.

618
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:23,448
We need to stay calm and stay...

619
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,150
(crowd screams)

620
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,651
Wait, stay in the house!

621
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:29,154
(tense music)

622
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:41,799
(man cries)

623
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,735
- Oh my gosh, no!
(shouts in pain)

624
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,604
(suspenseful music)

625
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:47,939
- [Man] Come on!

626
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:50,842
Come on!

627
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:53,044
(wails)

628
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,579
- Fuck!

629
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,647
(grunts)

630
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,051
Help!

631
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,768
- [Boomer] Well go get her.

632
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,709
(unsettling music)

633
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,361
(suspenseful music)

634
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,064
- Need a push, man!

635
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,569
What, what the hell!

636
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,040
(screams)

637
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,181
What do you mean, man?

638
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:07,552
(screams)

639
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,488
(unsettling music)

640
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,080
- Wait.

641
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,913
Help!

642
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,587
(girl coughs)

643
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,992
- [Girl] Can somebody
please hold back my hair?

644
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,365
(tense music)

645
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,867
(woman moans)

646
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,772
- Yo, what the fuck?

647
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,742
- [Maybe] You're
in my fucking room!

648
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,413
(screams)

649
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,489
- [Man] Please, no.

650
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:21,192
Help, please.

651
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,330
Let go!

652
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,164
No.

653
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:28,699
Oh no!

654
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:30,468
No, please.

655
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,971
Please, I'm your friend!

656
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,645
- (screams) Brad!

657
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,314
Let me go, let me go!

658
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,816
(man gurgles)

659
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,328
No, stop, stop!

660
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,729
Get the fuck off me!

661
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,366
Stop, stop it!

662
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,200
God!

663
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:13,578
Stop, get the fuck off me!

664
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:14,412
God!

665
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,148
Brad!

666
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,622
- You all right?

667
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,857
- Yeah, I think so.

668
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:28,759
- What do we do with him?

669
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:31,329
- Fuck it.

670
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,270
Say goodnight, asshole.

671
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:45,143
(foreboding music)

672
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:07,798
- [Tricky] Shit.

673
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,650
Sort of poetic, isn't it?

674
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,621
Well, time to pop your cherry.

675
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,958
- [Damon] I don't
think I could do it.

676
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,426
- [Tricky] You
don't have a choice.

677
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,999
You know James,
just get it done.

678
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:52,042
Bully for you, keep moving.

679
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:06,291
(woman screams)

680
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:19,770
- Let's go.

681
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:37,388
Are you fucking kidding me?

682
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,756
- Just go, we gotta get in.

683
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:42,727
(tense music)

684
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:43,828
- [Man] Okay.

685
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,264
All right.

686
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:52,036
Okay.
(man screams)

687
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,739
Okay, you got
this, you got this.

688
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,281
Oh shit.

689
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,788
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

690
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,892
Okay, I gotta get something.

691
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,329
(murmurs)

692
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:23,033
Okay, that'll work.

693
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,703
One thing.

694
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:27,872
This, okay.

695
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,432
(man screams)
- We gotta go.

696
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:55,666
We gotta get out of here.

697
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:59,069
- It's gonna be all
right, I promise.

698
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,106
Here, here, take this.

699
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:17,187
(suspenseful music)

700
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:22,192
(knocking)
- We're gonna die!

701
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:24,862
We're gonna die.

702
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:28,299
We're gonna die, we're
gonna die in here.

703
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:29,634
We're gonna die.

704
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:35,906
We're gonna die.

705
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,451
(knocking stops)

706
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,488
(door rattles)

707
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,667
(tense music)

708
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,302
It's not ours.

709
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:07,705
- [Man] Swear.

710
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:14,979
(man screams)

711
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:15,813
- What the hell are
we doing in here?

712
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,281
This is the bathroom.

713
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:19,784
- Just wanna duck
out for a second.

714
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:22,286
(tense music)

715
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,354
- What are you doing?

716
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,155
- Look.

717
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,868
- Oh my god, Charlie.

718
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,931
- You stabbed me.

719
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,033
(groans)

720
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,506
(foreboding music)

721
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:28,719
Weed.

722
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,591
(door closes)

723
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:45,002
(woman screams)

724
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:26,544
- Yeah, I wanna report a loud
house party on Tinkler Street.

725
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,482
Uh-huh, between Main and Ferry.

726
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:34,451
Huh?

727
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,754
Nah, I'd rather
remain anonymous.

728
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,769
(snores)

729
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:11,556
(tense music)

730
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:14,725
- Manners, get out!

731
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:18,495
Get the fuck down now!

732
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:20,998
- [Tricky] Jimmy, what the fuck?

733
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,199
- I got it.

734
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,868
- The cops are here...
- I said I got it.

735
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:26,203
- [Brad] What was that?

736
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,205
- [Maybe] Cops are here.

737
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:34,478
- Stay out of sight, stay quiet.

738
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,181
Everything will be fine.

739
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:49,927
Hi there.

740
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:52,830
- Hey, what's going on tonight?

741
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,932
- Just a house party, Officer.

742
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:55,766
- House party?

743
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:58,769
Seems pretty dead.

744
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:01,672
- Yeah.

745
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:04,809
Everybody's pretty much
cleared out at this point.

746
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:08,713
- [Tricky] Manners.

747
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:11,749
Manners!

748
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,518
Manners, get the fuck over here.

749
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:21,626
Look.

750
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:44,481
(officers chat)

751
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:54,358
- Well, we had a noise complaint

752
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:57,027
from some concerned
neighbors up the street.

753
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:57,862
- Really?

754
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:00,931
Well, we're all done tonight.

755
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:03,968
Bands took off and everything.

756
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,640
- And they left all
their equipment?

757
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:11,709
- It's a house kit.

758
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,744
Bands play here all the time.

759
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:14,645
- I see.

760
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:18,015
(train horn blares)

761
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:19,183
- Look, guys, I hate to do this,

762
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:20,350
but I think we're
gonna have to go inside

763
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,787
and take a look around,
just to be safe.

764
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:25,990
- What the fuck are they doing?

765
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,825
Why aren't they coming in?

766
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,326
- James could talk his
way out of anything,

767
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:32,362
but there's no way they
won't check out the house.

768
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,197
There's no way.

769
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,769
- Respectfully, I've gotta
ask you not to do that.

770
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:40,104
- Excuse me?

771
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:41,605
And why would you do that?

772
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,009
- Look, just between us.

773
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:49,680
There are still a couple of
underage kids inside hiding out.

774
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,883
- Ah, yeah, I see.

775
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:58,422
- You guys know how it
was when you were younger.

776
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:02,192
- [Female Officer]
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

777
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,528
- We honestly don't want
any problems, Officer.

778
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:06,897
- All right, guy, I
don't want to have

779
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,598
to come out here
again tonight, okay?

780
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:09,499
- No problem, sir.

781
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,669
- Why are they leaving?

782
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,873
- Calm down.
- What do you mean, calm down?

783
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,141
We have to stop them.

784
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:19,409
- We can't, there's
still more of them.

785
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,510
- [Female Officer] If
those kids all stay,

786
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,445
put them to bed, will you?

787
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:23,080
- [James] Yes ma'am, no problem.

788
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:26,183
- Can't let him
know where we are.

789
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,318
- No, we have to let them know.

790
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,588
- Stop, they'll kill us
before the cops get up here.

791
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:32,689
Stop.
- Stop!

792
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,526
- (screams) Help us, help us!

793
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,663
- Hey, stop!

794
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,306
- Oh god.

795
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:54,244
- Fuck.

796
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:15,966
- Damon.

797
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,769
Go get that bitch.

798
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,595
No.

799
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:48,632
No guns.

800
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,300
We'll just attract
more attention.

801
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:54,104
Where the fuck is Tricky?

802
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:56,907
- I don't know, I
think he took off.

803
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:01,145
- All right.

804
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,216
Get in there, let's
button this shit up.

805
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,886
(ominous music)

806
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,471
(gasps)

807
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:34,678
(suspenseful music)

808
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:09,813
(grunts)

809
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:40,744
- Oh god.

810
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,614
Oh god.

811
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:06,636
- I am so fucking
tired right now.

812
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,238
- Me too, but we gotta
stay on our toes, right?

813
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,073
- Right.

814
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,308
Jesus, man, are these
the type of people

815
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:12,809
you used to hang out with?

816
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,744
Cause I thought you said
they just beat people up.

817
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,447
- Yeah, well I guess
they changed the rules.

818
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,684
- [James] Oh, Bradley!

819
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,786
I'm home!

820
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,724
- I have to fight him.

821
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:30,394
- [James] Bradley!

822
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:33,263
- If you go down there,
they'll kill you.

823
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,032
- They're here killing all
these people because of me,

824
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:37,401
I can't just sit
up here and hide.

825
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:38,568
I always hide from him.

826
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:41,871
Everyone here's too drunk
to even defend themselves.

827
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,541
- Brad, you are drunk.

828
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,211
(tense music)

829
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:49,113
- Hey, what about the roof?

830
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:50,380
- Yeah, yeah,
that's a great idea.

831
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,049
We can go up and
hide on the roof.

832
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,517
- No, that's a terrible idea.

833
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,485
I mean we could climb
down from the porch roof.

834
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,488
- Right, right,
that makes sense.

835
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:01,658
I'm sorry, I'm still
sorta high right now.

836
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:04,528
- All right, come on.

837
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,603
(tense music)

838
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,942
Just go.
- Brad.

839
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,130
Oh, no, no!

840
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,398
(cries)

841
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:42,966
No, no!

842
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:44,468
(suspenseful music)

843
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:48,838
Fuck! (screams)

844
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:56,380
Get off me!

845
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,726
Stop!

846
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,728
(yelps)

847
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,699
(screams)

848
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:23,407
(grunts)

849
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,565
(grunts)

850
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,577
(hisses)

851
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,753
- We aren't finished yet.

852
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:25,602
- What was the point
of all this, James?

853
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,272
- You don't know?

854
01:08:29,139 --> 01:08:30,374
I guess you never got it.

855
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,721
(grunts)

856
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,266
You know what the
point was, Brad?

857
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:02,739
The point, Bradley boy,

858
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,744
is that you're not fucking

859
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:09,979
better than me.

860
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,387
(Brad coughs)

861
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:18,222
- James, no.

862
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,125
(gun fires)

863
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:25,262
(acute ringing)
(groans)

864
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:29,566
- That was so loud!

865
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:33,102
See, I told you.

866
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:37,374
- Told me what?

867
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:40,644
- I told you you
couldn't take him.

868
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:48,285
- Shit.

869
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:55,759
(eerie music)

870
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,255
(gasps)
Shit!

871
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,491
- What the fuck?

872
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:09,192
- You what the fuck?

873
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,127
- You're the reason I
fell off that damn roof.

874
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:12,829
- I am not!

875
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,799
- To be fair, he
probably saved your life.

876
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:21,471
- Hey.

877
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,975
(uplifting music)

878
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:28,011
Kinda hard to argue
with that, I guess.

879
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,450
(groans)

880
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,184
Well, is somebody
gonna help me up?

881
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,388
(chuckles)

882
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:49,633
I am never drinking again.

883
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:50,934
- [Sean] Aw, come on.

884
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,336
That's what they all say.

885
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:55,805
Just give it a few hours.

886
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:58,274
- [Brad] We should probably
call somebody, right?

887
01:12:58,274 --> 01:12:59,843
- [Sean] What?

888
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:03,146
Cause that worked out
so well the last time.

889
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,882
- [Brad] Look, I'm just saying
we call committed murders.

890
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,753
- [Maybe] Well, I mean,
technically self defense.

891
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:11,921
- [Sean] I was saving
somebody's life.

892
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,089
Think I was fine.

893
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,290
- [Brad] You shot James
in the head, Sean.

894
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,892
- [Sean] Well, yeah,
some people deserve it.

895
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,160
- [Maybe] Yeah, I was gonna say,

896
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,729
some people are just
asking to get shot.

897
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:20,997
- [Sean] Yeah, I know.

898
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:22,966
Have you ever met
a Swedish person?

899
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:24,400
They suck.
- Yeah, yeah,

900

over and punched him
