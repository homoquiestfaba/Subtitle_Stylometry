00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>Kal-El...</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,620
<i>...my future grandson.</i>

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,007
<i>By the time you hear these words...</i>

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:12,401
<i>...your birth world will be a distant memory.</i>

5
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:18,223
<i>The house of El</i>

6
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,402
<i>led a revolution against tyranny.</i>

7
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:28,059
<i>The story of your family
isn't how we died...</i>

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,857
<i>...but how we lived.</i>

9
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:38,024
<i>I know you will fight
to save your world</i>

10
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,155
<i>just as I fought to save mine.</i>

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,986
Find the Fortress.

12
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:55,244
Your name is El,
never forget it.

13
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:15,096
The blood of House El
will always bind us together.
