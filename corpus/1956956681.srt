WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE ON A SATURDAY?

1387
01:20:47,151 --> 01:20:50,550
YOUR HUSBAND TOLD ME
YOU WERE HERE.

1388
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:53,617
I CAME TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY
I AM I COULDN'T HELP YOU.

1389
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:57,752
NO, JENNA, DON'T FEEL BAD.
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

1390
01:20:57,788 --> 01:20:59,787
BUT YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD TEACHER.

1391
01:20:59,823 --> 01:21:01,387
WHEN I HEARD THAT THEY
WON'T LET YOU TEACH ANYMORE,

1392
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,221
I FELT SICK.

1393
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:06,054
THANK YOU.

1394
01:21:07,789 --> 01:21:11,089
YOU KNOW, I HAD A CHEMISTRY
TEACHER IN HIGH SCHOOL

1395
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:13,090
WHO COMPLETELY INSPIRED ME.

1396
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:18,425
HE GAVE ME THIS PERIODIC TABLE.

1397
01:21:19,227 --> 01:21:21,625
TAKE IT TO DARTMOUTH.

1398
01:21:22,928 --> 01:21:24,760
I DON'T DESERVE THAT.

1399
01:21:24,829 --> 01:21:26,461
YES, YOU DO.

1400
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,927
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

1401
01:21:33,564 --> 01:21:35,296
THANKS, MS. DAWSON.

1402
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:36,930
YEAH...

1403
01:21:41,499 --> 01:21:43,898
I'M READY NOW.

1404
01:21:44,834 --> 01:21:46,731
I WANT TO TESTIFY.

1405
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,299
NO, JENNA, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

1406
01:21:49,402 --> 01:21:50,967
I'M FINE WITH MY DECISION.

1407
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:53,634
REALLY, I'M READY NOW.

1408
01:21:53,703 --> 01:21:55,835
I CAN DO IT.
I WANT TO DO IT.

1409
01:21:55,903 --> 01:21:57,535
DON'T.

1410
01:21:57,603 --> 01:21:59,869
DON'T THROW AWAY DARTMOUTH.

1411
01:22:01,538 --> 01:22:03,336
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1412
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:08,605
I KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE
THAT SCHOOL IS.

1413
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:16,440
AM I RIGHT THAT THE GAINES
WERE GONNA PAY FOR IT?

1414
01:22:16,476 --> 01:22:19,640
I SAW IN YOUR RECORD THAT YOU
DIDN'T HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP.

1415
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,978
IT WAS WRONG.

1416
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:35,879
I KNOW IT.

1417
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:42,448
MY MOM DIDN'T WANT TO
PUT ME THROUGH A TRIAL.

1418
01:22:42,484 --> 01:22:44,881
SHE SAID I WAS TOO SICK.

1419
01:22:46,084 --> 01:22:49,349
BUT SHE WANTED THEM
TO PAY SOMEHOW.

1420
01:22:50,351 --> 01:22:52,083
OH, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

1421
01:22:52,152 --> 01:22:54,450
NO, NO,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

1422
01:22:54,519 --> 01:22:56,017
DON'T EVER SAY THAT.

1423
01:22:56,085 --> 01:22:58,718
YOU DIDN'T INVITE
JOSH TO RAPE YOU.

1424
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:01,686
NO, BUT I DIDN'T
STAND UP TO HIM EITHER,

1425
01:23:01,788 --> 01:23:04,421
NOT FOR YOU OR FOR ME.

1426
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:08,054
BUT I CAN NOW.
PLEASE DON'T STOP ME.

1427
01:23:09,456 --> 01:23:11,489
WHEN YOU ASKED
ME TO TESTIFY,

1428
01:23:11,556 --> 01:23:15,255
YOU SAID THAT TOGETHER
WE COULD BEAT JOSH.

1429
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:17,457
DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT
ANYMORE?

1430
01:23:25,928 --> 01:23:28,626
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
READY FOR ALL THIS?

1431
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:30,926
POSITIVE.

1432
01:23:40,998 --> 01:23:44,297
YOU'RE GONNA BE A GREAT MOM.

1433
01:23:49,867 --> 01:23:51,533
