While Lucia bringing back his wife from hell coming in the world

He says to her whatever happens 
Don't turn round 

3 
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,959 
But he remain hearing the calling to her finally 
Go back over the head 

4 
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,959 
He lost her just so.

As 1983 Argentina's military dictatorship falls from power

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000 
Someone says to us that we must not see backward

Movie : Imagining Argentina 

8 
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000 
Yes, there was not justice in the past 
Often make mistakes 

9 
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000 
But if we see backward 
Grief that will not think either

The wound will not recover again 

12 
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,959 
The officers have already changed the means of the words 
" missing " 

13 
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,959 
To them, the things are missing 
People are missing too 

14 
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,959 
But they are talking about making people missing 
Make their enemy missing 

15 
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000 
The speech has changed 

16 
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,959 
What they wanted to do is to enable disappearing in the past now 

17 
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000 
Say to us that we must not see later 

18 
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,959 
But it is necessary to see later 
We have sacred obligations to see backward

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,959 
I am sorry. Sorry, start once again 

21 
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000 
Good-bye 

22 
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000 
Good-bye, Carlos. What time we is one tomorrow?

Cecilia 

26 
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,959 
What's happened? 

27 
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000 
Where is mother? 

28 
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000 
Do you say that you has received the telephone to threaten? 

29 
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000 
Yes, two 

30 
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000 
What omens are there? 

31 
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000 
No 

32 
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000 
That is that herself has left probably. 
Do you have and quarrel recently? 

33 
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000 
I have already told you 
Pedro has seen three men taking her away 

34 
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000 
Yes, a green car 

35 
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000 
Are there license plates? 

36 
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000 
There are not all kinds of number plates? 

37 
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000 
Are you sure? 

38 
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000 
Yes. I think 

39 
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,959 
Do you think like this? 

40 
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,959 
I hope you don't believe about 
The missinger's rumour 

41 
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,959 
This article was written by my wife 
It is about the missinger 

42 
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000 
What do you want to prove? 

43 
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000 
You write too at ordinary times , is it? 

44 
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000 
Yes. I am a writer 

45 
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000 
Don't worry, we will find your wife 

46 
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,959 
Yes. She loves you 

47 
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000 
You are too bold. You should not to do it? 

48 
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000 
Have you feared? 

49 
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000 
I just talk about the question. Why did you do so? 

50 
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000 
Because our government has do so so. 

51 
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000 
But what do you want to say? 

52 
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000 
Wait a moment. First,someone was missing 

53 
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000 
Then they say "oh, my God 
Too terrible we want to try one's best. " 

54 
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000 
However, it is exactly the order under them 

55 
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000 
Politics is like this. No one would like to set foot in 

56 
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,959 
There are no people. I agree that you talked in the article 

57 
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000 
But I do not think you should issue 

58 
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000 
Carlos, why not? 

59 
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000 
This is a challenge 

60 
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,959 
Carlos, it is some schools that protest 
Raise the price of the bus 

61 
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000 
Then someone is missing without reason 

62 
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000 
Can this rescue them back? 

63 
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000 
It is not this question 

64 
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000 
What is that question? 

65 
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000 
But if someone to denounce 

66 
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000 
What I only wanted to say is 

67 
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,959 
There is one band in the red house nearby 
The paranoiac thought that had made good 

68 
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000 
Have participated in the international communist conspiracy 

69 
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000 
Cecilia, your intention that you thought 
Is it reason ? 

70 
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,959 
No. Suffer the dead end from one's own actions 

71 
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000 
Hey, Lucia 

72 
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000 
Hey, Silvio 

73 
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000 
How are you 

74 
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000 
How do you do, fine? 

75 
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000 
It seems that that someones to parade in the square 

76 
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000 
Who? 

77 
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000 
Some women who is taking the scarf 

78 
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000 
How is your film? 

79 
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000 
Hey, not that's settled 

80 
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000 
I think that I want to see 

81 
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000 
I go with you 

82 
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000 
Do you think together? 

83 
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000 
Not 

84 
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000 
Meet again 

85 
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000 
I will come back in ten minutes 

86 
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,959 
Careful of dog's dung 

87 
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000 
These pitiful persons 

88 
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000 
Who are they? 

89 
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,959 
The missing's mother 

90 
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000 
If mother on the square is futile 

91 
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000 
Do not you think that I should expose the truth ? 

92 
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000 
Situations are different 

93 
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000 
Why? What do you want to say? 

94 
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000 
To them, the tragedy has already taken place 

95 
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000 
It is not a challenge. Is not it such? 

96 
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000 
You are wrong. Someone should be responsible for their disappearance 

97 
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000 
Don't mention. You know ¡­

98 
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000 
But. One exactly seems here ¡­

99 
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000 
Can you talk about some other things? 

100 
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000 
Listening . Age that it is similar to Teresa that it is one group 
Student protest bus price 

101 
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000 
Imagine , if Teresa will be 

102 
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,959 
I do not understand. How am I? 

103 
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000 
You do not continue wanting to go down again 

104 
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,959 
You call me in one's own family 
Can not say this ? 

105 
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000 
My father, if I were you, how am I? 

106 
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,959 
It doesn't matter. Needn't be afraid that she said 

107 
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,959 
What you said can not go wrong. Certainly, you are right 

108 
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,956 


109 
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,959 
Even so, I have thought that you should ¡­
Do not know ¡­Besides, 

110 
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,956 
Carlos 

111 
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,956 
I love you 

112 
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000 
Teresa 

113 
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,956 
I can not fall asleep 

114 
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,959 
How do I sit with you? 

115 
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,959 
Shouldn't really let her write those things 

116 
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,959 
How could prevent her? That is her work 

117 
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,956 
Come 

118 
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000 
I am sorry, disturb you 

119 
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000 
Have you seen this woman ? Missing two months ago 

120 
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000 
Do not have 

121 
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,959 
Sir, have you seen this woman ? 

122 
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000 
How is it? 

123 
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000 
It is very good. Act two is good 

124 
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000 
It's a pity that I have missed 

125 
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000 
Should be more smooth 

126 
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000 
What does he do in that? 

127 
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000 
He is waiting for you. He wants to have a talk with you 

128 
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,959 
He has his questions 

129 
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000 
What's the matter with you? Lucia 

130 
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000 
Please dismiss from me the drama out. 
I will no longer come afterwards 

131 
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000 
Why? 

132 
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,959 
I do not want to say this 

133 
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,959 
Your father has been taken away 

134 
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000 
Who said to you? 

135 
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,959 
Nobody says to me. However, inform my what happened of ÔV 

136 
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,959 
Someone came to my home to take him away early in the morning today 

137 
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,959 
Three people interrogate him tonight 

138 
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,959 
Among them a meeting is said to your father carefully 
Ô’ which his students talked about 

139 
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,959 
An ordinary teacher does not know 
Understand the government's motive 

140 
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,959 
Ask him not to comment on the government's policy again 

141 
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,959 
Your father will promise 

142 
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,959 
They will return to him freely today , this evening 

143 
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,959 
He takes to the adjacent place where you live to use the handlebar 

144 
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,956 
Believe me 

145 
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,959 
Carlos, what's the matter with you? 

146 
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000 
I do not know 

147 
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,959 
It is said that I satisfy the need in the department tonight 
His father will obtain freedom 

148 
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,959 
What have you said to him? 
Why did you do so? 

149 
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000 
I know that you happened in these days 
Some unfortunate things 

150 
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,959 
However, Carlos ¡­

151 
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,959 
I can't prevent . It seems to be the illusion 
Seem that I see personally 

152 
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,959 
Just as the film which I see personally. 
In other words , can see it in the future 

153 
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000 
No, no, it was I that proposed to you 

154 
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000 
It is not like this 

155 
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000 


156 
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000 
My God. I do not dare to believe that you forget Ó› 

157 
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000 
It was I that proposed to you 

158 
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000 
It is impossible, it is impossible 

159 
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000 
How about it? 

160 
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000 
I ask whether you would like to marry me , an idiot! 

161 
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000 
How do I want to ask? 
How do I make you empty-handed? 

162 
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,959 
I think it is that I am explaining me to you 
When why wants to be a reporter 

163 
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000 
Can not you really remember ? 

164 
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000 
I said that I wanted to be a reporter to you 
Ask some cunning problems 

165 
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000 
Then you say, ask me some difficult problems 

166 
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000 
I ask you, would like to marry me? 
Is that right? 

167 
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,959 
You fellow ! You let me make a scene! 

168 
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000 
All right. How did I answer you? 

169 
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,959 
You blush, then the uncanny smile emerges 

170 
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000 
Then what, do not have? 

171 
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,959 
No. You have kissed me. A sweetest kiss 

172 
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000 
Have happen, has happened. 
Sir, just as what you told me 

173 
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,959 
Can not go wrong at one o'clock. Thanks. Thanks 

174 
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,959 
Go, I am very glad 

175 
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,959 
Listen, Lucia, you go down first , we will discuss to stay again 

176 
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,959 
It must be only the coincidence 

177 
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,956 
Not 

178 
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,956 
Not 

179 
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,959 
Please come to see me. Perhaps I can help you 

180 
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,956 
Let's sit down 

181 
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,959 
Thank you for coming to my home 

182 
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,959 
I, I do not know how to explain to everybody 

183 
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,959 
Because even I myself can not say clearly 

184 
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,959 
I can only say I perhaps to everybody 
Can help some people present 

185 
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,959 
Offer some information to those relatives 
Missing person 

186 
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,959 
I must know their name 
With the environment around the missing place 

187 
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,959 
If I fail, ask everybody to excuse me 

188 
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000 
Everything of us till now No 

189 
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,959 
But I want to try or worth 

190 
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000 
My grandson calls Dabio.Maerj 
A athlete 

191 
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,959 
Last month was taken away. 
He has never been interested in politics 

192 
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,959 
What a pity. I am sorry. There is no function 

193 
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000 
Gentleman ¡­

194 
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,959 
I am sorry. I think it of no use. I am sorry 

195 
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,959 
My son Becet, only 15 years old 

196 
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,959 
Will be to some things that he does not understand sometimes 
Say some so 

197 
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,959 
He had not come back from the school last Friday 

198 
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,959 
Becet. Madrid 

199 
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,959 
Yes. When he came out from the school 

200 
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,959 
He has taken a handlebar to 
More than ten minutes and a far place of journey 

201 
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000 
They are planning to kill him 

202 
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,959 
No, do not have 

203 
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,959 
There is a very familiar place to carry out a death sentence 
So someone monitors 

204 
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000 
And they have rescued Becet 

205 
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000 
He is with them now 

206 
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,959 
But you will have his news soon 
He knows give you send information. There is no wrong 

207 
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,959 
Sir, my daughter is called Fulirid . 
She is a society worker 

208 
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,959 
Missing in the office three weeks ago 

209 
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,956 
It is a pity 

210 
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,956 
I am very sorry 

211 
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,959 
Will tell you that if you like, I would wait for. 
Any detail that you want to know 

212 
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,959 
My mother calls Cecilia 

213 
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,959 
Someone take her from the family away will it be one May 

214 
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,959 
As my father comes back from the theatre 
She is not here 

215 
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,956 
Hands 

216 
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,959 
Teresa. He is very strong. Very strong 

217 
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,959 
Idea that has never given up escaping in her soul 

218 
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,959 
She did last night , last night 

219 
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,959 
Jump, jump . Run, run. Run, run, run ¡­

220 
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,956 
Carlos 

221 
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000 
She has failed 

222 
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,956 
No, not 

223 
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000 
What has happened? How have you been? 

224 
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,959 
What a pity. Perhaps I shouldn't ask you 

225 
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,959 
What you did can not go wrong. You have done the thing that should be done 

226 
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,959 
However, I have failed. Why do I fail? 

227 
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,956 
You are too tired 

228 
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,956 
Not 

229 
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000 
Wrong like this, though what you said is true 

230 
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,959 
But I do not understand why you can say that it is real to meet accident 

231 
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,959 
This is truth . Don't ask why I can make sure 

232 
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000 
However, I do not know either 

233 
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,959 
But this is illogical. 
I know that you only believe reason 

234 
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000 
But I want to believe the things happened on me 

235 
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000 
This is very absurd 

236 
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,959 
Request! I have not had strength and you to dispute now 

237 
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000 
To tell the truth, please go. We put it aside afterwards 

238 
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000 
How about you? 

239 
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,959 
I stayed for a moment 

240 
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000 
Hearing 

241 
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,956 
Anything 

242 
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,959 
In a place near port 

243 
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000 
Dad, what's the matter with you? 

244 
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000 
Bring some water for me 

245 
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000 
I know that she has ever stayed in that. I can feel 

246 
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,956 
Don't move 

247 
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000 
Why not leave her mark ? 

248 
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000 
Why can I totally feel? 

249 
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000 
I can not find my wife. What's the matter? 

250 
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000 
You will go to bed for a moment. 
Teresa, get dressed the school 

251 
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000 
Let me look after your father 

252 
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000 
No, no, I want to go back to the theater 

253 
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000 
No, Carlos. Don't want to go back 

254 
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000 
Please go. I stayed and looked after my father 

255 
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,959 
I think that it is done that we just let her say 

256 
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,959 
Teresa, I can't control myself 

257 
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,959 
You will find mother. I know that you will accomplish 

258 
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,959 
The child, have no you I can not bear alone 

259 
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,956 
I sleep for a moment 

260 
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,956 
Your wife? 

261 
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,956 


262 
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,956 
My Merd

263 
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,959 
I do not know that there is not Merd I 
Whether can continue living on 

264 
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000 
Do you find out about our party? 

265 
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,959 
Yes. Trying to condense strength 

266 
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,959 
OK. I, until next Thursday 

267 
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000 
I only want to express thanks to everybody 

268 
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,959 
Allow me to share our impression with everybody 
I hope for lances at the same time 

269 
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000 
I do not still understand another thing till now 

270 
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,959 
Courage. Necessary courage, in order to defend ¡­

271 
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000 
Calm, calm 

272 
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,959 
Unlock me, unlock me 

273 
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000 
The officer is very busy now 

274 
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,959 
However, I think of and please tell him that Carlos want to see him 

275 
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,959 
This is Carlos gentleman 
Whether the gentleman can see him to want to know the minister 

276 
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000 
What can I do for you? 

277 
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000 
I want to expose the thing that nine women are arrested 

278 
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000 
They have been taken away from the church 
Among them there are two nuns 

279 
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000 
Sit down, please 

280 
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,956 
Thanks 

281 
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000 
When such a thing happen do you think? 

282 
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000 
This morning 

283 
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000 
Have just happened. How can think I you 
Can know quickly then 

284 
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,959 
I am not omnipotent 

285 
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000 
The nun? Is what you said? 

286 
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,959 
Yes. This is their owner's name. Look 

287 
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000 
Thanks 

288 
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000 
I will be responsible for this thing in person 

289 
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,959 
In fact , it is said that you have directed 
A child's drama 

290 
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000 


291 
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000 
I say that I hear 

292 
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000 
But I know that my nephew has ever seen one 

293 
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000 
But though does not remember the fact 
Have explained anything. But extraordinary ¡­

294 
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000 
My wife 

295 
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,959 
My wife is missing too 

296 
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000 
Fantastic! This is too terrible. 
I understand your worry 

297 
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000 
What is her name? 

298 
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,959 
Cecilia. A reporter 

299 
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000 
What a pity. This nobody calls this name 

300 
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000 
Should have 

301 
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000 
Why? Is she a terrorist? 
What crime is made? 

302 
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000 
No, do not have. She is not a terrorist 

303 
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,959 
It is some factions that have caught some citizens 
Carry on the judgement to them 

304 
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,959 
They draw all kinds of things 

305 
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000 
What's the matter with your arms? 

306 
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,956 
Have been bitten by the dog 

307 
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,959 
Your life is very abundant 

308 
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,959 
As you saw a group of mothers 

309 
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000 
The animal all have their own mother 

310 
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000 
They want to find one's own child. 
And I, want to find my wife 

311 
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000 
I have already said to you 
I will be responsible for this 

312 
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,959 
I have written down and investigated this in person 

313 
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,959 
Meanwhile, I advise you to get back to your theater 

314 
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,959 
I acknowledge that I do not really like you for your new content of drama 

315 
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000 
What do you mean? 

316 
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,956 
Betrayal 

317 
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000 
If you do not like my new directory 

318 
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,959 
Is it alike that that is that you can not catch it? Meaning 
It is what you can't understand 

319 
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,959 
And will have the result finally. 
Study carefully 

320 
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000 
What do I lack? 

321 
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,956 
Imagination 

322 
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,956 
Cecilia 

323 
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,959 
Cecilia ¡­

324 
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,959 
Help ¡­Cecilia ¡­

325 
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000 
You keep crying 

326 
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,959 
I am free. I am free. I have had horrible nightmares. 
Wait a moment 

327 
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,956 
Careful of the foot 

328 
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000 
Come. Don't worry. Don't worry. 
I will try one's best to avoid recuring 

329 
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,959 
How is it? It doesn't matter 

330 
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000 
Dad, are you free? 

331 
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,959 
Yes. Put on the clothes. We will leave this ÑY 

332 
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,959 
I am sorry. Hope not to frighten you 

333 
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000 
Come in , come in 

334 
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000 
I think that Teresa is unsafe in our home 

335 
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,959 
Then stay here 
How long does it think dull at will. You are too 

336 
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,959 
Thanks. Thanks 

337 
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000 
That is to say , you have reached a grassland by car 

338 
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000 
Because you dream about an owl 

339 
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000 
Must I believe this? Promise 

340 
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000 
I do not know that I still can do anything . 
I do not know 

341 
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000 
The drama is not one can 
Trade of operating by oneself 

342 
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,959 
You know. Watch? Think on Thursday evening 
Buy tickets to go to the theater to go to the theater 

343 
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,959 
Hearing : We are responsible for the drama. 
You go to look for your owl 

344 
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000 
I will find 

345 
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,959 
I do not know what can find 
But I know that I can find to some extent 

346 
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,959 
Welcome to and hope for the farm. 
My name is Foye. My wife Sema 

347 
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,956 
Carlos 

348 
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000 
What do you come here to do? 

349 
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,959 
I am looking for my wife 

350 
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,959 
The thing is very complicated 

351 
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,959 
I think in such a family 
Say that this thing picture is making mistakes 

352 
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000 
If you can not find her forever 
Carlos? 

353 
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000 
I will find her 

354 
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000 
This is still hopeful faith 

355 
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,959 
But every hope is different 

356 
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,959 
What does the supper want to eat? Spend the night in this in the evening 

357 
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,956 
Thanks 

358 
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,956 
Thanks 

359 
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000 
When we have guests 
She prefers one piece of oneself to be eaten 

360 
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000 
We have almost had no guest in 100% ground 

361 
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000 
Your daughter? 

362 
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000 
Not just 

363 
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,959 
Our old friend's daughter. 
We once stayed in A together the Amiqie 

364 
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,959 
A shy woman. In addition, she can't speak 

365 
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,959 
Someone wants a thing from her one day 
Then cut down her tongue with the knife 

366 
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,959 
Why do you understand us now 
Can understand what you said 

367 
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000 
Why did you decide to come to Argentina? 

368 
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000 
This place belonged to my home seven years ago 

369 
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000 
We have a son in this 

370 
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000 
We sent him to our cousin this 

371 
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000 
In the thirties, he, still very as a child 

372 
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000 
Because we know that there were questions at that time in Germany 

373 
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,959 
Even we want to come, but has determined too late 

374 
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000 
He runs a shop now 

375 
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000 
You get back to Buenos Aires 
When go visit he 

376 
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000 
Thanks. I knew 

377 
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000 
My cousin passed away at the age of 40 
Leave for us in this farm 

378 
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,959 
People ask that we are strange in this 
Place survive 

379 
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,959 
I say it can only be all right in the place where the friendship can be reached 

380 
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,959 
Why do you have so many birds? 

381 
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,959 
Our original place has a lot of birds too 

382 
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000 
We pass, they will let us think of freedom 

383 
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,959 
Can never come back after flying away 

384 
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,959 
When we reached Buenos Aires 

385 
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,959 
We have gone to bird's market to buy 
A lot of birds of kind take to this 

386 
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000 
To us, they have represented those 
Friend that goes far from us 

387 
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,959 
They still live in this farm 

388 
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000 
How can this? 

389 
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,959 
Yes, can not. But the one that should use imagining 

390 
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000 
So what you said to us is very important 

391 
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000 
She can the purpose will insist on the life 

392 
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,959 
Continue your story 

393 
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,959 
Cecilia ¡­

394 
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000 
I have not seen her in that 

395 
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,959 
Not in that warehouse like last time. 
Other dissipation 

396 
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,959 
But this time I am not so desperate 

397 
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,959 
I know that she should be just nearby. 
But I know that I have no ability to find her 

398 
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,959 
Because for a certain reason 
I am unable to understand some thing 

399 
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,959 
My intuition tells me to be her 
She will find me 

400 
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000 
It's your turn 

401 
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,959 
No, no. I take her to prison house 

402 
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,959 
You do not know what you miss 

403 
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000 
I only want to help you 

404 
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000 
It is too late. Do you think? 

405 
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000 
Affirm that I do not like here either 

406 
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000 
But why do you want to join? 

407 
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,959 
This is my work. Like my father 
Have received the pressure 

408 
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000 
I think for recent years of work of yours 
Have changed very greatly. Is that right? 

409 
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000 
Yes. Have left different from the original one 

410 
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000 
So ¡­

411 
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000 
I have children, I need to work 

412 
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,959 
I am sure if you insist on 
Can find another job 

413 
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000 
It is time to do exercises 

414 
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000 
I do not want to go 

415 
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000 
But why? 

416 
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000 
Stayed this ÑY by me 

417 
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000 
OK. I say to them that you are uncomfortable 

418 
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,956 
OK 

419 
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000 
But, what do you do? 

420 
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,956 
I am remembering 

421 
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000 
I see 

422 
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000 
Do not remember over. I do not mean over 

423 
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000 
But this, recall everything of this 

424 
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,959 
Even minimum detail, I will never forget 

425 
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000 
At the beginning 

426 
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,959 
My younger sister Maerd 
The officer works together, is his secretary 

427 
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000 
One day, she stays in the office alone 

428 
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000 
She has found a thing on the desk 

429 
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000 
I do not know what it is 
Because she fears 

430 
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,959 
The officer has come in 
Happen to see her see that thing 

431 
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,959 
Then hit her, dismiss her 

432 
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,959 
Someone goes to the place where she lives to look for her that evening 

433 
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,959 
Please help me 

434 
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000 
I know that you will help me to find him 

435 
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,959 
I can't see clearly now that Maerd yet 

436 
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,959 
But there are some other things 

437 
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,959 
What I saw is Niermad 

438 
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000 
He thought that his father was dangerous 

439 
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000 
He has a sacred mission of protecting him 

440 
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,959 
Very strange, what I saw is not those victims 

441 
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000 
Have you ever become a performer? 

442 
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000 
Do not have 

443 
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000 
Have you never been to my theater too? 

444 
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,956 
Have not had 

445 
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,959 
I think that I can see agate reach 

446 
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,959 
Golden yellow hair, mere body 
It seems that they divide her into in half 

447 
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,956 
Quite right! 

448 
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,959 
Why you guess that he wants to murder one 
Reach the modest girl as the agate? 

449 
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,959 
Look, when the Maerd is kidnapped 
Maerd found a strange thing 

450 
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000 
Officer that she took her away after recognizing that one 

451 
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,959 
And find that she is totally 
Is that young man imaginary Thing 

452 
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,959 
That officer is you 
You have no sister. You become a detective in this 

453 
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,959 
I thought that you would help us. 
Our all are victims in this 

454 
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000 
How could you say these words? 

455 
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000 
Your shirt ÑY has been brought a recorder 

456 
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,959 
If I get it wrong, excuse me 

457 
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000 
I can explain 

458 
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,959 
No, no. It is enough, it is enough ¡­

459 
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,959 
This is messages for you, the Niermal general 

460 
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,959 
We are not criminals 
We want our relative to come back 

461 
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,959 
We are full of hatred and distrust 

462 
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,959 
Get away, get away ¡­

463 
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000 
Still smile! 

464 
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,959 
Calm, calm, let him leave 

465 
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,956 
The next one 

466 
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000 
We should kill that wretch this afternoon 

467 
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,956 
No, not 

468 
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000 
If I say that this evening I will feel much better 

469 
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,959 
Will you say that I am crazy ? 

470 
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000 
May I leave this evening? 

471 
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000 
No, no. You will go back with plum 

472 
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,959 
Dad, has asked you. 
Let me stay. This evening 

473 
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,956 
All right 

474 
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000 
My father. My father ¡­.
Unlock me ¡­.Unlock me ¡­

475 
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,959 
Teresa ¡­Teresa ¡­
Have ask you, has asked you ¡­

476 
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,959 
Help. Dad, my father ¡­

477 
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,959 
Lead me to walk, lead me to go 

478 
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,959 
What? What do you say? 

479 
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000 
Carlos, don't leave and judge so early 

480 
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,959 
It will not too difficult to find her 
It will be in every to leave her alone 

481 
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000 
Teresa 

482 
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,959 
Mother ¡­

483 
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,959 
Stand up. We left. You, you do not use. 
You do our food this time 

484 
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,956 
Go out 

485 
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,959 
Here we begin from it is simple first 

486 
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000 
If you are clear, you would like 

487 
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,959 
If does not know , then you should suffer hardships 

488 
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,959 
First thing which we two want to do 
Understand each other better 

489 
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,956 
Gentleman ¡­

490 
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,959 
Teresa, Cecilia ¡­

491 
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000 
The drama will be postponed. Definite. 
Why insist on ? This is a disaster 

492 
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000 
I agree with Carlos 

493 
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,959 
Is that right? Too unexpected 

494 
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,956 
What's the matter? 

495 
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000 
Perhaps it was reasonable that you spoke 

496 
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,959 
Oh, don't think me reasonable . 
In this way , will let me fell too ashamed to show one's face 

497 
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000 
Today's performance is very important 

498 
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,959 
They, in there, the third platoon 

499 
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,959 
What I worried about is they to come for me? 
Do you think that they have found me? 

500 
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,959 
Ready, ready

Good luck to you!

Thanks 

503 
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,959 
The red death incident corroding 
For a long time we 

504 
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,959 
There is not a kind of wild animal of any 
Kill others and terrible so 

505 
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000 
The victim's corpse mark is full of stains or spots 

506 
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,959 
Similar help and pity 
Make people think that is isolated all the same too 

507 
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,959 
But it is happy to think of prince Bolos.Bele

508 
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,959 
That tell is once that he holds now 
The only freshest makeup ball that has never been seen 

509 
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,956 
Who are you? 

510 
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,959 
Reveal his true features 

511 
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000 
They help Ciliy to take away 

512 
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000 
What? 

513 
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000 
I say to them that they have got it wrong 

514 
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000 
He has not interest at all to politics 

515 
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,959 
However, his name is on the list 

516 
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,959 
Why be so? They should take me away . 
Damn it. Murderer! 

517 
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,959 
Carlos, they have broken the theater 
Object to our performing in public the drama 

518 
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,959 
I strive for them and return original work to me 

519 
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,959 
I will find him 

520 
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,959 
We knew as a child 
Became the lover 34 years ago 

521 
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,956

Will reach in garden this evening 

524 
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,959 
I have a companion who let Ciliy be helped 
A director of children's drama 

525 
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,959 
Someone has come to his office to take him away 

526 
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,959 
Ciliy is helped in the mechanical schools of arms 
He is covered with eyes having no cause 

527 
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,959 
Taken to a little black pavilion son, he fears very much 

528 
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000 
Determine to confess the thing that they want to hear 

529 
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,959 
No matter who he is he exposes, prevents from and is tormented 

530 
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,959 
Him they under one one week 
Take to a room of end of the corridor 

531 
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,959 
At that time, Ciliy was helped and happened 
Some strange things 

532 
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,959 
His thrombus increases 
Until a word of his can not say either 

533 
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,959 
Finally, one month later, he can not persevere 

534 
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,959 
I am helped by Ciliy, Argentines 

535 
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,959 
I am sorry. Really very sorry

Even everything can not be done 

537 
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000

Yes. Do we know? 

541 
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000 
I was once hoping in the farm 
Have stayed with your parents for a few days 

542 
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000 
You are Carlos 

543

My mother writes to me and refers to you. 
Do you want to come to my home? 

545 
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000

01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000 
While staying together with your parents 
It is really inconceivable, even can't imagine 

549 
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,959 
Don't say so . I assure you that is true 

550 
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,956 
What's the matter with you? 

551 
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000 
What is that? 

552 
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000 
That shoes? 

553 
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000 
How long is it in that? 

554 
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000 
A neighbour hung that originally 

555 
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000 
I go to have a talk with her 

556 
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000 
Carlos 

557 
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,956 
This is very important 

558 
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000 
What's the matter? 

559 
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000 
It is about that shoes 

560 
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,956 
What's the matter with it? 

561 
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,959 
What has woman who has lost the shoes talked when being taken away? 

562 
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,959 
Have referred to Carlos' name 

563 
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000 
Are you Carlos? 

564 
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,959 
Yes, is my wife 

565 
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,959 
Then you should take the shoes away 

566 
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,956 
She is still alive 

567 
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,956 
Gentleman 

568 
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,959 
I have decided , your daughter at time 
Give to another person 

569 
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,959 
But who? 
I have thought or you select a bit more fairly 

570 
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000 
Who? 

571 
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000 
I do not want to do so 

572 
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,959 
You should punish you in here. 
Want you to select to be a part punishing too 

573 
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000 
Let they and I 

574 
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,959 
They are fed up about you. I am tired of her too. 
So woolen cloth, you should cooperate and click 

575 
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,956 
I am waiting 

576 
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000 
All right. You, Alt, lead her to leave 

577 
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,959 
A bit stronger, a bit stronger ¡­

578 
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,959 
No, no, not ¡­

579 
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,956 
She died 

580 
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000 
Suddenly I understood something 

581 
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000 
Don't ask me why she had not died yet 
Why will I commit suicide 

582 
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000 
Later on I swim to the sandy beach hard 

583 
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,959 
When I arrived 
When you know, ask me issue 

584 
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000 
Cecilia on May 23 , 1976 
Taken away from this home 

585 
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,959 
His husband is on the floor of the bedroom 
Have found her glasses 

586 
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,959 
Let's take her to outside 

587 
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000 
I am Theo, how about you? 

588 
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,959 
Do you want to spend the night with me? 
I, feel very lonely 

589 
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000 
I can't stay in the whole evening here 

590 
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,959 
I only think that you cherish you and stay for a moment 

591 
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000 
Wait for a moment. You undress first 

592 
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000 
But I think that you have taken off 

593 
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,959 
You just like other people then 

594 
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,956 
OK 

595 
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,959 
This is our last meeting 

596 
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000 
The thing changes too fast 

597 
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,959 
Officer of those that I hope for you carefully 
They will never worry about those missing persons 

598 
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000 
Also no matter they are missing there has been already a lot of number of people 

599 
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000 
They leave nothing for us 
Except those missing faces 

600 
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,959 
They will let you forget these years soon 
Nothing happens to seem obvious these years 

601 
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,959 
So woolen cloth, should think that the truth exist forever 
Can only depend on us 

602 
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,959 
They know that their days are few 

603 
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,959 
Because the prison is empty 
Bury the corpse, corrode the children 

604 
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,959 
Their invitation safeguards the foreign reporter of human rights 

605 
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000 
Tell them that here have speeches freedom issued 

606 
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,959 
The theater all open too, have Carnival in the street. 
Everything is over 

607 
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,959 
However, what they really wanted to say is 
They are just over temporarily, will come again next time 

608 
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,956 
Good night! 

609 
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000 
Thanks 

610 
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000 
I do not know that we should maintain it 

611 
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000 
Everything should be left and remembered like this 

612 
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000 
Then we start from scratch 

613 
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000 
I want to involve something else again at first 

614 
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,959 
Do you think you need? 

615 
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000 
I have ever thought of giving a happy final result 

616 
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,959 
Just like " dangerous mountain " of drama, remember? 

617 
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000 
Finally, Heaven forgave him 
Return his wife to him 

618 
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,959 
Why do not we try ? 

619 
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000 
Which kind do you want? 

620 
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,956 
All 

621 
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,959 
Carlos ¡­

622 
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,959 
Carlos ¡­

623 
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,959 
During 1976-1983 military dictatorship in Argentina 
30,000 people are missing, including woman children 

624 
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,959 
In 1990, president Carlos announced 
Absolve those slaughterers unconditionally 

625 
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,959 
History no longer recurs!
