You know what I'm thinking?

357
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:17,241
<i>That they're looking
for the same spy we are.</i>

358
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:20,811
They're looking
for the same spy we are.

359
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:49,506
<i>Looks like a guard roster.</i>

360
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,542
They're not kidding around.

361
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:54,545
Whoever Danny's target is,
the Russians want him bad.

362
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,924
<i>Winston...
[cell phone ringing]</i>

363
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,859
Hang on a second.

364
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,361
What do you got?

365
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,962
<i>I just left
Aaron's apartment.</i>

366
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:14,732
The poison's here, dude.
It's airborne, and it's lethal.

367
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:22,006
<i>(Winston)
But Chance was in there too.</i>

368
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,308
Winston, we have a problem.

369
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,902
<i>(Winston)
You got in there not long
after Aaron did,</i>

370
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:36,671
<i>so I don't know how much time
that gives you</i>

371
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:37,839
<i>in terms of symptoms.</i>

372
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,407
<i>(Chance)
Which are?</i>

373
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,242
Uh...

374
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,044
Swings in body temperature,

375
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:44,412
Um, dizziness.

376
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:48,249
<i>Degraded dexterity
and motor skills.</i>

377
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,551
Chance?

378
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,220
<i>Chance, are you
still reading?</i>

379
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:54,055
Still here,
just not listening.

380
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,357
<i>Hey, ignoring this is not
gonna make it go away.</i>

381
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:57,558
<i>Now, we may need
to change the plan</i>

382
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,659
<i>and get you out of there.</i>

383
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,894
There's only one way
out of here.

384
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:01,262
I find the threat
before the Russians do,

385
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,765
or Aaron and I
run out of time.

386
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:06,300
There are two things
I know to be true.

387
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:07,668
If I were a prostitute,

388
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:09,570
I'd be a damn
expensive one.

389
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,406
And you are not
C.C. Baxter.

390
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,607
Did the hooker just punch you
in the face?

391
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,810
I don't think
she's a prostitute.

392
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,485
[crack]

393
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,302
Okay, let's--

394
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,407
Last night
Danny turns up dead,

395
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,409
And then you turn up
using his cover.

396
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,911
Doesn't take a genius
to figure out

397
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,245
You're the spy
we've been hunting.

398
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,246
We?

399
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,614
Now you're gonna
come with me,

400
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:54,715
and we're gonna
exit the embassy,

401
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:56,951
And you're gonna answer
my questions.

402
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,586
No, I'm not.

403
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:01,189
One, I'm not a spy.
I'm a friend of Danny's.

404
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,492
Two, the femoral artery bleeds
just as fast as the jugular.

405
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,628
And three, I've been poisoned by
the spy that you're looking for.

406
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:08,963
I don't find him, I die.

407
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,064
So I think maybe we're looking
for the same guy.

408
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,499
Now, don't take this
the wrong way,

409
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,800
But I'm having a little bit
of a hard time breathing,

410
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:14,902
So can you just
get off of me, please?

411
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:26,547
I suppose you're one
of those scumbag mercenaries

412
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:28,249
that Danny always
talked about.

413
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,018
<i>(Chance)
Yeah, Danny and I had
some pretty good times.</i>

414
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,121
That's not
exactly what I meant.

415
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,655
You seem a little sheltered
for C.I.A.

416
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,491
Plus, you don't really
fight dirty enough.

417
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,593
So I'm guessing...
F.B.I.?

418
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,461
Emma Barnes.

419
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,363
I was Danny's liaison
with the bureau.

420
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:44,532
We were working together
to track down

421
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,200
a freelance spy,
codename Raven.

422
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,502
<i>He's been
a major security breach</i>

423
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,803
<i>for us for years--</i>

424
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,805
Stealing intel,
selling to anyone who'll pay,

425
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,207
and leaving a trail
of bodies in his wake.

426
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,542
Well, apparently,
he wasn't just a problem for us.

427
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,611
Volkov had a small army
on the lookout for him.

428
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:59,046
If the Russians
get a hold of him,

429
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,248
he'll give them
everything--

430
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,517
Classified information,
state secrets.

431
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:04,118
We'll never be able to stop
the bleeding.

432
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,853
Not sure how much I care
about that.

433
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,188
But if we're gonna
help each other,

434
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:09,123
I need to know
what was gonna happen today.

435
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:17,231
Raven stole the plans for
some kind of weapons prototype,

436
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:19,700
something the U.S. Government
would very much prefer

437
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,335
not to fall
into the wrong hands.

438
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:24,305
He's gonna sell those plans
here today at the embassy,

439
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,740
use this event as a cover.

440
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:27,275
If we don't catch him
making the sale,

441
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:30,044
which my intel
has going down at 5:00,

442
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:31,045
<i>he cashes out
and vanishes.</i>

443
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:32,880
And I lose my shot
at the antidote.

444
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:35,049
Let's get moving.

445
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,685
You first.

446
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:39,053
I don't ever turn my back

447
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:40,988
on someone
who does this for money.

448
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,524
<i>(Wilton)
Well, I don't think
I like her very much.</i>

449
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,725
Neither do I.

450
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:45,760
I didn't get your name.

451
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,328
Sure didn't.

452
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,770
Well, it took you
long enough.

453
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:59,273
Feel free to bring it up
at my next performance review.

454
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:01,842
Hey, dude.

455
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,511
Is that a defibrillator?

456
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,580
Nah.

457
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:08,516
Yeah, sorry.
Didn't want to alarm you.

458
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:11,886
Maybe we should revisit
that idea of getting a doctor.

459
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,354
I've already reached out
to the guys I can trust locally.

460
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:14,689
One of them's dead,
the other's in prison.

461
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,192
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

462
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:24,098
You're sure you know
what you're doing?

463
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,867
You could say I got some
experience in this area.

464
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:29,503
[alarm blaring]

465
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:35,543
<i>(Winston)
All right, Guerrero's here</i>

466
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,211
<i>working on deciphering
Danny's notes.</i>

467
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:39,547
<i>We'll see if there's any
information about the drop.</i>

468
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:42,250
<i>(Chance)
You're cutting it pretty close.
It's almost 5:00.</i>

469
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,252
Where do you think
security went?

470
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:46,153
Probably fanned out
across the complex,

471
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:47,154
looking for the drop.

472
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:48,489
Okay, if Raven goes
through the trouble

473
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,591
to set up a meeting
inside the Russian embassy,

474
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:53,628
Wouldn't he want to have it
in a place you'd least suspect?

475
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:54,795
It's gonna happen right here.

476
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:55,930
You still there?

477
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:57,565
I'm here. I'm here.
Go ahead.

478
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,634
<i>You're in a crowded room.
You want to have an exchange.</i>

479
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,901
You don't want anybody
to know about it. How?

480
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,370
<i>Well, for sure
you want to avoid</i>

481
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:03,971
passing anything
hand to hand.

482
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,307
Something hard to monitor.

483
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:07,408
<i>Uh, wireless,</i>

484
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,609
<i>Bluetooth.</i>

485
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,177
Hey, yeah.

486
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,379
<i>You know, that's it.</i>

487
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,080
That's it--
the exchange is gonna happen

488
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,615
<i>via bluetooth device.</i>

489
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:15,750
I got a pairing number
right here.

490
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:17,518
Give me that.

491
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,552
<i>Here it is.</i>

492
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:20,688
Try this--121...

493
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:23,457
<i>467.</i>

494
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,393
You got it?
121467.

495
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,861
<i>(Chance)
I'll give it a shot.</i>

496
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,398
Who are you talking to?

497
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,399
I like to talk to myself.

498
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,566
Do you have a cell phone
I can borrow?

499
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,737
Bluetooth connections
are harder to hack into

500
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:37,738
than phone signals.

501
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:40,508
Unless we have
a pairing code.

502
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:43,911
Phones are linked.
We're in business.

503
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:46,914
Raven's downloading proof
that he has the plans.

504
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:53,554
This isn't a drop.
This is an auction.

505
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:55,222
<i>Why sell to one buyer
when you can get a rom</i>

506
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:56,390
full of the richest men
in the world

507
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:57,625
<i>to bid against each other?</i>

508
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:58,759
<i>It's perfect--
when it's over,</i>

509
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,594
everybody just walks away
scot-free.

510
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:01,796
Bid's already
over $20 million.

511
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:03,297
<i>Bidders
are dropping off fast.</i>

512
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:04,632
If he makes this sale,
we lose him.

513
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,300
Bluetooth range
is only a few dozen meters.

514
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,635
He's gotta be
in these rooms.

515
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,903
Which one?

516
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:09,937
Let's find out.

517
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:11,472
Type in, "this transaction
has been halted

518
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,174
by the U.S. Government."

519
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,644
What if this doesn't work?

520
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:19,046
Well, you get to haul my corpse
to a federal prison.

521
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,930
Hey, there, pal.

522
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:02,556
"Victor Shukoff."

523
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,458
He was a big-time
oil magnate.

524
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:06,360
He must have been
the buyer.

525
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:08,596
Raven made sure we never
got to question him.

526
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:17,872
Don't move.

527
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:26,644
[coughs]

528
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,384
[sighs]

529
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:33,918
You're not
what I thought you were...

530
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,490
not a neanderthal.

531
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:41,659
The thing that you pulled
with the bluetooth back there...

532
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,695
very impressive.

533
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,665
I'm so happy
you're impressed.

534
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,002
And just so you know,
when this is all over

535
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,270
<i>and I get out of here,</i>

536
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:54,439
I am gonna make sure
that you are recognized

537
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,907
for everything
that you did here today.

538
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:58,977
<i>When you get out of here?</i>

539
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:02,313
The bureau will figure out
some sort of bargain

540
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,949
for my release, eventually.

541
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,618
And what about me?

542
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:07,952
Well...

543
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,223
The poison will kill me

544
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:14,125
before we can figure out
a way out of here.

545
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:19,531
But listen, if you need me
to do anything for you...

546
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:23,401
You know, after the fact...

547
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:25,303
Just let me know.

548
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,886
Hey!

549
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,254
[speaking Russian]

550
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:31,970
[Russian accent]
what am I to do, hmm?

551
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,339
When a prominent
Russian oilman

552
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,474
Is found murdered

553
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:39,110
in my courtyard
of my embassy,

554
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:41,146
stolen Russian property

555
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:44,215
found in his possession,

556
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:49,387
and two americans found
standing over the body

557
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:53,224
with the murder weapon...

558
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:56,794
I am forced to ask myself
this question...

559
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,135
which one of you is Raven?

560
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:11,309
[garbled feedback]

561
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:19,017
Hey! Hey!

562
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:21,452
Aaron. Aaron.

563
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,288
Hey, get in here!

564
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,262
Aaron! Aaron!

565
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:32,664
I'm pretty sure
he can't hear you.

566
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:34,098
His heart stopped.
I know.

567
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,067
We're gonna start it again.

568
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,102
The instructions?

569
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:40,271
You were reading
the instructions?

570
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:41,673
They put these things
on school buses now.

571
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,741
We're not children here.
We can figure this thing out.

572
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,244
You said you were experienced
at this kind of thing!

573
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,879
I got experience putting people
in this situation,

574
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,614
not getting them out of it.

575
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:50,982
[electronic whirring]

576
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,450
See?
Get on with it,
would you?

577
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,451
Sure.

578
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:54,686
All right.

579
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:57,755
[whirring]
nothing.

580
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,657
[grunts in frustration]

581
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:02,927
Come on, Aaron, come on.

582
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,495
[sighs]

583
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:06,397
Thank God.
We've got a pulse.

584
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:08,132
Uhh.

585
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,968
Let's not throw
a party yet, dude.

586
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,936
<i>The poison's
shutting down his system.</i>

587
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,504
We bought him
a little time, but...

588
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,907
If we don't get
the antidote soon...

589
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:21,312
<i>neither one of us will talk
under these circumstances.</i>

590
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,814
We're being held
unlawfully.

591
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:24,515
You think we murdered Shukoff,
but if you checked our hands,

592
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,317
You wouldn't find
any gun residue.

593
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:29,187
<i>Proves nothing.
Maybe.</i>

594
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:31,489
But somebody in this complex
has proof on their hands

595
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,658
that they
fired a gun recently.

596
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,727
Now, if you puthe word out
that you're taking samples,

597
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:38,630
I guarantee you
Raven would make a run for it.

598
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:40,865
You're the head cop.

599
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,101
Think like a cop.

600
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:46,638
This is exactly
what Raven wants--

601
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,373
Danny's poison
to look like a Russian hit.

602
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:49,807
They frame us
for Shukoff's murder.

603
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,709
We're going back and forth
with each other

604
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,944
while he gets away.

605
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:56,281
You have every reason to lie.

606
00:30:56,282 --> 00:30:57,615
Why should I believe you?

607
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:02,086
[speaking Russian]

608
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,793
[speaking Russian]

609
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:13,998
Listen...

610
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:17,368
I'm a friend
of Raven's last victim.

611
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:21,306
Thing is,
I've been poisoned too.

612
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,707
And I've got...

613
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:25,076
30 minutes
or less to live.

614
00:31:25,077 --> 00:31:26,978
Now, everything's out.
We're all telling the truth.

615
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,714
And we all want
the same thing.

616
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:31,015
[door opens]

617
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,283
[approaching footsteps]

618
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:40,992
The state department liaison

619
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:42,627
is demanding access
to see you.

620
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:47,598
Watch them.

621
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:51,035
Are you out of your mind?

622
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,603
You just compromised my cover
on my entire project.

623
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,272
And for what?
To save your own butt.

624
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,974
Well, I'm kind of
attached to it.

625
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:59,377
But that's not what
I'm thinking about right now.

626
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,912
No? What's that?

627
00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:02,547
How does he know we're here?

628
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:04,215
[buzzer]

629
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,084
[door opens]

630
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,852
The two of you all right?

631
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,854
So far.

632
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,090
I want you to know
I'm going to formally protest

633
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,391
<i>the treatment
you've received here.</i>

634
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,726
This is outrageous!

635
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,060
Mr. Blanchard,

636
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,196
I agreed to allow you access
to see these two,

637
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,998
<i>to show that they have
not been mistreated.</i>

638
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:22,734
If we can agree
this is the case,

639
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,369
then I will
ask you to leave.

640
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,536
I can't agree to that.

641
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,839
You've caught
two american spies here.

642
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,007
How can I be sure if I leave,
they'll be treated fairly?

643
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:31,442
We're not spies.

644
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,277
Of course you are--

645
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:34,779
A spy known as Raven,

646
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,581
<i>Caught in the act,</i>

647
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:37,582
and who, when captured,

648
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,916
managed to kill
three soldiers

649
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,985
and the chief of security.

650
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:03,641
Where's the antidote, Raven?

651
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:17,455
[gunshot]

652
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,892
[gunshots]

653
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:38,973
What are you doing?

654
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,875
Looking for keys.

655
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,110
Can't we just pick it?

656
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:46,714
Right. Next idea.

657
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,719
Did you get all that?

658
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,288
I didn't get much,
but I heard gunfire.

659
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:54,355
You all right?

660
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:55,723
<i>For the most part.</i>

661
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:57,158
Blanchard's got a key on him.

662
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:00,595
Potomac Motor Inn,
room 12.

663
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,297
<i>It's right down the road.</i>

664
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:03,932
Maybe he's got the antidote
stashed in there.

665
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,233
<i>All right, room 12.
We're on our way now.</i>

666
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,868
We'll pick you up
at the embassy, west gate.

667
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,540
What are you doing?

668
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,442
This doesn't look good
for either one of us.

669
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,911
There's evidence on this thing
of what just went down.

670
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:19,614
I can make my case,
clear my name.

671
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:20,582
Excuse me.

672
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:24,152
What are you doing?

673
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:29,090
Oh, what's the matter
with you?

674
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,159
The video of this entire thing
was stored in there.

675
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,727
I know. It's got my face
on there too.

676
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:34,095
We can't have that
floating around.

677
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:35,864
It's bad for business.

678
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,098
Sorry.
Sorry?

679
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,132
Sorry?
You're sorry?

680
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:39,868
How am I gonna prove
any of this?

681
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,703
That sounds like
a tomorrow problem.

682
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,770
Let's get out of here.

683
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:45,306
There's another exit.

684
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:47,408
Service entrance
by the east gate.

685
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,278
Damn it! They must
have found the bodies.

686
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,447
That doesn't look
promising.

687
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,586
[groans]

688
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,060
Shouldn't I drive?

689
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,618
He's got to keep it cold.

690
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:45,667
Dude, I got the antidote.
I'm heading to you now.

691
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,437
[crowd gasping]

692

[tires squeal]

695
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:45,426
Now what?

696
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:47,095
[tires squeal]

697
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:49,230
Don't even think about it.

698
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,264
You got a better idea?

699
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:52,700
[tires squeal,
glass breaks]

700
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,740
[coughs]

701
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,947
All right,
we're going up and over.

702
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,790
[bangs door]

703
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,865
Come on.
A little help here.

704
00:37:26,135 --> 00:37:27,935
[man shouting in Russian]

705
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,904

00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:37,611
[bullets ricocheting]

708
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:42,816
Come on, on your feet.

709
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:44,484
I need to get you
to the hospital.

710
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,719
I don't think I can get up.

711
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,221
No, you--you can't die.

712
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,555
You're my only witness
to this whole mess.

713
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:50,691
Witness?
I lost Raven.

714
00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:52,059
I was involved
in an international incident

715
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,827
on Russian soil, and...

716
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:56,930
if I lose you,
then who'gonna back me up?

717
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,133
And besides that--

718
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:01,602
[tires squeal]

719
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:07,441
This is gonna hurt, dude.

720
00:38:07,442 --> 00:38:08,542
Who the hell are you?
Ohh.

721
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:11,812
No one special.
Nice dress.

722
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:13,013
Let me see that.

723
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:14,615
That did hurt.

724
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:18,652
(Winston)
Come on, let's go.

725
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,687
Let's go!

726
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:23,323
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
Sorry, lady.

727
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:25,525
How--how am I gonna
get in touch with you?

728
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:26,727
No, no, you can't
just disappear.

729
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,299
I'm--I'm gonna have
to owe you one.

730
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,437
See ya.

731
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:40,474
[tires squeal]

732
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,944
[sighs]

733
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:06,667
Russians are claiming
that Chechen terrorists

734
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,802
<i>tried to seize
their embassy.</i>

735
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,137
"an investigation continues

736
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:13,373
"as to whether the FBI
had an undercover agent

737
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:15,676
within the compound
at the time of the attack."

738
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,377
I'm gonna prove
what happened.

739
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:19,079
Ah, yes.

740
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,915
Your phantom witness, right?

741
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,084
Not a phantom,
a person...

742
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:25,786
with fingerprints...

743
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,187
[electronic bleeping]

744
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:30,357
That the lab
just pulled off of this.

745
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,663
All right, mystery man,

746
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:38,932
<i>Who are you?</i>

747
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:43,170
[footsteps approaching]

748
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:45,872
<i>Hey.</i>

749
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,575
Yeah?

750
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:49,543
You got a visitor.

751
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:55,816
Hi.

752
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:58,085
How you feeling?

753
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:00,754
Better.

754
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:01,722
Come on in.

755
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,460
[grunts]

756
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,299
I read your article.

757
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,202
Danny would've been proud.

758
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:16,136
Thank you.

759
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,307
And thank you...

760
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:21,908
For everything.

761
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:26,747
But I actually had
one more question.

762
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:28,215
Sure.

763
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:30,016
What?

764
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,918
I need to know--

765
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:34,454
Who was my brother, really?

766
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:40,160
(Chance)
He was a lot
of different people.

767
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:43,096
He was whoever he had to be
to get the job done at the time.

768
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,433
That's what made him so good.

769
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,301
No one could ever quite
pin him down.

770
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:50,704
It's kind of
the nature of the job.

771
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:52,773
(Aaron)
Sounds lonely.

772
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:54,408
(Chance)
See, when you're
a guy like Danny,

773
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:55,876
You can't have
any attachments.

774
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:57,177
It distracts focus,

775
00:40:57,178 --> 00:41:00,547
Puts people you care about
in danger.

776
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,017
I'm guessing that's why
he never told you.

777
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:06,753
[sighs]

778
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:14,528
Thank you.

779
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:23,670
Couple of things.

780
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:27,140
One, if anybody asks,
we never met.

781
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:30,277
And if I call,
pick up the phone.

782
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:31,611
It might be important.

783
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:33,613
You got it.

784
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:34,781
Take care.

785
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,493
What's up with you?

786
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:48,595
I got an alert somebody
just ran your prints

787
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:49,763
at the F.B.I.

788
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,500
Oh, yeah.

789
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,268
It must have been climbing
over the wall.

790
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:57,504
I think I got my prints
on her side of the handcuffs.

791
00:41:57,505 --> 00:42:00,474
You left your prints?

792
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:01,675
Why the hell would you leave
your prints?

793
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:02,809
I didn't do it on purpose.

794
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:07,747
You didn't forget
to wipe 'em

795
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:09,349
So she'd have a way
to find you eventually?

796
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:12,853
I saw the two of you
before we picked you up.

797
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:14,387
You think I'd risk everything
for a woman?

798
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:15,555
What am I, 14?

799
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,591
So it was a mistake?

800
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,433
Yes.

801
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:30,203
You're sure?

802
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:32,806
Yes.

803
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:37,911
Winston, if I never
see that woman again,

804
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:39,146
it'll be too soon.

805
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:44,085
Uh-huh.
