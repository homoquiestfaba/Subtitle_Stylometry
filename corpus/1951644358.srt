Why don't leave the family
to work in that for him.

37
00:04:01,430--> 00:04:04,641
You want me to wrap,
or do I only give for you?

38
00:04:04,676--> 00:04:08,228
Why you think yours
does father need a great pooh?

I like to catch the fish
and you pull him/it outside.

42
00:04:19,738--> 00:04:21,823
Not in another way.

43
00:04:24,743--> 00:04:26,453
Here we are.

44
00:04:26,536--> 00:04:28,329

00:04:57,342--> 00:05:03,153
The best and, his/her husband never
anger to do, or he had been exploded.

50
00:05:03,188--> 00:05:04,654
Legal.

51
00:05:04,689--> 00:05:08,533
All of us will be rich, with
the farmer's failure.

52
00:05:08,568--> 00:05:10,827
Which bet will you want to do?

53
00:05:10,862--> 00:05:14,338
Why no he/she pays that Frank?

54
00:05:17,541--> 00:05:21,128
That space clothes, allows me
to control the temperature and the pressure...

55
00:05:21,253--> 00:05:23,338
That I need to go to the space.

56
00:05:23,373--> 00:05:26,341
And as if he/she had his/her own one
climate controller internally.

57
00:05:26,376--> 00:05:29,143
Because in the space and a lot, very cold.

58
00:05:29,552--> 00:05:31,429
Some questions?

59
00:05:31,464--> 00:05:32,763
Uau!

00:05:32,798--> 00:05:37,851
Because they don't lower the hands, I go
to appear, beginning here in front, and you?

61
00:05:37,886--> 00:05:41,438
- Did you buy the clothes?
- No, I didn't buy the clothes.

62
00:05:41,473--> 00:05:42,439
Where did you get?

63
00:05:42,474--> 00:05:47,360
Actually, somebody threw away,
and I just diffused.

64
00:05:47,395--> 00:05:49,562
Were you already in the space?

65
00:05:50,863--> 00:05:53,658

00:05:54,450--> 00:05:59,246
Stanley, is saying for all
on her father the astronaut.

67
00:05:59,371--> 00:06:02,749
We needed more parents
disposed to dress to act.

68
00:06:02,784--> 00:06:06,669
To encourage the children,
to activate their imaginac.es.

00:06:06,704--> 00:06:08,254
Yes lady.

70
00:06:08,289--> 00:06:12,174
Many parents just solve
they appear clowns' dresses.

71
00:06:12,209--> 00:06:16,145
You made a work of high level
to dress with that fantasy.

72
00:06:16,345--> 00:06:19,973
I appreciate that, have a good morning.

73
00:06:42,661--> 00:06:46,456
You and the face of the fuel?

Ah, 20. 20 prorrogac.es,

96
00:08:05,530--> 00:08:08,198
More of the half they are debts that me
I assumed of my father's death.

97
00:08:08,033--> 00:08:11,200
And the bank, assumes that
you will pay of turn.

98
00:08:11,576--> 00:08:13,577
Do you want a piece of advice?

99
00:08:13,612--> 00:08:16,789
I don't have money for
to pay for pieces of advice, Arnold.

100
00:08:16,824--> 00:08:18,499
I don't want to say as

101
00:08:18,534--> 00:08:20,500
- Then no knife.
- But I need.

102
00:08:20,535--> 00:08:25,672
Because I am in first place
friend, and the bank in second, right?

But as friend, I have
that glance in their eyes and saying that:

hour of you to give up.

Because if the father doesn't have that button,

00:13:05,679--> 00:13:08,139
Ei, Hal.
Like you this feeling?

171
00:13:08,174--> 00:13:10,850
I am...
in the reality feeling well.

172
00:13:10,885--> 00:13:15,646
- He/she sits down Hal. Let us go.
- Here, grandpa walking, Oh certain.

173
00:13:18,273--> 00:13:21,651
Farmer, you really did
a great progress.

174
00:13:22,069--> 00:13:23,153
Yes.

175
00:13:24,279--> 00:13:28,950
That will need a lot of potency
to put that specific aircraft...

176
00:13:28,985--> 00:13:30,576
In the space.

177
00:13:30,611--> 00:13:31,577
Yes.

178
00:13:32,078--> 00:13:34,847
I never knew that was like this big.

179
00:13:39,877--> 00:13:45,465
You got for you same one
great value in piece of metal Bug.

180
00:13:45,500--> 00:13:47,550
Here we have one
material of first.

181
00:13:47,759--> 00:13:52,263
I have to sell my tail for
the bank to maintain him/it protected.

182
00:13:52,388--> 00:13:54,265
Farmer?

183
00:13:54,300--> 00:13:57,259
Ei Carlos, as it is going face?

184
00:14:01,063--> 00:14:03,690
I need yours
signature for that letter.

185
00:14:03,725--> 00:14:07,777
Oh! Now, with certainty that
he/she won my attention.

186
00:14:10,863--> 00:14:13,991
- I thank, it ties the close.
- Good-bye.

187
00:14:37,763--> 00:14:38,972
Farmer!

188
00:14:39,007--> 00:14:40,891
You want my house
me Ihe give brick for brick.

189
00:14:41,183--> 00:14:43,268
That era the procedure Farmer.

190
00:14:43,977--> 00:14:45,186
I didn't have choice...

191
00:14:45,270--> 00:14:47,188
The bank more he/she cannot wait
nor one more day, does he/she want to know?

192
00:14:47,223--> 00:14:49,065
Nor me, because you
he/she already passed a lot haul of the limits.

193
00:14:49,100--> 00:14:50,983
He/she gave day forward
you and only a banker.

194
00:14:51,018--> 00:14:52,293
Because a friend
he/she doesn't do what you did.

195
00:14:52,328--> 00:14:54,487
You know that if I didn't worry
with you, I would not order a warning.

196
00:14:54,695--> 00:14:55,905
- Truth?
- You have 30 days.

197
00:14:55,940--> 00:14:58,073
You have to open their eyes,
look, that and a warning to wake up.

198
00:14:58,108--> 00:14:59,366
Because the dream ended,

199
00:14:59,491--> 00:15:02,202
he/she has to stop now, before
that you lose everything, you!

200
00:15:02,285--> 00:15:03,703
Farmer!

201
00:15:03,787--> 00:15:05,580
As this Chopper,
how is it going his/her father?

202
00:15:05,705--> 00:15:08,708
Waiting for you.
Does he/she want a ride?

203
00:15:09,792--> 00:15:12,003
He/she doesn't have problem, follow me.

204
00:15:12,378--> 00:15:14,296
Curse.

205
00:15:15,297--> 00:15:17,508
What did you make Arnold?

206
00:15:19,384--> 00:15:21,386
How much does he owe for the bank Arnold?

207
00:15:21,887--> 00:15:24,180
More than 60 thousand dollars.

208
00:15:24,215--> 00:15:25,598
60 thousand dollars!

209
00:15:25,633--> 00:15:27,809
Him and dangerous,
he threw a brick in me!

210
00:15:27,844--> 00:15:29,894
That and enough Arnold.
It is enough!

211
00:15:29,929--> 00:15:31,687
Does the bank accept excuse?

212
00:15:32,480--> 00:15:36,108
- Well?
- I think so.

213
00:15:36,191--> 00:15:38,986
Farmer, is excused to the bank.

214
00:15:40,112--> 00:15:43,198
Say excuses me.

215
00:15:44,115--> 00:15:46,701
Arnold, excuse me.

216
00:15:47,202--> 00:15:48,911
Great.

217
00:15:48,946--> 00:15:53,499
Now, I will administer one
he/she forms of beating in matter.

218
00:15:54,125--> 00:15:57,419
Chopper can accompany
Arnold outside.

219
00:16:02,507--> 00:16:04,426
Assume the position.

220
00:16:05,427--> 00:16:08,388
You won't beat myself
with that thing, does it go?

221
00:16:08,596--> 00:16:11,224
We go, you know that won't be hit.

222
00:16:11,259--> 00:16:15,311
But with that you put yours
family, and you even in serious risks.

223
00:16:15,346--> 00:16:19,523
One day and a brick,
in the other a candy.

224
00:16:19,558--> 00:16:21,400
Men do
desperate things...

225
00:16:21,525--> 00:16:24,194
When they are to lose the ranch.

226
00:16:24,319--> 00:16:30,199
I will have to ask you for
to do a... psychological evaluation

227
00:16:30,234--> 00:16:32,910
For Arnold to be comfortable
with you in the society...

228
00:16:33,119--> 00:16:35,329
You have to visit a psychiatrist.

229
00:16:35,496--> 00:16:37,331
Go ties the school...

230
00:16:37,366--> 00:16:40,500
He/she sees nurse Goode of there,
and speak to her.

231
00:16:40,626--> 00:16:42,702
It swallows the form of turn for me.

232
00:16:50,426--> 00:16:54,722
- Did you go diffuse for the the one what?
- Sleeping at the room.

233
00:16:55,514--> 00:16:59,226
- And you?
- Broken window.

234
00:17:04,231--> 00:17:07,025
Then, which you go
to want to be when to leave of here?

235
00:17:07,060--> 00:17:10,403
- I don't know.
- The one that you want to say with: Don't I know?

236
00:17:10,438--> 00:17:12,321
I don't know.

237
00:17:12,356--> 00:17:14,532
Well, I will tell you something:

238
00:17:14,567--> 00:17:18,243
And better than you know what wants to do,
before somebody decides for you.

239
00:17:18,278--> 00:17:20,329
Trust me.

240
00:17:20,364--> 00:17:23,707
Farmer, nurse Goode will see you now.

241
00:17:23,748--> 00:17:24,916
Right.

242
00:17:25,151--> 00:17:27,635
Well, good luck.

243
00:17:33,341--> 00:17:34,925
Charles Farmer.

244
00:17:34,960--> 00:17:39,012
Hi, Beth I should give
that for you. The judge ordered.

245
00:17:39,138--> 00:17:41,640
Thank you, right.

246
00:17:41,675--> 00:17:44,934
Hum! You don't think...

247
00:17:44,969--> 00:17:48,646
Justice a little late
would not madness be for you?

248
00:17:48,681--> 00:17:50,523
To jump of a bridge and madness Beth.

249
00:17:50,558--> 00:17:52,441
And to build a rocket no and?

250
00:17:52,476--> 00:17:55,444
I threw a brick for the window,
and for that what am I here, right?

251
00:17:55,479--> 00:17:57,237
Like you it would like
that we talked...

252
00:17:57,321--> 00:17:59,239
His/her desire to leave the planet?

253
00:17:59,740--> 00:18:02,242
- He/she would not like.
- Charles.

254
00:18:02,742--> 00:18:07,830
I didn't hope you went to open up,
and to begin to speak soon in the first section.

255
00:18:07,865--> 00:18:10,750
Section? Does he/she have sec.es?

256
00:18:10,785--> 00:18:12,752
All of us are onions, Charles.

257
00:18:12,787--> 00:18:18,424
We have, many, many,
a lot of layers to cross.

258
00:18:18,465--> 00:18:20,133
Does he/she understand him/it what I am saying?

259
00:18:20,168--> 00:18:22,052
And, and as...

260
00:18:22,135--> 00:18:25,764
well, when he/she peels off an onion,
you make to appear tears that happens...

261
00:18:25,799--> 00:18:27,849
Do Beth, please stop certain?

262
00:18:27,884--> 00:18:31,936
Listen, my father never
he/she told me that he/she loved me.

263
00:18:31,971--> 00:18:36,065
And, you know, I am sure
that his/her father didn't also speak to you.

264
00:18:36,100--> 00:18:37,566
The resentment that you sit down,

265
00:18:38,067--> 00:18:42,446
to torture their relatives doesn't go
to fill his/her rocket of fuel.

266
00:18:43,155--> 00:18:44,864
Did you finish?

267
00:18:44,899--> 00:18:46,658
You no this understanding!

268
00:18:46,693--> 00:18:52,038
The rocket, is not going you
to bring a happy childhood.

269
00:18:52,073--> 00:18:57,876
All of us have to grow, and...
and to take responsibilities.

270
00:18:57,911--> 00:19:02,964
He/she remembers during the dance of graduation of the
student I asked you for it ties the moon with me?

271
00:19:08,469--> 00:19:13,641
Well Charles, that was
a proposal to go out.

272
00:19:14,558--> 00:19:17,469
I still have to go walking.

273
00:19:19,271--> 00:19:21,440
We still didn't finish Charles.

274
00:19:21,481--> 00:19:23,150
Is that considered another section?

275
00:19:23,358--> 00:19:25,552
Did you already think about teacher to be?

276
00:19:25,652--> 00:19:27,746
That devils I will teach,
what not to do?

277
00:19:27,946--> 00:19:32,074
No! Charles you can inspire some
boy has to do what you are not able to.

278
00:19:32,109--> 00:19:34,285
But I can, and I will make Beth.

279
00:19:34,320--> 00:19:37,871
I hate to be the person r to say for you,
but you no and an astronaut Charles.

280
00:19:37,906--> 00:19:40,874
He/she didn't happen, and...
this everything well!

281
00:19:40,974--> 00:19:42,751
He/she knows, the military ones are not proud.

282
00:19:42,786--> 00:19:46,254
But we continued loving
you, and you didn't fail.

283
00:19:46,289--> 00:19:48,965
- And don't look in that way.
- I know.

284
00:19:49,000--> 00:19:51,551
Oh, my God,
you need help.

285
00:19:51,592--> 00:19:54,053
Yes, you this right one, I need
of help, I need to find Shepard...

286
00:19:54,088--> 00:19:55,888
Because I need to do
the release within 30 days.

287
00:19:55,923--> 00:19:58,557
Charles you need to find
a way of controlling his/her rage.

288
00:19:58,592--> 00:20:03,979
Or else he/she had shown in one
explosion, as a space rocket.

289
00:20:04,014--> 00:20:05,563
Charles Farmer!

290
00:20:05,598--> 00:20:09,067
Mrs. Gram, I came here for
to diffuse borrowed a child.

291
00:20:10,485--> 00:20:13,487
I need to use an engineer
like you there home.

292
00:20:13,522--> 00:20:16,198
Then, arrange yours
things and come with me.

293
00:20:16,233--> 00:20:20,160
Excuse me, but, we are
in the middle of the history class.

294
00:20:20,202--> 00:20:22,162
I sin excuses Mrs. Gram, but...

295
00:20:22,197--> 00:20:25,665
You just teach as writing
history, I will show as doing.

296
00:20:25,700--> 00:20:27,083
Have a good morning wanted.

297
00:20:29,002--> 00:20:30,670
- Where do we go?
- Where do we go?

298
00:20:30,705--> 00:20:32,088
House.

299
00:20:32,123--> 00:20:35,966
He/she marries, we know about that, but
does that seem the different road to be?

300
00:20:36,091--> 00:20:38,802
And a long road
it ties to arrive home.

301
00:20:38,837--> 00:20:41,888
Each one of you now is part
of the Space Program of Farmer.

302
00:20:41,923--> 00:20:44,474
If somebody sits down that
he or she are not fit...

303
00:20:44,509--> 00:20:48,386
In being in the Space Program of Farmer,
then he/she should speak his/her opinion now.

304
00:20:48,686--> 00:20:51,105
That means that us no
will we need to go for school?

305
00:20:51,140--> 00:20:52,481
Correct.

306
00:20:52,516--> 00:20:55,484
But, each guile us
we will set up a room.

307
00:20:55,519--> 00:20:58,112
And we will study the regular subjects,
then when you return to the school.

308
00:20:58,195--> 00:21:00,614
- You won't be late.
- Yes, gentleman.

309
00:21:00,549--> 00:21:02,115
Any question?

310
00:21:02,783--> 00:21:04,200
That and everything?

311
00:21:05,201--> 00:21:07,595
No dear, not yet.

312
00:21:09,580--> 00:21:12,708
- Which and the size of the rocket?
- And big.

313
00:21:12,743--> 00:21:14,919
Legal. Did you see then?

314
00:21:15,419--> 00:21:17,087
Of course I saw.

315
00:21:17,122--> 00:21:19,715
And you think
will he let to see me?

316
00:21:21,091--> 00:21:24,386
- It depends.
- It depends! Of the one what?

317
00:21:24,421--> 00:21:28,597
No and as if I will run
for the whole city saying "I saw him."

318
00:21:34,912--> 00:21:38,323
Smiling, you counted.

319
00:21:49,325--> 00:21:52,286
Ei Karl, did Phyllis come to play?

320
00:21:52,321--> 00:21:53,621
What this happening?

321
00:21:54,497--> 00:21:56,206
Why the children
they are not at the school?

322
00:21:56,241--> 00:22:00,127
I went ties the school, she talked
with me and I think finished.

323
00:22:00,162--> 00:22:01,503
Charles, you need to answer
my question;

324
00:22:01,628--> 00:22:02,921
What this happening?

325
00:22:03,421--> 00:22:04,798
Hi, Hal!

326
00:22:04,833--> 00:22:08,701
Do you want to do part of the program?
A type of Space Program.

327
00:22:09,802--> 00:22:13,931
Charles?!
Good-bye Phyllis.

328
00:22:13,966--> 00:22:16,308
I want you here
tomorrow of guile rs 5:00 hours.

329
00:22:16,343--> 00:22:18,519
Punctual, right?
Yes, Mr. I will go back home.

330
00:22:18,602--> 00:22:19,937
Right.

331
00:22:20,312--> 00:22:22,314
They will go back to the school tomorrow.

332
00:22:22,349--> 00:22:24,316
They are 3 weeks at least,
5 weeks at the most...

333
00:22:24,351--> 00:22:26,234
And they will go back to the school,
I promise for you.

334
00:22:26,269--> 00:22:27,902
Listen to me dear, you
he/she knows a lot as well as I know...

335
00:22:27,937--> 00:22:31,113
That they won't receive the type of
teaching in the school that you/they will receive here.

336
00:22:31,148--> 00:22:33,908
Nor they teach more
sciences in those schools.

337
00:22:33,943--> 00:22:35,910
He/she knows him/it that the teacher of
did sciences of Shepard say for him?

338
00:22:36,035--> 00:22:39,413

She said that sciences no and sexy.

What devils did happen with you?

342
00:22:46,871--> 00:22:48,338
They are five weeks at the most.

343
00:22:48,421--> 00:22:51,841
And they go back to the school,
do I promise, right?

344
00:23:07,021--> 00:23:10,817
<i> we Needed that information, they know
how many entrances do have in that property?</i>

345
00:23:10,852--> 00:23:12,735
<i> the farm has four entrances...</i>

346
00:23:12,770--> 00:23:17,439
<i> Alert 400,

<i> we Continued driving out

348
00:23:22,035--> 00:23:23,954
<i> Roger, we understood.</i>

00:23:23,989--> 00:23:28,041
<i> This below the area where this going,
you will have condic.es of seeing now.</i>

350
00:23:28,076--> 00:23:29,334
<i> Him this coming of the hill.</i>

00:23:29,369--> 00:23:30,543
<i> We have 7 suspects...</i>

352
00:23:30,626--> 00:23:33,422
<i> we have some suspect
done add at the place, Luiz Garcia?</i>

353
00:23:33,423--> 00:23:35,423
<i> Confirming that.</i>

354
00:23:40,844--> 00:23:45,557
<i> the farm this surrounded,
the area this holds.</i>

355
00:24:02,823--> 00:24:04,324
Do I can help them?

356
00:24:04,532--> 00:24:07,327
- Charles Farmer?
- Yes.

357
00:24:07,362--> 00:24:09,329
We are of FBI.

358
00:24:09,364--> 00:24:12,832
Mister, we are knowing
through electronic documents...

359
00:24:12,867--> 00:24:17,344
That you are seeking for fuel
of high quality, common in the use for...

360
00:24:18,462--> 00:24:20,047
To throw rockets.

361
00:24:20,082--> 00:24:21,340
You have knowledge...

362
00:24:21,348--> 00:24:24,050
That you don't have an illegal alien
working in his/her property?

363
00:24:24,085--> 00:24:27,345
Pepe Garcia. Jesus Garcia says.

364
00:24:27,380--> 00:24:29,138
If you cooperate...

365
00:24:29,173--> 00:24:32,768
We can find a way with that the
Mr. Garcia continues here with his/her family.

366
00:24:32,752--> 00:24:36,562
- We are going to the moon.
- That and really rotten.

367
00:24:36,645--> 00:24:38,439
We are doing
a generous proposal.

368
00:24:38,564--> 00:24:41,266
And where this going that man?

369
00:24:43,235--> 00:24:45,236
It is very simple Mr. Farmer...

370
00:24:45,271--> 00:24:48,865
It is illegal to try to get that type
of fuel for private use.

371
00:24:48,900--> 00:24:51,075
Any one that try acquire
that type of fuel...

372
00:24:51,159--> 00:24:52,576
He/she has to be considered
as a threat.

373
00:24:52,611--> 00:24:54,370
That and a true agreement.

374
00:24:54,405--> 00:24:55,871
I am not threat.

375
00:24:55,906--> 00:24:58,373
Well, like us we will know that you
no this building an ogiva, bomb.

376
00:24:58,408--> 00:24:59,875
Because I am not in war.

377
00:25:00,375--> 00:25:03,753
We only want you to know that
his/her small rocket won't fly...

378
00:25:03,788--> 00:25:06,548
While we are doing
this investigation.

379
00:25:06,583--> 00:25:07,882
Yes.

380
00:25:23,355--> 00:25:25,482
I filled out that form of FAA...

381
00:25:25,565--> 00:25:28,451
Six months ago showing
my flight plans...

382
00:25:28,486--> 00:25:32,271
Ilustrac.es of the ship, never saw
thing that I could not throw.

383
00:25:32,306--> 00:25:35,258
I thought you were not speaking serialize,
therefore I didn't pay any attention.

384
00:25:35,293--> 00:25:37,368
How can they stop now?

385
00:25:37,403--> 00:25:38,660
Jesus, Farmer.

386
00:25:38,695--> 00:25:42,664
With that patriotic action,
they distorted the laws so much.

387
00:25:42,699--> 00:25:44,791
They can do what want...

388
00:25:44,826--> 00:25:48,378
Since they think you this
putting in risk the National security.

389
00:25:48,413--> 00:25:50,088
What do you want that me knife?

390
00:25:50,123--> 00:25:53,883
Confuse a little more, it doesn't exist
laws enough for you to do that?

391
00:25:53,918--> 00:25:57,469
Everything well, they said
what will make some acusac.es?

392
00:25:57,504--> 00:26:01,264
I don't know, no exactly, them
they said that I am under investigation.

393
00:26:01,299--> 00:26:04,976
That means that they will be
all watching their movements.

394
00:26:08,062--> 00:26:13,275
I have a friend, that maybe knife,
him and partner of a great firm.

395
00:26:13,484--> 00:26:16,278
Specialized in cases as that.

396
00:26:16,313--> 00:26:18,864
It is worthwhile to try.

397
00:26:18,899--> 00:26:21,575
Maybe he can
to move with the situation,

398
00:26:21,610--> 00:26:24,494
he owes me a favor,
I won't cost me a cent.

399
00:26:24,529--> 00:26:27,080
Get ready, we are passing.

400
00:26:27,872--> 00:26:30,666
To go for the space,
no and more I need NASA.

401
00:26:30,701--> 00:26:35,004
That and real here in the
the space cowboy's ranch.

402
00:26:35,039--> 00:26:38,382
Here behind me, in that
farm has a rocket.

403
00:26:38,674--> 00:26:42,969
A rocket that Charles Farmer
he/she wants to throw in the space.

404
00:26:43,004--> 00:26:46,306
<i> after forming in Merrill welder
making the second degree.</i>

405
00:26:46,341--> 00:26:48,808
<i> He continued his/her education
in the university of Texas...</i>

406
00:26:48,843--> 00:26:52,303
<i> Receiving the diploma
for space engineering.</i>

407
00:26:52,438--> 00:26:55,606
<i> Soon soon afterwards, him Charles Farmer
he/she enrolled in the aerial fork.</i>

408
00:26:55,689--> 00:26:57,983
<i> Where he developed
their abilities as pilot...</i>

409
00:26:58,018--> 00:27:00,694
<i> Flying certain avi.es,
as F-4 Phantom.</i>

410
00:27:00,729--> 00:27:04,614
<i> THE fogueteiro Charles Farmer was in
fact to be an astronaut.</i>

411
00:27:04,698--> 00:27:07,283
<i> before being released by the military ones.</i>

412
00:27:07,318--> 00:27:08,010
Hello.

413
00:27:08,011--> 00:27:08,811
<i> Ei, what this happening?</i>

414
00:27:08,945--> 00:27:11,787
Saint cows face, you not
he/she told me that his/her friend and of CNN.

415
00:27:11,822--> 00:27:14,290
<i> THE ONE that he said, he said
that he/she angers to hug the cause Farmer.</i>

416
00:27:14,498--> 00:27:16,817
Invite him, and for his/her protection.

417
00:27:16,852--> 00:27:18,920
<i> - You want him/it him on his/her side Farmer.</i>

418
00:27:18,921--> 00:27:20,621
- Hum.

419
00:27:21,004--> 00:27:22,589
He built the rocket...

420
00:27:22,624--> 00:27:24,716
I am sure that he built
the release platform.

421
00:27:24,751--> 00:27:25,717
Truth?

422
00:27:25,752--> 00:27:27,385
Yes, you don't think that crazy one
he/she gets to build the rocket...

423
00:27:27,420--> 00:27:29,303
And to forget of the platform.

424
00:27:29,345--> 00:27:31,889
Only if he never drifted in throw-lo.

425
00:27:31,924--> 00:27:34,016
Then, why are we here?

426
00:27:34,051--> 00:27:37,019
Because if we are not
hearing any release.

427
00:27:37,811--> 00:27:39,897
We will be with face of stupid.

428
00:27:40,522--> 00:27:43,608
And if he does, and we to listen?

429
00:27:43,808--> 00:27:46,694
We will continue with face of stupid.

430
00:27:47,111--> 00:27:51,490
- Here this him!
- Be careful! Be careful!

431
00:27:59,122--> 00:28:03,293
Possibly, if you have one
he/she forms of doing the questions one per time...

432
00:28:03,328--> 00:28:05,628
I will try answer-wools
with the best of my abilities.

433
00:28:05,663--> 00:28:09,215
And important for you that the people
do know the importance of the space trip?

434
00:28:09,298--> 00:28:11,217
I will put for you in that way:

435
00:28:11,252--> 00:28:13,219
He/she has a lot of people in that world
that you/they still believe that Michael Jackson...

436
00:28:13,254--> 00:28:15,729
He/she had the first wash
cerebral in the moon.

437
00:28:15,804--> 00:28:18,307
Mr. Farmer when you
does he/she intend to throw his/her rocket?

438
00:28:18,342--> 00:28:19,433
Therefore.

439
00:28:19,468--> 00:28:21,810
Mr. Farmer why you
this making that?

440
00:28:22,727--> 00:28:24,804
It has always been my dream.

441
00:28:25,939--> 00:28:27,440
The Americano Charles Farmer.

442
00:28:27,475--> 00:28:30,234
- Charles Farmer.
- Charles Farmer.

443
00:28:30,269--> 00:28:31,235
Charles Farmer.

444
00:28:31,270--> 00:28:33,904
Denominated of cowboy of the space.

445
00:28:33,939--> 00:28:37,908
The rocket and enormous, really big.

446
00:28:38,117--> 00:28:42,120
He became an astronaut
crazy, if they ask me.

447
00:28:42,821--> 00:28:44,721
CARLES FARMER LANÇAMENTO
Probabilities
60 to 1

448
00:28:44,739--> 00:28:47,224

- My wife...

449
00:28:48,334--> 00:28:50,044
She wants an autograph.

450
00:28:50,128--> 00:28:50,920
Listen that:

00:28:50,955--> 00:28:54,548
He/she has a guy in Texas, building him/it
his/her own rocket in his/her back yard.

452
00:28:54,583--> 00:28:58,052
That guy intends
to rush in orbit.

453
00:28:59,219--> 00:29:02,931
That and my question: It would not be easy
just to say wanted... I want the divorce.

454
00:29:02,966--> 00:29:04,132
Right.

455
00:29:06,151--> 00:29:08,919
That no and very funny.

456
00:29:09,145--> 00:29:11,355
He/she seems that really
we have today a beautiful day.

<i> the highest temperature will be

458
00:29:13,941--> 00:29:15,317
Good morning Hal.

459
00:29:15,442--> 00:29:19,029
<i> AND looking at the rocket, the time this
very good in almost the whole Country.</i>

460
00:29:19,064--> 00:29:21,656
That and known as;
the cemetery of the rockets.

461
00:29:21,691--> 00:29:25,327
Charles Farmer can get all the
support that needs in places as that.

462
00:29:25,362--> 00:29:29,238
One want to build a rocket,
that and the place to begin.

463
00:29:31,958--> 00:29:35,461
<i> THE rocket of Farmer this
in the deposit that you see below.</i>

464
00:29:35,544--> 00:29:39,131
<i> Due the great number of curious,

<i> does He get?</i>

468
00:29:46,881--> 00:29:50,766
<i> of course he gets.
He angers to do. That and the one that he says.</i>

469
00:29:50,850--> 00:29:52,852
<i> he/she Has many FAA regulations...</i>

<i> Pará that an astronaut

472
00:29:58,684--> 00:30:01,068
<i> First he has to have the approval of the
Federal Aviation Administration "FAA" </i>

473
00:30:01,103--> 00:30:02,569
<i> An audience was marked.</i>

474
00:30:02,669--> 00:30:05,447
<i> there is how long the government not
does he/she allow you to throw his/her rocket?</i>

475

That and exactly the one that us no
we wanted that happened.

479
00:30:13,581--> 00:30:16,248
We go, we have to investigate
that face, find something.

480
00:30:16,283--> 00:30:18,667
We have to remove that cowboy
space of the clouds.

481
00:30:18,702--> 00:30:21,169
Get ready boys,
we are going to Texas.

482
00:30:21,204--> 00:30:23,672
Astronaut Farmer looks for
a second chance.

483
00:30:23,755--> 00:30:26,674
Well, a man deserves
a second chance.

484
00:30:27,175--> 00:30:29,552
More presents.

485
00:30:29,844--> 00:30:31,846
And the last.

486
00:30:33,264--> 00:30:35,558
Stanley...

487
00:30:35,593--> 00:30:38,560
Why don't you change the newspaper
of the cage of the dear hamster?

488
00:30:38,590--> 00:30:40,562
Wait one moment,
I would like to see that.

489
00:30:40,597--> 00:30:43,857
- We go, let to give me a glance.
- Don't worry with everything that reads wanted.

490
00:30:43,892--> 00:30:45,275
Well, I still want to read that.

491
00:30:45,358--> 00:30:49,362
It doesn't owe if it worries with that,
you don't get to read Spanish.

492
00:30:51,656--> 00:30:55,367
His/her father is right! You owe
to change the newspaper of the cage of the hamster.

493
00:30:55,402--> 00:30:56,368
Right.

494
00:30:56,403--> 00:30:58,579
They called us of fanatic.

495
00:30:58,614--> 00:31:00,872
They said that we are as one
ranch of mad or something similar.

496
00:31:00,972--> 00:31:01,723
I know.

497
00:31:01,865--> 00:31:03,875
They think our family
they are a group of space cadets.

498
00:31:03,975--> 00:31:04,876
I know, I know.

499
00:31:04,959--> 00:31:07,879
- How can they make that?
- Because I can go to the space.

500
00:31:07,962--> 00:31:10,081
We are a normal family.

501
00:31:10,281--> 00:31:12,675
We needed to say for
all that that no and truth.

502
00:31:12,710--> 00:31:15,261
Wanted needed only

00:31:24,964--> 00:31:29,164
<i> I am tired to go giving turns.</i>

506
00:31:30,165--> 00:31:31,865
<i> I play that dream of giving turns...</i>

507
00:31:32,165--> 00:31:34,365

<i> But if him some time

515
00:33:00,772--> 00:33:02,872
Therefore.

516
00:33:02,973--> 00:33:07,273
<i>... AND whenever the tears begin...</i>

517
00:33:07,574--> 00:33:15,774

518
00:33:17,074--> 00:33:21,574
Excuse me, I want to speak
with you on the trip.

519
00:33:22,775--> 00:33:23,975
Two entrances.

520
00:33:23,976--> 00:33:26,976
No Mr. I want to say;

521
00:33:27,077--> 00:33:28,777
How much will cost me?

00:33:28,778--> 00:33:31,278
We can rent
for US$500 a week.

523
00:33:32,179--> 00:33:34,079
We can talk
to close the business?

524
00:33:34,080--> 00:33:35,480
- Clear.
- Yes.

525
00:33:35,481--> 00:33:37,881
Absolutely,
will you be for here?

526
00:33:37,882--> 00:33:39,682
Yes, I am here.

527
00:34:04,283--> 00:34:06,483
Will Matheson!

528
00:34:15,584--> 00:34:20,784
La out in the space, you receive,
a perspective totally different.

529
00:34:20,785--> 00:34:22,585
Different every time.

530
00:34:22,586--> 00:34:26,786
Different perspective of the earth,
perspective of you even.

531
00:34:27,187--> 00:34:29,687
Every time and completely different.

532
00:34:29,688--> 00:34:34,688
He/she suggests...
and just beautiful, all this and...

533
00:34:35,189--> 00:34:36,389
Beautiful.

534
00:34:37,190--> 00:34:41,490
You see the world and he/she notices
where all of us are,

535
00:34:42,291--> 00:34:46,191
The life changes,
definitively the life changes.

536
00:34:47,092--> 00:34:50,192
- That chicken this very good Audrey.
- Thank you!

537
00:34:50,193--> 00:34:53,493
This to do to begin me r to cry.

538
00:34:54,594--> 00:34:59,694
This well, the last
mission was in... Denver.

539
00:34:59,695--> 00:35:02,595
Audie, where is it?

540
00:35:02,596--> 00:35:07,196
The name of the espaconave calls himself
Crow Master Of the Law.

541
00:35:07,197--> 00:35:09,397
We don't have name
for our rocket.

542
00:35:09,398--> 00:35:10,898
You don't have!

543
00:35:11,599--> 00:35:13,499
You don't have name for
his/her rocket Farmer?

544
00:35:13,500--> 00:35:16,000
Well, we didn't arrive in that part still.

545
00:35:16,001--> 00:35:18,901
We should think about some
names, don't you find?

546
00:35:19,002--> 00:35:20,402
Sunshine?

547
00:35:21,003--> 00:35:22,603
Liquors

548
00:35:22,604--> 00:35:24,304
Liquors?

549
00:35:26,505--> 00:35:29,605
Who does certain, vote for in Liquors?

550
00:35:31,606--> 00:35:33,006
Right.

551
00:35:33,007--> 00:35:37,307
Stanley submitted
the name Rocken Rocket.

552
00:35:37,308--> 00:35:40,708
- Who votes for in Rocken Rocket?
- I like that.

553
00:35:41,509--> 00:35:44,509
You this playing, this voting for in
all of the names that appear tie now.

554
00:35:44,510--> 00:35:46,410
I am taking r so serialize
like you my friend.

555
00:35:46,411--> 00:35:47,411
Right.

556
00:35:47,412--> 00:35:52,212
Now, Shepard already decided how he/she had said
previously, do you want to change of name?

557
00:35:52,213--> 00:35:53,313
Yes, yes I want to change the name...

558
00:35:53,514--> 00:35:56,214
I only want to think a little more,
I am not sure of what I want.

559
00:35:56,215--> 00:35:57,215
Right.

560
00:35:57,216--> 00:36:00,316
Pepe, choose a name.

561
00:36:12,017--> 00:36:13,817
The Other Woman.

562
00:36:14,318--> 00:36:15,618
What does that mean?

563
00:36:15,719--> 00:36:18,519
Well, it won't be the name
of the rocket, don't worry.

564
00:36:18,520--> 00:36:20,920
The one that that means, because
us whole we have to vote for.

565
00:36:20,921--> 00:36:24,121
He/she means, "THE Other Woman", wanted.

566
00:36:24,622--> 00:36:30,022
No! you won't vote for in that name.

567
00:36:31,323--> 00:36:36,323
I think we owed
to go outside and to see THE Other Woman.

568
00:36:54,024--> 00:36:58,124
Filho of the prostitute Farmer!

569
00:37:02,525--> 00:37:07,425
Uau!... Did you build that thing?

570
00:37:07,626--> 00:37:09,426
I screw in for screw.

571
00:37:09,927--> 00:37:13,127
That and an engineering would be!

572
00:37:13,928--> 00:37:17,428
You don't think they would bring you
it ties here if it went a rocket mixuruca,

573
00:37:17,429--> 00:37:19,129
Do you find?

574
00:37:19,130--> 00:37:21,830
Brilliant.

575
00:37:22,731--> 00:37:27,031
- You this being serializes with that?
- Absolutely.

576
00:37:35,132--> 00:37:39,232
Look here beautiful.

577
00:37:41,433--> 00:37:44,833
"What had happened...

578
00:37:45,634--> 00:37:49,534
If the rocket no
to get to be thrown?"

579
00:37:49,535--> 00:37:54,135
And they will stop doing
it cribs here when they know...

580
00:37:54,536--> 00:37:57,536
What will happen he/she wanted?

581
00:37:58,637--> 00:38:01,837
Well, and for that that
he needs our support.

582
00:38:01,938--> 00:38:05,238
Guardi.es
when all leave.

583
00:38:07,139--> 00:38:09,639
That no and I need.

584
00:38:10,340--> 00:38:14,240
No, that and the life.

585
00:38:34,841--> 00:38:37,441
What do you find?

586
00:38:41,142--> 00:38:45,942
I think will be a sad day of
shit here in Farmville...

587
00:38:46,043--> 00:38:48,943
When he/she sees all his/her work
here to be transformed in garbage.

588
00:38:48,944--> 00:38:52,444
I think that.
What do you think?

589
00:38:55,745--> 00:38:59,145
You think they go
does to let you to go tie the space?

590
00:38:59,746--> 00:39:01,346
A civilian?

591
00:39:01,747--> 00:39:06,347
They don't leave civilians to go it ties the space,
astronauts are going to the space.

592
00:39:06,348--> 00:39:10,548
Professional astronauts, that are
to resist press.es...

593
00:39:10,649--> 00:39:14,049
And the forks, and the emotional stress.

594
00:39:14,150--> 00:39:16,150
Of leaving his/her family back.

595
00:39:16,251--> 00:39:20,151
I made an agreement with my father, Dog,
and for that that I will make that.

596
00:39:20,152--> 00:39:23,052
- He/she doesn't need to be like this.
- My family needs me.

597
00:39:23,053--> 00:39:27,953
But...
if that and a test, you failed.

598
00:39:28,654--> 00:39:30,854
The one that you think
NASA this thinking?

599
00:39:30,855--> 00:39:32,455
That those boys
they will put you in the space,

600
00:39:32,556--> 00:39:34,656
the father dies, he decides that for one
doesn't moment want to return home?

601
00:39:34,657--> 00:39:37,557
I thought a person existed in the
face of the earth that maybe understood that,

602
00:39:37,558--> 00:39:39,458
that person and you.

603
00:39:39,459--> 00:39:43,159
Me really,
I didn't really wait for that.

604
00:39:48,160--> 00:39:52,160
It is been I tell you that I will be able to
to get a chance for you?

605
00:39:52,961--> 00:39:55,961
I say that I don't want that you
me of a ride in the space bus.

606
00:39:56,062--> 00:39:58,762
Forget that, forget
the ride in the bus space, right?

607
00:39:58,763--> 00:40:00,463
Do forget the rocket, right?

608
00:40:00,564--> 00:40:02,864
You forget the rocket that you put
a lot of hard work to build.

609
00:40:02,865--> 00:40:06,465
Remove those people of his/her glue, remove
those idiots with the cameras of here.

610
00:40:06,566--> 00:40:11,866
And you are going to the space,
in the correct way, way holds.

611
00:40:13,567--> 00:40:15,667
You think me
won't I get, right?

612
00:40:15,768--> 00:40:17,768
Forget that, that and because of the money.

613
00:40:17,769--> 00:40:20,369
Nor the power NASA and important,
milh.es of dollars.

614
00:40:20,370--> 00:40:23,670
US$ 60.2 bilh.es,
just for the budget of that year.

615
00:40:23,771--> 00:40:25,871
- For the one what?
- For the one what? Who does care he/she so that?

616
00:40:25,872--> 00:40:27,572
For any thing that they want.

617
00:40:27,573--> 00:40:30,073
They won't let you to fly
with his/her alone private ship,

618
00:40:30,074--> 00:40:32,574
arising for the space and to try to go down.

619
00:40:32,575--> 00:40:36,575
That will do they to seem stupid.
Do you think that will really happen?

620
00:40:38,576--> 00:40:41,976
Don't answer me now, I want
that you don't answer me right now.

621
00:40:41,977--> 00:40:44,777
I want you to think r respect.

622
00:40:50,378--> 00:40:52,278
Miss Rocket-tell.

623
00:40:55,479--> 00:40:58,379
It will be if Charles Farmer will have
permission to throw his/her rocket?

624
00:40:58,380--> 00:40:59,880
Therefore we are today here.

625
00:40:59,881--> 00:41:04,481
FAA, FBI, CIA, department
of energy, and military members.

626
00:41:04,582--> 00:41:07,282
All are here personal.
What do you think of all this?

627
00:41:07,283--> 00:41:09,383
He/she seems that we have all
the senses of Venus, humm?

628
00:41:09,384--> 00:41:13,484
No and allowed cameras, or him/it
he/she presses there inside during the audience.

629
00:41:43,485--> 00:41:46,485
We are gathered here,
to analyze an application...

630
00:41:46,486--> 00:41:49,086
For the release of a spaceship.

631
00:41:49,087--> 00:41:53,087
They will be done vary questions, answer
please with the best of his/her knowledge?

632
00:41:53,188--> 00:41:54,088
Yes gentleman.

633
00:41:54,089--> 00:41:57,289
We began with his/her plan
of flight, that you submitted.

634
00:41:57,290--> 00:42:00,590
His/her plan and to do a turn
he/she completes for the orbit of the earth.

635
00:42:00,691--> 00:42:05,491
Once ended, the capsule
anger to reenter in the atmosphere.

636
00:42:05,492--> 00:42:10,892
- Does he/she seem easy, simple?
- Yes gentleman.

637
00:42:11,493--> 00:42:13,493
Well, but no and.

638
00:42:14,394--> 00:42:18,094
I submit that that and an opinion
of the gentleman, but no a fact.

639
00:42:18,095--> 00:42:19,995
You this aware one that that
no and a tribunal of justice?

640
00:42:19,996--> 00:42:22,996
I am, but I won't be
sat down here as pot of a plant.

641
00:42:22,997--> 00:42:24,597
I hope not.

642
00:42:25,098--> 00:42:26,798
I believe as boss of FAA,

643
00:42:26,999--> 00:42:29,799
my opinion can have
importance in the subject space flight.

644
00:42:29,800--> 00:42:30,800
Yes gentleman.

645
00:42:30,801--> 00:42:34,001
You based his/her project,
in the rocket Herras, yes?

646
00:42:34,002--> 00:42:35,302
Yes gentleman.

647
00:42:35,303--> 00:42:39,803
You know that Herras comes from a project
of construction of a ballistic missile?

648
00:42:39,804--> 00:42:40,504
Yes gentleman.

649
00:42:40,605--> 00:42:43,805
Then, basically you built
a missile in his/her barn?

650
00:42:43,806--> 00:42:45,206
That and incorrect.

651
00:42:45,207--> 00:42:48,107
Will Bigan of the CO.

652
00:42:48,108--> 00:42:50,408
Like us we will know that
you no this building...

653
00:42:50,509--> 00:42:53,609
"WMD" "Weapon of Mass Destruction?"

654
00:42:54,310--> 00:42:58,510
Well, because if I was building
a Weapon of Destruction in Mass...

655
00:42:58,611--> 00:43:01,611
You would not have condic.es of finding.

656
00:43:02,912--> 00:43:04,912
Very funny Mr. Farmer.

657
00:43:05,013--> 00:43:07,313
That no and truth.

658
00:43:08,614--> 00:43:11,814
Here this, thank you for waiting.

659
00:43:14,315--> 00:43:16,815
Hi! Thank you for waiting.
Can he/she make his/her request?

660
00:43:16,816--> 00:43:19,316
Audrey "Audie" Farmer?
The astronaut's wife.

661
00:43:19,317--> 00:43:20,617
Yes lady,
in what I do can help her?

662
00:43:20,818--> 00:43:24,318
Gretchen Boyd, of the entity
of protection rs children.

663
00:43:24,319--> 00:43:26,719
Please want to sit down.

664
00:43:27,920--> 00:43:29,120
No thank you.

665
00:43:29,221--> 00:43:35,421
Mrs. Farmer, became aware that
their children as well as you also.

666
00:43:35,622--> 00:43:37,922
Maybe be in wrong arms.

667
00:43:40,023--> 00:43:41,423
How like this?

668
00:43:41,424--> 00:43:46,324
His/her husband has been doing literally
brainwashing in you and their children.

669
00:43:46,325--> 00:43:48,225
He removed them of the school.

670
00:43:48,226--> 00:43:53,926
And he isolated the whole family of
any another influences expresses.

671
00:43:56,727--> 00:43:59,927
This in your hour to take
the control of his/her family...

672
00:43:59,928--> 00:44:03,428
Before somebody knife for you.

673
00:44:05,629--> 00:44:08,729
Who and his/her responsible
for the control of the mission?

674
00:44:08,830--> 00:44:10,430
Shepard Farmer, my son.

675
00:44:10,431--> 00:44:12,231
Does he have some experiences?

676
00:44:12,232--> 00:44:13,832
Of course yes, 15 years.

677
00:44:13,833--> 00:44:15,833
That and a joke for you Mr. Farmer?

678
00:44:15,834--> 00:44:18,934
15 years of age, he/she will be the boss
of control of his/her mission?

679
00:44:19,035--> 00:44:22,135
Him perfectly capable of
to throw the own father to the space,

680
00:44:22,136--> 00:44:24,136
Don't underestimate him/it that the
my son and capable to do.

681
00:44:24,137--> 00:44:25,737
We go there, he has 15 years of age.

682
00:44:25,738--> 00:44:28,538
He also had one
evaluation done recently.

683
00:44:28,539--> 00:44:33,039
- For the Dr. Beth Goode.
- Nurse Goode?

684
00:44:33,040--> 00:44:35,940
I received vary informac.es of the Dr.

685
00:44:35,941--> 00:44:42,641
She said that the Mr. Farmer this
with rage, unstable, hallucinated.

686
00:44:42,642--> 00:44:46,342
And that his/her mental and questionable health.

687
00:44:46,343--> 00:44:50,343
Charles, his/her father committed
suicide, that and correct?

688
00:44:53,944--> 00:44:56,644
Don't go for that road Colonel.

689
00:45:08,345--> 00:45:11,845
I can tell you right now,
the one that you built here and...

690
00:45:12,146--> 00:45:14,346
An alone passage of
departure for the life after the death.

691
00:45:14,347--> 00:45:17,747
The establishment that
the Mr. Farmer built to go to the space.

692
00:45:17,748--> 00:45:20,148
The government from the United States has
a space program Mr. Farmer...

693
00:45:20,149--> 00:45:23,049
Why didn't we just leave
that for the professionals?

694
00:45:23,050--> 00:45:26,350
In 1960 they began the space race.

695
00:45:26,351--> 00:45:29,951
When we arrived in
1969 we were in the moon.

696
00:45:30,552--> 00:45:34,252
And in that I tan period of time,
look what we did.

697
00:45:34,253--> 00:45:38,853
In my opinion, I believe, if some
another country wants to go r moon and to live there.

698
00:45:38,954--> 00:45:41,154
We will enter in war against him.

699
00:45:41,155--> 00:45:43,855
Because we thought the moon and ours.

700
00:45:44,556--> 00:45:46,556
But no and!

701
00:45:47,557--> 00:45:50,557
In the same way that no and of his/her right.

702
00:45:50,558--> 00:45:53,458
To tell me when I can
or not to rush to the space.

703
00:45:53,459--> 00:45:55,159
Mr. Farmer we have laws!

704
00:45:55,160--> 00:45:57,660
I know that we have laws,
we have all of the types of laws.

705
00:45:57,661--> 00:46:00,561
We have more laws than they tell us the one that not
we can do than any other thing.

706
00:46:00,562--> 00:46:03,662
We have laws for
to protect us of other laws.

707
00:46:03,663--> 00:46:05,463
If to do comments as that
you won't be helping.

708
00:46:05,464--> 00:46:09,464
Listen, you are speaking there is guile
he/she completes, let to speak to me for one moment.

709
00:46:09,865--> 00:46:11,465
Right?

710
00:46:11,966--> 00:46:14,166
I won't be long.

711
00:46:16,667--> 00:46:17,867
See, when I was child,

712
00:46:17,868--> 00:46:22,568
tell me that me
it could be everything to want to be.

713
00:46:23,269--> 00:46:25,769
He/she doesn't import him/it that.

714
00:46:27,270--> 00:46:32,270
It is maybe I am insane, I don't know,
but, I still believe in that.

715
00:46:32,271--> 00:46:34,871
I believe of all my heart.

716
00:46:38,272--> 00:46:40,472
In some part of the road...

717
00:46:40,873--> 00:46:46,573
We stopped believing that
we can make any thing.

718
00:46:47,374--> 00:46:51,774
And if we don't have ours
dreams, we have anything!

719
00:46:55,675--> 00:46:59,575
We will inform him/it of our decision.

720
00:47:09,776--> 00:47:11,576
I will save his/her life.

721
00:47:12,877--> 00:47:16,477
I will tell you something, that nobody
more of here anger to say for you.

722
00:47:16,478--> 00:47:18,478
Right now the military forks of the USA...

723
00:47:18,479--> 00:47:20,379
He/she has to can more of fork
pointed for his/her ranch...

724
00:47:20,579--> 00:47:22,979
That if you decide to throw...

725
00:47:22,980--> 00:47:28,180
In seconds their remains will be
dispersed for five States.

726
00:47:30,681--> 00:47:32,681
That and a threat?

727
00:47:32,682--> 00:47:36,782
No!... You and the threat.

728
00:47:47,183--> 00:47:49,483
Don't believe in a word
of the one that him Farmer said.

729
00:47:49,984--> 00:47:52,784
Nobody will throw a missile against you.

730
00:47:52,785--> 00:47:56,085
They don't have laws to stop, for
that they are wanting to be frightened.

731
00:47:56,086--> 00:47:58,086
I don't know.

732
00:47:59,087--> 00:48:04,287
Actually them healthy very good
in murdering people that he/she has brains.

733
00:48:13,888--> 00:48:15,988
Small rocket.

734
00:48:24,289--> 00:48:26,989
Now I think
that and everything Mrs. Farmer.

735
00:48:26,990--> 00:48:29,090
Thank you.

736
00:48:33,591--> 00:48:36,891
- Then and truth?
- What?

737
00:48:36,892--> 00:48:39,492
To receive US$1 million for your history?

738
00:48:39,493--> 00:48:41,593
No Vanessa, that no and truth.

739
00:48:41,594--> 00:48:43,594
I won't be counting of the
US$1 million, I will keep secret.

740
00:48:43,595--> 00:48:45,795
Vanessa! Hand and truth.

741
00:48:46,496--> 00:48:51,096
- The total and US$86,05
- Excuse me.

742
00:48:51,197--> 00:48:53,097

743
00:48:56,098--> 00:48:57,898
I pay off Insufficient.

744
00:49:01,599--> 00:49:03,599
Care with their fingers.

745
00:49:04,000--> 00:49:07,800
Excuse me Mrs. Farmer but
his/her card was reproven.

746
00:49:07,801--> 00:49:11,201
- Ah, yes.
- You would like to try...

747
00:49:12,702--> 00:49:14,602
You could maintain all this here...

748
00:49:14,803--> 00:49:19,203
And I will return, it will only delay one
little, right? We are going girls, we go.

749
00:49:47,104--> 00:49:53,004
I am going to the moon...
and I will take that brick.

750
00:50:01,105--> 00:50:04,005
Children, they can give me one moment
of privacy with his/her mother.

751
00:50:04,006--> 00:50:06,706
No! That has already been
private per time enough.

752
00:50:06,707--> 00:50:10,407
You can lie for me the time that
he/she wants Charles, but it doesn't lie for them.

753
00:50:11,308--> 00:50:13,208
Say for them...

754
00:50:13,409--> 00:50:17,009
Say for them that we maybe don't have
plus the house of here there are some weeks.

755
00:50:17,010--> 00:50:18,410
Do stop with that Audie, right?
Please.

756
00:50:18,411--> 00:50:20,311
- No, you that stops with that.
- Please to that!

757
00:50:20,312--> 00:50:21,812
Which was his/her plan?
What did you plan in doing?

758
00:50:21,813--> 00:50:23,113
To disappear of that earth...

759
00:50:23,114--> 00:50:26,914
And to leave us here to work with the
consequences, without money, without anything!

760
00:50:27,115--> 00:50:28,215
Without money for the food?!

761
00:50:28,416--> 00:50:30,816
All this for food!

762
00:50:32,517--> 00:50:33,917
Excuse me.

763
00:50:37,218--> 00:50:39,718
Had not food remained?
and that what you thought?

764
00:50:39,719--> 00:50:40,619
Children...

765
00:50:40,620--> 00:50:44,720
You don't have that if they worry with
anything because we have plenty of food, right?

766
00:50:44,721--> 00:50:50,821
Be r put, right. Cheese, salami,
white hotdog, peanut paste!

767
00:50:50,822--> 00:50:52,422
- Stop!
- All have the types of food!

768
00:50:52,423--> 00:50:55,523
Shepard removes the children
of here right now!

769
00:50:59,424--> 00:51:02,824
Do you want to play that?!
Does he/she want to throw something in me Audie?!

770
00:51:02,825--> 00:51:04,225
And something what you want to do?!

771
00:51:04,226--> 00:51:07,226
- Go ahead!
- Do you want flying hotdogs?

772
00:51:07,327--> 00:51:10,327
You never again accuse me
in front of the children!

773
00:51:10,328--> 00:51:11,228
Do you understand me?!

774
00:51:11,229--> 00:51:14,629
You had not taken care of
us when we don't have a home.

775
00:51:14,630--> 00:51:17,130
You have to stay safe r!

776
00:51:17,131--> 00:51:22,531
That dream that all of us shared
a person, and that person and you have!

777
00:51:22,832--> 00:51:27,332
You will lose everything Charles!
Besides his/her family!

778
00:51:40,433--> 00:51:44,533
And I need to clean that kitchen.

779
00:51:47,734--> 00:51:50,334
Excuse me for that.

780
00:52:00,535--> 00:52:03,735
Audrey...

781
00:52:06,836--> 00:52:11,236
I love you and the children
plus than everything in that world.

782
00:52:11,237--> 00:52:14,637
But if I give up the
that I believe now.

783
00:52:17,438--> 00:52:22,438
Me... I will be making any well.

784
00:52:26,339--> 00:52:28,839
I always believed.

785
00:52:30,740--> 00:52:33,940
I only am not more sure.

786
00:53:01,441--> 00:53:04,941
Certain, here this.

787
00:53:06,442--> 00:53:08,742
- This holding the mother's bag?
- Yes mother.

788
00:53:08,743--> 00:53:10,443
Audie?

789
00:53:12,244--> 00:53:14,644
Audie, you don't need to go.

790
00:53:15,545--> 00:53:18,145
And Sunday, we go there is church.

791
00:53:19,646--> 00:53:23,546
I hope now to learn something on
pardon, because we will need.

792
00:53:23,547--> 00:53:25,147
We are going Audie no knife that.

793
00:53:25,148--> 00:53:28,248
No Charles, they idolize you.

794
00:53:28,249--> 00:53:30,849
They enter, if I am not better, then...

795
00:53:30,850--> 00:53:34,350
I call you of bundao,
for lying for us.

796
00:53:35,351--> 00:53:38,751
I have to find one
it sorts things out of you to forgive.

797
00:53:39,952--> 00:53:41,752
And them also.

798
00:53:54,753--> 00:53:56,853
Me Ihe story a thing.

799
00:53:58,654--> 00:54:02,454
You and a fabulous father.

800
00:54:02,755--> 00:54:05,255
And why Farmer do you know?

801
00:54:05,256--> 00:54:10,356
That face, doesn't get to gather
his family for dinner.

802
00:54:11,557--> 00:54:18,357
But you...
he/she has his/her family... dreaming committee.

803
00:54:19,058--> 00:54:22,258
Fabulous, of great importance.

804
00:54:22,259--> 00:54:25,059
Really great thing.

805
00:54:32,060--> 00:54:37,060
All have to burn a lot
fuel running the cars, does he/she know?

806
00:54:37,961--> 00:54:41,361
Yes, but pursuing cars
in great circles as that...

807
00:54:41,562--> 00:54:45,362
And necessary of a lot of publicity.

808
00:54:49,062--> 00:54:52,162
The fact on the subject and Doug,
if you sponsor my rocket.

809
00:54:52,163--> 00:54:55,863
He/she will increase their sales,
that exists for a reason.

810
00:54:55,864--> 00:54:57,464
Haul of the more you will have the attention...

811
00:54:57,465--> 00:55:00,865
That usually you had not received
for the conventional methods, you know.

812
00:55:00,866--> 00:55:03,766
I have a letter of the
company COKE.

813
00:55:03,767--> 00:55:05,467
I hope they appear
for here well early.

814
00:55:05,468--> 00:55:08,268
They can put here.

815
00:55:08,269--> 00:55:12,469
But, before they come and...
everything paints of red.

816
00:55:12,470--> 00:55:14,070
You have his/her choice.

817
00:55:14,071--> 00:55:17,771
Do look at that?
Can you imagine? Hum!

818
00:55:18,772--> 00:55:23,172
DUNKIN DONUTS
exploding outside in the space.

819
00:55:23,173--> 00:55:25,273
And if he/she sweats mission and a bargain?

820
00:55:25,274--> 00:55:28,174
His/her success is been doesn't measure him/it that you
to listen of the final declaration of the justice.

821
00:55:28,275--> 00:55:29,675
What you this suggesting?

822
00:55:29,676--> 00:55:34,176
- The factor risk and high Farmer.
- But and an education risk.

823
00:55:34,177--> 00:55:36,677
Did you read the case studying there is time?

824
00:55:36,678--> 00:55:40,478
The profit that can make putting
that business of orange r board?

825
00:55:40,479--> 00:55:42,579
I made a graph,
did you take a look?

826
00:55:42,580--> 00:55:45,480
Oh, yes Charles,
I created three children with that business.

827
00:55:45,581--> 00:55:46,981
That is part of many of us.

828
00:55:46,982--> 00:55:49,248
As this that small cheese
of yogurt that you have now?

829
00:55:49,283--> 00:55:52,683
I want to say; tell me that happens
if all his/her mission turns shit?

830
00:55:52,684--> 00:55:54,784
I want to say,
I can work with more fertilizer.

831
00:55:54,785--> 00:55:56,685
You want to say;
how if I will die?

832
00:55:56,786--> 00:55:59,186
If something happens with you Farmer.

833
00:55:59,387--> 00:56:06,287
To break ankles, to stick to fire, if that
to turn reality, I will be without customers.

834
00:56:06,288--> 00:56:09,688
You probably anger to need
of the guardian angel Manakel.

835
00:56:09,689--> 00:56:10,689
Look, if you die...

836
00:56:10,690--> 00:56:18,090
The done agreement, good morning America, film in TV,
Jay Lennon, all this had disappeared.

837
00:56:18,091--> 00:56:22,291
Devils, without a mission well happened,
I will be going back to the red.

838
00:56:22,293--> 00:56:25,293
As I will be struggling to get some
money, to sell my next stock?

839
00:56:25,394--> 00:56:29,194
Because everything that you will be
producing will be tons of tears.

840
00:56:29,195--> 00:56:31,395
If you show for the world...

841
00:56:31,396--> 00:56:35,296
If you return r to land in his/her back yard,
as his/her mission plan says.

842
00:56:35,297--> 00:56:39,497
You and the transformed man
in the American hero.

843
00:56:39,498--> 00:56:42,498
Now as if I could just throw
a rocket with donuts with jelly.

844
00:56:42,799--> 00:56:44,699
Sunshine, why you
doesn't it take one for the grandpa, right?

845
00:56:44,800--> 00:56:46,700
Him this with problem in the ankles.

846
00:56:46,701--> 00:56:48,501
Light for the grandpa a donuts,
knife Sunshine.

847
00:56:48,502--> 00:56:50,502
Do just catch two, right?

848
00:56:50,703--> 00:56:52,603
Just sweet.

849
00:56:52,604--> 00:56:54,304
Do you want one?

850
00:56:54,305--> 00:56:56,305
No, wanted I ate 3 or 4...

851
00:56:56,306--> 00:56:59,606
- About 7 glasses of coffee.
- Uau!

852
00:56:59,807--> 00:57:02,507
Grandpa, here has donuts.

853
00:57:03,008--> 00:57:05,308
Grandpa, here has donuts.

854
00:57:11,909--> 00:57:13,909
Grandpa, doesn't wake up.

855
00:57:13,910--> 00:57:15,310
What was candy?

856
00:57:16,011--> 00:57:19,311
Grandpa doesn't wake up.

857
00:57:33,212--> 00:57:35,012
Father?

858
00:58:38,213--> 00:58:40,713
He/she doesn't have stop signs there.

859
00:58:43,314--> 00:58:45,714
He/she doesn't have defined space.

860
00:58:48,915--> 00:58:52,015
We always defined our space.

861
00:58:53,716--> 00:58:56,616
Us whole we are here,
and running for there.

862
00:58:57,817--> 00:59:01,517
He/she always comes from our roots.

863
00:59:02,318--> 00:59:07,918
We have that way of we divide ours
space ties find our direction.

864
00:59:10,318--> 00:59:14,018
It does tie created
I space for the deads.

865
00:59:16,519--> 00:59:20,219
Spaces and a thing
difficult to understand.

866
00:59:23,220--> 00:59:24,720
Main Farmer,

867
00:59:24,721--> 00:59:28,521
You have the most complex thoughts.

868
00:59:28,522--> 00:59:30,922
Oh, face that doesn't make sense none.

869
00:59:31,623--> 00:59:36,723
I am only waiting for another idea,
for the next semester together we pass.

870
00:59:37,624--> 00:59:40,924
Who this there now?

871
00:59:42,725--> 00:59:46,225
Maybe one of the friends
lost wants a house.

872
00:59:55,526--> 00:59:56,726
How this?

873
00:59:57,427--> 01:00:00,627
I brought the cattle to graze on here.

874
01:00:01,028--> 01:00:03,028
I was not informed.

875
01:00:03,529--> 01:00:06,129
You and the proprietor?

876
01:00:07,630--> 01:00:09,330
Yes.

877
01:00:09,931--> 01:00:12,131
- Charles Farmer?
- Correct.

878
01:00:12,132--> 01:00:14,232
I am freezing his/her earth,

879
01:00:14,333--> 01:00:17,633
for the National Bank
as action of quittance of the debt.

880
01:00:17,933--> 01:00:21,633
Which his/her name? Mister...

881
01:00:21,934--> 01:00:24,734
- Which his/her name again?
- Robert Wilson.

882
01:00:24,735--> 01:00:26,635
Robert, pleasure in you know him/it.

883
01:00:26,636--> 01:00:30,036
You know, I am owner of 352 acres.

884
01:00:30,037--> 01:00:34,037
You already tried to find a corpse,
in an earth of that dimension?

885
01:00:34,938--> 01:00:37,938
I am not the evil of here Mr.

886
01:00:38,739--> 01:00:42,039
Well, you also no and the bonzinho.

887
01:00:54,040--> 01:00:57,740
Well, Shepard I think I discovered one
way of solving the problem of the fuel.

888
01:00:57,741--> 01:01:00,641
We can combine
kerosene oil with 'hybridized'

889
01:01:00,642--> 01:01:01,842
Are you sure of that?

890
01:01:01,843--> 01:01:03,943
Well, in any way that and the
he/she sorts things out that we have to do.

891
01:01:03,944--> 01:01:05,444
Or we will have to modify the motor.

892
01:01:05,545--> 01:01:08,245
Haul of that, we have all
the things well here in the barn.

893
01:01:08,546--> 01:01:12,846
The fuel continues working with high
pressure, and it burns ties to find the camera.

894
01:01:12,847--> 01:01:16,847
Oxidizer, liberates gauzes, he/she has high
performance for rocket fuel

895
01:01:16,848--> 01:01:20,548
That shit provides us the
enough to put me in orbit.

896
01:01:20,749--> 01:01:22,349
Does he/she make sense?

897
01:01:23,050--> 01:01:24,750
Yes, yes.

898
01:01:27,851--> 01:01:29,451
Farmer?!

899
01:01:29,452--> 01:01:31,652
Yes, I am here at the engineering room.

900
01:01:31,653--> 01:01:32,653
Ei!

901
01:01:33,954--> 01:01:35,554
Did they already make a decision?

902
01:01:35,755--> 01:01:38,355
Why do you think I am here?

903
01:01:39,256--> 01:01:43,056
The committee wants 60 days
to make a decision.

904
01:01:43,057--> 01:01:46,357
But I don't have 60 days, the bank
it will take the farm in one week.

905
01:01:46,358--> 01:01:48,558
I am knowing about that.

906
01:01:53,859--> 01:01:55,959
I don't have that whole time.

907
01:01:55,960--> 01:01:57,560
That and their plan.

908
01:01:57,861--> 01:02:00,361
You think they want
what do you throw that?

909
01:02:00,462--> 01:02:04,762
They will roll up, to roll up, to roll up, and then
there will be appeals, that had continued forever.

910
01:02:05,663--> 01:02:07,863
You this prepared for that?

911
01:02:24,264--> 01:02:27,164
I feel a lot for the wait Farmer.

912
01:02:29,265--> 01:02:31,865
Yes.

913
01:02:35,765--> 01:02:40,065
You know, my father loved to be a farmer.

914
01:02:40,466--> 01:02:43,466
He loved of the bottom of the heart.

915
01:02:47,167--> 01:02:49,967
It was his dream.

916
01:02:54,268--> 01:02:57,668
It is then the things were difficult and...

917
01:02:58,169--> 01:03:01,569
It is then they tried
to remove his ranch.

918
01:03:02,170--> 01:03:06,470
And he put one
he/she arms in his head...

919
01:03:07,471--> 01:03:09,271
Before they were able to.

920
01:03:14,272--> 01:03:18,572
And to that candy it continues traveling...

921
01:03:19,473--> 01:03:21,873
And she just continues coming...

922
01:03:22,174--> 01:03:25,474
It is now comes direct for my dream.

923
01:03:27,575--> 01:03:31,975
Just promise me that you
he/she won't make some nonsense.

924
01:03:31,976--> 01:03:36,076
- How to travel in a rocket?
- No.

925
01:03:36,077--> 01:03:39,077
I know better than that.

926
01:03:39,978--> 01:03:43,378
I came the backs previously...

927
01:03:44,479--> 01:03:47,379
And I cannot turn the backs again.

928
01:03:47,580--> 01:03:49,580
Charles?!

929
01:03:50,981--> 01:03:53,981
I just am not able to
to continue failing.

930
01:03:55,082--> 01:03:57,482
I hope you understand that.

931
01:03:59,583--> 01:04:02,383
Me Ihe promise that everything had been well.

932
01:04:02,484--> 01:04:03,784
No!

933
01:04:07,485--> 01:04:09,485
Shepard?!

934
01:04:33,986--> 01:04:35,786
Let us go.

935
01:05:52,887--> 01:05:56,787
Does Charles, Charles get me to hear?

936
01:05:57,688--> 01:06:01,788
No! don't move, don't move
he/she had been well, we are going well this everything.

937
01:06:01,789--> 01:06:02,789
Oh, my God.

938
01:06:02,790--> 01:06:07,690
Don't dare in leaving that family!
You are with me!

939
01:06:21,691--> 01:06:24,891
Six broken ribs,
I pulse of the broken left arm.

940
01:06:25,092--> 01:06:29,592
Moved knee,
severe trauma in the head.

941
01:06:29,593--> 01:06:32,193
Multiple lacerac.es in the face.

942
01:06:36,494--> 01:06:39,294
Doesn't he/she have any good news?

943
01:06:40,295--> 01:06:42,195
Him this lives.

944
01:07:17,596--> 01:07:20,296
Welcome for the history, Texas

Sit tight wanted, you have
what strong being for his/her father now, right?

946
01:07:25,698--> 01:07:28,298
He needs to hear him/it as we loved him.

947
01:07:28,299--> 01:07:30,899
It is very important.

We go wanted, why us no
will we catch something to drink, right?

951
01:07:48,403--> 01:07:50,803
We can spend some money.

952
01:07:50,904--> 01:07:54,204
Stanley! Stanley, wanted.

953
01:08:09,405--> 01:08:14,005
Father.

954
01:08:15,506--> 01:08:17,806
And the Shepard father.

955
01:08:24,907--> 01:08:28,407
I was looking in the barn today.

956
01:08:28,408--> 01:08:31,808
He/she wants to say, us
we can build another equal.

957
01:08:31,809--> 01:08:35,909
I take oath, we can gather everything inside
of the barn, we can build everything.

GOD BLESSES OURS
ASTRONAUT FARMER

961
01:09:09,613--> 01:09:12,113
And children, when they say for
not to try to do that home.

962
01:09:12,114--> 01:09:13,814
They speak serialize, Jorge Marrone...

963
01:09:14,015--> 01:09:16,115
Certain, vain in front, yes the one what?

964
01:09:16,116--> 01:09:17,116
Right.

965
01:09:17,117--> 01:09:19,017
Ask for them as
time we will have to be here.

966
01:09:19,018--> 01:09:21,018
- Ask for them.
- Right.

967
01:09:21,119--> 01:09:23,619
Yes! Everything well.

968
01:09:23,620--> 01:09:26,120
L.A. he/she told us to be strong.

969
01:09:28,121--> 01:09:32,021
Being two months,
maybe I will receive a promotion.

970
01:09:34,522--> 01:09:36,422
He/she doesn't have propaganda, logomarca.

971
01:09:36,723--> 01:09:39,123
The high construction
technology Rockfill...

972
01:09:39,124--> 01:09:41,224
and clearly not and
project for amateurs.

973
01:09:41,624--> 01:09:45,024
Therefore we have firm rules,
and regulations for they be respected.

974
01:09:45,025--> 01:09:48,525
The space life and it would be
in Denver, one should not imitate.

975
01:09:48,526--> 01:09:52,326
We can only have the hope,
that through that fatal tragedy.

976
01:09:52,327--> 01:09:54,927
Others animated by the
the space falls in the reality.

977
01:09:55,028--> 01:09:58,728
<i> THE bargain that happened here with
Farmer, was impelled by the media.</i>

978
01:09:59,329--> 01:10:01,229
<i> I won't answer more questions.</i>

979
01:10:29,428--> 01:10:32,728
That stupid I am.

980
01:10:34,029--> 01:10:38,129
You have so much to live,
doesn't he/she want to leave me here?

981
01:10:38,330--> 01:10:40,030
No.

982
01:10:41,730--> 01:10:44,430
You this lives and he/she can walk.

983
01:10:48,031--> 01:10:53,331
They should bring me some cereal.

984
01:11:35,632--> 01:11:38,732
- I am going to the moon and I want to take somebody...
- Stanley!

985
01:11:38,733--> 01:11:41,433
We won't play that
do I play that night, right?

986
01:11:42,334--> 01:11:44,134
But, why?

987
01:11:45,235--> 01:11:47,935
Because she said.

988
01:11:49,236--> 01:11:51,336
Please wanted.

989
01:12:25,937--> 01:12:27,237
This everything well.

990
01:12:28,138--> 01:12:30,538
Shepard...

991
01:12:30,739--> 01:12:33,039
You have to give a time for him.

992
01:12:35,740--> 01:12:40,840
Father, this a little tired, you know,
he needs... he needs rest.

993
01:13:04,341--> 01:13:08,241
Everything this well writing, and the
his/her father's will this very clear one.

994
01:13:08,942--> 01:13:13,742
Three savings for the children,
haul of that US$200 in ASEDS...

995
01:13:13,743--> 01:13:18,243
And other US$200 thousand in money,
some ac.es and titles.

996
01:13:18,844--> 01:13:20,644
And everything yours.

997
01:13:21,645--> 01:13:25,345
Problems with the bank will be
solved in any way.

998
01:13:26,246--> 01:13:28,146
Thank you.

999
01:14:01,847--> 01:14:04,247
- Look at that!
- Look I found one!

1000
01:14:04,548--> 01:14:07,548
This good children.

1001
01:14:10,649--> 01:14:13,949
- Look, I found other again!
- Look, I found other again!

1002
01:14:23,250--> 01:14:27,450
I will catch the rocket and
I go take him/it for the old iron.

1003
01:14:27,451--> 01:14:31,151
- Charles...
- Audie, already hurt them enough.

1004
01:14:33,952--> 01:14:37,152
I don't want more to torture that family.

1005
01:14:51,553--> 01:14:56,553
Well, everything this
now paid off, and updated...

1006
01:14:56,654--> 01:15:00,054
I won't need more to pass to execute
the debt, they don't need more if they worry.

1007
01:15:00,055--> 01:15:01,755
Thank you Arnie.

1008
01:15:02,256--> 01:15:04,356
You made the right thing.

1009
01:15:06,057--> 01:15:07,757
Oh, boy.

1010
01:15:08,358--> 01:15:14,358
The people of here always
they believed that he could go to the space.

1011
01:15:17,859--> 01:15:21,259
We were with face of stupid.

1012
01:15:27,760--> 01:15:29,960
What?

1013
01:15:36,561--> 01:15:38,361
He/she knows, when us
we made our votes...

1014
01:15:38,362--> 01:15:42,062
We promised ourselves love
in the health and in the disease.

1015
01:15:43,763--> 01:15:46,263
Does that mean mental health?

1016
01:15:46,264--> 01:15:48,764
Because you and crazy.

1017
01:15:50,765--> 01:15:54,065
I want to say, when you said for the first
time that wanted to go for the space I thought...

1018
01:15:54,066--> 01:15:58,266
Well... that man doesn't say
that he/she wants to go for the space.

1019
01:15:59,767--> 01:16:02,067
The difference now...

1020
01:16:02,102--> 01:16:04,368
We have a family...

1021
01:16:04,869--> 01:16:07,369
A beautiful family.

1022
01:16:08,269--> 01:16:11,969
And I see the girls looking at you.

1023
01:16:12,470--> 01:16:14,870
They adore you.

1024
01:16:16,871--> 01:16:21,471
They love their father
that he/she wants to go for the space.

1025
01:16:22,872--> 01:16:27,572
I don't want to be the responsible for
to kill that hope in their eyes.

1026
01:16:27,673--> 01:16:31,173
That message type you
he/she would be ordering for Shepard.

1027
01:16:32,274--> 01:16:36,674
I love that father that shows as it is done.

1028
01:16:41,875--> 01:16:43,775
My love.

1029
01:16:48,176--> 01:16:50,876
He/she has more money than enough here...

1030
01:16:50,877--> 01:16:53,977
For you to do everything
the one that needs do.

1031
01:16:58,678--> 01:17:06,378
Without the rocket, we are alone
a family disfuncional.

1032
01:17:35,179--> 01:17:38,479
Well, we rebuilt the rocket with
exact especificac.es of the original.

1033
01:17:38,480--> 01:17:40,480
We put the whole material in the head.

1034
01:17:40,481--> 01:17:44,881
We did experiences with oxygen in the capsule.

1035
01:17:46,082--> 01:17:47,382
20 thousand pounds of refined gasoline.

1036
01:17:47,483--> 01:17:50,083
During the first release that
fuel burns equally...

1037
01:17:50,084--> 01:17:53,584
Occurring us enough trust
to take the ship it ties the space.

1038
01:17:54,285--> 01:17:56,985
We used chemistry for rocket...

1039
01:17:59,786--> 01:18:01,486
The plan for the amount of
alternative fuel that we will use...

1040
01:18:01,587--> 01:18:02,787
Multiplying...

1041
01:18:05,288--> 01:18:10,288
Combining the
speed among 25 thousand...

1042
01:18:16,189--> 01:18:20,089
- Proving, proving, test.
- Testing, proving.

1043
01:18:24,190--> 01:18:27,490
5 thousand...  feet 23.

1044
01:18:35,191--> 01:18:38,291
Oxygen will last 3 times more than
I usually need for an orbit.

1045
01:18:38,392--> 01:18:41,192
But, that no and the largest danger.

1046
01:18:45,381--> 01:18:46,516

When you and child,
he/she wants to be same to the father.

he/she doesn't want anything with him.

Then when you
to grow if it had turned same to him.

1058
01:19:20,597--> 01:19:24,397
My father showed me one
thing when he died.

1059
01:19:25,998--> 01:19:29,398
He/she didn't go to die,
but the cessation.

1060
01:19:31,599--> 01:19:34,499
He/she doesn't matter what to happen with me today...

1061
01:19:34,500--> 01:19:37,900
My children will say that I didn't give up.

1062
01:19:38,901--> 01:19:42,001
And I can die knowing about that.

1063
01:19:56,902--> 01:19:59,102
Yes.

1064
01:20:01,103--> 01:20:02,903
Curse!

1065
01:20:02,904--> 01:20:06,404
We are already here
waiting there is a long time.

1072
01:20:49,710--> 01:20:54,610

and all the concentration that we have to give.

1073
01:20:54,611--> 01:20:58,011
Of my team,
my team of companions.

01:30:42,637--> 01:30:45,137
<i> Of a great release,
of some place in Texas.</i>

1179
01:30:45,338--> 01:30:46,638
He/she failed the connection. Without available sign

1180
01:30:46,739--> 01:30:50,539
<i> AND be there which is the reason, it seems for me,
in the group to the... my old friend Farmer.</i>

1181
01:30:50,740--> 01:30:53,140
We were knowing that FAA,
he/she denies categorically...

1182
01:30:53,241--> 01:30:55,441
The existence of any release.

1183
01:30:55,442--> 01:30:58,342
For the that we know Mr. Farmer
this resting comfortably...

1184
01:30:58,343--> 01:31:01,543
Probably attending that
it confers for the press in TV.

1185
01:31:01,544--> 01:31:05,244
Once again, he/she didn't have release.

1186
01:31:05,745--> 01:31:09,145
His/her father will return soon, we know.

1187
01:31:10,146--> 01:31:13,646
Father was thrown rs 09122.

1188
01:31:13,647--> 01:31:19,047
Then right now, he has state in
orbit for 8 hours, 56 minutes, 50 seconds.

1189
01:31:19,548--> 01:31:24,248
He traveled ties 152 thousand, 42 miles now.

1190
01:31:24,249--> 01:31:25,949
Well, when he returns?

1191
01:31:26,650--> 01:31:30,750
He maybe can have 12 or 13 orbits
before him reenters in the atmosphere of the earth.

1192
01:31:30,751--> 01:31:34,051
And when he understands that and then...

1193
01:31:36,052--> 01:31:37,552
What?

1194
01:31:38,953--> 01:31:42,753
He can be without oxygen.

1195
01:32:03,354--> 01:32:07,354
- I can still locate him, mother.
- Will rest.

1196
01:32:08,055--> 01:32:10,855
I don't get while
my father still needs me.

1197
01:32:10,856--> 01:32:12,256
And an order.

1198
01:32:14,557--> 01:32:16,757
I am proud of you.

1199
01:32:34,258--> 01:32:36,458
Do some tell thing Farmer?

1200
01:33:13,660--> 01:33:15,060
Shepard.

1201
01:33:16,461--> 01:33:18,161
We are going Shepard.

1202
01:33:19,962--> 01:33:21,262
Shepard?

1203
01:33:21,763--> 01:33:25,563
Shepard?! Can I hear myself?

1204
01:33:27,864--> 01:33:29,264
Shepard!

1205
01:33:31,565--> 01:33:33,465
We go there.

1206
01:33:34,066--> 01:33:36,066
We go there.

1207
01:33:37,267--> 01:33:39,167
God!

1208
01:34:31,968--> 01:34:33,468
Hello?

1209
01:34:33,669--> 01:34:34,869
<i> Hello?</i>

1210
01:34:34,970--> 01:34:38,070
<i> That and astronaut Farmer.</i>

1211
01:34:38,371--> 01:34:39,671
<i> we Go, control of the mission!</i>

1212
01:34:39,672--> 01:34:41,372
Father, and Shepard!

1213
01:34:42,273--> 01:34:44,873
Dad! Dad!

1214
01:34:45,474--> 01:34:47,774
I think don't go
to get to land in the back yard of the house.

1215
01:34:47,775--> 01:34:50,775
Don't worry, I am sending new
coordinates for the descent of the ship.

1216
01:34:50,776--> 01:34:52,976
You know what I am saying,
don't just point the nose for the entrance.

1217
01:34:53,177--> 01:34:55,677
When it goes down it had broken
the speed in 20%.

1218
01:34:55,778--> 01:34:58,778
- Getting ready to reenter.
- It can reenter.

1219
01:34:58,879--> 01:35:01,879
Good luck!
I will be monitoring you, father.

1220
01:37:29,580--> 01:37:33,780
- Like you he/she does sit down?
- Home.

1221
01:37:35,081--> 01:37:35,781
Hi, father.

1222
01:37:35,882--> 01:37:38,482
The children are agitated.

1223
01:37:40,683--> 01:37:43,083
Great clouds son.

1224
01:37:44,084--> 01:37:48,084
My father and good.
Let me to use a little!

1225
01:37:48,085--> 01:37:49,685
I won father.

1226
01:37:50,586--> 01:37:52,886
And when I use the clothes,
I want the father with me.

1227
01:37:52,887--> 01:37:55,087
I want to go r one
restaurant that has pizza.

1228
01:37:55,088--> 01:37:58,688
Certain, we can go there also.

1229
