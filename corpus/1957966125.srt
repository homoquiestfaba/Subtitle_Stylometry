1
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,166
- As we have discussed
previously, Justin
is agoraphobic.

2
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,872
A condition I've explained
and given you information on.

3
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,241
But I feel the need to add

4
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:25,346
a diagnosis of
schizotypal disorder.

5
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,114
- Schizotypal?

6
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,417
So just what exactly
does that mean?

7
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:32,650
- Ah, schizotypal.

8
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,887
It's a mental disorder.

9
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,257
Usually appears in late
teens and early adulthood,

10
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,528
but sometimes it can
manifest in childhood.

11
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,464
- Okay, so?

12
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,002
- Well, a person with
schizotypal disorder,

13
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,038
they tend to isolate themselves.

14
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,473
They may exhibit atypical
social behavior patterns

15
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,644
and paranoid ideations.

16
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,283
- He locks himself in his room,

17
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,517
is obsessed with
becoming, you know,

18
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,586
the world's next Van Gogh.

19
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,157
- Does Justin ever leave
the house on his own?

20
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,461
You know, without coaxing?

21
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,832
- He does have an elderly
lady he goes and sees often.

22
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:24,704
You know, she's a kind
of a crackpot, but nice.

23
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,040
She used to be a teacher,

24
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,875
so she helps him with
his homeschool lessons,

25
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,213
and you know, lets him
stay there when I'm out.

26
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,283
She's one of the few people
he feels comfortable with.

27
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,822
- How would you characterize
yourself as a mother?

28
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,759
Are you loving? Nurturing?

29
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,527
- This isn't the part
of the conversation

30
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,562
where you're gonna pull that...

31
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,034
"It's all the mother's
fault" business, is it?

32
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,202
Because if it is,
I can tell you,

33
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,004
I busted my ass for that kid.

34
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,539
I had him when I was 16!

35
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,242
And you can't just, no!

36
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,413
- Please. Don't
misunderstand me.

37
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:11,152
These are important
questions, not accusations.

38
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:19,759
The best case scenario is that
he will simply outgrow this.

39
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,862
He's very healthy,
for the most part.

40
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,599
He just takes certain
behaviors to the extreme.

41
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,069
I mean, having
interviewed him privately,

42
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,603
he has a firm grip on reality.

43
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,610
The behaviors he exhibits
are just coping mechanisms,

44
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,778
to help him work through
the things that disturb him

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,916
and make him quiet.

46
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,552
- You said best case scenario.

47
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,653
So let's hear the worst.

48
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,490
- Okay.

49
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:54,827
Occasionally, and very rarely,

50
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,665
schizotypal disorder can
progress into schizophrenia.

51
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,102
I mean, Justin is
eccentric for his age,

52
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,971
but he's grounded in reality.

53
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,143
Schizophrenics, they lose
touch with reality altogether.

54
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:14,079
They hear voices that
are very real to them.

55
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,983
As real as a conversation you
and I are having right now.

56
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,120
- So what you're saying is,
he's just kind of nuts now,

57
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,921
but on his way to
being even more nuts?

58
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,590
- Please, hear me out.

59
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,993
I think we can treat him with
cognitive behavior therapy.

60
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,661
- Let's go with this
worst case scenario.

61
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,434
Let's say my son
goes bobo loony!

62
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,136
Then what?

63
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,371
- I know of a wonderful
inpatient facility

64
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,242
for children with this disorder.

65
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,978
- Two grand to
get to this point?

66
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,881
Shit!

67
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,716
- Miss Travers, please.

68
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,618
- Let's go!

69
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,886
Now!

70
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,287
Come on!

71
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,121
- Ow, God.

72
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,156
- Let's go!

73
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:57,990
- Take it easy!

74
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,458
- Your father was nuts!

75
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,528
My mother, your
grandmother was nuts!

76
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,964
Your Aunt Joanie is nuts,
your cousin Suzette, nuts.

77
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,900
You don't get to
be crazy, Justin.

78
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,700
There has to be a normal gene

79
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,238
in our gene pool somewhere!

80
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,771
- But Mom-

81
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,207
- No, you don't get
to be crazy, Justin.

82
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,111
You just don't.

83
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,145
God damn it!

84
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,647
- Hurry up, Mom.

85
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,615
- I'm coming.

86
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:28,622
Piece of shit.

87
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,964
Justin.

88
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,666
Justin, wait.

89
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,000
I wanna talk to you.

90
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,743
Justin!

91
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,447
Justin, wait.

92
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,281
Wait!

93
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,318
I wanna talk to you.

94
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,487
Wait!

95
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,755
I wanna talk to...

96
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,058
Justin.

97
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,926
Justin!

98
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,696
I swear to God, you
turn that shit down.

99
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,732
I have something to say,
and you are gonna hear it.

100
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:14,902
Off!

101
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,008
Now this is how it's
gonna go down tomorrow.

102
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,710
I have a lot to do
in the afternoon,

103
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,779
so I'm gonna let
you off at the park.

104
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:28,981
- Oh hell no!

105
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,349
- Justin!

106
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,552
I swear to God, this shit stops.

107
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,220
If you continue to
behave this way,

108
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,990
I'm taking away all
your art supplies,

109
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:41,326
all your posters and your iPod.

110
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,696
All your traveling,
psychology magazines.

111
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,597
- Go away!

112
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,531
- That's it.

113
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,033
You open the door right now,

114
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,502
or I'm taking it off the hinges.

115
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,937
I'm going to get
the screwdriver.

116
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:52,840
One, two...

117
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,447
Now that's better.

118
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,285
Let me see your face.

119
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:13,027
Okay, look, we are
gonna take baby steps.

120
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,562
You can take your art
box and your iPod.

121
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,499
I don't expect you
to make friends yet,

122
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,103
but you can at least
be around other kids.

123
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:27,239
You cooperate and you
get to keep your door,

124
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,776
and all your stuff.

125
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:30,611
Deal?

126
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:36,917
Jesus Christ.

127
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,043
- Vinny.

128
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,815
Vinny, are you there?

129
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,816
- Greetings,
my young protege.

130
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,317
Are you having
trouble sleeping also?

131
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,386
- Yeah.

132
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,854
You need sleep?

133
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,322
- Of course.

134
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,958
Your soul does not lose
its need to be replenished.

135
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,293
- Oh.

136
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,729
- I have been
fascinating on something,

137
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,499
perhaps you could
be of assistance.

138
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,935
I'm planning a trip in
the future to the Louvre,

139
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,771
and I would like to
perform, how shall I say,

140
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,809
some harmless little pranks?

141
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,413
So, shall I tilt the Mona Lisa?

142
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,815
Or shall I have security's pants

143
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:45,717
suddenly come loose and
fall about his ankles?

144
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,820
- I think you should do both.

145
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,056
- Perhaps I shall.

146
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,426
what's on your
mind, this glooming?

147
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,365
- Well, I'm kind of
embarrassed to say.

148
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,665
- Well, you know you can share

149
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,934
your inner most
thoughts with me.

150
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,536
How does the saying go?

151
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,874
Dead men tell no tales.

152
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,408
- That's not a
saying, it's a book.

153
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,611
- Mm. Thank you for
the astute correction.

154
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,616
But what is concerning you?

155
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,856
- Mom's making me go
to the park tomorrow.

156
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,190
- What could be more delightful
than a day at the park

157
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,591
for an 11 year old boy?

158
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,827
- You know why.

159
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,761
- Mm, well.

160
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,132
Sometimes we must
just face our fears.

161
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,434
What would life be like if
we never had the courage

162
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,968
to attempt anything?

163
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,603
- I'm not scared.

164
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,875
- Mm, if not
trepidation, than what?

165
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,413
- I just like it better here
with my things, and you.

166
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,853
- And I too greatly enjoy our
time together, Master Justin.

167
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,754
But it remains a
curiosity what deters you

168
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:59,257
from seeking the companionship
of children your own age.

169
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,830
- I don't know,
it just doesn't feel right.

170
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,230
- Justin?

171
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:10,803
Justin.

172
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,070
- What, Mom?

173
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,174
- Who the hell
are you talking to?

174
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:15,974
- Nobody.

175
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:16,975
- Exactly.

176
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,880
Now settle down and go to sleep.

177
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,148
- We can converse
later, my young protege.

178
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,218
But remember, what
would life be like

179
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,054
if we never had the courage
to attempt anything?

180
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,825
- Justin, are you
going to sleep?

181
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,493
- How can I go to
sleep when you keep yelling?

182
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:37,162
- You're as mouthy as
your dad used to be.

183
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,998
Justin, remember what I
said about all your stuff?

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,333
I don't wanna hear
one more peep.

185
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,268
You're gonna go to
the park tomorrow,

186
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,172
and you're gonna have
a wonderful time.

187
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:55,449
Life would be easier if I
had a kid I could ground.

188
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,389
Justin, let's go!

189
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,091
Come on!

190
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,463
Could you walk any slower?

191
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,900
Let's go, chop chop!

192
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:16,268
Did you remember to
bring your inhaler?

193
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,335
- Yeah, I got it.

194
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,137
- Speak up, Justin.

195
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,672
And stop that damn mumbling.

196
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,676
I asked you if you
brought your inhaler.

197
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,712
- What does it matter?
You won't be around to see

198
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,915
if I have an asthma
attack or not.

199
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,115
- Don't pull that shit with me,

200
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,449
and knock it off
with the guilt trip.

201
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,353
Do you have it or not?

202
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,521
- Are you happy now?

203
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,357
- Yeah.

204
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,804
Carla is such a little
sweetheart, ugh.

205
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,538
You know, she lives
close to Aggie.

206
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,206
Maybe you could
visit her sometime.

207
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,075
I bet she gets lonely.

208
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,878
- She's a freak.

209
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,779
- Why? Because
she's handicapped?

210
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,282
- No, I don't think she's a
freak because she's handicapped.

211
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,718
I think she's a freak because
she's not handicapped.

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,653
- What do you mean
she's not handicapped?

213
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,056
She can't walk,
for Christ's sake.

214
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:11,059
- She can walk.

215
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,126
- Are you saying she's
faking being crippled?

216
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,963
- She's not exactly faking it.

217
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:19,264
- What the hell are
you talking about then?

218
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,466
- She had a conversion reaction.

219
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,467
- A what?

220
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,036
- A conversion reaction.

221
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,503
It's when you don't wanna
deal with something,

222
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,973
and you don't wanna
think about it,

223
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,076
and that problem transfers
to a physical problem.

224
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,279
- Where the hell did
you get that garbage?

225
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,479
Ugh.

226
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,683
God damn it.

227
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,520
Yards and parks to play in,
they gotta run in the street.

228
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,926
Anyway, what kind of crap
are you talking about?

229
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:49,962
- I read about it in my
21st Psychology magazine.

230
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,297
She can walk with
the proper therapy.

231
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,033
- Proper therapy.

232
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,334
Concentrate on your
own therapy, Justin.

233
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,770
And if I'm gonna continue
to give you an allowance,

234
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,806
you need to order more
age appropriate stuff.

235
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,875
And I know with all the crap

236
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,776
that's probably building
up in your room,

237
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,313
I know well that you are
playing on Aggie's sympathies.

238
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,582
You know, it's not right to let
that old lady give you money

239
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,084
for a bunch of
off the wall shit.

240
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,351
- Well, Aggie's smart.

241
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,987
She agrees with me about Carla.

242
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:15,787
She told me.

243
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,255
- Justin.

244
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,190
It is just plain strange that
you're an 11 year old boy,

245
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,293
and you spend your
time gossiping with
that old busybody.

246
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,263
It's weird.

247
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:30,071
Now, I want you to stay
here at least an hour.

248
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:34,639
After that, you can walk
home and drop in on Aggie.

249
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:35,875
- Walk home?

250
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,109
Why the hell can't
you pick me up?

251
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,611
- I told you, I
have things to do.

252
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,147
- Like what?

253
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,949
- Like go to the store and
fill out job applications.

254
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,517
- I don't know my way home.

255
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,019
- Justin.

256
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,123
You know this neighborhood
like the back of your hand.

257
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,624
- I think I'm gonna
hyperventilate.

258
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,758
- Ha!

259
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,593
- The hell is so damn funny?

260
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,594
- You.

261
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,530
You are not getting out of this.

262
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,665
Look, there's an
empty picnic bench.

263
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,838
Take your art box, go sit
down, and draw something.

264
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,506
- Fine.

265
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:12,737
- Would
you like a drink?

266
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,206
- Oh yeah, that's my girl.

267
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,308
- Oh!

268
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,114
- You stay right...

269
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,221
- Sonny.

270
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:30,555
- Hello, birthday boy.

271
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,124
Is this the call to thank me?

272
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:33,291
- Thank you for what?

273
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,726
- The birthday
gift I sent you.

274
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,095
Has it arrived?

275
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:37,328
- No, man.

276
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,165
I didn't have time
to go to my mailbox.

277
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,001
- Oh, it's way too
big to fit in your mailbox.

278
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:44,702
It'll be delivered
to your front door.

279
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,038
- Yeah, whatever man.

280
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,073
This chick you
hired, she stinks.

281
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,741
- Huh? Who stinks?

282
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,845
- This....

283
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:53,979
Sierra Love chick.

284
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:55,981
It's a pain in the ass
editing this stuff.

285
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,016
- Not enjoying it, kid?

286
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:57,917
- Are you kidding me?

287
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,285
She can't act.

288
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,352
- Rocket, think
about what you doing.

289
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,554
- I am.

290
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,856
I wrote a good plot
with a decent storyline,

291
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,490
and this chick blows.

292
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,859
- Mm.

293
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,526
Isn't that the point?

294
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,862
- Screw you, Sonny.

295
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:11,329
Sex is secondary here.

296
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:15,201
- Rocket, you think our
fans are looking for a plot?

297
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,869
Get a grip.

298
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,304
Listen.

299
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:21,240
We're not trying to make
Sundance worthy projects here.

300
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:24,342
What the hell's wrong
with you, birthday boy?

301
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:50,537
- Who is it?

302
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:55,307
- Open the door and
close your eyes,

303
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,880
Rocket, sweetie, you're
in for a big surprise.

304
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,047
- Oh, what the hell.

305
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,650
Yeah, yeah, I'm
coming, I'm coming.

306
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,625
- Happy birthday, from Sonny.

307
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,430
I'm Bambi.

308
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,272
What's wrong, handsome?

309
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:27,239
Cat got your tongue?

310
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,642
- Yeah, something like that.

311
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,711
Sorry, I wasn't
expecting company.

312
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,347
- Looks like you could
use a woman around here

313
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,916
to take care of you.

314
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,085
You like champagne?

315
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,585
- A little early, sweetheart.

316
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,421
Well...

317
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,994
How long are you
gonna be here for?

318
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,130
- As long as you
want, birthday boy.

319
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,366
Sonny said you've
got a running tab.

320
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,801
His treat.

321
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,303
- Good ol' Sonny.

322
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:00,341
- So, what's your pleasure?

323
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,309
- You know what
would be really sexy?

324
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,644
- What's that, handsome?

325
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,980
- If you went into the kitchen

326
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:10,082
in that cute little
number you're wearing...

327
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,350
- Mhm.

328
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:13,385
- Got the sink full of suds-

329
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,687
- Oh, I like the
way you're thinking.

330
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:20,694
- And did the dishes for me.

331
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,064
- Your wish is my command.

332
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:41,080
- Hey, look at this kid.

333
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:42,049
Let's get him.

334
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,782
Hey, little girl.

335
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:45,987
What you got in the box?

336
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,420
- Loser!

337
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,455
- None of your damn business.

338
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,123
That's what I got in the box.

339
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,958
- Oh man, he means business.

340
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,525
- Ooh!

341
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,861
- Get away from me!

342
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,062
- What's this?

343
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,798
Drawing something
pretty for your mama?

344
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,266
- I don't think she'll like it.

345
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,736
How about you start over?

346
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,008
- Oh, are you gonna cry?

347
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,582
- You're doing a
really good job.

348
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,686
You'll make a
wonderful wife someday.

349
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:23,991
You ever do any modeling?

350
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,825
- Oh yeah, all the time.

351
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,360
You know, I just
got back from Paris

352
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,231
on this shoot for
the cover of Cosmo.

353
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,532
- You got kind of a
smart mouth on you.

354
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,635
I like that in a lady.

355
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:37,938
Keeps things interesting.

356
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:05,833
Hey.

357
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,036
I know I've been kind
of ignoring you, I...

358
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,171
- I don't do this.

359
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,007
- Don't do?

360
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:14,875
- This.

361
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,476
- My son.

362
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:18,479
He's sick.

363
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:29,421
I think someone is calling.

364
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:30,291
- It can wait.

365
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:35,563
- Maybe it's important.

366
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:38,798
- Just one sec.

367
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,202
Yeah, Sonny?

368
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:44,436
- Hey, Rocket.

369
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:46,538
You don't have one
actress, Leslie Jones?

370
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,841
Well, word on the
street is that she's 15!

371
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:50,708
- What? How could
you let this happen?

372
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,178
- It's not my
fault! She said she was 21.

373
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,380
She looks 21, she acts 21.

374
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,882
She gave me her ID.

375
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,150
- Jesus Christ.

376
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,018
'Cause nobody's ever
used a fake ID before.

377
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,587
You shady son of a...

378
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,788
You said everything was
gonna be above board.

379
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,924
No druggies, nobody underage,

380
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:07,526
we're running a
legitimate business.

381
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,061
Ring any bells?

382
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,761
- It is legit!

383
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,730
- Have we filmed
anything with her yet?

384
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,966
- No.

385
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,801
- Okay, okay, okay.

386
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:17,002
Good, if she comes
by the studio,

387
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,537
we'll tell her to kick rocks.

388
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,442
I'll head down there right now
and do some damage control.

389
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:25,043
Listen, I'm sorry.

390
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:25,878
I gotta...

391
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,180
- No, it's fine.

392
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,281
- You okay?

393
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:30,115
- Yeah, yeah.

394
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,018
I'm fine, I'm fine.

395
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,253
- Hey, what's your real name?

396
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,321
I know it's not Bambi.

397
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:37,124
- It's Deena.

398
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,302
- Aw, you little crybaby.

399
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,707
Are you gonna cry?

400
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,011
- Not so fast, you
little piece of shit.

401
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:00,747
And the rest of you
better not move.

402
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:03,117
What's going on here? Huh?

403
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:05,186
What'd he do to you?

404
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
Now you skinny little assholes

405
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:10,656
get down on your
hands and knees,

406
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:11,857
and pick that shit up.

407
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,192
You too.

408
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,328
Every damn bit of it.

409
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,097
That's better.

410
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:21,602
Now, you little punks, y'all
apologize to this young man.

411
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,270
I can't hear you. Speak up.

412
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:26,905
- Sorry.

413
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:27,740
- Mhm.

414
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:33,581
Now, we're let it go, this time.

415
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,116
But if I ever, and I mean ever,

416
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,520
witness some shit
like this again,

417
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:44,690
I'm gonna go to every
single one of your houses

418
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,525
and I'm gonna tell your parents

419
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,629
what a bunch of little
assholes you are.

420
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,729
And if they don't
whip y'all ass,

421
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,467
then I'll gladly do it for 'em.

422
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,836
'Cause Wishbone Devon,

423
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,839
he don't really like to
tell nobody nothing twice.

424
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:01,642
You got it?

425
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,745
I don't think I heard you.

426
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,514
- Yes, sir.

427
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,515
- Mhm.

428
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,517
Get y'all sorry asses home.

429
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,986
I walk past here every day,

430
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:16,789
and I don't wanna see y'all
ugly faces no time soon.

431
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,361
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

432
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:23,998
Don't you pay
those kids no mind.

433
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,899
Look, they ain't
nothing but punks.

434
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,403
Just little punks, that's all.

435
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:35,709
Yo, hold up.

436
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:38,045
Ooh!

437
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,180
You draw this?

438
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,080
- Yes, sir.

439
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,248
- Wow.

440
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,782
And you didn't
trace it or nothing?

441
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:45,617
- No, sir.

442
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,252
That's cheating.

443
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:48,453
- Wow.

444
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:50,422
What's your name,
kid? How old are you?

445
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:53,358
- My name's Justin Travers,
and I just turned 11.

446
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,128
My mom got me that art
box for my birthday.

447
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,999
- Well, Mr. Justin, she sure
did pick out the right gift.

448
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,970
You ever sell any
of your drawings?

449
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:04,672
- No, sir.

450
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,572
- Could I buy this?

451
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:08,642
- It's ruined.
- Oh!

452
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,411
That ain't nothing a little
Scotch tape can't fix.

453
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:13,512
Look at this, Tania.

454
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:14,381
Isn't this cool?

455
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,486
Mm, let's see.

456
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:22,321
How much would you take for it?

457
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:23,955
- Oh, it's okay.

458
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,357
If you really like it,
you could just have it.

459
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,958
- Nope, mm-mm.

460
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,193
No, sir.

461
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,762
You're gonna be a huge,
famous artist one day,

462
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,866
and that would be
taking advantage of you.

463
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:35,302
Let's see.

464
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:41,373
Well, I'm a little bit
short on cash today.

465
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,275
Would you take $5 for it?

466
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,111
- Sure.

467
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,278
- Yeah.

468
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,681
Hey, you just sold your
first piece of artwork.

469
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,149
How's that feel?

470
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:51,985
- Good.

471
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,187
- Where you live, kid?

472
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,922
You want me and Tania
to walk you home?

473
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:58,223
- No, it's okay.

474
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,025
I just live over
on Dowling Street.

475
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,960
- Dowling Street, huh?

476
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,095
You wouldn't happen
to know a lady

477
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,963
named Aggie Langford, would you?

478
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,998
- Sure, she's a
good friend of mine.

479
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:11,269
- Well, you just tell her that
Wishbone Devon says hello.

480
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,606
And kid, you do me a favor.

481
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:16,074
If anybody ever
bothers you again,

482
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,477
you tell 'em Wishbone
Devon will hunt them down

483
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,380
and kick they ass.

484
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,382
They'll know who I am.

485
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:25,953
Come on, baby.

486
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:35,494
- Hey, Daddy, don't you
like any of my drawings?

487
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,863
- I love your drawings, baby.

488
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:38,697
- You don't give me any money.

489
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,366
- That's 'cause I'm your daddy.
You give 'em to me for free.

490
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:42,334
- Oh.

491
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:43,769
- Oh.

492
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,803
♪ Heavy shackles used
to hold me down ♪

493
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:21,173
♪ Now my feet don't
even hit the ground ♪

494
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:25,277
♪ Just like a prisoner
at a sentencing ♪

495
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,148
♪ All my dreams
are coming true ♪

496
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,118
♪ I think ♪

497
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:17,899
♪ Now my dreams
are coming true ♪

498
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,663
- Oh, hold your horses.

499
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:56,936
Hey, I didn't expect
you until tomorrow.

500
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:57,870
- Guess what, Aggie?

501
00:28:57,872 --> 00:29:00,472
I went to the park alone.

502
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,440
- That's wonderful.

503
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,342
- Well, I didn't want to.

504
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:05,377
Mom made me.

505
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:06,780
She said it for my own good.

506
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:09,849
- How did it go?

507
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,485
- Well, not so good at first.

508
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,718
- Well, what happened?

509
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,987
- This group of kids attacked me

510
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,454
and broke a bunch of
stuff in my art box.

511
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:17,489
- Oh, no.

512
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,723
- It's okay, Aggie.

513
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:19,892
This guy that came by the park

514
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:21,126
with his little girl helped me.

515
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:22,864
He even bought one of
my drawings for $5.

516
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:24,663
- That's wonderful.

517
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:26,097
- He says he knows you.

518
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,401
His name's Wishbone Devon.

519
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,368
- Sweet Jesus.

520
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,638
Wishbone Devon?

521
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,878
Go inside, I got a
surprise for you.

522
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,310
It was many years ago.

523
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,646
He was one of my
foster children.

524
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,819
Just a little boy,
no younger than you.

525
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,089
He was a sweet little man.

526
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:25,925
So timid when he
first came to me.

527
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:29,596
Scared of his own shadow.

528
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,364
- He sure doesn't
act like that now.

529
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,234
- You know, I adored
that little guy.

530
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,870
Then my husband got sick,

531
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,371
and the social
worker who came by

532
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,873
to visit the kids
once in a while

533
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,407
said it was just too much for me

534
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,876
to take care of my
husband and the children

535
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:44,745
at the same time.

536
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,346
- So, what happened to Wishbone?

537
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:51,416
- Well, you know, he was
sent to a foster home,

538
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:54,287
and another and another.

539
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,224
I tried to keep tabs on him,

540
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,061
but he just got
lost in the system.

541
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:03,463
It's just sad how that happens.

542
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,299
Well, how about
I make you lunch?

543
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:11,403
Or are you full of lemon bars?

544
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,972
- No, it's okay.

545
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:15,875
I kinda wanna go home, 'cause
I'm working on something.

546
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,310
- School work, I hope.

547
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,545
You want me to walk with you?

548
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,150
- No, I'll be okay.

549
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:34,889
Mom?

550
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:40,393
Mom, you here?

551
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:46,932
- I'm up here, Justin.

552
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,401
I'll be right down.

553
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:00,948
Well, hey you.

554
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:03,583
So, how did it go?

555
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,585
- It was okay.

556
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,087
- What'd you do?

557
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,124
- Well, I set up at
the bench and I drew.

558
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:13,259
- Well, did you
make any friends?

559
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:14,661
- Yeah, a couple.

560
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,695
- Well, do you think you
might like to go back?

561
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,098
- Maybe.

562
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,366
Hey, do you know a guy name...

563
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,037
- Hang on.

564
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,574
Hello?

565
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,476
Oh, hi, Gina.

566
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:32,644
You know, actually, I was
just thinking about you.

567
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:33,913
I'll call you back, okay?

568
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:35,983
No, I gotta make Justin
something to eat.

569
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,751
Okay, yeah, no,
I'll call you back.

570
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:40,585
Okay, thanks.

571
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:41,821
Bye.

572
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,421
All right, yeah,
I'll let you know.

573
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:44,924
All right, thanks.

574
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:45,792
Okay, bye.

575
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,332
- So, at first I thought
he felt sorry for me

576
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,734
because of those
asshole in the park,

577
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,338
but I saw his face, and
his little girl's face.

578
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,539
- Her name is Tania,

579
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,943
and I think they really
like my drawings.

580
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,177
- Of course they did.

581
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,012
How could you feel
anything otherwise?

582
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:08,415
Remember who your mentor is.

583
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:13,486
So tell me about this
man, your new friend.

584
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,386
- Oh.

585
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:16,621
His name is Wishbone.

586
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,590
- That's
a very curious name.

587
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:20,259
- Well, that's just a nickname.

588
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:21,561
His real name is Clarence.

589
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,433
- We feel lonely
from time to time,

590
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:33,440
long for people, and
sing to ourselves.

591
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,009
We should be quite different,

592
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:38,376
and meet a friend
and say to ourselves,

593
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:39,579
"This could be the one."

594
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,582
But there's much self
deception in this longing.

595
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:47,785
If we yield to it too much, it
could lead us from the road.

596
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,454
- So you think I shouldn't
be friends with him?

597
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:50,923
- Quite the contrary.

598
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,826
What I'm saying is you
should make many friends.

599
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:55,729
- But I don't wanna
make a lot of friends.

600
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,101
Shh.

601
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:34,366
- There's a
sight for sore eyes.

602
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,035
- Hi, Jack.

603
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:37,336
- How you been?

604
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:40,372
- Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

605
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,341
- Yeah, how's Justy?

606
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:43,708
- Justin's moody as ever.

607
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,543
You know, holed up in
his room all the time

608
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,845
drawing and dreaming.

609
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:48,414
- Hey, you.

610
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:49,582
How you doin'?

611
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,519
Come here, let me
buy you a drink.

612
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:56,324
What are you drinking?

613
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:59,992
- Um, you know
what? Just a soda.

614
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:01,659
I'm here about a job.

615
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,162
- Jack.

616
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:05,665
Can you get her a soda, and
put it on my tab, please?

617
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:13,172
- So, how did it go?

618
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:15,176
You know, that
problem at your work.

619
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:18,543
- It blew over.

620
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:19,479
It always does.

621
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:22,716
- Well, that's good.

622
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:25,650
- How's your boy?

623
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:26,852
- My boy?

624
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:27,687
- Yeah.

625
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,457
He doesn't have cancer, does he?

626
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,060
- No, cancer, no.

627
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:35,828
- You said he was sick,
I don't know, my head-

628
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,262
- Oh, oh, well, he's sick,

629
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:38,998
but he's not sick sick.

630
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,032
You know?

631
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,402
Not like that, at least.

632
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,473
- What kinda homework
are you doing?

633
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:50,242
Whatever it is, it sure
is making you happy.

634
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:52,813
- Um, science.

635
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,991
- Now, mister.

636
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,861
You know I have a
rule in this house.

637
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:11,932
School work first.

638
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,836
And then...

639
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,807
Hm.

640
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:22,977
- Do you
think it's good?

641
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:25,346
- I think it's very good.

642
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,515
Who you drawing a picture of?

643
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,718
- It's Tania, the little
girl from the park.

644
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,359
- Ah, Tanny.

645
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:43,128
What did daddy tell you
about standing on that couch?

646
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,463
- It's a balance beam, Daddy.

647
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:46,731
I'm gonna be a gymnast.

648
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,967
- Yeah, that's a real
fine dream, baby.

649
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,836
But you won't be a gymnast

650
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,704
if you fall off of there
and break your little legs.

651
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:55,673
You said you wanted to
be an artist, right?

652
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:58,210
I don't know maybe that's
a little safer for you.

653
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:00,079
- I want to do both.

654
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:03,449
- And what do you plan to
do with it when you're done?

655
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,551
- I was thinking of
getting Wishbone's address

656
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:07,288
and sending it to
him as a present.

657
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:11,358
- Well, I think that's
very sweet, baby.

658
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,428
But I also think need to
concentrate on your schoolwork

659
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,030
at the moment.

660
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:20,299
- I know, I just have
one more thing to add.

661
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:21,834
Can I finish it, Aggie?

662
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:22,667
Please?

663
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:23,504
- All right.

664
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,406
15 minutes, and that's it.

665
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:28,606
- Thank you, Aggie.

666
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,776
- Mhm.

667
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:32,379
- Hey, Jack.

668
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,080
Do you have any
jobs open available?

669
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,714
I just got laid off.

670
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:38,150
- Oh honey, I'm so sorry.

671
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,520
I wish I had known.

672
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:42,821
Missy quit to go to Brooklyn,

673
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:45,591
and I just filled her
position this morning, so.

674
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:49,794
But people come and people
go, so I tell you what.

675
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:52,197
I'll let you know first
thing if something comes up.

676
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,031
All right?

677
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:53,966
- All right, thanks.

678
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,200
I'm willing to do anything.

679
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,635
- You keep your chin up,
and I'll check around.

680
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:58,506
- Thanks.

681
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:07,246
- Hey, Daddy, what are
you making for supper?

682
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:12,253
- Chicken, mashed
potatoes, and carrots.

683
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:16,355
- Yuck. I want spaghetti.

684
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:17,923
- Well, future gold medalists,

685
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:20,359
they ain't gonna
survive on no spaghetti.

686
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,562
Now get down from there.

687
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:28,867
Tania Agnes Devon, you are
trying daddy's patience.

688
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,102
Now for the last time,

689
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:32,873
quit messing around and
get off of that couch!

690
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:34,806
- Okay, Daddy.

691
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:36,310
But I gotta dismount.

692
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:47,685
- Tania.

693
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:48,587
Help!

694
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:49,488
Tania.

695
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,323
Tania. Tania.

696
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,157
Come on.

697
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,829
Tania, come on, baby.

698
00:39:57,831 --> 00:39:59,064
Come on, wake up.

699
00:39:59,066 --> 00:39:59,898
Come on, baby.

700
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,099
Come on.

701
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:16,148
- Oh my God!

702
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,316
- Somebody help!

703
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,587
- Please, somebody help us!

704
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:22,621
Oh my God!

705
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,393
Oh my God.

706
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:31,029
- Let's make a toast.

707
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:33,398
- What are we toasting?

708
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,570
- To the future, and to
all good things to come.

709
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,406
And to Deena and Rocket,

710
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:44,744
who met under the
strangest of circumstances.

711
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:57,889
- Is your real
name really Rocket?

712
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:58,692
- William.

713
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,526
I know, kind of boring.

714
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:03,397
- No, I mean, it's
rather digni...

715
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:05,530
Hey, what'd you do to your hand?

716
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:06,367
Oh my God.

717
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,405
- I was kind of
a klutz as a kid.

718
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,007
- A six year old girl has died

719
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:17,976
following a drive-by
shooting, officials said.

720
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:20,045
The victim, Tania
Devon, was found dead-

721
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,415
- Piece of shit.

722
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,484
Six years old.

723
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,552
- Around 6:30 PM.

724
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:28,522
- Do you know them?

725
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,993
- Wishbone and I
were friends as kids.

726
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,894
- What happened?

727
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:38,232
- Nothing. We both just
went our separate ways.

728
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:41,502
Neither one of them good.

729
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,105
- Ah, God, this makes me sick.

730
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:47,506
- I gotta get out of here.

731
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:48,309
Take care.

732
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,144
- I did speak
with the police chief

733
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:53,679
and she said that
there were no leads

734
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,714
and no suspects at this time,

735
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:57,983
and urged anyone who
witnessed the incident

736
00:41:57,985 --> 00:41:59,251
or has information,

737
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:02,220
to please contact
the department.

738
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,558
- Aggie, can you walk me home?

739
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,894
- Sure, baby.

740
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,129
- Thanks.

756
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,707
Vinny, where are you?

757
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,042
Oh, there you are. I
thought you were mad at me.

758
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:33,612
- Oh, greetings, my protege.

759
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,850
Why would you feel
I was disconcerted?

760
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,851
- I thought you might've
seen my magazine

761
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,421
about Renoir and got mad.

762
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:42,423
- Renoir.

763
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,026
There is no anger in
the ethereal world.

764
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:51,866
What is it that's bothering
you, my confidant?

765
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,169
- I feel so ashamed.

766
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:57,671
- What is it that shames you?

767
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,272
- I didn't do anything.

768
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:03,041
I just feel stupid
because I cry a lot.

769
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,476
Men shouldn't cry.

770
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,410
- Ah.

771
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:07,245
There's no shame in emotions.

772
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:09,281
That's what the creations
of the greatest artists

773
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:10,582
are born of.

774
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:11,752
- I guess you're right.

775
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:25,797
I don't get why somebody
would do that, Aggie.

776
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,568
You shouldn't do
nothing to nobody.

777
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:29,703
- I know, baby.

778
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:33,305
But, well...

779
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:35,106
It's just a damn
shame when someone

780
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:37,578
has to pay for the
sins of their father's.

781
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:41,648
- You mean Wishbone?

782
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:43,617
- Oh, no, no.

783
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,386
There's an old saying.

784
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:51,990
"Things that happen now
started a long time ago."

785
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:55,093
You know, things that
got a hold on people.

786
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:58,663
And well, it's very complicated.

787
00:44:58,665 --> 00:45:00,532
- Nothing should be
complicated enough

788
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:01,901
to kill a little girl.

789
00:45:01,903 --> 00:45:04,204
Any asshole should be
able to figure that out.

790
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:06,673
- I know, baby. I know.

791
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:10,175
- Aggie.

792
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:10,979
- Hm?

793
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:14,679
- Do you keep things
locked up around here?

794
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:15,516
Your door?

795
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,783
Do you keep that
locked up at night?

796
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:20,485
- Of course.

797
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:22,122
Are you worried about me?

798
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,527
Justin, I want you
to listen to me.

799
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,696
I've lived here my
whole adult life.

800
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:37,204
It's never been a very nice
neighborhood, but it's my home.

801
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:41,775
Nobody bothered me then,
nobody bothers me now.

802
00:45:43,176 --> 00:45:45,677
I'm just an old woman with
a house full of things

803
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,048
that mean nothing
to nobody but me.

804
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,284
And I refuse to be
afraid of the men

805
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,986
who were little boys I love.

806
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:55,453
Okay?

807
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,430
I got something for ya.

808
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,704
I remembered that you love
nostalgia and old photos.

809
00:46:12,706 --> 00:46:15,910
And I ran across
these the other day.

810
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,699
- Is this you?

811
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:42,169
- It sure is.

812
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:44,271
- Wow.

813
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,372
How long ago was this?

814
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:51,010
- Oh, it was many,
many years ago.

815
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:52,746
I was 18 years old.

816
00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:00,354
That's a scene from an off
Broadway play in New York City.

817
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:06,859
I was a member of Gabby's Girls.

818
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:10,528
The only African American
gal in the bunch.

819
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,365
Mhm.

820
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,834
- How long were you a dancer?

821
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,136
- Well, not long.

822
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:21,408
The love of a man took
over the love of dance.

823
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,978
- How were the white ladies?

824
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,212
Were they nice?

825
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:29,917
- Well, they were
very nice at first.

826
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,189
I was the underdog, and they
took me up under their wings.

827
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,526
They were sweet as pie,

828
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:44,065
until they found out
how well I could dance.

829
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:47,532
And then I became one
of them colored bitches,

830
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,200
among other things.

831
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,006
- Tyson's at the park.

832
00:48:27,008 --> 00:48:28,174
- He there right now?

833
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:29,141
- Right now.
- Yeah, right now?

834
00:48:29,143 --> 00:48:30,208
- Come on, man.
- Let's go.

835
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,611
- Get outta here, you punks.

836
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:34,713
Wishbone.

837
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:35,948
Don't do it, man.

838
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,649
Don't do it.

839
00:48:37,651 --> 00:48:39,120
Remember what the man said?

840
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:41,519
If you're gonna go
looking for revenge,

841
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:43,788
you better dig two graves.

842
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,524
Do not make things worse
than they already are.

843
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:49,895
- How can anything be
worse than it already is?

844
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:51,362
Huh?

845
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:55,467
In three days, I got family
flying in from New York.

846
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,701
And guess what?

847
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:58,906
It ain't gon' be
no family reunion.

848
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:04,946
I'm burying my beautiful
six year old baby girl,

849
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,179
who never did one damn thing,

850
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:10,648
except for try to bring
joy to everyone she met.

851
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,851
She was trying-
- Look, Wishbone.

852
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:12,818
Wishbone, look.

853
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,653
Listen to me.

854
00:49:14,956 --> 00:49:16,788
Look, I can't even
pretend to understand

855
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,857
what you're feeling right now.

856
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:19,060
- You got that right.

857
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,097
And I hope you never
do know how that feels.

858
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:25,597
- Don't do it.

859
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,899
Wishbone!

860
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:28,102
Wishbone, don't do it!

861
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:38,212
- There's
nothing but crap in here.

862
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,280
- There's plenty of
canned stuff in there.

863
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:43,818
You can microwave something.

864
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,188
- That's all crap too.

865
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,421
God, Mom.

866
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,258
It's like you don't
even give a shit.

867
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,962
- Sometimes you make it
hard to give a shit, Justin.

868
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:57,695
- What are you
doing there anyway?

869
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,731
- I'm trying to pay the bills.

870
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:00,567
- What?

871
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:04,704
- Sit down. I want to talk
to you about something.

872
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:07,407
Come on, sit down.

873
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:17,850
As soon as I get a job,

874
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:20,986
I'm gonna be working
a lot of overtime.

875
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:22,487
- Why?

876
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,926
- I wanna save
as much money as I can.

877
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,791
- Why?

878
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:27,962
What are you gonna buy?

879
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,598
- I'm not gonna
buy anything, Justin.

880
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,900
As soon as I can get
a little bit ahead,

881
00:50:34,902 --> 00:50:36,235
we're gonna pack up the truck,

882
00:50:36,237 --> 00:50:38,938
and we're getting
the hell outta here.

883
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,606
- Well, maybe you are,
but I'm staying here.

884
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:42,774
- Justin.

885
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:44,944
You don't even like it here.

886
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:46,444
I mean, we could go anywhere.

887
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:49,148
We could go somewhere warm
somewhere, somewhere peaceful.

888
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,749
Some nice little town somewhere.

889
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:53,753
- I said I'm not going anywhere!

890
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:56,756
- Justin.

891
00:50:57,992 --> 00:50:59,291
- I'll just
go live with Aggie.

892
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:01,626
- Justin. I know
that you're mad,

893
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:04,196
but you can't live with Aggie.

894
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:06,332
Aggie is an eccentrical lady.

895
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:08,733
You can't live with her
the rest of your life.

896
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:11,303
You know, watching old
movies and listening to jazz

897
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:13,873
and having her give you the
gossip of the neighborhood.

898
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,708
That's another reason why
I think we should leave.

899
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,143
- That "eccentric old
lady" as you call her

900
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:21,013
happens to have more
class in her little finger

901
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:23,481
than you'll ever have
in your entire body.

902
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:24,682
Oh, what's that?

903
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:25,918
You wanna leave off
for another town

904
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,621
'cause you used up all
the men in this one?

905
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:33,194
- Justin! Justin!

906
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:44,469
Oh my God, his inhaler.

907
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:45,840
Shit, shit, shit.

908
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:55,814
Shit.

909
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:57,051
Oh, come on, damn it, come on!

910
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:00,286
Shit.

911
00:52:04,225 --> 00:52:05,059
Um...

912
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:09,328
Oh, come on, Maria.

913
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,464
Come on, pick up, pick up.

914
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,001
Shit.

915
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,535
My God.

916
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:13,025
- You know after
she put it down,

917
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:14,460
I gotta go back.

918
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:16,295
I gotta go back.

919
00:53:16,297 --> 00:53:17,329
- Get over here, you...

920
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:18,831
- Get off of him!

921
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,466
Let's go!

922
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:22,336
- We had this huge
blowout, you know.

923
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:25,371
But he's out there
all alone in the dark,

924
00:53:25,373 --> 00:53:27,039
and he didn't take his inhaler!

925
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:27,973
- Deena.

926
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:29,408
He just went to cool off, okay?

927
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,909
That's what kids do.

928
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:32,277
He'll calm down and come back
like nothing ever happened.

929
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,979
- No, no, this was different.

930
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:36,215
You know, this wasn't
just a little tiff.

931
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:37,816
You know, I wanna call the cops,

932
00:53:37,818 --> 00:53:39,385
but he hasn't been
gone long enough.

933
00:53:39,387 --> 00:53:41,120
- Look, look, look,
we'll find him, okay?

934
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:42,488
I won't leave until we do.

935
00:53:57,438 --> 00:54:00,007
- Put the knife down!

936
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,809
- Oh my God, over there!

937
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:06,345
No, a little closer!
Please, pull up.

938
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:07,545
- Deena.

939
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:09,050
- No, something may
have happened to my kid!

940
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,054
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

941
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:16,255
- No, let go of me!

942
00:54:16,257 --> 00:54:17,322
- Wait.

943
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:18,257
- Justin?

944
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,091
- Deena!

945
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:20,459
- Justin?

946
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,295
Justin!

947
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,370
- Need a 52, code two,
for a stabbing victim.

948
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:33,939
- So that was your
friend? Wishbone?

949
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,941
- Childhood friend, yeah.

950
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,812
- Oh my God, his little girl.

951
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:41,447
- Stellie should've
kept her mouth shut.

952
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:42,780
- Stellie?

953
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,551
- Yeah, Wishbone's
wife, ex-wife.

954
00:54:45,553 --> 00:54:46,586
- I don't understand.

955
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:50,923
- His little girl, that
was a message to Stellie.

956
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,858
- What are you talking about?

957
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,761
- In my line of work,
you hear things.

958
00:54:56,163 --> 00:54:59,764
Sonny is the pulse of
the grapevine, nosy shit.

959
00:54:59,766 --> 00:55:02,267
He tells me things that
I'd rather not hear.

960
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:05,270
- Look, I still don't get
what you're talking about.

961
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:06,771
- Stellie got pitched.

962
00:55:06,773 --> 00:55:08,974
They had her on drugs, dealing.

963
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:10,775
She was gonna go
away for a long time,

964
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:13,247
unless she started naming
names, and she did.

965
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:17,282
- Why didn't they go
after her? Why her kid?

966
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:18,517
- When she disappeared,

967
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,185
every Tom, Dick and
Harry in this town

968
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:22,955
knew she was somewhere
running her mouth.

969
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:24,490
- But what do you mean
running her mouth?

970
00:55:24,492 --> 00:55:27,493
I mean, yeah, she was
trying to save her own ass,

971
00:55:27,495 --> 00:55:29,161
but she was doing some
good for the neighborhood

972
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:31,196
by turning in those
pieces of shit.

973
00:55:31,198 --> 00:55:33,031
- You don't turn
on your own, Deena.

974
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:34,299
- You sound like
you're defending them.

975
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:35,501
- I'm not defending them.

976
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:36,570
I'm not.

977
00:55:37,938 --> 00:55:40,307
It's not right, but
that's just the way it is.

978
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,198
Deena, hey, hey, hey-

979
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,032
- What? What?
- Hey, hey.

980
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:08,100
- No, I hear his music.

981
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:08,934
I think he's home.

982
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:09,868
- Okay, he's home.

983
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:10,905
He's safe.

984
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:22,780
- Justin.

985
00:56:22,782 --> 00:56:24,283
Justin, are you okay?

986
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:25,685
- What do you care?

987
00:56:30,391 --> 00:56:31,225
- Hey, buddy.

988
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:34,962
My name's William. My
friends call me Rocket.

989
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:38,798
Listen.

990
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,134
Why don't you open
the door, let us in,

991
00:56:42,136 --> 00:56:43,204
see that you're okay.

992
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:46,507
Or I could come in.

993
00:56:47,707 --> 00:56:50,842
You know, we could
talk, man to man.

994
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:51,843
- If I let you in,

995
00:56:51,845 --> 00:56:52,811
there would only
be one man here,

996
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,181
and his name is Justin.

997
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:56,783
- What'd I tell you?

998
00:56:57,918 --> 00:56:59,553
Kids love me, I know
we'd hit it off.

999
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:02,521
- You know what?

1000
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:04,022
Don't even worry about it.

1001
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:06,493
He's just gonna get himself
all worked up all over again.

1002
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:10,763
Okay, Justin.

1003
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,366
I'll leave you be,

1004
00:57:14,368 --> 00:57:15,936
and we can talk in
the morning, okay?

1005
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:19,974
All right, good night.

1006
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:22,307
- I'll stick around for
a little bit, all right?

1007
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,577
Make sure he doesn't jet.

1008
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:25,611
- Okay.

1009
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:27,145
Yeah, thanks.

1010
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:28,981
- Of course.

1011
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:45,032
- You know, you
get a phone call.

1012
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,401
- I know the drill.

1013
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,471
Won't be necessary.

1014
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:52,973
- Suit yourself.

1015
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:28,108
- So I'm 17, homeless,
sleeping under bridges.

1016
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:37,983
I get a job as a dishwasher,
cook, some shithole bar.

1017
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:39,219
That's when I meet Sonny.

1018
00:58:40,954 --> 00:58:42,923
Tells me he's in
the movie business,

1019
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:46,760
asks me what I'm doing wasting
my time in a place like this.

1020
00:58:49,263 --> 00:58:51,665
Says he needs editors,
screenwriters, cameramen.

1021
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:56,070
I was just some dipshit
kid, I bought it.

1022
00:58:58,672 --> 00:58:59,971
- So, what happened?

1023
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:02,574
You know, when you
got started at 17.

1024
00:59:02,576 --> 00:59:04,710
- I mean, he was real
slick at first, you know.

1025
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:07,612
Had me running errands,
shit like that.

1026
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:09,681
I didn't know what was going on.

1027
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:10,751
Ah, that was stupid.

1028
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,087
- So when did you, you know,

1029
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:18,190
realize what he
was really doing?

1030
00:59:18,192 --> 00:59:20,359
- I think deep down inside,
I kinda always knew.

1031
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:21,293
- Sure.

1032
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:24,963
- For my 18th birthday,

1033
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:27,868
he had a woman come
over to my apartment.

1034
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,370
- Oh, geez.

1035
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:33,407
- Yeah.

1036
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:41,415
- So here I am, older,
not a whole lot wiser.

1037
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,276
- Vinny, I'm
surprised to see you.

1038
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,245
I haven't called for you.

1039
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:15,382
- I sensed some angst.

1040
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,185
Could I perhaps be
of some comfort?

1041
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,286
- Well, do you
know what happened?

1042
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:22,554
- Alas, no.

1043
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:25,125
I can only see into your
life if you allow me to.

1044
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:30,197
A disgruntled artist.

1045
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:33,432
You should tell yourself...

1046
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:36,334
"I'm seeking, I'm striving,

1047
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:38,203
and I mean with all my heart."

1048
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:39,504
- Well, it's not that easy.

1049
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:40,907
I'm trying to
remember something,

1050
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:42,576
and it's too bad to talk about.

1051
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:44,511
But I can tell you.

1052
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,080
- So you write screenplays?

1053
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:49,183
- Yeah.

1054
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:51,950
Even had the nerve to
show one to someone.

1055
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:52,919
- Yeah?

1056
01:00:52,921 --> 01:00:53,720
- Yeah.

1057
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:55,989
He said he was "blown away".

1058
01:00:57,391 --> 01:01:00,025
He said he was gonna
change gears for a while.

1059
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:02,727
Produce something
reputable for a change.

1060
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:04,329
Said he'd use my script.

1061
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:05,165
- So did he?

1062
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:08,500
- Yeah.

1063
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:11,670
He calls me, tells me he's
got a surprise for me.

1064
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:12,539
It's my script.

1065
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:16,811
Now what I wrote was PG, okay?

1066
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:21,613
Sonny sends me over some
moaning, groaning sex fest.

1067
01:01:21,615 --> 01:01:23,148
- Oh.

1068
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,785
- With a little bit of my
dialogue sprinkled on top.

1069
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,123
Jesus Christ.

1070
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:33,458
I can't believe I ever
thought that sleazy bastard

1071
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,128
would produce
anything reputable.

1072
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,665
- Well, have you shown
your stuff to anyone else?

1073
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,334
- Who am I gonna show, Deena?

1074
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:43,535
I edit porn.

1075
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:44,804
Nobody's gonna
take me seriously.

1076
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:46,671
- I don't know. I
mean, I don't know.

1077
01:01:46,673 --> 01:01:50,511
I just have this feeling
like, you just never know.

1078
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:04,824
- It's getting kind of late.

1079
01:02:04,826 --> 01:02:05,724
- Yeah.
- I should get outta here.

1080
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:07,292
- Yeah, sure.

1081
01:02:07,294 --> 01:02:08,126
Thanks for the beer.

1082
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:08,963
- Yeah.

1083
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:12,163
- Take care.

1084
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:14,232
- See ya.

1085
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:15,736
- So, I don't know what to do.

1086
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:21,974
- Well, I wish I
could advise you,

1087
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,275
but I have little
knowledge of the workings

1088
01:02:23,277 --> 01:02:24,611
of the 21st century.

1089
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,515
First and foremost though,
there is self-preservation.

1090
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:34,586
- Well, I have to do something.

1091
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:39,027
- Well, remember what I told
you in our first encounter?

1092
01:02:40,862 --> 01:02:42,794
- What would life be if
we never had the courage

1093
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:43,764
to attend anything?

1094
01:02:45,632 --> 01:02:46,765
Hey, Mom?

1095
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:47,732
- Yeah.

1096
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:50,036
- Can you pick up newspapers?

1097
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:53,538
One of my assignments
is on current events.

1098
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,607
- The convenience store is
just a couple blocks down.

1099
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,043
You can walk down and get one.

1100
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:59,611
- But Mom-
- No, Justin, come on.

1101
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:00,545
Dr. James said
you that you were-

1102
01:03:00,547 --> 01:03:01,981
- Fine, I'll do it.

1103
01:03:01,983 --> 01:03:02,982
- You were supposed to be
getting out to do these things.

1104
01:03:02,984 --> 01:03:04,783
Here's a couple bucks.

1105
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,418
I'm gonna be out for a while,

1106
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,587
so you can go hang
out with Aggie.

1107
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:10,155
You guys can have a movie night.

1108
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:10,992
Bye.

1109
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:30,644
- All y'all knew.

1110
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:34,981
- Clarence
William Devon.

1111
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:37,515
You are here charged
with first degree murder

1112
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:39,417
in the death of Tyus Freemont.

1113
01:03:39,419 --> 01:03:40,287
How do you plead?

1114
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:43,323
- Guilty.

1115
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:05,677
- Aggie.

1116
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,479
Were you able to
dance like that?

1117
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:08,848
- I probably thought so.

1118
01:04:11,284 --> 01:04:14,452
Oh my goodness, look
what time it is.

1119
01:04:14,454 --> 01:04:17,722
It's my fault, I got you
caught up in this movie.

1120
01:04:17,724 --> 01:04:19,257
But you know what?

1121
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:22,496
We still got time for you to
do one of your assignments.

1122
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,136
- What did
daddy tell you about

1123
01:04:30,138 --> 01:04:31,338
climbing on that couch?

1124
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:35,273
- It's a
balance beam, Daddy.

1125
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:36,576
I'm gonna be a gymnast.

1126
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:41,883
- You said you
wanted to be an artist, right?

1127
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:44,618
- I want to do both.

1128
01:04:50,524 --> 01:04:51,358
- Aggie.

1129
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:55,295
- Hi, Justin.

1130
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:58,463
I'm sorry to wake you up.

1131
01:04:58,465 --> 01:04:59,731
You weren't in your room,

1132
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,635
so I was thinking
you might be here.

1133
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:05,470
I hope I didn't scare you.

1134
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:07,840
I know you've been
real, real sad.

1135
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:10,777
I just wanna stop by
and tell you I'm okay.

1136
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:16,748
Justin, can you please
do something for me?

1137
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,885
Can you please tell
my daddy I'm okay?

1138
01:05:19,887 --> 01:05:21,488
He's been real sad.

1139
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,091
- Do you think you can do it?

1140
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:26,160
That might be better.

1141
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:28,760
- I can't, Justin.

1142
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,163
My daddy doesn't believe
the same things as you.

1143
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,867
That's why it wouldn't work.

1144
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:34,967
- Oh.

1145
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:36,902
- My daddy sure did like
that picture you drew.

1146
01:05:36,904 --> 01:05:39,004
He told me if I kept practicing,

1147
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:42,007
I'd be as good as the
little boy in the park.

1148
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:45,343
He bought me an art box
like yours for my birthday.

1149
01:05:45,345 --> 01:05:47,947
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

1150
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:49,514
I found it.

1151
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:50,782
I snooped.

1152
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,686
I'd be real happy
if you'd tell him.

1153
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,854
- Okay.

1154
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:56,188
- But don't tell him
I found that art box,

1155
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:58,790
he'd get mad at me
'cause I was so nosy.

1156
01:05:58,792 --> 01:05:59,724
- I won't.

1157
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:00,860
- One time Daddy told me,

1158
01:06:00,862 --> 01:06:02,360
"Tania Agnes Devon.

1159
01:06:02,362 --> 01:06:03,661
You may be only six years old,

1160
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:06,666
but you're the nosiest
woman I ever did know."

1161
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:11,402
- Tania, are you happy?

1162
01:06:11,404 --> 01:06:14,541
- Mostly, but I'm
sad about my daddy.

1163
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:18,944
I'd be real happy if
he knows I'm all right.

1164
01:06:18,946 --> 01:06:19,780
- Okay.

1165
01:06:30,124 --> 01:06:30,956
Vinny?

1166
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,390
- Greetings!

1167
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:33,525
- I need to ask you something,
it's gonna sound stupid.

1168
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:34,592
- Well, the only
unintelligent question-

1169
01:06:34,594 --> 01:06:35,727
- Are you real?

1170
01:06:35,729 --> 01:06:36,996
- Of course I'm real.

1171
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:38,998
Why would you think otherwise?

1172
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,532
- I was reading up
on schizophrenia.

1173
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:43,269
"A person hears voices and
sometimes sees things."

1174
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:46,771
And I saw the little girl,
the one that got shot.

1175
01:06:46,773 --> 01:06:48,439
She seemed so real.

1176
01:06:48,441 --> 01:06:50,708
- Do you doubt
that she was real?

1177
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,378
- No, that's the point.

1178
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,981
Schizophrenics believe
what they see and hear.

1179
01:06:55,983 --> 01:06:58,986
I read about it in the issue
of the 21st Century Psychology.

1180
01:07:00,453 --> 01:07:02,957
Maybe I'm just sitting
here talking to myself.

1181
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:05,358
I'm getting scared.

1182
01:07:08,062 --> 01:07:11,263
I also read that voices
are really nice at first.

1183
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:12,298
I don't know what to do.

1184
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,835
I don't wanna be crazy.

1185
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:22,977
- These people,
voices that you hear.

1186
01:07:24,045 --> 01:07:24,879
Are they kind?

1187
01:07:25,779 --> 01:07:27,745
- Yeah, they're really nice.

1188
01:07:27,747 --> 01:07:29,716
But that's how it starts.

1189
01:07:31,585 --> 01:07:33,787
- You have opened your
heart, Master Justin.

1190
01:07:34,956 --> 01:07:36,889
Once you do that, you
open yourself to visits

1191
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:39,526
from all kinds of
kindred spirits.

1192
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:42,063
They'll always be kind.

1193
01:07:43,264 --> 01:07:45,599
They won't visit you if
you don't want them to.

1194
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:49,534
If you are truly mad, they
would continue to come,

1195
01:07:49,536 --> 01:07:51,438
whether you wanted
them to or not.

1196
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:53,673
- I just hope I'm not crazy.

1197
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:56,976
- Mm.

1198
01:07:56,978 --> 01:08:01,648
I thought as you did, my
protege, that I was mad.

1199
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:07,822
But after my demise, I
realized I was not mad at all.

1200
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:11,625
It was the world
around me that was mad.

1201
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:15,162
Does that make sense?

1202
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:20,732
You're probably too youthful
to understand right now,

1203
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:23,703
but you will someday.

1204
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:29,074
- I'll be back in a minute.

1205
01:08:29,076 --> 01:08:31,509
Might be a little longer
than that if Rosa's working.

1206
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:35,180
You know, she can talk
a person's ear off.

1207
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:36,017
- Okay.

1208
01:08:57,838 --> 01:08:58,672
Aggie?

1209
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,311
Aggie.

1210
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:10,615
Hello?

1211
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:12,550
- Aggie, it's Wishbone.

1212
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:13,584
- Hey, Wishbone.

1213
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:14,754
It's Justin Travers.

1214
01:09:16,324 --> 01:09:17,455
- Oh, I thought I called-

1215
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:18,656
- This is Aggie's house.

1216
01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:19,927
You met me in the park.

1217
01:09:21,095 --> 01:09:23,128
Aggie went to go
get some coffee.

1218
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:25,763
I can talk to you
until she gets back.

1219
01:09:25,765 --> 01:09:28,135
- Justin? The little
boy from the park?

1220
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,269
The artist?

1221
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:31,339
- That's me.

1222
01:09:32,873 --> 01:09:34,605
- How you been, buddy?

1223
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:37,244
- I'm good. Aggie's helping
me with my math homework.

1224
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:39,280
- Oh, I see.

1225
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,515
Well, I don't have
much time to talk.

1226
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:47,386
You draw any more masterpieces?

1227
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:50,022
- Yeah, I'm working
on something now.

1228
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:51,725
It's taking me a
really long time.

1229
01:09:52,893 --> 01:09:55,060
- I'm sure whatever it
is, it will be awesome.

1230
01:09:55,062 --> 01:09:56,428
- I hope so.

1231
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:59,031
I'm thinking about
entering it into a contest.

1232
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,033
- Well, I know if I was a judge,

1233
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:03,501
I know you'd get my vote.

1234
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:04,338
- Thanks.

1235
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:11,410
I wanna tell you something,
but I don't know if I should.

1236
01:10:11,412 --> 01:10:15,182
- You can tell me
anything, buddies for life.

1237
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,017
- I saw Tania.

1238
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:19,885
- You mean that day at the park?

1239
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:22,087
- No, she really
came to talk to me.

1240
01:10:22,089 --> 01:10:24,392
She wanted me to let you
know that she's al right.

1241
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:33,866
- You mean you had a
dream about Tania, huh?

1242
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,134
- No.

1243
01:10:35,136 --> 01:10:36,303
Or, kind of.

1244
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:40,406
I really saw her.

1245
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:41,442
Don't you believe me?

1246
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:47,413
- Yeah, look, I
believe you buddy.

1247
01:10:47,415 --> 01:10:49,081
But it was just a dream.

1248
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:50,916
A vivid dream.

1249
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:55,888
Hey, I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better.

1250
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,655
- I wasn't supposed
to tell you something,

1251
01:10:57,657 --> 01:11:00,259
I promised, but...

1252
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:00,995
- What's that?

1253
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:05,763
- You bought her an art box
just like mine for her birthday.

1254
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:07,266
You said if she
practiced real hard,

1255
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:09,904
she'd become as good as the
little boy in the park someday.

1256
01:11:17,044 --> 01:11:18,077
Wishbone?

1257
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:19,080
Are you still there?

1258
01:11:23,484 --> 01:11:25,716
- Hey, look buddy, I gotta go.

1259
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,953
You tell Aggie I said thank
you for letting me add her

1260
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,054
to my call list.

1261
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,291
And you take care, okay?

1262
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:55,916
- What?

1263
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,535
- What is up, little man?

1264
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:17,469
How you doin'?

1265
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:19,404
All right. Good to see ya.

1266
01:12:19,406 --> 01:12:20,839
- My mom needs smokes, sir.

1267
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:22,640
- Yeah, she just called.

1268
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,443
I'll get 'em to you on the sly.

1269
01:12:24,445 --> 01:12:26,677
I don't wanna get my ass
in a jam with anybody.

1270
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:28,015
Now, come have a seat.

1271
01:12:28,883 --> 01:12:30,050
You tell me what's new.

1272
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:34,453
- Not much, school lessons.

1273
01:12:34,455 --> 01:12:35,720
Mom nagging me.

1274
01:12:35,722 --> 01:12:36,524
Whatever.

1275
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:39,324
- You be good to your mama.

1276
01:12:39,326 --> 01:12:40,327
She's good people.

1277
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:42,229
Hey.

1278
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:46,899
I usually save those
for happy hour,

1279
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,768
but this is a special occasion.

1280
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:51,036
Hey, can we get another round?

1281
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:51,972
- Yep, I'm there.

1282
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:06,552
- What?

1283
01:13:06,554 --> 01:13:08,086
- Deena?

1284
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:09,754
- Hey.

1285
01:13:09,756 --> 01:13:10,989
- Something wrong?

1286
01:13:10,991 --> 01:13:12,891
- Oh, no. You know,
it's just Justin.

1287
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,627
I mean, sometimes I
think he's a lost cause.

1288
01:13:15,629 --> 01:13:16,931
I don't wanna get into it.

1289
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:19,732
What's up?

1290
01:13:21,035 --> 01:13:22,434
- I was just
thinking about you.

1291
01:13:22,436 --> 01:13:24,471
I was wondering if you
might wanna hang out.

1292
01:13:26,273 --> 01:13:27,539
- Sure.

1293
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,107
Yeah, when?

1294
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:31,742
- I'm at work,
but I'll be home in a bit.

1295
01:13:31,744 --> 01:13:34,279
You can go over, hang out and
wait for me if you want to.

1296
01:13:34,281 --> 01:13:37,082
My keys are in the
bottom of the mailbox.

1297
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:38,417
Bring Justin.

1298
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,785
- Yeah, right.

1299
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:42,787
What are we gonna do? Make
popcorn and watch movies?

1300
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:44,022
- Sure.

1301
01:13:44,024 --> 01:13:45,224
Didn't you say he
likes the old stuff?

1302
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:46,058
I got a bunch.

1303
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,962
Cagney, Stewart, Grant.

1304
01:13:50,664 --> 01:13:52,898
- Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.

1305
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,235
I'll see you there.

1306
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:58,237
- Wanna do the
dishes before I get home?

1307
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,905
- Not funny.

1308
01:13:59,907 --> 01:14:01,206
- It was a joke, Deena.

1309
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,709
I gotta run, but I'll
see you guys soon.

1310
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:06,378
- Okay, I'll see you later.

1311
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,214
Bye.

1312
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:30,770
Hello?

1313
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:32,738
Yeah.

1314
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,641
Hi, Maria.

1315
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,174
No.

1316
01:14:36,176 --> 01:14:39,013
Yeah, how's life been treating
you since the big layoffs?

1317
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:41,015
What?

1318
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,485
No, I never heard of it.

1319
01:14:46,553 --> 01:14:47,388
When?

1320
01:14:49,056 --> 01:14:51,923
Yeah, I mean, that sounds great.

1321
01:14:51,925 --> 01:14:53,725
Yeah, I mean...

1322
01:14:53,727 --> 01:14:56,528
Yeah, maybe we could
share a place or...

1323
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,398
Yeah, until we get
enough money saved,

1324
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,267
or yeah, until we
drive each other crazy.

1325
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:03,468
Yeah, that could work too.

1326
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:06,938
Okay.

1327
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,341
Well look, I'm gonna
head out for a bit,

1328
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:11,476
but can I call you
back in a while?

1329
01:15:11,478 --> 01:15:13,145
Okay, sounds good.

1330
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:13,979
All right.

1331
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,715
Hey, Maria, thank you.

1332
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:17,718
Okay, bye.

1333
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:23,724
- Whoa.

1334
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,224
When'd you get this?

1335
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:28,427
- Ah, a couple weeks ago.

1336
01:15:28,429 --> 01:15:30,662
When Rudy's Bar closed down.

1337
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:34,833
Ah.

1338
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:38,570
Is this a red
letter day or what?

1339
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:41,606
Martavious King, you get
your ragged ass over here,

1340
01:15:41,608 --> 01:15:43,475
and give your
god-daddy a big hug.

1341
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:46,813
All right.

1342
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,347
Hey.

1343
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,749
What's this that I have to
learn through the grapevine

1344
01:15:50,751 --> 01:15:52,084
that you're gonna be a daddy?

1345
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,186
- I'm sorry.

1346
01:15:54,188 --> 01:15:55,320
I've been meaning
to stop by though.

1347
01:15:55,322 --> 01:15:56,688
- Oh, sure.

1348
01:15:57,524 --> 01:16:00,392
Hey, sit down.

1349
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:01,328
- What's up?

1350
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:04,429
- What's this all
about Wishbone?

1351
01:16:04,431 --> 01:16:07,165
Do you know anything?
I'm just sick about him.

1352
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:07,999
It's really sick.

1353
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:08,837
- I don't know.

1354
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:42,033
- Hello.

1355
01:16:42,035 --> 01:16:44,403
You've reached Aggie Langford.

1356
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:46,638
I can't take your
call right now.

1357
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,874
Please leave a message,

1358
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:49,910
and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can.

1359
01:16:51,578 --> 01:16:53,545
- Hey Aggie, it's me.

1360
01:16:53,547 --> 01:16:55,347
As soon as you get this,
could you please come over?

1361
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,450
It's really important.

1362
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:51,403
- So you know after she put
it down, I gotta go back.

1363
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:53,405
I gotta go back.

1364
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:54,239
- Get over here.

1365
01:17:54,241 --> 01:17:55,707
- Get off of him!

1366
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:56,543
Let's go!

1367
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:03,715
Get up! Let's go!

1368
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:04,886
Come on, baby.

1369
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:09,089
- Yeah! Yeah!

1370
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,523
Yeah, boy!

1371
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:12,624
What you doin'?

1372
01:18:12,626 --> 01:18:14,059
Come on, man.

1373
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:16,461
Devon, we gotta go, man!

1374
01:19:24,866 --> 01:19:26,231
- Aggie.

1375
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:31,238
Aggie!

1376
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,106
Aggie!

1377
01:19:44,318 --> 01:19:45,152
Aggie?

1378
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:49,323
Aggie?

1379
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,246
- It was my time to go.

1380
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:49,083
Not yours, baby.

1381
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,416
- Please wake up, Justin.

1382
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:54,552
You're the only one
that can help my daddy.

1383
01:20:54,554 --> 01:20:58,358
- In spite of everything,
I will rise again.

1384
01:21:00,327 --> 01:21:01,559
- 9-1-1.

1385
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:02,627
What is the address
of your emergency?

1386
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:04,132
- It's Dowling Street.

1387
01:21:05,265 --> 01:21:06,498
- What's
going on, ma'am?

1388
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,768
- It's a little boy,
and he's unconscious.

1389
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:12,270
It's Mrs. Gladys, I'm
his next door neighbor.

1390
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,339
- Is he
breathing, ma'am?

1391
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:16,374
- I don't think so.

1392
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:17,342
Justin.

1393
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:18,911
Justin.

1394
01:21:18,913 --> 01:21:20,178
Come on, stay with me, buddy.

1395
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,981
Come on.

1396
01:21:43,905 --> 01:21:45,704
- Sorry, I was
running a little late.

1397
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:47,708
I see you found the
spare keys all right.

1398
01:21:49,776 --> 01:21:52,080
What the hell are you doing?

1399
01:21:54,681 --> 01:21:55,881
You going through my shit?

1400
01:21:55,883 --> 01:21:57,149
- I'm sorry.

1401
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:59,020
I'm sorry, I was
waiting here for you,

1402
01:22:00,154 --> 01:22:01,386
and you didn't show up,

1403
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:02,654
and I started reading,
and I couldn't stop.

1404
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:03,790
I couldn't put it down.

1405
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,594
William.

1406
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:10,096
You're so good.
- Stop.

1407
01:22:10,098 --> 01:22:11,262
- You're so damn good.

1408
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:13,498
You should be submitting
this to something.

1409
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,301
- Stop.

1410
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:20,906
Oh.

1411
01:22:20,908 --> 01:22:21,742
Oh.

1412
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:26,480
The little boy.

1413
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:30,218
That was you.

1414
01:22:31,752 --> 01:22:33,052
- So what, you know me now?

1415
01:22:33,054 --> 01:22:33,888
- No.

1416
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:39,760
- You don't know shit, Deena.

1417
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:30,777
- Hello?

1418
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:35,981
Oh my God.

1419
01:23:35,983 --> 01:23:37,682
No, no, I will be right there.

1420
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:39,317
I'll be right there, thank you.

1421
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:40,451
Okay, thank you, bye.

1422
01:23:40,453 --> 01:23:41,653
- What's wrong?

1423
01:23:41,655 --> 01:23:43,655
- It's Justin. He's
in the hospital.

1424
01:23:43,657 --> 01:23:45,059
- Come on, I'll go with you.

1425
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:05,213
- Hey.

1426
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,315
How you feelin'?

1427
01:24:15,689 --> 01:24:17,189
Mrs. Layton is here.

1428
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:18,991
She brought this for you.

1429
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:20,826
They're pictures of Aggie.

1430
01:24:20,828 --> 01:24:22,794
- I know what it is.

1431
01:24:22,796 --> 01:24:23,630
- Okay.

1432
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:29,969
I have to go out and just
run a couple errands.

1433
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:31,469
She's gonna stay.

1434
01:24:31,471 --> 01:24:32,637
She'll be downstairs if
you should need anything.

1435
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:33,906
Okay?

1436
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:35,473
- I don't
need a babysitter.

1437
01:24:35,475 --> 01:24:37,009
- Justin, I know.

1438
01:24:37,011 --> 01:24:39,845
But you just got out of the
hospital a couple days ago.

1439
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:41,681
So she's here just
in case, okay?

1440
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:44,216
- Fine.

1441
01:24:44,218 --> 01:24:45,416
- I won't be gone long.

1442
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:47,554
I'll be back to help
you with your nebulizer.

1443
01:24:49,623 --> 01:24:50,457
Okay.

1444
01:25:10,144 --> 01:25:12,177
And I don't know how I'm
gonna tell him, Gladys.

1445
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:15,147
I mean, this is just a bad
time to pull up and leave.

1446
01:25:15,149 --> 01:25:18,117
But I have to work,
and it's decent money.

1447
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:21,120
- Hey, hey, don't worry.

1448
01:25:21,122 --> 01:25:22,187
Okay?

1449
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,524
He is a strong little boy.

1450
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:26,691
He is.

1451
01:25:26,693 --> 01:25:30,595
- You know, he
loved Aggie so much.

1452
01:25:30,597 --> 01:25:31,964
You know, I loved her too.

1453
01:25:31,966 --> 01:25:33,866
I mean, I never
even told her that.

1454
01:25:33,868 --> 01:25:35,667
Do you know I never
even said thank you

1455
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:37,303
after everything she did for us?

1456
01:25:37,305 --> 01:25:38,137
- Oh, come on.

1457
01:25:38,139 --> 01:25:39,805
She knew.

1458
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:41,943
And she knew what it
was like to struggle.

1459
01:25:42,877 --> 01:25:43,710
She knew.

1460
01:27:18,139 --> 01:27:19,171
- Yeah?

1461
01:27:19,173 --> 01:27:20,538
- Martavious King?

1462
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:21,375
- That's me.

1463
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:25,146
- Can we come in? Ask
you a few questions?

1464
01:27:26,113 --> 01:27:27,946
- About what?

1465
01:27:27,948 --> 01:27:28,883
- Clarence Devon.

1466
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:31,950
- What about him?

1467
01:27:31,952 --> 01:27:33,452
- He's-

1468
01:27:33,454 --> 01:27:36,255
- Well, he's run into some
unfortunate legal problems,

1469
01:27:36,257 --> 01:27:39,191
and we thought that maybe you
could give us some insight.

1470
01:27:39,193 --> 01:27:40,893
We'd like you to come
down to the station.

1471
01:27:40,895 --> 01:27:42,895
Just ask you a few questions,

1472
01:27:42,897 --> 01:27:44,063
you're not in any trouble.

1473
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:45,531
- Listen, listen.

1474
01:27:45,533 --> 01:27:48,467
Without a search warrant,
you are not coming in.

1475
01:27:48,469 --> 01:27:51,904
And without an arrest
warrant, I'm not coming out.

1476
01:27:51,906 --> 01:27:53,374
Have a good day.

1477
01:28:08,989 --> 01:28:09,824
- Mr. Justin.

1478
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:12,091
- Hi, Wishbone.

1479
01:28:12,093 --> 01:28:13,658
I hope you are okay.

1480
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:14,993
I'm fine.

1481
01:28:14,995 --> 01:28:17,062
We're moving in a few days.

1482
01:28:17,064 --> 01:28:18,596
We're going to California.

1483
01:28:18,598 --> 01:28:21,599
The factory my mom works at
is starting a new one there.

1484
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:23,302
I'll send you my new address,

1485
01:28:23,304 --> 01:28:25,304
and we can be pen
pals if you want.

1486
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:26,538
I drew a picture for you,

1487
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,739
and I hope it makes
you happy and not sad.

1488
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:30,509
It's from the day
we met in the park.

1489
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:32,610
Your friend, Justin Travers.

1490
01:28:54,602 --> 01:28:55,834
- Hey, David.

1491
01:28:55,836 --> 01:28:57,936
Would you like to
go to lunch with...

1492
01:28:57,938 --> 01:29:00,705
Oh my goodness.

1493
01:29:00,707 --> 01:29:02,241
When did you that?

1494
01:29:02,243 --> 01:29:03,741
This afternoon.

1495
01:29:03,743 --> 01:29:05,643
It was a gift from one
of my younger patients

1496
01:29:05,645 --> 01:29:06,947
after our last session.

1497
01:29:08,482 --> 01:29:10,449
He painted it himself.

1498
01:29:10,451 --> 01:29:13,452
Looks like one of those Vincent
van Goghs you love so much.

1499
01:29:13,454 --> 01:29:14,987
- Right?

1500
01:29:14,989 --> 01:29:17,589
It was for a thing called
the Van Gogh Challenge.

1501
01:29:17,591 --> 01:29:20,959
Each one of the entrants
had to do their own version

1502
01:29:20,961 --> 01:29:23,364
of a Van Gogh painting
and rename it.

1503
01:29:24,764 --> 01:29:29,134
He chose the Starry Night
and called it Charcoal Skies.

1504
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:29,970
- Did he win?

1505
01:29:32,306 --> 01:29:33,704
- No, he never entered.

1506
01:29:33,706 --> 01:29:34,973
- Why not?

1507
01:29:34,975 --> 01:29:36,875
It's amazing.
- Yeah, well, he didn't think

1508
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:38,310
it was good enough
for the competition,

1509
01:29:38,312 --> 01:29:40,447
but he did think it
was good enough for me.

1510
01:29:41,714 --> 01:29:43,182
You know, there's
an interesting story

1511
01:29:43,184 --> 01:29:44,985
behind the painting
of Starry Night.

1512
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:47,886
Vincent Willem van
Gogh painted it

1513
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:52,893
while looking out at an area
called Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

1514
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,862
He was in a mental institution.

1515
01:29:56,263 --> 01:29:59,333
And the view from his window
was looking east from his room.

1516
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:04,036
He loved to paint in the
stillness before dawn

1517
01:30:04,038 --> 01:30:05,606
to calm himself.

1518
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:09,740
He didn't like the painting,
he wanted to destroy it.

1519
01:30:09,742 --> 01:30:11,744
But his brother
talked him out of it.

1520
01:30:13,013 --> 01:30:16,050
One of the most famous
paintings in the world.

1521
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,328
- Justin.

1522
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:30,763
You have to see this.

1523
01:30:32,799 --> 01:30:36,835
Look at it, it's this
video that's going viral.

1524
01:30:36,837 --> 01:30:41,406
This big hotshot from
the Louvre Museum,

1525
01:30:41,408 --> 01:30:44,610
he was showing some
dignitaries around,

1526
01:30:44,612 --> 01:30:45,811
and he reached up,

1527
01:30:45,813 --> 01:30:48,349
and his pants fell
down around his ankles.

1528
01:30:49,782 --> 01:30:52,484
You should appreciate this,
as much as you love art.

1529
01:30:59,693 --> 01:31:00,594
I'll be right back.

1530
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,714
- There she is.

1531
01:31:22,782 --> 01:31:23,617
- Hi.

1532
01:31:29,623 --> 01:31:31,025
- So this is it, huh?

1533
01:31:32,126 --> 01:31:34,559
- Yeah, yeah, I guess
we're about set.

1534
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:36,463
- How's Justin doing
with all of this?

1535
01:31:37,865 --> 01:31:40,599
- You know, I don't know that
he's real happy about it,

1536
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:42,934
but he's resigned.

1537
01:31:42,936 --> 01:31:44,736
You know, he's still
gonna see a psychiatrist.

1538
01:31:44,738 --> 01:31:46,872
Dr. James found me
someone in California.

1539
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:49,007
- Good, that's good.
- Yeah.

1540
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:50,909
- I'm glad I got to see
you before you left.

1541
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:52,511
I got some news.

1542
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,146
I wanted to tell
you face to face.

1543
01:31:54,148 --> 01:31:55,180
- Wait, wait.

1544
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:56,083
What's wrong?

1545
01:31:57,685 --> 01:31:59,418
- Why something always
gotta be wrong, Deena?

1546
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,886
- Because when someone tells you

1547
01:32:00,888 --> 01:32:02,554
they need to tell you
something face to face,

1548
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:03,722
Usually there's something wrong.

1549
01:32:03,724 --> 01:32:04,923
- No, nothing's wrong.

1550
01:32:04,925 --> 01:32:06,158
- So what is it?

1551
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:07,392
- You ever hear
of a film company,

1552
01:32:07,394 --> 01:32:08,696
"Again With A Feeling"?

1553
01:32:09,963 --> 01:32:11,463
- Yeah.

1554
01:32:11,465 --> 01:32:13,167
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with anything?

1555
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:16,337
- They bought one of my scripts.

1556
01:32:17,404 --> 01:32:18,305
- Oh my God.

1557
01:32:19,306 --> 01:32:20,138
For real?

1558
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,373
- Yeah, for real.

1559
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,708
What you said to
me the other night

1560
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:24,710
about being a
great screenwriter,

1561
01:32:24,712 --> 01:32:25,877
it helped me.

1562
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:27,913
I submitted a
script to an agent.

1563
01:32:27,915 --> 01:32:29,049
He hooked me up and...

1564
01:32:31,618 --> 01:32:34,355
- William, you should
come out to LA.

1565
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:36,755
- LA?

1566
01:32:36,757 --> 01:32:38,023
- Yeah, I mean, we're
gonna be right near there.

1567
01:32:38,025 --> 01:32:39,391
You'd have all kinds of
opportunities, you know?

1568
01:32:39,393 --> 01:32:41,426
Just the sky's the limit.

1569
01:32:41,428 --> 01:32:42,327
- I don't know.

1570
01:32:42,329 --> 01:32:43,161
What about...

1571
01:32:43,163 --> 01:32:44,262
- What about what?

1572
01:32:44,264 --> 01:32:45,097
- Well, Sonny.

1573
01:32:45,099 --> 01:32:46,365
- What about him?

1574
01:32:46,367 --> 01:32:47,332
- He's not doing so hot.

1575
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:49,169
His health, it's failing.

1576
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:52,339
I'm all he's ever had, you know?

1577
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,440
He's all I ever had, Deena.

1578
01:32:55,442 --> 01:32:56,775
- I mean, he could
come with you.

1579
01:32:56,777 --> 01:32:59,111
It's just never
too late, you know.

1580
01:32:59,113 --> 01:32:59,913
I mean...

1581
01:33:01,115 --> 01:33:02,349
- Sonny's not gonna move.

1582
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:22,269
You're an amazing person, Deena.

1583
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:31,145
- Well, you know, I'm
still really happy for you.

1584
01:33:32,713 --> 01:33:34,479
I'm gonna tell everyone I know

1585
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,251
that I'm friends with a
big, famous screenwriter.

1586
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:43,755
- Take care, Deena.

1587
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:44,591
All right?

1588
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:04,736
- Well, are you all set?

1589
01:35:04,738 --> 01:35:05,972
- Yeah.

1590
01:35:05,974 --> 01:35:07,172
I took one last look
around the place,

1591
01:35:07,174 --> 01:35:09,140
and I got everything.

1592
01:35:09,142 --> 01:35:10,208
- Okay.

1593
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:12,077
You're not gonna take Van Gogh?
