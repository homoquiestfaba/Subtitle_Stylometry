00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,900
Some murders take seconds...

2
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:13,674
Others take minutes...

3
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:17,603
Some murders take hours...

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,840
Now...

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
this murder...

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,267
takes YEARS!

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,000
It began as a nuisance

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,400
Ouch! What the...

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,700
It became a menace

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,269
Get out of my house!

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,100
What the f*ck is wrong with you!?

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,400
Now...

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,490
Forensic Pathologist Jack Cucchiaio
is running for his life...

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,940
Lunatic has been attacking me all night
He's just broken into my house and...

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,200
I need a squad car here right now!

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,710
Ok, this might sound
ridiculous, but he's got a

17
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,800
spoon but it hurts like hell!
And.. and I...

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,500
H... Hello? Hello?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,600
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
F*ck!

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,591
The strange man has been
attacking me with a spoon...

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,300
He's haunting me like...
oh... everywhere...

23
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,100
and... and it... Baby...

24
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,200
Did you say spoon?

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
Oh I just want my life back!

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,500
You need professional help, Jack...

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,500
Get the hell out of here!

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry Jack, but
there's just no way to

29
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,200
determine that these wounds
aren't self-inflicted.

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
They are not self-inflicted!

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,327
You need the evidence, Jack...

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,237
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I've travelled 10.000 miles,
I'll pay any price!

34
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,500
Just tell me what this means?

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The mark of a Genosage! Nothing
can stop the Genosage...

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,300
the Genosage will never stop...

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,500
until you are...
...DEAD!

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,159
It will follow you to
the ends of the earth!

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,800
What would you do?
You can't escape!

40
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,148
You can't stop it!

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,100
You can't kill it!

42
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:17,315
It will find you!

43
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,613
It will catch you!
It will hit you!

44
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,200
With a spoon!
Again, and again, and again...

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,300
and again, and again, and again...
and again,

46
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,800
and again, and again...
(oh so tired, lol)

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,400
The spoon thunders down with relentless
merciness, soul shattering fury

48
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Pounding and bounding
and bounding, shuffle

49
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,100
soft spots into your
skull until it cracks!

50
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,900
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

51
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,100
Come on! Come on!
Come on mother f*cker!

52
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,500
Jack!

53
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,000

54
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,900

with a running time of over 9 hours!

57
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,860
Perhaps...

58
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,200
the most relentless murder
in the history... of cinema.

59
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,816
Chaotic Rampage American Pictures
(C.R.A.P) Proudly presents...

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:03,340
