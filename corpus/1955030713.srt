1
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,041
Here, Beethoven.

2
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:20,771
Here, boy.

3
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,841
Here's a special treat.

4
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,112
Here, Beethoven.

5
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:33,723
This is from all of us.

6
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,660
Beethoven.

7
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,187
I want you to have this.

8
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,598
Mom, we're out of toilet paper!

9
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,003
Here!

10
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,713
Come on, kids!
You're gonna be late.

11
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,068
The thing is, the bank has got to see
that what we're doing here is important.

12
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:29,273
That air fresheners do more
than just freshen air.

13
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,681
- I'm sure that the bank's aware of it.
- I'm sure they are.

14
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,447
If this bank manager has
any imagination, he'll understand.

15
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,319
Ryce, breakfast! Go ahead.

16
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,553
- Tell me how you're gonna start.
- I'm gonna say, "Mr. Bickert...

17
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:45,188
I woke up one morning a couple
of months ago and I realized something."

18
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:48,631
- Didn't I have sausage?
- You ate it, honey.

19
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:07,612
Honey, don't say "challenge."
It's a scary word to a bank.

20
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,916
- Opportunity.
- Ah, good. Much better.

21
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,514
There's a much bigger
opportunity out there.

22
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,525
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, honey.

23
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,925
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning. Not just...

24
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,987
Not just to connect
people's air fresheners...

25
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:21,555
- Not now, boy. We're late.
- or to their truck.

26
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,999
Listen to this.

27
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:26,697
- Ryce, come on!
- Hi, thanks for picking me up.

28
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,003
No.

29
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,407
What am I gonna wear?

30
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:41,143
Hi. Thanks for picking me up.

31
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,361
What do you think?

32
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:58,528
Mom, life is amazing.

33
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,971
I'm getting a ride to school
with Michelle and Taylor Devereaux.

34
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,407
- Who's Taylor Devereaux?
- A boy.

35
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,341
A boy.

36
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:12,413
Not a challenge,
it's an opportunity.

37
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:16,215
Not just to connect air fresheners
to a person's car or truck...

38
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,848
- but to connect air fresheners...
- Mr. Newton!

39
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,323
to a person's entire life.

40
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,518
You call the pitch.

41
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:24,892
This is an opportunity
to connect air fresheners...

42
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,398
to a person's car or truck.

43
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:31,926
Nooo! Ooo-ooh.
Aaah!

44
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,064
Oh, nooo!

45
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,108
Aaah!

46
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,474
Alice, the news kid threw
the paper, knocked the coffee.

47
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,536
- Aw, that's terrible.
- I was trying to concentrate.

48
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:45,049
Now I gotta change my clothes.

49
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:50,755
- Hi.
- Hi.

50
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,791
Michelle said you could use
a ride to school.

51
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,587
Yeah.

52
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,726
- Hi.
- Hi.

53
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:01,391
- I'm Taylor Devereaux.
- And I'm Ryce's mom.

54
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:06,996
- And that's my dad.
- Hi there.

55
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,306
Don't worry.
I'll get Ryce to school and back safely.

56
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,540
Oh, I'm not worried. You're very
handsome, so she can be a little late.

57
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,280
Thanks, Mom.
Bye, Dad.

58
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,750
Seat belts.

59
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,580
What?

60
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:30,094
That's the best-looking kid
I've ever seen in my life.

61
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,151
Oh, God.

62
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,790
Honey, he's just giving her
a ride to school.

63
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,697
Why does she need a ride?

64
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,601
- It's a two-minute walk.
- Hi, Michelle.

65
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,365
You used to give me
a ride to school, remember?

66
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,633
On a bicycle.

67
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:46,440
Still, honey, you were very, very...
No, you were quite a...

68
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,676
- Mommy, are we late yet?
- Oh, God, I gotta get goin'!

69
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,582
- Good luck, Dad.
- Thanks.

70
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,950
Okay. It's okay.
Take it easy.

71
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,013
Oooh, George, honey,
your socks!

72
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,218
Aaah! I'm late!

73
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:04,558
It's okay. Just don't cross
your legs. That's easy, huh?

74
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,559
Beautiful.

75
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,162
- So, you got strawberry?
- Uh-huh.

76
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,925
Has it got real strawberry in it?

77
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:26,129
I'll have a single cone, please.
What are you gonna have, Missy?

78
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:30,003
Okay, make that two strawberries.

79
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:32,837
Let's see.

80
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:43,750
What, you know this guy?
Huh? Hello? Missy?

81
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:51,023
I think she's got a date.

82
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,368
Uh, better make that
three strawberry.

83
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,720
Okay, this one's on me.
But next time, you're buying.

84
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:26,729
Here you go.

85
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:29,231
There ya go.
How's that? Huh?

86
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:55,191
Kiss the dog good-bye, Brillo.
Visiting hours are over.

87
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:57,351
Regina.

88
00:09:57,427 --> 00:10:00,555
Look, what do you wanna take Missy for?
You hate dogs.

89
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,430
- You hate all living things.
- Look, this is not about animals.

90
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,437
It's about alimony. And since I got the
court order, the dog stays with me...

91
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,598
until we negotiate
our little divorce.

92
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,040
Did my lawyer tell you what I want?

93
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,010
Yeah, $50,000.

94
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,636
That's right.

95
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:19,841
If I had the 50,000,
things would be different, but I don't.

96
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,679
- Well, then get it.
- Which dog, baby?

97
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:24,619
That one.
The one with the bow.

98
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:28,715
- That's a big dog.
- Look, just put her in the back.

99
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,090
- Don't do this, Regina.
- Brillo, shut up and pay up!

100
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,129
Come here.

101
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,061
Come on!

102
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,025
Stupid bow.

103
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,362
You want your dog back?
Call my lawyer.

104
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,238
Let's go, Missy.

105
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,814
Move it, stupid.

106
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:24,668
When we hide that mutt
where he can't see her...

107
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,437
the dumb slob
is gonna fall apart at the seams.

108
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:30,674
That's when he pays the big bucks.

109
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:34,183
I know the type. Emotionally
vulnerable. He's a real marshmallow.

110
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,084
Floyd?

111
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:40,247
- Do me a favor, okay?
- Yes, dear.

112
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:44,623
People in California generally swallow
before they start talking.

113
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:49,757
Hey.
I know how to eat in California, okay?

114
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,801
And then we have in every gym bag...

115
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:03,328
in every locker room, in every health
club in America: sports fresheners.

116
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,271
Here, smell this.

117
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:09,639
That smells terrible.

118
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:12,773
Old underwear, unwashed jockstrap,
cheese sandwich.

119
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,340
- That's disgusting.
- But we have a solution!

120
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,943
- Throw in a Newt.
- Throw in a Newton! Now smell it.

121
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:19,852
I'll take your word for it.

122
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:23,692
It takes a second to settle.

123
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,661
We really think we have
a winner here, Mr. Bickert.

124
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,756
We just need $45,000 to retool
and get some new machinery.

125
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,630
And $20,000 for a TV commercial.

126
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,861
That's the key.

127
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,428
I can't authorize another loan
to your company...

128
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:39,134
but I can restructure
your debt...

129
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,701
and extend a secured demand loan
to the two of you as individuals.

130
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,216
- What does that mean?
- Your product flops, you lose your home.

131
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,020
Aha.

132
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:25,443
- We'll take Alex.
- Jeff.

133
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,539
- James.
- David.

134
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,550
Tim.

135
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:32,552
J.J.

136
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:38,248
- We'll get Darrell.
- We get Brian.

137
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:41,453
We'll take Alex.

138
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,793
We'll takeJeff.

139
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,957
And you can have shorty.

140
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,502
No way. It's your pick.
You take shorty.

141
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,401
Well, we'll take Heather.

142
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:57,638
- Heather, you wanna play?
- Yeah.

143
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,781
- Can I use this?
- Come on. Let's go.

144
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:13,354
You know, I've been thinkin'.

145
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:15,395
- Have you been thinkin'?
- Yes.

146
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,090
What have you been thinkin'?

147
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,428
Well, I'm thinkin',
"What do you think?"

148
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,333
- Well...
- You know what I'm thinkin', hon?

149
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:24,701
If things keep going
the way they are now...

150
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,763
we're gonna end up
sellin' the house anyway.

151
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,809
Well...

152
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:32,368
Selling the house isn't exactly
the same thing as losin' the house.

153
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:36,045
- That's a thought.
- That's what I've been thinkin'.

154
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:38,209
Hon, it's tossed.
It's done.

155
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,821
Well, thanks for the ride.

156
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:49,021
You know, I saw you up
in the mountains last summer.

157
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,791
You have a cottage up there?

158
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:53,857
Uh... no, we just rent one
for a week.

159
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:58,837
The reason I remember is because when
I saw you, I had this thought.

160
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,534
Well, what thought?

161
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:06,239
I thought, "I wonder
if she's ever been kissed?"

162
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,935
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

163
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,983
- Honey, if that's what you think.
- I'll call the bank.

164
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:49,989
- Good.
- You sure?

165
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:52,025
- Well...
- Yeah.

166
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,125
Hi, honey.

167
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:02,792
It's 7:30.

168
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:45,928
I think Beethoven's
got a girlfriend.

169
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:47,564
What makes you think that?

170
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:50,132
He keeps sneaking out
of the house like this.

171
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,199
Come on!

172
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,555
Any sign of her?

173
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:42,618
No. I looked in the alley.
I looked under the bridge.

174
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,687
I even looked in the new
sewer pipes they're puttin' in.

175
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,130
I don't know where she went.

176
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,395
- What did you come back for?
- I need a shower.

177
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:51,961
What you need is a brain transplant.
Now, Floyd, go back and find the dog.

178
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:55,133
Without that dog,
my divorce is worth peanuts!

179
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,540
Relax.
We'll find the dog.

180
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,738
I'll put notices up. Somebody's bound
to see her and bring her back.

181
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:04,614
Somebody's bound to bring her back?
What year are you livin' in?

182
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:06,482
No one is gonna bring back
a missing dog.

183
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:08,578
People don't do things
for each other anymore.

184
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:12,022
Maybe the dog'll come back on
its own! Dogs are very loyal.

185
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:13,081
No, Floyd.

186
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,561
Dogs are stupid.
And do you have to stand that way?

187
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,962
Didn't my trainer teach you
how to stand?

188
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:21,933
How can we have a relationship
if you can't stand.

189
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:24,095
I'm gonna kill that stupid dog.

190
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,171
That's her.
That's the dog.

191
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,437
Dogs don't knock, Floyd.

192
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:32,736
Who are you?

193
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:36,840
Gus, the janitor. I found your dog.
She's down in the storage room.

194
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:40,045
- I think she's been sleeping there.
- She has? Thank God.

195
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,680
Take the luggage, put it in the car,
bring it out front.

196
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,815
We're gettin' outta here.

197
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:13,378
Puppies!

198
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:16,183
Little Beethovens.

199
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,986
Did you and your girlfriend
have babies?

200
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,321
Aren't they the cutest?

201
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:45,312
Okay, Gus, where's the dog?

202
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:51,185
I don't know.
I left her right here.

203
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:54,050
Here, doggie, doggie, doggie.

204
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:59,026
Here, doggie, doggie.

205
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,428
I don't know how someone like you
manages to hold onto a job, Gus. Missy!

206
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:08,735
- Where are you, Missy?
- Must be somewhere near here.

207
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:10,867
- Missy.
- Doggie.

208
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:12,433
Come here, Missy.

209
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:18,106
Better come see this.

210
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,744
What is this?

211
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,418
Aren't you one big pain in the butt.

212
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,651
What do you want me to do
with these puppies?

213
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:29,559
I don't know. Get rid of'em.

214
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:33,120
Animal shelters charge money
to turn dogs in.

215
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,463
So? Drown 'em.
What do I care?

216
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,559
Let's go, Missy!

217
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:40,571
Come on, Missy.
You're nothin' but trouble.

218
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:48,269
The fewer dogs in the world, the better!
I can't believe you got pregnant!

219
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:50,907
Let's go! Come on!

220
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:57,050
We gotta do something.
Here, here, take one.

221
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,148
Come on. Let's go, Missy.

222
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:01,750
Oh, God, this dog.

223
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:04,591
You know, the little puppies
sure look like purebreds.

224
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:05,687
Yeah. So?

225
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,630
Puppies like that
are worth big money.

226
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,397
You could sell 'em
at a pet shop and make a bundle.

227
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,199
Ya think so?

228
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:16,264
- Yeah.
- I never thought of that.

229
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,333
There's a red Mercedes
parked up front.

230
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,708
Tell my boyfriend
to put her in the back.

231
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,771
I'll take care of you later.
Go, Missy, go.

232
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:28,884
- Why don't you watch where you're goin'?
- Um... hello.

233
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:32,788
Would you like to buy some candy bars?
They're to raise money for our school.

234
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:36,589
Oh, really?
How much are they?

235
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,256
Eleven dollars each.

236
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,061
Eleven dollars?
What are you, crazy?

237
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,534
Get your butts outta here
before I call security!

238
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:47,163
- You don't live here!
- Uh, thank you.

239
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:49,669
Thank you.

240
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,754
Little puppies!

241
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:10,625
Come to Regina.
Puppy.

242
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,893
Puppies?
Puppy?

243
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,161
What the...

244
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,267
Those little brats.

245
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:26,311
We could've made a fortune
on those puppies.

246
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,973
Relax, honey.
The big money's in the backseat.

247
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:32,813
No one steals from me, ever!

248
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:38,517
Believe me, Floyd. I'm gonna get those
puppies back if it kills me. Come on.

249
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,156
Hurry up!

250
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:18,723
Dad's on the lawn.

251
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:21,960
He won't want puppies.
He didn't even want Beethoven.

252
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:24,867
Distract him
while I sneak around back.

253
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,565
Ask him a question where he ends up
giving you a lecture.

254
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,164
- Okay.
- Go.

255
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:40,207
Hi, peanut.

256
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:44,217
Daddy, where do babies come from?

257
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,315
Babies?

258
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:48,724
Babies?
Where do they come from?

259
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,555
Well...

260
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:03,570
Every mommy has a teeny-weeny...
uh, little egg inside her body.

261
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:06,167
An egg?
Like an Easter egg?

262
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:10,306
An Easter... No, not-not like an Easter
egg. Smaller than an Easter egg.

263
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:13,317
Like a robin's egg?

264
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:17,879
Uh... real-really,
uh... smaller than, uh...

265
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:20,448
More like a... More like
a goldfish egg, except...

266
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:23,992
Let's see here.

267
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,541
Uh, it-it-it...
it swims up, uh...

268
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,544
- a-a-a river.
- A river?

269
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:43,740
A river that-that
every mommy has inside of her...

270
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:47,115
so, so, uh...
uh, so-so-so...

271
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:49,347
a teeny-weeny
little egg, uh...

272
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:52,288
just swims up the, uh,
the, uh, the river.

273
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:55,122
Now, guys, little squeaks are okay.

274
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,652
Just don't bark until I figure out
what we're gonna do with you.

275
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,211
And there are thousands
and thous... millions!

276
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:20,650
Millions of tadpoles just swimming
around the teeny little egg...

277
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:24,849
- in-in-in the itty-bitty river.
- How do the tadpoles get in the river?

278
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,525
They're in there.
They're just in there.

279
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:34,225
And-And-And the strongest
tadpole of all...

280
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:37,700
the one that...
the most determined tadpole.

281
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,900
The tadpole that-that would win
the gold medal in the Olympics.

282
00:29:41,974 --> 00:29:45,910
You really don't know
much about this, do you, Dad?

283
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:54,516
Ryce, come here.

284
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,850
- What is it?
- Shhh. You gotta come downstairs.

285
00:29:56,922 --> 00:30:00,688
Well, I'm studying. I've got a final
on Friday. Why are we whispering?

286
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:07,257
Puppies! Oh, my gosh.
Where did you get them?

287
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:08,424
They're Beethoven's.

288
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,298
The lady who owned their mother
was gonna drown them.

289
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:17,473
Oh, my God.
They're all so cute!

290
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:19,738
Mom and Dad don't know yet.

291
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,447
We'll wait until Dad's
in a good mood.

292
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:27,178
Yeah, well, it'll have to be
a really good mood.

293
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,332
Hey, Mr. Newton!

294
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:07,253
All right, Jordan.
Right down the pike.

295
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:15,432
Sorry.

296
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:23,137
- Alice!
- Maybe fresh milk will help.

297
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:26,200
- Did you get the vet?
- I'm on hold.

298
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:34,778
Come on, puppy.
Please take a sip.

299
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:39,085
- It's no use.
- Yes, Doctor.

300
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:42,252
Yeah, they're very young,
and their mother's gone...

301
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,522
and they won't drink milk
from a bowl.

302
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:49,226
Milk replacement powder?
With an eye dropper?

303
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,495
Yes.

304
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,300
Six to eight times a day?

305
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,846
Our customers think of themselves
as hypersensitive people.

306
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:06,676
They think of themselves as at the mercy
of these irritating odors.

307
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:08,774
I wanna give them
something to fight back with.

308
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:11,150
When they say, "Throw in a Newton"...

309
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,849
I want people to think of throwing
a grenade, a missile, an atomic bomb...

310
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:15,390
Slow down.

311
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,162
- I think you're workin' too hard.
- Ya think so?

312
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,360
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I know so.

313
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:27,232
I'm glad Fourth of July's comin'.
We'll go someplace.

314
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:30,636
Alice, we can't go someplace.
We don't have any money.

315
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,732
I know.
I'm not talking about a big deal.

316
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,403
- I'm talkin' about a small thing.
- Alice, please.

317
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:39,505
George, just take a minute now.
Do something else. Just relax.

318
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:44,110
- Go spend time with the kids. All right?
- The kids?

319
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:46,781
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Friday
mornings are gonna be trouble.

320
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:49,017
What about the other days?

321
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,686
On Monday and Wednesday,
I have a free period in the morning.

322
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,857
Em and I will do the lunch hour
feeding while Mom's at the office.

323
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,526
Any way you can get home
and back during recess?

324
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,193
Morning recess is too short.

325
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,568
- Afternoons we can.
- If we run.

326
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,629
Kids!

327
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:07,141
Shoot. Here, take this. Go on.

328
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:14,146
Kids?

329
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,715
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Dad.

330
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,589
Did we forget
to do something?

331
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:26,595
No.

332
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:29,223
Would you like us
to do something?

333
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,698
No.

334
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,199
You're playing Monopoly! Can I be
the battleship? Can I be the banker?

335
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:40,536
Um, well...
Emily's banker.

336
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,010
It helps improve
my math skills.

337
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,446
- It does?
- And I'm the property man.

338
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:53,488
We're almost through.

339
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:55,217
- Yeah.
- Okay.

340
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,816
Next time you're gonna play,
call me, okay?

341
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:00,362
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay?

342
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,390
- Bye, kids.
- Bye.

343
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:05,127
Bye.

344
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:13,239
Em, I told you not to
bring them up here.

345
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:18,372
That was close. Okay, now who wants
Tuesdays and Thursdays?

346
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:20,473
"Dear Miss Anderson...

347
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,486
please excuse Ryce from classes
on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday...

348
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:27,489
because she has to go to the doctor's
to get allergy shots.

349
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:29,548
yours truly,
George M. Newton."

350
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:39,490
Ah, forget her.
He likes you. He told me.

351
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:43,636
God, you can see her bra
right through her shirt.

352
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,607
Like totally accidental,
I'm sure.

353
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:48,701
Come on.

354
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:14,363
Come on, you guys.

355
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:16,234
Hungry?

356
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:21,473
Honey?

357
00:35:21,544 --> 00:35:25,275
What do you think of spearmint
for racquetball players?

358
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,319
Or should it be peppermint?

359
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:41,152
What do you think about
spearmint for soccer players?

360
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:44,682
Do you think there's enough soccer
players to justify their own scent?

361
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:03,010
They're eating.

362
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,070
They're eating by themselves.

363
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:25,298
Whoa, it's early for bed
for you two tonight.

364
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:30,905
- Hello?
- Mrs. Newton?

365
00:37:30,973 --> 00:37:33,703
Linda Anderson,
Ryce's chemistry teacher.

366
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:37,177
- Yes.
- I'm calling to see if she's all right.

367
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:39,714
- Why, did something happen?
- No.

368
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:42,342
It's just that with less than
eight weeks of school left...

369
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:45,387
and her missing classes
to get her allergy shots...

370
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:47,581
she might have a problem
catching up.

371
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:49,625
Allergy shots?

372
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:54,052
Come on in.

373
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,658
- Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,429
I just got off the phone
with Miss Anderson.

375
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:05,933
You wanna tell me
what's goin' on, Ryce?

376
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:09,376
I can't.

377
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:12,039
You can't?

378
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:13,411
Oh, honey, yes, you can.

379
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:16,610
We've always been very honest
with each other, haven't we?

380
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:22,348
Are you skipping school
to spend time with boys?

381
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,791
Because if you are,
there was a time...

382
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,593
No, Mom. No. I'm not using drugs
and I'm not pregnant.

383
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,764
What's goin' on?

384
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:44,471
Ted, Emily and I have been hiding
four puppies in the basement.

385
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:53,451
Honey, I'm home!

386
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:55,888
Don't tell your dad.

387
00:38:57,893 --> 00:39:02,728
I show him the hockey player. He flips
for the mahogany vanilla. He loved it.

388
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,859
He wants to smell the rest of the line
right away. The buzz is really starting.

389
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:09,598
There's a buzz.
Did you hear that, kids?

390
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:13,438
Now, now, now, on another front,
this is a big one.

391
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:16,603
Due to a special request
from your mother...

392
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,673
I have found the perfect vacation spot
for a family with a limited cash flow.

393
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:23,912
Wait a minute. We can't
afford anything right now.

394
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,010
No. This we can afford.

395
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:27,214
Our Velcro supplier,
Fred Serbiak...

396
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,088
has been offering us his cottage
in the mountains for years.

397
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,595
Well, it's empty this Fourth of July,
and since you have told me...

398
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:36,632
that there'll be no business
this Fourth of July, I said yes.

399
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,463
So, this Fourth of July...

400
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:44,666
we are going to spend four
fun-filled days at Fred Serbiak's...

401
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,540
- mountain getaway absolutely free!
- Oh, my God.

402
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:51,444
- Honey, this is gonna be great.
- Yeah.

403
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,573
Fred was a little concerned
that we had a dog...

404
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:55,514
but I said our guy
wouldn't be any trouble.

405
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,650
Isn't that right,
you little Chihuahua, you?

406
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,329
Bless you. I mean no business,
no phones, no nothing.

407
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,694
Bless you. I mean no business,
no phones, no nothing.

408
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:10,630
I'm gonna run a load
through the dishwasher.

409
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,101
Isn't it customary to do that
after we have dinner?

410
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,503
- Uh... yeah.
- I don't know about you guys...

411
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:19,871
but I really need a break.

412
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:26,040
Just a few days to get away.

413
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,851
Are those sounds coming
from outside or in the basement?

414
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:37,552
Outside.

415
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:43,321
I think I'm hearing something
from the basement.

416
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,004
Oh, no!

417
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,776
Roll, anyone?

418
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,183
No, no, no, no!

419
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:09,452
Look, this is not one dog. This is
five dogs. I know they're cute now.

420
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:12,119
But pretty soon
they're gonna be monster dogs.

421
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:13,855
They'll destroy our house...

422
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,127
they'll ruin the Serbiak cottage,
and they'll drive me out of my mind.

423
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,228
Hygienically, emotionally, financially,
we cannot afford these dogs.

424
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:25,967
Do you think I'm crazy?

425
00:41:27,176 --> 00:41:30,634
Don't give me those looks.
The answer is no!

426
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:33,739
They would be a lot of trouble,
wouldn't they?

427
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:37,616
Trouble? Four puppies?
Five Saint Bernards?

428
00:41:37,686 --> 00:41:39,813
It's beyond trouble.

429
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:42,790
Well, was I a lot of trouble
when I was a baby?

430
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,490
No.

431
00:41:47,563 --> 00:41:50,691
- What about when there were three of us?
- Yes.

432
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:54,167
Well, would you rather have had less
trouble and stopped after you had me?

433
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:57,899
- You're our children. These are dogs.
- These are our children.

434
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,465
I don't want to be responsible
for five dogs.

435
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:04,035
You don't have
to be responsible.

436
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:07,605
We've been responsible.
We've gone through hell for these dogs.

437
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:10,948
And if being responsible means
that we have to lose them now...

438
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,419
then I hate responsibility.

439
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:18,487
Dad, we kept them alive just
like you and Mom kept us alive.

440
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:24,760
And you're not gonna
take them away from us.

441
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:32,071
Look. If we keep them now, when they're
bigger we can find them new homes.

442
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:35,838
But this should be a situation
the whole family can live with.

443
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:45,816
Look!

444
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:53,753
- Yea!
- Oh, thank you so much, Dad.

445
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:56,855
No! Don't bring them over to me.
This is a mistake!

446
00:42:56,966 --> 00:43:01,096
Now that the puppies are part of
the family, we should give them names.

447
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,798
Well, this one's a girl,
so how about if we call her Morgan?

448
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:08,674
- No, she looks more like a Dolly.
- What does a Dolly look like?

449
00:43:08,744 --> 00:43:11,474
- Like her.
- Okay.

450
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:15,813
Then I get to name this one.
Since his dad's name is Beethoven...

451
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,251
then his name should be...
Tchaikovsky.

452
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,484
I like it, but it
sounds kinda goofy.

453
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:26,660
What should we name him, hmm?

454
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,754
He looks like a Chubby.

455
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:30,822
Definitely a Chubby.

456
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,734
You're cool. You're the coolest one
in the whole family.

457
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:36,828
I'm gonna name you Mo.

458
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:40,342
- Mo, like in Mozart?
- No, Mo like in Mohawk.

459
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,343
Look at his hair.

460
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,938
Mo. Cool. Hey, Mo.

461
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:47,983
What do ya know?

462
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:10,596
Stay in there. No!

463
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,171
No, no!

464
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:56,039
Puppy!

465
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:03,581
Puppy!

466
00:46:20,302 --> 00:46:24,033
Was it a fish filet?
It was burgers, right?

467
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:26,666
I need a large fry and...

468
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,701
Hi. May I have your order, please?

469
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:35,079
And would you like fries
with your cheeseburger? Thank you.

470
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,597
Look, it has a dock!

471
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:01,905
And a motorboat!

472
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:05,413
- Hold on.
- Dad, look at this. Watch.

473
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:08,245
Oh, this is beautiful.

474
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:11,411
Wow. Fred has some place.

475
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:15,287
I hadn't realized there was
that kind of money in Velcro.

476
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:17,951
This was a great idea.

477
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:44,180
Hi.

478
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:49,317
There's some hot chocolate,
if you want some.

479
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:50,483
Oh, thanks.

480
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:56,357
Trouble sleeping?

481
00:47:56,431 --> 00:48:00,458
Yeah. New bed.

482
00:48:00,536 --> 00:48:03,801
- What's that?
- The Serbiak's family album.

483
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:06,534
Oh, yeah?

484
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,906
Here you go.

485
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:12,378
- Hey, that's Mr. Serbiak, right?
- Right.

486
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:14,741
Who's that guy
with the mustache next to him?

487
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:17,872
That's Mrs. Serbiak.

488
00:48:19,885 --> 00:48:22,820
They must have been dating
at this time.

489
00:48:22,888 --> 00:48:27,086
How come you and Mom don't have any
pictures from when you were this age?

490
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:30,890
Well, you know, after high school,
she went off to college and...

491
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:35,730
we really didn't see each other
that much for about four years.

492
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:38,861
So how did you keep it together?

493
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:43,203
- Letters.
- Letters? That's it?

494
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:47,678
I wrote two, three letters a day.
I write a very nice letter.

495
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:50,313
Must have been hard.

496
00:48:53,218 --> 00:48:56,710
I mean, being away
from someone you love.

497
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:00,555
Being away from someone you love is one
of the hardest things in the world.

498
00:49:00,626 --> 00:49:03,891
I mean, there were times that I wondered
if I'd even see her again.

499
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:11,054
You could have the dog
just as soon as I get my check.

500
00:50:11,129 --> 00:50:14,257
Yes. Look, you have my word.

501
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,528
Yes. Okay, bye-bye.

502
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:19,469
Ha! He took out a loan.
He sold some bonds.

503
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:21,529
I knew he couldn't live
without that dog.

504
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:22,596
Good.

505
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:26,075
If I have to put up with much more
of these birds and these trees...

506
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:28,135
and all this nature crap,
I'm gonna puke.

507
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,281
What's the matter with her?

508
00:50:37,356 --> 00:50:39,517
I don't know.
Maybe she's hungry.

509
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:42,856
Hungry? Just... Ow!

510
00:50:42,928 --> 00:50:46,955
I just fed her yesterday, for cryin'
out loud. She gotta eat every day?

511
00:51:11,723 --> 00:51:13,156
Don't start with the "I wants."

512
00:51:13,225 --> 00:51:15,557
We're just getting basic groceries,
no silly stuff.

513
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:18,152
- 'Cause we're not millionaires, right?
- Right.

514
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,494
- Are we thousandaires?
- Well, not exactly.

515
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:22,659
- Maybe by Christmas?
- Maybe.

516
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:27,898
Hope nobody thinks Beethoven's
on sale for 50 cents, huh?

517
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:30,498
- Very funny, Mom.
- Oh, come on now.

518
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:32,703
I don't criticize your jokes, do I?

519
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:43,084
Can you believe they don't sell
Evian water in there?

520
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:45,521
And they look at me
like I'm a weirdo.

521
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:48,617
And you try talkin' to 'em,
it's like nothin's goin' through.

522
00:51:53,532 --> 00:51:56,228
- Come on.
- Yes, dear.

523
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:15,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

524
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,914
- You're new here, right?
- Yeah.

525
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,151
- What's your name?
- Ryce.

526
00:52:20,225 --> 00:52:23,251
- Ryce? Like the food?
- Yeah.

527
00:52:23,328 --> 00:52:27,230
I'm Seth. It's not a food group
or anything, but it works.

528
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:30,962
You know, "Seth, get up. Seth,
fix the boat. Seth, you're grounded."

529
00:52:31,036 --> 00:52:34,472
It's fairly basic.
Are you gonna be around for a while?

530
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,565
Actually, I was looking
for the Devereauxs.

531
00:52:37,643 --> 00:52:40,203
You know.
Um, Taylor Devereaux?

532
00:52:40,278 --> 00:52:43,611
- Do you know where he lives?
- Yeah. Um.

533
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:46,947
My dad and I sell 'em firewood.
He lives over on the west shore.

534
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:49,385
Could you take me there?

535
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,821
Sure. Hop on.

536
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:04,131
The big one's Chubby.
The one with the bows is Dolly.

537
00:53:04,202 --> 00:53:09,367
The brown one's Tchaikovsky, and
the small one's Mo. And, uh, I'm Ted.

538
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:11,602
Hi, Tchaikovsky.

539
00:53:11,677 --> 00:53:15,044
So, uh, can I
buy you a Coke?

540
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:23,517
- Aren't I a little tall for you?
- Well, uh, not for me.

541
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:26,614
- Aren't you a little short?
- Well, height's just temporary.

542
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:29,456
When you wake up in the morning,
you're a little taller.

543
00:53:29,528 --> 00:53:32,088
- Right?
- No.

544
00:53:33,098 --> 00:53:34,395
See ya.

545
00:53:43,675 --> 00:53:46,439
- Down there.
- Thanks.

546
00:54:23,782 --> 00:54:26,444
- Did ya find him?
- Yeah.

547
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:55,810
All right,
watch this one.

548
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,561
Hello there.

549
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:18,228
Uh, Dad, this is Seth.
Um, he gave me a ride in from town.

550
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:22,402
- How long you had that bike?
- A couple years.

551
00:55:22,474 --> 00:55:23,771
Splitting wood?

552
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:27,073
Yeah. Gotta be
careful with those.

553
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:28,840
Yeah.

554
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:35,551
Nice meeting you.

555
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,393
You like that guy?

556
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:53,630
I don't know.
What do you think?

557
00:55:57,442 --> 00:55:59,603
Yeah, fine.

558
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:11,251
- You like his earring, though, right?
- Oh, I love his earring.

559
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:14,120
I'm gonna get a pair
for each ear.

560
00:56:16,461 --> 00:56:20,397
Okay. If he asks me to marry him,
I'll tell him I need a little more time.

561
00:56:20,465 --> 00:56:21,454
Marry him.

562
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,772
- Mom, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

563
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,741
Did you ever like two guys
at one time?

564
00:56:41,853 --> 00:56:42,877
Yeah, I did.

565
00:56:42,954 --> 00:56:46,185
How did you end up choosing Dad?

566
00:56:46,257 --> 00:56:48,452
Well, Daddy was a...

567
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:54,965
Oh, my God.

568
00:56:55,032 --> 00:56:58,490
He made me laugh. That's for sure.
Okay, honey. All right.

569
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:06,709
Oh, dear. Okay.
All right, honey. Okay.

570
00:57:06,778 --> 00:57:10,009
All right. You know
you're gonna fall. I'm gonna fall.

571
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:12,174
Honey, please.

572
00:58:28,426 --> 00:58:31,156
- Is that you?
- Hi.

573
00:58:31,229 --> 00:58:33,823
What are you doin' here?

574
00:58:33,898 --> 00:58:38,130
- We were just taking a walk.
- Well, come on up. I'll show ya around.

575
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:41,171
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of late.

576
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:44,402
Come on! Come on!

577
00:58:51,249 --> 00:58:53,945
You might wanna tie
that fur ball up.

578
00:59:13,938 --> 00:59:17,203
- Would you like a beer?
- No, just water, please.

579
00:59:17,275 --> 00:59:20,142
- Hey, relax. Have a beer.
- No, I don't drink.

580
00:59:20,211 --> 00:59:21,405
How do you know that?

581
00:59:21,479 --> 00:59:24,312
I mean, maybe you do drink,
but you just don't know it yet.

582
00:59:24,382 --> 00:59:27,476
Look, she doesn't wanna drink,
she doesn't wanna drink.

583
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:30,316
Hey, gentlemen,
what time is it?

584
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:33,357
It's brewski time!

585
00:59:38,462 --> 00:59:41,397
You know, I probably should be
getting home pretty soon.

586
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,636
He'll be fine.
I promise.

587
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:49,832
Just come upstairs and see the view.
Just for a second.

588
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:54,108
Come on.
Come on.

589
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:56,874
Okay. Just for a second, though.

590
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:03,176
You know what's so strange
is that I just had a dream about you.

591
01:00:03,254 --> 01:00:06,018
Has that ever happened? You dream about
somebody and then you run into them?

592
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,027
Hey, a dog.
You want a beer, big guy?

593
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:13,188
He said yes.

594
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,724
Oh, no!

595
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:23,771
- That's cool!
- That's cool!

596
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,240
Oh, yeah!

597
01:00:29,981 --> 01:00:32,006
Oh, my gosh.

598
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,585
It's beautiful, isn't it?

599
01:00:53,137 --> 01:00:56,766
Hey, remember that time
we kissed in my car?

600
01:01:00,344 --> 01:01:02,778
I still think about that.

601
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:19,255
Oh, this is gonna be great.

602
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,664
Um, we should probably
go back down to the party.

603
01:01:34,879 --> 01:01:37,109
Did you lock the door?

604
01:01:39,884 --> 01:01:43,615
Hey, puppy!

605
01:01:49,894 --> 01:01:52,829
Taylor, this isn't funny.
Just unlock the door.

606
01:01:52,897 --> 01:01:56,993
Ryce, relax. This is gonna be
an experience you're never gonna forget.

607
01:02:05,576 --> 01:02:07,635
Whoa!

608
01:02:10,715 --> 01:02:15,345
Aaaah!

609
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:29,498
Hey, Taylor, great party!

610
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,970
Thanks, Beethoven!

611
01:02:45,649 --> 01:02:50,746
Dear God, we have these puppies,
and we really, really, really love them.

612
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:55,520
And Daddy says when they get bigger,
we have to give them away.

613
01:02:55,593 --> 01:02:58,653
And I know you're
really busy and everything...

614
01:02:58,729 --> 01:03:01,755
but I was wondering
if you might be able to make it...

615
01:03:01,832 --> 01:03:04,630
so they could just
stay puppies forever.

616
01:03:06,604 --> 01:03:08,595
Then we could keep them.

617
01:03:10,608 --> 01:03:11,905
Thank you.

618
01:03:45,476 --> 01:03:49,139
It was like my favorite day of the year.
They had this roller coaster.

619
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:51,579
The Pippin;
I loved it.

620
01:03:51,649 --> 01:03:54,516
TheJackrabbit,
that was another one.

621
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,077
These French fries are fantastic.
I'm gonna get some more.

622
01:03:58,155 --> 01:04:00,783
- Aren't you full after that breakfast?
- It's a vacation.

623
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:03,019
You're supposed to pig out. Fudge!

624
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:04,728
George, slow down.

625
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:07,787
- Can I go on some of the rides?
- Sure. Ted, will you take her?

626
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:11,426
- Oh, sure, but I need some money.
- Now stay together.

627
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,215
- Should we leave the dog?
- We won't be that long. She'll be fine.

628
01:04:45,168 --> 01:04:48,001
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

629
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:54,936
- Hey, give me those.
- What are you gonna do, string bean?

630
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:58,105
- They're mine.
- Ah, used to be. Not anymore.

631
01:04:58,181 --> 01:05:00,741
- Give them back.
- If you want 'em, come and get 'em.

632
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:03,786
- Give 'em back. They're mine!
- Hey!

633
01:05:03,853 --> 01:05:06,048
Hey, what, shorty?

634
01:05:06,122 --> 01:05:09,888
- You wanna see what my dog can do?
- What?

635
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:12,086
My dog. I wanna show you
what he can do.

636
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:16,358
Beethoven, sit.

637
01:05:19,068 --> 01:05:23,630
Oh, I'm impressed... not!
Now bug off!

638
01:05:23,706 --> 01:05:24,832
One more.

639
01:05:27,744 --> 01:05:29,268
Beethoven, bark.

640
01:05:32,248 --> 01:05:35,376
You wanna get your face crushed, shrimp?
Get lost!

641
01:05:36,586 --> 01:05:39,077
Last one.
I promise.

642
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:41,451
Beethoven...

643
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:44,283
bite this guy in the wiener.

644
01:05:51,901 --> 01:05:53,869
I think these are yours.

645
01:05:55,004 --> 01:05:56,471
Thanks, Ed.

646
01:05:56,539 --> 01:05:58,404
Ted.

647
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:02,367
That was really cool, Ted.

648
01:06:02,445 --> 01:06:04,913
Still wanna get that Coke?

649
01:06:04,981 --> 01:06:07,381
Sure. But I'm buyin'.

650
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,418
Come on, kid.

651
01:06:09,485 --> 01:06:13,717
Four balls for a buck.
Thank you, sir.

652
01:06:14,657 --> 01:06:17,683
- Hey.
- Hey, Ryce. How's it goin'?

653
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,785
- Pretty good.
- You here with your parents?

654
01:06:19,862 --> 01:06:22,524
Yeah. You know,
family togetherness time.

655
01:06:22,598 --> 01:06:25,863
My dad's like,
"Hey, you wanna play some Scrabble?"

656
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:29,098
With my dad it's,
"You wanna get up and go hunting?"

657
01:06:29,172 --> 01:06:31,800
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

658
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:34,001
Well, I'll see ya later.

659
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:38,036
Um, hey, do you wanna go
on a picnic or something?

660
01:06:38,114 --> 01:06:40,639
- Sure.
- Great.

661
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:43,584
- I have to ask my dad, though.
- Oh.

662
01:06:43,653 --> 01:06:48,283
Well, your dad will say no. He thinks
I'm a dumb, unsophisticated hick.

663
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:50,292
- No, he doesn't.
- No, it's okay.

664
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,760
He just doesn't know me yet.

665
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:57,391
Once he gets to know me, he'll think
I'm a smart, unsophisticated hick.

666
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:59,935
- I like your bear.
- Oh, you like my bear?

667
01:07:00,002 --> 01:07:02,163
- Yeah.
- I won it just for you.

668
01:07:02,238 --> 01:07:05,503
- Miss, could I have two popcorns?
- Here you go.

669
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:09,773
- I'll have another order of these.
- Hey, Dad! Dad, great news!

670
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:12,781
- Great nachos!
- We entered you in this cool contest.

671
01:07:12,849 --> 01:07:16,615
Oh, no. I couldn't possibly
do anything physical right now.

672
01:07:16,686 --> 01:07:19,849
You don't have to do anything.
You just sit there.

673
01:07:19,922 --> 01:07:21,389
Beethoven's gonna help you.

674
01:07:21,457 --> 01:07:24,187
What kind of contest is it
where you just sit there?

675
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:28,629
And now, teaming man
and man's best friend...

676
01:07:28,698 --> 01:07:32,065
our seventh annual Burger Binge.

677
01:07:36,038 --> 01:07:41,305
Team number one:
Arthur Lewis and Wolfgang!

678
01:07:41,377 --> 01:07:45,575
And in second position,
champions for three years running:

679
01:07:45,648 --> 01:07:49,277
Cliff Klamath and Jaws.

680
01:07:52,388 --> 01:07:54,322
Ya hungry, Cliff?

681
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,585
I'm starving, Steve.

682
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:59,753
And in third position,
let's give a nice warm welcome...

683
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:02,161
to a couple of out-of-towners:

684
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:04,722
George Newton and Beethoven.

685
01:08:07,103 --> 01:08:09,799
We got just one simple rule.

686
01:08:09,872 --> 01:08:13,308
The team that eats the most burgers
in three minutes wins.

687
01:08:13,376 --> 01:08:15,367
Contestants!

688
01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:17,640
Are you ready?

689
01:08:17,713 --> 01:08:19,738
Are you set?

690
01:08:19,816 --> 01:08:22,046
Go!

691
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,766
Dad, come on!
Go, Dad!

692
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:42,430
Come on, Dad! Come on!

693
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:46,407
Hey, wimp!
Where's your appetite?

694
01:08:46,476 --> 01:08:49,343
He's not a wimp!
He's my dad!

695
01:08:49,412 --> 01:08:52,540
Hey, look at that slobber
on that Saint Bernard's mouth!

696
01:08:52,615 --> 01:08:54,583
- Yeah, drool face!
- Drool face!

697
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:57,210
- Drool face! Drool face! Drool face!
- Wimp! Wimp!

698
01:08:58,654 --> 01:09:00,713
Let's go, big fella!

699
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:06,395
All right!
There we go!

700
01:09:10,967 --> 01:09:13,959
Go! Go! Hey, look!

701
01:09:47,336 --> 01:09:49,702
We're in the homestretch.

702
01:09:49,772 --> 01:09:52,832
Got seconds to go!

703
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:55,605
Ten, nine...

704
01:09:55,678 --> 01:09:57,737
eight, seven...

705
01:09:57,813 --> 01:10:01,408
six, five, four...

706
01:10:01,484 --> 01:10:03,679
three, two...

707
01:10:05,488 --> 01:10:07,581
Good boy, Beethoven.

708
01:10:07,657 --> 01:10:10,182
Now we determine the winner.

709
01:10:17,366 --> 01:10:20,233
And with only
three burgers left...

710
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:23,170
the winners are
George Newton and Beethoven!

711
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:26,072
Yeah! All right!

712
01:10:26,142 --> 01:10:28,804
- Way to go! All right, Dad!
- You did great, honey.

713
01:10:28,878 --> 01:10:30,869
Congratulations, Beethoven.

714
01:10:30,947 --> 01:10:33,211
You, too, Beethoven.

715
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:39,114
Isn't this entertaining,
hicks and their dogs.

716
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:57,906
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fi...

717
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:56,726
Whoa!

718
01:12:14,482 --> 01:12:17,144
- Floyd, go check on Missy.
- She's fine.

719
01:12:17,218 --> 01:12:20,346
Look, I got a feeling.
Just go check on her.

720
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:22,412
All right.

721
01:12:35,202 --> 01:12:37,136
Oh, no!

722
01:12:37,204 --> 01:12:40,332
Oh, no!

723
01:12:40,408 --> 01:12:42,467
Oh, no.

724
01:12:42,543 --> 01:12:45,671
Oh, you gotta be
kiddin' me. Oh, boy.

725
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:01,284
Eleven dollars
for chocolate bars, huh?

726
01:13:01,362 --> 01:13:04,160
- It's her.
- But they're our puppies.

727
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:06,165
- They're not yours.
- Give 'em back!

728
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:09,498
Hey, these puppies belong to the mother,
and the mother belongs to me.

729
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:12,835
So get lost.
- You can't have 'em.

730
01:13:12,907 --> 01:13:16,308
Kiss the puppies good-bye, sweethearts.
You're never gonna see them again.

731
01:13:16,377 --> 01:13:19,141
Missy took off with that other big mutt.
They headed up the mountain.

732
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:22,273
- What?
- Their stupid dog!

733
01:13:24,185 --> 01:13:28,588
If I find your stupid dog,
you're never gonna see him again.

734
01:13:29,957 --> 01:13:32,949
- Gimme them mutts.
- Take 'em.

735
01:13:34,862 --> 01:13:38,389
We have to tell Mom and Dad.

736
01:13:38,466 --> 01:13:41,663
Go find Mommy and Daddy.
Go find Mommy and Daddy. Yes.

737
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:46,234
Go find Mommy and Daddy. Go on.

738
01:13:47,274 --> 01:13:50,038
It's workin'!
Come on!

739
01:13:54,915 --> 01:13:57,884
They just took 'em? What kind
of a person takes puppies from kids?

740
01:13:57,952 --> 01:14:01,786
- She's a bad person, Dad.
- She was gonna drown them.

741
01:14:01,856 --> 01:14:04,791
- We'll get those puppies back.
- Come on. Let's go.

742
01:14:38,926 --> 01:14:40,553
Puppies!

743
01:14:40,628 --> 01:14:42,596
Beethoven!

744
01:14:47,635 --> 01:14:50,627
That's right, puppies.
Go find your mommy.

745
01:14:50,704 --> 01:14:53,798
Ugh! I hope those stupid puppies
find their mother.

746
01:14:53,874 --> 01:14:55,865
I'm gettin' tired
of followin'...

747
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:18,498
Oh, I'm a mess.

748
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:31,100
He's leakin' on me!

749
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,339
He's peeing on me!
Oh, God!

750
01:15:33,414 --> 01:15:35,780
Oh, God!

751
01:15:42,356 --> 01:15:44,153
Look!

752
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:45,556
Puppy poops!

753
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:49,118
If it's warm, that means
we're close. Touch it.

754
01:15:49,196 --> 01:15:51,858
- No, you touch it.
- I'm not gonna touch it.

755
01:15:51,932 --> 01:15:53,331
I'll touch it.

756
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,169
It's warm.

757
01:16:03,244 --> 01:16:05,303
Okay, good. They're close.

758
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:07,974
Better wash your hands.

759
01:16:29,937 --> 01:16:33,236
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, my God! Floyd!

760
01:16:51,825 --> 01:16:52,883
Floyd!

761
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,361
Floyd, where are you?

762
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,422
Those puppies,
They're gonna pay for this.

763
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,177
- Floyd!
- Regina!

764
01:17:11,245 --> 01:17:15,375
- What's on your head?
- It's a stump. I can't get it off.

765
01:17:15,449 --> 01:17:17,542
Bend over.

766
01:17:28,062 --> 01:17:30,394
Thanks, Regina!

767
01:18:29,556 --> 01:18:30,716
There they are.

768
01:18:34,061 --> 01:18:37,258
- I'll get Missy.
- And I'll take care of the rest of'em.

769
01:18:37,331 --> 01:18:38,559
Come on.

770
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,712
Get him away from me!

771
01:18:58,218 --> 01:19:00,812
- Get back!
- Hook him! Come on!

772
01:19:00,888 --> 01:19:02,617
Hook him!

773
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:05,590
Aha! Thought you'd get
away from me, didn't ya?

774
01:19:06,927 --> 01:19:10,055
- Here, Floyd.
- Hey, you want some of this?

775
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:13,964
You're not gonna come to Regina?
Come on, Missy. Regina loves you.

776
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:16,025
You can't have him!

777
01:19:16,103 --> 01:19:18,867
You fat, useless lump
of lard! Come on!

778
01:19:20,374 --> 01:19:22,968
Hey, you want some of this?
Back off!

779
01:19:23,043 --> 01:19:25,170
Put the puppy down.

780
01:19:26,713 --> 01:19:30,615
- Well, look who we have here.
- Back off. You're outta your league.

781
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:32,276
Put the puppy down!

782
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:35,412
- You mean this puppy?
- No, no!

783
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:38,253
- Put the puppy down.
- You want this puppy?

784
01:19:38,325 --> 01:19:41,556
- Huh? You can't have him.
- What kind of a person are you?

785
01:19:41,628 --> 01:19:43,960
You don't like me?
What kind of a person are you?

786
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:45,020
Put the puppy down.

787
01:19:45,098 --> 01:19:47,293
Can we talk about this?
Can we calm down?

788
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:50,996
This doesn't have to get ugly.
Put the puppy down.

789
01:19:51,071 --> 01:19:52,163
You ain't seen ugly.

790
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,537
That ain't ugly.
That's ugly!

791
01:20:20,664 --> 01:20:22,359
Hold on!

792
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:24,663
Shut up, and don't do us any favors!

793
01:20:25,803 --> 01:20:28,203
Take your stinkin' puppies
and stuff it!

794
01:20:28,272 --> 01:20:31,298
- Yeah, stuff it!
- Shut up!

795
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:33,843
We're gonna help you!
It will be all right!

796
01:20:33,911 --> 01:20:34,900
You idiot!

797
01:20:34,978 --> 01:20:38,243
- This whole dog business was your idea!
- My idea?

798
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:51,420
You stupid! You got me into this!

799
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:55,658
I didn't even care
about them dogs!

800
01:20:55,733 --> 01:20:58,896
Well.

801
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:00,698
You hungry?

802
01:21:05,509 --> 01:21:10,003
Honey, I'm home! Things are goin'
so great. We have...

803
01:21:52,923 --> 01:21:54,948
Dad, wake up. Wake up.

804
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:01,554
What's wrong, Dad?

805
01:22:05,169 --> 01:22:06,500
I'll get it!

806
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:13,342
- Hi.
- Hi.

807
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,640
- Come on in.
- Oh, thanks.

808
01:22:15,712 --> 01:22:19,307
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, I just have to get my jacket.

809
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:22,614
- I'll be right back.
- Okay. Great.

810
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:28,424
- You taking Ryce to a concert?
- Uh, yes, sir.

811
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:31,359
- Are you driving your motorcycle?
- I brought my dad's Jeep.

812
01:22:31,428 --> 01:22:34,226
- Jeep!
- Oh, a Jeep. That will be fun.

813
01:22:34,298 --> 01:22:37,267
- Don't ya think? How ya doin', Seth?
- Oh, good. How are you?

814
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:39,825
- Fine. Have a nice time tonight.
- Thank you.

815
01:22:39,903 --> 01:22:42,872
- You have a nice time.
- You look sweet, Ryce. Excuse me.

816
01:22:44,374 --> 01:22:45,705
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Brillo.

817
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:47,141
Look who's here.

818
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:49,202
- Hi, Missy.
- Hey, Missy.

819
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:53,644
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I've got some good news.

820
01:22:53,717 --> 01:22:56,345
I just came from court.
The judge threw out Regina's claim.

821
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,356
- That's terrific.
- I keep Missy, and Regina gets nothing.

822
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:03,689
- She deserves it.
- That's wonderful.

823
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,556
Congratulations.

824
01:23:04,628 --> 01:23:07,153
And she'd really like to see
her kids. Are they around?

825
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:10,860
Yeah. Puppies!
Puppies, your mother's here!

826
01:23:10,934 --> 01:23:14,267
Puppies!
Oh, puppies!
