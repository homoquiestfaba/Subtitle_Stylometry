1
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,487
- Here you go, kid.
- Thanks.

2
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,234
You know, I hear a lot of stories

3
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:24,027
come out of that backseat,

4
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,096
but yours is a doozy.

5
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:29,510
I haven't told anybody. I
can't believe I told you.

6
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:31,835
Don't worry, honey. You're
doing the right thing.

7
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,005
And mail that letter...

8
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,240
'cause life is short.

9
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,776
[Chuckles] I know.

10
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,645
But, um, I'm so late.

11
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,230
Could you... ?

12
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:44,598
Yeah.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,084
No problem. All part of the service.

14
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,003
Taxi. Hey!

15
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,139
Uh, we're going to the Oxford.

16
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,375
Well, get in.

17
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:59,313
[*]

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,644
[Woman]: Okay, you're
not going to believe this.

19
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:06,752
He missed the train.

20
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,199
I know.

21
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,934
No, he'll be okay.

22
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,953
He's going to catch the 2:00,
so I'm just letting you know.

23
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,939
I'm fine.

24
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,295
But you'll have to keep
everybody there until we get back.

25
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,741
Sorry.

26
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,748
Could I mail this letter?

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,021
Yeah, whatever.

28
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:25,088
I don't know.

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,702
You can feed them whenever.

30
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:29,073
Perfect. And there's
some salsa in the fridge.

31
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:31,962
Do you know...

32
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:36,300
[*]

33
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:37,501
Yeah. Okay.

34
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:39,936
That's great...

35
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:50,280
<i>[Oliver]: Sometimes, I wonder
who mailed the first letter.</i>

36
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:53,851
<i>Who was that brave soul who
put a stamp on an envelope,</i>

37
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,819
and released it into the world,

38
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,187
<i>trusting a stranger</i>

39
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,008
<i>to deliver it across the
miles and across time.</i>

40
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:04,336
<i>In this new world of instant replies</i>

41
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:05,377
<i>and casual deleting,</i>

42
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,795
what I love about my work is,

43
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:10,093
<i>I can hold a letter, a
real letter, in my hand,</i>

44
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,738
<i>and be that stranger whose sole mission...</i>

45
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:13,676
Next!

46
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:15,635
Yes. Uh...

47
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,352
I'd like a cup of coffee.

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,188
"Aspen," "vail," or "steamboat"?

49
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:20,872
I'm sorry, I'm not following?

50
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:23,136
Small, medium, or large?

51
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,875
Oh, large. Large coffee.

52
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:27,176
Right. Uh... which coffee?

53
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:29,640
Uh, what do you recommend?

54
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,813
Everything's on the board.

55
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,366
This is my first visit.

56
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,341
Frankly, I wouldn't be here at all

57
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,395
if my coffee machine hadn't
been illegally appropriated

58
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:40,868
after an unfortunate war
of words with my superior.

59
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,403
Well, I wouldn't call
her my superior exac...

60
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,404
Excuse me?

61
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,606
Could I just give him my
order while you're reminiscing?

62
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,774
I'll even pay for your coffee,

63
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,175
if you just let me go ahead of you.

64
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:50,563
Be my guest.

65
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:53,740
Sorry. It's just I'm late,
it's my first day at my new job.

66
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,087
Well, at least you're employed.

67
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,970
Aspen "skinny" vanilla latte.

68
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:58,405
Instead of just sitting over there

69
00:02:58,407 --> 00:02:59,561
staring off into cyberspace.

70
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,174
He'll have a steamboat americano.

71
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,743
What is that?

72
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,845
Large black coffee.

73
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,631
Ah!

74
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,083
Most of those people actually are employed.

75
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,985
They're just working from home.

76
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,853
Theoretically.

77
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:16,623
And someone pays them? Theoretically?

78
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,192
Aspen skinny vanilla latte...

79
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:21,594
And a steamboat americano.

80
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:24,731
Gotta go. Keep the change.

81
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,568
Thanks.

82
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:32,605
<i>There it is...</i>

83
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,307
A beacon of hope to those
who still put their faith

84
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:36,292
<i>in the power of a piece of paper</i>

85
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:38,161
<i>and a 46-cent stamp.</i>

86
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:39,546
<i>And behind every letter</i>

87
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,969
<i>stand thousands of dedicated heroes,</i>

88
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,053
<i>who still fight the good
fight through rain and snow</i>

89
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:45,986
<i>and fiscal cliffs</i>

90
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:49,246
<i>to deliver every note,
every card, every letter.</i>

91
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:50,273
Morning, Norman.

92
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:51,641
Morning, Oliver.

93
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:53,417
[Oliver]:  And I am one of them...

94
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,402
<i>The few... The proud...</i>

95
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:56,971
<i>The postal.</i>

96
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,983
<i>I work for you, whoever you are,</i>

97
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:03,001
<i>or whoever you were.</i>

98
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,185
I told you, this is a mistake.

99
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,744
I'm supposed to be assigned
to direct line operations

100
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,452
as a technical systems consultant.

101
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,861
It says right here that you are D.L.O.

102
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,647
Yeah. "Direct line operations."

103
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,285
That's what Washington is now calling

104
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,120
computer-managed delivery services.

105
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,022
Well, we're still calling
it the "dead letter office."

106
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,390
Look, if you just call the PG's office...

107
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,908
- ... in Washington and...
- That's a good idea.

108
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,626
I'll call the postmaster general

109
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:28,596
right after I return that call
from the Secretary of Defense.

110
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,085
Okay. This is ridiculous.

111
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:32,549
I don't belong here.

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,021
You wait right here.

113
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:39,933
Oliver!

114
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:42,080
I want you to train this girl.

115
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,837
She's a computer-something
from Washington.

116
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,672
- No.
- I will fire you.

117
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,073
I have a government service pay level

118
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,341
higher than you can count.

119
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:50,482
I will take away your refrigerator.

120
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:52,493
You will return my Mr. Coffee.

121
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,514
[Clears her throat]

122
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,838
- Done.
- Send her in.

123
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,125
Mclnerney!

124
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,817
It's you.

125
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,652
Mr. Steamboat. Incredible.

126
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,939
You know each other?

127
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:19,575
[Both at same time]: Theoretically.

128
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,138
[*]

129
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:39,049
Rita, Norman... our
ranks have been increased.

130
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:40,250
This is...

131
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,353
This is... ?

132
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,021
Is?

133
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,656
I'm Shane Mclnerney.

134
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,225
[Oliver scoffs]

135
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,561
I can't work with someone named Shane.

136
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,388
Norman?

137
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,789
Tell her why.

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,758
I got it. Because, uh, at some point,

139
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,193
you, Shane, will walk away,

140
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:00,863
and Oliver will need you to... return?

141
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:02,364
Very good, go on.

142
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,867
And Oliver will be forced to say...

143
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,570
[Theatrically]: "Shane! Come back, Shane!"

144
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:09,271
At which point, you will look at me

145
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:12,741
with much the same vacancy
with which you stare at me now,

146
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,643
utterly unaware

147
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,162
of the unfortunate cinematic reference.

148
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,254
Therefore, I shall call you...

149
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,555
Tsk...

150
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:23,524
[Takes a breath]

151
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:25,249
"Sheryl."

152
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,862
Sheryl?

153
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:30,373
Well... [chuckles] I'm
just here temporarily...

154
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,316
And how wise of you

155
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,646
to realize such a great
truth so early on in life.

156
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,055
What I mean is, there's been a mistake.

157
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:38,008
A merry mix-up, perhaps.

158
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:40,204
A mistake? Well, we shall see.

159
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,111
Rita, please file this in a safe place.

160
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,429
A photographic memory is
a plus in this business.

161
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:54,822
I believe there are no
coincidences, Ms. Mclnerney.

162
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,526
Coincidence is the middle
name of the almighty.

163
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,490
You did that?

164
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,043
No. But it is a standard
to which we aspire,

165
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,561
and, one day, we, too, shall join

166
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,704
the pantheon of postal excellence. Hmm?

167
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,710
Every letter

168
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,778
that passes through the
United States postal system

169
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,148
represents an act of faith.

170
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,008
Faith that it will reach its destination

171
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,896
on time and in good condition.

172
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:25,253
Faith that what was written by the writer

173
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:29,147
shall remain private until read by the... ?

174
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,293
Write-ee?

175
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,583
This is a sacred covenant

176
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,835
that, if broken, signals what?

177
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:36,846
Norman?

178
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:39,046
"The breakdown of civilization
and the beginning of anarchy."

179
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,415
This is why we attempt to
ascertain the correct address

180
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,798
using clues on the outside of the envelope

181
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,853
until we have no other choice.

182
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,988
And it is that moment when we decide

183
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:49,447
to open the letter.

184

00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,920
For outing me here and
not back at the office,

545
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,402
in front of Andrea.

546
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,220
I prefer to do as little as possible

547
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:29,889

549
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,944
Welcome, Rita.

550
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,763
I assume you remember where we left off?

551
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:38,981
[Rita sighs wistfully]

552

"I'll always cherish the memory of... "

553
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,101
- "That day... "
- Oh, here it is.

554
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:43,369
"... when we met

555
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,688
and tried so hard not to fall in love."

556
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:49,709
There's an art to the perfect

557
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:50,693
bagel and lox combo.

558
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,811
Okay.

559
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:54,085
You got your onions,
tomatoes, cream cheese,

560
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,330
all your major food groups.

561
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,732
You eat one of these,
you're good for the day?

562
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:57,817
Oh, yeah.

563
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,385
And these are... ?

564
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,894
Ah. Capers. The key to
the whole enterprise.

565
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:03,166
Ah! Uh-oh.

566
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,929
The secret is,

567
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,197
you sort of...

568
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:10,497
Glue the caper into the cheese,

569
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:12,870
that way, they don't roll off.

570
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:14,738
And then the salmon,

571
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,674
then the tomato...

572
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,707
And the onion.

573
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:20,159

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,908
[Charlie chuckles]

579
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,510
Great nose, by the way.

580
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,879
People probably tell you that a lot, right?

581
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,264
Your boyfriend, probably.

582
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,515
You know, forget that.

583
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,784
That's... that's too much
information for a first date.

584
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:51,884
This is a... date, right?

585
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,883
Sort of?

586
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,372
I have a proposition.

587
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,423
Yes.

588
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,358
Whatever it is...

589
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,826
Yes.

590
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,965
So, no last names?

591
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,399
Right.

592
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,653
No emails, no phone numbers, no texting?

593
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:14,937
No tweets.

594
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:16,138
We just spend one day together,

595
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,607
say whatever we want to say

596
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:18,991
with no fear, no judgment,

597
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:21,339
because we won't see each other again.

598
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:22,534
Yeah, see,

599
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,352
that's the part I'm having trouble with.

600
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:25,336
Well, think about it.

601
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,404
I mean, one day

602
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:27,772
when you don't have to worry about

603
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:29,274
what you do or say will affect tomorrow.

604
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,842
We're just living...

605
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:31,843
Right now,

606
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:32,994
today.

607
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:35,747
Is this part of your
"life is short" philosophy?

608
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:38,978
Are you in or out?

609
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:43,721
No texting, no tweeting...
A girl after my own heart.

610
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:46,991
What about Charlie? Is he in or is he out?

611
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:48,960
Well, from the length of this letter,

612
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:51,396
I assume he bought into
the unorthodox plan,

613
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,613
but if the last pages yield as few clues

614
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,593
as the first pages,

615
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:57,361
we're gonna be hard-pressed
to find the writer.

616
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,465
Or the writee.

617
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:01,862
- I've got an idea.
- Oh, happy day.

618
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,696
In the letter, it says that they
went to a park together, right?

619
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,297
"Kelly, from Washington Park." Yeah.

620
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,549
I have a proposition.

621
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:09,517
No.

622
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,503
Whatever it is, no.

623
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,624
She used a bicycle stamp,

624
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:15,645
and you said that she
was sentimental, right?

625
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:17,959
I bet they went to that
park and rented bikes

626
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:19,262
from Rita's little old man.

627
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:20,639
- Schwinns.
- Schwinns!

628
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,101
Oh! Schwinns.

629
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:26,430
I propose... We go to the park tomorrow,

630
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,002
on our lunch break, and talk to him.

631
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,149
This is...

632
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,478
Highly irregular.

633
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:33,224
We're looking for clues in a love letter

634
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:35,083
that aren't all going to be in the letter.

635
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:37,011
Yeah, and some of us could
really use some fresh air.

636
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,730
Yeah, Oliver!

637
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:45,770
Are you in or are you out?

638
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:01,491
[Sighs]: Oh. Oh, no.

639
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:03,509
I can't believe this.

640
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,488
He used to sit right here and
now he's been replaced by...

641
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:08,430
By this.

642
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,786
Another dreadful example
of unnecessary automation.

643
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:13,896
Well, shall we continue?

644
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,318

I'd grab the rope, but...

676
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:53,051

expecting me to even try.

So do it today.

685
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:15,699
What?

00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,601
Swing! What are you waiting for?

687
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:19,469

00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:16,358
So, am I ever gonna see
any of these pictures?

727
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:20,956
I mean, if we're not
gonna see each other again,

728
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,286
you could at least upload them

729
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,129
to the Charlie-and-Kelly website.

730
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,423
Oh, now you want me to break the rule?

731
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,956
Why do you like taking pictures?

732
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,328
Uh, let me see.

733
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:34,371
Well, um...

734
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:35,939
I know, in some cultures,

735
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,941
people think taking a
photograph of something

736
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:40,010
is like stealing a piece of its soul.

737
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:41,845
But for me,

738
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:46,649
taking a picture of someone
or something is a way to...

739
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,036
I don't know... To honor a soul.

740
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:51,023
It's my way of saying,

741
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:53,060
"here you are, tree...

742
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:55,633
Here you are, sky...

743
00:31:56,757 --> 00:31:58,241
Here you are, Charlie."

744
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:02,139
And... For just a moment

745
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:06,112
I get to stop time and really see you.

746
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,534

[Chuckles]

748
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:24,405
What? What are you thinking?

749
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:29,893
I'm just reading this article here

750
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:33,244
about "Roger Piperson, age 61,"

751
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,626
a baker who won the lottery last week.

752
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:39,008
I bet everybody thinks

753
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,776
he's the luckiest guy in the world.

754
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:42,712
And yesterday, I would have, too.

755
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:44,180
But today,

756
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:47,249
I think the luckiest guy in the world

757
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:49,301
is me.

758
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:56,726
Click.

759
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,594
[Norman]: Uh, on the
other side of this park,

760
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:01,010
there is an exact replica
of Martha Washington's garden

761
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:02,416
at Mount Vernon, Virginia.

762
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,541
I'm a direct descendant of
George Washington's accountant.

763
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't see the purpose in
continuing this field trip.

764
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,511
Just a little bit longer, Oliver, please?

765
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:15,935
Just read a little bit more.

766
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:18,510
There's got to be something in
that letter that will help us

767
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:20,379
if we put ourselves in
Charlie and Kelly's place.

768
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,445
I am not going to swing across the creek.

769
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:23,780
Fine.

770
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,630
And tomorrow, everything
goes back to normal.

771
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,205
Mm-hmm. If that's what
you consider normal.

772
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,902
[Sighs]

773
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,837
"I wanted to tell you everything

774
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,138
right then, Charlie... "

775
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,741
<i>But I didn't want to break the spell."</i>

776
00:33:38,743 --> 00:33:41,326
[Kelly]: "I've always been good
at putting off the hard stuff."

777
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:43,813
[Shutter snaps]

778
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:46,699
I think we ought to do something.

779
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,250
Something to commemorate this day.

780
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,352
Something that makes a difference.

781
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,737
We could get married.

782
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,356
Tempting, but I don't
marry on the first date.

783
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:56,125
Good point.

784
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,526
Alright. Uh...

785
00:33:57,528 --> 00:33:59,195
Let's see.

786
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:01,271
I got it!

787
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:02,990
You saved my life today.

788
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,669
Let's save some more.

789
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,211
[Kelly]: You want to give blood?

790
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:09,355
Yeah. They give you cookies,

791
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:12,015
and you get to lie down, and it's free.

792
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:14,692
I don't really give blood anymore, so.

793
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:17,054
Come on! They do it once
a year here in the park

794
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,229
and it makes you feel great.

795
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:21,101
You won't swing across a creek,
but needles are no problem?

796
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,445
I know. Go figure.

797
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:23,844
I used to do it all the time in college.

798
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,613
I think I still have my old donor card...

799
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,682
What's the matter?

800
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,757
Oh, man. I think I, uh...

801
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:34,215
I think I lost my wallet.

802
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:37,215
[Kelly sighs]

803
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:41,515
I can't believe you lost your job
and your wallet on the same day.

804
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,572
Found your button, though.

805
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:47,441
To be accurate, I quit my job.

806
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:49,677
I did lose my wallet,

807
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,879
but I found the girl of my dreams,

808
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:54,565
so I think it all balances out.

809
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,762
Except...

810
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,798
When I wake up tomorrow morning

811
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,967
and realize that I lost the girl.

812
00:35:07,423 --> 00:35:09,791
I'm sorry, Charlie, it just...

813
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:12,360
It has to be this way.

814
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:15,909
Promise me...

815
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,782
You'll go home tonight,

816
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:20,447
and you'll sew this
button back on your blazer

817
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,179
and you'll find yourself
the job of your dreams

818
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,423
and you'll meet somebody wonderful

819
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:28,326
and have lots of babies and grandchildren,

820
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,658
and make dozens of paper boats for them

821
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:34,292
every time you take them
for walks in the park,

822
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,229
and when you set them sailing,

823
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,497
you'll think of me.

824
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,026
Or you could come by tomorrow
and sew the button on yourself.

825
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:53,211
[Chuckles sadly]

826
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:56,047
Are you trying to tell me you can't sew?

827
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:59,716
I don't think I could do
anything without you now, Kelly.

[*]

829
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,181
One more thing.

830
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:20,017
Okay? Just one more.

831
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,454
If you swing really high...

832
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:26,090
Over the trees...

833
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:28,826
You see the big apartment building?

834
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:29,910
I see it.

835
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:31,879
Okay, now look to the right.

836
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,614
You see the rooftops?

837
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,950
You see 'em?

838
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:37,785
- Yep!
- Okay.

839
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:41,050
Now look for a blue gate
with a flag above it.

840
00:36:42,424 --> 00:36:44,742
Yes! There it is. I saw it.

841
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,860
That's me. The blue gate.

842
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:48,095
That's where I live.

843
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:50,097
Char... You're breaking the rule!

844
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,699
Yeah, well, you're breaking my heart.

845
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:53,967
Come on, promise me that tomorrow morning

846
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:56,403
I'm gonna wake up, and you'll
be sitting on my front steps.

847
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:57,938
Charlie, I...

848
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,306
You're not comin' down until you do!

849
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,838
[Kelly yelps and laughs]

850
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,354
Higher!

851
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,181
- There it is!
- What? The blue gate?

852
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:14,111
Yeah! The blue gate.

853
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:18,829
Let's go.

854
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:19,864
Wait!

855
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,532
Did Kelly go?

856
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:23,901
Did she show up tomorrow... Last year?

857
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:26,169
It's not up to us to decide what...

859
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,840
"And then even though I wanted to come back

860

and find you there,

861

waiting for me on the
steps by the blue gate,

862
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:34,428
I couldn't."

863
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,480
Ohh. That's very disappointing.

864
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:37,948
"But I can explain.

With all my talk about courage,

866
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:43,331
you were the one who
took the big leap yesterday

and now it's my turn.

868
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,435
I'm going to do what I have
to do to get myself well.

869
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:48,857
If it works,

870
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,839
let's meet a year from today,

871
00:37:52,548 --> 00:37:55,090
on the 26th, and we'll
go on a second date.

872
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:59,297
But if I'm not there waiting
for you at the bridge at 6:00,

873
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:01,927
you'll know it's only
because the leap I had to make

874
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:03,568
was just too far.

875
00:38:04,163 --> 00:38:05,963
Whatever happens, Charlie,

876
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:08,949
sew this button on and
go out into the world.

877
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:11,969
And if you ever want to
spend that day with me again,

878

just remember how it started.

The 23rd. Oh, wow...

00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:28,686
Charlie has no idea they're
supposed to meet in three days.

884

That's assuming she took the leap...

885
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:33,807

follow procedure,

910
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:46,996
We re-address it and re-package it

911
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:48,098

912
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,500

opened in the first place.

of protocol enough already.

incomprehensible twist of fate,

00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,922
it takes the U.S. post
office more than three days

to deliver a simple letter?

923
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,660

924

just leave her there,

I admire your passion, Ms. Mclnerney,

revive a dead letter

green envelope out of there,

instead of that pink one?

943
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,631
Then Charlie and Kelly would
never have had a chance.

944
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,501

whole truth about a letter

Ms. Mclnerney,

does makes a difference.

to glean the truth from a lost letter,

955

and tomorrow, because we
have done our work well,

delivered to Mr. Riggs...

I'm going to have to confiscate this.

1088
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:45,915
Confiscate away, honey.

1089
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,486
Thank you.

1090
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,085
What?

1091
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:54,390
[Sighs quietly]

1092
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:57,124
What are you doing with that
letter? You can't just...

1093
00:47:57,996 --> 00:47:59,629
Read it.

1094
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:01,464
[*]

1095
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:03,604
[Norman]: What do you mean he's in jail?

1096
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:06,455
I mean his neighbor wrote
"not at this address. In jail."

1097
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:08,123
On the envelope.

1098
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:11,343
You intercepted the letter
at the point of delivery?

1099
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:13,671
Yep. Although 25 minutes earlier...

1100
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:15,064
She had tendered her resignation,

1101
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:17,132
so, technically, she
had yet to be reinstated

1102
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:18,300
as a government servant.

1103
00:48:18,325 --> 00:48:20,903
It's sheer luck I was there
in time to intercept it.

1104
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:23,873
Luck is the religion of the lazy.

1105
00:48:24,255 --> 00:48:27,398
Guess what? I found it.
I stopped it just in time.

1106
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:29,122
Your card.

1107
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,543
It's from your dad, right?

1108
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:38,019
And the handwriting is
male, late 40s, early 50s.

1109
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:42,722
Aren't you going to open it?

1110
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:43,823
Maybe later.

1111
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:45,791
Gotta find Charlie Riggs first.

1112
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:47,860
Charlie? Kelly's Charlie?

1113
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:49,836
Yeah, Charlie-in-jail-
for-something Charlie.

1114
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:51,321
Knew there was something
fishy about that guy.

1115
00:48:51,352 --> 00:48:52,932
Shh! I'm googling.

1116
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:55,267
But "Charlie Riggs" is such a nice name.

1117
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,836
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1118
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:58,771
Do you remember the Baker Roger Piperson,

1119
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,323
who won the lottery?

1120
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:02,041
He's "the luckiest man in the world."

1121
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:04,243
Roger Piperson was murdered...

1122
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:07,213
By a man named Charlie Riggs.

1123
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:10,449
[*]

1124
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:16,006
It's impossible.

1125
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:18,042
Wait! I remember.

1126
00:49:18,044 --> 00:49:20,344
I read an article about
the baker in Park Hill.

1127
00:49:20,346 --> 00:49:22,969
He was going to give away
all of his lottery money

1128
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:25,389
to an orphanage in Loreto
Heights, where he grew up.

1129
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:27,588
They said that he was
a real self-made man.

1130
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,923
He used to give cookies

1131
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,725
to the kids every day after school.

1132
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:31,692
But then Charlie...

1133
00:49:31,694 --> 00:49:33,561
Not Charlie.

1134
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:34,862
Right!

1135
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,131
Someone, somebody, went into the bakery,

1136
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:39,167
shot the baker, and...

1137
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:42,443
And what?

1138
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,478
I stopped reading.

1139
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,547
It was just too sad.

1140
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:49,533
Well, I don't believe it.

1141
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:51,218
Not our Charlie.

1142
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,220
[Oliver]: He's not "our Charlie."

1143
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:54,354
And if it's true,

1144
00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:56,657
then perhaps Kelly made the right decision

1145
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:57,725
when she decided to walk away.

1146
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,061
I can't believe you just said that.

1147
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:03,253
I know you want these two to be happy...

1148
00:50:03,255 --> 00:50:04,187
No. Wait. Here it is.

1149
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:06,697
Detective Arthur Kimsey of
the Criminal Investigation Unit

1150
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:08,925
<i>said it was the shortest
murder investigation</i>

1151
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:10,794
in his 12 years on the force."

1152
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:12,216
[Detective]: We just went to his house

1153
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:13,689
<i>and waited for him to come home."</i>

1154
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,248
[Reporter]: According to Detective Kimsey,

1155
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,633
Riggs was easily apprehended

1156
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:18,001
because he not only matched

1157
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:19,502
<i>the description of the alleged gunman,</i>

1158
00:50:19,504 --> 00:50:20,637
<i>but also because,</i>

1159
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:22,539
<i>in his haste to escape the scene,</i>

1160
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,674
<i>he dropped his wallet
and identification behind.</i>

1161
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:27,043
Oh, no. It is our Charlie.

1162
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:28,478
Ah, he's not bad-lookin'.

1163
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,380
[Shane]: "Riggs was taken
into custody and charged

1164
00:50:30,382 --> 00:50:31,515
with second-degree murder

1165
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:33,543
during the commission of an armed robbery.

1166
00:50:33,986 --> 00:50:35,353
He's pleaded "not guilty"

1167
00:50:35,423 --> 00:50:37,806
and remains incarcerated without bail,

1168
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:39,089
and is awaiting trial."

1169
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:41,424
Well...

1170
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:44,511
There it is.

1171
00:50:44,513 --> 00:50:46,013
[Lid claps shut]

1172
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:51,070
Kelly didn't say anything in her
letter about him being clumsy.

1173
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:53,449
[Oliver]: Or homicidal.

1174
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:56,269
Wait. What date was that?

1175
00:50:56,271 --> 00:50:59,205
Last year. I think this month...

1176
00:50:59,207 --> 00:51:00,976
Oh... wow.

1177
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:03,734
Oliver. It happened a year ago on the 26th.

1178
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:07,890
I need a Yoo-hoo.

1179
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:09,712
What's going on?

1180
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:11,046
Norman, don't you get it?

1181
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:12,381
Charlie was with Kelly that day,

1182
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,316
all day, and he dropped his wallet,

1183
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:16,686
so whoever picked it up
probably shot the Baker.

1184
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:18,220
He's a lot taller than
I thought he would be.

1185
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:19,221
I was in a jail once.

1186
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:20,623
I was visiting a cousin

1187
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,291
who was doing 10 days in
quartzville, Arizona...

1188
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,043
- ... for tipping cows.
- Norman, please stop talking...

1189
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:26,162
And I mean it from the very
bottom of my heart, okay?

1190
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:29,532
"Riggs faces life in
lottery-winner shooting."

1191
00:51:29,534 --> 00:51:32,194
Oh, my gosh! He goes to trial next week.

1192
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:33,509
What are we going to do?

1193
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,382
We're going to re-address the letter

1194
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,084
to Charlie, care of the county jail.

1195
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:40,073
That's it? He needs our help!

1196
00:51:40,073 --> 00:51:41,997
Well, clearly, he needs someone's help,

1197
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:43,356
like his lawyer, for example,

1198
00:51:43,356 --> 00:51:44,639
but the U.S. postal system

1199
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:46,474
is not in the habit of defending murderers.

1200
00:51:46,476 --> 00:51:47,942
He's not a murderer!

1201
00:51:47,944 --> 00:51:49,544
That's right, and we know that,
so we need to do something.

1202
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,312
Well, the truth is, we don't know anything

1203
00:51:52,337 --> 00:51:54,241
- beyond what's in the letter.
- Voilà !

1204
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:55,130
What is this?

1205
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,696
This is Jerry Polevich,
Charlie's public defender,

1206
00:51:57,732 --> 00:51:59,899
and he happens to be on a dating website.

1207
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:01,834
"Jerry Polevich, age 47.

1208
00:52:01,836 --> 00:52:06,305
Education: Degree in law from
the north Denver valley college.

1209
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,042
Religion: None.

1210
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:10,967
Languages: 'What's wrong with English?'

1211
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:12,218
Status: Divorced."

1212
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,924
There's no surprise there, is there?

1213
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:17,621
Likes: Golf, cooking, golf, eating, golf,

1214
00:52:17,623 --> 00:52:18,889
barbecuing, golf

1215
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:21,058
and anything from the mile-high deli.

1216
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,419
Life's ambition: To quit the law

1217
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:27,448
and buy the bunker-shot grill
at pinecobble country club."

1218
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,433
That's quite enough
"googling," Ms. Mclnerney.

1219
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:30,835
I'm calling the receptionist

1220
00:52:30,837 --> 00:52:32,875
so I can set up a meeting
to sit down face-to...

1221
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:33,874
<i>[Jerry]: Polevich.</i>

1222
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:35,241
Jerry Polevich?

1223
00:52:35,243 --> 00:52:37,394
Jerry Polevich, Esquire?

1224
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,213
If personal injury's your
plan, Polevich is your man.

1225
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:42,082
Uh, I will keep that in mind, sir,

1226
00:52:42,084 --> 00:52:45,051
but I'm not calling to
solicit your services.

1227
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:47,354
I am calling from the
main post office down...

1228
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:48,722
Ah! Great! You found 'em!

1229
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:50,307
I don't know how you
guys could manage to lose

1230
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,893
60 pounds of mail-order steak on dry ice.

1231
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:55,862
The United States post office
does not "lose" things, sir.

1232
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:57,414
Look, if-if you don't wanna sue anybody,

1233
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:58,632
you don't got my steak,

1234
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,966
what do ya want?

1235
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,817
Well, I'm calling with information

1236
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:05,622
- about the man who killed...
- Allegedly!

1237
00:53:05,624 --> 00:53:08,890
Allegedly killed Roger Piperson.

1238
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:09,991
Who?

1239
00:53:09,993 --> 00:53:11,192
Charles Riggs.

1240
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:13,595
You are his public defender, are you not?

1241
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:16,848
Charles Riggs? Well,
then who's Roger Piperson?

1242
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,233
The Baker!

1243
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:20,796
Who was unfortunately
dispatched... last year.

1244
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,438
Oh, right, right, right,
right. The Piperson bakery.

1245
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,672
Oh! I loved that bakery!

1246
00:53:24,674 --> 00:53:26,443
I haven't had a decent bearclaw since.

1247
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:27,758
What about him?

1248
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,375
Well, I have proof...

1249
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:31,194
A letter detailing
Charles Riggs' activities

1250
00:53:31,196 --> 00:53:32,812
the day the Baker was dispatched

1251
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:35,398
which proves his innocence incontroverti...

1252
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,983
Look, look, pal. Anybody
can write a letter.

1253
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:38,735
Do you got any pictures? Video?

1254
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:40,303
No.

1255
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:41,671
Well, that's what I'm gonna need.

1256
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:44,268
You get me my visuals
and my 60 pounds of steak,

1257
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:45,816
then we'll talk.

1258
00:53:46,611 --> 00:53:48,824
You still wanna do nothing, Oliver?

1259
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:51,598
You wanna leave it up
to the crack legal mind

1260
00:53:51,598 --> 00:53:53,031
of a man who buys his

1261
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:55,116
No, of course not, but
we have no alternative.

1262
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:56,851
Wrong.

1263
00:53:57,683 --> 00:54:00,292
The other day, you said
that we are responsible

1264
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:01,962
for what little truth we have.

1265
00:54:02,164 --> 00:54:03,031
Well, the truth is,

1266
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,406
Charlie Riggs is innocent
and we can prove it.

1267
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,788
- Possibly.
- Possibly? Probably!

1268
00:54:07,988 --> 00:54:09,454
And we have a moral obligation

1269
00:54:09,557 --> 00:54:10,593
to at least try.

1270
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:12,126
What are you proposing?

1271
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:15,402
We know Polevich won't do
anything with the letter, right?

1272
00:54:15,404 --> 00:54:18,772
But if we deliver the
letter to Charlie in person,

1273
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:21,909
maybe he can tell us something
that we can do to help him.

1274

Charlie needs this letter.

1275

He needs to keep that date with Kelly

1276
00:54:28,972 --> 00:54:30,472
and he needs a friend.

1277
00:54:31,528 --> 00:54:33,193
I know it's risky, but...

1278

The pictures have to
be out there somewhere.

We didn't try hard enough.

- We could have...
- No.

We tried, we did our best. Now,

1450

we have to do what we know how to do

1451

Forgive me for not keeping
you in the loop, Andrea.

Yeah.

Too bad you weren't in mine.

You're darn right it won't happen again,

another department meeting.

"Lost its viability."

Hey, Norman, do you wanna dance?

Uh... could we play shuffleboard instead?

01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,325
Okay.

1487
01:03:53,822 --> 01:03:55,556
She has a terrible crush on him.

1488

You know that, right?

1489
01:03:57,714 --> 01:03:58,859
That's very insightful,

1490
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:02,330
considering she absolutely terrifies him.

1491
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,022
Yeah, well, love is funny.

1492
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,957
Odd, perhaps.

1493
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:08,488
But funny?

1494
01:04:09,466 --> 01:04:11,050

to the national postal museum

1504
01:04:39,264 --> 01:04:40,263
two years ago.

1505
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:43,556
It was glorious.

1506
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:47,838
I can't say that I ever went.

1507
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,572
I got lost in it.

1508
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:51,641
Did you go alone?

1509
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:52,868
No.

1510
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:54,711
Well, sort of.

1511
01:04:54,713 --> 01:04:56,680
I took my wife.

1512
01:04:57,702 --> 01:05:00,175
A lovely person whose interests

1513
01:05:00,175 --> 01:05:03,505
extended far beyond the
written word to, shall we say...

1514
01:05:04,646 --> 01:05:06,156
The somewhat decadent.

1515
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:12,418
We were standing in front
of the pony express exhibit.

1516
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,587
I turned around,

1517
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:17,119
she wasn't there anymore.

1518
01:05:19,756 --> 01:05:22,095
I looked everywhere for her.

1519
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,278
I finally gave up.

1520
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:29,436
I went back to the holiday inn express

1521
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:32,910
and, um, waited for her.

1522
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:35,610
She never came.

1523
01:05:38,207 --> 01:05:39,640
I was just about to call the police

1524
01:05:39,642 --> 01:05:40,875

1525
01:05:40,877 --> 01:05:43,410
that little red light
blinking on the phone.

1526
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:49,851
She left this message.

1527
01:05:49,853 --> 01:05:52,514
She said that she was tired

1528
01:05:52,514 --> 01:05:55,056
of being married to a government official,

1529
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,573
and she figured, since
she was in Washington, DC,

1530
01:05:58,636 --> 01:06:00,736
it was the closest she
had ever been to Paris,

1531
01:06:00,738 --> 01:06:03,194
so she was getting on a
plane and moving to France.

Not yet.

1537
01:06:21,836 --> 01:06:24,303
The last thing she said on her message was,

1538
01:06:24,704 --> 01:06:26,738
"I'll send you my forwarding address.

1539
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,228
<i>Au revoir."</i>

1540
01:06:28,426 --> 01:06:29,851
Actually, she pronounced it

1541
01:06:30,437 --> 01:06:31,928
"or rev-or."

1542
01:06:32,408 --> 01:06:37,250
But I assume her accent's
much improved by now.

1543
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:44,305
Don't you think you've
waited for her long enough?

Sadly, I lack the proper luggage.

Or you could just give me her name

a card and some money.

Charlie kept that date

There he is sailing the boat.

1618
01:10:33,401 --> 01:10:35,737
What about Charlie and the bloodmobile?

1619
01:10:35,762 --> 01:10:37,011
They have to be in the same picture

1620
01:10:37,013 --> 01:10:38,496
in order to establish time and place.

1621
01:10:38,644 --> 01:10:40,615
Okay, there he is,
swinging across the creek,

1622
01:10:40,617 --> 01:10:41,783
landing on the other side,

1623
01:10:41,785 --> 01:10:43,117
there he is running.

1624
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,286
No, that's the jogger
that ran into Charlie!

1625
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:46,738
No, wait. Or is that Charlie?

1626
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,539
No. That's the jogger. It just
sort of looks like Charlie.

1627
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,208
It looks a lot like Charlie.

1628
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,660
Same hair, same build.

1629
01:10:52,662 --> 01:10:54,128
So Charlie was knocked down by someone

1630
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:55,413
who looked a great deal like him.

1631
01:10:55,415 --> 01:10:57,665
Right before he lost his wallet.

1632
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:21,141
There! There he is! He's on the move.

1633
01:11:21,462 --> 01:11:23,585
Well, get in! Come on.

- Ow.

01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:42,168
Okay, here we go.

1639
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:43,253
Sorry!

1640
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,624
There he is... 1:00.

1641
01:11:45,316 --> 01:11:46,816
Hang on, Rita!

1642
01:11:48,386 --> 01:11:50,087
Hey! Ho!

1643
01:11:50,089 --> 01:11:51,288
You jerk.

1644
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,456
What are you doing?

1645
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:53,824
Sorry, sir.

1646
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:55,656
The 18th hole is currently off-limits

1647
01:11:55,656 --> 01:11:57,372
due to some suspicious
ground squirrel activity.

1648
01:11:57,374 --> 01:11:58,673
What the hell is going on?

1649
01:11:58,675 --> 01:12:00,169
A moment of your time, Jerry.

1650
01:12:00,169 --> 01:12:01,575
Who are you people?

1651
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:03,149
Loyal Americans dedicated

1652
01:12:03,204 --> 01:12:04,600
to the highest standard of mail delivery.

1653
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,959
We have some information
of the utmost importance

1654
01:12:06,984 --> 01:12:07,983
we want to bring to your attention.

1655
01:12:08,383 --> 01:12:09,916
I gotta sink this putt

1656
01:12:09,918 --> 01:12:11,651
and be back in court in half an hour.

1657
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:14,654
We have a double-double Reuben on rye

1658
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:15,989
from the mile-high deli

1659
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:17,774
that says you wanna
hear what we have to say.

1660
01:12:17,776 --> 01:12:19,259
[Oliver]: You are the public defender

1661
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:20,693
for Mr. Charles Riggs,

1662
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:23,212
and this is the information
that proves he is innocent.

1663
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,626
You're the guy that called me.

1664
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:29,474
Photos taken the same
day the crime took place.

1665
01:12:30,274 --> 01:12:33,396
Note the bloodmobile, a
once-a-year afternoon event.

1666
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:35,476
Please pay particular
attention to this photo

1667
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:38,951
of a man who bears a remarkable
resemblance to Mr. Charles Riggs.

1668
01:12:38,951 --> 01:12:42,490
Please note his hand suspiciously
close to Mr. Riggs' back pocket.

1669
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:43,564
I submit to you

1670
01:12:43,589 --> 01:12:45,622
that he is stealing the very wallet

1671
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:47,113
that the murderer of Roger Piperson

1672
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:49,218
purposely dropped at
the scene of the crime...

1673
01:12:49,218 --> 01:12:50,467
That's ridiculous.

1674
01:12:50,469 --> 01:12:52,185
I know it seems a bit far-fetched,

1675
01:12:52,187 --> 01:12:53,625
until I point out to you

1676
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:55,682
the man accosting Mr. Riggs,

1677
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:56,861
removing his wallet,

1678
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,458
is Eugene mossley,

1679
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,326
the cousin

1680
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:01,161
and sole living relative

1681
01:13:01,163 --> 01:13:02,329
of the deceased millionaire.

1682
01:13:02,331 --> 01:13:04,531
Look him up. He's on the Internet.

1683
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:05,665
Oh.

1684
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:06,867
Follow the money, Mr. Polevich,

1685
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:08,963
and I imagine you will
find the murder weapon

1686
01:13:08,988 --> 01:13:11,338
and a man who has just
inherited the millions

1687
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,440
his cousin had promised to an orphanage.

1688
01:13:13,442 --> 01:13:16,435
Okay, well, I'm gonna give, uh, all this

1689
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:17,757
some real thought.

1690
01:13:17,968 --> 01:13:21,422
No. You're gonna give that
to the district attorney

1691
01:13:21,422 --> 01:13:23,872
and you're gonna get the charges
against Mr. Riggs dropped.

1692
01:13:23,872 --> 01:13:24,938
Immediately.

1693
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,907
What is that? Some kind of threat?

1694
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:28,609
No.

1695
01:13:28,611 --> 01:13:30,527
But this is.

1696
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:32,746
Have you ever seen what
happens to Montana steaks

1697
01:13:32,748 --> 01:13:35,749
when they've been rerouted
for additional postage?

1698
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,387
[Takes a deep breath, sighs]

1699
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:45,592
Well played, sir.

[*]

1701
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:03,960
That's right, Parker.

1702
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:05,818
The remarkable way in
which this new evidence

1703
01:14:05,843 --> 01:14:07,673
came to light certainly contributed to

1704
01:14:07,687 --> 01:14:09,365
to Riggs' speedy release, which

1705
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:12,663
we expect to take place... Any minute now.

1706
01:14:14,293 --> 01:14:15,660
So this is it?

1707
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:18,296

Before you know it,

1709
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,758
we'll be back at the D.L.O.,
packing our proverbial bags,

1710

1717
01:14:43,163 --> 01:14:45,664
Before it's all over, I'd like to know why.

1718
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:49,251
Shane Mclnerney, why are
you such a revolutionary?

1719
01:14:50,763 --> 01:14:51,924
Well...

1720
01:14:52,549 --> 01:14:54,631
Since you called me by my real name,

1721
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,857
I'm going to tell you, Mr. O'Toole.

1722
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,234
I always followed the rules.

1723
01:15:01,236 --> 01:15:03,019
Drove the speed limit.

1724
01:15:03,021 --> 01:15:05,183
Always parked at least five feet away

1725
01:15:05,249 --> 01:15:06,582
from a fire hydrant,

1726
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:09,025
never tore the tags off furniture.

1727
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,165
So...

1728
01:15:16,171 --> 01:15:20,003
One night, when I went to a hospital,

1729
01:15:20,005 --> 01:15:21,271
and they told me

1730
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:22,606
that visiting hours were over,

1731
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:25,759
I said "thank you. I
will come back tomorrow."

1732
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,582
But when tomorrow came...

1733
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:33,550
I didn't have anyone to come back to.

1734
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,355
My dad had died in the night,

1735
01:15:39,628 --> 01:15:43,400
and I never got to the chance
to work things out with him.

1736
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,413
You two were at odds?

1737
01:15:49,803 --> 01:15:52,200
He had called a couple of months before,

1738
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:55,446
and said that he was sick

1739
01:15:55,471 --> 01:15:57,417
and he wanted to spend my birthday with me

1740
01:15:57,442 --> 01:15:59,376
before he died.

1741
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:01,998
I said

1742
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:05,466
that he had been gone so long,

1743
01:16:05,468 --> 01:16:07,796
that he was dead to me already.

1744
01:16:12,877 --> 01:16:14,792
But he was your dad.

1745
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:17,395
I'm sure he knew you didn't mean it.

1746
01:16:19,278 --> 01:16:20,972
He knew that I did.

1747
01:16:23,724 --> 01:16:25,003
Interesting.

1748
01:16:26,323 --> 01:16:28,039
What?

1749
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:32,623
You may have surmised by
now, uh, I am a man a faith.

1750
01:16:33,365 --> 01:16:36,279
It's true. He sings in the church choir.

1751

but you're something
of a believer yourself.

1755
01:16:46,366 --> 01:16:49,022
What about me could possibly
give you any indication

1756
01:16:49,047 --> 01:16:50,814
that I believe in God and redemption

1757
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,272
and all that stuff?

1758
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:54,354
Well, if you don't,

1759
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:56,787
you should throw that card away right now.

1760
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:58,721
Go ahead.

1761
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:02,779
Yet there it is, still in your purse.

1762
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,921
You're hoping there's redemption in there.

1763
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,887
You're hoping that

1764
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:15,092
there's something more
than $20 in that envelope.

1765
01:17:17,021 --> 01:17:18,762
You're hoping...

1766
01:17:19,826 --> 01:17:21,692
That when you finally find the courage

1767
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:24,121
to trust that your father
never stopped loving you,

1768
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:28,710
and you tear open that pain
you've been carrying around,

1769
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:32,236
there's forgiveness inside.

1770
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:39,510
And hope like that, my dear Shane...

1771
01:17:41,446 --> 01:17:44,148

Charlie.

What are you doing here?

Well, we had a date, right?

I-I know, but I...

I tried to find you,

1814
01:20:13,098 --> 01:20:14,564
I did find you, at the research center,

1815
01:20:14,566 --> 01:20:16,199
but they said nobody survived the trials.

1816
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:17,851
I never finished the trials.

1817
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:19,536
I only signed up because it was free.

1818
01:20:19,538 --> 01:20:21,671
I-I was too afraid to go home to Boston

1819

You were in Boston this entire time?

That is Kelly, right?

1825
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:38,055
Yes, Norman, I believe it is.

1826
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:39,384
I knew it!

1827
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:42,220
I knew she couldn't actually be gone.

1828
01:20:42,222 --> 01:20:43,721
I don't understand.

1829
01:20:43,723 --> 01:20:45,590
I thought she was
supposed to be, you know...

Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet.
