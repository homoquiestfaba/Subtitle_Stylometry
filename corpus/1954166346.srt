00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,370
Good morning, Most Industries.
How may I direct your call?

Samantha Walker, please.

177
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,167
I'm sorry, can you please
hold for one moment?

178
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,991
I thank you for holding,
how may I direct your call?

179
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,301
Yeah, I need to talk
to a Samantha Walker.

180
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,746
Can I have your name, please?

181
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,390
Is there a Samantha Walker
in your department?

182
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,560
Miss Walker no longer works for us.

183
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,522
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

184
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,425
I need your address, please,
of your corporate offices.

I have an appointment scheduled
with Most Industries today.

191
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,480
Yeah, yeah, that's
exactly who it is.

192
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,040
I haven't seen him come by yet.

193
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,441
Well, I like to be early
for these types of things.

194
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,484
You know what it's like.

195

You know what they say, early
bird gets the worm and all that.

Just sign in there for me, please.

Hi, yeah, good morning.

my daughter, Samantha Walker.

Do you recognize her?

206
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,793
Sorry, Most Industries,
how may I direct your call?

207
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,154
You're the girl
I spoke with earlier.

208
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,613
One moment, please.

209
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,450
I'm sorry, Mr. Schuuster isn't
meant to be in the office today,

210
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,744
but if you'd like to leave your number,
I'll be glad to let him now you stopped by.

211
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,971
Well, thanks very much.

212
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,456
Is that his office?

213
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,666
- No, sir, you can't go up there.
- Is that his office?

Sir, you can't go up there!

Sir! You can't just run upstairs!

216
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,677
So I need all those numbers in place.

Uh, yeah, yes, I am.

226

I don't know what's going on here, but let
me just start off with a little apology.

227
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:01,265
See, I got a terribly hectic schedule
today, I'm gonna be tied up.

In the interest of
speeding things up,

229
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,712
what can I do for you?
What are you here for?

230
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,356
You knew my daughter,
Samantha Walker?

231
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,259
Hmm... Is that right?

232
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,361
Yeah, she worked for you.

233
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,031
Well, for at least
this company anyway.

234
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,350
Well, I understand why
you'd think that,

235
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,270
but something you should know is
that I have hundreds of employees

236
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,441
and I guess a pretty large
portion of them I've never met,

237
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,835
and I'm afraid your
daughter is one of them.

238
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,031
Well, gentlemen, you can
leave now. Thank you.

239
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,159
Uh, do me a favor, Saphire should be
sitting right outside that office.

240
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,285
Would you ask him to come in

241
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,221
and show this gentleman down
to human resources, thanks.

242
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,060
And now, Mister, uh, Walker, um,

243
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,146
I've got a webinar presentation.

244
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,148
She was killed over a week ago.

245
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,194
And the body they were gonna
ship back to London wasn't hers.

246
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,906
Your corporate office was one
of the last numbers she called.

247
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,661
Uh, jeez, I'm... I'm...

248
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,791
I'm very sorry to hear about that,
accept my condolences.

249
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,001
I just need some help.

250
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,695

251
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,214

please, I'm begging you.

253
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,244
but if you came here
for those answers from me,

254
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,888
I'm sorry, again, I really am.

255
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,433
I don't know, this city, it's...

256
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,478
I don't know,
it just gets rougher...

257
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,274
It's rotten, especially if you're a pretty,
little blonde, you know? It's just...

258
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,778
I never mentioned the
color of her hair.

259
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,949
I'm sorry, uh... Saphire.

260
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,327
Please, just look at her picture.

261
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,124
That's her. It's a different
girl, it's not Sam.

262
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,465
Sorry.

263
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,677
Can you show him
downstairs, please, guys?

264
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,387
All right.

265
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,849

00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,767

00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,620
- There's one other thing.
- It's time to leave.

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,440
You want to watch that hand, mate.
You might just lose it.

272
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,959
From a proper gent like you?
I don't think so.

00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,587

Down! Get on the ground now!

278
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,787
On your knees! Down!

279
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,789

up a guy on assault charges

284
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,024
and immediately contacted us.

285
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,844
Last time I checked,
we were a major crimes unit.

286
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,429
You might want to remind
the Lieutenant that

287
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,305
next time he calls us in
for something like this.

288

KENNEDY: I'll keep that in mind.

289
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,475
The assailant's a British national.

290
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,311
Military contractor,
Iraq, Afghanistan.

291
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,399
Got picked up at the offices of Most
Industries down in Century City.

292
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,359
Apparently he got into
a heated argument

293
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,112
and beat the living daylights
out of the security detail.

294
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,156
Here's the catch. He says
that his daughter was missing

295
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,950
and he was trying to track her down
through her last known employer.

296
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,135
Her name's Samantha Walker.

297
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,497
Our San Pedro victim?

298
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,976
Yeah, told the arresting officers
that they got the wrong girl.

299
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,961
Well, find out if there's
any truth to it.

300
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,102
Have Henderson pull the file
and bring it down here.

301
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,524
- Yeah.
- I'll see what I can get out of him.

302
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,238
Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. Walker.

303
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,951
Long way across the pond, huh?

304
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,038
How long before I can
get out of here?

305
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,959
Well, it's not that simple.

306
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,919
Sure it is.

307
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,489
I know all about the
American justice system.

308
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,758

- Yeah, set the arraignment and let's go.

I can't imagine what
you're going through.

311
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:59,646
Is there anyone in this
town who'll listen to me?

312
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,150
I'm gonna say it again
for the last time.

313
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,885
My daughter's not dead.

314
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,822
The body they were gonna ship
back to London is not Samantha's.

315
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,993
Well, maybe you could tell me
why you busted up that place.

316
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,917
That guy, um, Schuuster...

317
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,111
He's not telling me everything.

318
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,671
He knows Sam.

319
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,925
You're right about that.

320
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,619
See, he gave us a
full statement today

321
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,579
and luckily he's not
gonna press charges.

322
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,747
Well, isn't that big of him?

323
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,667
Well, he's got 12 months from
this date to change his mind,

324
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,853
so if I were you, Mr. Walker,
I'd leave it alone.

325
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,858
Look, I did not go in
there to cause trouble.

326
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,529
All I want to do is find my girl, get her
safe, and bring her home, that's it.

Don't worry, mate. I'll be here.

KENNEDY: All right, I pulled the file.
Here's what we're looking at.

331
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,867
There's not much on her.

332
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,552
Some parking tickets and shit,
until about a month ago,

333
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,223
when she got arrested at a DUI checkpoint
at a bar in the Valley called Cabos.

334
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,583
Look at this picture.

335
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,502
It was taken four weeks ago
the night she got arrested.

336
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,880
And this one was taken
at the crime scene

337
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,861
right after they pulled
the body from the water.

338
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,696
I don't know, it's hard to tell, but
the limey may be telling the truth.

339
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,907
Pull the box.

340

him loose in an hour.

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,346
My contact at the department said
you refused to press charges.

342
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,266
Your contact?

343
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:04,438
That would actually imply that
you knew what you were doing.

344
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,317
With all due respect, with Walker
in jail, it buys us more time.

345
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,777
For what?

346
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,489
I mean, if the girl was alive,

347
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,767
the easiest way to track her

348
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,645
is through the one man that
wants her as badly as we do.

349
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,997
Now that would be a good idea,
don't you think?

350
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,125
Don't worry, I'm on it.

351
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,171
You're on it, you're on it.

352
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:33,075
See, here's the thing.

353
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,595
You were responsible for all
this in the first place.

354
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:41,058
Why in God's name would I let you
go fuck this up over again, why?

355
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,252
We trailed her, from her
apartment to the night club,

356
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,979
exactly where you said she'd be.

357
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,482
Did you get the right girl?

358
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,968
She fit the description
you gave us.

359
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,069
Right.

360
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,539
You know, when I came to
this city, it was in disarray.

361
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,109
Manufacturing was messed up,

362
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,113
corporations were going bankrupt, because
of their problems with the union labor,

363
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,506
but I changed all that.

364
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,283
See I had a lot of cash to lend.

365
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,469
There were borrowers
all around the block.

366
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,746
So basically I...

367
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,058
I painted a new face on the
city, I made it look clean.

368
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,503
So I became Mr. Wonderful,

369
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,189
with love and respect
from just about everyone.

370
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,610
You respect me, Saphire?

371
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,281
See, I don't think so, because now,

372
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,811
for the first time ever, I got
goddamn cops all around my house.

373
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,038
Because of you, you fucking moron!

374
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,216
(SAPHIRE CHOKING)

375
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,725
1881, Castaic. That's
where he used to live.

376
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,170
I want you to go there,
gather up the family,

377
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,438
anybody with the name of Saphire,
make 'em go away.

378
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,203
I would love to hear
you beg for your life,

379
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,944
but you'd bore the shit out of me.

380
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,408
Go on, Baron. Do what I told you.

381
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,024
MICHAEL:
So these are all the effects

382
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,751
that were found on the body of
the woman in the photograph.

383
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,030
It's your daughter's passport, driver's
license and multiple credit cards.

384
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,425
You can see how it
would be an easy miss.

385
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,011
You can justify it all
you want, Detective.

386
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,164
You gotta admit, you and
your men were sloppy.

387
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,248
Oh, is that right?

388
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,600
Yeah.

389
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,566
Sure has a lot of plastic for a
25-year-old, don't you think?

390
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,095
Yeah, well, what can I say?
Girls like to shop, don't they?

391
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,238
Or she got turned upside
down, over-extended.

392
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,117
What's this got to do with the
fact that my daughter's missing?

393
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,161
We're not sure of anything.

394
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,455
Total bollocks, the lot of it.

395
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,109
Let me ask you a
question, Mr. Walker.

396
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,295
When was the last time you
actually spoke to your daughter?

397
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,595
Are we through here, Detective?

398
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,973
My partner will walk you out.

399
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,997
Taxi.

400
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,587
Do you know a bar called Los Cabos?

401
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,797
Here's 100. Keep it running,
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

402
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,343
Fucking slag!

403
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,077
Excuse me.

404
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,540
I said, excuse me!

405
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,293
- Can I get a drink?
- What do you need?

406
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,671
How you doing? I want
a whiskey and a pint.

407
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,989
What?

408
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,158
A whiskey and a pint.

409
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,760
$10.50.

410
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,605
$100, keep it.

411
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,273
Thanks.

412
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,777
Let me get a favor.
You see that girl?

413
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,012
You ever seen her in here?

414
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,947
No, I've never seen
her around here.

415
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,684
You need to take a closer
look at this, try it again.

416
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,825
Have you seen her in here?

417
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,496
Like I said, I've never seen her.

418
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:59,793
Well, she got nicked right outside at
a DUI checkpoint, about a month ago.

419
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,462
They said she was in here.

420
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,255
You a cop?

421
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,575
I'm a long way from home.
I'm just an interested party.

422
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,843
Now, have you seen her?

423
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,638
Haven't seen her.

424
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,693
Give me another one.

425
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,990
And here's another $100 for you.

426
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,955
Now let me jog your fucking memory.

427
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,209
Five foot eight, young blonde,
really easy on the eyes.

428
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,696
She got caught by the police about
a month ago leaving this place.

429
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,172
Now, have you seen her or not?

430
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,101
(GLASS SHATTERING)

431
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,944
Now I've got your attention.

432
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,031
Her name is Samantha Walker.

433
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:19,122
Blonde hair, medium height, she's
missing and she's my daughter.

434
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:25,295
Now, please, please, if there's
anyone who might know anything.

435
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,008
I have $10,000 here in cash.

436
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,721
For any information that might
lead me to her whereabouts.

437
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,351
And the cash is yours, if I
find her where you tell me.

438
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,397
Anyone?

439
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,623
Hey.

440
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,666
I know the girl you're looking for.

441
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,336
Is that right? So where is she?

442
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,364
I tell you that and what's
to guarantee I get paid?

443
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:13,384
Listen to me carefully,
I'm not playing any games here.

444
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,329
But if you are,
I'm gonna be back for this

445
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,264
and you ain't gonna want that,
do you get me?

446
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,143
The Roux. I saw her
there a few times

447
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,397
and then heard she was hanging out with
one of the guys that runs the place.

448
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,551
So let's call this a finder's fee.

449
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,010
You take me to that place,
you get the rest.

450
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,511
That's bullshit, asshole!
I told you what you wanted to know.

451
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,849
If I found her, that was the
offer and that was the deal.

452
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,601
I mean, for all I know, you could be
leading me on some wild fucking chase.

453
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,578
How would I know that?

454
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,125
You want the full 10 grand,
you show me where she is.

455
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,796
Let's go.

456
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,178
MAN: That's our guy. Call it in.

457
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,350
(ENGINE STARTING)

458
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,068
I can't believe I'm doing this.

459
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,087
You could be a serial
killer, for all I know.

460
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,256
Yeah, that's right.

461
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,326
Something tells me you'd still
drive me around all night

462
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,845
if you thought you were gonna
get your hands on my money.

463
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,432
Whatever.

464
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,143
You know my daughter?

465
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,146
That's what I said, I know her.

466
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,483
So where are you taking me?

467
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,612
To the club in Hollywood.

468
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,115
It's an old warehouse they
transitioned a while back.

469
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,726
- Did she work there?
- I don't know.

470
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,937
Well, you said you saw her
in there, make up your mind.

471
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,165
Yeah, I saw her there. I don't
know what she was doing.

472
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,609
I don't, like, keep track
of her, but I saw her.

473
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,528
Look, if this is gonna
be a waste of my time,

474
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,297
you can pull over now and
give me my money back.

475
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,384
- (SIGHS)
- Or you can answer my questions.

476
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,889
What was she involved in and
who was she involved with?

477
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,394
Ricky Cummins, he runs the club.

478
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:33,066
They came in to Cabos a few
times after hours to score.

479
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,235
And how would you know that?

480
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,155
Because I'm the one
that hooked 'em up.

481
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,992
Just get us there.

482
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,964
All right, just be cool in here. These
guys don't respond well to hooligans.

483
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,257
So what does this geezer look like?

484
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,009
Just let me take care of it.
They know me here.

485
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,510
Look, just tell me,
what does he look like?

486
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,846
MARGO: Just wait here for me,
I'm cool with them.

487
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,472
They're not gonna respond to you.

488
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,199
Be cool, okay?

489
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,955
Excuse me, sorry, sorry, excuse me.

490
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,274
- Hi, sorry.
- No dudes.

491
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,734
- MARGO: Excuse me.
- You and your friends are fine.

492
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,485
Hey, Romeo, I need to talk to you.

493
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,653
I'm busy.

494
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,922
Yeah, I see that.
She can take a break.

495
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,784
Hey, you're looking good.

496
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,244
So are you, what's up?

497
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,454
I got this guy with me.

498
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,764
RICKY:
No, no guys. Why are you here?

499
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,209
See the guy in the
brown leather jacket?

500
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,562
He's asking questions
about your girlfriend.

501
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,214
What?

502
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,550
I don't know, look, I just told him
I'd bring him here to talk to you.

503
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,635
Just talk to the guy.

504
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,178
I don't know that guy,

505
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,863
and by the way, no, this is
not happening right now.

506
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,640
- So just...
- Why the fuck did you do that?

507
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,642
MARGO: I told him I'd bring him,
what am I supposed to do?

508
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,726
- For what, though?

00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,269
Mr. Schuuster, you may
still be able to help us.

678
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,314
Have you ever seen
these men before?

679
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,737
Um, no, no,
I can't say that I have.

680
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,934
Listen, I really appreciate you
looking out for my best interest,

681
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,286
but, uh, you'll have to excuse me.

682
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:38,207
There's, uh... I have some special
guests I'd like to attend to.

683
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,793
I don't blame you, yeah.

684
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,446
Tell you what, we'd like to keep
a couple officers out front,

685
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,631
in case this suspect...

686
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,051
No, no, that's really
not necessary.

687
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,911
Just the same.

688
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:55,974
Okay, then, well, you'll just have to
submit a request to the board, uh,

689
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,726
you know that oversees
these estates.

690
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,315
Uh, that would be, I think,
the first Tuesday in every month.

691
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,612
Anyway, you guys have a
nice night, nice meeting you.

692
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,307
SCHUUSTER: Hi, girls.

693
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,933
GIRL: We're happy to have you back.

694
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,078
SCHUUSTER: Did you miss me?
Well, I'm happy to be here.

695
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,040
- You believe one word of that bullshit?
- Not one.

696
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,820
Call Judge Booth, see if we can get
authorization for a surveillance team.

697
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,798
- At this hour?
- Let's wake his lazy ass up.

698
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,079
- Thanks.
- (CHUCKLING)

00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,514
Mmm.

700
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,854
Excuse me for a minute,
will you, honey?

701
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,256
The last contact was
several hours ago.

702
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,358
It seems they've completely
fallen off the grid.

703
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,930
Listen, gather everybody we got.

704
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,515
I want him and her back here.

705
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,392
I don't care if they're
standing or laying down.

706
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,436
I want them back here now, come on.

707
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,871
Yes, sir.

709
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,088
Give me one of those, can you?

710
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,223
Sure.

711
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,628
- That good?
- Thanks.

712
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,729
You're welcome.

714
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,448
Nobody heard nothing.
We should be good for now.

715
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,351
No, if he can find us, so can they.

716
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,412
We... We have to get packed
and moved out of here tonight.

(SIGHS)

718
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,644
I see you've got your
mother's taste in men.

- Present company excluded.
- (WALKER SIGHS)

720
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,523
Easy, there, Dad. It looks
like you've taken a few hits.

721
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,109
Yeah, I have, and you know why?

722
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,056
Because I've been looking for you.

723
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,433
I mean, Sam, what was you thinking,

724
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,202
disappearing like that
without even contacting me.

725
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,895
Don't start with me now.

726
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:25,149
Do you know something?
If your mother was alive...

727
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,377
God, if she was alive, she'd have
been worried sick and panic-stricken.

728
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,462
Hmm, but not you.

729
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,656
That's not what I said.

730
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,133
I haven't heard from you in months.

731
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,138
(SCOFFS) Do you know something?

732
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:44,768
I've been beaten up, nearly
stabbed, shot at, and electrocuted.

733
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,313
All things I'm sure you've
grown accustomed to.

734
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,316
Do you have any idea...

735
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,844
Any idea...

736
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,625
What it's been like for
me this past week?

737
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,933
Not knowing whether you was alive or
dead, who you was with, where you was.

738
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,078
I mean, for all I know, you could have
been lying dead in a ditch somewhere!

739
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:07,332
You know, you never seemed
to care before, so why now?

740
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,421
I'll tell you exactly why.

741
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,508
Because you're the only
one I've got left now.

742
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,305
And like it or not,
you're still my daughter.

743
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,542
Look, listen to me, there...

744
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,604
There was only one thing
I was ever good at.

745
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,315
And being a young dad wasn't it.

746
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,694
But I'm here now for you.

747
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,643
Yeah.

748
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:46,204
Please, you've got to believe me,
I'm not here to judge you.

749
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,374
I don't care what trouble
you've got yourself into.

750
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,004
All I care about is you.

751
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,633
That you're safe and I
can bring you home.

752
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:03,218
(SIGHS)

753
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,629
I needed everyone in my
life to believe I was dead.

754
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,891
Because if he knew I was still
alive, he'd be after me.

755
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,528
This is what he wants.

756
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:29,081
Schuuster created a series of Internet
banks and an online lending solution.

757
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,124
It was a phishing scam.

758
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,694
Every applicant that
went to the website

759
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:37,172
submitted information that
he used to steal their identity.

760
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,134
This is a database that
contains the names

761
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,970
of hundreds of thousands of
people that he's stolen from.

762
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,264
So how has he not been caught?

763
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:50,294
The websites were set up at hosting
facilities all over the country.

764
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,838
The sites would be up for
a week and then removed.

765
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,049
Nothing, not even an imprint
was left to chance.

766
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,968
So how did you get
involved in this?

767
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:02,155
I was hired as a programmer to
manage the root access database.

768
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,991
Good morning, Most Industries.
How may I direct your call?

769
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,103
SAM: Several months ago,
I started finding discrepancies

770
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,374
in the risk scoring that was used to
approve and deny loan applications.

771
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:17,337
So I tracked it through to the
credit services department.

772
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,800
And that's when I met...

773
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,055
What, this fucking geezer?

774
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,306
Jesus, Dad.

775
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,375
I needed more time.

776
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,810
For what?

777
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,311
I broke the code.

778
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,646
(SAM TYPING)

779
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:40,652
SAM: I found a way to back up the database,
so I could get it in the hands of the FBI.

780
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,724
But I knew if they arrested him, he'd still
have the resources to come after me.

781
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,559
So I needed a way out.

782
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,896
Then I created a series
of accounts and identities.

783
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,856
And I funded it with
10 million dollars

784
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,667
that I got from the Most
Industries ledger account.

785
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:02,632
I simply had to merge the new database
into the mainframe host processor.

786
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,203
And once the cards were created,

787
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,723
I could activate the accounts
and transfer the funds.

788
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,185
Schuuster's people were never
prepared for an internal breach.

789
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,421
Are you sure these are clean?

790
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,966
Yeah, I bought the plane
tickets with them today.

791
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,443
So I need your passport.

to transfer the funds...

- Mmm.

794
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:31,661
I knew I only had a few days before
Schuuster found out I was arrested.

795
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:36,082
I was able to get the
accounts activated,

796
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,878
but I didn't have enough
time to transfer the funds.

798
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,165
It's just a small piece of the pie,
nothing that he would even notice.

799
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,625
Then why did he want you dead?

800
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:57,170
(SIGHS) Well, when I was busted,
they caught his cards on me.

801
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,564
And then he knew I
was a risk to him.

802
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,024
And the other girl?

803
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,109
Let me know as soon
as you cash them.

01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,320
- Okay, I will.

Cathy was my roommate.

After I ran from the office,
I had her met up with Ricky.

807
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,653
There wasn't enough time.

808
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,757
So Ricky was the only one that
could still get into the facility.

809
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,637
But it was too late.

810
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,499
So the money's in limbo and
everyone wants it back.

811
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,103
You know, there's still a way
for us to do this clean.

812
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,043
Yeah, well, I don't see that unless
we get inside that building.

up in his panic room in his estate.

(BUZZES)

815
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:58,356
So we don't have to break into the office,
we just have to get into that room.

816
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,166
Yeah, well, how do you
propose we do that?

817
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,918
RICKY: I have an idea.

818
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,548
There is one thing that he
likes better than money.

something, what is it?

01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,974
What? No, no!

01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,184
Come on, it's the only
way we can get inside.

828
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:33,033
I mean, how long do you think it's gonna
be before he finds out you was involved?

829
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,102
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

830
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,913
Here you go, 10 grand.

do better than that, mate.

I'll tell you what I'll do.

Let's make it an even
hundred thousand.

And how is it we still
can't tie the rental car

01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,195
to either Most Industries

Well, tell me again.

who signed for the car,

01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,292
and why is it being declined now?

843
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,836
Credit card was stolen from
