00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,000
Much better, Frank.

176
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,125
I don't go near Choice.
I only do Prime. That's it.

177
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,666
Can I get some more for next Tuesday?

178
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,291
How many you want?

179
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,000
At least five.

180
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,875
[all laugh]

181
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,833
Okay. Five, you got.

182
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,750
[priest speaking Latin]

183
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,375
- Amen.
- [all] Amen.

184
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,000
What the fuck is this?

185
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Tony, I don't...

186
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,166
- What the fuck is this, Frank?
- I don't... I don't know.

187
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,291
[hesitates] I mean...

188
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,625
I don't load the truck.

189
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,250
The loaders
are supposed to load the truck.

190
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,916
Maybe they didn't do their work.
I don't know.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You didn't realize you were
driving a light horse?

192
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,041
No. I just... Nothing. It felt fine.

193
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, come on, Frank. Come on.

194
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,458
[sputtering] I'm telling you. I...

195
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,291
God's truth.
I just don't know what happened.

196
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't know. Maybe some...

197
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,250
[sighs]

198
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,541
- It's empty.
- I know it is.

199
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,041
I know it is.

200
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,750
What are you guys looking at?
Go back to work.

201
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,791
All of youse!

202
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,291
What am I gonna tell the boss?

203
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,208
Well, I'm telling you
that I don't know what's going on.

204
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,000
Just don't look at me
'cause I, you know...

205
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,041
Well, who else can I look at?
This is not gonna be on me, Frank.

206
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,166
I'm telling you right now.

207
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,750
Me, I just drive the truck.
That's all I do.

208
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
[Bill] Okay, Frank Sheeran.
Am I saying that right?

209
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,708
[Frank] Yeah, you said right.

210
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,166
Uh, under the contract,
thanks to Jimmy Hoffa...

211
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,708
management can only fire a driver
on very specific charges.

212
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,125
- So, you ever show up late?
- No.

213
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,958
- Do you have any moving violations?
- No.

214
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,791
- Do you drink on the job?
- No.

215
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,125
You ever hit anybody?

216
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,666
- On the job?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,375
- No.
- Okay.

218
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,666
What about stealing, that ain't grounds?

219
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,250
Well...

220
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,250
can they prove it?

221
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,625
I don't think so.

222
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,333
All right then, we don't have
nothing to worry about.

223
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,541
If they can prove it,

224
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,708
they're just gonna want names from you.
Accomplices.

225
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,875
That's all. You give them
a couple of names, you go home.

226
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,458
Keep your job.

227
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,666
What do you think about that?

228
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,708
- Would you give them names?
- No. No names.

229
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,000
You know, I don't, uh...

230
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,708
I don't care whether you did it or not.

231
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,416
That makes no difference to me.

232
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm here to defend you. Right?

233
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,083
Right.

234
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,666
What, you want to know if I did it or not?

235
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,791
- Well...
- [chuckling]

236
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,208
I'm gonna defend you either way.

237
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,500
Yeah, all right, but...

238
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,958
I, I work hard for them
when I ain't stealing from 'em.

239
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,833
[Bill] Your Honor,
if this was about right or wrong,

240
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,333
the company would have
sought Mr. Sheeran's dismissal.

241
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,416
They didn't.

242
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,125
They only accused Mr. Sheeran

243
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,541
because the company hoped
he could name conspirators,

244
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,791
which he couldn't do
because they don't exist.

245
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,625
They don't exist
because he didn't steal anything.

246
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,250
He didn't steal anything
because he's an exemplary employee,

247
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,666
who in eight years
has never taken a day of sick leave.

248
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,375
The only rule he ever broke
is his own union's,

249
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,708
by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck

250
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,541
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter.

251
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,583
[clerk] All rise.

252
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,666
Court is in session.

253
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,875
[judge] I'm dismissing this case
with a warning.

254
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,333
Yes, Your Honor.

255
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,750
No, no, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

256
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,375
You bring another working man
before this court

257
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,375
with threats instead of evidence,

258
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,750
believe me, you'll be sorry.

259
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,250
If I owned stock in this company,
I would sell it.

260
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,125
[Frank] <i>I don't know how he did it,</i>
<i>and I ain't gonna ask.</i>

261
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,708
<i>All I know is that Bill Bufalino
got me out of a case</i>

262
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,250
<i>where I should never
have gotten away with it.</i>

263
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,583
<i>I should've been down for the count.</i>

264
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,916
People are gonna appreciate
what you did today, Frank.

265
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,041
You know, they got families,
they got kids.

266
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,416
They need those jobs.

267
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,500
[Frank] <i>Instead,</i>
<i>we went out celebrating...</i>

268
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,791
Russell!

269
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,416
[Frank] <i>...and I met</i>
<i>what was gonna turn out to be</i>

270
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
<i>the rest of my life.</i>

271
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,791
You know, I thought that was you
walking in outside.

272
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,416
[Bill] Yeah, yeah, you know,
this is our place.

273
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,750
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

274
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,791
Frank, I want you to meet
my cousin Russell Bufalino.

276
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,541
- How are ya?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

277
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
You helped me with my truck
a couple of months ago.

278
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,958
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
The timing chain.

279
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,750
- Yeah.
- Did you get it fixed?

280
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,500
- I fixed it the next day, yeah.
- [Russell] Attaboy.

281
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,583
- Thanks again.
- Oh, you're welcome.

282
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,166
My pleasure. I'm glad you fixed it.

283
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,125
[imperceptible]

284
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,208
You better watch.

285
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,458
There's a lot of tough guys around here.
Did he tell ya?

286
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,833
[both chuckle]

287
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,375
You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?

288
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,291
No.

289
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,416
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

290
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,583
- [Frank] Okay.
- Thanks, Russell.

291
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,583
Your cousin saved my ass.

292
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,375
I could've lost the whole load.

293
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, he knows
everything about trucks, really.

294
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,916
Yeah, he worked at Canada Dry
for a long time.

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,166
- Vito, how are you?
- Pleasure.

296
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,958
I think, uh... Let's take the booth.

297
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,666
Come on. You're gonna love this.

298
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,041
[Frank] <i>Maybe I didn't know</i>

299
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,500
<i>who Russell Bufalino was back then,</i>

300
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,791
<i>but I'd seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers</i>

301
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,875
<i>to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.</i>

302
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,333
<i>I mean, Bruno, he... he was just made
the new boss of Philadelphia.</i>

303
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,208
<i>He took care of everything
from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.</i>

304
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,458
<i>That, I knew.</i>

305
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,083
<i>And that was all I had to know</i>

306
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,666
<i>to know that Russell Bufalino</i>

307
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,540
<i>was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.</i>

308
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,875
[slow harmonica music playing]

309
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,958
[Frank in Italian]
This bread is very good.

310
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,125
[Russell in Italian] Good, eh?

311
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,958
Where did an Irisher like you
learn to speak Italian?

312
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,375
In Italy - the war.

313
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,583
Ah. Where?

314
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,540
Salerno.

315
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,833
Anzio.

316
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,375
Sicily...

317
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,708
around Catania.

318
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,708
Catania? I'm from Catania.

319
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,208
Yeah? I thought you had
an accent like Catania.

320
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,250
[Russell laughs]

321
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,666
How long were you in the war?

322
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,666
Four years.

323
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,208
411 days in combat...

324
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,875
122 at Anzio.

325
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,375
[in English] Forty-fifth Infantry.

326
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,833
<i>Minchia.</i>

327
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,208
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- Minchia.</i>

328
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,291
[in Italian] Were you afraid of dying?

329
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,750
Always afraid.

330
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,000
[in English] And don't let anybody
tell you that they weren't afraid.

331
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,125
- That's a lot of bullshit. You know?
- Yeah.

332
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,458
Everybody's afraid.
And you pray a lot.

333
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,583
I prayed a lot.

334
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,208
I prayed that I'd never sin again
as long as I live

335
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,875
if I could just get out of here.

336
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,041
But then the fighting starts
and then you forget about everything.

337
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,333
You're just trying to survive,
stay alive.

338
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,375
Once I saw
that I was getting through the war,

339
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,416
I looked around me, I said...

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,583
I said, "From now on,
whatever happens, happens."

341
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,833
<i>Che successe successe.</i>
Fuck it.

342
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,500
You know, you got orders, you follow them.

343
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,458
They tell you to bring some prisoners
into... into the woods,

344
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,625
you know,

If you got it,

859
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,458
a truck brought it to you.

860

[crowd applauding]

861
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,125
If you got your food, your clothing,

862
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:41,375
your medicine,
if you got fuel for your homes,

863
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,291
fuel for your industries,

864
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,041

[all cheering and applauding]

866
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:51,250
The day our trucks stop,

867
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,958
America stops!

868
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,458

<i>Well, there's a situation</i>

870
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,083
<i>going on now, Frank,
that needs to be attended to.</i>

871
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,250
You know,
they're trying to tear the union apart.

872
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:06,375
Big business and the government
working together, trying to pull us down.

873

[over microphone] <i>Big business</i>

00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,041
and they're coming fast!

876
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:16,458
Big business and the government
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

877
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,250
among our ranks,

878
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,750
at a time when we need unity!

879
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:24,000
We need solidarity!

880
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:26,458

- I want to write it in the sky.

881
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:28,458

I'm available.

Yes, I can, sir.

- He likes to talk, don't he?
- Yeah.

893
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,458

and nobody knows
what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

900
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,125
- Yeah.
- You and I know why you're here.

901
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,958
We gotta be able to sign these drivers up

902
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,166
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em
for his fucking union.

903
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,583
For some reason, lesbians.

904
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,583
Most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians.

905
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,625
I have no reason why.

906
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,416
Paul Hall's running around saying
that he's gonna get a better contract

907
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,291
than our boy fucking Jimmy.

908
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,541
He's a cocksucker. Yeah.

909
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:49,625
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley
in his pocket.

910
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:52,166
The cops are okay
with whatever the fuck we do.

911
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,500
They're not gonna help us
push these cars in,

912
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,458
but they certainly are not gonna
let anybody fucking stop us.

913
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,416
Okay?

914
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,500

[men grunting]

916

[Joey] Come on! All of you guys.
Come on!

917
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,333
Let's get this fucking thing in there.
Watch yourself!

918
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,833
This is a lot of work.

919
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,291
Yeah, you ever think of using candy?

920
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,083
- What?
- Candy.

921
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,125
What the fuck is candy?

922
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,958
[Joey] Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.

923
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,708
[Lou] I got it. I got it.

924
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,833
[Joey] Here, you take the gas.

925
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,416
[Joey] Frank, there's one thing
about Jimmy.

926
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,250
Don't ever make him wait.

927
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,833
If you make a meeting with him,
you get there on time.

928
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,208
Better yet, get there early.

929
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,833
I can't stress this enough.

930
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:13,208
His problem is that time is of essence.

931
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:15,125
And that's the important thing.

932
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,541
I gotta tell you one more thing.
Jimmy doesn't drink.

933
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,583
Yeah. The head of the largest
trucking union in the world,

934
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:21,500
he don't drink.

935
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,958
The worst part about it is,

936
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,166
he doesn't allow anybody
to drink around him.

937
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,875
[laughing]

938
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,750
[scoffs]

939
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,833
Another thing about him,

940
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,500
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

941
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:35,791
[laughing]

942
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,083
But we're gonna like watermelon.

943
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,791
Jimmy, you shoulda seen it,

944
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,250
sinking in the water.
[imitates bubbling]

945
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,708
One by one.
I bet you, when they woke up

946
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:49,333
the next morning,
those fucking cab drivers,

947
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:50,833
they went to look for their cabs,

948
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,333
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

949
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,458
[laughing]

950
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,958
That's a great idea, Joey.

951
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,250
Great idea.

952
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,291
Well, it wasn't my idea.

953
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,416
My man Frank. It was his idea. [laughs]

954
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,000
Let me tell you something.

955
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,875
Frank hit that pier,
he took over the pier.

956
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,041
Whatever he told them to do,
whatever he said,

957
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,291
they did it, you know.

958
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:14,041
I never seen a guy walk
through a crowd like he does.

959
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,375
He doesn't touch a fucking person!

960
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,791
Everybody gets out of the way.

961
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,666
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

962
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,083
Guys he never met in his life.
You know, it was like...

963
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,000
like Moses. Remember Moses?

964
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,125
When he walked into the ocean,
the sea,

965
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,250
whatever the fuck it was,
and it opened up!

966
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,416
That's him. I'm telling you.
Jimmy, he's got it.

967
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,666
So, uh, what do you think?

968
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,541
You need him
a couple of days more?

969
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,250
Yeah, we gotta clear up
a few dribs and drabs.

970
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,875
[munching]

971
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,583
You guys sure like watermelon.

972
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:42,166
Want a bite?

973
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,708
- Not on your life.
- [both laughing]

974
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,708
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

975
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,708
Those guys ain't union.

976
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,791
They're like Nazi collaborators,
operating behind the lines.

977
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,500
- You know. You were in the war.
- I sure do.

978
00:52:56,958 --> 00:53:01,916
In a war,
you go from point A to point B.

979
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,291
Sometimes,

980
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:07,250
you spill a little beer along the way.

981
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,000
That philosophy make sense to you?

982
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,125
Sure does.

983
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,291
Good.

984
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:22,750
[light switch clicks]

985
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,250
[Frank] <i>Jimmy, he didn't make me</i>
<i>stay in his suite</i>

986
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,750
<i>because he liked me.</i>

987
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,416

Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

991
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,666

<i>or Skinny or even me.</i>

1008
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:33,083
Sorry, everybody.
This is just for Peggy and I.

1009
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,208
[Frank] <i>For one thing,</i>
<i>Jimmy didn't have a nickname</i>

1010

<i>like "The Razor," or "The Hunchback,"</i>

1011

- Thank you!
- Oh!

<i>He was helping them

1016
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,875
<i>He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.</i>

"'If you have it,
a truck brought it to you."

1018
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:57,583
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

1019
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,125
He's the president of the Teamsters Union

1020
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,250
with over a million members.

1021
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:05,208
They all support him
because they have steady jobs,

1022
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:07,958
great pay and a pension
for when they retire.

1023

[Frank] <i>The Teamster Pension Fund</i>

1024

<i>And Jimmy had complete control
over every bit of it.</i>

1026

[Jake] Isn't this
a beautiful presentation?

1027
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,000
I mean, a bridge loan is really
all I'm asking, Jimmy.

1028

I'm not gonna piss away
my members' pension dough

This is not a risk, Jimmy.

1031
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,833
I got Minsky's Follies.

1032
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:33,291
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

1033
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,791
I'm telling you, we're booming in there.

1034
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:35,958
I can't get the drinks out...

1035
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,666
Just asking for a golf course.

1036
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,083
You know you never lost a dime with me.

1037
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:41,125
Jimmy, we'd really just appreciate

1038
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,833
whatever you could do
to help Jake along here.

1039
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:45,416
One-five is all I need
for a completion bond.

1040
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,625
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

1041
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:51,833
[Jake] Thank you.

1042
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:52,958
It's gonna be a big success.

1043
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,000
Thank you, Jimmy. You're a prince.

1044
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,083
- You're a <i>mensch.</i>
- [Jimmy] Yeah, I'm a <i>mensch.</i>

1045
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,666
[Peggy] <i>And, because of Mr. Hoffa,</i>

1046
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,750
workers have medical insurance
for when they get sick,

1047
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:14,750
and know when they retire,
they're not going to go hungry.

1048
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,000
[Frank] <i>There was</i>
<i>so much paperwork back then</i>

1049
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,916
<i>that Jimmy had to use
an insurance company</i>

1050
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,666
<i>that was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman,
to work out the loans.</i>

1051
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,166
No, no, nothing for nothing.

1052
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,375
Next time,
try asking a little bit fucking nicer.

1053
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,750
And? And? How'd it go?

1054
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,416
It was a little touch and go
for a little bit.

1055
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,041
- But at the end, fine.
- Good.

1056
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,375
[Frank] <i>It was Russ who got Jimmy</i>

1057
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,208
<i>to give guys like Gottlieb the loans,</i>

1058
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,958
<i>and, you know,
he would get like 10% of that.</i>

1059
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,500
<i>Or whatever, you know. Maybe more.</i>

1060
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:50,916
Listen, you tell Marteduzzo
from me that I appreciate it.

1061
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
And everybody's gonna appreciate it.

1062
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:53,458
It's a good thing.

1063
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,500
Okay. I'll do that.

1064
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:56,541
[Frank] <i>Back then,</i>
<i>you couldn't go to regular banks</i>

1065
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,291
<i>because the money was for gambling.</i>

1066
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,958
<i>God's truth, that's what it was.
I'm serious. You couldn't.</i>

1067
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,833
<i>So the Mob, what did they do?</i>

1068
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,708
<i>They went to the Teamsters
for the money.</i>

1069
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,583
<i>It was the Teamsters that stepped in</i>

1070
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,541
<i>and lent the money that built Las Vegas.</i>

1071
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,375
- This is the mahogany...
- Don't, Billy.

1072
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:11,708
- Don't touch the stuff.
- I won't.

1073
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,250
- Just go where you gotta go.
- Okay.

1074
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,916
[Frank] <i>There was more business</i>
<i>than anybody could handle.</i>

1075
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,291
<i>So Jimmy had to shove
some of the deals</i>

1076
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,916
<i>off on to his wife Jo,</i>

1077
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,166
<i>who had no idea she had 22%</i>

1078
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,916
<i>of a Florida land deal
called "Sun Valley,"</i>

1079
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,625
<i>some charter fishing boats,</i>

1080
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,916
<i>and a ski lodge with its own mountain.</i>

1081
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:37,583
<i>One of Jimmy's clients
was Sam "Momo" Giancana,</i>

1082
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,208
<i>who was friends with the Kennedys
from back when Jack's father</i>

1083
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,166
<i>made his fortune with the Italians</i>

1084
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,333
<i>as a bootlegger during Prohibition.</i>

1085
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:48,083
<i>Momo, Sinatra hung out together
with the Kennedys.</i>

1086
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,208
Momo and Kennedy,

1087
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,625
believe it or not,
even had the same girlfriend.

1088
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,750
Together. At the same time.

1089
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,416
Talk about crazy.

1090
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,458
<i>So it was easy for the Mob
to help Joe Kennedy</i>

1091
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:03,041
<i>get his son elected president.
That was easy.</i>

1092
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,500
<i>They just punched up the vote a little</i>

1093
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,041
<i>to make sure that he won in Illinois.</i>

1094
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,291
<i>In exchange for that,</i>

1095
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,666
the new president was supposedly
gonna get Castro out of Cuba

1096
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,333
so our guys could get their casinos back,

1097
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,416
and race tracks, and shrimp boats,

1098
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,833
and everything else that they had,

1099
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,291
and owned down there from Havana back.

1100
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,291
But that... that didn't happen.

1101
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,333
<i>The Italians wanted Kennedy
the Irishman for president,</i>

1102
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,375
<i>and that's what they got.</i>

1103
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,250
[Jimmy] Get used to it,
because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

1104
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:46,875
Son of a bitch!

1105
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,000
Goddamn Kennedys.

1106
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,458
I'm looking at the goddamn Kennedys.

1107
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,500
Jimmy, the kids. Language.

1108
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,458
Oh, what difference does it make?

1109
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:55,125
I mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.

1110
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:56,958
We're going to war with these people.

1111
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,166
War!

1112
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,958
If I said it once,
I said it a thousand times,

1113
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,791
I don't care they're Irish.

1114
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't care they're Catholic.

1115
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,458
If there's one person
you can't trust in this life,

1116
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:10,041
it's millionaires' kids.

1117
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,916
- You're right, Jimmy.
- [Jimmy grumbles]

1118
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,625
Especially that little son of a bitch.

1119
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,375
Are you saying you don't remember

1120
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,458
doing any favors for Johnny Dio,

1121
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,416
or you don't remember
the conversation?

1122
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:26,875
I'm saying,
to the best of my recollection,

1123
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,875
I must recall on my memory,

1124
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,833
I cannot remember.

1125
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,958
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

1126
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:40,000
Individuals.

1127
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,833
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

1128
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,708
Uh...

1129
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:50,166
Off hand, that particular amount of money
I borrowed,

1130
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,750
I don't know at this particular moment.

1131
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:58,500
But the record of my loans,
which I requested, I have,

1132
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,875
and out of all the moneys I loaned

1133
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:04,833
during this period of time
I went into these ventures.

1134
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,375
<i>Those goddamn Kennedys,</i>

1135
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,875
they get what they want!

1136
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,000
Jimmy. Jimmy, the kids.

1137
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,833
Him and all the bullshit problems

1138
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:18,708
- he put me through already.
- Jimmy.

1139
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,916
[Jimmy] I gotta go.
You don't expect me to look at this.

1140
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,375
No, I don't.

1141
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,791
- Whoa!
- [Frank] <i>For guys like Russ,</i>

1142
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,291
<i>it couldn't have been better.</i>

1143
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,458
<i>I mean, Russ,</i>

1144
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,958
<i>oh, yeah, he did his part
for getting Kennedy elected,</i>

1145
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:31,958
<i>that's for sure.</i>

1146
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,458
What are you doing?
I told you to put it...

1147
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:35,000
I told you to put them on every pole.

1148
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:35,958
You're still walking around.

1149
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:37,250
[Frank] <i>So what's the first thing</i>

1150
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,250
<i>that Jack Kennedy does
to thank Chicago for all their help?</i>

1151
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:43,500
He puts his shitass brother in there,

1152
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,833
<i>that little prep school punk,</i>

1153
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:47,333
<i>and he winds up making him
attorney general.</i>

1154
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,125
[gasps] Oh!

1155
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,083
And what's the first thing Bobby does?

1156
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:54,041
He goes after not just Jimmy,

1157
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,708
which in a way you could understand.

1158
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,625
I mean, Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much

1159
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:01,458
he gave Nixon $500,000 in Teamster cash.

1160
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,250
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,

1161
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:07,625
Marcello, Trafficante,
and all the other guys

1162
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,666
who put his brother in the White House
in the first place.

1163
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,125
What's that about?

1164
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,291
Frank.

1165
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,041
- Oh, thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1166
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:18,250
Am I missing something?

1167
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,291
[Frank] Thank you, Carrie.

1168
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,375
- [Carrie] That's gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

1169
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,958
Wear it in the best of health.
We love you.

1170
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,083
Okay, now this one is for Peggy

1171
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:35,916
from Uncle Russell.
Merry Christmas, my love.

1172
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,458
Oh, look at those.

1173
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:39,583
[Carrie gasps]

1174
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,041
So nice!

1175
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,833
I heard you like to skate.

1176
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:46,666
What do you say?

1177
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,541
Thank you.

1178
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,083
[Carrie] Now me and Uncle Russell
could take you ice skating.

1179
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:56,000
I think Santa Claus left you
a little something extra in there too.

1180
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,583
[women exclaiming]

1181
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,791
[Frank] What do you say
to Uncle Russell?

1182
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,083
What do you say?

1183
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,333
Huh?

1184
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,875
Frank, it's all right.

1185
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,041
She said thank you once.
That's enough.

1186
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,958
[Frank] <i>With Bobby as attorney general,</i>
<i>I mean, they were all over us.</i>

1187
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,125
<i>I mean, we couldn't talk on the phone</i>

1188
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,083
<i>because we knew it was being bugged.</i>

1189
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:24,916
<i>You couldn't do nothing.
You couldn't go nowhere.</i>

1190
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,250
<i>You couldn't do anything.</i>

1191
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:28,625
<i>It was a bad, bad, bad situation.</i>

1192
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,750
<i>And then Jimmy... Forget it.</i>

1193
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,416
<i>Bobby, now as attorney general,
he has the power</i>

1194
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,583
<i>to send anybody to jail,
and no question about it.</i>

1195
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:38,125
<i>And Jimmy was at the top
of Bobby's hit list.</i>

1196
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,875
<i>He even set up
a special "Get Hoffa Squad,"</i>

1197

<i>where he had his own guys from the FBI,</i>

1198
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,625
<i>the IRS working 'round the clock.</i>

1199
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:47,791
<i>Their only job
was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.</i>

1200
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:49,083
<i>I'm serious. That's all they did.</i>

1201
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,041
[Jimmy] I am sitting in a room
full of fuckin' idiots.

1202
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,125
You dumb motherfuckers!

1203
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,833
You know what you did?

1204
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:04,333
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

1205
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,583
and you put him on

1206
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,875
as general organizer,

1207
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,375
pay him 36 fucking grand,

1208
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,458
at the same time,

1209
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,500
you let him sell insurance
to his fucking father's...

1210
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,375
to his fucking father's...

1211
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:34,916
to his fucking father's locals!

1212
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Damn it!

1213
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,375
How do you do that?

1214
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,833
How stupid can you be?

1215
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,000
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

1216
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:51,541
has got his nose up my ass
everywhere I go!

1217
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,500
You don't know
that they're hounding me?

1218
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,000
They're looking at everything I do.

1219
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:57,458
And you let this happen in public!

1220
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,833
You're giving it to him!

1221
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,916
I'm going to jail. You understand?

1222
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,958
I'm going to prison because of you,

1223
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,291
you dumb motherfuckers.

1224
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,750
This is what you wanted.
You wanted to put me in jail.

1225
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,708
Tell me now so I can kill you right here.

1226
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,750
Right here!

1227
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:19,458
Where're you going?

1228
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:20,458
What do you mean,
where am I going?

1229
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,041
I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

1230
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,208
What are you quitting for?

1231
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,375
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

1232
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,375
You can talk to them like that,
you can't talk to me like that.

1233
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,583
Frank. No! That didn't apply to you.
What are you...

1234
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,666
- Didn't apply?
- No!

1235
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,208
Then you gotta let me know
it didn't apply to me.

1236
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:35,041
- I'm standing right there.
- I didn't even see you standing there!

1237
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,625
I was standing right there, Jimmy.

1238
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:37,875
What are you talking about?

1239
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,125
But it didn't apply to you!
What else can I say?

1240
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,500
[sputtering]

1241
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,416
You got a problem, you pull me aside.

1242
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,708
You don't insult me
and then you say it didn't apply to me.

1243
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:48,958
How am I gonna put you aside?
I didn't even see you there.

1244
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,958
Oh, come on, Frank,
you know me better than that.

1245
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,875
You just know me better than that.

1246
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:55,166
Please.

1247
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,375
Come on. It's gonna be all right.

1248
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,333
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

1249
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,375
Come on, why would I ever
say anything like that to you?

1250
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:02,625
[Frank] You gotta control these people.

1251
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,291
I'm controlling everything.
Don't worry about it.

1252
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,958
But certainly, certainly, I... you know.

1253
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,916
Come on. Okay, guys, get out of here now.

1254
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:13,625
[Frank sputters] <i>I mean, I don't know how</i>
<i>Jimmy is running the fucking union.</i>

1255
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:16,208
Between Bobby and the FBI
up his ass all the time,

1256
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,875
he's going fucking crazy.

1257
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:21,291
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

1258
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,791
The old-timers know the Old Man.
They'll talk to him.

1259
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,958
At some point,
they'll straighten it out for him.

1260
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,333
Yeah, but he can't understand,

1261
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,666
and I gotta be honest with you,
I don't understand either,

1262
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,791
how youse could help get
those two fucking Kennedy pricks

1263
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,041
elected in the first place.

1264
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,916
It don't make no sense to him,
that's for sure.

1265
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,125
He doesn't have to understand everything.

1266
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,458
You know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes it's better.

1267
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,791
Well...

1268
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:43,125
When I see him like that,
I don't, you know,

1269
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,750
I... I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.

1270
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,958
I wanna help him in some way.

1271
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:49,083
- [stammers]
- Listen, he's too emotional.

1272
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,250
Like some guy who's always
rushing, rushing

1273
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:54,208
all over the place
and they miss the big picture.

1274
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,250
Like Cuba.

1275
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:01,041
Getting us back into casinos.

1276
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,500
Getting us back into Havana.

1277
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:06,583
Like getting rid
of that fucking Castro prick.

1278
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,541
The old-timers spoke to the Old Man.

1279
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:15,958
The Old Man talked to his son Jack,
and he told him,

1280
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:18,625
"Don't forget who the fuck he owes."

1281
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:23,250
He knows who the fuck he owes.

1282
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,625
<i>So I want you</i>

1283
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:30,208
<i>to go down to a place
called Milestone Hauling.</i>

1284
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:33,875
<i>There's a guy named Phil.</i>

1285
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,833
<i>He's gonna give you a rig.</i>

1286
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,250
[engine starting]

1287
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,583
<i>You drive the rig down to Baltimore</i>

1288
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,375
<i>to a concrete plant.</i>

1289
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:48,791
<i>It's on Eastern Avenue.</i>

1290
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:51,458
<i>It's the only one on the street.
You can't miss it.</i>

1291
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,458
<i>A guy's gonna meet you there.</i>

1292
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:59,750
<i>A fairy named Ferrie.</i>

1293
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,166
Just pull it forward and then back it in.

1294
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,791
[men shout indistinctly]

1295
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,625

[Russell] <i>You'll pick up some things.</i>

1299
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,916
<i>He'll give you some paperwork
in case you get stopped.</i>

1300
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,416
<i>You drive the truck down to Florida.</i>

1301
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,500
<i>A dog track outside Jacksonville.</i>

1302
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:48,625
<i>You leave it there.</i>

1303
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:53,791
<i>A guy with big ears named Hunt
will meet you there.</i>

1304
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,250
<i>He's gonna give you a car
to drive back to Philly.</i>

1305
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,291
What are you looking at?

1306
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,833
You looking at my ears?

1307
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,541
Sorry?

1308
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:19,041
My ears.

1309
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,082
- Are you looking at my ears?
- Your ears?

1310
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,041
No.

1311
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,082
I had an operation,
so there's no need for anyone

1312
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,625
looking at my ears anymore.

1313
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:30,916
Yeah, well, I ain't looking at your ears.

1314
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,832
Right.

1315
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,916
[keys jingling]

1316
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,207
Get out of here. Go on.

<i>Paratroopers were unable</i>

<i>Castro raced toward the scene.</i>

<i>The underground might have blown up
the roads but it knew nothing.</i>

1327

1337

01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,832
Just as I predicted. They fuck up Cuba,

01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,082
Boobie starts coming after me
and the union.

1345
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,916
He's looking for some cheap publicity.

1346
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,875
That's all it is.
That's what he's doing.

1347
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,375
Okay.
Well, it's all gonna blow over, Jimmy.

1348

No, it's not gonna blow over.
How's it gonna blow over?

1349
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,875
They're never gonna forget

1350

- that I gave money to Nixon!
- Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1351

We're gonna handle this.

1352
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,416
Couple of the old-timers,
they're gonna get to Old Man Kennedy now.

1353
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,125
Okay? They're gonna get to him.
He's a little sick, but...

1354
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,375
- Sick?
- Yeah. But...

1355
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:17,208
He had a fucking stroke.
That's not sick.

1356
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,666
That's you're...
you're close to the grave, is what.

1357
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,708
He's turning into a fucking eggplant.

1358
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,000
Okay. Well, you can't blame
anybody for that. That's...

1359
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,333
I'm not looking to blame anybody.

1360
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:27,750
But if there's any blame going around,
it's the Kennedys.

1361
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,833
His kids killed him. Let me tell you that.

1362
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:32,458
He's not dead, but he's going.
He's going.

01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,708
You're like family to me, Frank.
You know.

1534
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:55,083
You, Irene,

1535
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:56,791
the girls.

1536
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:57,875
The lovely Peggy.

1537
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,000
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1538
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:03,583
I'm not giving you anything
you didn't earn,

1539
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:05,583
you didn't deserve.

1540
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:07,958
What do you think?

1541
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,083
Um, I... I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1542
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,333
- I mean, um...
- Well, just say you'll do it.

1543
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,750
That's all you got to say.

1544
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,166
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

1545
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,250
[chuckles]

1546
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,166
Ha! When you run for president

1547
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,708
of 326, you're gonna win.

1548
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,333
I guarantee it.

1549
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:32,291
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

1550
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,041
You mean it, huh?

1551
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,333
Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

1552
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:40,166
I love you. I just love you, you know.
Come here.

1553
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,833
I love you, man.

1554
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:43,458
I can't tell ya.

1555
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:44,416
Oh, gee.

1556
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,125
Oh, this is so good, you know.

1557
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,416
I feel like I can breathe again.
[chuckles]

1558
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,041
It's so funny. I...

1559
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,208
Somehow I...

1560
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,666
I don't know.
I thought you would've said no.

1561
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,250
- Oh, um...
- I'm glad you said yes.

1562
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,208
I mean...

1563
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:01,625
Frank...

1564
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:06,625
You never reveal how you feel, you know.
It's hard to tell.

1565
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,833
I'm honored, Jimmy. I don't know...

1566
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,916
It's just I don't know what to... say,

1567
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,250
you know, but I'm honored.

1568
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,791
Well, that's good.

1569
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,125
That makes me feel good.

1570
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,958
Oh, I can breathe.

1571
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,416
That's so great.

1572
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:26,208
I...

1573
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:53,083
[blues music playing]

1574
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:57,625
[Frank] <i>What can I say?</i>
<i>I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.</i>

1575
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:01,041
<i>He took me out of a meat truck,
he gave me my start.</i>

1576
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:04,750
<i>He gave me my first charter.
He gave me my first union.</i>

1577
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:07,375
- How are ya?
- Hey, how are you?

1578
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:09,750
Frank Sheeran,
the new president of Union 326.

1579
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:12,291
- I wanted to introduce myself.
- Nice to meet ya.

1580
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,541
- What's your name?
- My name's Al.

1581
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:16,375
Al. Nice to meet ya, Al.

1582
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,333
- A little something...
- No, no. Don't need it.

1583
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,250
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1584
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,791
Just came here to say hello,
introduce myself.

1585
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,666
You need anything,
just get in touch with me.

1586
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,750
- Okay? Yeah.
- You sure?

1587
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:25,791
Thank you.

1588
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:28,041
[Frank] So, hypothetically,
if they can prove

1589
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,041
that you stole from them,

1590
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,833
what they're gonna want are names, so...

1591
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:36,833
Would you be willing to give up names
to keep from going to jail?

1592
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,291
No.

1593
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:41,041
Okay. So you got nothing to worry about.

1594
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:44,500
- The lawyers will take care of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Sheeran.

1595
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:57,708
[Frank] <i>The Interstate 80 West</i>
<i>through the rest of Pennsylvania,</i>

1596
01:21:58,208 --> 01:22:02,500
<i>and then we'd go across Ohio
all the way to Toledo,</i>

1597
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:06,125
<i>and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.</i>

1598
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:09,250
<i>And we'd still get there on time.</i>

1599
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,458
[Bill] <i>Your Honor,</i>
<i>my client had been advised by counsel</i>

1600
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:16,791
that it was perfectly legal for his wife

1601
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:19,041
to be part owner of a trucking business.

1602
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:22,291
Still, when the McClellan Committee
challenged its legality,

1603
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,666
she withdrew from the company
immediately.

1604
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,916
That should be the end of the matter.

1605
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,708
There had been not one indictment served

1606
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:33,041
against my client
in 13 grand jury investigations.

1607
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:36,750
Your Honor, this is an example of

1608
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:39,041
a personal vendetta against my client,

1609
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,708
against his family,
by a frustrated Justice Department

1610
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,833
and the attorney general, Robert Kennedy.

1611
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,750
- [men exclaiming]
- [gun clicking]

1612
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,166
- [man] Whoa!
- [Jimmy grunts]

1613
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,083
[man 2] He's got a gun!

1614
01:22:53,791 --> 01:22:54,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,375
[all clamoring]

1616
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,333
Get that gun out of his hand!

1617
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,083
[clamoring continues]

1618
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:04,208
Easy, boy.

1619
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,625
That was not a real gun, was it?

1620
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:13,166
How'd that gun get in?

1621
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,375
How'd it get in here?

1622
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,041
It wasn't my fault!

1623
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,333
I don't know!

1624
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:18,500
[Jimmy] Oh, my Chuckie!

1625
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,791
Hey, it's my son!

1626
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,083
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1627
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,916
You see him? You see what he did?

1628
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,333
[all applauding]

1629
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,625
I'll tell you this.

1630
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:31,791
He shot at me,
and it was like a pellet or something.

1631
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,958
I didn't feel it,
I just felt a little impact,

1632
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,291
like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

1633
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:38,125
Something even lighter.

1634
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,375
But I charged him.

1635
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:41,083
I charged him and so did Chuckie,
if you noticed.

1636
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:42,083
I taught him well.

1637
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:46,166
You charge a guy,
always charge a guy with a gun.

1638
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,625
With a knife, you run away.

1639
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:51,083
Run away from a knife.
So you charge with a gun,

1640
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,750
- with a knife, you run.
- [man] That's right.

1641
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,875
- [all cheering]
- Hey! I rhymed!

1642
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:56,583
[camera flash popping]

1643
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:59,000
I know it sounds crazy,
but I got a message from a higher power

1644
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,208
telling me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.

1645
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,166
Come with me.

1646
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,333
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

1647
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:05,291
Come on down, Frank.

1648
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,208
Yeah, I got one of them
with me now, you see.

1649
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,541
<i>Get down here, Frank.</i>

1650
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,541
<i>Eddie Partin, you know the guy
from Baton Rouge,</i>

1651
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,541
<i>he's here with me.</i>

1652
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:12,791
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right down.

1653
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,625
Out of my way, boys. Come on.

1654
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,041
[indistinct chatter]

1655
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,333
Come on, come on.

1656
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,375
[indistinct chatter]

1657
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,250
Hey.

1658
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:24,000
[prosecutor] Did Mr. Brennan first say,

1659
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:25,583
or do you remember him first saying

1660
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:28,625
something about, say,
"I had to change the deal.

1661
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,833
I have to cut Hoffa in on the new deal"?

1662
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:33,833
Wasn't that like the chronology
of the whole thing?

1663
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:36,250
[man] I don't know he changed the deal,

1664
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:39,541
but it was my understanding
over the telephone that Brennan

1665
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:41,083
was speaking for himself.

1666
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,833
[Bill] <i>She's an angry woman.</i>
<i>That's an angry woman.</i>

1667
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:43,958
- [King] Oh.
- [Bill] Yeah.

1668
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:46,291
- [investigator] She was a teacher I think.
- [Bill] Oh, that's right.

1669
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:48,000
[investigator] What we're looking at
is this one.

1670
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,375
This one is not approachable.

1671
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:50,958
[Bill] No, she'd be
a tough nut to crack.

1672
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,458
[King] There's a lot
of family money there.

[investigator] Yeah.
I'd rather stick with the women.

- [man 3] Who's this guy?

1865
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:41,583

1866

[men groaning]

1867
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,583
Mr. Provenzano.
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.

1868
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:48,333
I have a warrant for your arrest.
Please stand.

1869
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,291
- Can I finish my hand?
- No, sir. Please stand.

1870
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,541
[Tony Pro] I had
a bad fucking hand anyway.

1871
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:53,875
[man 1] Middle of the game.

1872
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,083
[man 2] Join the club. Deal him in.

1873
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:57,166
[FBI agent] Other arm, please.

1874
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,000
- [Tony Pro] Can I get my bags?
- [FBI agent] No, sir.

1875
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:01,500
I got nothing in my pocket.
I got fucking shorts on here.

1876
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:03,458
Look at this penguin over there, huh?

1877
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:05,583
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

1878
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:06,875
Yeah, I'll get your bags, Tony.

1879
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,750
[man] This is like watchin' TV.

[Frank] <i>They got Pro for extortion</i>

1882

1883
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:17,708

1884

<i>Jimmy.</i>

1885

Oh.

1886
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,041
Look at that.

1887
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,791
A work of art.

1888
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:33,791
Thank you, Pete.

1889
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,000
[footsteps approaching]

1890
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:44,750
I gotta talk to you about a problem
I got with my pension.

1891
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I know.

1892
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:50,708
Oh, you know?

1893
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:52,958
What do you know?

1894
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,833
I know

1895
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,625
you got a million two

1896
01:35:57,708 --> 01:36:00,166
and, uh, there's a problem with it.

1897
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:04,083
So you'll look into it for me?

1898
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,916
How am I going to look into it?
What am I gonna look into?

1899
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09,250
It is what it is.

1900
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:11,000
Well, what is it?

1901
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:12,791
You lost it.

1902
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:16,750
You forfeited it when you came in here.
That's it.

1903
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:20,333
So is yours forfeited too?

1904
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:21,375
No.

1905
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:27,125
Let me get this straight.
So yours is still there,

1906
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,291
your million five, whatever it is,

1907
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:30,750
but mine's gone?

1908
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,958
Yeah. Mine's still there.

1909
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,458
But we're both sitting here.

1910
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:40,916
We're both sitting here. That's right.

1911
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,375
Only we're sitting here
for different things.

1912
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:46,458
You're sitting here for extortion.

1913
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:48,833
I'm sitting here for fraud.

1914
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:52,458
- So?
- So? So there's a difference.

1915
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:53,666
What's the difference?

1916
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:59,500
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

1917
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:01,333
So what? That makes no sense.

1918
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:02,625
What do you mean? It does.

1919
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,500
No, it doesn't. I don't want a debate.

1920
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:07,000
- Think about it.
- I'm thinking about it, Jimmy.

1921
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,416
No, don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

1922
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:09,958
Just do something about it.

1923
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:16,791
What do you mean,
"do something about it"?

1924
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:17,791
What am I gonna do?

1925
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,541
Come on,
there's always something you can do.

1926
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,833
No. It's federal law.

1927
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,583
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

1928
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:24,541
No, you can still do something about it.

1929
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:26,458
There's nothing I can do.
What can I do?

1930
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,166
You can get my fucking money.

1931
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,166
How?

1932
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,541
- Some other way.
- What way?

1933
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,000
The same way you got your money.

1934
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:34,125
Shh. Lower your fucking voice.

1935
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,625
You telling me to lower my voice?

1936
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:37,750
I'm tellin' you to lower
your fucking voice.

1937
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:39,000
Cocksucker.

1938
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,458
- Don't call me a cocksucker.
- Fuck you.

1939
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:42,041
Don't you fucking dare.

1940
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:45,083
Look, you're here for fraud.

1941
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,750
- You stole money.
- I stole money?

1942
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:47,833
Yeah, I stole money.

1943
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:49,541
Okay, fine, in a different way, but still,

1944
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:52,125
I want what I'm fucking owed.

1945
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:55,333
You people. You people.

1946
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:56,583
- What did you say?
- Oh, my God!

1947
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:57,500
What did you say?

1948
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,000
Oh, come on, what I said.

1949
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,500
What the fuck did I say?

1950
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,791
"You people." You said "You people."

1951
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:03,708
What does that fucking mean,
"You people"?

1952
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,125
I'm done

1953
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,916
talking about this.

1954
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,208
- "You people"?
- I'm done!

1955
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,083
You're done?
I'll rip your fucking head off!

I can't believe it.
That is not right, Frankie.

Yeah.

Just didn't give a shit.

1996

he kidnapped his own bosses.

I don't know how he got away with that.

1998

You don't get away with that.
You do that, you die.

That simple.

When he went away to the can,

2001
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:33,958
he recruited black guys
instead of his own kind.

2002
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:36,041
And when he got out,
nobody knew what he was doing,

2003
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,125
or who he was doing with it.

2004

We didn't know what the hell
was going on. Nobody did.

01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,333

- Oh, no, no.

Now, listen.

Okay? You can't do that.

01:50:27,625 --> 01:50:28,625
What is that?

2196
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:33,041
[Frank] Tony has Fitz
in his pocket, Jimmy.

2197
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:34,666
Wise guys don't run the union.

2198
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:35,958
With Fitz, they do.

2199
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:39,583
Jimmy, listen,
as soon as you're back as president,

2200
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:40,625
you can do anything you want to.

2201
01:50:40,708 --> 01:50:42,541
You can fire anybody you want to.

2202
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:44,583
You can even fire Tony Pro.

2203
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:45,750
Whoa.

2204
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:48,666
You could stand over him,
watch him clear out his desk.

2205
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,708
- You could strip-search the guy.
- [chuckles]

2206
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,541
Make sure he doesn't walk off
with a paper clip.

2207
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:55,708
Ooh, yes. See that? Did you hear that?

2208
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,000
See, everybody thinks
Jo's the nice one

2209
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:00,791
- and I'm the bad guy.
- [Jo chuckles]

2210
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:02,125
But it's opposite.

2211
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:05,583
She's the killer and I'm the sweetheart.

2212
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:09,291
Now I gotta make peace
with the cocksucker.

2213
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:12,166
[mockingly] Oh, I want
to make up with you.

2214
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,541
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony.

2215
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:16,916
Please.

2216
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,250
[scoffs] Fucking...

2217
01:51:18,333 --> 01:51:20,708
[sputters] I'm not gonna get through this.

2218
01:51:20,791 --> 01:51:22,833
You gotta talk to him, that's all.
Just...

2219
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:24,666
- You gotta deal with it.
- [man on TV] <i>Let the chips fall</i>

2220
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:27,083
<i>- where they may.</i>
- Oh, he is a cocksucker, though.

2221
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:30,250
If I sat down with him,
would you come along?

2222
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,583
[Frank] What are you talking about?
Of course.

2223
01:51:31,666 --> 01:51:33,125
How am I not gonna go with you?

2224
01:51:42,875 --> 01:51:43,875
Fuck it. Let's go.

2225
01:51:43,958 --> 01:51:45,750
Ah, Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.

2226
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:47,666
Give it a chance.
Give it a few more minutes.

2227
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,250
- Just...
- This isn't right.

2228
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:53,125
This isn't right. You don't do this.

2229
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:55,166
You don't keep a man waiting.

2230
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,500
I know. I know.

2231
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,666
The only time you do

2232
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:01,875
is when you want to say something.

2233
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:03,416
I know.

2234
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,291
When you want to say "Fuck you."

2235
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:06,875
That's the only time.

2236
01:52:06,958 --> 01:52:08,916
- [men approaching]
- Here they are.

2237
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:13,333
Can you believe this weather, Frank? Huh?

2238
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:16,500
It's 85 degrees outside. Perfect.

2239
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:18,083
Hey, Tony Jack.

2240
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:19,000
[Tony Jack] Jimmy.

2241
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:22,416
People freezing to death
in New York and look at us, huh?

2242
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,416
Why we don't live here all year round
is what I wanna know.

2243
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,416
- [Jimmy] Oh.
- Beautiful.

2244
01:52:27,416 --> 01:52:29,500
- It's summer.
- What?

2245
01:52:30,291 --> 01:52:31,291
It's summer.

2246
01:52:32,416 --> 01:52:34,583
People aren't freezing to death
in New York.

2247
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,166
It's summer.

2248
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:41,458
In my mind,
it's always eight degrees in New York.

2249
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:42,666
I'm making a point.

2250
01:52:43,333 --> 01:52:44,541
You're making a point.

2251
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:46,875
Making a point dressing like that?

2252
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:48,666
Is that how you dress for a meeting?

2253
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:54,041
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?

2254
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:55,375
For a meeting?

2255
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:59,583
Anywhere.
Florida, Timbuktu, I dress in a suit.

2256
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:00,833
For a meetin'.

2257
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:03,291
- And you're late.
- What?

2258
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:05,375
You're late.

2259
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:08,791
Yeah, there was traffic.

2260
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:09,791
Yes, traffic.

2261
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:11,958
- [laughs]
- Wasn't there traffic?

2262
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,416
- You give me traffic?
- There was traffic.

2263
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,583
[stammers] What do you want from us?

2264
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:15,916
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

2265
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,875
Yeah, yeah. No, it's bad, you know?

2266
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:18,958
Traffic.

2267
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:22,833
I never waited for anyone who was late

2268
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:26,000
more than ten minutes in my life.

2269
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,333
I'd say fifteen. Fifteen's right.

2270
01:53:28,416 --> 01:53:29,541
No, ten.

2271
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:32,500
I don't think so, ten's not enough.

2272
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:34,375
You have to take traffic into account.

2273
01:53:34,458 --> 01:53:37,291
That's what I'm doing.
I'm taking traffic into account.

2274
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:39,083
That's why it's ten.

2275
01:53:39,166 --> 01:53:41,166
- I still say 15.
- No, ten.

2276
01:53:42,208 --> 01:53:44,250
Fine. We disagree on that.

2277
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,875
How about twelve and a half minutes?

2278
01:53:45,958 --> 01:53:47,250
- [Jimmy laughs]
- [Tony Pro] There we go, 12.5.

2279
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:49,458
The middle. Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

2280
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:51,125
More than ten...

2281
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:53,541
you're saying something.

2282
01:53:54,791 --> 01:53:56,708
- You saying something to me?
- I'm here.

2283
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:59,541
- Mmm.
- It says what it says.

2284
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:02,666
So there it is.

2285
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:05,333
Where do we go from here?

2286
01:54:08,125 --> 01:54:09,583
Well, what can I do for you?

2287
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,333
I want you...

2288
01:54:16,541 --> 01:54:17,708
I... [sighs]

2289
01:54:18,666 --> 01:54:20,250
I want you to endorse me...

2290
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,458
for you know what.

2291
01:54:24,541 --> 01:54:27,875
Before we get to that,
let's straighten that other thing up.

2292
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:30,125
No. The other thing
is none of my business.

2293
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:32,541
I can't do anything about your pension.

2294
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:36,166
I can't. Not with Fitz in there.
Fitz is in there, you know.

2295
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:37,416
- You go to Fitz.
- I did.

2296
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,750
- He'll help you out.
- I did.

2297
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:41,083
He said he'll take care of it,
no questions asked.

2298
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:43,083
You wouldn't do that but he will.

2299
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:45,291
I meant the other thing.

2300
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,166
What other thing?

2301
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,625
You know.

2302
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:51,083
I don't know.

2303
01:54:51,166 --> 01:54:52,458
Your apology.

2304
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,625
My apology?

2305
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:58,625
My apology for what?

2306
01:54:58,708 --> 01:55:00,375
For what you said
when you were sitting there

2307
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,666
eating your ice cream
like some fucking king.

2308
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,333
That was an ethnic slur. "You people."

2309
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:08,958
- Did you know what he said?
- Nah, I mean, I heard...

2310
01:55:09,041 --> 01:55:11,333
I heard you had an altercation
in the can, but I don't know.

2311
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:13,041
Yeah, "you people."

2312
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,250
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

2313
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:20,041
"You people." Am I beneath you?

2314
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:23,291
Definitely.

2315
01:55:23,375 --> 01:55:25,333
- Jimmy, come on.
- [Frank] Jimmy, what're you doing?

2316
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:27,458
Don't forget, "you people"
got you where you are.

2317
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,416
Oh, don't tell me that, you fucking...

2318
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:30,666
That's your problem, Jimmy.

2319
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:32,875
Your problem is you're a piece of shit.

2320
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:33,875
[chuckles] Jimmy, come on.

2321
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:35,833
- Jimmy, what are you doin'?
- Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

2322
01:55:35,916 --> 01:55:37,916
I asked for your endorsement
and you're giving me...

2323
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,041
I asked for your apology.

2324
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:41,500
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

2325
01:55:41,583 --> 01:55:42,875
[Frank softly] Jimmy...

2326
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:44,333
Who the fuck are you?

2327
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:45,416
[Tony Jack] Be gentle.

2328
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,250
- [Tony Pro] I don't need this.
- Let's just sit down. Tony.

2329
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:49,291
I need this? I need you?

2330
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:50,791
- Yeah, you need me.
- Oh, please.

2331
01:55:50,875 --> 01:55:52,333
Jimmy, come on.
You're asking him for something.

2332
01:55:52,416 --> 01:55:55,333
The guy gets me nervous.
He talks about things that get me upset.

2333
01:55:55,416 --> 01:55:56,583
Take it easy. Everybody's here.

2334
01:55:56,666 --> 01:55:59,208
Let's have the fucking meeting.
Come on.

2335
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:00,875
- [Frank] Let's talk.
- [Tony Jack] That's all.

2336
01:56:00,958 --> 01:56:02,083
He's here.

2337
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,583
Was this the altercation
youse had in the can?

2338
01:56:08,666 --> 01:56:09,625
Yeah, it was something like this.

2339
01:56:09,708 --> 01:56:11,375
We... We got to arm wrestling.

2340
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:13,416
He lost.

2341
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,458
[scoffs] I lost. You should see his ribs.

2342
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:16,500
[laughs]

2343
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:17,416
Why don't you just talk about

2344
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,916
- what you need to talk about.
- [all agreeing]

2345
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,250
What do you want me to do?

2346
01:56:22,208 --> 01:56:23,041
I said, "you people."

2347
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:25,000
What do you want me to do,
apologize for it?

2348
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:27,166
That's exactly what I want,
Jimmy. An apology.

2349
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:29,666
I'll apologize for it.

2350
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:30,875
That's all I want.

2351
01:56:32,541 --> 01:56:34,125
After you apologize

2352
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:36,000
for being late,

2353
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:39,041
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

2354
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:42,458
[laughs] Jimmy, are you
out of your fucking mind?

2355
01:56:42,541 --> 01:56:44,333
I'll apologize for being late

2356
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:46,791
after I kidnap your granddaughter,
rip her guts out,

2357
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:48,500
and send them to you
in a fucking envelope!

2358
01:56:48,583 --> 01:56:49,791
[all clamoring]

2359
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:54,833
[Tony Pro] Get him off! Come on!

2360
01:56:54,916 --> 01:56:55,833
I'll fucking kill him!

2361
01:56:55,916 --> 01:56:57,166
[Tony Jack] Come on, Tony! Jesus!

2362
01:56:58,083 --> 01:56:59,791
[both sighing]

2363
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:01,125
[mutters]

2364
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,708
You think Russ would...

2365
01:57:04,791 --> 01:57:06,541
would do something about this guy?

2366
01:57:07,458 --> 01:57:09,125
Ah, that's complicated.

2367
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,458
Yeah. It's complicated.

2368
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:13,875
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself,
you know,

2369
01:57:13,958 --> 01:57:16,250
- get the okay from them. But...
- I know.

2370
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,791
This guy's gotta go.

2371
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:19,541
- He's gotta go, Frank.
- Yeah.

2372
01:57:20,375 --> 01:57:22,208
I'm not gonna get the okay to do that.

2373
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:25,541
[Jimmy] Frank, just talk to the guy.

2374
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:27,708
Okay? Just talk to him.

2375
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:30,458
[blues music playing]

2376
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:37,541
[Fat Tony] <i>These guys from Jersey keep</i>

2377
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:40,000
<i>fucking calling me about this bullshit
between these two guys.</i>

2378
01:57:40,083 --> 01:57:42,500
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told them.

2379
01:57:43,333 --> 01:57:44,166
I don't approve

2380
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,833
- of what Pro said about Jimmy.
- No.

2381
01:57:45,916 --> 01:57:48,833
I mean, who talks like that
about a person's grandchildren?

2382
01:57:49,375 --> 01:57:51,166
- It's not fucking right.
- No.

2383
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,708
But Pro isn't nobody.

2384
01:57:58,916 --> 01:58:00,208
Jimmy should know that.

2385
01:58:00,291 --> 01:58:01,541
Hey, what am I gonna go?

2386
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:04,375
I'm not gonna tell this guy
what he can or can't fucking say,

2387
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:05,708
like he's a child.

2388
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:07,083
[Russell] Well, listen.

2389
01:58:07,166 --> 01:58:09,083
Jimmy don't mean nothing.
He just gets upset.

2390
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:11,000
Russ, come on,
we all know he's a fucking hothead.

2391
01:58:11,083 --> 01:58:12,416
We're all hotheads once in a while.

2392
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,750
Yeah, but Jimmy says things
he shouldn't say sometimes.

2393
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:16,375
[Russell] Yeah. We all do that too.

2394
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:18,333
Well, somebody should just calm him down.

2395
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:24,708
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna...

2396
01:58:24,791 --> 01:58:26,791
I'm gonna calm him down.
He's difficult, but...

2397
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:28,791
Maybe this could help him calm down.

2398
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:30,666
You could tell him
that I always liked him.

2399
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:32,666
Huh?

2400
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:35,750
And I won't stand in his way
of him trying to get his job back.

2401
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:36,958
I will. I will tell him that, Tony.

2402
01:58:37,041 --> 01:58:38,000
- Okay?
- Yes.

2403
01:58:38,083 --> 01:58:40,666
That's not making me calm down.

2404
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:42,000
Standing by me.

2405
01:58:42,541 --> 01:58:44,625
What the fuck does that mean?

2406
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:48,125
Standing by me ain't the same thing
as doing something

2407
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:51,708
about some out-of-control
fucking psycho!

2408
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:55,208
Jimmy, the Little Guy ain't a nobody.
You gotta understand that.

2409
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:56,958
- He ain't a nobody.
- He's a cocksucker.

2410
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:58,750
Fitz is a cocksucker.

2411
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:02,083
I'm gonna deal
with both these cocksuckers...

2412
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:03,291
myself!

2413
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:06,208
This used to be my office.

2414
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:09,375
Go look for Frank Fitzsimmons there.
You're not gonna find him.

2415
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:12,458
That's because he travels
all over the country

2416
01:59:12,541 --> 01:59:15,750
looking for goddamn golf courses
because that's what he does.

2417
01:59:15,833 --> 01:59:16,875
<i>He plays golf.</i>

2418
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:20,791
<i>Who is he to run around with Nixon,
run around with the attorney general?</i>

2419
01:59:20,875 --> 01:59:24,958
<i>He does this and collects full-time salary
while he's doing it.</i>

2420
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:26,291
<i>Now, how do you do that?</i>

2421
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:29,375
<i>There's not enough hours
in a day to do this job.</i>

2422
01:59:29,458 --> 01:59:31,625
<i>I was sent to prison for fraud.</i>

2423
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:34,041
<i>This is fraud, what he's doing.</i>

2424
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,291
[Frank] <i>So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?</i>

2425
01:59:38,375 --> 01:59:39,708
<i>He does it by sending a message</i>

2426
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:42,500
<i>to Jimmy's old friend, Dave Johnson.</i>

2427
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:45,833
<i>Now, Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.</i>

2428
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,041
<i>This was the message.</i>

2429
01:59:52,125 --> 01:59:53,166
[imperceptible]

2430
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:54,416
[Jimmy] <i>So this is how</i>

2431
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:57,333
Fitz says he wants my old pal Dave Johnson

2432
01:59:57,416 --> 02:00:00,041
to step down so he can have his son

2433
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:02,625
take over Local 299.

2434
02:00:03,125 --> 02:00:07,333
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son,
little fucking Fitz.

2435
02:00:08,791 --> 02:00:09,958
[Fitz] She looked a lot like your mother.

2436
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:11,875
- About the same size.
- Pops, come on, you told me...

2437
02:00:11,958 --> 02:00:14,291
Good-looking girl.
She was a good-looking girl.

2438
02:00:14,375 --> 02:00:16,666
But I had no idea
that it wasn't your mother.

2439
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,583
It was dark and...

2440
02:00:26,916 --> 02:00:29,458
[Jimmy] <i>This is how</i>
<i>Fitz says he doesn't like</i>

2441

2442
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,041
<i>By firing my wife from her</i>

Yeah, it's all puff.
It's got no substance, nothing.

2483
02:02:37,375 --> 02:02:39,291
Maybe he means what he says.

- Tony, he's campaigning.
- [Fat Tony] Russ.

2485

[Fat Tony] I don't care
if he's campaigning.

2487

He can't talk like that.

2488

It's no fucking good.

2489
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:51,375
- I understand what you're saying.
- You know what he should do, Russ?

2490
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:53,583
He should cash in that big pension of his.

2491

Spend more time with his grandchildren.

02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:58,291

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

2494
02:03:00,458 --> 02:03:01,791

I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:15,958
But there I was with some people

2500
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,875
and they were saying,
and you know who they are...

2501
02:03:17,958 --> 02:03:19,083
They were saying...

2502
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:23,041
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy."

2503
02:03:23,875 --> 02:03:26,083
We don't want any problem.

02:03:36,791 --> 02:03:37,666
Who said it?

2509
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:41,958
- It don't matter who said it.
- Oh, it matters.

2510
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:43,791
- Was it Russell? No.
- No.

2511
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:46,583
Of course it's not Russell.
It's that little cocksucker

2512
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:48,625
from the Miami fiasco?

2513
02:03:48,708 --> 02:03:49,833
- No?
- No.

2514
02:03:49,916 --> 02:03:51,666
Not him. No?

2515
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,666
Then who?

02:03:54,083 --> 02:03:55,250
[sighs heavily]

2517
02:03:55,333 --> 02:03:56,750
I'm gonna tell you.

2518
02:03:56,833 --> 02:03:57,958
Tony.

2519
02:03:58,041 --> 02:03:58,958
Tony?

2520
02:03:59,708 --> 02:04:01,000
Which Tony?

2521
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:03,083
They're all named Tony. [chuckles]

2522
02:04:03,166 --> 02:04:05,125
I mean, what's the matter with Italians?

2523
02:04:05,208 --> 02:04:07,666
They can only think of one name.

- I know you are.

02:04:37,416 --> 02:04:38,750
- I know that.
- for anyone.

2534
02:04:38,833 --> 02:04:42,333
I know that, you know that,
they don't know that.

2535
02:04:44,083 --> 02:04:47,541
That's who I am, that's what I am
and that's what I'm gonna do.

2536
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:50,791
Somebody can tell him that.

2537
02:04:50,875 --> 02:04:52,166
He said that?

2538
02:04:52,958 --> 02:04:54,166
In so many words, you know.

2539
02:04:54,250 --> 02:04:56,291
Well, before he says something like that,

2540
02:04:56,375 --> 02:04:58,000
he should remember
that Joe Gallo liked to make

2541
02:04:58,083 --> 02:04:59,791
a lot of fucking noise, too.

2542
02:04:59,875 --> 02:05:01,416
Somebody should tell him that.

2543
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,791
Who said?

2544
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:05,708
- Tony.
- He said that?

2545
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:08,166
Oh, that's it. That does it.

2546
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:11,333
I'm never gonna retire now.

2547
02:05:12,583 --> 02:05:13,958
Somebody can tell him that.

2548
02:05:14,041 --> 02:05:15,666
Jimmy, I did tell him.
I told him over and over.

2549
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:18,375
All right, you told him.
Let's stop this, then. Forget it.

2550
02:05:18,458 --> 02:05:19,666
Enough.

2551
02:05:20,416 --> 02:05:22,208
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

2552
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:28,791
What's the matter?

2553
02:05:29,458 --> 02:05:30,708
Nothing.

2554
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:31,666
What?

2555
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:33,000
- Oh, nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

2556
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:34,708
Come on, you're thinking something. What?

2557
02:05:35,458 --> 02:05:37,041
I just... [hesitates]

2558
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:39,958
What? Come on. What are you doing?

2559
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:42,000
- It ain't the right time.
- What do you mean?

2560
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:43,833
It is the right time.
What isn't the right time?

2561
02:05:43,916 --> 02:05:45,041
Say it.

2562
02:05:47,083 --> 02:05:49,041
Uh, the Local's putting together

2563
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:51,666
a testimonial dinner for me and...

2564
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:53,666
A testimonial dinner for you, that's good.

2565
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:55,791
Yeah. But later... Later, when...

2566
02:05:56,375 --> 02:05:57,291
What's the matter?

2567
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:04,291
Uh, I was gonna ask you if you would...

2568
02:06:04,375 --> 02:06:06,000
present the award to me.

2569
02:06:07,291 --> 02:06:08,416
Well...

2570
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:10,791
That's nice of you, Frank.

2571
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:13,208
Really. That's nice of you.
And, you know...

2572
02:06:13,791 --> 02:06:14,833
Who's gonna be there?

2573
02:06:14,916 --> 02:06:17,541
- [inhales deeply] Everybody.
- Tony.

2574
02:06:18,375 --> 02:06:21,708
Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony, huh?

2575
02:06:21,791 --> 02:06:24,708
- [both chuckle]
- Everybody from Downtown.

2576
02:06:25,791 --> 02:06:28,250
Nah. Nah, it ain't a good idea.
Everybody's gonna be there.

2577
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:31,041
People... You're gonna be uncomfortable.

2578
02:06:31,125 --> 02:06:34,208
I don't give a fuck who's there.

2579
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:35,708
We gonna let those cocksuckers

2580
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:38,791
keep me from your big night?
There's no way.

2581
02:06:38,875 --> 02:06:40,000
No.

2582
02:06:40,083 --> 02:06:43,833
I'm gonna be there.
And I'll be honored to be there.

2583
02:06:43,916 --> 02:06:45,125
You deserve this.

2584
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:47,041
- Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.
- Yeah.

2585
02:06:50,291 --> 02:06:52,750
- Ooh, that Mo Dean.
- Yeah.

2586
02:06:53,541 --> 02:06:55,250
- [Jimmy] She's a good-looking broad.
- She's nice.

2587

[man 2 on TV] <i>I did not realize</i>

2588
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:58,791

worked most of the time</i>

02:06:58,875 --> 02:07:01,916

in the plumbers unit until after June...</i>

2590

He's a rat, but that's, you know...

2591
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:05,708
He's a rat. But he's a smart rat.

[man over mic] We've got a great crowd

2594
02:07:10,708 --> 02:07:12,625
for Frank tonight, huh?
Come on. Give it up.

2595

[cheering and applauding]

2596
02:07:16,041 --> 02:07:20,125
That's because Frank is a man
with a lot of friends.

2597
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:22,208
[all applauding]

2598
02:07:22,291 --> 02:07:25,166
From his war buddies
who fought with him in Italy

under General George Patton...

- of Frank's tonight.
- [all cheering]

02:07:43,041 --> 02:07:44,500
Friends of Frank.

2610
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:00,041
Hey, they like you, Frank.

2611
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:02,958
And, of course, our featured speaker,

2612
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:04,750
James Riddell Hoffa.

2613

[all cheering and applauding]

2614
02:08:12,416 --> 02:08:14,583
And meanwhile, outside in the trees,

2615
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:16,291
we got the FBI.

2616
02:08:16,375 --> 02:08:17,416
[crowd laughing]

2617
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,041

[crowd laughing]

2619
02:08:21,208 --> 02:08:23,083
Now, let me tell you
about the first time I met Frank.

2620
02:08:23,166 --> 02:08:24,916
He took me out to a steak dinner,

2621
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,458
and he asked me, he said,
"How do you like your steak?"

2622
02:08:27,541 --> 02:08:29,416
I said, "I like it rare."
He said, "Me too."

2623
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:31,583
Well, they bring out the steaks.
Mine's rare.

2624
02:08:31,666 --> 02:08:33,500
Frank's was still walking
from the kitchen.

2625
02:08:33,583 --> 02:08:35,375
[crowd laughing]

2626
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:37,458
He turns to me, he said, "Well, you know",

2627
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:39,500
I'm an animal lover.
I don't wanna hurt it."

2628
02:08:39,583 --> 02:08:40,583
[crowd laughing]

2629
02:08:41,875 --> 02:08:42,875
He's an animal lover.

2630
02:08:42,958 --> 02:08:44,583
[crowd laughing and applauding]

2631
02:08:46,458 --> 02:08:47,458
Oh.

2632
02:08:49,125 --> 02:08:51,708
[gentle jazz music playing]

2633
02:09:07,416 --> 02:09:11,166
This guy is not even the goddamn president
and he's holding up people's loans.

2634
02:09:12,125 --> 02:09:13,875
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

2635
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:15,583
And how's he supposed to do that?

2636
02:09:15,666 --> 02:09:16,791
Because his guys
are holding 'em back loans

2637
02:09:16,875 --> 02:09:19,125
on Carlos's new hotel in New Orleans,

2638
02:09:19,208 --> 02:09:21,166
the add-on that we're doing at Caesars.

2639
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,125
- And what's Fitz doing all this time?
- Fitz?

2640
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:29,958
Yeah, he's supposed to help
with this shit.

2641
02:09:30,041 --> 02:09:32,041
The money comes
from the Pension Fund trustees.

2642
02:09:32,125 --> 02:09:33,708
They gotta sign off on it.

2643
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:35,875
They're supposed to be rubber-stamping
what Fitz says.

2644
02:09:35,958 --> 02:09:38,250
- Right, right. Yeah.
- Except Jimmy

2645
02:09:38,333 --> 02:09:40,583
has a couple of them
to stop rubber-stamping.

2646
02:09:42,666 --> 02:09:44,541
The son of a bitch.

2647
02:09:44,625 --> 02:09:46,041
I thought we took care of that.

2648
02:09:47,583 --> 02:09:48,833
[Fat Tony] You know
what he told somebody?

2649
02:09:48,916 --> 02:09:50,958
He goes, once Fitz is out and he's in,

2650
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:53,125
he's gonna call in the old loans.

2651
02:09:53,208 --> 02:09:56,875
Hotels, casinos, real estate,
no matter what it is.

2652
02:09:56,958 --> 02:09:59,125
And if you don't have his money
and interest in two seconds,

2653
02:09:59,208 --> 02:10:00,416
he's taking 'em over.

2654
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:02,000
We can't have that.

2655
02:10:04,791 --> 02:10:06,708
- He said that?
- He said that.

2656
02:10:06,791 --> 02:10:08,208
You sure he said that, Tony?

2657
02:10:08,291 --> 02:10:09,791
He said that.

2658
02:10:09,875 --> 02:10:11,791
Everything I'm telling you, yeah, he said.

2659
02:10:11,875 --> 02:10:13,958
I mean, who does he think he is? Castro?

It'll always be your union.

You could step down and still run it.

No, you don't step down.
What do you mean?

to run a union.

I can't help but think, I'm sorry,

2682
02:11:08,208 --> 02:11:10,291
but is there another reason or something?

02:11:10,375 --> 02:11:13,166
This is my union!
What do you mean, "another reason"?

This is my union.

and then try to understand things.

I might...

2691

You might be demonstrating
a failure to show appreciation.

2692
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,000
I'm not showing appreciation?

2693
02:11:42,041 --> 02:11:43,958
According to, you know, some people.

2694
02:11:44,041 --> 02:11:46,916
I went to school for five fucking years.

2695
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,500

- Five fucking years.

was finish my ice cream in peace.

2703
02:12:08,083 --> 02:12:09,541
[chuckles softly]

2704
02:12:09,625 --> 02:12:10,625
This cocksucker

2705
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:14,125
shows up at a meeting 15 minutes late,

2706
02:12:14,916 --> 02:12:16,625
wearing fucking shorts!

2707
02:12:17,625 --> 02:12:20,083
- Who wears shorts to a meeting?
- Nobody.

2708
02:12:20,166 --> 02:12:21,625
- That's right.
- Nobody.

2709
02:12:22,541 --> 02:12:24,250
I'm not showing appreciation?

2710
02:12:24,333 --> 02:12:25,166
It's not me.

2711
02:12:25,875 --> 02:12:26,875
According to some people...

2712
02:12:26,958 --> 02:12:29,166
No, I know it's not you. Some people...

2713
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:32,083
Some people say
I'm not showing appreciation?

2714
02:12:32,166 --> 02:12:33,458
Well, then fuck them.

2715
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:35,791
I'm trying to help you, Jim.

2716
02:12:35,875 --> 02:12:36,875
I know you are.

2717
02:12:37,583 --> 02:12:39,541
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

2722
02:13:01,375 --> 02:13:03,708
[Jimmy] He has done it as a driver,

2723
02:13:03,791 --> 02:13:06,125
he has done it as an organizer,

2724
02:13:06,208 --> 02:13:08,958
and I don't think
many of you here know this,

2725
02:13:09,041 --> 02:13:11,583
but Frank holds a record.

2726
02:13:12,458 --> 02:13:16,166
It's most arrests on the picket line.

2727
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:17,416
[crowd laughs]

2728
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:20,291

in 24 hours, beating my record.

[crowd laughs and cheers]

2731
02:13:26,041 --> 02:13:29,500
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no exaggeration.

2732
02:13:31,083 --> 02:13:32,791
He is a union man

2733

- to his bones.
- [crowd applauding]

2734
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:37,291
Which side are you on?

2735
02:13:37,375 --> 02:13:38,833
[all] Your side!

2736
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:39,916
Whose side?

2737
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
[all] Your side!

2738
02:13:41,083 --> 02:13:42,125
My side.

2739
02:13:42,208 --> 02:13:43,125
[all] Your side.

2740
02:13:43,208 --> 02:13:44,875
- His side.
- [all] Yeah!

2741
02:13:44,958 --> 02:13:46,208
[Jimmy] There it is.

2742
02:13:46,958 --> 02:13:50,541
And so, it is an honor for me
to be here tonight

2743
02:13:50,625 --> 02:13:52,416
to present this award

2744
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,666
to my dear friend,

2745
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,916
Mr. Frank Sheeran!

2746
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,666
[all cheering and applauding]

2747
02:14:06,458 --> 02:14:08,708
Thank you, Jimmy, thank you so much.

2748
02:14:09,666 --> 02:14:12,125
And thank you to my lovely wife Reenie

2749
02:14:12,208 --> 02:14:14,583
for being here with me.

2750
02:14:14,666 --> 02:14:17,333

Maryanne,

2752
02:14:18,916 --> 02:14:20,541
Dolores, Connie,

2753
02:14:20,625 --> 02:14:22,916
Peggy, for putting up with me

2754
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,666
for all these years. [chuckles]

2755
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:28,791
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you
what this means to me

2756
02:14:28,875 --> 02:14:30,166
to get this honor from you.

2757
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:34,208
It's the highlight of my life.
Thank you very, very much.

2758
02:14:34,291 --> 02:14:37,541
And this man, James Riddell Hoffa,

2759
02:14:38,291 --> 02:14:40,541
is the guy that gets the job done.

I'm behind you, Jimmy.

2762
02:14:44,833 --> 02:14:45,875
All the way.

2763
02:14:47,791 --> 02:14:49,000
In any case,

2764
02:14:49,083 --> 02:14:51,458
from the deepest part of my heart,
I thank you all.

2765
02:14:51,541 --> 02:14:53,333
'Cause I don't really deserve all this.

2766
02:14:54,458 --> 02:14:57,125
But I have bursitis
and I don't deserve that either.

2767

[crowd laughs]

2768
02:14:58,916 --> 02:15:01,208
Thank you all tonight
and thank you for coming.

in the world have one of these.

2781

And only one of them is Irish.

2782

I have one.

2783
02:16:39,458 --> 02:16:40,790
Angelo has one.

2784
02:16:43,333 --> 02:16:44,458
Now you have one.

2785
02:16:49,333 --> 02:16:50,500
This is beautiful.

2786
02:16:54,583 --> 02:16:57,250
I... I don't...
I don't know what to say, Russ. It's...

2787
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:00,125
Slip it on. See how it looks.

2788
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:05,915
- Feel good?
- [Frank] Yeah.

2789
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,958
You know how strong I made you?
You know how strong?

2790
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:12,625
[kisses and pats Frank]

2791
02:17:12,708 --> 02:17:13,833
You're my kid.

2792
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,415
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

2793
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:18,583
Nobody.

2795
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,833
[indistinct chatter]

2796
02:17:44,333 --> 02:17:45,875
[Russell] Listen, Frank.

2797
02:17:46,665 --> 02:17:49,750
Things have gotten out of hand
with our friend again.

2798
02:17:50,915 --> 02:17:54,208
And some people are having
serious problems with him.

2799
02:17:55,083 --> 02:17:57,708
And, uh, it's at a point where

2800
02:17:57,790 --> 02:18:00,333
you're gonna have to talk to him
and tell him

2801
02:18:01,333 --> 02:18:02,833
it's what it is.

2802
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:06,625
What it is?

2803
02:18:06,708 --> 02:18:08,708
Yes. It's what they want.

2804
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,540
It's where it's gotten.

2805
02:18:12,125 --> 02:18:14,875
You're close to him.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

2806
02:18:14,958 --> 02:18:16,375
You know I talked to him.

2807
02:18:16,458 --> 02:18:18,458
He's a tough guy to talk to.
You know him.

2808
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,125
He has no choice.

2809
02:18:20,208 --> 02:18:21,750
He has no choice.

2810
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,875
These are the higher-ups.

2811
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:28,040
Well, he's a higher-up too.
I mean... No?

2812
02:18:29,165 --> 02:18:30,875
Not like this. You know that.

2813
02:18:30,958 --> 02:18:32,665
Oh, come on now, Frank.

2814
02:18:35,875 --> 02:18:37,915
If they can whack a president,

2815
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,833
they can whack a president of the union.

2816
02:18:41,833 --> 02:18:44,333
You know it and I know it.

2817
02:18:54,708 --> 02:18:56,500
I talk to this guy,
I talk to him, I talk to him,

2818
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:58,040
I talk to him, he don't listen.

2819
02:18:58,125 --> 02:19:00,458
But he's gotta listen now.
I gotta make him listen.

2820
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:02,750
[sighs]

2821
02:19:02,833 --> 02:19:06,000
That ain't right. He's...
He's a fucking knucklehead.

2822
02:19:10,708 --> 02:19:12,165
[continues singing]

2823
02:19:17,083 --> 02:19:18,083
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

2824
02:19:18,165 --> 02:19:19,790
I talked to Russ.

2825
02:19:19,875 --> 02:19:21,083
He talked to Tony.

2826
02:19:21,165 --> 02:19:22,375
He means what he's saying.

2827
02:19:23,375 --> 02:19:25,333
- Who? Russ?
- No, Tony.

2828
02:19:25,415 --> 02:19:26,540
- Tony?
- Yeah.

2829
02:19:27,415 --> 02:19:28,875
Well, I mean what I'm saying. [scoffs]

2830
02:19:29,790 --> 02:19:33,500
He can't seem to get that
through his fat, fucking Sicilian head.

2831
02:19:33,583 --> 02:19:35,333
Can he? Don't worry about it.

2832
02:19:35,415 --> 02:19:36,665
What's the matter with you?

2833
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:38,165
You... You look...

2834
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:39,208
- I'm concerned.
- Yeah, I know.

2835
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:41,333
You look concerned.
What are you concerned about?

2836
02:19:41,415 --> 02:19:42,290
I'm... I'm...

2837
02:19:42,375 --> 02:19:43,833
They should be concerned.

2838
02:19:43,915 --> 02:19:45,333
- They are. They are.
- Well, let them be.

2839
02:19:45,415 --> 02:19:48,500
They're more than a little concerned.
There's widespread concern.

2840
02:19:48,583 --> 02:19:49,833
It's a big problem.

2841
02:19:51,333 --> 02:19:54,916
Tony told the old man
to tell me to tell you...

2842
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,833
- Hmm.
- "It's what it is."

2843
02:20:01,125 --> 02:20:02,000
What it is?

2844
02:20:02,083 --> 02:20:03,166
It's what it is.

2845
02:20:07,166 --> 02:20:08,416
Please, listen to me.

2846
02:20:10,666 --> 02:20:12,500
They wouldn't dare. [scoffing]

2847
02:20:12,583 --> 02:20:14,333
- Don't...
- They wouldn't dare.

2848
02:20:14,416 --> 02:20:16,250
- Jimmy...
- Please, Frank, come on.

2849
02:20:16,333 --> 02:20:18,000
- Don't say they wouldn't dare.
- No.

2850
02:20:18,083 --> 02:20:21,208
Don't... Don't tell me that kinda...
That's fairy tales.

2851
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:22,958
No, don't say they wouldn't dare.

2852
02:20:23,541 --> 02:20:26,166
If something funny happens to me...

2853
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:29,208
they're done.

2854
02:20:29,291 --> 02:20:31,166
You understand that? And they know it.

2855
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:33,833
Because I got files. I got proof.

2856
02:20:33,916 --> 02:20:34,958
I got records.

2857
02:20:35,041 --> 02:20:38,166
I got tapes.
Any time I want, they'll be gone.

2858
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:39,541
These Guinea motherfuckers

2859
02:20:39,625 --> 02:20:41,916
will spend
the rest of their lives in jail,

2860
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,583
and they know it.

2861
02:20:44,375 --> 02:20:45,250
They know it.

2862
02:20:45,333 --> 02:20:47,416
But what you're saying
is what they're concerned about.

2863
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:49,083
What I'm saying is I know things.

2864
02:20:49,166 --> 02:20:52,166
I know things they don't know I know.

2865
02:20:52,958 --> 02:20:55,125
- Please...
- Are you gonna take that chance?

2866
02:20:55,208 --> 02:20:57,041
What chance am I...
Why should I be taking a chance?

2867
02:20:57,125 --> 02:20:58,541
They're saying this is it.

2868
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,083
They're saying this is it,
and then it's it?

2869
02:21:01,166 --> 02:21:03,583
Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank. Come on.

2870
02:21:03,666 --> 02:21:05,083
Jimmy, I'm trying to tell you something.

2871
02:21:05,166 --> 02:21:07,375
I know you are. You're telling me
that they're threatening me

2872
02:21:07,458 --> 02:21:08,875
and I gotta do what they say.

2873
02:21:08,958 --> 02:21:11,875
It's more than a threat.
It's the bottom line.

2874
02:21:11,958 --> 02:21:12,875
The bottom line.

2875
02:21:13,791 --> 02:21:14,958
It's what it is.

2876
02:21:15,041 --> 02:21:17,541
They do something to me,
I do something to them.

2877
02:21:18,708 --> 02:21:20,541
That's all I know.
I don't know anything else. Do you?

2878
02:21:23,625 --> 02:21:25,666
So what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna tell McGee?

2879
02:21:26,625 --> 02:21:28,125
That you're not gonna listen?

2880
02:21:28,208 --> 02:21:29,375
He ain't used to people
not listening to him.

2881
02:21:29,458 --> 02:21:30,458
Well, neither am I.

2882
02:21:32,125 --> 02:21:34,000
- What?
- Neither am I.

2883
02:21:34,083 --> 02:21:35,750
- [groans]
- Then I don't know what to do.

2884
02:21:35,833 --> 02:21:37,541
I mean, maybe you should
get some bodies around you

2885
02:21:37,625 --> 02:21:39,541
- for protection.
- Oh, come on. Please.

2886
02:21:39,625 --> 02:21:41,208
I'm not gonna go that route.

2887
02:21:41,291 --> 02:21:42,833
[chuckling] Don't do this to me, Frank.

2888
02:21:42,916 --> 02:21:45,375
What do you mean, "bodies around me"?
I don't need...

2889
02:21:45,458 --> 02:21:47,833
You put bodies around you,
then they go after your family.

2890
02:21:47,916 --> 02:21:50,166
- It doesn't matter. You worried?
- I'm worried.

2891
02:21:50,250 --> 02:21:52,333
Get some bodies around you.
I'll tell you why.

2892
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:55,083
This could happen to you.

2893
02:21:55,166 --> 02:21:56,833
They could come after you

2894
02:21:57,416 --> 02:21:59,208
since you're with me.

2895
02:21:59,291 --> 02:22:00,166
No?

2896
02:22:02,791 --> 02:22:04,375
I'm worried.

2897
02:22:04,458 --> 02:22:06,208
Tell Russ I got nothing
but respect for him.

2898
02:22:06,916 --> 02:22:09,375
I got a little trouble with him.

2899
02:22:09,458 --> 02:22:11,625
We were talking before
and I just got a little crazy.

2900
02:22:11,708 --> 02:22:13,583
You know how I am. I just blow.

2901
02:22:13,666 --> 02:22:14,791
- Sometimes.
- Yeah.

2902
02:22:14,875 --> 02:22:16,208
I just walked away like that.

2903
02:22:16,291 --> 02:22:18,291
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

2904
02:22:18,375 --> 02:22:20,750
Maybe you could tell him
how much I respect him.

2905
02:22:21,625 --> 02:22:23,333
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

2906
02:22:24,166 --> 02:22:25,666
I would never hurt him,

2907
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:28,708
no matter what I do with files,
or whatever I do with anything.

2908
02:22:28,791 --> 02:22:31,250
But you should tell him. Yourself.

2909
02:22:31,333 --> 02:22:32,208
No, I'm not gonna tell him myself.

2910
02:22:32,291 --> 02:22:33,541
- Please.
- Oh, come on.

2911
02:22:33,625 --> 02:22:35,583
- It would go a long way.
- He's your rabbi.

2912
02:22:36,333 --> 02:22:38,250
Because of him, you're here.

2913
02:22:38,333 --> 02:22:39,250
You tell him.

2914
02:22:40,125 --> 02:22:41,083
Listen to me.

2915
02:22:41,166 --> 02:22:43,708
At the end,
there's only one thing that's real.

2916
02:22:44,791 --> 02:22:46,541
This is my union.

2917
02:22:48,375 --> 02:22:51,375
This is my union, Frank.

2918
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:55,541
Very simple when you say it that way.

2919
02:23:01,083 --> 02:23:02,375
Peggy!

2920
02:23:02,458 --> 02:23:04,000
Shall we dance?

2921
02:23:04,083 --> 02:23:05,416
Excuse us.

2922
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:08,625
[gentle jazz music playing]

2923
02:23:09,708 --> 02:23:11,125

2924
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:39,416
[Frank] <i>A couple of hours outside Detroit,</i>

2925
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:41,833
<i>we figured we'd spend the night,</i>

2926
02:23:41,916 --> 02:23:43,750
<i>drive up in the morning.</i>

2927
02:23:43,833 --> 02:23:45,291
<i>I mean, the wedding, that was the thing.</i>

2928
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:50,208
<i>Bill Bufalino was giving
his daughter away to a hell of a guy.</i>

2929
02:23:50,291 --> 02:23:52,750
<i>Better than the bum she was with before.</i>

2930
02:23:52,833 --> 02:23:54,416
<i>And that was all well and good.</i>

2931
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,291
<i>But the wedding
was really a peace mission.</i>

2932
02:23:59,458 --> 02:24:00,666
<i>And that's what we were there for.</i>

2933
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:02,541
<i>And everybody kinda knew that,</i>

2934
02:24:02,625 --> 02:24:04,541
<i>and we were there
to straighten it all out.</i>

2935
02:24:05,166 --> 02:24:06,750
- Hey, Jimmy?
- [Jimmy on phone] <i>Yeah.</i>

2936
02:24:06,833 --> 02:24:08,375
I'm with the old man, we're driving up.

2937
02:24:08,458 --> 02:24:11,000
<i>He hopes we can straighten
this whole thing out.</i>

2938
02:24:11,083 --> 02:24:12,750
- What did he say?
<i>- He said he hopes</i>

2939
02:24:12,833 --> 02:24:14,166
we can straighten it out.
After the wedding,

2940
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:16,250
we sit down, we talk,
we straighten it out.

2941
02:24:16,333 --> 02:24:17,458
<i>Right, the wedding.</i>

2942
02:24:17,541 --> 02:24:18,916
I'm not going to the wedding.

2943
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,125
Too many people I don't like
are gonna be there,

2944
02:24:21,208 --> 02:24:22,583
<i>so I'm not going to the wedding.</i>

2945
02:24:22,666 --> 02:24:24,166
You're not going to the wedding?

2946
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:25,666
I'm not gonna be there.

2947
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:28,916
Well, then we could...

2948
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,500
Jimmy, then we could do it
anywhere you want.

2949
02:24:30,583 --> 02:24:32,666
We can do it at your house.

2950
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:34,041
We can do it anywhere you want.

2951
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:35,166
<i>Wherever you're comfortable.</i>

2952
02:24:36,333 --> 02:24:37,291
The lake?

2953
02:24:37,375 --> 02:24:39,666
Yeah, the lake.
You wanna do it at the lake?

2954
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:43,625
Oh, from day one,
I wanted to work this out.

2955
02:24:43,708 --> 02:24:46,750
- I know. I know.
- From day fucking one.

2956
02:24:46,833 --> 02:24:49,416
I know. Nobody knows better than me.
I know that.

2957
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:50,666
<i>All right, uh...</i>

2958
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:52,583
Just you two, right?

2959
02:24:52,666 --> 02:24:54,500
I mean, not the Little Guy.

2960
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:56,291
- No, of course, the Little Guy.
<i>- No.</i>

2961
02:24:56,375 --> 02:24:58,416
I'm not doing it with him.

2962
02:24:58,500 --> 02:24:59,833
Jimmy, there's no point
just the three of us.

2963
02:24:59,916 --> 02:25:01,041
No, no. No, no.

2964
02:25:01,125 --> 02:25:03,333
Just the three of us.
That's the way it's...

2965
02:25:03,416 --> 02:25:04,958
There's no point just the three of us.

2966
02:25:05,041 --> 02:25:06,291
It's gotta be the Little Guy with us.

2967
02:25:06,375 --> 02:25:08,833
No, I'm not sitting down
with that little cocksucker again!

2968
02:25:08,916 --> 02:25:11,375
Do you understand? I can't do it, Frank!

2969
02:25:11,458 --> 02:25:13,375
You have to.
No, Jimmy, you gotta sit down with him.

2970
02:25:13,458 --> 02:25:14,458
<i>We don't gotta do anything.</i>

2971
02:25:14,541 --> 02:25:16,708
This is a courtesy with these people.

2972
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:18,125
A complete courtesy.

2973
02:25:18,208 --> 02:25:19,500
- You know that.
<i>- I understand.</i>

2974
02:25:19,583 --> 02:25:21,166
But you gotta try and move past that.

2975
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:22,833
Get past it? I am past it!

2976
02:25:22,916 --> 02:25:24,958
I'm never seeing that motherfucker again.

2977
02:25:25,041 --> 02:25:27,375
Jimmy, you gotta sit down.
Everybody says so.

2978
02:25:27,458 --> 02:25:29,833
But there's no point.
There's only one point,

2979
02:25:29,916 --> 02:25:31,916
I don't wanna do it
and I'm not gonna do it.

2980
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,500
Frank, I'm gonna hang up on you now.

2981
02:25:33,583 --> 02:25:35,583
Please. Understand this. Okay?

2982
02:25:49,416 --> 02:25:52,041
- [Russell] What did he say?
- Uh, he's thinking about it.

2983
02:25:52,666 --> 02:25:54,750
- Thinking about it? [chuckles]
- [Frank] Yeah.

2984
02:26:01,791 --> 02:26:02,625
That's for you.

2985
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,166
[Russell] Well, that's good. Okay.

2986
02:26:13,291 --> 02:26:15,458
[coins clinking in payphone]

2987
02:26:25,625 --> 02:26:26,583
What time you got, Frank?

2988
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:29,333
Uh, about five.

2989
02:26:29,416 --> 02:26:30,500
Five, huh?

2990
02:26:33,083 --> 02:26:34,666
Maybe you should give Jimmy a call.

2991
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:36,750
I mean, he said
he was gonna think about it, right?

2992
02:26:43,083 --> 02:26:43,916
Okay.

2993
02:26:55,166 --> 02:26:56,625
So when are you getting in?

2994
02:26:56,708 --> 02:26:58,000
Uh, tomorrow morning.

2995
02:26:58,083 --> 02:26:59,958
<i>Oh, that's good.
That's good, 'cause, uh...</i>

2996
02:27:00,541 --> 02:27:02,875
I changed my mind about the other thing.

2997
02:27:04,375 --> 02:27:06,166
- You did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

2998
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:09,500
Yeah, I'm gonna meet, uh,
with the Little Guy tomorrow afternoon.

2999
02:27:10,541 --> 02:27:11,625
With the lit...

3000
02:27:11,708 --> 02:27:12,916
- With the Little Guy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

3001
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,833
Uh, Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

3002
02:27:15,916 --> 02:27:17,750
<i>Jack's good. I met with him a few times</i>

3003
02:27:17,833 --> 02:27:19,625
after that, you know, Miami fiasco.

3004
02:27:20,208 --> 02:27:21,708
With the Little Guy. Where?

3005
02:27:22,666 --> 02:27:25,750
Same place as before.
You know where it is.

3006
02:27:25,833 --> 02:27:27,000
In public.

3007
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:30,500
You know Tony Jack is Pro's cousin?

3008
02:27:31,291 --> 02:27:32,791
Yeah. So?

3009
02:27:32,875 --> 02:27:34,458
They're all fucking cousins.
What're you gonna do?

3010
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,166
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

3011
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:38,583
Oh, yeah, I want you there.

3012
02:27:38,666 --> 02:27:41,083
That's why I asked
when you're coming in.

3013
02:27:41,166 --> 02:27:42,291
What time's the meeting?

3014
02:27:42,375 --> 02:27:43,291
<i>Two-thirty.</i>

3015
02:27:43,375 --> 02:27:45,875
And he better not be late,
that cocksucker,

3016
02:27:45,958 --> 02:27:47,916
or wearing those fucking shorts.

3017
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,333
Listen, I'm gonna get there at 2:00,
so you should get there at 2:00.

3018
02:27:51,416 --> 02:27:52,625
- Okay?
<i>- I'll be there at 2:00.</i>

3019
02:27:52,708 --> 02:27:55,000
Oh, good. Good. Okay.

3020
02:27:55,083 --> 02:27:56,291
I'll see you at 2:00.

3021
02:27:56,375 --> 02:27:57,708
<i>- Thanks, Frank.</i>
- Okay, Jimmy.

3022
02:27:59,458 --> 02:28:00,333
See you at 2:00.

3023

[coin clinks in payphone]

3024
02:28:06,958 --> 02:28:07,916
What did he say?

3025
02:28:08,833 --> 02:28:09,791
He's gonna meet with Pro.

3026
02:28:12,291 --> 02:28:13,333
Tony Jack set it up.

3027
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:15,333
Very good.

3028
02:28:24,083 --> 02:28:24,958
[knock on door]

3029
02:28:29,916 --> 02:28:32,333
- Hello.
- [Irene] Hello. Good evening.

3030
02:28:33,375 --> 02:28:35,458
- [Carrie] We're starving.
- [Irene] Oh, let's go, let's go.

3031
02:28:42,083 --> 02:28:43,250
It was the best move we made,

3032
02:28:43,333 --> 02:28:45,833
getting this red wine vinegar
from Angelo's guy.

3033
02:28:48,208 --> 02:28:49,500
Great Italian olive oil

3034
02:28:49,583 --> 02:28:52,125
we got from that other mooch
was not bad either.

3035
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,333
Catania olives, what better.

3036
02:28:56,416 --> 02:28:57,333
The best.

3037
02:29:02,208 --> 02:29:03,833
There's been a change.

3038
02:29:04,416 --> 02:29:05,541
Instead of, uh,

3039
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:08,791
going up early,
we're gonna hang around

3040
02:29:08,875 --> 02:29:11,208
tomorrow morning and then go drive up.

3041
02:29:12,166 --> 02:29:15,708
But... But I told Jimmy
that we were gonna be up in the morning.

3042
02:29:17,375 --> 02:29:18,291
[softly] I told Jimmy...

3043
02:29:18,375 --> 02:29:20,541
I told Jimmy we're gonna be
up in the morning.

3044
02:29:20,625 --> 02:29:22,166
I know. I know.

3045
02:29:24,333 --> 02:29:27,875
That I would be there for that...
meeting with Pro.

3046
02:29:27,958 --> 02:29:29,416
- What?
- [whispering] That I'd be...

3047
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:31,625
be there for that meeting with Pro.

3048
02:29:31,708 --> 02:29:32,833
Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

3049
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:39,458
But what I... What am I gonna do?

3050
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:41,750
[sputters]

3051
02:29:41,833 --> 02:29:43,541
We gotta go there. I mean, I gotta go.

3052
02:29:43,625 --> 02:29:45,000
I told him I'd be there.

3053
02:29:48,583 --> 02:29:49,666
Frank...

3054
02:29:50,541 --> 02:29:52,458
we did all we could for the man.

3055
02:29:58,541 --> 02:29:59,875
[Russell smacks lips]

3056
02:30:04,125 --> 02:30:05,208
Don't call him.

3057
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,250
[crickets chirping]

3058
02:30:22,666 --> 02:30:23,916
[dogs barking in distance]

3059
02:30:41,625 --> 02:30:43,958
- Hey. Good morning.
- [Frank] Hey. Morning.

3060
02:30:47,083 --> 02:30:48,583
Want some coffee?

3061
02:30:48,666 --> 02:30:49,708
[Russell] No, I got it here.

3062
02:30:51,583 --> 02:30:53,541
- How'd ya sleep?
- Good. You?

3063
02:30:55,458 --> 02:30:56,333
[Russell] All right.

3064
02:31:00,583 --> 02:31:02,166
Want some Total or Corn Flakes?

3065
02:31:03,041 --> 02:31:04,416
[Frank] Uh, maybe Total.

3066
02:31:12,708 --> 02:31:13,958
That's good, thanks.

3067
02:31:20,958 --> 02:31:23,208
We're gonna take a ride
up to Port Clinton today.

3068
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,250
I thought we were staying here.

3069
02:31:31,791 --> 02:31:33,375
No, the girls are gonna stay here.

3070
02:31:34,375 --> 02:31:36,166
You and me, we're going up and, uh...

3071
02:31:37,833 --> 02:31:39,833
we'll be back three hours tops.

3072
02:31:42,958 --> 02:31:45,833
Oh. But... But what's in Port Clinton?

3073
02:31:46,541 --> 02:31:47,416
A plane.

3074
02:31:51,166 --> 02:31:52,333
A plane? To where?

3075
02:31:53,416 --> 02:31:54,416
Detroit.

3076
02:32:02,166 --> 02:32:03,583
We're going to Detroit now?

3077
02:32:04,333 --> 02:32:06,375
No, you're gonna go to Detroit.

3078
02:32:09,291 --> 02:32:11,166
And when you come back,

3079
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:12,416
me and you,

3080
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:16,125
we get together with the girls,
we take a nice slow drive up.

3081
02:32:17,041 --> 02:32:18,708
With cigarette breaks, you know.

3082
02:32:26,833 --> 02:32:27,833
[Russell sighs]

3083
02:32:30,375 --> 02:32:31,500
Frank.

3084
02:32:32,125 --> 02:32:34,250
I had to put you into this thing,

3085
02:32:35,041 --> 02:32:36,958
or you would never let it happen.

3086
02:32:37,875 --> 02:32:39,416
And I know you wouldn't.

3087
02:32:45,041 --> 02:32:46,541
But it's gonna happen.

3088
02:32:49,208 --> 02:32:50,916
Either way,

3089
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,125
he's going.

3090
02:32:58,333 --> 02:33:00,666
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

3091
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,291
I know how you feel.

3092
02:33:04,125 --> 02:33:06,583
I told you before,
we tried everything to help him.

3093
02:33:06,666 --> 02:33:07,916
You know that.

3094
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,125
You tried.

3095
02:33:12,041 --> 02:33:13,625
He brought this on himself.

3096
02:33:15,958 --> 02:33:17,791
And it's landing on us.

3097
02:33:21,666 --> 02:33:23,166
The only reason they agreed to this

3098
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:26,375
was out of respect to me.

3099
02:33:29,125 --> 02:33:31,000
But you and Reenie will be okay,

3100
02:33:31,708 --> 02:33:33,125
'cause you're with me.

3101
02:33:38,083 --> 02:33:39,333
You're with me.

3102
02:34:18,666 --> 02:34:19,875
Give me your glasses.

3103
02:34:25,333 --> 02:34:26,833
[airplane flying nearby]

3104
02:34:58,166 --> 02:35:00,250
[engine starts]

3105
02:35:56,083 --> 02:35:57,833
[tires skid]

3106
02:36:16,125 --> 02:36:17,375
[keys jingling]

3107
02:37:53,291 --> 02:37:54,416
[engine stops]

3108
02:38:03,416 --> 02:38:04,458
[glove compartment opening]

3109
02:38:41,666 --> 02:38:42,791
[scraping]

3110
02:38:43,916 --> 02:38:44,833
[grunts]

3111
02:38:47,083 --> 02:38:48,000
Hey, Frank.

3112
02:38:49,041 --> 02:38:50,000
Hey, Sal.

3113
02:38:52,333 --> 02:38:54,083
[grunts] Chuckie's late.

3114
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

3115
02:39:30,791 --> 02:39:31,708
[door opens]

3116
02:39:33,541 --> 02:39:34,375
[door closes]

3117
02:39:40,916 --> 02:39:42,916
[car pulling up]

3118
02:39:46,500 --> 02:39:47,833
[car door closes]

3119
02:39:47,916 --> 02:39:48,833
That him?

3120
02:39:53,333 --> 02:39:54,291
[Frank] Yeah.

3121
02:39:56,666 --> 02:39:57,958
[Sally quietly] Jesus.

3122
02:40:02,875 --> 02:40:03,791
I'm Sally.

3123
02:40:04,458 --> 02:40:05,333
[Chuckie] Hi.

3124
02:40:07,125 --> 02:40:09,041
- Hey, Chuck.
- Frank.

3125
02:40:09,125 --> 02:40:11,208
Let's go. I don't want your father
yelling at me for being late.

3126
02:40:11,291 --> 02:40:12,500
Frank, you take the front.

3127
02:40:13,916 --> 02:40:15,541
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

3128
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:17,250
It's wet.

3129
02:40:17,833 --> 02:40:21,708
Yeah, I had a frozen fish
I had to deliver for a friend of mine.

3130
02:40:22,708 --> 02:40:24,041
A fish?

3131
02:40:24,125 --> 02:40:25,416
The seat is wet from a fish?

3132
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:27,166
Yeah, I know.
What do you want me to do about it now?

3133
02:40:27,250 --> 02:40:28,208
- Jesus Christ.
- I'll sit back there.

3134
02:40:28,291 --> 02:40:29,583
No, no, no, it's all right.
You sit in the front.

3135
02:40:29,666 --> 02:40:31,291
I'll sit there.

3136
02:40:31,375 --> 02:40:32,666
[Sally] I'll sit here, you take the front.

3137
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:33,875
No, no.

3138
02:40:33,958 --> 02:40:35,125
I'll sit there.

3139
02:40:38,333 --> 02:40:39,208
- I'm not sitting there.
- Why don't you...

3140
02:40:39,291 --> 02:40:40,291
I'm sitting there.

3141
02:40:42,916 --> 02:40:43,958
All right, sit where you want.

3142
02:40:46,750 --> 02:40:47,958
You want me to get you
a newspaper, Frank?

3143
02:40:48,041 --> 02:40:49,750
[Frank] It's okay. Let's go.
We gotta hurry.

3144
02:41:04,041 --> 02:41:05,041
What kind of fish?

3145
02:41:07,375 --> 02:41:08,375
What?

3146
02:41:10,708 --> 02:41:11,875
What kind of fish?

3147
02:41:13,375 --> 02:41:16,875
Uh... I don't know.
The kind you eat. A fish.

3148
02:41:18,166 --> 02:41:19,291
You don't know what kind?

3149
02:41:21,416 --> 02:41:22,583
No. I don't.

3150
02:41:23,875 --> 02:41:24,916
Where did you get it?

3151
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:28,250
What the fuck. At a fish place.

3152
02:41:30,458 --> 02:41:33,750
What, you just go in there and say,
"Gimme a fish"?

3153
02:41:35,083 --> 02:41:36,208
Pretty much. Yeah.

3154
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,583
You didn't say you want a salmon,

3155
02:41:39,666 --> 02:41:42,208
you want a... haddock, you want a...

3156
02:41:42,833 --> 02:41:43,708
a fucking cod?

3157
02:41:43,791 --> 02:41:46,458
What the fuck does it matter
what kind of fish it was?

3158
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:48,791
Why are you so concerned
about this fish?

3159
02:41:48,875 --> 02:41:50,291
I'm just trying to understand how...

3160
02:41:50,375 --> 02:41:52,708
Does it... [sighs]

3161
02:41:53,500 --> 02:41:56,083
How a person can buy a fish
and not know what kind it was.

3162
02:41:58,625 --> 02:42:00,916
There was a fish waiting for me there.

3163
02:42:01,708 --> 02:42:02,708
Uh...

3164
02:42:04,166 --> 02:42:07,416
I didn't ask what kind of fish it was.
I'm sorry.

3165
02:42:11,125 --> 02:42:12,458
So your friend
had already ordered this fish.

3166
02:42:12,541 --> 02:42:13,666
[Chuckie] Right.

3167
02:42:20,208 --> 02:42:22,958
'Cause I wanna be able to explain this
if somebody asks me.

3168
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:31,583
[Jimmy] Yeah. Absolutely.

3169
02:42:44,541 --> 02:42:45,375
[Chuckie] Dad.

3170
02:42:47,208 --> 02:42:48,208
[Jimmy] Chuckie.

3171
02:42:48,291 --> 02:42:50,416
- Yeah, sorry I'm late. I had to drop off...
- [Jimmy] Late?

3172
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,666
What the fuck are you even doing here?

3173
02:42:52,750 --> 02:42:54,625
- Who invited you?
- [Sally] Hey, Jimmy.

3174
02:42:57,333 --> 02:42:58,791
Who the fuck are you?

3175
02:42:58,875 --> 02:43:00,291
I'm with Pro.

3176
02:43:00,375 --> 02:43:01,458
You're with Pro?

3177
02:43:02,083 --> 02:43:04,416
Are you with the cocksucker
who just stood me up?

3178
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,625
I don't wait for anybody
more than ten minutes.

3179
02:43:06,708 --> 02:43:07,916
He's at the house.

3180
02:43:08,625 --> 02:43:09,625
What house?

3181
02:43:09,708 --> 02:43:10,958
With Russ.

3182
02:43:11,791 --> 02:43:14,375
- Russ? What the fuck is...
- [Sally] Hey, look who's here.

3183
02:43:14,875 --> 02:43:16,375
- [Jimmy] Frank.
- Jimmy.

3184
02:43:16,458 --> 02:43:18,208
What the fuck is going on?

3185
02:43:18,833 --> 02:43:20,958
I was waiting for you.
I was there at two o'clock.

3186
02:43:21,041 --> 02:43:22,125
You were supposed to show.
What happened?

3187
02:43:22,208 --> 02:43:25,083
I'm sorry.
But McGee's here, he decided to come.

3188
02:43:25,166 --> 02:43:27,333
But he ain't comfortable here.
He don't wanna come here.

3189
02:43:27,416 --> 02:43:28,416
He's at the house.

3190
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:30,791
- McGee's in Detroit?
- [Frank] Yeah, he's here.

3191
02:43:30,875 --> 02:43:32,083
He decided to come.

3192
02:43:33,875 --> 02:43:34,708
Oh.

3193
02:43:34,791 --> 02:43:36,875
Yeah, he came to help
straighten this all out.

3194
02:43:38,458 --> 02:43:39,375
The house?

3195
02:43:45,125 --> 02:43:46,750
We'll bring you back after
to get your car.

3196
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:53,583
Yeah.

3197
02:43:55,416 --> 02:43:56,250
Okay.

3198
02:43:59,791 --> 02:44:01,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

3199
02:44:01,791 --> 02:44:03,166
Yeah. [grunts]

3200
02:44:04,791 --> 02:44:06,291
[engine starts]

3201
02:44:06,375 --> 02:44:07,500
[Frank sighs]

3202
02:44:13,208 --> 02:44:14,291
There was a fish in here,

3203
02:44:14,375 --> 02:44:16,708
but we cleaned it up.

3204
02:44:16,791 --> 02:44:17,625
A fish?

3205
02:44:17,708 --> 02:44:18,666
[chuckles]

3206
02:44:19,291 --> 02:44:20,958
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.

3207
02:44:21,041 --> 02:44:21,958
Didn't even know what kind.

3208
02:44:22,041 --> 02:44:24,000
But it's okay now. I wiped it up.

3209
02:44:24,083 --> 02:44:26,958
- I got the handkerchief here.
- Yeah, I can smell it.

3210
02:44:27,041 --> 02:44:27,916
Hey, Chuckie.

3211
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,708
You had a fish in here in your car?

3212
02:44:29,791 --> 02:44:31,500
For Bobby Holmes.

3213
02:44:31,583 --> 02:44:32,958
You know, Bobby likes fish.

3214
02:44:33,583 --> 02:44:35,041
We cleaned it up, Jimmy. It's all right.

3215
02:44:35,125 --> 02:44:36,416
[Jimmy] You cleaned it up?

3216
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:38,333
- You cleaned it up?

that it might tend to incriminate me.

3386
02:55:08,291 --> 02:55:09,625
Okay, let me ask you this:

3387
02:55:10,333 --> 02:55:11,583
what color is my pen?

3388
02:55:14,208 --> 02:55:15,458
[Frank] <i>And everybody took the Fifth.</i>

3389
02:55:15,541 --> 02:55:17,208
<i>I mean, in that situation,</i>

3390
02:55:17,916 --> 02:55:19,416
<i>that's what you do.
What else are you gonna do?</i>

3391
02:55:20,041 --> 02:55:23,125
<i>Still, everybody got indicted or convicted</i>

3392
02:55:23,208 --> 02:55:24,625
<i>on one thing or another,</i>

3393
02:55:24,708 --> 02:55:25,833
<i>but not that.</i>

3394
02:55:25,916 --> 02:55:27,250
<i>Not about Jimmy.</i>

3395
02:55:27,333 --> 02:55:30,291
<i>Nobody, as you know,
even went to jail for that.</i>

3396
02:55:30,375 --> 02:55:32,333
<i>And nobody talked, which is unusual,</i>

3397
02:55:32,416 --> 02:55:35,000
<i>'cause usually,
three people can keep a secret</i>

3398
02:55:35,083 --> 02:55:36,916
<i>only when two of them are dead.</i>

3399
02:55:38,916 --> 02:55:41,458
<i>Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi,</i>

3400
02:55:41,541 --> 02:55:44,916
<i>they got 20 years each
for shaking down a trucking company.</i>

3401
02:55:46,125 --> 02:55:49,208
<i>Pro was convicted with them,
but he was already back in school</i>

3402
02:55:49,291 --> 02:55:51,666
<i>for that other matter
I talked about before.</i>

3403
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:53,583
<i>Well, you remember
that poor union treasurer,</i>

3404
02:55:53,666 --> 02:55:56,458
<i>Tony "Three Fingers,"
who got more votes than Pro?</i>

3405
02:55:56,541 --> 02:55:58,166
<i>They got him on that.</i>

3406
02:55:58,250 --> 02:56:01,541
<i>Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.</i>

3407
02:56:07,375 --> 02:56:10,750
<i>One day, Bugs was seen
walking into the Federal building.</i>

3408
02:56:12,333 --> 02:56:13,833
[Russell] <i>What he did itself</i>
<i>ain't no crime.</i>

3409
02:56:14,541 --> 02:56:17,208
I mean, a lot of people
get called in for things.

3410
02:56:17,291 --> 02:56:19,666
But Sally knows better.

3411
02:56:19,750 --> 02:56:22,000
How come he didn't say anything
to anybody?

3412
02:56:23,208 --> 02:56:25,375
He didn't tell anybody one word.

3413
02:56:25,458 --> 02:56:26,958
Not one word.

3414
02:56:28,291 --> 02:56:30,041
And one thing for sure,

3415
02:56:30,875 --> 02:56:33,041
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

3416
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
[Frank] Sally.

3417
02:56:48,041 --> 02:56:49,833
- What's good?
- Hey, Irish.

3418
02:57:02,083 --> 02:57:05,625
[Frank] <i>Turns out Sally did tell somebody</i>
<i>he had to go in there for something.</i>

3419
02:57:05,708 --> 02:57:07,291
<i>They just forgot to tell somebody else.</i>

3420
02:57:07,375 --> 02:57:09,666
<i>So it was a bad hit.</i>

3421
02:57:12,500 --> 02:57:14,541
<i>Jimmy's son, Chuckie,
you know, his foster son,</i>

3422
02:57:14,625 --> 02:57:16,125
<i>was in the thing, too,</i>

3423
02:57:16,208 --> 02:57:17,541
<i>but he didn't know it.</i>

3424
02:57:18,583 --> 02:57:20,708
<i>All Chuckie knew
was he was pickin' up</i>

3425
02:57:20,791 --> 02:57:22,375
<i>one of Pro's guys and me,</i>

3426
02:57:22,458 --> 02:57:26,541
<i>and we was all gonna pick up his dad
at the Red Fox for a meeting.</i>

3427
02:57:27,166 --> 02:57:30,875
<i>Well, I mean, he was in it, yeah,
you could say that, but stupidly.</i>

3428
02:57:31,666 --> 02:57:34,541
<i>I... I always felt sorry
for Chuckie in this whole thing.</i>

3429
02:57:34,625 --> 02:57:36,250
<i>And I... I still do.</i>

3430
02:57:36,333 --> 02:57:37,708
<i>And the Feds gave him ten months</i>

3431
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:40,541
<i>for some bullshit thing about a car,
and that's about it.</i>

3432
02:57:40,625 --> 02:57:42,125
<i>Who knows what the fuck...</i>

3433
02:57:44,041 --> 02:57:47,125
<i>Fat Tony Salerno,
they got on an income tax thing.</i>

3434
02:57:48,041 --> 02:57:48,958
<i>A little while after,</i>

3435
02:57:49,041 --> 02:57:51,750
<i>he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.</i>

3436
02:57:55,625 --> 02:57:58,750
There's a... a pork store up in, uh...

3437
02:58:00,750 --> 02:58:02,625
northern California.

3438
02:58:03,458 --> 02:58:05,208
Uh, right around...

3439
02:58:06,375 --> 02:58:08,625
Walnut Creek.
You're from up there, ain't you?

3440
02:58:09,333 --> 02:58:10,833
- Yeah.
- [Russell] Yeah.

3441
02:58:10,916 --> 02:58:12,958
And you might even know
the guy that runs it.

3442
02:58:13,791 --> 02:58:16,375
Actually,
I'm looking for a little favor...

3443
02:58:16,458 --> 02:58:18,250
for him, not for me.

3444
02:58:19,208 --> 02:58:22,958
But if you can get him a ticket,
like, to Australia...

3445
02:58:24,458 --> 02:58:25,791
You know what I mean.

3446
02:58:28,291 --> 02:58:29,458
Yeah.

3447
02:58:30,916 --> 02:58:32,916
You want to help him get down there?

3448
02:58:38,458 --> 02:58:39,583
Ye... Yeah.

3449
02:58:39,666 --> 02:58:41,208
[Frank] <i>Now, Russell, he got pinched</i>

3450
02:58:41,291 --> 02:58:44,250
<i>for telling Jimmy the Weasel
to strangle Jack Napoli</i>

3451
02:58:44,333 --> 02:58:46,875
<i>over some beef
about 25 grand of jewelry</i>

3452
02:58:46,958 --> 02:58:48,458
<i>that Jack took on credit</i>

3453
02:58:48,541 --> 02:58:51,416
<i>from Russell and then he never paid for.</i>

3454
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:53,916
<i>Now, with Russ, you don't do that.</i>

3455
02:58:55,083 --> 02:58:58,291
<i>So, only thing is, the Weasel, he flipped.</i>

3456
02:58:58,375 --> 02:58:59,958
<i>He had a wire on him.</i>

3457
02:59:00,041 --> 02:59:02,833
<i>They called it
"conspiracy to kill a witness."</i>

3458
02:59:02,916 --> 02:59:05,916
<i>It was obvious to everybody else
that Napoli was clearly in the wrong.</i>

3459
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,125
<i>I mean, how could you not see that?</i>

3460
02:59:08,208 --> 02:59:10,041
<i>He set him up. It was entrapment.</i>

3461
02:59:10,125 --> 02:59:11,583
<i>What else could you call it?</i>

3462
02:59:11,666 --> 02:59:15,625
<i>But that's another thing</i>
<i>I don't wanna get into now. </i>[mumbles]

3463
02:59:15,708 --> 02:59:16,708
Raise your right hand.

3464
02:59:16,791 --> 02:59:20,083
[Frank] <i>They brought me up on bribery</i>
<i>and labor racketeering charges</i>

3465

[clerk] ...the truth, the whole truth

3467

3468
02:59:24,458 --> 02:59:25,625
- so help you God?
- I do.

3469
02:59:25,708 --> 02:59:28,000
Did you also tell them that Mr. Boffa

3470
02:59:28,083 --> 02:59:30,083
had given you and your wife
luxury vehicles?

3471
02:59:30,166 --> 02:59:33,291
[Frank] Mr. Cole, I worked for 44 years,

3472
02:59:33,375 --> 02:59:37,791
I never took one dime illegal
off Boffa or nobody else.

3473
02:59:37,875 --> 02:59:40,291
You can think whatever you wanna think.
Don't matter to me.

3474
02:59:40,375 --> 02:59:43,333
<i>But all they got me for was
blowing up a crane company</i>

3475
02:59:43,416 --> 02:59:45,416
<i>that fired two of my shop stewards</i>

3476
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:46,833
<i>for no good reason.</i>

3477
02:59:49,291 --> 02:59:51,041
<i>And... And my Lincoln.</i>

3478
02:59:51,666 --> 02:59:54,250
<i>I mean,
I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.</i>

3479
02:59:55,125 --> 02:59:57,458
<i>He leased truck drivers
to freight companies,</i>

3480
02:59:57,541 --> 03:00:00,500
<i>and then he paid them substandard wages.</i>

3481
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:04,708
<i>They said I paid a lot less for the car</i>

3482
03:00:04,791 --> 03:00:06,250
<i>than what it was worth.</i>

3483
03:00:06,833 --> 03:00:08,791
<i>They said the car was a bribe.</i>

3484
03:00:14,916 --> 03:00:16,916
<i>I... I... I loved that car.</i>

3485
03:00:17,625 --> 03:00:21,291
<i>But it wasn't worth the 18 years
they gave me for it.</i>

3486
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:22,250
<i>That's for sure.</i>

3487
03:00:27,583 --> 03:00:29,833
<i>Russell, he had a stroke.</i>

3488
03:00:29,916 --> 03:00:33,375
<i>Fat Tony, he couldn't control
his urine no more.</i>

3489
03:00:33,458 --> 03:00:35,375
<i>And my arthritis</i>

<i>that started in the foxholes of Anzio</i>

3491

<i>was eatin' away at my lower back now,</i>

3492
03:00:40,875 --> 03:00:43,250
<i>and I couldn't feel much

3493
03:00:43,916 --> 03:00:45,250
<i>I needed a cane.</i>

3494

<i>But, you know, they're not gonna
give you a cane in the can</i>

3495
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,750
<i>because they say
you're gonna use it as a weapon.</i>

3496
03:00:50,833 --> 03:00:52,583
<i>There was this medicine, Neurontin,</i>

3497
03:00:52,666 --> 03:00:55,875
<i>it helped me a little bit,

[Russell] He's got it!

3499
03:00:57,333 --> 03:00:58,750
- He's got it!
- [Fat Tony] Ah!

3500

- [Fat Tony] You getting scared now?

- I got no teeth. I can't.

3510
03:01:37,166 --> 03:01:38,333

this is what you want to go home in, no?

3628

on that for you. How about that?

- Six flat cash work for you?
- That's good.

did this whole thing start?</i>

can't figure it out.</i>

<i>It has to be a metal casket,</i>

and they have you in the room.

3648

And all that there.

3649
03:11:14,083 --> 03:11:15,875
It's just not as final. You're dead,

3650
03:11:15,958 --> 03:11:18,125
but it ain't that final.

3651
03:11:21,458 --> 03:11:24,583

Mr. Hoffa's family. His children.

3670

They're here.
And they gotta live not knowing.

3671

[chuckles] Not bad at all.

3690
03:13:22,083 --> 03:13:24,708
And the intention was there.
The intention.

3691
03:13:24,791 --> 03:13:25,875
I know.

3692
03:13:26,541 --> 03:13:28,250
I know the intention is there.

3693
03:13:28,333 --> 03:13:29,666
It was there, Father.

3694
03:13:31,458 --> 03:13:33,458
Do you feel anything for...

3695

for what you've done?

3696
03:13:39,250 --> 03:13:42,583
I, I don't. I mean, maybe that...

3697
03:13:43,708 --> 03:13:45,833
Because I'm here now talking to you,

3698
03:13:45,916 --> 03:13:47,708
that in itself is,

3699
03:13:47,791 --> 03:13:51,000
you know, an attempt to...

3700
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:57,750
But you don't feel anything at all?

3701
03:13:59,500 --> 03:14:00,583
No.

3702
03:14:03,041 --> 03:14:05,750
- Water under the dam.
- Mmm.

3703
03:14:09,291 --> 03:14:11,208
Any... Any remorse

3704
03:14:11,958 --> 03:14:13,416
for the families?

3705
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:15,958
I... I didn't know the families.

3706
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,208
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

3707
03:14:26,791 --> 03:14:29,750
I think we can... we can be sorry...

3708
03:14:29,833 --> 03:14:33,333
We can be sorry
even when we don't feel sorry.

3709
03:14:33,416 --> 03:14:36,458
Well, for us to say,
to make a decision of the will...

03:15:21,750 --> 03:15:22,583
Yeah.

3723
03:15:23,583 --> 03:15:25,416
This time,
we'll do it in our own words. Okay?

3724
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:26,583
Okay.

3725
03:15:28,791 --> 03:15:30,541

3733
03:16:00,083 --> 03:16:01,791
That's my daughter, Peggy.

3734
03:16:01,875 --> 03:16:03,375
- Is it?
- Yeah.

3735
03:16:03,458 --> 03:16:04,916
I don't think I've met her yet.

3736
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:08,000
Well, she...
she ain't been around too much.

3737
03:16:08,083 --> 03:16:09,500
Is she your only child?

3738
03:16:09,583 --> 03:16:11,916
No, I got four daughters.

3739
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,916
Over there. See?

3740
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:15,041
Beautiful.

3741
03:16:15,583 --> 03:16:17,458
- Busy man.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

3742
03:16:19,250 --> 03:16:20,250
Yeah.

3743
03:16:21,250 --> 03:16:22,333
[nurse] Who's that with her?

3744
03:16:24,083 --> 03:16:25,500
You don't know who that is?

3745
03:16:27,458 --> 03:16:28,333
No.

3746
03:16:29,583 --> 03:16:30,708

3747
03:16:32,833 --> 03:16:33,791
Oh, yeah.

[both chuckle]

3750
03:16:37,083 --> 03:16:38,208
You don't know who he is.

3751
03:16:38,291 --> 03:16:40,041
[chuckles] Okay, I don't.

3752
03:16:40,833 --> 03:16:43,250
Yeah. Oh, boy, you don't know how fast

3753
03:16:43,333 --> 03:16:45,708
time goes by until you get there.

3754
03:16:46,500 --> 03:16:48,291
But you don't have to worry about that

3755
03:16:48,375 --> 03:16:50,875
because you have
your whole life ahead of you.

3756
03:16:50,958 --> 03:16:53,291
- Forever. It goes fast, time...
- Hey. [shushing]

Please, please don't talk.

3760
03:17:00,416 --> 03:17:01,333
It's great today.

3761
03:17:01,916 --> 03:17:03,416
I'm still alive?

3762
03:17:03,500 --> 03:17:05,750
- Yes, you are.
- That's good to know.

3763
03:17:06,291 --> 03:17:07,625
Alive and well.

3764
03:17:07,708 --> 03:17:08,833
And you're free

3765
03:17:08,916 --> 03:17:11,625

to put you through all this again.

3766

Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.

3775

- endures forever.

3777
03:17:49,541 --> 03:17:52,833
All right, Frank.
I'll be back to visit, okay? Very soon.

3778
03:17:52,916 --> 03:17:55,333
Probably after the Christmas holidays.

3779
03:17:55,416 --> 03:17:56,958
Oh, okay.

3780
03:17:57,041 --> 03:17:59,833
- Frank, God bless you.
- You too. Thank you.

3781
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,250
It's Christmas?

3782
03:18:04,541 --> 03:18:05,541
Almost.

3783
03:18:06,583 --> 03:18:08,166
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

3784
03:18:10,750 --> 03:18:12,791
- Hey, Father?
- Yup?

3785
03:18:12,875 --> 03:18:15,250
- Do me a favor?
- Mmm-hmm.

3786
03:18:15,333 --> 03:18:18,250
Don't shut the door all the way.
I don't like that. Just...

3787
03:18:18,333 --> 03:18:20,541
- leave it open a little bit.
- Oh, okay.
