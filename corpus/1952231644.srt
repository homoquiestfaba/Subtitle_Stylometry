1
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,778
Empty your mind.

2
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,537
No distraction.
No emotion.

3
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,218
Only calm and clarity.

4
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,377


5
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,256
The Yoroi Bitsu.

6
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,175
Our most sacred chest.

7
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,296
The only remaining object
of the last Koga Ninja.

8
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,774
It is the only final
resting place for the

9
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:28,697
weapons of ninja warriors
through the ages.

10
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:32,054
The powers they
hold are legendary.

11
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,933
Each piece with it's own story,

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,015
Handed down from
generation to generation...

13
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:40,253
for a thousand years.

14
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,805
They were created for
one purpose only.

15
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:47,331
Sudden and violent death.

16
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,091
With these weapons,
the ninja became...

17
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:00,644
Much more than
a mere warrior.

18
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:04,772
He become the most supreme
of the lethal dissilience.

19
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:07,210
And used them for profit
and wars.

20
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:14,205
It became an art as
pure, as it was ruthless.

21
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:20,129
Over the years...

22
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:23,568
The Ninja forged,
the deadliest poisons,

23
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,528
With only one antidote...

24
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,847
They held the power of life,

25
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:31,727
and death.

26
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,447


27
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:42,086


28
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,366


29
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:48,126
Tradition says...

30
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,677
That the Shinobu Katana Sword
has the power to take life.

31
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:54,083
But in the hands of
a true Koga ninja.

32
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,847
He has the power
to restore a life's spirit.

33
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:10,926
The Yoroi Bitsu, and and it's secrets
were pushed from the battlefield,

34
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,442
into the imagination.

35
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,843
But hidden from sight...

36
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,962
safe in this ancient school,

37
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,957
A single Yoroi Bitsu survived

38
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:23,002
and the secret of
the ninja lived on...

39
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,521
transforming the
disciplines of death...

40
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:29,042
into Budo... a martial
art of enlightenment.

41
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,280


42
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,311


43
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,800


44
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,279


45
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,078
- Masazuka.
- Yes!

46
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,479


47
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,718


48
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,317


49
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,078
- Casey!
- Yes!

50
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:04,801


51
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,913


52
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,231


53
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,350


54
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,231


55
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,308


56
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:27,947


57
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:31,514


58
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:12,029
Casey-san. Water?

59
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,664
Thanks, Kiko.

60
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,465
You are always working so late
more than anyone else.

61
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:26,147
I guess I'm not so
good at sitting still.

62
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:31,419
And not so good
at boasta, neither.

63
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,745
Well your father seems
to think I have potential.

64
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,865
So does someone else.

65
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,265
You know, we don't have
time for such things in the Dojo.

66
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,864
No. We don't.

67
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,723
I better get back.

68
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,497


69
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,132
It must have been
very painful, for you.

70
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,056
- It was in the past.
- The past...

71
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,057
Defines a man...

72
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,574
Tradition, heritage...

73
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,055
Your parents.

74
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,415
What's your point?

75
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,175
We have traditions.
What do you have?

76
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,415
A letter and a
photo from a mother,

77
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,288
who abandoned
her only child.

78
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,133
a memory of a drunk father,

79
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,254
who killed himself.

80
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:39,088
Masazuka!

81
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,452


82
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:55,211


83
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,170


84
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:20,203
- Casey!
- Yes!

85
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,727
- Masazuka!
- Yes.

86
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:27,728


87
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,712
Masazuka!

88
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,397


89
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,636


90
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,154


91
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,951


92
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,355


93
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,995
Sensei.

94
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:24,832


95
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,354
Sensei.

96
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:32,237


97
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,192


98
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,592


99
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,431


100
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,426


101
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:01,750


102
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:11,109


103
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,188


104
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,068


105
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,467
Sensei!

106
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,267
Sensei!

107
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:55,261


108
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,583


109
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:10,344
Welcome... brothers.

110
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,060
Tonight, we come together...

111
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,621
for another initiation ceremony.

112
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:24,574
As our ranks and power
continue to grow.

113
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:28,181
Throughout time society...

114
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:31,900
has searched for guides
from select groups of people.

115
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,699
Leaders, we call them.

116
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,935
Men of vision and action.

117
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,537
Do you willingly
accept the bond?

118
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,035


119
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,776
This historic agreement, lays
a foundation for a pipeline

120
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:17,048
that will reach all the
way to the Bering Strait.

121
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,534
Experts who believe,
that the merger of these

122
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:23,418
two Russian companies
will create sufficient capital

123
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,574
to win the bid
for the project.

124
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:28,929
Mr Klimitov will make a statement,
once the contract has been signed.


125
00:14:58,015 --> 00:14:59,970


126
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,893


127
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:07,010


128
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,687


129
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,003
Please. Whatever you want

130
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,364
I'll give it.

131
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:08,715
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
thank you for your patience.

132
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,116
In a few minutes will get a
statement from, Mr Klimitov.

133
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,722
Thank you.

134
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:22,156


135
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,993
- Tell me some good news.
- Keep watching.

136
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:32,113
Mr. Klimitov should be exiting
the theatre any moment now.

137
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,793
We should have a
statement, for you shortly.

138
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:37,479
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Something...

139
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:42,033
He's bleeding, what appears
to be from his neck.

140
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:46,032
Chaos. There's total
chaos here at Vladivostok.

141
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,559
Yuri Klimitov,
a Russian oil mogul,

142
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,797
appears to be injured.

143
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,356
As promised, no more merger.

144
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,717
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Yes, cheers!

145
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,076
Greetings friends and honoured
guests from abroad.

146
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:21,935
It is a day... we recognise

147
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,470
by displaying a highest honour,

148
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,228
a sacred treasure...

149
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,554
of our ninja ancestry...

150
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,353
The Yoroi Bitsu.

151
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:34,553
After 30 years as Soke,

152
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:38,232
I must now, name a successor.

153
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:43,312


154
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:00,630


155
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,789


156
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,190


157
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,469


158
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,909


159
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,308


160
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,909


161
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,304


162
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,379


163
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,780


164
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:02,183


165
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:04,982


166
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:09,576


167
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,502


168
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,456
The Yoroi Bitsu must be taken

169
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,702
to the other side of the world.

170
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,856
To be guarded.
Hidden from sight.

171
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:23,303
There is a man, a scholar,
the only person I trust,

172
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:25,541
to keep it's power
from falling into

173
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,940
the hands of Masazuka.

174
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:37,221


175
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:42,018
Sensei.

176
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,336


177
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:49,655


178
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:16,606


179
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,575


180
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,894


181
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,094
Namiko,

182
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,253


183
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:29,014


184
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,893


185
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:37,010


186
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:55,768


187
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,810
You see, the Dean is
a close personal friend.

188
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:00,410
Considering the safety we need,

189
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:02,888
I thought it wise to store
it in the university vault.

190
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,809
This way.

191
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:55,523


192
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,122
So tell me, Casey,

193
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,203
How does a young
man like yourself...

194
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,561
- end up in a Japanese Dojo?
- You mean a white guy?

195
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:13,285
Well you don't exactly
fit the demographic profile.

196
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:18,241
Well, okay.

197
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:21,280
My father was a marine.

198
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:23,275
He was stationed in Okinawa,

199
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,361
so me and my mother,
moved there with him.

200
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,600
But they didn't get along to well.

201
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,760
She ended up leaving.

202
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:32,520
The problem was...

203
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:35,356
- She didn't take me with her.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

204
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:37,759
You see, my dad, uh...

205
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:41,159
He was a drunk.

206
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,398
I guess she couldn't take it any more,

207
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:45,997
He finally drank himself of the end
of a cliff in a car, when I was twelve..

208
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:51,036
So anyway a friend of the
family took me to see Sensei

209
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,237
rather than let them
ship me off to an orphanage

210
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,677
and... that's
where I stayed.

211
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,517
I haven't looked back since.

212
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,701
Masazuka.

213
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:28,732


214
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:36,499


215
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,698


216
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:41,379


217
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380


218
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:52,171


219
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:46,366


220
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:50,810


221
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:53,171


222
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,090


223
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,725


224
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,689


225
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:19,168


226
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,727


227
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:24,327


228
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,318


229
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,280


230
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,486


231
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,005


232
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:45,645


233
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:20,683


234
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:29,357
I remember the day I met
Takada Sensei in Japan.

235
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,599
His technical skills were amazing.

236
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,997
Well I hope we
can just close the deal.

237
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:00,071
Press is already here.
I'll get back to you.

238
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,833
Mr. Temple, what is your reaction
to the pipeline murders in Russia?

239
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,236
It's a tragedy.

240
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,316
Isn't it true that Temple Oil shares
are up by 20 percent since,

241
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,310
that deal fell through?

242
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,395
So is the stock market.

243
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,634
Is there a correlation to that to?

244
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:15,755
But they were your competitors...

245
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,997
These were well respected men and
their deaths are a threat to all of us.

246
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,356
I'm willing to pledge
10 million dollars...

247
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,274
to anyone who can
bring in these killers.

248
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:27,713
What about the police
sources who say this is another


249
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:30,749
In a chain of killings involving
an organization called "The Ring".

250
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:35,065
I can't comment on something
I'm not familiar with.

251
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:37,632
Isn't it true, your company
has benefited each time.

252
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:40,111
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

253
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:45,268
A friend? Didn't expect
to hear from you.

254
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:48,310
Always a pleasure
doing business with you.

255
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:53,703
Now, I must ask you
to do a job for me.

256
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,971
Namiko, did you
try your father again?

257
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,589
Still no answer.

258
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:03,829
He should be there.

259
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:07,468
I... Don't understand.

260
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:22,622


261
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:40,865
- You looking for Rebecca?
- Yes.

262
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:44,345
Are you her friend?

263
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,544
Sort of, she, uh...

264
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:48,784
She knew my parents.

265
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,304
She had a stroke.

266
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,299
She past away a few months ago.

267
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:56,781
I'm sorry.

268
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,782
Ah, Casey. Good to see you back.

269
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:14,936
Afraid, I'm just
on my way to bed.

270
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:18,583
Namiko's is still up.
I'll see you in the morning.

271
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,936
- Okay. Good night, Professor.
- Good night.

272
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:31,739
Did you find her?

273
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:39,099
I guess she's been
sick for a while.

274
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,655
Who's there?

275
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:05,491
Get down!

276
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:53,649
You know why I'm here.
Where's the box?

277
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,926
Are you okay?

278
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,805
Come on.

279
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,284
Go!

280
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:05,765


281
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:08,201


282
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:10,442


283
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,561


284
00:35:57,994 --> 00:35:59,949
We need a room.

285
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,388
- Time's up!
- Give me five more minutes!

286
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:11,351


287
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:17,507
What?

288
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,621
Please.

289
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,706
Let's get you warm.

290
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,296
Rui... Akira...

291
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:44,104
- Professor.
- I know, I know.

292
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:48,138
You heard what they wanted.

293
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,424
- Masazuka.
- Yeah.

294
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,703
If he knows where we are...

295
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,982
That means my father...

296
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:00,982
No, no. We don't
know that yet.

297
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:04,782
Listen to me. We
don't know that yet.

298
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:17,501
The victim is Dr Paul Garrison,

299
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:19,495
He was a professor, author,

300
00:37:19,664 --> 00:37:22,053
lecturer, specialist
on the far east.

301
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:24,419
We got any suspects?

302
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,575
Oh, yeah.

303
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:29,380
One, Namiko Takeda...

304
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:31,659
and Casey Bowman.

305
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:37,378
Still no answer.

306
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:41,137
We just keep trying.

307
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,217
Although we no
official confirmation...

308
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:49,020
sources tell us, it was
a gang-land style hit.

309
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:50,939
Witnesses claim

310
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,199
there were several victims,
including the professor.

311
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,416
Can we go to the police?

312
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,683
Police are searching for two suspects,

313
00:37:56,684 --> 00:37:58,056
who were seen fleeing the scene.

314
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,395
A male
Caucasian, a female Asian

315
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:01,181


316
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:02,900
reportedly in their mid-twenties,

317
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,215
and are considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

318
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:08,849
We have to tell
them about, Masazuka.

319
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:10,930
He wasn't even there.

320
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,054
And people are dead.
The police... no.

321
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:16,534
They could hold on
to us, for a long time.

322
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:20,491
You heard Garrison. The Dean
knows we put something in that safe.

323
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:23,493
Pretty soon, somebody's
gonna make a connection.

324
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,055
- So?
- We have to move the Yoroi Bitsu.

325
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:30,972
Tomorrow.

326
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:35,131
It's okay.

327
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:38,012
We'll get through this.

328
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:53,249
Namiko?

329
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:56,730
Namiko?

330
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:05,848
The girl I was with,
have you seen her?

331
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:10,128
Two coffee's please
and two sandwiches.

332
00:39:10,212 --> 00:39:12,167
Okay.

333
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,526
Hey, what are you doing?

334
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,885
Getting us some food.

335
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:38,004
- Sandwiches are coming up.
- Thank you.

336
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:48,243
Let me get you some sugar.

337
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:11,361
Down!

338
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:19,400
Don't shoot us!

339
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,832
- Come on!
- Remember. We need her alive.

340
00:41:16,277 --> 00:41:18,234
Subway!

341
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:29,947
Subway.

342
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:42,790
Hey, excuse me!

343
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,823
Masazuka.

344
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:52,778
They could be
working for him.

345
00:43:05,746 --> 00:43:07,736
Come on.

346
00:45:43,008 --> 00:45:44,963
Police! Hands up!

347
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,284
Put your hands on your head!

348
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:57,965
Masazuka.

349
00:45:58,246 --> 00:46:01,885
You have, what
I asked for, or not?

350
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,761
Tell our colleague,
what happened.

351
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,359
We found them, but
they didn't have the box.

352
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,675
- Where are they?
- The police arrested them.

353
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:14,960
I asked...

354
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:17,920
Where?

355
00:46:18,804 --> 00:46:20,759
West 54 precinct.

356
00:46:21,003 --> 00:46:22,960
But there's no way
we can get to them.

357
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:38,717
Pray I find them...

358
00:46:38,801 --> 00:46:40,713
Or your next.

359
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,196
What are you doing in this country?

360
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,515
I was visiting a friend.

361
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,511
- The dead professor?
- Yes.

362
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:01,435
Why'd you kill him?

363
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,748
- I didn't.
- Then why'd you run?

364
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:06,508
Because we had to.
Those men wanted to kill us!

365
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:10,274
- Really?
- Hmm.

366
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:15,314
You have no idea what
you're dealing with here.

367
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,712
I'm all ears.

368
00:47:46,314 --> 00:47:48,270
Sir, can I help you?

369
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:50,988
I'm here for, Namiko Takeda.
She was arrested earlier today.

370
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:53,669
- I'm her attorney.
- Okay, send him in.

371
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:55,709
I'll meet him
in my office.

372
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:02,984
- Your lawyer just showed up.
- My lawyer?

373
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,306
That's quite a story, Casey.

374
00:48:24,189 --> 00:48:26,145
So, your saying that
this Masazuka guy,

375
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,705
who nobody's
seen or heard of.

376
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:30,785
or who may have heard,
is on your trail

377
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:32,984
is after you to...
retrieve a box?

378
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:35,505
The Yoroi Bitsu.

379
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,784
Right.

380
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:40,824
So where is it?

381
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:43,543
I can't tell you that.

382
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:48,863
Why not?

383
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,935
It's him. Masazuka, he's here.

384
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,941
I'll send him your regards.

385
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:08,981
Hey, don't leave me like this.
Hey!

386
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:13,935
Hey, what's going on?

387
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,976
Jesus Christ, lady. We're just
trying to get you out of here.

388
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,737
God! Let's go.

389
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,656
Let's go.

390
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:45,010
Hey, hey lady!

391
00:52:08,204 --> 00:52:10,161


392
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,436
- On the ground!
- Where is she?

393
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,235
I said get on the ground!

394
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,229
What do you think
is happening here?

395
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:03,355
Get down, or I'll
put you down.

396
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,946
Some fairy tale, huh?

397
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,899
- Just let her go.
- Not before I kill you.

398
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,617
No!

399
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:13,090


400
00:56:59,572 --> 00:57:01,528


401
00:57:05,372 --> 00:57:07,327


402
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,967


403
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,246


404
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,605


405
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,641


406
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:28,085


407
00:57:34,568 --> 00:57:36,724


408
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:39,083


409
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:52,402


410
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:55,482


411
00:57:56,365 --> 00:57:58,322


412
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,681


413
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,956
Where is she?

414
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,356
Who did you call, your source?

415
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,596
Nobody.

416
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:51,708
- Who did you call?
- It's just a number to keep in contact!

417
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,395
I don't know who's
on the other end!

418
00:58:54,919 --> 00:58:56,910
Wait! Wait!

419
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,034
I'll tell you where you
can find him, okay?

420
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:01,667
I'm listening.

421
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,630


422
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:16,910
Welcome... brothers.

423
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:35,031
We control the life and
blood of this planet.

424
00:59:35,794 --> 00:59:37,786
A dedicated "Ring of Brothers".

425
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:44,349
Kill him!

426
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,068
Come on, stop him!

427
01:02:13,137 --> 01:02:16,333


428
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:37,170


429
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,410


430
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:54,489
- Masazuka.
- Casey?

431
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,768
Where is she?

432
01:02:59,092 --> 01:03:01,047
Very close.

433
01:03:03,532 --> 01:03:05,487
If you've hurt her,
I swear to God...

434
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:07,607
Listen to me.

435
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,567
I want the Yoroi Bitsu.

436
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,686
Okay. You'll get it...

437
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,806
for Namiko.

438
01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:20,209
Construction site of 49th
and church at 3am.

439
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,243


440
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:54,475


441
01:03:56,046 --> 01:03:57,524


442
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:55,954
How many more of you?

443
01:04:56,198 --> 01:04:58,155
Two.

444
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:02,269
I'm sorry, guys.

445
01:05:03,558 --> 01:05:05,513
Freeze!

446
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,188
Is that the box?

447
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:14,032
You should believe me now.

448
01:05:14,676 --> 01:05:16,668
Let's take a ride down town.

449
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:19,431
No. I'm gonna give
you what you want.

450
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:23,111
You're gonna let me do,
what I have to do.

451
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:31,664
Masazuka! Let her go!

452
01:06:32,748 --> 01:06:34,738
Not until I get the Yoroi Bitsu.

453
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:37,024
Don't, Casey!

454
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,423
It's all yours.

455
01:06:46,547 --> 01:06:48,502
Now, let her go.

456
01:07:19,822 --> 01:07:22,779
49th and church.
Masazuka and Casey.

457
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:24,098
I want them both dead.

458
01:07:25,222 --> 01:07:27,178
What you have, is mine.

459
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:31,498
So, come and get it.

460
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:47,888
Go! Go!

461
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,557
Get down!

462
01:11:14,117 --> 01:11:16,072
You need this,

463
01:11:16,156 --> 01:11:18,112
to keep her alive.

464
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:27,744
No!

465
01:12:43,587 --> 01:12:45,542
Yes.

466
01:12:47,426 --> 01:12:49,381
Such anger.

467
01:12:57,744 --> 01:13:00,700
This the police,
drop your weapons.

468
01:13:01,105 --> 01:13:02,823
Put your hands in the air
and lay down on the ground.

469
01:13:14,943 --> 01:13:16,898
Again, drop your weapons.

470
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:19,817
Put your hands in the air
and lay down on the ground.

471
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:32,490
Namiko.

472
01:14:33,734 --> 01:14:35,690
Namiko.

473
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:40,991
I'm sorry.

474
01:14:44,992 --> 01:14:46,992
I can't save you.

475
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:55,693
I love you!

476
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,194
I've always loved you.

477
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:08,795
Tradition says...

478
01:15:09,696 --> 01:15:14,496
that the Shinobu Katana Sword
possesses both, the power to take life

479
01:15:15,097 --> 01:15:18,197
and also the life's spirit,
the power to heal.

480
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:22,508
The power to heal.

481
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,159
Namiko. Drink.

482
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:48,914
Drink.

483
01:15:58,027 --> 01:15:59,980
Come back to me.

484
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,496
Namiko.

485
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,977
This is one hell of
a mess here, Casey.

486
01:18:05,665 --> 01:18:07,618
It's gonna take day's... hell,

487
01:18:07,822 --> 01:18:09,776
maybe even weeks
to clean this up.

488
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:11,853
Not that it really
matters anymore, does it?

489
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:16,127
The main thing is,
"The Ring's" broken.

490
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:18,285
Temple's in custody.

491
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:20,562
Then there's you two...

492
01:18:22,963 --> 01:18:24,951
Your late for your plane.

493
01:18:26,558 --> 01:18:29,023
Now get the hell out
of here, permanently.
