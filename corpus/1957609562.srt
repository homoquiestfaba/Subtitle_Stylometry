00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:14,775
Hello everybody

My name is Abdeen

3
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:18,256

4
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:21,727
Everything is fine to me

5
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:24,296
And it will always be beautiful...

6
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:27,365
I hope you'll keep looking down

7
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:31,403
This is my first time on TV

8
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:35,240
If you want to know how I act

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,973
Then please keep watching

10
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:40,978
All right

11
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:45,751
The show is on!

12
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:49,983
Title: Slaughtered Vomit Dolls (2006)
aka: Vomit Gore 1 <Slaughter>

13
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:03,323
Will you do anything for me?

14
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:06,903
Um

15
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:11,298
- are you willing to say anything I say?
- I will do whatever you want

16
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:19,951
willing to die for you

17
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,112
Murder for you

18
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,243
This is my little yard

19
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:21,439
please, please

20
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,908
do not do that

21
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:24,432
please don't do this

22
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:46,728
I was insulted by a priest

23
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,135
Wish he went to hell

24
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:52,470
Wish this never happened

25
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,598
- help , help - i'm fucked

26
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:57,709
so painful

27
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,371
I can't forget all that

28
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,978
because it hurts so much...

29
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:10,344
It hurts to the bone

30
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,492
I used to trust him so much

31
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:16,594
But he's stubborn...

32
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,464
God, save me

33
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,762
I really can't forget all that

34
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:27,772
I used to trust him so much

35
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,474
God save me

36
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:32,644
But I can't resist that temptation...

37
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:35,636
That was April 5, 1949

38
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:41,209
i can't forget

39
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,300
My name is Angela Abdeen

40
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,876

46
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,374
it's hell

47
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,739
It's a fairy experience

48
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:46,443
The devil in me drives me

49
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:51,923
drives me to have fun

50
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:55,825
make me want to die

51
00:05:56,594 --> 00:06:01,132
feeling of orgasm

52
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:03,623
make me irresistible

53
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:10,831
It's like a demon is holding on to me

54
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:15,602
Are you happy? !

55
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,638
Cool!

56
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,218
This is life

57
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:23,517
for this life

58
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,482
I swear

59
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:31,428
I swear to give my soul to Satan

60
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:35,732
hope he bless me

61
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:39,904
bless me for 13 years

62
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:44,136
After 13 years I will be dedicated to him

63
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,208
Dedicated to the so-called hell kingdom

64
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:53,251
I swore

65
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,453
my child

66
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:58,623
Come with me to sacrifice to Satan

67
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:01,893
I promise Satan will kill them

68
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:04,596
Damn Satan

69
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:08,199
Lord of all evil!

70
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,569
This is my home...

71
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,270
March 31, 1994 at Excel Theron Hotel

72
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:28,343
Look at my embarrassment

73
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:31,381
Oh my god

74
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,957
Can you do me a favor?

75
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,796
Can you help me?

76
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,291
Hold!

77
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,849
You know, I'm very expensive

78
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,092
Do you have money?

79
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,428
My price is very high

80
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,129
If you have no money...

81
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,864
you don't even want to sleep with me...

82
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:50,322
I am very expensive

83
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,122

Everybody look over there

87
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:19,931

88
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:22,024
That foal is mine

89
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,837
How am I doing?

90
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:28,806

149
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:54,845

150
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:57,712
just for the money...

151
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:02,052
For my money... I became a showgirl

152
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:04,821
Guys pay to go to bars to see me perform

153
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:08,257

154
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:12,396

155
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:14,455

159
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:41,458
I only care about money

160
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,554
Just give money

161
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,067
I do it every day

162
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,297
People only give money to dance

163
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,941
I only have feelings for you

164
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,239
I don't care who is looking for me

165
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,246
Nobody can find me

166
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:05,942
I don't care. I don't like people finding me

167
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:11,851
Look, I made it myself

168
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,859
I didn't know you just...

169
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:26,796
How about me?

170
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,982
Oh

171
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:49,291
Oh

172
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,921
Because I don't...

173
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:58,031
feel like... don't belong here

174
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:04,098
Maybe he's been hurt a lot before.

175
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,540
That's when I was a kid

176
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,668
I'm very good in bed

177
00:30:10,814 --> 00:30:13,016
How do you want me to serve you tonight?

178
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:17,087
Anyway, do what you want

179
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,749
I don't know what I am...

180
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:37,807
i don't care

181
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:41,834
i don't care about anything

182
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,786
I want…

183
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:52,880
want to be a big star

184
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:58,461
I want everyone to see me on TV

185
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:01,565
Better than a Hollywood star!

186
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:03,465
I don't care about anyone

187
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,072
13 years old

188
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:13,143
I burned our church down there

189
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:15,245
a fire

190
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:16,913
Later I...

191
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:18,615
I ran away from home

192
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:22,185
He raped me the day before

193
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:24,988
I was still a virgin

194
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:30,827
I started selling myself so I could have money to go to school

195
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:34,864
I always wanted to grow up

196
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:35,899
be a cinderella

197
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:38,333
But I became a showgirl

198
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:41,658
huh... huh

199
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:42,892
uh... uh...

200
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:44,655
Nas, blah blah blah...

201
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:46,025
Nas Pata

202
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,189
Whether you believe it or not

203
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:16,852
Before I was 13, I had big dreams

204
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:20,864
much bigger than now

205
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:23,933
have to face them

206
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:27,070
I have to whet the appetite of the spectators

207
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,267
Those guys like to be sexy

208
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,444
I was drunk once

209
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,846
On stage

210
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,438
I am dancing...

211
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:56,593
he did a lot of bad things

212
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:59,558
I just quit drinking

213
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:02,130
That's why I drink

214
00:35:03,473 --> 00:35:06,909
Because I like being drunk

215
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,358
i had a nightmare

216
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,054
it's about a girl of mine

217
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,462
I'm doing it now in Texas

218
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:06,366
far from home

219
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:11,407
Texans are cool

220
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:15,678
straight eyes

221
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:19,449
Texas is such a weird place

222
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,452
People are very generous

223
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:31,451
Believe it, they love blowjobs make me feel like throwing up

224
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:34,664
So I deliberately let myself vomit

225
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:38,828
I made myself nauseous afterwards

226
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:49,812
But then again

227
00:36:49,812 --> 00:36:51,814
I still think Texans are better

228
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:55,618
There is. just disgusting

229
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:59,022
I even use my own fingers

230
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:03,092
to adjust your throat

231
00:37:03,092 --> 00:37:07,085
Digging my fingers deep into my throat...

232
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:11,034
It feels very strange, you know?

233
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:15,505
But only if you practice

234
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:19,742
Look, put it in your mouth like this

235
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:22,578
very very disgusting

236
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:27,417
[died on March 3rd, 1994 in Queens, New York] Must put your finger on this part...

237
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:31,478
Sometimes the hand touches the teeth

238
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:35,614
have. Do you feel like dying?

239
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,528
I break my mouth sometimes

240
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:40,129
But you have to practice

241
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:44,300
Because those disgusting Texans like to put their ass on your face

242
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,734
very very disgusting

243
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,398
I have it later. I vomited blood...

244
00:37:57,213 --> 00:38:01,081
I still vomit when I get home...

245
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:22,725
Horrible

246
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:24,590

262
00:49:03,846 --> 00:49:05,748

263
00:49:05,748 --> 00:49:07,739
Willing to kill for you

264

265

266
00:53:31,847 --> 00:53:33,576
I just go to bed

267
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:26,500
I can't bear to watch it

268
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:30,396
It's still pretty though, isn't it?

269
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:35,443
I burned our church down there

270
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:37,343
a fire

271
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:39,080
Later I...

272
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,149
I can't dance at home anymore...

273
00:59:41,149 --> 00:59:43,151
I've been on the road of no return

274
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:45,086
Dancing at night

275
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:48,055
Standing on the street during the day…

276
00:59:50,025 --> 00:59:52,661
I don't care about anyone, I don't care about anyone

277
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:55,230
It makes me feel sick

278
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,831

279
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,633

He shoved the bottle into my body and he saw blood

284
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,780
Since I was a virgin at the time he continued...

285
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,483

286
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:18,453

287
01:00:18,453 --> 01:00:20,488

289
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:24,225
