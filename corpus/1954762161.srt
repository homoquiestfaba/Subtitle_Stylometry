00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,381
Hi, I'm Jim Capobianco.

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,591
I wrote and directed
Your Friend the Rat.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,010
And I'm Nate Wragg.

4
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,930
I'm the production designer
of Your Friend the Rat.

5
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:21,896
So the idea of the film came
while I was working on the feature,

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,691
way back in 2000.

7
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,193
'Cause we always do all this
tons of research on our films,

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,278
and I thought, "Wow, wouldn't it be neat

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,115
"to actually use some of this
in the short?"

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,952
You know, a lot of people at Pixar
have come from 2D,

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,622
myself included, and love the form.

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:45,169
And it was a great opportunity
for a lot of animators to do 2D again.

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,381
And so many people just embraced it.

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,177
And, unfortunately, we couldn't utilize
all the animators at Pixar who do 2D,

15
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,721
or even wanted to try it,

16
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,725
but we were able to get a good group
together to handle it,

17
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,852
and they all just had a blast,

18
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,020
and I had a blast working with them
to do this.

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,945
And some of them had never even
animated in this style of 2D before.

20
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:16,284
The look of it came out
of the old Disney '50s educational films

21
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,413
that were done by Ward Kimball
and others at the studio,

22
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:25,752
and one of the driving forces behind it
to emulate those films a little bit.

23
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,547
But it was really economical to do,

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,176
and I thought that would be neat
to do the short in that style.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,430
I think we were really trying
to find our own voice within that,

26
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,599
using that as a jumping-off point.

27
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,605
And, actually, the thing I found
working on this

28
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,274
was how do you
make these sort of dry. . .

29
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,609
Some of these facts can be kind of dry,

30
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,861
how do you make them entertaining
and fun?

31
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,198
And one of the challenges
of putting the film together

32
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:59,160
was trying to think of
what is a funny way

33
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,621
to get this information across,

34
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,290
and in a succinct amount
of time as well.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,754
But always add that little flourish to it,

36
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,799
'cause that's actually what was
wonderful about the Ward Kimball stuff,

37
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:17,261
is that no matter how limited it was,
or stylized,

38
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:22,016
he would always add this little touch
of full animation on ones,

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,562
little flourish and it would
just bring that much life to it.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,321
Yeah, in a lot of ways, the animation. . .
You're spending just as much time on it.

41
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,742
You're just pinpointing what areas
you want to animate.

42
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:44,080
And I think probably the best example
of it in the cartoon is

43
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,541
in this section, right here,
with the Black Death.

44
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:52,004
We have just a simple drawing
of Linguini, looking kind of funny,

45
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,883
he falls over, and just his legs
do this crazy little bit of animation.

46
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:01,138
But just having those legs be in there
and doing that fun little bit of animation

47
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,475
really sells the whole idea
that he's dead,

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,687
but his legs are still
kicking around a little bit.

49
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,397
That little final bug kick.

50
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,067
That's one thing that was kind
of exciting about this short,

51
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:18,364
was all the history and everything
that goes into this cartoon

52
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,576
is handled in a really funny way,
and isn't really taken that serious.

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,332
You're really trying to find, "What's
the caricature of the moment?

54
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,128
"What's the gag
you're trying to get across,

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,463
"and how do you caricature it
the best way?"

56
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:39,260
Awesome styling of the Chinese zodiac

57
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,598
by Teddy Newton, Nate
and Scott Morse.

58
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,644
One thing that was exciting, for me,
coming onto this project,

59
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,062
was with all the. . .

60
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,523
The short is basically broken down
into three sections,

61
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,984
and the first section
is the history section,

62
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,906
and Jim really wanted to capture
each time period

63
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,617
in the shot that we had.

64
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:07,288
So, for example, if we have a shot
that dates back into the Roman era,

65
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,917
or in the black plague era,

66
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,753
I was asked to start referencing artwork,

67
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,631
and basically the way people created
art back in those times,

68
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,301
and try and style it up a little bit.

69
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,346
So that it had a neat,
sort of, funny flair to it,

70
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,725
but it also felt true to how
they designed stuff back then.

71
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,227
Right, like the Revolution section,

72
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,522
we wanted to get a real woodblock
look for it,

73
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,441
and even the way the animation
was styled

74
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,903
was to have a very staccato
kind of feel to it.

75
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:43,115
And, actually,
if you went frame by frame,

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,159
through that section where
the rat hits the other rat,

77
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,203
you'd see this one gigantic hand.

78
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,790
Yeah, that's one thing that's really
exciting about the 2D animation.

79
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,708
There's different ways that you do it.

80
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,336
You would handle it differently
than in CG.

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,339
You know, CG, everything is
kind of spelled out for you

82
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,258
in the way you have to do it
with the computer programs,

83
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,345
but in 2D,
it's really more artistically free.

84
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,347
The stop-motion shot,

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,394
I just went, "What if we did that
globe shot in stop-motion?"

86
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,896
And then it just felt like it would fit

87
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,149
the sort of educational aspect
of the film.

88
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,402
One of the things about
stop-motion, though,

89
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,195
is it's just. . . You have one shot at it,

90
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,740
-unlike everything else.
-Well, just like they used to.

91
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:30,913
The video game section that we had,
we could have tried to draw something

92
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,540
that felt like Canada,

93
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,418
but, instead, Jim had this great idea
that it would be a video game,

94
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,879
so we handled it
like an 8-bit video game,

95
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,507
and it still felt like Canada,

96
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
but it was really cheesy
and silly at the same time.

97
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,264
I want to talk about the music a little bit.
The music incorporates really well.

98
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,642
One of the things I wanted to do,
like in the old '50s animation,

99
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,937
was to have the music written
early enough

100
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,605
that we could actually animate to it,

101
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,693
and it could actually inspire us
and be really integrated within the story,

102
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,530
and so having Alex Mandel do that,
it really, I think, accomplished that.

103
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,163
This is wonderful collage art
from Teddy Newton for this section.

104
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,709
Just bits and pieces from everywhere.
I don't know where he gets it all.

105
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,544
Different magazines
and photographs and stuff,

106
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,588
and he just puts it all together.

107
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,593
Yeah, it sort of makes you really
believe each one of the materials

108
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,887
that Emile's chewing through.

109
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,890
It definitely feels like
there's a door, there's a pipe,

110
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,059
there's some cinder blocks.

111
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,563
And people should just step through
this animation, this 2D animation,

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,358
it's just some really funny drawings
within this.

113
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,736
And you don't really see it going by,
you just feel it,

114
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,238
but the guys did such an amazing job.

115
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,869
I think with this style of 2D, too,
you get this. . .

116
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,121
It's really based on the design.

117
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:58,459
The look of it is what speaks more
than, say, the acting,

118
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,797
or you're not really trying to incorporate
the illusion of life.

119
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:09,845
I think this shot coming up here,
right after the atomic explosion,

120
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,098
was one of the first bits of animation,

121
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,726
and I think Bob Scott did it,
and it really set the tone. . .

122
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,894
It did, yeah.

123
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,646
. . .for how everything was going
to be animated.

124
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,107
Actually, he did both of these,
one after the other, didn't he?

125
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,067
Yeah, I think he did them both in,
like, a week,

126
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,903
and I remember we showed it at dailies,

127
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,323
and everyone was just like, "I get it!"

128
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,369
Yeah, one of the difficulties we had
with the animators

129
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,830
was trying to get them
to not do so much animation.

130
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:42,211
To pull them back and to do a little less
with this stylized way.

131
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,341
I couldn't even believe how fast
they animated a lot of this stuff.

132
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,468
-I know, it went really quickly.
-They just were, like. . .

133
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:56,058
We just passed our very
scientific-looking illustrations there.

134
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,727
They're not labeled,
I thought I should tell everybody,

135
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:03,732
it's Louis Pasteur, Gertrude Elion
and Jonas Salk.

136
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,901
The three scientists there.

137
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,240
And here we come.
This is the one shot in the whole film

138
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,326
that's integrated
all our styles of animation.

139
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:20,583
We have after effects,
we have 2D, stop-motion,

140
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,628
all within the same. . .
And computer, CG, all in the same shot.

141
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,047
This was all done by Nate Wragg.

142
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,217
He cleaned up the animation
that was done in 2D,

143
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,636
and we projected it on a chalkboard.

144
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,141
Yeah, that was really cool because
Sarah animated everything by hand,

145
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,687
and then we, frame by frame,
projected it onto a large chalkboard,

146
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:46,025
and I spent the day tracing it,
drawing by drawing, with chalk.

147
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:50,029
And it goes by really quick.

148
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:54,366
It's probably about six seconds,
but it took about six hours, I think.

149
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,042
The song came out of. . .

150
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,795
When I was developing this, I was like,
"Well, it's an educational film,"

151
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,340
I want it to have a song in it.

152
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,467
Kind of like Schoolhouse Rock.

153
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,596
That was done in the '70s,
that we grew up on.

154
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,643
My good friend, James Dashe,
I asked him. . .

155
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:26,398
James is a Mac administrator here
at Pixar, but a piano composer,

156
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:31,403
and I said, "Hey, let's do a song.
I don't know if they'll go for it,

157
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,324
"but let's just try it." And we sat down
and both wrote this song,

158
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,285
and we wanted it to have a rough feel,

159
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,413
and neither of us having written
an actual song before,

160
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,706
it sort of has that.

161
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:48,087
And also Patton and Pete,
not really being professional singers,

162
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,675
it also has that feel of two guys
coming together to sing a song.

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,179
And it kind of all came together.

164
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,597
It was one of those Hail Mary shots

165
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,975
where I was like, "I don't know
if this is going to work,

166
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,727
"but let's just try it. Let's just go for it."
And it did.

167
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,523
The ending,

168
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,111
I love this sort of integration
of CG and the 2D playing.

169
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,282
It kind of pulls together the two ideas
we're playing with a lot in the film,

170
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,368
with the three-dimensional
and two-dimensional.

171
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,539
And then the idea to play with text,
that graphic, everything,

172
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
and it's just something I don't think
we've ever done here at the studio,

173
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,837
where we've integrated this way and
kind of went with this very broad humor,

174
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:35,968
the Tex Avery kind of style
of cartooning.

175
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,639
So, well, that's the end, and I hope
everybody enjoyed the commentary.

176
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,143
And it was a joy to make this short,

177
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,730
and I had so much fun working with
all these people you see right here,

178
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:53,152
and the truly talented group, and I hope
to work with all of them again someday.

179
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,778
Especially this guy sitting next to me.

180
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,989
Yeah, I mean,
hopefully we'll get to do this again.

181
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,949
It was a blast for me.

182
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,163
A great opportunity to just really get
to explore all the fun ideas

183
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,916
in the cartoon
and try and put some art to them.

184
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,545
All right, thank you.
