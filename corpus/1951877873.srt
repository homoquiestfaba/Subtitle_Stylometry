1
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Hot as hell out there, huh?

2
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,240
Well, well, well, well.

3
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,560
How are we today, young man?
What can I do you for?

4
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,760
Jeez, it must be cosy in that suit. Hey?

5
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,800
Oh. Yeah.
No, the airport lost all my bags.

6
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,880
Well, it's gonna be
a real scorcher today.

7
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
Yeah. No kidding.

8
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm supposed to catch
a boat cruise from here...?

9
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,960
A few years back you'd be lucky
to see any tourists up here at all.

10
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,560
- Yeah.
- Too remote for most people.

11
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,200
It's changing pretty quickly,
I can tell you.

12
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,160
Right. Uh, can I get a coffee, please?
Real strong.

13
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,880
- Two sugars.
- How about a 'cup-a-cino'?

14
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,348
Give the new machine a work-out.

15
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,120
Phil. Hey.

16
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,520
What's going on, man?

17
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,840
How's Chicago?

18
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,320
Everything's fine,

19
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,720
except for the fact that
they lost my bags at the airport

20
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,840
and my computer was in my bag
and I need it to finish the article,

21
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,000
so could you call Greg at the office
and tell him what happened

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,878
'cause I really need someone
to track down those bags for me.

23
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Hello? Hello?

24
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Hello? Can you hear me?

25
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
Can you hear me now? Phil?

26
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,600
- Get outta there.
- Can you hear me now?

27
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,880
Hey, can you hear me?
Hey. There you are.

28
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,680
No, no, the service here sucks.

29
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,840
Oh, no. Oh, no, it's over.
Yeah, she went back last week.

30
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,400
Whatever.

31
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,880
Why do you think I took this shitty job?

32
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,313
Hello?

33
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,793
Shit.

34
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,713
Jesus Christ.

35
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,920
There you go. Real strong.

36
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,000
It's on the house.

37
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,877
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

38
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,353
Hey, nice picture.

39
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,069
That silly bugger will think twice
about going swimming at night, hey?

40
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,997
- Tickets.
- Dad, have you got the tickets?

41
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,393
Tickets.

42
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,756
That's two. Two adults, one child.

43
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,600
Cheers. Just in the middle there.

44
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,480
Wow. It's so low.

45
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,994
Yeah. Big one looks safer.

46
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
- Better you than me.
- OK.

47
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,520
So one of the rules of my tour

48
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,720
is that you only have one chance
to complain about the heat and the flies.

49
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,280
Nice to meet ya.

50
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,840
They're a fact of life up here

51
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,440
and whingeing about 'em all day
isn't gonna make 'em disappear.

52
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
Simon. Get a hold of those flies.

53
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,271
Might have to kick you off the boat, mate.

54
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,200
Ticket?

55
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,952
Oh, I got one. Trust me.

56
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,039
Come on, mate.

57
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,560
You got two tickets there, sir.

58
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
- Oh, no, no, no. Just me.
- No worries.

59
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,713
Sit anywhere you like.

60
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,680
Jesus!

61
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,514
We're on bush time now, so should
have youse back around 5:00. Or 6:00.

62
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,988
She's your kid,
and you kind of promised her crocodiles.

63
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Honey, it's a two-hour tape.

64
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,914
I'll get footage, OK?

65
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,432
Oh! Here we go.

66
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Maybe we'll see those crocodiles.

67
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
Welcome to Ryan's Wildlife Cruises.

68
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
My name's Kate Ryan

69
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,880
and I'm gonna be your tour guide today,

70
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,600
in case you hadn't figured that out.

71
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,160
This is my business partner, Kevin.

72
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,920
Say g'day, Kev.

73
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,229
Yes, you are.
Oh, my God, you're so cute.

74
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
Honey, we should get a dog.

75
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,000
Thought you were a cat person.

77
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,831
Anyone have any questions?

78
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,515
Alright, let's go check out some crocs.

79
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,480
The Northern Territory
is home to the biggest population

80
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,440
of saltwater crocodiles in the world,

81
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,557
spread throughout
several large tidal river systems.

82
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,760
The State covers a landmass
double the size of Texas

83
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,480
but we have a population
of only 200,000 people.

84
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,680
As you can imagine,
we all have pretty big backyards.

85
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,200
Excuse me. Excuse me?

86
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,840
- Hi there.
- Hi. I'm Gwen.

87
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,080
Hi. Hi, Gwen. Would you mind...?

88
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
- Oh, no. Sure, help yourself.
- No, no.

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
Sorry, it's, um...

90
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,880
It's the smoke. It's... it's kind of wafting.

91
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,520
Right. Shite. OK. Story of my life!

92
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,040
I'll, um, go down the back.

93
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,920
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.
- That's OK.

94
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,433
- Really appreciate that.
- Thanks a lot.

95
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,958
Right.

96
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,520
- Come here.
- Where's the zoom on this?

97
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,480
- You don't need the zoom.
- There it is, there.

98
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Come on, darling.

99
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,754
OK. Smile.

100
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,440
- Hmm.
- Oh, Sher.

101
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,080
- What are you doing? Look at that.
- Oh, darling. Don't pull a face.

102
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
- Why do you always pull a face?
- Excuse me?

103
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,400
Do you want me to take
a photo of the family?

104
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,240
- Yeah, that...that'd be super.
- Yeah?

105
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,160
- That would be good. Thank you.
- Thanks very much.

106
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,752
- The big button?
- Yeah, just that one there.

107
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,598
OK. Here we go.

108
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,440
Oh, that's beaut.

109
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,280
- That is a beautiful camera.
- Thank you.

110
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,800
- Yeah, is that new?
- Oh, yes.

111
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
- I got it for Christmas.
- Yeah, nice. Cute little snapper.

112
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,920
I mean, she's no, um...digital SLR,

113
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,680
which is single lens reflex.

114
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,080
I got a 25mm lens. I got a 35mm,
right through to a 1 55mm.

115
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,120
Doubler pushes it out to 300mm,
but who's counting?

116
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,880
- I know I'm not.
- Well, that's very impressive.

117
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,480
It is indeed. Guess how much.

118
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,120
Man, it's like,
you know, the 'African Queen'.

119
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,640
It's hot and horny
and I just wanna get naked.

120
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
I could come into the room.

121
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,160
- You know, we could do that.
- Do you want to sit somewhere else?

122
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,960
- I like sitting next to you.
- No. Do you want to sit there?

123
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,640
- No.
- There's a spare seat. Sit there.

124
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,640
- I paid for this seat.
- You're bugging me. Sit there.

125
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
- What, with the lrish girl?
- Really, no, it's sexual harassment.

126
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,280
- With the lrish girl?
- No, just sit here.

127
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,560
You can't make everybody
move to the back of the boat.

128
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,040
- No.
- Enough already with the sex talk.

129
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,996
- OK? OK? OK?
- It's not your boat.

130
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,193
Shite! It's hot, isn't it?

131
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
Hey, what are they waiting for?

132
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,277
Keep watching.

133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,960
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh!

134
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,760
- What was that?
- You right there, love?

135
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,274
Look at the size of the bastard.

136
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't you worry.
He's already got his lunch.

137
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,400
God, that's amazing.

138
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,920
- Are you right?
- How often does it do that?

139
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,240
Every day at 2:00.

140
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,600
- Wow. Every day at 2:00?
- Yep.

141
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,160
And how high do they jump?

142
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Oh, they can jump right out.
They use their tails to propel 'em.

143
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,080
I mean, sometimes
they come right up to you.

144
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,280
So, it could come into the boat, right?

145
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,040
It could come into the boat?

146
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,720
You'll be right,
so long as you don't go in the water.

147
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,676
I'm not planning on it, I tell you that.

148
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,400
There's a salty.

149
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,231
They're so still.

150
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,440
- Check this out.
- That's great. That's great!

151
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,880
Dad, imagine if it bit you.

152
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,040
It's amazing.

153
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,640
It's so still.

154
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,040
Looks young, though, doesn't it?
I guess that's how they catch...

155
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,473
Looks handsome.

156
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,760
Oh. There he goes.

157
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,200
Alright, the species
that we're looking at today,

158
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,680
the saltwater crocodile,

159
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,280
is probably the most dangerous member
of the crocodilian family.

160
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,400
They're pretty much living dinosaurs,

161
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,560
who have been perfecting
their hunting skills

162
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,920
over 200 million years.

163
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,440
So they can swim underwater
at up to 20 miles an hour

164
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,360
without making a ripple on the surface.

165
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,800
And they can burst out to attack
with incredible speed.

166
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,640
They're also known to watch their prey
and learn their habits.

167
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,440
In fact, you can see this bloke
looking at us now.

168
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,680
So if any of you are camping up here
near a river and you need water...

169
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,320
It's got teeth like your mother.

170
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,680
..make sure you do so
at a different time every day

171
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,750
because the croc will learn your routine.

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,640
You might wanna avoid that.

173
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,440
Croc gets a hold of you
and he can't swallow you in one go,

174
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,317
he will literally tear you to pieces.

175
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Super.

176
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,800
- Allen, can you imagine?
- So how big do they grow?

177
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Well, that one there was a little one,

178
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
but they can grow
from 20 to 25 feet long,

179
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
weigh up to two tonne.

180
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
There have been stories of bigger ones,

181
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,160
but the crocs that we're looking at today
are just as dangerous.

182
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,040
Are there many attacks on people?

183
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,600
Tourists, occasionally.

184
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,400
That was in poor taste.

185
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,880
I'll bet.

186
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Don't worry, ma'am.
We're perfectly safe on this boat.

187
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,200
They won't attack anything
bigger than they are.

188
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,270
- How big is this boat?
- Yeah.

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,480
- Big enough.
- Sure. Whatever.

190
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,400
Lighten up a little, will you?

191
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,039
Right. The bigger the better,
if you ask me.

192
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,840
Aren't you beautiful, hey?

193
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,120
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

194
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,678
Gimme a kiss. Gimme a kiss.

195
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,312
- Got a Wet One?
- Oh, yeah.

196
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
Jesus. Anyone complain
about the flies yet?

197
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,440
That was your one shot.

198
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,360
That wasn't a complaint.
That was a question.

199
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
- How long are you out here, anyway?
- Oh, just a few days.

200
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,880
Alice Springs after this, then home.

201
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,920
Where's that?

202
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,400
Chicago.

203
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm a travel writer for a magazine.

204
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
Sounds like the life.

205
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,477
How about you? You travel a lot?

206
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,033
Never left the Territory.

207
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,600
You're kidding, right?

208
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,318
Why would I wanna leave all this?

209
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,232
It's amazing watching people's faces
the first time they come out here.

210
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,080
You might wanna...take your seat.

211
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,638
Gets a bit hairy around this bend.

212
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,193
Aye, aye, captain.

213
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,520
Sher, did you know this is
the oldest landscape in the world?

214
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,000
Absolutely ancient.

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,116
Dad, you can be so boring sometimes.

216
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,720
MAN AND One, two...

217
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,030
I got you.

218
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,280
Did you see that?!

219
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,760
No.

220
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,671
Yee-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

221
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,512
Oh, my gosh. They're stopping.

222
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,480
Oooh!

223
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,152
Keep your shirt on, cunt-face.

224
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,240
- Katie.
- G'day, Neil.

225
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,880
Oi.

226
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,760
Bloody charming. There's ladies present.

227
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,239
Sorry, ladies.

228
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,520
Sorry about that, folks.
This shouldn't take a minute.

229
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,280
- Oooh!
- Mate, I'm at work.

230
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,720
Katie, we're just saying g'day
to the tourists, yeah?

231
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,080
- G'day, tourists.
- Tourists.

232
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah, you can take the photo, darlin'.

233
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Oooh, please. Pop it out.

234
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,440
Hope you brought
your microscope!

235
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,880
Alright, you've acquainted yourself
with the tourists.

236
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,235
Now would you acquaint yourself
with the other end of the river?

237
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,720
Come on, mate. Let's just fuck off, eh?

238
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,240
No, hang on.

239
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,360
I just wanna know why
Miss Captain Katie Coo here

240
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,960
is acting so high and mighty these days.

241
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,120
What is it, Katie?
Why won't you have a bar of me, sweet?

242
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
Excuse me, son, the young lady
asked you politely to remove yourself.

243
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,597
We'd like to get on with our tour.

244
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,880
Fuck me, it's John fuckin' Wayne.
This is the tour, John.

245
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,480
Me and Col, we're the wildlife.

246
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,080
Hello.

247
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,040
- We're ducks!
- I'm gonna keep this simple for you.

248
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm gonna count to three
and ask you to leave.

249
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,880
What the fuck are you gawking at,
four-eyes?

250
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,360
- One.
- I don't know.

251
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,954
I got the brochure but it didn't
say anything about assholes.

252
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,480
- He's a poofter, mate.
- Two.

253
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,320
I'm not kidding, mate.

254
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,833
Bullshit, Katie.

255
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Fuck!

256
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,713
- Oooh!
- Whoa!

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,560
Jeez...

258
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,073
Get out!

259
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,433
You right there, mate?

260
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,560
- Sorry about that, folks.
- Unbelievable.

261
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,080
As you can see, human pollution

262
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,833
is one of the greatest threats
to the environment out here.

263
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,475
Collin! Collin, you bloody idiot!

264
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,674
- Sorry, mate. I...
- What are you fuckin' doing?!

265
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,754
Forget it, mate. It's over.

266
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,920
About 1 0 days. Yeah,
we got four weeks all up, so...

267
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,960
Nice. I'm seeing things
I don't think my friends would believe.

268
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,509
We got some on you inadvertently before.

269
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,791
Alright, we'll be heading home now.

270
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
Should take us about an hour or so.

271
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,120
I'll have you back in time to grab an
ice-cream on your way back to town.

272
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,520
- Oh, swell.
- Thank you all for a wonderful day.

273
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,078
Finishes now?

274
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,952
Um, special thanks
to John Wayne and to 'Four-Eyes'.

275
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
Top work, Four-Eyes.

276
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,680
I think they deserve a round of applause.

277
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,232
- Thanks, guys.
- Well done. Well done.

278
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,880
Up in this part of the world,
we call you 'top blokes'.

279
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,112
Don't know where I'd have been
without youse.

280
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,640
Please don't film me.

281
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,073
Honey, please don't.

282
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,360
Did you see that?

283
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,715
- No. What?
- I think I saw something.

284
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,394
Flare, I think. Up there. There.

285
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
Should we say something?

286
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,080
- Excuse me, miss.
- My husband just saw something.

287
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,040
I think it was a flare.

288
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,680
- Where'd you see it?
- Up there.

289
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,272
A flare?

290
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,640
Did anyone else see it? No?

291
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,440
- No. No.
- No.

292
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,760
- Wait. I got the tape.
- Yeah. Rewind it a little bit.

293
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,193
Yeah. It's right here.

294
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, Jesus! I saw it.

295
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,752
- Yeah!
- There's one. There's one!

296
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,800
- Did you see that flare?
- I saw it..

297
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Base, this is 'The Suzanne'.
Are you there, Bill? Over.

298
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,280
Base, this is 'The Suzanne'.
Do you read me? Over.

299
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,320
I can't understand you.

300
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm in Kingston Gorge and I'm getting
severe interference. Do you read me?

301
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,440
I think I just saw a flare.

302
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,760
So I'm gonna head upriver
and check it out.

303
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,876
'Suzanne', out.

304
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,480
Alright, we've just seen
what looks like a distress flare,

305
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,400
so we're gonna take a quick run upriver

306
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
and see if anyone's in trouble.

307
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,520
I realise this is a bit of an inconvenience,

308
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,200
but we do have to respond.

309
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I got a bus to catch at 6:30.

310
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,040
Yeah, so do we. We're meeting family.

311
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,000
Who do you think it is?

312
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,760
Could be poachers.
They sometimes go into Arnhem Land.

313
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,960
It could be anyone.

314
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,200
It could be anyone,
and if it was you up there,

315
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,360
you'd want me to respond in exactly
the same way, so keep your seat, sir.

316
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,200
I'm sorry, but my wife and l,
we really...

317
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
- Allen, please. I'm fine.
- I'm not having you here all day.

318
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,112
How long do you think it'll take?

319
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,520
Can't be more
than a couple of miles upriver.

320
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,716
OK, you're alright. You're alright.

321
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,913
Listen, she's fine.

322
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,953
Are you OK?

323
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Not really supposed to go through here.

324
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,880
This is sacred land.

325
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,235
Shouldn't really matter
if someone's in trouble, right?

326
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,993
She'll be right.

327
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,920
I reckon it came from
deeper in the swamp somewhere.

328
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,040
What do you think?

329
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,640
I think we've gone as far as we can.
Besides, there's nobody here.

330
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,471
It's gonna get dark soon.
We should probably go.

331
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,153
Probably right.

332
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,113
What?

333
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,911
Well, I suppose that's where
the flares came from.

334
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,600
This has really gone too far.

335
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,120
We must get back.
I can't have you out here any longer.

336
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,553
OK, we should...

337
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,073
What was that?

338
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,440
- Oh, shit, we're sinking.
- Oh, my God! We're sinking!

339
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,080
- There's a hole!
- What's happened?

340
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,840
Are we moving? Move it!

341
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,070
There! There!

342
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,275
Hold on! Hold on to your seats!

343
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,000
Just hold on to your seats.

344
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,592
We're almost there. Just hold on.

345
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,359
Let's get off. Get off, now!

346
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Get off the boat. Hurry.

347
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,356
Get off the boat.

348
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,955
Alright, there's a radio
in one of these bags.

349
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,478
Should be in here somewhere.

350
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,960
Right.

351
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,600
Can you find it in there?

352
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
No, it's not in there.

353
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,160
It's underwater.

354
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,720
- Oh, shit!
- Is it working?

355
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,760
- What about the boat radio?
- It's wet but it should work.

356
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,440
Stay off the boat.

357
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,280
It's not working, mate.

358
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,760
It's underwater.

359
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,680
Can you take that up on the hill
and see if you can dry it out?

360
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,353
Just keep
switching channels, mate.

361
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,000
No bloody radio!

362
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,390
You've got us stuck on this
tiny little island with no bloody radio!

363
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,200
Great!

364
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,760
Kate?

365
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,600
Emergency. Hello.
Can anyone hear me? Over.

366
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,080
What's going on here?

367
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,840
We're gonna miss the bus.
We're late already.

368
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,320
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. I'm just...

369
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
- So we have no radio?
- I don't want to be here.

370
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,800
Take a deep breath.

371
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,480
- You'll be alright, OK? You know?
- Yeah.

372
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,880
Miss, we have no radio,
so what the hell happens now?

373
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Well, how will anyone know
where we are?

374
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,400
I thought you said
crocs wouldn't attack a boat.

375
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,755
Alright, they're territorial animals, so...

376
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,280
..if we've stumbled into one's territory

377
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,440
it's possible it might've
given us a little nudge,

378
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,200
just to let us know we're not wanted.

379
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,560
"A little nudge"? Tell that
to whoever was in that boat.

380
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,840
My God,
we're in the middle of nowhere here.

381
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
Listen, we have to stay calm, yeah?
We're gonna be fine.

382
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,560
My dad's gonna realise
something's happened

383
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,630
and he'll send a search party to find us.

384
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
When might that be, exactly?

385
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,840
Well, we're a long way upriver,
so it could take a couple of hours.

386
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,800
This is a tidal river, isn't it?

387
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,680
- This is a bloody tidal river!
- What? What does that mean?

388
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,040
See those trees? That's how high
the tide will be when it comes in.

389
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,720
The whole bloody place
will be underwater.

390
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,440
Look, that won't be for hours

391
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,800
and we should have time
to fix the boat by then.

392
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,960
Miss, I don't know a lot
about boats but, seriously,

393
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,509
we can't sit on this pile of mud
waiting to go underwater in pitch black.

394
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,360
If we can get across,
we can walk it in a few hours.

395
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,480
It's the only way we're gonna get help.

396
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,280
- How the hell you gonna get across?
- Well, how do you think?

397
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,120
So, what do you say, mate?
You with me?

398
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,000
- No! No, Everett, no.
- Honey. It's OK.

399
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,200
I am in charge of this group
and what you are suggesting is crazy.

400
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,640
If we don't get across right now
it's gonna be too late.

401
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,153
Alright? You understand?

402
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,720
Well, what?

403
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,160
Would you lot prefer to get through that
in the dark? Come on!

404
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't know! I friggin' well don't know!

405
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,280
- Bloody hell!
- You're not going in the water!

406
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,800
Hey. Hey, buddy!

407
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,040
Come on. Come on, buddy.

408
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,000
- Come on!
- Get your hands...off me!

409
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,120
Hey, hey, hey. Shush, shush!

410
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,798
Shh. I can hear something.

411
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,031
What channel is it?

412
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,720
- Look at this thing!
- Oh, my God.

413
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,440
Where the hell did he go?

414
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,600
Somebody do something! Everett!

415
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,440
Everett!

416
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,240
Everett?! Everett!

417
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,400
- Everett!
- Stand back.

418
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,640
No!

419
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,880
- Come back from the water.
- Get the fuck away from me!

420
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,400
Come back. Come back!
All of you, stay away from the water!

421
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,520
- Everett!
- Jesus!

422
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,636
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be alright.

423
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,240
No! No!

424
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,673
Everett!

425
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,113
Somebody do something!

426
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,600
How long did you say
until the tide comes?

427
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,080
Can you grab that flashlight?

428
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,520
What, like a couple hours, or...?

429
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,360
What?

430
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,954
How long do we have before
the tide comes in? Hours or minutes?

431
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,680
Look, with an animal that aggressive
out there,

432
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,640
I think the tide's
the least of our problems.

433
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,440
It's gonna be dark soon.
We need light to see. It doesn't.

434
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,080
We have to get off the island.
We can't go in the water.

435
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
So how the fuck
are we gonna get off here?

436
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,760
I thought you were supposed to be
some kind of fearless travel writer.

437
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,400
Yeah, well, I just saw a man
get eaten by a fucking crocodile.

438
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,880
This is not what I do, alright?
You know what I do?

439
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,120
I write stupid articles about hotels
and restaurants and resorts,

440
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,160
not about the Australian outback.

441
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,000
And by the way, I fucking hate animals,

442
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,433
especially ones that can kill you.

443
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,993
Speaking of which, I'm gonna kill
my fuckin' editor when I get home.

444
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,913
Can't find the flares.

445
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,520
Would they be in a giant yellow box

446
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,560
with the word 'flares'
written on the side of it?

447
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,278
- Where?
- Over there.

448
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,993
Shit!

449
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,671
We are completely fucked.

450
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,116
Over here! Quickly!

451
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,760
Quickly.

452
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,399
- Did you get something?
- I think it's music. Listen.

453
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,920
It's them.

454
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,229
Whoo-hoo! Hey! Hey!

455
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,360
Whoo-hoo!

456
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,200
Told you to keep going.
Told you they'd be there.

457
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,880
Hey!

458
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,520
Look at that. She's pretty
happy to see you now, mate.

459
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,800
- Mate, watch out!
- Whoo!

460
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,075
Neil, we need help!

461
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,750
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Neil! Watch out. Neil!

462
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,160
Get off the boat!

463
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,720
What are you doing?

464
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,040
Boys!

465
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,800
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down. Slow down.

466
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,160
Come in, you...

467
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,640
- Neil!
- Come back!

468
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,120
I'm not kidding!

469
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,160
What?

470
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,200
I can't...

471
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,360
He cannot hear you!

472
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,080
Now you wanna talk to me? Huh?

473
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,800
What's wrong with the boat?

474
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,960
Swim!

475
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,350
Mate, swim!
Swim! Come on, mate! Keep coming!

476
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,760
Come on, Neil!

477
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
Come on, mate. Hurry up.
You can do it.

478
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,029
Get out.

479
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,596
- Oh, shit!
- Collin!

480
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,913
Collin!

481
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,633
Collin!

482
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,318
Fucking hell!

483
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,438
I can't imagine how she feels.

484
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,831
So, how long before your father comes?

485
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,673
Shit. I can't get this thing to start.

486
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,675
Oh. That worked.

487
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,953
Local technique, mate.

488
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,000
Right, I've figured out
a way to get across.

489
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,479
We just saw that woman...

490
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Well, how you gonna get across
without getting in the water?

491
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,920
I am getting in the water.

492
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,840
Neil...

493
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,274
I'm gonna swim across, real quiet.

494
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm gonna tie a rope

495
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,040
from one of these trees
to one of those trees over there.

496
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,080
We'll suspend it
a few metres above the water.

497
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,560
We all climb across. Piece of piss.

498
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,680
We just saw crocodiles jump
four feet out of the water today.

499
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,560
- My wife won't be able to cross.
- She's gonna have to, mate.

500
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,680
But... can we come back with help?

501
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,640
By the time we get back, you know,
this island's not gonna be here.

502
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,400
Oh, great!

503
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,440
Fucking brilliant!

504
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,400
Oi, your wife will be fine.
We will all be fine.

505
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,600
But we have to move right now
before it comes back.

506
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,720
What makes you so sure
it's going to come back?

507
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,920
Look around you, champ.

508
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,960
We are still in its territory
and it doesn't like it.

509
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,000
Plus he's probably already tagged us,
Katie, so...

510
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,560
- Wh-what?
- Tagged us?

511
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,080
They tag you as a food supply.
They don't stop.

512
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,800
It's like a vicious dog who's guarding
a piece of meat in its backyard.

513
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,392
Jesus!

514
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,318
Then they take you back to the place
where it stores its kills and...

515
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,389
Under a log or a burrow somewhere.

516
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,350
Like I said, now is the best time to move
because the fucker is busy.

517
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,000
Listen, Neil...

518
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
Look, the tide's rising.

519
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,760
We've got no choice.

520
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,830
We go now, we have a chance,
or later...

521
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,833
You figure it out.

522
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,155
- You want a hand, do you?
- Yeah.

523
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,111
My God.

524
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,194
We're going to tie a rope
from the island trees to the shore.

525
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,196
Plan is to climb across.

526
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,280
Mum?

527
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,840
You'll be able to cross fine. Don't worry.

528
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,880
Of course I will, sweetheart.

529
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,360
Course I will.

530
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,880
Neil! Neil?

531
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,200
I don't think this is a good idea.

532
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,839
-Someone's got to cross.
-You don't have to do this.

533
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,110
OK, well, what do we do?

534
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,520
I think...

535
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
I'm not doing this to prove anything.

536
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,071
It's just...

537
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,749
I mean, you wanna go home, don't you?

538
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,556
- Yeah, of course.
- Right.

539
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,512
Here. Hold this.

540
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,760
Why don't you tie it around your waist?
I'll feed it out to you.

541
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,591
You'd better feed it out fucking fast, mate.

542
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,431
- You're not as stupid as you look.
- Yeah, hopefully you're not either.

543
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,473
Keep away from the water.

544
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,475
Right, here's one.

545
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,233
Here's another one.

546
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,840
Why do you think it's doing this?

547
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,880
Heard stories of 'em getting territorial,

548
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,200
but... people just keep going

549
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,633
and they leave 'em alone.

550
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,080
Us being here?
That's gonna be driving him crazy.

551
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,160
He's gonna feel as if we're moving in.

552
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,549
Yeah, but this is still pretty weird, right?

553
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,835
Ready?

554
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,951
OK, we're right?

555
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,153
Can I go first?

556
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,752
I just wanna get home.

557
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,753
Oh, thank God!

558
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,160
He's done it.

559
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,878
- Alright!
- Good work.

560
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,440
I don't know
if I can hold on that long.

561
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,960
Alright, turn around. Both your knees up.

562
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,880
OK, let's go. Up you go.

563
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
Russell, can you get her up
on the rope?

564
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,800
There you go.
Watch your foot.

565
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,400
Alright, Mary-Ellen.

566
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,880
- Grab the rope.
- You'll be right.

567
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,600
Now wrap your legs around the rope
and then it's just like I told you -

568
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,640
one hand in front of the other
and you'll be over there in no time.

569
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,120
That's it. There you go.

570
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,560
- That's it.
- It's doing well.

571
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,040
- Really good.
- Come on!

572
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,680
There you go. You right?

573
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
That's good.

574
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,080
We're gonna have you outta here
in no time. That's it.

575
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,552
Simon, if you see
the slightest move, mate, you tell us.

576
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,120
Liz? I'm gonna take Sherry across.

577
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,800
OK? I'll be straight back for you.

578
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,640
We'll be absolutely fine.
We'll be absolutely fine.

579
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
It's alright, love.

580
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,760
That's it. That's great.

581
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,920
You're across the water right now,
so I just want you to keep breathing...

582
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,640
- Can you see anything?
- Stay relaxed.

583
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,551
Russell, shut the fuck up.

584
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,280
We'll be fine. We'll all be fine.
We'll all be fine.

585
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,713
Just keep going.

586
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,720
You're almost there.
Just keep breathing.

587
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,631
That's it.

588
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,390
Keep... keep breathing.

589
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,320
It's alright, love. Just take your time.

590
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,958
It's not alright.
I can't hold on.

591
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,233
I have to stop.

592
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,120
It's alright, Mary-Ellen.
You're gonna be fine.

593
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,120
Just keep breathing.

594
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,720
- You're gonna be fine.
- What's she doing? She's stopping.

595
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,560
She'll get us all killed if she doesn't hurry.

596
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,757
I can't! I can't! I can't!

597
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,280
Come on.

598
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,480
You're doing fine.

599
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,080
I can't hold on.

600
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,719
Is she right?

601
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,640
Oh, she...she's frozen.

602
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,916
Sherry, Sherry, Sherry. Come on.
We're going. We're going.

603
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,120
- I can't hold on!
- Wait a minute.

604
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,400
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Oi! Oi! Come on!

605
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,000
Don't you fucking
come anywhere near me!

606
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,355
- You fuck off!
- Calm down, mate.

607
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,680
Don't you put her on that rope.

608
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,280
Fuckhead,
the rope won't take three people OK?

609
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,320
I am not going to let that woman

610
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,640
endanger the lives of my wife
and my child!

611
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,280
Slow down and think about
what you're doing.

612
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,800
- Why don't you fuck off?!
- Get down!

613
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,640
- Jesus Christ. Get him down!
- Stay away! Stay away from me!

614
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,080
Get down now!

615
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,600
Fucking don't do that, you stupid fucker.

616
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,080
- Alright, Sherry. I'm here.
- Are you crazy? Get off the rope!

617
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,878
- There shouldn't be three people...
- We know that, mate!

618
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,080
Bloody English idiot.

619
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,560
Keep going, Sher. It's alright. I'm here.

620
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,440
Just... We're right behind you, Sher.

621
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,920
- Just hold on.
- Something just moved.

622
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,200
Mary-Ellen, Allen and Sherry
are on the rope behind you.

623
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,236
It's alright. I'm here.
You'll be across in no time.

624
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,960
Just move, Mary Ellen!
There's two people behind you. Move!

625
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,880
OK, Sher. I'm here. I'm right behind you.

626
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,394
Right behind you, Sher. Keep going.

627
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,440
She's not moving.

628
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,237
For Christ's sake, move!

629
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,080
I can't.

630
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,680
- You can!
- Come on.

631
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,840
Neil, she's frozen. Get her moving!

632
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,512
Keep go...

633
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,240
Neil, she's freaked. Get her moving!

634
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,480
Move!
Move, for God's sake! Move!

635
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,160
Neil?

636
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,640
- Neil, come on!
- Neil?!

637
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,800
- What's happening?
- Oh, shit!

638
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,680
Move! Move!

639
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,272
No, Sher! No, Sher! No...

640
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,960
Oh! Oh!

641
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,553
- Just hold on tight.
- Daddy!

642
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,000
- Oh, God!
- Move! Move!

643
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,600
Do something! Do something!

644
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,033
Don't let go. Keep going!

645
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,753
Come on. Swim!

646
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,476
Oh, my God!

647
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,038
You alright? You alright?

648
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,913
Oh, fuck.

649
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,472
Kate, get back from the water.

650
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,955
No.

651
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,594
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

652
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,873
Daddy!

653
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,873
No!

654
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,749
Oh! Oh, my God!

655
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,800
It can't be long now.
Someone will find us soon.

656
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,233
It'll be alright.

657
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,233
Where are you, you... bastards?

658
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,840
Sorry. Does that hurt?

659
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,720
No. It's... It's fine.

660
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,920
I just... I think... I think I sprained it.

661
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,960
Oh, God!

662
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,715
- How are they?
- Um...Sherry's in... in shock.

663
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,720
And Elizabeth's not doing very well.

664
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,110
She needs to...take her medication.

665
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,760
Where is it?

666
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,520
She...

667
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,960
She left it on the back of the boat,
so its probably floated away.

668
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,714
But there's painkillers
in the, uh...the first aid kit.

669
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,676
They might not come till the morning.

670
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,720
If I hadn't brought us here,
none of this would have happened.

671
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,440
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

672
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,480
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Come here.

673
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,200
- Sorry.
- Come on, it's OK.

674
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,158
It's not your fault. No giving up yet, OK?

675
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,510
Alright? Don't give up.
Don't give up. It's OK.

676
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,233
OK.

677
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,233
There. That's better.

678
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,076
Now let's go find this first aid kit.

679
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,679
Where the fuck is it?

680
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,440
We're dealing with an animal, right?

681
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,240
I mean, at the end of the day,
it's just a stupid animal.

682
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,160
So, I was thinking, maybe
we could make some sort of a trap

683
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,640
and have enough time to swim across.

684
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,120
Jesus, mate.

685
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,320
The only way
we're gonna get off this bloody island

686
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,160
is if someone turns up
with a rather large boat, you know?

687
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,000
I just don't think that's gonna happen.
Do you?

688
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,480
I know that's not gonna happen

689
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,880
but the tide is moving in quick
and people are falling apart.

690
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,360
We've got to do something now.

691
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,600
Bait. We don't have any bait either.

692
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,080
I know we don't have bait.

693
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,720
If we could somehow hook the fucker
on this line with the anchor

694
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,560
and keep it still for just a little bit...

695
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,676
We can use one of the lifejackets
to help keep it afloat.

696
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,480
Right. So, that's great. You wanna
go fishing? Oh, that's nice.

697
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,720
Well, the results are in, Peter,
and you're a fucking genius.

698
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,840
-Shut the fuck up, Simon.
-Well, mate, I'm sorry.

699
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,480
Am I the only one who's noticed
what's going on here?

700
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,960
I mean, there's an animal out there
and it's... it's hunting us.

701
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,880
I mean, why is it still after us?

702
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,680
I dunno.

703
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,720
And it's... it's big.

704
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,240
You know, and it's like... it's like
a fucking steam train with teeth

705
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,880
and...and...and numbnuts here
thinks that we're gonna hold it back

706
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,400
with that bit of dental floss.

707
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,800
Just shut the fuck up, OK?
How much time do we have?

708
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,800
- Um, maybe half an hour. At most.
- We've got a half an hour, OK?

709
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,640
So we can either try and trap this thing

710
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,080
and... and keep it still
for long enough for us to get across,

711
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,720
or we can sit here on our asses

712
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,840
and in a half a fucking hour,
we'll be up to our necks in it.

713
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,910
Fucking Americans.

714
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,428
Yeah. Righto, mate. I'm with ya. Alright?

715
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,359
We haven't got any bait.

716
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,560
Yes.

717
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,993
No.

718
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,360
- No.
- No. I can't.

719
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,840
- Yes, you can.
- I can't!

720
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,920
- I have spent years fighting...
- I said no.

721
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,400
..battling for one more year, one
more moment of knowing my daughter.

722
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,400
I can't.

723
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,000
- I haven't come this far...
- No.

724
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,720
..to go down in some pile of mud
in the middle of nowhere

725
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,438
because you're not prepared
to make a sacrifice.

726
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,797
I'm not gonna let my daughter die.

727
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,993
Oh, my God.

728
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,871
Wait. Wait.

729
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,433
What the fuck's he doing?

730
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,433
They'll eat anything, right?

731
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,913
Hey?

732
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,520
When we swim, you're to go first.
You're not to try to help me.

733
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,680
But how are you going to cross?

734
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,680
One of the others is going to help you.

735
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,272
Well, what about you?

736
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,198
I'll be fine, darling. Let's just get you safe.

737
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,553
Oh, my.

738
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,313
What do you reckon?

739
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,073
Oh, shit.

740
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,920
Need some help with that?

741
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,640
What?

742
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,517
Never mind.

743
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,519
Here, give it to me.

744
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,318
- You're good at that.
- Yeah.

745
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,359
28 years old and I can tie a knot.

746
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,400
Never been anywhere.

747
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,038
Yeah, well, travelling's overrated.
Trust me.

748
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,033
Here we go.

749
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,080
- Who's gonna work the trap?
- Well, doesn't it just sit there?

750
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,920
Crocs sense vibration in the water
through their skin.

751
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,320
We need to keep the bait moving
so it thinks it's alive,

752
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,880
otherwise it won't go for it.

753
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,680
- I'll do it.
- No. You can't with your hand. I'll do it.

754
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,000
- Have you done much fishing?
- Yeah. Once, when I was six.

755
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,480
Well, nothing's changed.

756
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,960
You watch the rope

757
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,200
and the minute you see
that life preserver move at all,

758
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,040
you let us know
and then get the hell outta here, alright?

759
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,080
- I got it.
- And... and then what?

760
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,880
Wait for it to take the bait,
then we head for the other side.

761
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,836
Come on, let's go. Come on.

762
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,560
You sure you wanna be
the last one across?

763
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,993
No. Not really.

764
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,595
Righto.

765
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,713
OK, put that on.

766
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,438
It's getting higher.

767
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,872
This isn't gonna work, is it?

768
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,680
If it doesn't, we're gonna
have to make a dash for it.

769
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,840
So we'll stick together,
swim across as fast as we can.

770
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,273
OK.

771
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,720
I'm, er... I'm... I'm really sorry
about your husband.

772
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,720
I... I can't imagine
what it must be like to, er...

773
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,235
..to not have a chance to say goodbye.

774
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,632
I've been saying goodbye
for the past three and a half years.

775
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,640
We're getting ready to leave. Um...

776
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,073
I can't swim.

777
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,480
I'm not putting anyone else's life at risk.

778
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,960
We...

779
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,640
If I thought there was good reason -
a year, even - I would.

780
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,438
But there's not, so please
don't make this any harder than it is.

781
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,960
Put this on
or you will be putting a life at risk.

782
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,679
'Cause l... I'm not gonna
leave you here, OK?

783
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,279
And you...you got a really good kid there.

784
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,593
Come on, you fuck.

785
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,350
Come on. I've got you.

786
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,278
I love you.

787
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,192
Crocs like the scent of dogs.
He should cross last.

788
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,993
OK.

789
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,312
Promise me you'll take care of him.

790
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,913
Promise.

791
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,033
Alright.

792
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,760
Kate?

793
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,716
- Do you still...
- Pete!

794
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,229
- Go. Go! Get 'em outta here.
- Oh, shit.

795
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,480
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on, it's on!

796
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,960
- OK.
- Get 'em in, mate.

797
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,960
Yeah, right. You just get in there.

798
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,155
Don't worry about your mum.
And swim like hell!

799
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,680
Go. Get in there and go.

800
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,280
That's it. Go.

801
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,720
Go. Swim! Swim!

802
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,153
Don't worry. I've got you.

803
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,280
- Swim!
- Hurry! It's not gonna hold!

804
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,157
Kate, move it!

805
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,633
Come on! Hurry! Go!

806
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,032
- You're OK, Sherry. Go!
- That's it! Go!

807
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,673
Move!

808
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,313
Kate, you gotta move it!

809
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,191
It's not gonna hold!

810
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,560
Mum!

811
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,993
- Can you see Sherry?
- She's there.

812
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,800
Kate! Kate!

813
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,520
Kate, it's loose!

814
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,274
I don't know where it is. Swim! Swim!

815
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,800
Sherry!

816
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,280
Wait!

817
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,872
Go after them!

818
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,960
Head upriver. We'll meet you there. Go!

819
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,320
- OK.
- Go!

820
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,960
We'll catch up with you.
Get outta here. Go! Go!

821
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,393
Kate!

822
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,668
Kate! Kate!

823
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,993
Kate!

824
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,393
Kate.

825
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,433
Kate!

826
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,713
Kate!

827
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,113
Kate!

828
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,320
Kate.

829
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,273
Russell!

830
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,393
Russell!

831
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,793
Simon, wait up!

832
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,473
Simon!

833
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,113
Kevin, come here.

834
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,600
Kevin, come here, you little shit!

835
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,192
Kevin.

836
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,195
Kevin?

837
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,593
Kevin?

838
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,320
Kevin?

839
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,320
Kevin. Come here, boy.

840
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,800
Kevin. Come on.

841
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,473
Arggh!

842
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,713
Jesus.

843
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,233
Kevin.

844
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,313
Kevin!

845
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,320
Kevin, come here.

846
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,833
Kevin!

847
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,673
Kevin, come here.

848
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,719
I said come here, you little shit.

849
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,400
Kevin!

850
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,880
Kevin! Kevin, get back here!

851
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,630
No, no! No!

852
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,035
No! Get out of here!

853
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,753
No!

854
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,475
Come on, you fuck! Come on!

855
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,200
No.

856
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,872
No!

857
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,717
Hey! Hey!

858
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,593
Hey! Hey!

859
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,793
Hey!

860
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,635
Oh, fuck.

861
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,393
Arrgh!

862
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,240
Thanks.

863
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,640
Hey.

864
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,676
Hey.

865
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,317
What did you think of the tour?

866
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:24,072
I was thinking I'm probably gonna
spend a little more time at home.

867
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,233
Thanks.

01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:36,000
* Never smile at a crocodile

869
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,160
* No, you can't get friendly
with a crocodile

870
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,920
* Don't be taken in
by his welcome grin

871
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,760
* He's imagining how well you'd fit
within his skin

872
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,720
* Never smile at a crocodile

873
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,600
* Never dip your hat
and stop to talk a while

874
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,560
* Never run
Walk away

875
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,600
* Say goodnight, not good day

876
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,752
* Clear the aisle
and never smile at Mr Crocodile

877
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,400
* You may very well be well-bred

878
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:50,080
* Lots of etiquette in your head

879
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:54,000
* But there's always
some special case

880
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,120
* Time or place

881
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,040
* To forget etiquette

882
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,560
* For instance

883
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,880
* If you meet a sad crocodile

884
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,960
* Who looks sad and lonely and mild

885
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,440
* He's just hungry
That you can bet

886
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,360
* It's the time to forget etiquette

887
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,840
* Be careful

888
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,240
* Never smile at a crocodile

889
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,480
* No, you can't get friendly
with a crocodile

890
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:25,120
* Don't be taken in
by his welcome grin

891
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:29,159
* He's imagining how well you'd fit
within his skin

892
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,840
* Never smile at a crocodile

893
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:38,800
* Never dip your hat
and stop to talk a while

894
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,760
* Don't be rude
Never mock

895
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,680
* Throw a kiss, not a rock

896
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:48,038
* Clear the aisle
and never smile at Mr Crocodile. *
