I own you, kid.

00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,608
Do you have any
idea how much money

13
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,312
You've cost me because
you've decided to give up?

14
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,179
I'm sorry, Mr. Regetti.

15
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,048
You're havin' those
bad dreams again, right?

16
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,421
I kept seeing her in that ring.

17

00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,723
Shh.

19
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:19,026
She wasn't in the ring.

20
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,528
But you don't understand.

21
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:24,598

me more carefully,

to listen at all.

I'll tell you what.

After you heal up, I want
you to come and visit me.

26
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,946
I'm going to give you
another fight in the ring.

27
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,184
I can't fight no
more, Mr. Regetti.

28
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,620

DR. MAY: I don't
have answers, Cajun.

Maybe I could stay here
for a little while longer.

37
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,013
DR. MAY: A month
is all you needed.

But there ain't
nothing changed.

40

Well, the only way you
can solve this problem

41
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,732
Is to be on the outside.

42
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,167
You could make it out
there, and you know it.

43
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,103
All you have to do is
put your past to sleep.

They're still looking
for me out there.

45

accomplish here is

and stay anytime if I...

No.

64

have a session with me,

66
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,997

comes to pick you up?

70
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:52,212
Because he never
comes to visit me.

00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,981
Why don't you just go down
there and bring him up

72
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,449
So we can say goodbye?

73
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,416
Can't do that just yet.

him in his room.

to see you before you go,

77
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,159
Yeah.

78
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,529
Yeah, sure.

79
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,330
I'll see you in a month.

to my old buddy?

to see me off, boy?

jaunt on outside, now can I?

been out in that visiting room?

you to come back.

You better go.

Thanks for the guitar, man.

145
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,245
Are you gonna play it?

146
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,847
Just like when
I was a kid, huh?

00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,719
- Brothers.
- I'll play it.

148
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,520

Where'd you get the guitar?

153
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,458
I thought you sold yours.

154
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,592
I did.

155
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,328
Legs gave me this one.

156
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,129
Come on.

157
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:42,930
Car's downstairs.

158
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:12,725
So?

159
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,264
Where is he?

160
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,332
Uh, word on the street is...

161
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,034
I don't give a damn about
the word on the street.

162
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,435
Where is he?

163
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,803
Uh, h-he went west.

164
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:24,804
Maybe California.

165
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,739
Nah, I took him
out of VA hospital.

166
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,308
He's probably back there.

167
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,943
Now, sit down.
Both of you.

168
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,948
He was a machine.

169
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,051
The best kickboxer I ever had.

170
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,953
Then he double-crossed me.

171
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,423
So what do you
want us to do, boss?

172
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,959
I'm gonna arrange
his last fight.

173
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,461
H... h... he... he
won't fight no more.

174
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,430
Oh, yes, he will.

175
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,737
He's gonna fight.

176
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,206

You call me.

Hey.

181
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,971
Play for me.

182
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,140
You are gonna come back
to work, aren't you, Cage?

183
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:37,677
I guess I will.

184
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,720

For being here when I need you.

185
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,521
How was your stay?

186
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,322
Did they help?

187
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,593
Them people don't understand...

188
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,028
The dreams?

189
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,129
No, hell.

190
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,464
They don't understand
how to treat a vet.

191
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,600
I'm scared.

192
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,472
They don't know scared.

193
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,339
I know.

194
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,278
Do you?

195
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,346
Hey, just like the hospital,
I can be your friend too,

196
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,214
You know.

197
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,282
Yeah, it's easy for you.

198
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,883
You know, you got
it all together.

199
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,618
(LAUGHING) What?

200
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,220
Oh, big deal.

201
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,591
So I sing and play at the club.

202
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,392
I'm scared, too.

203
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,094
But I'm not giving up.

204
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,062
Hey, wait a minute.

205
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,230
I'm not giving up.

206
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,799
Come on, just because my
mind's on other things

207
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,401
Sometimes... I get caught
up in my own thoughts,

208
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:44,011
And... I guess that is
kind of selfish, isn't it?

209
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:44,811
It's all right.

210
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,081
I do the same thing.

211
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,417
Would you be there for me,
Cage, if I needed a friend?

212
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,731
Hey, uh... tell me something.

213
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:05,999
Who paid the rent
on my apartment

214
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,500
While I was in the hospital?

215
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,335
None of your business.

216
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:12,105

221
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:46,206
I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U. I
quit school when I was 12.

222
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,675
I can't read or write too well.

223
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:54,147
Singing songs is
one thing I can do.

224
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:58,585
I sing the words
I wrote for you.

225
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:08,995
I L-U-V Y-O-U. I need you
B-A-D, oh, baby, I do.

227
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,871
She sounds good tonight.

228
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,772
Boy, she's great.

229
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,114
So you guys, I, uh... I
hadn't said anything before.

230
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,883
But I just want to
tell you... thanks.

231
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,918
Yeah.

232
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,721
We're all glad to
have you back, Cage.

233
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,090
Even though your friend
Pedro, here, saved

234
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,058
All the hard ones for you.

All right.

238
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,818
Thank you.

239
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,787
Thank you very much.

240
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,757
All right, here's Rif Harper.

[Crowd cheering]

242
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,634
(SINGING) Said you really
want to want somebody.

243
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,071
That's what you said.

244
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:29,509
Well, if you really want to want
somebody, why'd you run away?

245
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,279
Why'd you run away?

246
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,914
Guys, have you finished
shredding the cabbage yet?

247
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,884
I only got two hands.

248
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,519
All right.

249
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,520
Go ahead.

250
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,688
Make my coleslaw.

251
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,959
Hey, Cage.

252
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,295
How you feeling?

253
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,197
Just feels good to
have a job, Pedro.

254
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,398
That's cool.

255
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,166
You should have [inaudible]
more often, you see?

256
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,867
Just like me.

257
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,169
I love this place.

258
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,504
I love even these turkeys.

259
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,272
You see, I love cooking.

260
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,440
You wash them up.

261
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,442
And I mess them
up with more food!

262
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,178
Enjoy.

263
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,979
Pedro, where's the gravy?

264
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,949
Since when do we put gravy
on ham and hash browns, huh?

265
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,518
Since I wrote it on the order.

266
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,553
We don't have to like
it to serve it, do we?

267
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:41,981
Hey.

268
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,452
Hey, it's only a broken glass.

269
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,520
I keep seeing it, man.

270
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,389
It won't stop.

271
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,723
It'll go away eventually.

272
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,796
Sure, it will.

Hey.

278
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,984
I'm here.

279
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,986
I don't want to
become your problem.

280
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,087
You're not a problem.

281
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,330
You know, when I was a
boy, my dad used to take

282
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,997
Me fishing down the swamp.

283
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,633
Used to tell me I
could do anything

284
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,134
If I tried hard enough.

285
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,272
Well, I'm trying.

286
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,707
Maybe if you could
tell me what happened...

287
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,577
My daddy died trying to
get out of that swamp.

288
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,245
You're not going to die, Cage.

289
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,246
That's just the whole point.

290
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,714
What am I supposed to be doing?

291
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,983
Am I supposed to be a
dishwasher the rest of my life?

292
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,618
Or is there something
else out there?

293
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,419
There is.

294
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,554
I'll help you find it.

295
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:37,864
(SINGING) You make
me feel so brand new.

296
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:44,236
I'd never needed
anyone like I need you.

297
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,805
I don't know how to
thank you for all the help

298
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,873
You've been to me tonight.

299
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,908
I really appreciate it.

300
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,878
Well, Lacy, that's
what friends are for.

301
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,381
By the way, that
little gal you've got?

302
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,548
You mean Ali?

303
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,418
She is really
something terrific.

304
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,152
I don't know what
I'd do without her.

305
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,121
Say, are you making ends meet?

306
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,591
Mm, hanging in there.

307
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:08,060
Lacy, you never were
a very good liar!

308
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,228
- Now, look...
- You taught me to lie.

309
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,430
I did.

310
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,898
Now, look, me and the
boys got to roll to Vegas.

311
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,166
We got... we open
there tomorrow night.

312
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,268
But I did find out
today that we're going

313
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,937
To be back in LA
for a one-nighter

314
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,406
At the Palace later on this...

315
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,206
At the Palace?

316
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,107
Yeah, at the Palace.

317
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,108
Now, look.

318
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,376
What I'm going to
try and do is get

319
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,878
The stars to come
down here to sit down

320
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,447
With the press and stuff like.

321
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,882
Try and put this
place back on the map.

322
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:30,683
That'd be great.

323
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,331
I know LA, Lou.

324
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,232
Oh, yeah?

325
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,967
You'll be lost in five minutes.

326
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,272
Not this time, Lou.

327
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,243
I bought one of them
little map books.

328
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,578
OK, big shot.

329
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,312
Let's see how long it takes
you to find the VA hospital.

turn gravel into gold,

Cotton into satin, or make
diamonds out of stones,

333
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:56,035
I'd dress you in a satin gown
with golden diamond seeds.

334
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:06,613
For just one hour, you would
be this poor boy's queen.

Honey if I had to swim
across the deepest sea,

336

I'd do it willingly,
just to be with you.

the moon down at your feet,

And crown you with the sun.

340
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:51,791
The universe would finally
know that you and I are one.

341
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:06,205
Honey if I had to swim
across the deepest sea,

342
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:14,581
I'd do it willingly,
just to be with you.

343
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:28,360
I would walk for miles across
the burning desert sand,

344
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,333
Move mountains with one
hand, because I love you.

345
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,310
That was beaut... Cage!

346
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,111
That was good!

347
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,212
Why did you stop?

348
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,046
Come on!

349
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:51,450
What are you... Cage, come on.

350
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,619
What are you... Cage!

351
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,419
Would you talk to me?

352
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,453
Leave me alone!

353
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,922
No, I am not going
to leave you alone.

354
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,390
Why are you doing this to me?

355
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,391
Cage, don't be ridiculous.

356
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,861
Come on!

Could you please tell
us what room he's in?

out last month.

this place on the map again.

to help me with the bookings.

complain about the overload.

Because I want you to
concentrate on your singing.

00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,140
Because I hope you'll
become my permanent MC.

gonna be that great.

now until next year.

It's over 20 miles.

I can do it.

don't think I can do it?

much attention to me, anyway.

Will you write me a song?

And what makes you
think I can write a song?

500
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,270
Because I looked
through your book while

501
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,104
You were in the bathroom.

You looked through my book.

00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,576
Well, yeah.

504
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,710
It was just out
there in the open.

505
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,579
It's like looking at a
magazine in a waiting

Room at a doctor's office.

507
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,415
Except it wasn't a magazine.

508
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,983
You always go around
looking at people's books

509
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,618
When they're in
the bathroom, huh?

510
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,188
No, it was my first time.

What time are you
going to go visit Legs?

512
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,557
You are changing the subject.

513
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,892
Yep, I am.

514
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,194
Would you like a
ride to the hospital?

515
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:51,997
I'll think about it.

516
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:05,444
Bingo.

517
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,416
I thought you were kidding
about coming to visit.

518
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,851
God, this is great.

519
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,353
How you doing, buddy?

520
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:17,223
Well, I've been seriously
thinking about starting

00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:20,025
A patient's union around here.

522
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:22,128
How's that guitar treating you?

523
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,497
Well, I'm writing songs again.

524
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,600
Hey, but, uh... I've
been thinking about you.

525
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,503
You been trying to get
out of here, or what?

526
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:36,442
Well, I've been
rather busy, you know?

527
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:42,047
And besides, if I, uh... if
I go out, I need a new hat.

528
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:45,884
Well, say no more.

529
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,664
Well, you been talking about
getting one for a long time.

530
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,235
Hey, maybe now we
can take that walk?

531
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:06,705
Where?

532
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,910
How about down to the rec room?

533
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,216
It's a nice hat, Cage.

534
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,419
But I got nothing
white to match it.

535
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,588
Well, I guess there ain't no
need in me coming back here

536
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,357
Anymore now, then, is there?

537
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,158
Hey.

538
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:29,060
Hey, Cage.

539
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,630
What's that supposed to mean?

540
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,400
It's so easy for you just to
stroll on out there, isn't it?

541
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,035
I mean, there's nothing left
to lose for you, is there?

542
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,003
Look.

543
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,538
If you start
freaking out, you can

544
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,207
Always go back in your room.

545
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:45,177
But I want you to try, OK?

546
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:49,114
What if somebody sees me?

547
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,583
Ain't worth it.

548
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,084
I'm going back.

549
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,052
Suit yourself.

550
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,554
You ain't gonna meet Ali.

551
00:35:58,624 --> 00:35:59,991
What is this?

552
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,462
Blackmail?

553
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,369
What makes you think
I want to meet her?

554
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,837
She's terrific.

555
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,306
She's one pretty lady, man.

556
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:15,974
She sings and plays
in this nightclub.

557
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:16,775
Club.

558
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,277
Yeah, the club.

559
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,312
That... that's the... that's
the place that you work?

560
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:21,112
Yeah.

561
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,515
You oughta see her.

562
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,418
I could... I could never get
on that stage like she does.

563
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,288
You gotta see her, man.

564
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:32,558
I can't even m... m... make
it down the h... h... hall.

565
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:35,627
How am I ever going
to make to that club?

566
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,629
Because you got
to want to do it.

567
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,031
You gotta want to do
it more than anything.

568
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,402
More than breathing.

569
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,936
I haven't even my jacket on.

570
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,137
I'm going to die right here.

571
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,105
I know it.
Hey.

572
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:47,906
Hey.

573
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,408
Hey.

574
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,642
You ever been in love?

575
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:51,443
Sure.

576
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,311
I was in love.

577
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,679
Sort of.

578
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,048
Then s... s... she left me
when I was overseas.

579
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,216
I can't.
I can't do it.

580
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,017
OK?

581
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,487
I can't.

582
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,924
I can't do it!

583
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:09,895
You know, when I was a
boy... when I was a boy,

584
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,029
My dad used to
tell me, son, there

585
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,832
Ain't no such a word as can't.

586
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,334
Please, Cage.

587
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,169
I want to go back right now.

588
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,237
OK?

589
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,672
None of this funny
business any longer, OK?

590
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:21,907
This has gone far enough.

591
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,174
Listen.

592
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,776
Just take a deep breath.

593
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,245
Just take a deep breath.

594
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,747
And we'll get you
back to the room.

595
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:34,686
I can't even move right now.

596
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:35,687
Isn't that something?

597
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,155
Isn't that a piece of cake?

598
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,327
I can't even walk back to that
room right now if I had to.

599
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:42,127
Damn it to hell.

600
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,128
Damn it!

601
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,596
What'd you bring
me out here for?

602
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,598
Damn it to hell.

603
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,600
I want you to look, buddy.

604
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,235
We come all that way?

605
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:51,202
That's fantastic, man.

606
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,610

Yeah, Mr. Regetti?

611
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,137
Yeah, we found Cage.

612
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,839
And we found his
girlfriend, too.

613
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,878
I'll come pick you up later.

614
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,380
Let's take our
guitars to the club.

615
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,982
We can work on the
songs after they close.

616
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,117
I don't know about that.

617
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:42,588
Nobody'll be there.

618

00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:47,359
What?

620
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,296
Our relationship...
Is it enough?

621
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,768
Yeah.

622
00:38:56,868 --> 00:39:00,238
I don't know when I've been so
happy and relaxed in my life.

623
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,940
See you later, huh?

624
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,775
Hey.

625
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,310
Tell me something.

626
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:10,616
Did you really like
that song I wrote?

627
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:11,583
I love it.

628
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:19,525
Come on.

629
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,628
Just try it.

630
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,630
You know how long it's been
since I've been on a stage?

631
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,702
I was a teenager.

632
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:31,703
Nobody's here.

633
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:32,704
Come on.

00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,205

mean to stare.

(SINGING) But I'm hypnotized.

640

part of you I love the most.

643
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:38,470
(SINGING) I love the way your
body moves when you walk by.

644
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:49,948
I love to kiss your lips
and gaze into your eyes.

You look so good,
and yet I realize...

646
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:07,866
(SINGING) That's not
the best part of you.

You are going to be OK.

You don't have to
be alone now, Cage.

Isn't that what you're trying
to convince Legs not to become?

674
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,447
What brought this on?

675
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:48,159
They had these
little toy water guns.

676
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,829
They were breaking glasses.

And then Pedro and
his friends came in.

And they started
squirting us with guns.

that they were just

innocent, childish games?

It felt so good up there
on that stage, playing.

what other people think?

I guess it's not important.

00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,039
You opened his door to life.

718
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,009
Then why can't I
open my own doors?

719
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:52,510
You are, Cage.

720
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,948
You are more than you realize.

721
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:57,983
Come on.

722
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,584
I want to buy you
some breakfast.

723
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:32,850
I just want to thank you for
spending so much time with me.

724
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:38,156
Thank you for trusting us
to work on this together.

725
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:41,126
I'll see you in a month.

726
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:42,127
You bet.

727
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,067
Appreciate the ride.

728
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:03,248

50!

731
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,685
At $24,000 a head!

732
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:08,886
50!

733
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:14,359
That's... that's... that's...
That's-a lot of money!

734
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:16,962
And if the fight is any
good, money's no object.

735
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:19,797
They don't care who wins!

736
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
But we do.

737
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:24,269
They think the Cajun
is our ace in the hole.

738
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,537
They don't know what kind
of bad shape he is, eh.

739
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:27,905
But we know.

740
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,607
They're gonna put the
money on the Cajun.

741
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:34,712
And our guy, Dr. Death, is going
to beat the shit out of him.

742
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:38,149
We're all set.

743
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,718
I'll make all the arrangements.

744
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,153
We're on.

745
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,621
We are on.

746
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,195
You sound like you're trying
to break it off with me.

747
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,129
Don't.

748
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:52,530
I'm trying to tell
you something.

749
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,331
Hey.

750
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,733
What am I missing?

751
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,502
Cage, look at me.

752
00:48:57,602 --> 00:49:00,005
What do you see?

753
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:03,241
I see a beautiful woman.

754
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:07,378
A woman I want so desperately
to fall in love with.

755
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,514
Then what's stopping you?

756
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,182
Is it me?

757
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,450
Is it what I'm not
doing with you?

758
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,551
Is it?

759
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:15,786
You got this all wrong.

760
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,188
That's great.

761
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:26,197
You can't fall in love with me
because... when I was younger,

762
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,234
I honestly thought
I'd meet Mr. Right.

763
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:31,002
He'd sweep me off my feet.

764
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,238
We'd get married and have kids.

765
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:36,774
Live happily ever
after under God's eye.

766
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,209
Joke's on me, isn't it.

767
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,278
I can't be Mr. Right.

768
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,646
Why?

769
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:45,083
I'm so in love with you, Cage.

770
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:48,153
I want to be in love
with my best friend.

I want to get married.

one step at a time.

773
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:58,396
I never been very romantic.

774
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,700
Maybe you never
had a reason to be.

775
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,103
Maybe.

776
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:06,771
Hey, you said you wanted
to fall in love with me,

777
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:08,206
Didn't you?
Yeah, but-

778
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,407
No buts.

779
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,909
And besides...

780
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,712
What?

781
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:15,846
I think you are
the most romantic

782
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,848

Mr. Regetti would
like to see you.

Yeah?

791
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,670
Well I don't want to see him.

792
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,038

about Vietnam or anything

00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,618
It's money.

I don't need to.

821
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,232

be pursuing you, remember?

funny way of doing it.

01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:39,429
Who's here?

901
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,898
What do you want?

902
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,572
(SCREAMS)

903
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:49,373
[Inaudible].

904
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:49,566
(WHISPERING) Legs.

905
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:50,367
Legs.

906
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:58,742
Shh shh shh shh shh shh.

907
01:02:58,843 --> 01:03:00,210
You outta your... you crazy?

908
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,212
Maybe.

909
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,180
What's going on.

910
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,384
Regetti's back.

911
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:08,886
Oh, shit.

912
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:12,356
He wants me for a
fight to the death.

913
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:13,523
Listen to me.

914
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,625
I need your help, man.

915
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,793
I need to disappear for a while.

916
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,698
OK?

917
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,568
So what about Ali?

918
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:26,136
She's playing this
big show at the club.

919
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:30,440
Buddy Ray Lester.

920
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,241
We'll give him a call.

921
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,043
He can put you up tonight.

922
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,645
And he'll take care of things.

923
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,714
So when's this fight
supposed take place?

924
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,917
Tomorrow night.

925
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:40,918
Oh, man.

926
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:42,386
You're nuts.

927
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,354
Don't tell me.

928
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:46,924
You want to go see her, right?

929
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:49,059
I've got to see her, man.

930
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,061
I mean, she's waited for
this all of her life.

931
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,730
This is her big chance.

932
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,466
I wish you could see her, Legs.

933
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,868
Hey, I'm... I'm
working on just trying

934
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:00,470
To get my ass off this floor...
Not out of the whole building.

935
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,907
Legs, if I don't
fight, they'll kill me.

936
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,910
What's worse is
they might hurt Ali.

937
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,611
I ain't had a fight
in six months, man.

938
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:10,247
I'm out of shape.

939
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,815
Either way, I'll lose.

940
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,617
Take your old lady and get
your ass out of town, man.

941
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:15,285
I don't need you
to babysit my ass.

942
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,386
Go.
Thanks, buddy.

943
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:17,187
Thanks.

944
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,690
Tell us.

945
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:26,496
I'll find out where he is, boss.

946
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,865
Eh... eh... eh, that's enough.

947
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,834
Leave her alone.

948
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,170
You going to tell
us where he is?

949
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,772
I told you, I don't
know where he is.

950
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,574
He's got to fight.

951
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,076
Why don't you just
leave him alone?

952
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:41,045
Well, I got a...
Some of my friends

953
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:43,313
Are gonna get together
tomorrow night.

954
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:45,815
They're expecting
to see a fight.

955
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:48,152
They bet an awful lot
of money on this fight.

956
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:51,121
And your Cage is the
feature attraction.

957
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,456
If he don't want to
fight, they're going

958
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,358
To lose an awful lot of money.

959
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,893
My friends are going
to be very unhappy.

960
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:57,694
I told you.

961
01:04:57,794 --> 01:04:59,829
I don't know where he is.

962
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,865
You play the guitar,
don't you, honey?

963
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:03,567
Yeah.

964
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:06,070
Wouldn't it be awful if
you couldn't play anymore?

965
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,371
What do you mean?

966
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:12,943
Put her hand in the vice.

967
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:15,279
Maybe she can
remember where he is.

968
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,247
No!

969
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:18,715
No... [screams]

970
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:22,352
[Music playing]

971
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:42,772
TOMMY ROE (SINGING):
Don't let me down.

972
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,245
Well, Lacy.

973
01:05:48,345 --> 01:05:50,314
How'd we sound?

974
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:51,381
You sound terrific!

975
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,083
What a sound.

976
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,318
Pedro.

977
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:55,519
Listen... have you seen Ali?

978
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,221
No, not tonight, bro.

979
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:58,722
I don't think she's come in yet.

980
01:05:58,822 --> 01:05:59,756
No, she's got to be here, man.

981
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,158
Sh... she ain't never late.

982
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,926
Hey, why don't you
go and ask Lacy.

983
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,166
You know, Rif was telling
us about this place.

984
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:10,467
It's really fantastic.

985
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,602
Hey, Lacy, have you seen Ali?

986
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,138
No, she's probably
having her hair

987
01:06:14,238 --> 01:06:15,205
Done or something like that.

988
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,540
I mean, she should
have been here by now.

989
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,775
Isn't her rehearsal next?

990
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,378
Maybe she had trouble
getting here, or... Cage.

991
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,646
What the hell's happening?

992
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:23,580
Nothing.

993
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,381
Hey, listen.

994
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,051
Is there anything we can do?

995
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:28,052
No, thanks.

996
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,507
Where is he?

997
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,242
She doesn't know.

998
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,944
She would have told us.

999
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:58,282
What do you want us to do.

1000
01:06:58,382 --> 01:06:59,749
Lock her up.

1001
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,617
Watch both apartments.

1002
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:07,291
When he realizes
she's not around,

1003
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:10,527
He'll go to one or the other.

1004
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:11,328
Shit.

1005
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,365
The fight starts at 6 o'clock.

1006
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:16,233
We don't want to be late.

1007
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:54,571
Damn.

1008
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:04,548
I'll pull the
trigger, if I have to.

1009
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:11,521
Where's Ali, Lou.

1010
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,957
We got her, Cage.

1011
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:15,792
We roughed her up a bit.

1012
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:19,329
I got her waiting for
you at the fights.

1013
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,697
Great for coming out tonight.

1014
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:35,479
(SINGING) Staring
out the window

1015
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:38,615
At the raindrops pouring down.

1016
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:43,520
Takes me to another
time and place.

1017
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:49,493
I had more hair on my head
then, and less lines on my face.

1018
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:54,298
And I didn't have this
spare tire round my waist.

1019
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:55,732
I'm glad you came
to your senses.

1020
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:01,405
Where is Ali?

1021
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:07,411
She's my insurance.

1022
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:11,114
Sort of a guarantee
that you'll fight.

1023
01:09:11,215 --> 01:09:14,150
(SINGING) Turned round,
saw your hair was brown.

1024
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,586
Last night you was
a blonde, I swore.

1025
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:21,558
But my head was so bad, I was
looking just to make a score.

1026
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,893
She ain't Johnnie.

1027
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,863
She ain't bad.

1028
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:32,336
She ain't the best
thing I ever had.

1029
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:37,274
Last night she kept
me from feeling sad.

1030
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:40,777
She ain't Johnnie.

1031
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:44,248
But she ain't bad.

1032
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:49,953
Just in case you do something
stupid, she'll pay for it.

1033
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:50,754
OK?

1034
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:01,265
Let's get this over with.

1035
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:04,634
(SINGING) Met a green-eyed
lady from Oklahoma City

1036
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,371
With a tattoo of butterfly.

1037
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:09,539
She was hotter
than a firecracker

1038
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:13,076
On the Fourth of July.

1039
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:16,546
I kissed her on the lips,
then I kissed her shoulder.

1040
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:18,014
Then I kissed her
on the butterfly.

1041
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:20,350
I waited till she
closed her eyes

1042
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,153
And then I kissed her goodbye.

1043
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:26,055
She ain't Johnnie.

1044
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,492
But she ain't bad.

1045
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:34,964
She ain't the best
thing I ever had.

1046
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:40,404
That night she kept
me from feeling sad.

1047
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:46,376
She ain't Johnnie,
but she ain't bad.

1048
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:50,814
So here I stand just like
a sneaking, peeping tom.

1049
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,816
Peepin' over the back fence.

1050
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:56,286
You've got to see what
Johnnie's [inaudible].

1051
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:58,755
She's hanging clothes.

1052
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:02,225
And though there's
curlers in her hair

1053
01:11:02,326 --> 01:11:06,763
There's still a trace
of my Johnnie there.

1054
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:09,599
She ain't Johnnie.

1055
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,336
But she ain't bad.

1056
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:18,141
She's still the best
thing I ever had.

1057
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:24,013
And coming back here
just makes me sad.

1058
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,516
She ain't Johnnie.

1059
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,184
But she ain't bad.

1060
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,160
[Bell ringing]

1061
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,128
Everybody having a good time?

1063
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:41,230
Great.

1064
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:44,534
Are you ready for
this main event?

1065
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,569
Good!

1066
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:46,970
I hope everyone's
having a good time,

1067
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,905
Because we're about
ready to begin!

1068
01:11:51,708 --> 01:12:00,183
In this corner, wearing red,
the color of blood... Dr. Death!

[Crowd jeering]

1070
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:08,157
And his opponent... his
opponent, you all know.

1071
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:12,629
Coming from the depths of
the swamplands... the Cajun.

1072
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,664
He came, tonight,
out of retirement,

1073
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:16,800
Just for this fight.

1074
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,802
Cage Damante!
