[calm music]

3
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:51,650
[Holly] <i>Once there was
a girl who was invisible.</i>

4
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,688
<i>No one could see her.</i>

5
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,457
<i>And no one could hear her.</i>

6
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:04,528
<i>She wasn't a ghost.</i>

7
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,400
<i>Her invisibility was simply
a fact she had to live with.</i>

8
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:13,706
<i>That girl is me.</i>

9
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,879
- This looks amazing honey!
- [woman] Good!

10
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,581
[Holly] <i>My older sister
was the pretty one.</i>

11
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,816
Melody is such a cow.

12
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:28,385
How come she can eat
whatever she wants?

13
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:31,688
Cows only eat grass, stupid.
And they have a four-part stomach.

14
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,423
[Holly] <i>My little brother
was the smart one.</i>

15
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:39,330
Wanna bet? The rumen, the reticulum,
the omasum and the abomasum.

16
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,100
- Quit showing off.
- Quit tossing your hair.

17
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,369
[Holly] <i>Dad was generally
clueless.</i>

18
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:51,875
How about we enjoy this amazing
dinner your mother made? Mmm.

19
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:54,847
- Troy...
- [Holly] <i>And I was the middle child.</i>

20
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,883
Those green beans
are to die for.

21
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,453
Troy, sweetie.
Holly hasn't had any.

22
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,856
[Holly] <i>Luckily there was Mom.</i>

23
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:06,927
Thank you. Hmm.

24
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,329
[Holly] <i>Mom was interested
in everything.</i>

25
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:17,803
<i>To her the world was full of wonder
and mystery. A puzzle to be solved.</i>

26
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:21,607
See how much it changes when
you rotate it even slightly?

27
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,810
Yeah. It's a kaleidoscope.

28
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:31,748
See, I'm fascinated by the fact that you
can rearrange the same shapes and colors

29
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,586
and get a whole new pattern.

30
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,825
That is the look that means I
don't want to hurt her feelings

31
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,892
but I'd rather be doing
my algebra homework.

32
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,596
- Pre-Algebra.
- Mm-hm.

33
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,700
Alright, get out.

34
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:55,474
[Holly] <i>When she got sick, I wasn't worried
because they said the treatments were working.</i>

35
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:04,547
- What's a simile?
- It's an analogy.

36
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,582
Like um...

37
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:11,922
If I say to you, I love you
like bread loves butter.

38
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:12,791
Oh.

39
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,226
So like...

40
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,728
I love you like laundry
loves laundry detergent?

41
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,829
[chuckling]

42
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:24,970
Exactly. Or I love you
like... A foot loves a sock.

43
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,873
[laughing]

44
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,876
Ow, it hurts!

45
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,846
Oh no... should we
call you a doctor?

46
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,952
- No, no, no, no!
- Tender knees...

47
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,829
[Holly] <i>Then mom died,
and everything changed.</i>

48
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:58,736
<i>Without her, I began to fade.</i>

49
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,543
<i>It started at home.</i>

50
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:10,012
Vanessa, are you feeling okay?
You haven't eaten anything.

51
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:13,718
I just can't have carbs.
I'll puff up like a blowfish.

52
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:18,623
Troy? How's school going?

53
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,458
Fine.

54
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,595
That's great.

55
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,665
You didn't ask me anything.

56
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:29,767
What's that?

57
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,868
Forget it.

58
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,705
Okay.

59
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,755
[Holly] <i>And then it spread
to other areas of my life.</i>

60
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:56,960
[teacher] Just to review,
everyone is reading chapters two and three.

61
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,998
And doing the study questions
in the back of the book.

62
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,501
Does anybody
have any questions?

63
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,505
- Nobody?
- I have a question.

64
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,741
Okay then, have a good weekend.

65
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:12,577
What?

66
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,018
[Holly] <i>And by the end of
the summer, I was gone.</i>

67
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,918
[blending]

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,088
How come nobody woke me up?

69
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,060
Vanessa, would you stop
for a second and look at me?

70
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,062
Ugh!

71
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,065
Troy, I specifically
told you... hey!

72
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,632
What I wouldn't give
for a good night's sleep.

73
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,601
Dad, Troy and Vanessa
are ignoring me again.

74
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:41,670
Where did your mom keep
the camera? Here we go.

75
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:44,575
Does nobody care that I'm going to
be late for the first day of school?

76
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,812
- Dad!
- Aahh!

77
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,149
What the hell was that?

78
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:55,951
Uh, gotta capture the first day of school.
Get over by the window.

79
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,021
Ugh...

80
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:00,089
It's gonna be backlit.

81
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:01,757
It'll be perfect.

82
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,961
I want to be in it too.
Thanks for asking.

83
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:08,799
Perfect.

84
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:13,636
That's a keeper.

85
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:14,904
God, I have a double chin.

86
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,707
[Troy] The lighting is horrible.

87
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,176
I'm not there.

88
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:21,579
I think it's great.

89
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:27,985
What's happening? Why are
you all pretending I'm not here?

90
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,119
[closing door]

91
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:32,123
[Holly] <i>But they
weren't pretending.</i>

92
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:04,019
<i>I didn't want to accept it,
but I had disappeared</i>

93
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,991
<i>from sight and from memory.</i>

94
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,661
<i>It was like I never existed.</i>

95
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,909
<i>I guess it's like anything.
Eventually you adapt.</i>

96
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,047
[doorbell ringing]

97
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,452
- [ringing again]
- [man] Hello. Delivery.

98
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,256
Does it say to ring twice?

99
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:52,270
<i>All things considered,
I live a pretty normal life.</i>

100
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,108
<i>I have my own place in a building
that does corporate rentals.</i>

101
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,812
<i>Nobody knows anybody,
so I fit right in.</i>

102
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,960
<i>And I have a job.</i>

103
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:17,929
[phone vibrating]

104
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,808
<i>Mostly, I work nights.</i>

105
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,871
[disco music]

106
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,344
I'll be right back.
Gotta take care of something, alright?

107
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,095
We ain't got a lot of time.

108
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:05,100
You suck, Bobby. Besides,
you're a married man now.

109
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:08,104
Come on, you know me and her
are just for show. Come here.

110
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:23,619
[Holly] <i>If you think I feel bad
about what I do, you'd be wrong.</i>

111
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,388
<i>I show people
as they really are.</i>

112
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:33,330
[man] Pretty terrific, huh? I'm
telling you, this girl is good.

113
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:35,597
Thank you.

114
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:39,635
And she delivers. Always delivers.
No muss, no fuss. And she's cheap!

115
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,303
- Not anymore, I'm not.
- Yeah.

116
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:43,237
Couldn't be happier.

117
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:46,207
Yeah. [chuckles] It's great.

118
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,243
[cashier noise]

119
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,883
Hang on for a minute.
Who the hell is this?

120
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,150
Who is this?

121
00:10:56,152 --> 00:11:00,889
Oh for heaven's sake.
I just sent you the cover photo.

122
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:07,063
That's it. This girl has a sixth sense.
I don't know how she does it.

123
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,867
What the hell is this?

124
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:16,939
[Holly] <i>As for my family,
Troy still lives at home.</i>

125
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:21,010
<i>He moved to the basement
as a teenager, for the view.</i>

126
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,917
<i>It's what supposedly inspired
his career as a visual artist.</i>

127
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:36,393
<i>Troy has been working on an experimental film
called</i> Top Ten Legs of the Last Decade <i>for...</i>

128
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,428
<i>well, the last decade.</i>

129
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,400
<i>And using our mother's
legs as a benchmark.</i>

130
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:52,442
<i>Vanessa had remained her own number
one fan until she married Marjus,</i>

131
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,443
<i>a Lithuanian elevator inspector.</i>

132
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:58,948
Come on baby.
We're gonna be late.

133
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,522
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

134
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,190
Come, come, come.

135
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:12,928
[Holly] <i>And with that,
she doubled her fan club.</i>

136
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:19,066
<i>And Dad had found a new love
in commercial real-estate.</i>

137
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:24,374
You guys go ahead. I might have found
a buyer for this incredible granary.

138
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,510
<i>Friday night dinner
is still a tradition</i>

139
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,245
- <i>although Marjus is usually held up at work.</i>
- [phone ringing]

140
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:34,482
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I figured.

141
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,419
What floor are you on?

142
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:41,088
Vanessa, you haven't
eaten anything.

143
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,125
Um, meat makes me nauseous.

144
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,198
Troy, how's the job
search coming?

145
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,368
That depends
on how you define job.

146
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:54,502
[Vanessa] Why do you
have to be so obnoxious?

147
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:57,273
- Well why do you have to be so obtuse?
- Enough!

148
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:00,574
No, not you. No, I love you.

149
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,375
[Holly] <i>Not much has changed.</i>

150
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:04,079
[general chatter]

151
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:08,384
<i>My favorite things
about being invisible...</i>

152
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:13,223
<i>Going anywhere,
seeing everything,</i>

153
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:18,126
<i>not having to worry about
rules or good manners,</i>

154
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,599
<i>or even caring what I look like.</i>

155
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,068
<i>Never feeling ashamed
or embarrassed.</i>

156
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:33,142
<i>The worst thing is not
being a part of anything.</i>

157
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:40,015
[disco music]

158
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,460
[screaming] Let's all
have another round!

159
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,163
I think I need to lie down.

160
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,110
[man] Hey!

161
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:10,078
Hey, you!

162
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,048
Hey!

163
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:16,251
Why are you following
those people?

164
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,453
Alright.

165
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:20,557
You can see me?

166
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,225
Ever heard of respecting
people's privacy?

167
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:26,626
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

168
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:27,861
- This conversation is over.
- [man] Blackwell!

169
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:28,730
Wait!

170
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,197
- I'm not letting you back in.
- Wait!

171
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,265
Blackwell, we need you in there.

172
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,468
Wait, don't go, I was just...

Can you see me?

Hello?

[Holly] Mom, you'll never
believe what happened.

I met someone
who can see me.

177
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,635
He could hear me too.

178
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:10,707
Just some random bouncer.

179
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,280
But the bad news is that I'm
still invisible to everyone else.

180
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:25,287
So I... I don't know
what that means. I really...

181
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,294
I don't know how to
put the pieces together.

wrong, little bird?</i>

What's going to happen
when you die?

00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,683
I'll be with you in spirit.

185
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:57,586
Do you know what that means?

186
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:05,728
It means that the wind will carry
me to you, whenever you need me.

187
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,597
- Yeah, right.
- It will.

188
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:11,232
You'll see.

189
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,202
How come you'll be in the wind?

190
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,305
Because

191
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:19,341
the wind

192
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:22,177
is the soul's messenger.

193
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,581
But if I can't see you,
how will I know you're there?

194
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:31,520
Because you'll feel loved.

I can help you, then I'll leave you alone.

512
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:47,911
I don't do crowds that size.

513
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,847
- Why?
- The last time I did I got this.

514
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:53,682
Oh my God.

515
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:57,052
I had to give myself stitches.

516
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:01,590
So I will be watching
you but from home.

517
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,929
Why don't you come
watch the fight at my place?

518
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,731
Okay.

519
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,266
Alright.

520
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:24,077
[door opening]

521
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,012
[Marjus] Come on, baby!
We gonna be late.

522
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:29,751
Hi Marjus. Hey Ness...
Mind if I borrow some clothes?

523
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,753
Does this look too tight
on me? It feels too tight.

524
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:35,157
- You look perfect.
- Perfect.

525
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,093
[Holly] I promise
I'll bring them back.

526
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:13,059
[man] <i>Well Blackwell came into
tonight's match as the underdog.</i>

527
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:17,197
<i>You can see him trying to find his rhythm
against an opponent in his prime like Suarez.</i>

528
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,135
<i>But we have seen him win
a lot of belts in the past.</i>

529
00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:22,737
[crowd yelling]

530
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:35,184
Keep doing what you're
doing, champ! You got him!

531
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:51,199
[man] <i>Blackwell tries to gain
some distance from Suarez.</i>

532
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,752
Yeah!

533
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:25,532
<i>Blackwell looks a bit
stunned but he shakes it off.</i>

534
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:27,336
<i>Suarez now looking
for a takedown.</i>

535
00:42:33,308 --> 00:42:34,943
[whistling]

536
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:38,747
[Brandon] You got
him, you got him!

537
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,352
He's in a tight bout!

538
00:42:45,587 --> 00:42:47,119
Yeah!

539
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:48,854
- [man] <i>And it's all over!</i>
- Yes!

540
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:51,824
<i>Blackwell wins by submission
in the third round!</i>

541
00:42:51,826 --> 00:42:53,293
- <i>Unbelievable.</i>
- Yes!

542
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:54,762
<i>What an upset!</i>

543
00:42:57,132 --> 00:43:00,968
Yeah! He tapped out! Whoo!

544
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:08,575
[announcer] <i>And the winner
is Shayne Blackwell!</i>

545
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:10,212
You're the champ. Number one!

546
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:13,815
[crowd whistling]

547
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:19,954
What'd I tell you, huh?
Stick with me, kid.

548
00:43:21,122 --> 00:43:22,888
You the man!

549
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,127
By the way, that purse is not quite what they
said. Something about taxes what have you.

550
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:30,165
But for the next fight, you're gonna
be making triple what you made now.

551
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:36,037
Yeah! Champ right here!
Champ right here!

552
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,417
[Shayne] Thanks, bud.

553
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:55,421
Shayne? Dan Wolfe, Gotham News.
Congratulations on your big win tonight!

554
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:56,922
Thanks, man.

555
00:43:56,924 --> 00:43:59,326
You went in as the underdog in a lot
of people's minds. What happened?

556
00:43:59,328 --> 00:44:03,363
I mean, Suarez is a great fighter.
He made a mistake and I capitalized on it.

557
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:06,432
Yeah. Rumor has it you're gonna
be fighting Tommy Bones next.

558
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:07,933
Yep.

559
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:10,237
Uh, any reason you're not out tonight
celebrating? Did you get injured?

560
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:14,208
I feel great. And I do
plan to celebrate.

561
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:19,281
[closes door]

562
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:23,250
[opens door]

563
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:28,856
- Hey Maude.
- You did it.

564
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:30,591
Felt pretty good.

565
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:35,963
- Oh my God, your eye!
- Looks worse than it is.

566
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:42,403
You take that.

567
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:44,939
Come on.

568
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,042
I want to show
you ladies something.

569
00:44:56,451 --> 00:45:00,019
There you go. Hey,
stick that thing in the door, will you?

570
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:04,258
There you go.

571
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:08,362
- Not bad, huh?
- Wow.

572
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,404
Here you go, I got this for you.

573
00:45:19,073 --> 00:45:20,706
And this is for me.

574
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,377
- What kind is it?
- Peanut butter ice cream.

575
00:45:24,445 --> 00:45:26,313
The best thing ever
after a fight.

576
00:45:36,757 --> 00:45:38,492
I couldn't have
done it without you.

577
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:46,066
You looked great out
there. You really did.

578
00:45:47,134 --> 00:45:48,202
Thanks.

579
00:45:52,138 --> 00:45:53,507
You look good, by the way.

580
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:57,144
Thank you.

581
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,358
Can I ask you something?

582
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:13,260
Yeah.

583
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:17,164
Are you sure you're real?

584
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:19,333
What is that supposed to mean?

585
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:21,969
You know.

586
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:28,174
Maybe I took a few too many
hits to the head over the years.

587
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:33,245
You know just because people can't
see me doesn't mean I don't exist.

588
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:35,781
Alright, see? I knew you
were gonna get mad.

589
00:46:35,783 --> 00:46:38,419
- You're writing me off.
- I'm not writing you off. I'm just...

590
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,355
trying to understand.

591
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:49,330
Hey.

592
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:53,567
I want you to be real.

593
00:46:57,137 --> 00:46:58,338
Prove it.

594
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:23,562
[barking]

595
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:26,300
Hey! Come back with that camera.

596
00:47:28,435 --> 00:47:29,503
No, no, no!

597
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:35,273
Well hey, jokes on him.

598
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:37,243
It's gonna look like
you're alone in that picture.

599
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:46,453
Hope you like sleeping
under the stars.

600
00:48:08,341 --> 00:48:09,442
Come here.

601
00:48:22,623 --> 00:48:25,224
Your heart is
beating really fast.

602
00:48:52,418 --> 00:48:54,320
Okay, whoa!

603
00:48:57,189 --> 00:48:58,324
Is this okay?

604
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:03,129
No, it's... it's good... it's...

605
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:07,701
It's really good. It's just new.

606
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:20,680
We can take our time.

607
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:25,551
Okay.

608
00:49:28,287 --> 00:49:30,524
[soft music]

609
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:49,569
What?

610
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:54,240
I don't know what to do next.

611
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:04,717
I got some ideas.

612
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:52,531
I'm in the photo.

613
00:51:57,603 --> 00:52:00,439
I'm in the photo! Yes!

614
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:03,409
Thank you!

615
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,680
[man] Tommy, as a two-time
platinum belt winner,

616
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:12,482
what's your prediction
going into the fight?

617
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:14,752
- How many times did I win that belt?
- [man] Two times.

618
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:17,621
Man, this joker been out
of the game for five years.

619
00:52:17,623 --> 00:52:20,724
I bet you right here, I get that
submission in the first round.

620
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:22,493
[man] Shayne, what
do you say to that?

621
00:52:22,495 --> 00:52:24,596
I've been working hard and
I know what I'm capable of.

622
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,132
All that matters is what
happens in the cage.

623
00:52:28,134 --> 00:52:31,568
Only thing that'll happen in that cage
is I'm gonna beat your ass like a drum.

624
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,906
Shayne, is it true you
fired your manager?

625
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,372
Yeah, we parted ways.

626
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,609
You sure it wasn't
the other way around?

627
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:39,742
I'm gonna give you
a little preview

628
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:41,613
of what it's like when I
mop the floor with his face.

629
00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:45,617
I'm gonna make it look like
Matae took it easy on you, baby.

630
00:52:46,618 --> 00:52:48,585
Why don't you walk over here,
I'll knock you out right now.

631
00:52:48,587 --> 00:52:49,887
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

632
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:51,487
[Tommy] The fear
in his eyes, man.

633
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:53,591
Alright, we have time
for one more question.

634
00:52:53,593 --> 00:52:57,727
Shayne! Is Julianna
King Shadow Girl?

635
00:52:57,729 --> 00:52:59,429
What?

636
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:01,865
There are rumors going around that you and
Julianna King are getting back together.

637
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:03,435
Is she the woman
in this picture?

638
00:53:07,606 --> 00:53:08,839
No comment.

639
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:10,776
[reporters overlapping]

640
00:53:11,577 --> 00:53:13,777
- [Tommy] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [man] Tommy, Tommy!

641
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:15,881
Oh, my people. Here you go!

642
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:21,920
Don't' forget: you look good, you feel
good. You feel good, you fight good.

643
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:28,560
You look good, you fight good.

644
00:53:30,763 --> 00:53:31,895
Yeah, we waiting on someone.

645
00:53:31,897 --> 00:53:36,401
Well Tommy, I'll get right
down to business, shall I?

646
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:39,437
[text message alert]

647
00:53:44,476 --> 00:53:45,011
Ha!

648
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:49,979
Yeah, right.

649
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:51,416
[Holly] Hm.

650
00:53:53,585 --> 00:53:54,686
[text message alert]

651
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:00,825
Oh shit!

652
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:04,697
Yep.

653
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:10,902
[text message alert]

654
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:17,676
Get the f...

655
00:54:19,045 --> 00:54:20,578
Yeah, alright.

656
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:30,722
Yes or no?

657
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:33,992
This is some bullshit.

658
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:38,630
Playing games with Bones.

659
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,633
- Okay Kevin.
- Yep.

660
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:44,869
See you next week.

661
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,771
[Holly] Hi.

662
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:48,740
Hi.

663
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:54,744
When are you gonna quit? You
don't have to work here anymore.

664
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:55,880
It keeps me humble.

665
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:01,720
Why did you let them
think it was Julianna?

666
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:04,087
What are you talking about?

667
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:06,992
At the press conference
when they asked you about...

668
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:10,762
- Shadow Girl?
- I thought you didn't show up in pictures.

669
00:55:11,629 --> 00:55:13,897
I don't... usually.

670
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,638
So you're coming back?

671
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:25,043
You're coming back!

672
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:41,559
You... you made me
feel like... like I matter.

673
00:55:43,795 --> 00:55:45,063
Of course you matter.

674
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:53,071
[phone ringing]

675
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:58,674
Hello?

676
00:55:58,676 --> 00:55:59,544
[Julianna] <i>Hi.</i>

677
00:56:00,678 --> 00:56:01,546
Julianna?

678
00:56:03,815 --> 00:56:05,081
Hold on just a second.

679
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:09,085
<i>I heard we might be getting
back together. I'm just kidding.</i>

680
00:56:09,087 --> 00:56:12,989
<i>Congratulations on the Suarez fight.
That was pretty impressive.</i>

681
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:13,992
Thanks.

682
00:56:15,226 --> 00:56:18,797
<i>Well uh, I will be rooting
for you during the next one.</i>

683
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:22,365
You in town?

684
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:25,569
<i>For a few weeks, my new
movie's coming out so...</i>
