00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,583
[Nate] God.

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:38,666
I get tuna every time and I hate tuna.
You know I hate tuna, but I just... get it.

4
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,642
- It's like... What'd you get?
- [Fielding] Italian.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,125
See, that... That's a good choice.
Italian is a good sandwich.

6
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,208
- [man] What's up, babe?
- [Nate] Oh, no.

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,375
Fields, whatever you do,
don't look to your left.

8
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,333
[sighs] Oh, no way.

9
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,375
[Nate] Sorry, pal.

10
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,375
Just one week into senior year.
How'd she just leave me?

11
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,708
Apparently by text.

12
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,041
[sighs]

13
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,583
I... I can't eat this.

14
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,625
- I feel so alone.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,916
"Loneliness and the feeling
of being unwanted

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
is the most terrible poverty."

17
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,583
Mother Teresa, who, by the way,
I guarantee you was never dumped.

18
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:20,166
I mean, seriously, you dump her,
that is one-way ticket downstairs.

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,791
Shh! Is that the guy?

20
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,333
[Nate] Who?

21
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,375
- She left me for a Frisbee guy?
- You're a Frisbee guy.

22
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,138
[Fielding] No, not like him. He's, like...

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
shirtless.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,666
He looks great.

25
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,500
- Thank you.
- Well.

26
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,583
I think that tonight,

27
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,458
we should go down to the Bobcat,

28
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,375
get some drinks, get some wings,

29
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,583
forget about Claire and this Adonis.

30
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,208
You...

31
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,291
Where'd you go?

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,583
You aren't listening.

33
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,833
Let's go to the pound.

34
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,625
- [dogs barking]
- This is a mistake.

35
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,875
Okay, I have love to give,
and Claire doesn't want it.

36
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,583
I love you, babe. Me, I do.
Can we go now, please?

37
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,791
I am getting a dog.

38
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,708
When was the last time you showered?

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
It was a Tuesday.

40
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,875
Listen, dogs, they need shots.
They need food and water every day.

41
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,000
- Okay?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,083
You are just...

43
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,250
You're ill-equipped.
I'm sorry. You just are.

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,625

- Oh, no.

"For if all the beasts were gone,

man would die

- It's Chief Seattle.
- I know it's Chief Seattle. I know it is.

48
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,791
Just listen. A B-minus
in Native American studies

49
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,875
does not qualify you
to care for an animal.

50
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,041
- Also, please don't ever do that again.
- Why?

51
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,458
It's very off-putting when you quote
smart dead guys back at me.

52
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,458
That's my thing.
Philosophical arts, my thing.

53
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,875
- You know it.
- Okay.

[Fielding chuckles]

Whoop! That's a big bag.

65
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,541
All right. Oh, and I need him to imprint
on me, so don't, like, bond with him.

66
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,750
Done and done.

67
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,541
You know what, little buddy?
I am gonna find the perfect song

68
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,083
for our first car ride together.

69
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,875
Why is it so warm in here?

70
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,208
I told you, the AC is still broken.

71
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,666
- Oh, my God!
- Don't scare him.

72
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,458
- He's peeing on me!
- Whoa! Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,601
- Fields, take your dog right now.
- I don't want him!

74

- I don't want him!
- Hold on!

75
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,316
Take him right now. I swear to God.

76
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,250
Listen, I don't want his first
five minutes with us to be traumatizing,

77
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,583
so just, like, let him do his thing.

- He likes you.

Why is there so much?

82
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,458
- [urinating continues]
- I don't...

83
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,666
Yeah. Wow. All right.

84
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,583

Oh, a little bit more.

89

Okay, he's done.

90

Very good boys. Both of you.

- You love me.

Oh. You know this is all for you, right?

This is your homecoming.

106

This party is fun.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,208
I cannot believe
that all these people showed up for...

108
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,583
What is his name?

109
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,250
I don't know.

110

He gonked me on the head.

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,375
- He did what?
- I mean... I mean bonked.

- Wait, that's it.
- What is it?

- "Gonker."

- What is a gonker?

What did I tell you? The boy is talented.

I'm not opening a haunted house with you.

139
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,666
[woman] Wait.
Did you guys hear about Lainey?

140
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,750
- What?
- She got a job at Boeing. Six figures.

141
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,166
- No, stop.
- [Fielding] Really?

142
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,166
- [Nate] Wow.
- Six figures? Like, in money?

143
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,625
- Yeah, and she gets to stay in Virginia.
- Stop.

144
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,958
- I don't know anyone in St. Louis.
- What's in St. Louis?

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,041
- My job.
- Yeah.

146
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,916
I'm doing PR for Anheuser-Busch.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,059
- I start in, like, two weeks.
- You didn't know that?

148
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,041
- You're working for a beer company?
- Dream job, right?

149
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,250
Wait, hold on. Do... Do you all have jobs?

150
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,333
Uh, yeah, bud, we do.

151
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,541
Kinda. We just, uh, didn't...
didn't wanna say anything.

152
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,875
Well, okay. Wait, hold on now.

153
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,833
I'm... I'm not some loser
who can't get a job.

154
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,916
I just...
I don't know what job I can do yet,

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,625
so I gotta, like,
figure that out first, you know?

156
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,958
Right. Isn't that kinda what
the last four years were for, though?

157
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,166
Mmm...

158
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,875

- Uh, we're 21.
- It's 10:30 in the morning.

What... What are you guys doing here?

167
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:41,375
Well, I... I think my investment entitles
me to see you in a robe and a funny hat.

168
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,708
Well, graduation's tomorrow.

169
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,625
Yeah. We told you
that we were coming up the day before.

Right. Sorry. I forgot about that.
I've, um, been busy.

Well, we have a surprise for you.

174
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,041
Oh.

175
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,541
Oh, a surprise!

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,375
Is that Peyton I see? Come here!
What? Oh, my God.

177
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,958
W-What are you doing here?

178
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,583
You know, I took my last exam early

179
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,875
so I could fly out
and see my bro get his parchment.

180
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,458
- Look at you. Best sister ever.
- You know. I try.

181
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,750
- [Gonker barks]
- Oh!

182
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,083
Whoa, Gonker! Sorry about that.

183
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,583
- That's okay.
- Whoa, hey!

184
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,309
- [Fielding] All right.
- Whose dog is this?

185
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,333
[Fielding] He's...

186
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,708
It's a bad idea.

187
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,166
Okay, well, it's not an idea.
It's a reality.

188
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,250
It's a mistake.

189
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,166
He's not a mistake.
He's... He's my best friend.

190
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,000
You can't even take care of yourself,
let alone another living being.

191
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,291
Okay, I take care of Gonker just fine.

192
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,458
So why's he drinking out of a beer bong?

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,333
He's not. That's a chemistry thing.

194
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,208
Come here, Gonker. Come on, buddy.

195
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,791
Come on, let's go.

196
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,708
- What kind of a name is "Gonker"?
- He gonked me in the head.

197
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,125
I see you haven't recovered
from the trauma.

198
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,416
Look, son, you're about to head out
into the real world.

199
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,541
You're not gonna have any time
to spend with Gonker.

200
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,625
What's he gonna do
when you're at work all day?

201
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,708
"Work"?

202
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,625
Dad, come on.

203
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,958
Have you called Mr. Kobrenner?

204
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,041
Accounting? I suck at math.

205
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,666
Or Matt Price at Harper Lewis.

206
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,416
Dad, I'm not equipped
to handle medical supplies sales.

207
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,083
Then what are you gonna do
when, in 24 hours, this whole party ends?

208
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,125
Other than be back at home
with Mom and Dad,

209
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,208
exactly where you were four years ago.

210
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,041
[tense music playing]

211
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,458

00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,875
Hi.

213
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,375
Uh, excuse me, sorry. Hey.

214
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,291
Uh, come on. Excuse me, sorry. Sorry.

215
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,500
Oh, Mom, Dad.

218
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,541
I don't know what to say.

219
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,458
Um...

220
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,541
It's fine.
I'm sure there'll be another ceremony.

221
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,041
Oh, wait. There's only one.

222
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,750
Fielding, what happened?

223
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,291
Well, I really took to heart
what Dad said yesterday

224
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,041
about how I only
had 24 hours left here, so...

225
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,791
Uh, Gonk and I slept out by the river
'cause he loves it there.

226
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,166
We listened to frogs
and talked about the stars.

227
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,125
- You talked?
- And we played flashlight chase.

228
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,833
- He likes to chase a light on the ground.
- We can do the math.

229
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,833
Right.

230
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,958
And we must have fallen asleep
pretty late, 'cause, um, I overslept.

231
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,750
Well, I'm sure it's worth
the six-hour round trip

232
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,583
just to see 4,000 strangers
all dressed in the same outfit.

233
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,666
It's okay. We can still go out
for a celebratory meal, right?

234
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
Actually, Mom, I, um...

235
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,625
My stomach's been feeling a little off
the past few days.

236
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,250
Uh, maybe we can rain check?

237
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,375
Sure.

238
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,125
Yeah, we'll have plenty of time
for family meals back home.

239
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,791
It's all right. I, uh...

240
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,125
It's okay. Accidents happen.

241
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm really proud of you.

242
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,708
- And I love you.
- I love you too.

243
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,625
Well, congratulations on graduating.

244
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,541
Drive safe.

245
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,000
Thanks. And, again, I'm so sorry.

246
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,791
Um...

247
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,416
I'll see you tomorrow.

Wait, just you, you...
You cannot leave me alone with them.

251
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,328
I got a summer job
in the Creative Writing department.

252
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,791
Look, you say
you don't wanna live with the 'rents,

253
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,958
then why don't you get a job
and go pay rent?

254
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,208
Besides, you won't be alone, right?
You got Gonker.

set up outside right by the woods,

And if he does, he gets a little zap.

513
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,791
Who's a good boy?

514
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,250
Yes, you are.

515
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,916
The summer
that we went to Mohonk, New York.

516
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,250
Ugh. I fished every day in the lake
for two weeks.

517
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,875
I got nothing but a sunburn.

518
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,833
- [all chuckling]
- How do you do that?

519
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,375
Oh, hey.

520
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,916
[John] There he is.

521
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,583
The stinky foul beast,
and he brought his dog.

522
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,791
[Ginny] Oh! John...

523
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,708
Oh, you remember the Goodwins, Fielding?

524
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:35,041
- Yes! Hi.
- [Mrs. Goodwin] Good to see you again.

525
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,750
You were out for a long time.

526
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,333
Yeah, we stopped at Mr. Platt's
so Gonk could play with Yuri.

527
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,096
It's good for him to play with other dogs.

528
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,333
- Yeah. Well, can I make you a plate?
- Uh, o, thank you.

529
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,291
You never eat.

530
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,000
- He's preparing for a life of poverty.
- [Ginny sighs]

531
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,041
- Oh! I got him.
- Hey! Hey!

532
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,666
- That's mine.
- He loves pie.

533
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,541
We're gonna do some yoga
before I hit the shower, so...

534
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,458
- It was great seeing you guys.
- [Ginny] Come back and eat, okay?

535
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,166
- You tease him too much.
- I'm just having fun with him.

536
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,720
[Mr. Goodwin] Must be nice
to have him home.

537
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,041
[John and Ginny] Mmm.

538
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:08,583
Yes and no.

539
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,500
Look...

540
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,333
[sighs] I was broke in college.
I worked my way through with three jobs.

541
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,375
And when I graduated, I had employment.

542
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:20,541
You know, and when my father was 21,
he'd served in a war.

543
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,000
[Ginny] Yeah, but he
just hasn't found his path yet.

544
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,791
[John] Yeah, well, he better,
'cause I will not be Tim Misner.

545
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:30,041
His son's 35 years old and just
moved back into the house with them.

546
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,708
It's what keeps me up at night.

547
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,666
[dramatic music playing]

548
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,410
[Nate] My class isn't boring,

549
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:41,166
and the last question
that I asked on the test was,

550
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,458
"Is atheism a religion?"

551
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,750
- Oh.
- I know. Like, how do you answer that?

552
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,666
You can't. It's not a thing.

553
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,291
So, I just gave everybody an "A"
and watched <i>The Office.</i>

554
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,666
Nice. You know,
the thought of you teaching undergrads,

555
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,166
it's kind of terrifying.

556
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,125
- I know.
- Terrifies me.

557
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,916
- [fox chirping]
- Check that out. A fox.

558
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,333
You see the fox? Go get the fox!

559
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,666
[Gonker barks]

[Gonker barks]

561
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,434
- [Fielding] Zoom!
- [Nate] There he goes.

562
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,500
See fox, chase fox.

563
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,833
Why can't my life
be as simple as Gonker's?

564
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,041
I know, right?

565
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,125
It's good to see you.
Thank you for driving up.

566
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,791
Yeah. You sounded pretty down
on the phone.

567
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,041
Your dad's just kidding.
I mean, you know that.

568
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,625
Mmm...

569
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:31,458
Nah. Like, I always knew
he was disappointed in me, but this time...

570
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,041
- I don't know, he just seemed embarrassed.
- He's not. He's not embarrassed.

571
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,458
He's not. He's just...

572
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:38,875
your dad.

573
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:39,958
He just doesn't get it.

574
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,791
Like, I'm very well aware
of how lucky I am.

575
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,125
- Right?
- I am.

576
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,583
You know, to have two parents

577
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,000
who busted their asses
to send me to school.

578
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,976
- Yes, they did.
- And gave me every opportunity.

579
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,226
Like, I'm just trying to figure out
what to do with that.

580
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,250
What does that mean?

581
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,791
It's hard to find a career
when you're not good at anything.

582
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:56,750
You are good at stuff.

583
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,208
- Okay.
- Yes, you are.

584
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,041
It's not like I can get paid for kayaking.

585
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,125
- [Nate] You might be able to.
- Gonker!

586
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:03,875
Come here!

587
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,958
Gonker!

588
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,416
[Fielding] He ran fast. Gonker!

589
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,875
Gonky buddy, ya hiding?

590
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,500
Gonker!

591
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:24,458
Gonker!

[suspenseful music playing]

593
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:29,916
[Fielding] Gonk!

594
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,416
Gonker!

595
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Gonk!

596
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,583
Gonker!

597
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,083
Gonker!

598
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:44,750
Gonker!

[suspenseful music continues]

600
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,208
Gonker!

601
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,125
Mom! Dad! He's gone!

602
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,583
- [both] What? Who's gone?
- [Fielding] Gonker.

603
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:58,625
- What happened to your face?
- I fell down a ravine looking for him.

604
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,708
- Where?
- [Fielding] The Appalachian Trail.

605
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,541
He went after a fox
and he never came back.

606
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,465
Nate and I,
we were looking everywhere for him.

607
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,208
- He's somewhere out there right now.
- There are coyotes out there.

608
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,331
- They're gonna eat him alive.
- That's not helpful.

609
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,416
This is why I told you to use a leash!
I knew this would happen!

610
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,458
- When was the last time he had his shot?
- Ten days ago.

611
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,750
So he's got 20 days tops.

612
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,833
Fielding, what is wrong with you?

613
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,750
[John] This is what we're gonna do.

614
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:25,541
First of all, we're gonna realize
that we're not gonna find him tonight.

615
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,541
Right? You're gonna take a deep breath,
we're gonna clean out this cut

616
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,583
and we're gonna
plan something in the morning.

617
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,166

Mom.

622
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,625
Please. It's so cold out.

623
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,291
He's fine. He has a fur coat.
I don't have a fur coat.

624
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,041
He's been out there for hours.

625
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,916
I am not letting that bear of a dog
inside while I entertain.

626
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,916
Now go to your room and be quiet
or you'll find yourself outside with him.

627
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,250
Come on, boy.

628
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,500
Come on, let's go.

A 2,200-mile trail

638
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:12,625
and the parks department
only has two rangers assigned to it.

639
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,125
What's going on?

640
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,791
Oh, the library gave us phone books
for every county in Virginia.

641
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,791
- At least I think it's every one.
- Why?

642
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,416
Because I'm analog.

643
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,083
And if I search online,
I'm just gonna print it all out anyway.

644
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:27,083
That's hundreds of loose pages.
This way, it's easier to manage.

645
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,833
No, why are you doing this?

646
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,541
Because we have to find Gonker.

647
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,545
[John] So we should start
with pounds, obviously.

648
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,892
- Animal hospitals.
- Yeah. Right.

649
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:37,208
And let's do Rockbridge, Rockingham.

650
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,958
- And Augusta.
- Okay.

651
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,375
Also, every town,
we should talk to the police department.

652
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,017
- [Ginny] Yes.
- Talk to animal control.

653
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,708
We should talk to, uh, churches.

654
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,333
Anywhere people congregate
and go for information.

655
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,750
Yeah, local newspapers.

656
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,833
- VFW halls.
- Yes.

657
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,916
Rotary Clubs, Elk Lodges.

658
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,083
You're talking hundreds of places.

659
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,750
Yeah. You have a better idea?

660
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,000
No.

661
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,166
Well, there's no other alternative.

662
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,791
I'm gonna stay here
and I'll work the phones, take out ads.

663
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,541
Ads? Don't you think
social media is more effective?

664
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,425
I don't do that stuff.
That's your department.

665
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,833
And search and rescue.

666
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,875
Your mom's gonna hold down
the command center here, but you and I

667
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,208
are hitting the Appalachian Trail.

668
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,541
So if we focus, we work hard,

669
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,000
and make calculated, deliberate decisions,

670
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,333
and I promise you, we will find that dog.

671
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,208
Right? Hurry up, get dressed.
We only have so much daylight.

672
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,291
Okay.

673
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,750
You promise? How can you say that?

674
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:31,958
Because I believe it.

for it to be this quiet the whole time?

679
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,958
I'm checking to see
if Gonker's word is getting out.

680
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,041
How's it going?

681
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:07,333
Just friends saying they hope we find him,
but nothing useful.

682
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:12,166
Can we play something
with a little more pep?

683
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,625
I'm not feeling peppy.

684
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,750
This whole thing's my fault.

685
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,458
Thanks for doing this.

686
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,250
We haven't accomplished anything yet.

687
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,750
Caesar never thanked his generals
until they delivered a victory.

688
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:31,833
I'm not Caesar.

689
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,458
No, you're not.

690
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,833
But you're trying to solve this situation.

691
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,208
That's a start.

696

If you want to find him,
you need to find him.

697
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,375
Have you found Jesus Christ?

698
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,083
Well, we're a member of the church.

699
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,083
We probably don't go
as often as we should.

700
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,458
- You're selling those?
- Best in the county.

701
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:41,916
I've got the perfect one for ya.

702
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:55,041
Saint Anthony
is the patron saint of lost souls.

703
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,291
He'll help bring Gonker's soul
back to you.

704
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,625
Let us pray.

705
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,250
Saint Anthony, guide these men
as they search for their beloved hound.

706
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,208
Amen.

707
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,250
Amen.

708
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:12,208
Um, well, here's a ten.

709
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,833
Five for the figurine
and five for the prayer.

710
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,500
Appreciate you.

711
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:17,833
Same to you, brother.

of our dogs match that description.</i>

716
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay. Well, maybe could you just
put up a flyer in the office?

717
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:46,916
Can do.

718
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,375
And I'll make a bunch of copies

719
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,333
and have our shelter volunteers
pass them out around town.

720

Jerry Malcolm.

721
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,625
Thank you so much.
We're so appreciative of your kindness.

Gonker!

Gonker! Gonker! Gonker!

728
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,583
Dad, Dad, you're not a French ambulance.

729
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:29,166
Oh, I'm sorry.
I would hate for me to embarrass you.

730
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,583
- At least you admit it.
- Admit what?

731
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,125
- That you're embarrassed of me.
- Don't be ridiculous.

732
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,458
Am I being ridiculous?

733
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:41,500
Because what's the opposite
of embarrassment? It's pride.

734
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:44,916
So, can you say you're proud
of how I live my life?

735
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:49,125
You know, from my ripped jeans
to my choices and everything in between.

736
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:52,958
Well, Fielding, obviously,
there are decisions that you've made,

737
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,666
how you spent your time in college,

738
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,875
how you're spending your time now,
that I don't... I don't agree with.

739
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:02,000
- And, frankly, I don't understand them...
- I guess we're just two different people.

740
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,791
- Let me finish what I'm saying.
- There's no point, you know?

741
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,958
'Cause I know that you think
that I'm irresponsible, and immature,

742
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,166
and, you know,
Gonker's gonna die 'cause of me.

743
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,958
- Fielding.
- There's hikers coming.

744
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,291
Um, hi! Excuse me.

745
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,625
I'm looking for my dog.
Just wondering if you've seen him.

746
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,125
Or maybe you can help
spread the word if not.

747
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,666
Yes, hi. This is Ginny Marshall.

748
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,666
I just emailed you a note with a flyer
explaining my family's situation and...

749
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,125
That's call waiting. I'll try you back.

750
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,208
- John?
- Ms. Marshall.

751
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,833
This is Kyle Gans at the <i>Virginia Sun.</i>

752
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,333
I got your email.

753
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,666
Oh! Thank you for calling back
so quickly, Mr. Gans. Yes.

754
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,625
Um...

755
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:45,875
I was wondering if we could put
a, um, a lost dog ad in your paper.

756
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,416
<i>I'd be happy to reimburse you
for any expenses.</i>

757
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,208
Actually,
I'm thinking of something bigger.

758
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,666
I was struck by what you wrote.

759
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,000
It was deeply personal.

760
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,500
You're clearly heartbroken over your dog.

761
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:03,875
Oh, well, yeah, I...
I did write the note, but, actually,

762
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,750
<i>Gonker belongs to my son.</i>

763
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,041
Really?

764
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,791
Because it reads like you lost your dog.

765
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,833
<i>Anyway, with your permission,</i>

766
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,750
I'd like to write an article
about your search.

00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,333

- An article? Really?

771
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,583
With a photo of Gonker and everything.

772
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:33,291
The Connor boys are here,
they're setting up a scanner for me,

773
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,017
'cause the newspaper said
we need a certain resolution or something.

774
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,458
I don't know. I called Janie
and she sent 'em right over.

775
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:40,333
Great. Make sure you give 'em both a 20.

776
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,750
[Ginny] Yeah, I already tried.
They refused.

Isn't this wonderful?

The <i>Virginia Sun </i>has a circulation
of, like, 6,000.

779
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,083
I mean, Gonker has been
retweeted double that.

780
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,500
We still haven't heard anything.

781
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:53,166
Well, every little bit counts, right?

782
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,875

[John] It's what?

794
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,625
All my friends,

795
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:59,375
okay, they've all gone
and started their lives, and

796
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,291
I'm happy for them.

797
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,041
But it's like they pity me.

798
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:09,208
I totally feel it. And you and Mom,
you guys judge me too.

- Dad, yes, you do. Every day.

mom, and your dad, and their friends,

804
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,708
when everyone
looks at you like you're a loser, it's...

805
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,750
[laughs] It's nice to have

806
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,958
one soul on earth who thinks
you're fine just the way you are.

00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:45,416
Because you are you.

811
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,666
That's who Gonker was for me, Dad.

812
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:54,541
[voice breaking] Gonker was the only one
on the entire planet who...

813
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,291
Who liked me just the way I am.

814
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,750
Son, you're worried about Gonker
because you love him and he's lost.

815
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,625
That's why I worry about you.

816
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,583
You just did it again.

817
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:19,416
Just because I'm trying to find my way
or whatever doesn't mean I'm lost.

Hi.

823
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,791
Hi, um, were you handing these out
in the Hardee's earlier?

824
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,541
Yeah. Have you seen him?

825
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,208
Uh, no, sweetie, I haven't,

826
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:54,000
but when my Tucker ran off
a few years ago,

827
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,750
we went around with his brother Butchie,
and Tucker picked up his scent real fast.

828
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:00,625
Some folks think dogs will pick up
the scent of another canine

829
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,625
before they will a human scent.

830
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:06,000
It's kinda left over
from when they needed to find their packs.

831
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,916
I thought maybe it could help.

832
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,750

- Ah, you kiddin'?

835
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:35,791
Yuri loves Gonker, and vice versa.
No doubt old Gonk will know his scent.

836
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:38,041
I promise he'll never be off leash,

837
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,875
and we'll feed him well,
get plenty of exercise.

838
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,583
[Mr. Platt] Fresh air will do him good.

839

Need him back a week from today.
Heading to Florida till the spring.

840
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:48,083
You got it.
Hopefully, we'll be back with two dogs.

00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,375
[John on megaphone] Gonker!

847
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,333
Gonk!

848
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,875
- [John] Hey, excuse me.
- [hiker] Hey, how are ya?

849
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,583
[John] We're looking for our dog.
Maybe you can help us.

850
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,906
- Seen anything around here?
- No, haven't seen anything.

851
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,053
- [Fielding] Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

852
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,291
- [dramatic music continues]
- [John on megaphone] Gonker!

853
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,666
Gonker!

854
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,750
Gonker!

855
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,875
Gonker!

856
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:40,958
[Fielding] Gonker!

857
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,833
[John on megaphone] Gonker!

858
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,166
[woman] I'd love to help.

859
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,041
I have a friend at the high school,
lets me make copies for free.

860
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,208
I can put one up at the church,
the market.

861
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,791
Oh, and the quarry
employs a whole lot of folk.

862
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,666
I'll make sure they find one
on their windshield after work.

863
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:00,291
- Thank you. You're a godsend.
- Tell my ex that. Good luck.

864
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,416
- [motorbike revs]
- What about those guys?

865
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,666
- [Fielding] Are you sure?
- Talk about covering a lot of ground.

866
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,583
Right. They're on motorcycles.
They can't ride the trail.

867
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,626
We don't know
if Gonker's gonna stay on the trail.

868
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,166
- He could head into a city.
- Okay.

869
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,208
But they just don't
look like the type of people

870
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:18,791
you approach about this kind of thing.

871
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,750
Son, if you live in a bubble,
eventually you suffocate.

872
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:32,083
[indistinct chatter]

873
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,083
Pardon the interruption.
I was wondering if any of you gentlemen

874
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:42,250
had, uh, possibly seen
our missing dog on your travels?

875
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:45,166
He disappeared two days ago
on the trail, um,

876
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:50,041
and if we don't find him within 18 days
and give him his medicine, he could die.

877
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,625
His name is Gonker.

878
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,416
- His name is "Gonkers"?
- "Gonker." Singular.

879
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,791
It's one dog.

880
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,875
[menacing music playing]

881
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:01,708
Gon-ker.

882
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,125
That's a stupid name.

883
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,625
I gave my dog a stupid name once.

884
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:12,833
"Macaroni."

885
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Yeah.

886
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,291
He was five when he got out of the yard.

887
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:20,916
Never came back.

888
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:25,208
I still dream about him.

889
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:29,166
What happened to your guy?
How'd he get lost?

890
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,166
Um...

891
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,625
I had him off the leash, so...

892
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,500
Uh, it's my fault.

893
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,583
You need to forgive yourself.

894
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:49,458
I beat myself up for years
on account of Macaroni.

895
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,041
It does you no good.

896
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,791
And it does no good for Gonkers either.

897
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:55,875
Gonker.

898
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,291
We've got chapters up and down the coast.

899
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,541
And we'll make sure that every
Asrael's Knight keeps their eyes peeled.

900
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,541
- Oh.
- Thank you.

901
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,375
And thank all the other knights.

902
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,541
Uh, yeah, thanks.

903
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,791
[bikes revving]

904
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:25,125
[Fielding] No dogs.
Next motel is over 30 miles away,

905
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:28,458
and their website says,
"No pets over 15 pounds."

906
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,875
All right, let's put his bowls
in your bag.

907
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,375
No, they said, "No dogs."

908
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,666
Yeah. Little laws are for little men.

909
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,375
- The fine is, like, $300.
- Come on.

910
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,208
Ancient trading caravans on the Silk Road

911
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,458
would stop at campgrounds
on their way to the Orient.

912
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:46,821
You know what they called those?

913
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:49,041
Holiday Inns that don't allow dogs?

914
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,333
"Caravansaries."

915
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,666
Not only were there camels allowed inside,

916
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,875
the guards would welcome them
and protect them.

917
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,333
- Oh.
- We are a caravansary.

918
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,625
So they are required to welcome our camp.

919
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,083
Come on. Okay.

920
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:03,625
- [playful music playing]
- Put the coat around me.

921
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,541
- What is this, <i>Scooby-Doo?</i>
- Come on, come on! He's heavy.

922
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,625
Okay, I'm gonna distract the front desk
while you slip by,

923
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,375
and I'll meet you at the elevators.

924
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:16,666
Let's light this candle.

925
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,666
I am not paying the fine.

926
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,125
Of course not. You'd need money for that.

927
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,833
[phone ringing]

928
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:26,875
Hello.

929
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,750
<i>[woman] Your dog is with a bad man.</i>

930
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:31,375
Who is this?

931
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,416
[woman] <i>My neighbor Claude got him.
He got all kinds of animals.</i>

932
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
<i>Lord knows what he does to them.</i>

933
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:40,625
<i>I see lots of dogs get brought in,
but I ain't ever seen one come out.</i>

934
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:43,583
I don't understand.
She says this guy's harming animals?

935
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,916
That's what she said.
We should call the police.

936
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,333
[Fielding] <i>And tell them what?</i>

937
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:49,750
They can't enter the guy's house
on an accusation.

938
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,375
They'd need probable cause for a warrant
and there's not enough to get one.

939
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,875
Intro to Constitutional Law, B-plus.

940
00:49:56,958 --> 00:50:00,750
Look, we'll have a conversation
with the guy and we'll see what's what.

941
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:03,458
- Do we have an address?
- [Ginny] <i>I just texted it to Fielding.</i>

942
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:06,333
Oh, also, Fields,
um, I need you to get the word out

943
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,833
on my new Twitter and Instagram handles.

944
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:12,708
It's, um, @RealGonker and @FindGonker.

945
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,291
Hey, you guys be careful
at this Claude fella's.

946
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,958
He might be some kinda serial killer.

947
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:20,583
Yeah, you're absolutely right. That's why
I'm gonna send Fielding to the front door.

948
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,291
[Ginny laughing] <i>Great.</i>

949
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,833
Be safe. I'm serious.

950
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,250
Bye.

951
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,166
[man] All my paperwork's up-to-date.

952
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,916
I'm fully licensed to act as a non-profit,
temporary shelter for strays.

953
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,708
I'm sorry. My wife called me
and said I should check it out.

954
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:34,791
I don't know.

955
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:37,083
It's... No, this isn't
the first time it's happened.

956
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:41,333
The woman who called, Mrs. Banner,
98 and, uh, losing her faculties.

957
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:45,000
It's been explained to her a dozen times
what we do, but she just forgets.

958
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,059
- But her heart's in the right place.
- [John] Sure.

959
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:50,043
- Listen, we're sorry to take up your time.
- You're not taking up my time.

960
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:54,083
Look, I'm fully plugged in
to the animal rescue community.

961
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:55,375
I'm gonna scan this, okay?

962
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,750
I'm gonna get a chain going.

963
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:00,958
We have folks, they spend every weekend
searching for strays just to try and help.

964
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,708
They need to know about Gonker.

965
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,916
Well, thank you.

966
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah, thanks.

967
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,083
You okay?

968
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,000
Oh, yeah, I just...

969
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:10,916
I was hoping he'd be here, but...

970
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,958
Let's just hope for a miracle.

971
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,166
[somber music playing]

972
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,083
- Ah, good! You got some calories in you.
- [Fielding] Mmm.

973
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:48,541
Mmm-hmm! Um...

974
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:53,208
So, I was thinking today
we make our way down to Elkton.

975
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:54,375
Elkton.

976
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,833
- That's quite a ways.
- Well, we don't have a choice.

977
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,875
It's like we say, Gonker isn't any dog.

978
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,916
As hard as you're searching for him,
he's searching for you.

979
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:07,625
[man] Hi. Um, so sorry to bother you.

980
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,125
I was wondering,
maybe, if you've seen this dog?

981
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:13,375
Well, we sure have, 'cause he's our dog.

982
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,625
Hold on. You're the Marshalls?

983
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:17,625
That's what the mailbox says. And you are?

984
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:18,708
Um, Tracy.

985
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,125
I can't believe this.

986
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:24,541
I just read about you guys yesterday,
and it just made me feel so sad.

987
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,958
So I made a bunch of these
to hand out while I hike.

988
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:28,541
That is incredibly nice of you.

989

Wow, I guess the <i>Virginia Sun</i>
did us a solid.

in <i>Roanoke Times.</i>

- Can I see that flyer?
- [Tracy] Yeah, of course.

Ha! This is from the Associated Press.

993
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,875

there's certain foods
that you can leave out for Gonker,

00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:29,291
- [stirring music playing]
- [phone chiming]

1013
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:30,875
I can't keep up with all the calls.

1014
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,208
People are reaching out from all over
the world with tips on how to track him,

1015
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:37,250
how to lure him out of the woods,
how to help him find your scent.

1016
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,708
Well, I don't think
they're gonna need help with that.

1017
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:40,791
Meaning?

1018
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,166
You're working on kind of a...
patchouli musk.

1019
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,208
- Have you smelled your cologne?
- Aw.

1020
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,333
- Sounds like you two are getting along.
- Oh, no, it's Stockholm syndrome.

1021
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,083
Anyway, I put everyone's tips together
in a Google doc,

1022
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,666
and I just shared it with you.
I sent you a link.

1023
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,416
I recognize your voice,
but you cannot possibly be my mom.

1024
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,583
Ha-ha. Very funny.

1025
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:03,833
- [stirring music continues]
- [John on megaphone] Gonker!

1026
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:06,500
[Fielding] Gonker!

1027
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,625
- Man, this is beautiful country.
- Oh, I know.

1028
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:23,958
I took the youth center kids
on the trail a few times.

1029
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,041
Like, to a stream.

1030
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:27,625
Kayaked all day.

1031
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:32,000
- They loved it.
- Sounds like you did too.

1032
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:33,791
Yeah.

1033
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,208
So you...

1034
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:45,916
You might think this is,
like, dumb or whatever, but, um...

1035
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:51,750
I was thinking about maybe
one day working in that field.

1036
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,000
Doing what?

1037
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,291
Uh, you know, like,

1038
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,166
outdoor tours, nature tours,
stuff like that.

1039
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,375
Is there a living in that?

1040
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,375
I don't know.

1041
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:08,875
Just a thought.

1042
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:09,958
Ow.

1043
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,583
[Fielding winces]

1044
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:15,333
[John] Hey!

1045
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,333
Hey, you okay?

1046
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,125
Oh, yeah, it's just some blisters.

1047
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:25,250
Look, we're a half mile from a rest stop.
Why don't we take a break?

1048
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,500
No, we should keep going.
He's only got two weeks.

1049
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:32,750
All the more reason
you gotta stay healthy.

1050
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,958
We've got a lot of ground to cover.
Come on.

1051
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,833
Hey. We should
definitely check in with those guys.

1052
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,833
Yeah, I have flyers, and I can recite
the story in my sleep, so...

1053
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,125
Are you coming?

1054
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,750
Thought I'd let you handle it.
Look like your kind of people.

1055
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:08,416
If you live in a bubble,
you eventually suffocate.

1056
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,416
Now he listens to me.

1057
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,875
[indistinct]

1058
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,625
[man blowing]

1059
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,208
You're gonna hyperventilate.

1060
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,625
See, you got the wrong stuff in there.

1061
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,166
If the kindling bends like this,
it's too wet.

1062
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,875
Unless it breaks,

1063
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,250
it doesn't burn.

1064
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:36,000
So you need

1065
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:38,958
more stuff like this.

1066
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:43,416
See, now...

1067
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,583
- Yeah, that's kindling.
- [man chuckles] Wow.

1068
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:52,583
- You're, like, full of dad knowledge.
- Ha! I don't know about that.

1069
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:54,746
Talk to my son,
he'll tell you I'm full of something.

1070
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,375
- He's pretty awesome.
- Fielding?

1071
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,666
Yeah, man.

1072
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,916
Going out on the open road,
searching for his best friend.

1073
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,375
He's got a real loving energy
that's hard to come by.

1074
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,708
It's like you two are on,
like, an epic journey together.

1075
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:08,791
Like a quest.

1076
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,375
- An epic quest.
- Yo.

1077
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:12,666
A vision quest, like the movie.

1078
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,250
Matthew Modine, Madonna,

1079
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,208
singing in a Pennsylvania
Appalachian bar? No?

1080
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,833
That's what makes
what you're doing so cool.

1081
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,750
Not many dads
would walk the trail for their kid.

1082
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:30,750
Yeah. I mean, my old man,
he thinks everything I do is stupid,

1083
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:34,250
like writing my music, or making my plays.

1084
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,916
No, he doesn't think you're stupid.
He loves you.

1085
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:40,583
Writing your plays and making your music
isn't gonna pay the bills.

1086
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,375
You know, or get you health care coverage,
so he worries.

1087
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,000
That's what dads do, they...

1088
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:46,916
[laughs] We worry.

1089
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:51,625
Mr. Marshall, we were all born in 2000.

1090
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,375
The first humans of the new millennium.

1091
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,041
With technological advances,

1092
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:59,250
the odds are greater
we'll live past 100 than die before 40.

1093
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,458
So what's the difference
if on our deathbed,

1094
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:04,541
we had 54 years in the workforce or 53?

1095
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,791
If we die with a little less money
to leave our kids

1096
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:09,875
but a lot more life experience
and knowledge to pass on?

1097
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:14,916
Some people know exactly what they want.
And others don't, like me and my friends.

1098
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,375
At the end of the day,
we're all just walking the trail.

1099
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:23,375
It's just some of us wanna
wait a bit longer before we step off.

1100
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,458
That's all.

1101
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,916
You know, I think my son's been
trying to tell me his version of that,

1102
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,583
like, half a dozen times, and...

1103
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:34,833
Don't know why I didn't hear it until now.

1104
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:37,750
'Cause I'm not your son.

1105
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:46,166
[exhales] All right. This was a good day.

1106
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,291
Just another day
with no dog to show for it.

1107
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:53,166
Well, people who don't even know us
now know Gonker.

1108
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:57,583
And the dog can only travel so far,
and the story is now outpacing him.

1109
00:58:57,666 --> 00:59:00,125
So it's a good thing. Believe me.

1110
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,208
- Really? Again?
- [playful music playing]

1111
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,291
Really? All right.

1112
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,125
[grunts]

1113
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,416
This is why I haven't been able
to get much rest.

1114
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,916
I'm so used to Gonker being
in bed with me, I can't sleep without him.

1115
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,500
- Yeah, Well, you're welcome to this one.
- Oh, no, I think he likes you.

1116
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,083
He just won't stop moving.

1117
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:29,375
Can you stop?

1118
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,541
See if we can pull this off.

1119
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:36,541
Remember, today was a good day.

1120
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,541
[indistinct coughing]

1121
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:09,833
- [somber music playing]
- [Yuri whining]

1122
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:14,875
[heaving]

1123
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,291
[Yuri whining]

1124
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,541
[scratching on door]

1125
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:32,916
[Fielding groans] It's okay, boy.

1126
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:35,833
I'm okay.

1127
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,750
Oh! Thanks for all your help, Yuri.

1128
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,083
- [John] So you have enough water?
- Yep.

1129
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,833
- Food?
- PowerBars and beef jerky.

1130
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,958
- You actually gonna eat any of it?
- Yes.

1131
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,541
Good. 'Cause take this in the spirit
with which it's intended,

1132
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:58,958
but you look like a bag of crap.

1133
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:01,875
- Thank you very much.
- So you'll take Spotswood up to...

1134
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,358
- To the main trail.
- That's right.

1135
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:06,291
- And I'll meet you in the parking lot at...
- Browns Gap. Got it.

1136
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:09,666
It should take you about ten hours
of walking, and I'll see you tonight.

1137
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,583
- Be safe.
- I'll be fine. Promise.

1138
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,791
- See ya.
- [car starting]

1139
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:17,958
Be good.

1140
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,750
[somber music playing]

1141
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:37,583
[young Ginny] <i>Oji?</i>

1142
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,791
Oji?

1143
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,208
Oji?

1144
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,333
Where's Oji?

1145
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,625
I need you to be a big girl about this.

1146
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:09,416
Oji got loose this morning
and ran into Fulton.

1147
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,041
He was struck by a car.

1148
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,083
He didn't make it.

1149
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,833
I'm sorry. I know you liked him,
but these things are a part of life.

1150
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:25,375
Now, I told your father you would
likely make a big thing about this.

1151
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,541
Prove me wrong.

1152
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,375
Show us that you won't carry on

1153
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:32,125
and you will be rewarded with
a day of shopping at Josie's Boutique.

1154
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:35,041
'Cause the truth is, no amount of crying
will bring him back.

1155
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:37,583
So why waste that energy, okay?

1156
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,958
[somber music playing]

1157
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,166
- [gasps] Oh.
- Ooh.

1158
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,375
- Oh, gosh, you scared me.
- [John chuckles]

1159
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:10,583
I missed you.

1160
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,875
- I missed you too. What a week.
- [Ginny] Mmm-hmm.

1161
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,125
[John sighs]

1162
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,791
So Yuri's back with Earl,

1163
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:20,500
and I am so looking forward to a shower
with a regular-sized bar of soap.

1164
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:21,583
Ugh, I bet. [laughs]

1165
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:27,125
I don't think I've seen a room like this
since Russell Crowe was doing math.

1166
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:29,166
Yeah, I've been listening to a podcast

1167
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,166
of the Bushmen in the Kalahari
and how they track antelope,

1168
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,791
and I was thinking there could be
something to that that's applicable here.

1169
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:36,958
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1170
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:38,666
And also I've been putting up trackers

1171
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,670
where everybody said that they've
seen Oji, but the description was wrong,

1172
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,875
but I figure maybe if there's a pattern
to his movements, we should follow up.

1173
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:47,476
Because who knows, maybe every tipster
just described him wrong.

1174
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,580
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

1175
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:51,916
Yeah, and then there's one other thing.
And you're gonna think I'm crazy.

1176
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,375
- Animal psychics.
- Okay.

1177
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:55,750
- What?
- No, I'm worried about you.

1178
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,208
I'm fine! There's just
a lot of information coming in,

1179
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:00,791
and I'm trying to control it all.

1180
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,625
- He's not Oji.
- I'm just trying to...

1181
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,458
- What?
- Gonker is not Oji.

1182
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,500
I know that.
This has nothing to do with Oji.

1183
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:11,791
You have to stop
putting pressure on yourself.

1184
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,041
It's...

1185
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,125
It's just that
it's happening all over again.

1186
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:26,833
I promised myself that I would never care
about another dog again,

1187
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,250
and then here I am.

1188
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,833
Heartbroken again.

1189
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:33,541
Look, look, look, I...

1190
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,875
I promise you it won't happen again.

1191
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,250
We're gonna find this dog.

1192
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,541
- You keep saying that.
- I know.

1193
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:44,750
Because I believe it.

Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message.</i>

1197
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:10,000
Look, I am officially beyond worried
to extremely concerned.

1198

You were supposed to be here
40 minutes ago.

1199
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,750
I'm gonna go
to some of the other trailheads.

1200
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:17,416
If you end up here,
stay put because I'll be back.

1201
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:22,476
- [Ginny] <i>Why wouldn't he be answering?</i>
- [John] Reception's spotty on the trail.

1202
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
He could have a dead battery or...

1203
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:25,583
Or what?

1204

[John sighs] <i>The kid is skin and bones.
He hasn't eaten. He's not sleeping.</i>

1205
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,083
It's dark. He's tired.
I hope he didn't hurt himself.

1206
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:35,416
I've been up and down this trail.
He's over two hours late.

1207
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,916
- You should have called me sooner!
- Well, I didn't wanna worry you.

Come on.

- [John] I got you. Ready?

- You're pushing yourself to the brink.
- [weakly] I had to cover more ground.

1222

Gonker needs me.

1223
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,041
Remember the other day you were asking me

1224
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,416
if I was proud
of how you were living your life?

1225
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,750

1226
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,500

- You didn't let me answer.

1227
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,958

- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, no.

Will you listen for a minute, okay?
Please.

1229
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,708
I can't take pride in your clothes.

1230
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:58,375
Okay? I can't take pride
in living in a cabin

1231
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,338
or any of those kind of things
because they're just that, they're things.

1232

That's not what fathers take pride in.

1238
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:24,333
The kind of character that rescues a puppy
from a shelter and gives it a home.

1239
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:28,791
The kind of character
that would walk all night on bloody feet

1240
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,041
before it would give up
on someone it loves.

1241
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:33,458
So,

1242
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:38,875
you're asking me if I'm proud of you.
I have always been proud of you.

Twenty-four miles? That's insane.

1249

That's what I told him.
But he's not listening. He's dedicated.

1253
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:22,625

We'll pick some up at town.
It's starting to get dark.

1259
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:43,125
What if he comes back to the trail
at night and we're not here to find him?

1260
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:45,489
The experts were telling your mom
if he's anywhere nearby,

1261
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:47,000
he's gonna pick up your scent.

1262
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,666
I just...
I don't think we've been anywhere nearby.

1263
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:53,375
- Don't give up hope.

Fielding?

1269

- Nate?
- [Nate] Hey, man!

1270
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,541
Ow! Oh, God. Ow.

1271
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,458
Ow.

What are you doing off the trail, man?
You could get lost, you could get killed.

1273

I know! I almost did right there.
Listen. Wasn't my intention.

1274

I'm not real good
at following all these markers.

This is my fault.

1287

I'm the one who pointed out
the fox to Gonker, so this is my fault.

You know that I loved him.

- Nate.

It's more of a food for the soul

1306

I'm thinking about selling out,
going to Wall Street.

becoming a "philosophical artist"?

01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,958
You know, he could have died.

1507
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:54,208
- From ulcerative colitis?
- Yeah.

1508
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,583
Sure, if remained untreated long enough.

1509
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:58,375
But just so you know, he's okay.

1510
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:05,291
From what I saw in surgery,
he spent weeks in acute pain and distress.

1511
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:08,083
Any reason why he would have
waited so long to seek medical care?

1512
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,583
It's gonna sound crazy. He...

1513
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,541
His dog was lost.
He wanted to keep looking.

1514
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,583
[chuckles] Yeah, well.

1515
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,083
Hansel and Gretel on their birthday,
so I get it.

1516
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,708
- When can we see him?
- Give him a couple of hours.

1517
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:25,751
He and his dog are gonna have
many more birthdays.

1518
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,791
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1519
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:32,291
Hey, if Hansel and Gretel ever go missing,

1520
01:26:32,916 --> 01:26:33,958
look us up.

1521
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:36,291
- Sounds good. Thank you.
- [Ginny] Thank you.

1522
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:38,083
Oh, my gosh!

1523
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:43,208
And here he is,
chewing on his favorite pillow.

1524
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:45,250
And then, look,
this is his favorite stick.

1525
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,000
Every single time, he gets that one.

1526
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:50,791
And the vet is shocked
at how strong he is.

1527
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:54,416
Except for a few sores on his paws,
he's gonna be fine.

1528
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:00,458
He looks sad.

1529
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:03,000
Because he's wondering
where his buddy went.

1530
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:06,750
Well, if it isn't
the Marshall family pet detectives.

1531
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:09,791
- [John] Hi, doc.
- Hi. How are we doing today?

1532
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,958
Uh...

1533
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:12,625
I want to go home.

1534
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,541
Gonker looks miserable without me.

1535
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:18,416
Well, he's gonna continue missing you
if you don't get some rest.

1536
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,208
The nurse said
you've been tossing and turning all night.

1537
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:23,250
The body heals when it sleeps.

1538
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,625
Yeah, he doesn't sleep well
without his dog.

1539
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,083
Well, do the best you can.

1540
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:31,708
Your body needs it.
Like, really needs it. Okay?

1541
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,431
- [Fielding] Yeah, okay.
- [doctor] Great.

[playful music playing]

1543
01:27:40,958 --> 01:27:42,750
- [John] You need to relax.
- [Gonker whines]

1544
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,958
Yuri was much better at this than you are.

1545
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:47,750
Stick your head inside the jacket.

1546
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,000
Inside the jacket.

1547
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:53,458
- We're gonna get in so much trouble.
- No, I know.

1548
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,833
Come on.

Hey, what are you guys doing here?

1552
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:08,583
We brought you a sleep aid.

1553
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:11,208
Gonker?

1554
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,125
- Oh, my God.
- [Ginny] Good boy. [laughs]

1555
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:26,625
- [uplifting music playing]
- [laughs] Hey! Hey, boy!

1556
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:30,333
Hey, buddy.

1557
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:33,833
Hi.

1558
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:38,750
You're so tired. Yeah.

1559
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,708
You wanna go to sleep?

1560
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:48,416
- [tranquil music playing]
- Good boy.
