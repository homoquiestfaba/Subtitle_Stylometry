Havana, 1979

2
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,274
Couldn't we have gone elsewhere?

3
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,370
The place doesn't matter, Vivian.

4
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,983
It's like we've come here
to do something wrong.

5
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,945
We already discussed that.

6
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,955
Yes, but...

7
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,857
bringing me to a cheap motel
with holes in the walls!

8
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,897
There are no holes, love.

9
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,383
It's so hot!
I'm taking my shirt off.

10
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,644
Take off your blouse.

11
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,348
Turn off the light.

12
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,679
I have to go to the bathroom.

13
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,935
You invite me to the movies
but it was really for this!

14
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,780
I love you, Vivian.

15
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,215
And you show your love
by bringing me to this place?

16
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,787
All you want is sex,
like all men.

17
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,159
I want you, not sex.

18
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,808
I'll prove it to you.

19
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,211
I won't touch you
until we're married.

20
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,585
And in a five-star hotel.

21
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,792
Get dressed, we're leaving.

22
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,521
What?

23
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:18,697
STRAWBERRYAND CHOCOLATE

24
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,299
Vivian! Vivian is coming!
My God, she is beautiful.

After reading articles 24-28...

29
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,441
do you still want to marry?

30
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,812
Yes.

May I?

36
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,977
I couldn't resist the temptation.

37
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,773
I love strawberry!

38
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,156
It's the one good thing
made in Cuba.

39
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,465
Soon they'll export it,
and for us, water and sugar.

40
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,770
Today is my lucky day!

41
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,744
I'm finding wonderful things.

42
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,346
Fly on the wings of imagination.

43
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,652
It's the only way we can.

44
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,257
I've got le <i>Cahier du Cinéma.</i>

45
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,103
Interested in Vargas Llosa?

46
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,632
He signed this for me
but I have another copy at home.

47
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,111
I've also got the works
of Severo Sarduy and Gaytisolo.

48
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,910
Shall we go get them?

49
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,577
I don't visit strangers.

50
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,086
Don't pass this up, honey.

51
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,281
Where else would you find
these books?

52
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,688
Got it!

53
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,031
You only read books authorized
by the Youth League!

54
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,594
Cover them, friend...

55
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,435
Be imaginative!

56
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,670
I don't have to.
I'll read what I please...

57
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,374
and I don't feel like talking.

58
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,178
I know you.

59
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,713
I've seen you many times
leaving the University.

60
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,219
It wasn't me.

61
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,152
Of course it was you!

62
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,382
It wasn't!

63
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,722
Excuse me!

64
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,625
Comrade Torvald.

65
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,988
I just wanted
to lend you some books...

66
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,126
and give you a photo
of you from "A Doll's House."

67
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,669
Pictures of me?

68
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:49,299
Nora and Torvald...
You were wonderful.

69
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,004
- And those pictures?
- From the play.

70
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,309
I'm a photographer; I have many.

71
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,372
Everyone who sees them goes crazy.

72
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,111
So give them to me!

73
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,983
If you want them, they're yours.

74
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:02,918
Where are they?

75
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,047
In my apartment.

76
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,716
I live close by.

77
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,626
With my parents, nephews
and aunts, who never go out.

78
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,768
Okay, let's go,
but I want them all!

79
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,295
Let me finish my ice cream.

80
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,548
Ready!

81
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,946
Hold these.

82
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,357
- You'll pay for both?
- Yes. Keep the change.

83
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,368
Come, sweetie, you can't leave
without your photos.

84
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,170
Get out, sweetie! We are packed
like sardines back here.

85
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,025
What now?

86
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,263
One thing...
Don't get the wrong idea.

87
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,702
What do you mean, baby?

88
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,449
<i>They say you want me dead</i>

89
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,615
<i>For harming your reputation</i>

90
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,822
Who is she?

91
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,090
The Neighborhood Vigilance.

92
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,496
- So what?
- I don't like her.

93
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,698
Welcome to my hideaway.

94
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,180
Not everybody is welcome here.

95
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,842
Come right in.

96
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,287
Don't be afraid.

97
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,687
These sculptures...

98
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,089
are great.

99
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,494
Made by a young artist, Germán.
He is very talented.

100
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,895
We're having a show...

101
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,433
that will be a success...

102
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,934
although we still need
a few things...

103
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,494
that I'm getting
from a friend at an embassy.

104
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,307
Where is everybody?

105
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,778
Mom!

106
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,475
Dad! Aunt Chucha!

107
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,282
Twins!

108
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,646
They must be out
lining up for food.

109
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,756
Suit yourself.

110
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,887
That way we'll make it easier
for the neighbors.

111
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,555
I'll make tea to relax us.

112
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,533
No! I don't drink tea.
Give me the photos.

113
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,933
The photos?

114
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,268
Yes, but I have to find them...

115
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,773
Last time I saw them...

116
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,308
I think they're in this box!

117
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,881
You check while I make some tea.

118
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,078
I can't be rude
to such an important guest.

119
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,088
Make yourself at home.
Sit in this armchair.

120
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,124
It's special.

121
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,421
Rocco, you're dripping again!

122
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,727
Dummy!

123
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,461
Rocco, I'm getting tired of this!

124
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,991
You didn't find them?

125
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:43,160
Don't worry, we'll look for them
in that other box.

126
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,702
Do you take lemon?

127
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,567
No tea.
I don't have a stomachache.

128
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,201
Forget it and get my photos.
I must be somewhere at 5:00.

129
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,541
Then I'll give you coffee!

130
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,515
Civilized people drink tea,
but not us.

131
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,178
We prefer coffee.

132
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:10,559
<i>All us blacks drink coffee</i>

133
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:24,675
Make yourself at home, friend.
Sit in the armchair; it's special.

134
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,576
When I read John Donne
or Cavafis, I sit there.

135
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,580
Wonderful poets.
Heard of them?

136
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,017
How can a country move forward...

137
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,488
if its youth don't know
John Donne or Cavafis! Here...

138
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm always leading them
to young people.

139
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,097
You can be next.

140
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,368
I'll put on some music
so the neighbors can't hear us.

141
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,271
I learned it from the Vigilance
woman who got it from Security.

142
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,103
Let them listen.

143
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,483
God, what a voice!

144
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,881
Why can't this island
produce a voice like that?

145
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,053
We need another voice so badly!

146
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,424
We've had enough of Maria Remolá!

147
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,795
<i>Come out, neighbors.!</i>

148
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,034
<i>Onions have finally arrived</i>
<i>to the market</i>

149
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,843
Onions have arrived?

150
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,420
No.

151
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,858
I'm sorry!
I thought Dieguito was alone...

152
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,861
since the door was open.

153
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,298
Who was it?

154
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,097
The Vigilance woman.

155
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,665
What did I tell you...

156
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,839
Those aren't yours.

157
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,910
Well, give me mine.

158
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,383
First, the coffee.

159
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,549
Sit down, kid.
Don't worry, I won't bite.

160
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,228
I'm sorry!
My God! Did I burn you?

161
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,824
I'm so embarrassed!
How could that happen?

162
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,924
Let me see.

163
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,731
Hurry, take off your shirt.
It'll come out.

164
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,830
- Get me a wet cloth.
- No, take off your shirt!

165
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,001
How embarrassing!
It was so quick that...

166
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,638
- Give me something to put on.
- Sure.

167
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,981
Take this.

168
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,284
Why did this happen to me?

169
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,119
My brand-new shirt!

170
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,922
Look, not a trace of a stain.

171
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,055
I'm sorry.

172
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,754
I know...
I'll make it up to you.

173
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,137
Try this tea.

174
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,378
It's from India.

175
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,446
Dostoyevski's characters
drank tea...

176
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,391
and the English, of course.

177
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,985
At 5:00, all of England...

178
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,328
sits down to tea.
What time is it?

179
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,393
5:00. See, I told you
I had to be somewhere.

180
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,301
This is magic!

181
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,937
Try it and tell me.

182
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,775
So?

183
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,408
It needs more sugar.

184
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,477
That would be criminal.
Try it again.

185
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,390
It's all right.
I'll drink it.

186
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,396
But please,
give me the photos.

187
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,897
The photos...

188
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:26,140
I can't find anything here.

189
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,339
I'll look for them, and give
them to you some other day.

190
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,905
Some other day?
No way.

191
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,583
A promise is a promise.

192
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,948
Isn't it wonderful?

193
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,153
People out there
pushing each other on buses...

194
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,598
everyone shouting,
and you and I here...

195
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,134
listening to Maria Callas...

196
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:28,866
and drinking Indian tea
from French china...

197
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,500
that belonged
to the Laynaz del Castillos.

198
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:38,680
Well, look, I don't have time
to sit here talking nonsense.

199
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,481
Forget the photos, get my shirt.
I'm leaving.

200
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,748
You're right.

201
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,814
Let's talk about
more serious things.

202
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,623
Do you know Oscar Wilde?
Gide? Lorca?

203
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,185
Yes.

204
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,824
They all had something
in common with me.

205
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,836
But not only them.
The list is endless, dear.

206
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:03,398
Even the bravest
and most famous warriors like...

207
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,342
Alexander the Great, Hercules.

208
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,504
Achilles was Patroclo's boyfriend!

209
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,480
And some even say...

210
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,542
that Hemingway...

211
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:18,180
Yes, the guy with the shotguns,
hunting lions.

212
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,315
By the way...

213
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:25,094
A Marxist book on sexuality...

214
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,960
claims... very interesting...

215
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,195
that 60 percent of men...

216
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,736
have had
a homosexual relationship...

217
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,795
with no change in personality.

218
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,809
A. Raskolnikov.

219
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:43,041
If they say so,
it must be true, right?

220
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,584
I'm in the other 40 percent.

221
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,621
The best is not to be shocked
by anything...

222
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,990
and sip from every cup.

223
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,565
Here's how I became a fag.

224
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,070
Wait! I don't have
to listen to this!

225
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,664
Wait, dear,
you didn't understand me at all!

226
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,732
Why are you acting like that?

227
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,013
Hey, kid.
What's this?

228
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,209
You have the wrong idea!

229
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,751
What about the photos?

230
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,380
David, your Vargas Llosa book!

231
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,254
David, the book!

232
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,191
Fuck!

233
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,965
You let me open my mouth
and talk like a parrot!

234
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:46,769
Bring him back
or you'll live on bread and water!

235
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,042
And you, I hope
the coast guard gets hold of you!

236
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,631
What's wrong with you?

237
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,531
Listen to this.

238
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,839
I was having an ice cream...

239
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,175
and this guy comes
and sits at my table.

240
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,839
A weird guy.

241
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,439
Weird?

242
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,508
A faggot, man.

243
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,555
How did you know?

244
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,613
You can tell right away...

245
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,182
There was chocolate,
he took strawberry.

246
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,591
That's a good one.

247
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:40,324
He also started talking very
ironically about the Revolution.

248
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,127
And you let him?

249
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,132
Well, I was suspicious.

250
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,832
So I let him sit and talk
all he wanted.

251
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,034
And then?

252
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,474
He invited me home.

253
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,375
To his place?

254
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,471
David, he wanted something else!

255
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,812
Shit, man, this is serious!

256
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,908
He showed me some foreign books...

257
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,851
you can't find anywhere.

258
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,082
He used them as bait...

259
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,589
And you went?

260
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,455
To see if he was into something.

261
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,490
His place
is full of weird things...

262
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,828
strange sculptures...

263
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,891
I don't know, there's
something fishy about them.

264
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,301
They seemed religious.

265
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,863
Religious?

266
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,431
His friend made them...

267
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,239
and they are planning
an exhibit with help...

268
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,078
- from an embassy.
- An embassy?

269
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,310
Shit, that's really serious.

270
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,382
Do you have his address?

271
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,288
Could you find the place?

272
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,349
Sure.

273
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,223
<i>Miguel is right.</i>

274
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,060
<i>What do these fags think?</i>

275
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,693
<i>The embassy thing is serious.</i>

276
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,930
<i>This one picked the wrong guy.</i>

277
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,611
<i>Sex.!</i>

278
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,055
<i>Everybody...</i>

279
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,115
<i>thinks about sex all the time...</i>

280
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,660
<i>as if it were</i>
<i>the only important thing.</i>

281
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,528
<i>Sex.!</i>

282
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,891
<i>Vivian too.</i>

283
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,631
<i>She pretended to be romantic...</i>

284
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,442
<i>very spiritual...</i>

285
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,969
<i>but deep down,</i>
<i>that's all she wanted.</i>

286
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,283
Hey, Vivian!

287
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,911
What a coincidence!

288
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,719
Coincidence?

289
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,489
You were following me.

290
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,025
Come on... come on!

291
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,971
David, I want to live well,
have a family, dress nice.

292
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,841
And I want to do it now...

293
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,676
not when I'm too old!

294
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,151
You never loved me.

295
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,618
You just played with me.

296
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,163
You can't love that man.

297
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,208
Don't feel so sorry for yourself.

298
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,437
You'll find someone
better than me.

299
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,809
I don't want that!

300
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,312
See?

301
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,851
See what I mean?

302
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,879
You're not the only one
who suffers.

303
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,654
You think it's easy for me
knowing you're so nearby?

304
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,366
My husband is being sent to Italy.

305
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,610
For at least two years...

306
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,178
maybe three.

307
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,243
We're going soon.

308
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,327
I've been thinking...

309
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,762
Before I leave...

310
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,096
- Maybe we...
- I don't want to be your lover!

311
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,369
And don't pity me!

312
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,475
And I won't follow you
or go by your house ever again!

313
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,793
David!

314
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,170
What's up?

315
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,035
I checked on your case.

316
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,096
What case?

317
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,473
What?
About the fag.

318
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,707
Forget it.
It's no big deal.

319
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,239
Are you crazy?
What you said was right.

320
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,183
- Find out more.
- Like what?

321
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,849
Everything!
The embassy, the exhibit.

322
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,860
Find an excuse
to go and visit him.

323
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,830
- Why? He's just a faggot!
- Exactly.

324
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,095
This is important.
It's a mission!

325
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,597
The man's unfaithful
even to his own sex!

326
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,856
David!

327
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,324
Come on in.

328
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,225
I came because...
I left a book here the other day.

329
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,324
Yes, but please come in.

330
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,205
Are the sculptures still here?

331
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,837
Yes.

332
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,040
When is the exhibit?

333
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,276
Soon. We're already into it.

334
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,081
Well, make yourself at home.

335
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,385
Sit down.
I'll start making tea.

336
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,586
Okay? I'll be right back.

337
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,461
I'll sit in the chair...
What was the poet's name?

338
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,123
John Donne.

339
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,807
Remember, I'm next in line
to read it.

340
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,071
Where's he from?

341
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,443
England.

342
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,072
A friend of yours?

343
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,844
Friend?

344
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,544
Do you write to each other?

345
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,018
He died in 1630.

346
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,626
Don't be embarrassed.

347
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,685
You can't know everything.

348
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,555
I owe you an apology.

349
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,114
You don't owe me anything.

350
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,423
I should apologize to you.
I'd had a bad day!

351
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,626
I was being silly.

352
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,859
I don't know what came over me.

353
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:33,165
I got nervous.
I don't know.

354
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,602
I don't...

355
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,835
I'm not really like that.

356
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,935
I believe in friendship.
I think we can be friends.

357
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,345
Me too.
Friendship!

358
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,814
Not anything else.

359
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,985
Then this deserves more than tea.

360
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,393
Will you toast
with the enemy's drink?

361
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,801
Why not?

362
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,209
I'll get some ice.

363
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,877
Rocco, what's that water?
You're so stupid!

364
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,989
I'm getting tired of you!

365
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,218
I should throw you
over the balcony.

366
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,336
How do you get the whisky?

367
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,311
First, the "orishas."

368
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,264
Couldn't this affect you
ideologically?

369
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,597
- If one has firm principles...
- Well said.

370
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,934
A toast to this meeting.

371
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,269
I'll put on some music.

372
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,470
Your dad?

373
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,012
Who?

374
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,604
The one with the cigar.

375
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,883
You're so funny!

376
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,789
That's Lezama, the maestro.

377
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,021
One of the great writers
of this century.

378
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,222
A universal Cuban.

379
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,842
What a piano that man plays!

380
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,751
Where's he from?

381
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,310
Obsessed with nationalities!

382
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,650
A Cuban, Lecuona.

383
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,575
Look, David...

384
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,776
let's put our cards on the table.

385
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,248
Well, you know...

386
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,115
what I am...
I'm also religious.

387
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,380
I'm a dialectic materialist,
so why talk about it?

388
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,755
Today you seem different.

389
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:20,558
No, this is the way I am.
The other day I wasn't myself.

390
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,461
But there's more.

391
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,867
I've had problems with the system.

392
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,138
Like what?

393
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,134
Imagine, all sorts.

394
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,737
The neighbors watch me,
I don't do voluntary work.

395
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,611
They're after me at work.

396
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,450
Well, I think...

397
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,752
we all have the right to do
what we want with our lives.

398
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,928
The Revolution needs
more militants like you.

399
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,058
I'll show you
Communists are not savages.

400
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,104
That sounds marvelous.

401
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,280
I have a favor to ask you.
Not because of me...

402
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,155
but you know how people are.

403
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,156
I can come here...

404
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,486
but...

405
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,959
Got it.

406
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,553
If I see you on the street,
I don't know you.

407
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,571
And...

408
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,170
I'd rather you call me David...

409
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,839
not my "love," "baby"
or anything, just...

410
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,774
David!

411
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,323
This deserves
another toast, David.

412
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,556
We're giving humanity a lesson
with the whisky of the enemy.

413
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,130
Long live democratic communism!

414
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,782
You'll see, you'll feel better now.

415
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,853
Next time, take soda with it.

416
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,950
If he's got whisky,
he's got soda also.

417
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,793
Hey, you're getting
a nice fat ass! No wonder!

418
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,797
The whisky clue is good.

419
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,901
It's supplied by foreigners.
That's clear.

420
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,608
- And this is pure poison.
- He's religious.

421
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,151
He doesn't do voluntary work.

422
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:59,212
I think he's even had problems
with the police.

423
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,555
This is not a police issue.

424
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,390
It's political and moral.

425
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,761
See how I was right?

426
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,266
What about the exhibit?

427
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,929
Nothing. I ask him
but he won't say anything.

428
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,631
You must get it out of him!

429
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,003
It's not easy.

430
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,269
He's smart.

431
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,005
- He even knows I write.
- Great!

432
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,341
Use it.

433
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,010
I won't show him my writings.

434
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:30,144
Fuck, David,
getting him is what matters!

435
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,937
Watch her hands!
Watch it!

436
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,380
Come with me!

437
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,719
Wait, not so many!

438
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,817
Please, he's her brother
and I'm her husband.

439
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,522
Get in!

440
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:54,434
If I were to commit suicide
every time I had a problem...

441
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:01,572
Sorry I can't donate more blood;
she's run me dry.

442
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,676
When we're finished we'll go home
and I'll make you a steak.

443
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,983
She'll go to the psychiatrist
even if I have to drag her.

444
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,761
You still like her?

445
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,061
No, but I can't forgive her
for these things.

446
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,000
One day I'll have a heart attack.

447
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,665
She's charming,
but when she gets depressed...

448
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,603
- Does she have family?
- In the country.

449
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,205
This is about the fifth time.
I don't call them anymore.

450
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,486
David, I'm so grateful!

451
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,614
It was my duty.

452
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,784
She's a comrade...
and a Vigilance.

453
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,794
I donated blood for Tashkent.

454
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,330
Enough.

455
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,424
She doesn't deserve all this talk.

456
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,835
I can't eat all this.

457
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,101
I'll wrap it up for you.
Then you can take it to your dorm.

458
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:08,736
If you think this is a lot,
wait for the lunch a la Lezama.

459
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,144
How so?

460
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:15,279
You'll love it, you little beast.

461
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,353
I mean... David.

462
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,193
Tea constipates you.

463
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:33,794
Yes, that's why
nobody shits in England.

464
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,107
Look at this!
Rocco, dripping again?

465
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,272
I can't stand you!

466
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,809
He works when he feels like it.

467
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,548
Tell me.

468
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:55,114
Why study Political Science
if you like literature?

469
00:44:56,393 --> 00:45:00,693
I think one should study
what society needs most.

470
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,322
And I'm in the University...

471
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,991
thanks to the Revolution.

472
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,765
Comrade,
vocation must be respected.

473
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,434
David, you're fighting yourself!

474
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,240
I have a friend
who had talent for the piano...

475
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:22,115
but his father was against it,
arguing art is for gays.

476
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:27,522
Today he's 60, he's a queer
and can't play the piano.

477
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,659
A smile on this unlucky day!

478
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,458
Sorry, David...

479
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,662
but you have
such a beautiful smile!

480
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,202
Don't worry.
I can keep my promises.

481
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,799
What's your sign?

482
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,712
- Virgo.
- Virgo?

483
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,181
Wonderful for a writer!

484
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:57,751
I'm Scorpio.
We're not as bad as they say.

485
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,517
And Rocco is Leo.
Listen to him.

486
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,790
Diego, Dieguito!

487
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,690
It's me.

488
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,098
I just left the hospital.

489
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,533
Let's go to the beach.

490
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:49,333
- Forget it, I'm pissed off!
- Why?

491
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:52,432
I'm sick of these stupid
bureaucrats. We have no say.

492
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,806
But what happened?

493
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,970
They banned Germán's exhibit...

494
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,243
and you can't argue
since they control everything!

495
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,343
Bring me some water, please.

496
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,323
They only accept naive painters
or official ones...

497
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,953
or those pretending to be modern,
that are purely decorative.

498
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,997
Look, you like it?

499
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,055
Just bring me some water.

500
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,998
Don't take it out on me...

501
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,536
I'm in treatment.

502
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,901
Don't be like that.

503
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,532
How do you want me to be?

504
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,701
You want me to laugh?

505
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,301
I didn't keep quiet.

506
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,744
- What did you say?
- What I felt like saying.

507
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,442
There's no freedom in socialism,
bureaucracies...

508
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,680
Don't say that
without music, Diego!

509
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,051
And all for these sculptures...

510
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,214
What?

511
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,758
These sculptures are weird,
depressing.

512
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,521
They don't transmit good feeling.

513
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,085
You too now.

514
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,757
What a revolution!

515
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,823
Even whores are art critics!

516
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,835
Don't call me that
or I'll jump.

517
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,200
I'm not a whore!

518
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,100
Come, jump!

519
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,401
You need a push?

520
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,379
Look, sweetie...

521
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,780
Art makes you feel and think.

522
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,284
Art does not transmit.

523
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,480
The government radio does that.

524
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,618
You are too trusting.

525
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:21,027
Germán doesn't deserve it.
He's a son of a bitch!

526
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,592
That thinking will lead
to a nightmare.

527
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,432
There will be danger everywhere.

528
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,768
Next they'll ban children's songs.

529
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,364
Children's songs?

530
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,533
Heard this one?

531
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,909
<i>Things are frightening</i>
<i>Really horrible</i>

532
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,278
Oh, God.
I'll make some tea.

533
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,125
Hey, poet!

534
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,660
You're hard to find, man.

535
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,931
I've been busy studying.

536
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,338
Hey, I found out about the faggot.

537
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,640
The exhibit could be considered
ideological propaganda...

538
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,407
especially with foreigners' help.

539
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,608
At least 10-15 years in jail.

540
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,777
They're crazy!

541
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,320
They're not even having
the exhibit...

542
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,253
and I'm not going back there!

543
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,626
Are you being recruited
by that faggot?

544
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,325
Nobody recruits me but me!

545
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,194
- How beautiful!
- Cool it, let's go.

546
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,762
You're so controlling!

547
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,603
Don't be such a queen.

548
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,143
Does this gallery owner
know about art?

549
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,679
Well, he likes what I do...

550
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,681
but he had some comments.

551
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:50,152
He thinks this isn't
the right moment...

552
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,154
for some of the pieces.

553
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,383
What do you mean?

554
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,449
That we have to take some out?

555
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,226
We must be realistic.

556
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,459
Like he said,
better some than none.

557
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,329
Please, try to understand.

558
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,165
Germán, I won't argue anymore.

559
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:10,638
We've fought hard for the exhibit!

560
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,301
We can't sell out
for a trip to Mexico.

561
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:17,905
All the pieces must go!
You hear me?

562
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,848
Otherwise,
we'll put it up in the street.

563
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,279
Now leave, I'm expecting company.

564
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,522
I hope your new comrade...

565
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,895
helps you get
your feet on the ground.

566
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,456
You hear?

567
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,862
Okay.

568
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,636
- Dye and deodorant.
- Forty.

569
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,676
Next week,
pantyhose and children's shoes.

570
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,650
I'll come by.

571
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,087
Don't look at me like that.

572
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,890
I'm not abusing anyone.

573
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,691
Look, it's all high quality.

574
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,594
I'm the one taking a chance
with the police.

575
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,364
Besides, it's my business.

576
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,406
I can't live on candles like you.

577
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:20,432
If they want the good stuff,
they'll have to pay for it!

578
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,978
And that's enough, leave me alone.

579
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:52,774
Are you okay?

580
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,105
What do you think?

581
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,436
I wanted to thank you.

582
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,976
Come and have coffee
or coconut dessert.

583
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,928
I really enjoy life.

584
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,597
There's no reason to kill myself.

585
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,140
It really was an accident.

586
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,768
With a knife, peeling potatoes.

587
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,674
Both wrists?

588
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,647
It was double-edged.

589
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,212
I'm glad you're okay then.

590
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,882
Of course I'm okay.
I have your blood.

591
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,653
- Diego said you tried...
- Don't believe him.

592
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,285
He's a liar.

593
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:49,563
But he was so caring and scared.

594
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,897
He needs me alive.

595
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,926
Are you close friends?

596
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,907
I'm in the League...

597
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,910
but he's getting me some books.

598
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,311
The Communist League?
I better put on some music.

599
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,111
Since you're Vigilance here...

600
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,913
I wanted to ask you...

601
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:12,284
What's Diego like,
you know, politically?

602
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,290
- You shouldn't visit him.
- Why?

603
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,327
It's not good for you.

604
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,659
He's a great person,
a wonderful guy.

605
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,721
I love him like a brother.

606
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,461
Nancy, do you have my scissors?

607
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,867
Diego!
We were just talking about you!

608
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,838
You were? Hey...

609
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,932
I didn't know you were here.
I was waiting for you.

610
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,103
Well, thanks for the coffee.

611
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,708
Thanks for checking on me, David.

612
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,453
Stay away from him, you slut!

613
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,334
What sad music.

614
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,069
Of course it is.
It was composed by...

615
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,809
Ignacio Cervantes
when he had to leave Cuba...

616
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:18,115
or rather,
when the Spaniards kicked him out.

617
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,383
That's why it's called...

618
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,288
"Farewell to Cuba."

619
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,220
This one is called...

620
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,820
"Los Illusions."

621
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,836
Damn it.
Why are you like that?

622
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,462
Like what?

623
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,034
Do you have family?

624
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,941
I didn't come out of nowhere.

625
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,673
For sure they rejected you.

626
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,580
No, I'm Mom's favorite son.

627
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:26,054
But your father
didn't care for you and left you?

628
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,059
Dad's a saint.

629
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:36,622
I was taught not to speak
with my mouth full.

630
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,796
I have his eyes.
Thank God, because...

631
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,430
Mom's a saint,
but she looks like a toad.

632
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,565
Then what happened?

633
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,703
- Why are you...?
- A fag? Because.

634
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,178
And my family knows.

635
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,150
It's their fault.

636
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,242
Who says?

637
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,083
Why not take you to a doctor?
It's in the glands.

638
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,751
Please, David!

639
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,123
What a theory...

640
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,323
coming from a University student.

641
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,059
You like women...

642
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,431
and I like men.

643
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,129
It's perfectly normal.

644
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,401
Since the beginning of time.

645
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,941
I'm still decent...

646
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:19,997
and patriotic.

647
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,407
But not revolutionary.

648
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,570
Who says I'm not?

649
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,021
I've had illusions too, David.

650
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,389
When I was 14, I volunteered
for the Literacy Campaign.

651
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,522
I picked coffee in the mountains.

652
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,622
I wanted to become a teacher...

653
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,326
and what happened?

654
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,838
This is a thinking head
but if you don't always say yes...

655
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,806
or you think differently,
you're ostracized.

656
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:55,140
What ideas are you talking about?

657
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,112
Setting up exhibits
with those horrible pieces?

658
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,149
- What do you believe in?
- Cuba.

659
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,446
So do I.

660
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,851
So that people know
what's good about it.

661
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,785
I don't want Americans
or anybody...

662
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,087
coming here telling us what to do!

663
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,220
All right.
But with your posturing...

664
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,355
nobody can take you seriously.

665
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,297
Yes, you've read
all those books...

666
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,994
but all you think of is men.

667
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,300
I think about men
when I need it...

668
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,534
like you do about women!

669
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:32,805
And I don't posture
and I'm not a clown.

670
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:36,147
Of course, to you,
anyone different is.

671
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:40,383
Because a guy on a street corner
saying "Hey, man, what's up?"...

672
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,890
is normal to you.

673
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,391
But I am not.

674
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,362
To accept me,
they have to say I'm sick.

675
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,125
Fuck it, I'm not!

676
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,433
Go ahead...

677
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,164
laugh at me...

678
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,708
I laugh at you too.

679
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,576
I'm part of this country,
like it or not!

680
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,945
And I have the right
to work for its future.

681
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,543
I'm not leaving Cuba
even if they burn my ass!

682
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,613
Without me, you're missing
a piece, you stupid shit!

683
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,556
- Dieguito!
- Keep the fucking scissors!

684
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,636
Now, please leave.

685
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,276
If you don't want me
to burn you up...

686
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,503
make him come back!

687
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,460
Be reasonable
or I won't go to Mexico...

688
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,125
and you know I want to!

689
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:08,398
Are you an artist or a tourist?

690
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,872
You know
I'm more of an artist than you!

691
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,772
What's more, I did this alone.

692
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,243
I'm not kidding!
Leave that.

693
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,212
They are mine!

694
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,307
Give me that!
The show must be complete!

695
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,885
I can't stand you!

696
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,581
You're crazy, damn it!

697
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,220
This is definitely over!

698
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,453
Of course, it's over!

699
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,459
The sculptures are mine!

700
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,737
Always...

701
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,822
Hello.

702
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,981
Shit! What happened here?

703
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,040
You don't want to know.

704
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,020
You wrote these?

705
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,082
Look, they're some
of the first things I've written.

706
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,956
They're just drafts.

707
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,464
I have better things
but I can't find them.

708
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,829
- Give them to me.
- Don't show anyone.

709
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,629
I promise.

710
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:23,331
A friend typed it,
so any misspellings...

711
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,703
Give them to me.

712
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,242
What's important is the content.

713
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,902
The rest is irrelevant.

714
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:32,038
I'll read it tonight.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

715
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,482
We'll see if you deserve
the lunch a la Lezama.

716
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,385
- Did you like the Zenea.
- Yes, I have it right here.

717
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:42,947
It's amazing Cubans
wrote like that in the 1800s.

718
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,993
I'll put it right here.

719
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:57,929
What are you doing, dear?

720
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,372
Don't be rude.

721
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,774
Wait until I show it to you.

722
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,072
Who's this to?

723
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:06,638
A gallery director,
with many copies sent.

724
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:07,876
What for?

725
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,111
To tell him a few things...

726
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,484
he needs to be told.

727
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,489
They rejected the exhibit again?

728
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,219
Worse than that.
They <i>bought</i> him.

729
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,767
Well, it's for the best.

730
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,137
It would have meant trouble
for you.

731
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,303
Thanks.

732
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:39,644
But they'll be stunned
when they receive my letter.

733
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:43,242
When will they understand
that art is one thing...

734
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,980
and propaganda another?

735
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:46,988
If they don't want to think...

736
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,685
there's TV, newspapers,
radio and the rest.

737
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,024
Somebody has to tell them.

738
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,325
- But why you?
- Why not?

739
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,298
He's taken a wrong road...

740
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:01,530
the exhibit, the communist kid.

741
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,970
You know I feel things.

742
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,075
Help him. You won't regret it.

743
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,023
<i>The weak submit...</i>

744
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,091
<i>while the strong go forward.</i>

745
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:37,003
<i>This is a task for the strong.</i>
<i>José Marti.</i>

746
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,883
Well...

747
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,387
How are things
back at the commune?

748
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,281
Why do you say that?

749
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,055
Because of this.

750
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,289
It's no good?

751
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,562
It's just not literature.
No life in it.

752
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,194
Only slogans.

753
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,537
You only forgot the proper term
for "former" is "muzhik."

754
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,408
You didn't like any of them.

755
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,709
Not even the one
about the strikers?

756
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,214
That's the worst.

757
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:24,276
Where did you hear that sugar
subsidy was in Machado's time?

758
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,689
The spelling mistakes and typos...

759
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,988
made by your typist friend
are in red.

760
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,754
It looks like measles.

761
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,016
But don't feel bad, dear.

762
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,323
You have talent.

763
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:08,087
Among all the rubbish
are some nuggets of pure gold.

764
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,358
Think so?

765
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,724
Of course.

766
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,668
And you've found
the right teacher.

767
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,330
I mean...

768
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,465
if you accept me as a tutor.

769
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,540
All right.

770
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,375
But one condition:

771
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,847
Forget the exhibit,
don't send the letter.

772
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,183
Bye-bye, exhibit.

773
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,091
We live in one of the world's
most beautiful cities.

774
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,761
You can still enjoy it...

775
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,390
before it collapses in shit.

776
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,799
Don't be unfair,
there are too many things...

777
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,235
They're letting it collapse,
you know it!

778
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,504
We're small and struggling.

779
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:56,341
But it doesn't pain them
to see the city this way.

780
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,880
Some care.
You and I care.

781
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,583
Aren't they Cubans?

782
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,693
Look, Diego...

783
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,928
you can't judge the Revolution...

784
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,265
through <i>your</i> experience.

785
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,535
Look at me, I study
in the University and who am I?

786
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,870
A peasant's son.

787
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:08,807
Like Stalin.

788
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:09,845
Seriously...

789
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:13,143
all we want
is to be independent...

790
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,546
to do whatever we want.

791
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,778
They can't stand it,
same as you...

792
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,285
but as a nation.

793
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:21,289
Understood.

794
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,688
It's a whole campaign.

795
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:29,220
Hungary in 1956,
Czechoslovakia in '68, Stalin.

796
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,925
How does it concern us?

797
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,991
World War II was in 1945.

798
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,797
Stalin died in 1953.

799
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,394
I wasn't even born yet.

800
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:38,099
Americans should be reminded...

801
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,234
that Truman Capote
dropped the "A" bomb.

802
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,403
Harry Truman, rather.

803
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,913
Truman Capote never; he was gay.

804
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,949
Don't justify Stalin with Truman.

805
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:52,113
It's sad, mistakes happen
like sending Pablo Milanés...

806
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,179
to the UMAP camps.

807
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,746
There were many more.

808
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,689
That's over now!

809
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,955
Only the famous ones were freed.

810
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,587
Is that a way to educate us?

811
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,757
That's part of revolution...

812
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:07,928
but not <i>the</i> Revolution!
Understand?

813
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,995
Yes, but who pays
for these mistakes?

814
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,870
Who'll speak for them?

815
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:16,173
Someday there'll be
more understanding for everyone.

816
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,270
That's why it's a revolution.

817
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,016
So...

818
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,677
Communism will make us fags happy?

819
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,421
Yes, homosexuals
and non-homosexuals.

820
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,455
So someday I'll be able
to show any exhibit I want?

821
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,598
And I could say hello
to you in public?

822
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,063
I once had those hopes, David.

823
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,142
But it won't come from heaven.

824
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,178
We must fight...

825
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,873
especially with ourselves.

826
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,973
But until then...

827
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,615
at least
inside these four walls...

828
01:10:58,287 --> 01:10:59,618
give me a hug?

829
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:03,215
Why does it always
come down to the same thing?

830
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:06,887
You want me to respect you
as you are, but you won't...

831
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,827
do the same for me.

832
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:14,093
It's not a matter of men,
homosexuals or...

833
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,001
I just need it so!

834
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,066
I'm afraid.

835
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,281
What's wrong?

836
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,182
Tell me...

837
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:32,777
I'm your friend.

838
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,854
<i>Militarily and politically...</i>

839
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:44,296
<i>defeated by the Sandinistas,</i>
<i>Somoza flees to the U.S.</i>

840
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:50,068
<i>Somoza's dynasty was one of the</i>
<i>most brutal tyrannies in America.</i>

841
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,085
Where were you?

842
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,218
What's it to you?

843
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,523
So you didn't want to deal
with the fag?

844
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,064
The fag's name is Diego.

845
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,997
Diego?

846
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,968
He's no longer the fag,
now he's Diego.

847
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:25,432
He has more guts and principles
than you think.

848
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,804
You don't say!

849
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,740
So, he's no longer
a counterrevolutionary.

850
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,369
You set him straight?

851
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,274
I can imagine how.

852
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:39,210
Miguel, try to understand!

853
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,085
We must give him a chance.

854
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,386
Yeah? What's this?

855
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,257
French communism, Prague spring?

856
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,956
Look, David, right there...

857
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,158
90 miles away, is the enemy!

858
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,134
And the weak and the critics
are on that side.

859
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:58,401
But we're here,
so why can't he be revolutionary?

860
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,533
'Cause it wasn't
rammed up his ass!

861
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,647
Somebody wants you downstairs.

862
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,665
Will you write me?

863
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:41,970
What's wrong with him?

864
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,204
It's been hours.

865
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:46,076
He even asked for a drink
when he came in.

866
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,287
Oh, Diego, he's so cute!

867
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,526
Just like a man of the '40s!

868
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:06,164
What's wrong
with paying compliments?

869
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,468
- I wanted to ask you for a favor.
- Go ahead.

870
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,714
Get me a bottle of whisky.

871
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,847
I finally sold your watch.

872
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,616
I didn't get much for it but...

873
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,781
Better than nothing.

874
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:33,419
That makes 300 dollars total.
Count it, please.

875
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:37,625
Forget it, honey,
that was one hell of a favor.

876
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:42,693
I can't sell anything else for
you now. It's bad on the street.

877
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,706
- How was the meeting?
- Well, they got my letter...

878
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,106
They didn't even let me speak.
They fired me.

879
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,610
I can't work
in any cultural agency.

880
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:52,374
What will you do now?

881
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,146
I won't let them get me.

882
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,516
I have a surprise for them.

883
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,384
Diego!

884
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,658
I got the interview
with the embassy!

885
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,193
That's great!

886
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,026
But, Diego...

887
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,401
Keep this
in case they search here.

888
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,670
That serious?

889
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,837
You shouldn't have sent
those letters.

890
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,479
This is for a present for David.

891
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:32,077
What?
You'll need hard currency, honey.

892
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,418
He needs clothes
for the lunch a la Lezama.

893
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:37,822
That's at least 100 dollars!
You're crazy!

894
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,588
He deserves it.

895
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,288
He's talented and works hard.

896
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:44,526
Sure. Germán too
and look at what he did!

897
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,363
But he has it!

898
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,063
To be an artist
one needs more than talent!

899
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:52,662
By the way.

900
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:57,337
Don't tell him anything,
not even a hint.

901
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,643
I'll tell him I asked
for a leave of absence.

902
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,415
He shouldn't come so often...

903
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,547
being a communist and all.

904
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,115
One day he'll realize that.

905
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,821
You're very interested
in my dumping him.

906
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,056
Me? Why?

907
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,860
To pick him up.

908
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,998
I've seen you looking at him.

909
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,593
Okay, I'm leaving.

910
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,003
<i>Water that you mustn't drink</i>

911
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,640
If you go to jail,
that's your problem.

912
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,146
The favor has to do with him.

913
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,149
He's never gone to bed
with a woman.

914
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,345
So?

915
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,354
Why don't you initiate him?

916
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,158
How dare you!

917
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,560
Who do you think I am?

918
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:52,566
- Forgive me, you're wrong.
- I'm no whore!

919
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,864
You've misunderstood me!

920
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,769
I understand perfectly!
Let him fuck a fish!

921
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,636
And don't count on me anymore!

922
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,703
Please, let me explain!

923
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,871
Don't explain anything.

924
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,654
You have a better idea?

925
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,320
So I like the boy.
So what?

926
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,350
<i>Lonely spirit...</i>

927
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,720
<i>get into David Alvarez's heart...</i>

928
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:27,160
<i>Don't let any woman,</i>
<i>black, white, Chinese or mulatto...</i>

929
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:30,221
<i>be with him.</i>
<i>Tie him to me.</i>

930
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:34,667
<i>I'll drink his heart's blood</i>
<i>and take his heart from him.</i>

931
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,897
<i>Make him come to my feet...</i>

932
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:41,568
<i>like our Lord Jesus came</i>
<i>to Pontius Pilate's feet.</i>

933
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:30,418
Oh, sweet Virgin!

934
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,124
Help me control myself!

935
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,760
And don't tell your pal
at my place.

936
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,970
- What am I doing here?
- You're not here.

937
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,668
It's a dream.

938
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,404
You're dreaming about me.

939
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,046
And Diego?

940
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:31,745
Why include Diego in this dream?

941
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,152
He left.

942
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,714
He asked me to feed you
and take you out.

943
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:42,659
- Take me out?
- Yes, take you out.

944
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,221
Well, do it.

945
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:52,568
- Aren't they pretty?
- Beautiful.

946
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,506
I'm always giving myself flowers.

947
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,342
When I'm happy and when I'm sad.

948
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,811
You were dead yesterday.

949
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,944
But alive today.

950
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:07,818
That's dialectics.

951
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,685
What do you want
to know about me?

952
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,630
Your family, anything.

953
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,565
They live in Cabaiguán,
I was born there.

954
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,568
Look how pretty the sea is.

955
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,497
When is your birthday?

956
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,735
I'm Pisces, and you?
No, don't tell me.

957
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:29,933
You're Virgo.

958
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:32,639
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

959
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:37,211
Virgo men and Pisces women
get along very well.

960
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,980
- Where do you work?
- Let me see your hand!

961
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:44,423
- The left or the right?
- The right.

962
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:46,153
The left
is what you are born with.

963
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,218
The right,
what you achieve in life.

964
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,399
What do you see?

965
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,697
Your intelligence line.

966
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,202
Look, very deep.

967
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,730
This is your love life.

968
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,709
I see a love ending here...

969
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:07,674
another beginning suddenly
that drives you crazy.

970
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,686
- The ferry! Let's go.
- Okay.

971
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,822
Well...

972
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:52,960
This is it.

973
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:56,896
We had a very beautiful day...

974
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,763
although you have talked
very little.

975
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,563
I've had a nice time.

976
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:04,537
I was feeling bad
but today I feel better.

977
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:09,471
May I come in?

978
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:11,704
It's too late.

979
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:12,838
Come on!

980
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,142
No, no, no.

981
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,113
See you tomorrow.

982
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:19,411
Good night.

983
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:37,931
Santa Barbara,
don't let me screw up!

984
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:40,698
Nancy...

985
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:43,039
Nancy, I know you're home.

986
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,908
I didn't mean to offend you.

987
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,446
Open up.

988
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,642
I did myself in
and left a note blaming you.

989
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,981
Don't do anything crazy!

990
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,955
Nancy, look, I feel bad
and I don't want to be alone.

991
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,719
Get your little friend then.

992
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,688
I brought you some rice pudding.

993
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:19,177
- I'm going to do it.
- What?

994
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,747
Go to bed with David.

995
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:25,582
Forget I asked you to do that.
I really want you to change.

996
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:28,349
I won't do it because you asked.

997
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,948
I want him to learn
about love through me.

998
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,255
Are you in love with him?

999
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,695
Handsome, we have recreated...

1000
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:40,029
the banquet
that Dona Augusta gives...

1001
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:42,569
in the pages of <i>Paradise.</i>

1002
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:47,597
The most glorious novel
ever written on this island.

1003
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:50,769
Chapter 7, Cuban edition.

1004
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,580
Now, you will soon belong...

1005
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:56,913
to the fraternity
of Lezama's worshippers.

1006
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:00,953
Once you read it,
you too will understand.

1007
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,117
It's a gift.

1008
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:07,059
A first edition,
signed by its author.

1009
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,069
A toast.

1010
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:21,837
To the "lazy shrimp
and flaming baroque!"

1011
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,708
No, seriously.
To friendship.

1012
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,807
- And to love.
- Yes, love!

1013
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:46,365
- I'm leaving. It's late.
- What do you mean?

1014
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,631
Diego, don't go, please.

1015
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,002
I have an appointment,
I'm sorry.

1016
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:56,605
I'll leave this with you.
Have a good time.

1017
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:58,646
Have you got your passport?

1018
01:26:58,713 --> 01:26:59,941
What passport?

1019
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:04,246
No, his I.D. card.
That's what he calls it.

1020
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,247
Listen to this.
I was saving it for you.

1021
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:14,526
Give me a drink?

1022
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:34,941
Behave! And if you want
to misbehave, wait for me.

1023
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,821
Listen to that!

1024
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,460
Let's dance...

1025
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:49,757
Come on.

1026
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,378
I want to kiss you.

1027
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,559
Where do these stairs go?

1028
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,874
What do they say, Godfather?

1029
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:24,717
My life?

1030
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,520
My age?

1031
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:30,384
Age doesn't exclude love.

1032
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:32,484
My past?

1033
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:34,751
I'll explain...

1034
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:38,257
and he'll understand.

1035
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,163
He'll know...

1036
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:42,168
there's something clean
inside me...

1037
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:44,670
that nobody can dirty.

1038
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,673
That's what I offer him...

1039
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,868
you know it.

1040
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,146
Don't take him away.

1041
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,578
Don't let her take him away.

1042
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:05,325
Diego, right?

1043
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,795
I'm a friend of David.

1044
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:16,762
May I come in?

1045
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:19,196
Come in.

1046
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,265
These are for Diego.

1047
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:57,009
Aren't they pretty?

1048
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,908
And look, for you.

1049
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,814
Kick him out of college?

1050
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:10,517
Do you know
what you're asking me?

1051
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:12,149
Take it easy.

1052
01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:14,888
Don't get nervous.
It isn't about you.

1053
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:16,896
It's better if you sign this.

1054
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:18,659
I told you I won't sign anything!

1055
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:20,325
And please leave!

1056
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,531
Hey, keep it down.

1057
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:28,939
- I know what you're doing.
- I do what I feel like doing!

1058
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,441
And I told you to leave!

1059
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:34,208
A scandal would ruin you.

1060
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,773
Do you think
I'm afraid of scandals?

1061
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,948
You want a scandal?

1062
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:45,015
David is forty times
the man you are!

1063
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:46,719
Look how he defends his man!

1064
01:32:46,794 --> 01:32:48,955
Man, my ass, you faggot!

1065
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,826
I've had it!

1066
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,293
Take it easy, girl.

1067
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:58,096
What's going on here?

1068
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,535
Let me go, David!

1069
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:04,138
This won't end here!

1070
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:07,009
I wanted to catch you
bringing flowers to your lady.

1071
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,314
- This is not over, you hear?
- What's not over?

1072
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,251
You're both faggots.

1073
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:17,418
You'll pay for this, David.

1074
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:16,547
I thought things
had to be clear between us.

1075
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:20,852
Why were you in a diplomatic car?

1076
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:27,187
I'm leaving the country.

1077
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:31,023
Oh, yes?

1078
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:40,964
What are you doing?

1079
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:43,806
Not because I want to;
they're kicking me out.

1080
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:46,142
Who is?

1081
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:47,578
The exhibit...

1082
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:49,878
the letter I sent...
All that got too far.

1083
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,679
Nobody is kicked out for that.

1084
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,447
No? Look.

1085
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,754
Do you think that
with these reports in my record...

1086
01:34:58,826 --> 01:35:01,226
someone will give me a job?

1087
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,763
Only in agriculture
or construction.

1088
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,800
And what do I do
with a brick in my hand, what?

1089
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:13,332
I thought I could speak out...

1090
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:14,601
but no.

1091
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:19,076
You people decide
what is "revolutionary."

1092
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:20,613
You can't leave!

1093
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,047
You'll have
the same problems there.

1094
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:28,047
Do you think I'm leaving
because I want to?

1095
01:35:28,122 --> 01:35:31,091
Can't you see I have no options?
No other choice!

1096
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:38,490
I have only one life, David.

1097
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,057
And I want to do things...

1098
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:43,126
make plans, like everybody else.

1099
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:47,305
Be what I am, damn it!

1100
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:49,638
Why shouldn't I have that right?

1101
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:51,942
Let me try it...

1102
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:53,502
at least.

1103
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:31,650
Isn't it wonderful?

1104
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:41,286
Let me have a good look.

1105
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:44,024
It's my last chance.

1106
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:47,964
Why the last?

1107
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,016
Do you know
what my enemies call me?

1108
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,977
The Red Queer...

1109
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:09,045
because I've spent
so much time with you.

1110
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:14,125
Others think you recruited me...

1111
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:17,164
that I'm actually a Mata Hari
going to Europe.

1112
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,457
So, how did you become a fag?

1113
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:22,866
Are you crazy?

1114
01:37:22,937 --> 01:37:24,905
If you knew you'd freak.

1115
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,371
You tell me...

1116
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,069
What was your first time like?

1117
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:31,873
You can't fool me.

1118
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:36,474
The face of an angel,
but a devil in bed, I bet!

1119
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,745
- If you only knew.
- Go on, tell me.

1120
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:41,820
You won't believe this.

1121
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:43,413
My first time was with Nancy.

1122
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:45,754
No! Impossible.

1123
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:47,953
Such an attractive guy!

1124
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:51,657
- Guess where?
- At Nancy's, right?

1125
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:53,461
At the hideaway, in your bed!

1126
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,627
Shame on you two!

1127
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,774
- And what will you do now?
- About what?

1128
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:11,110
Nancy.

1129
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,788
I like her a lot.

1130
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:19,624
Nancy is a little sparrow.

1131
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:21,991
She seems strong and bright.

1132
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:23,393
But she's a sparrow...

1133
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:25,659
that anybody can hurt.

1134
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,032
Nobody will.

1135
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:31,560
She's with me.

1136
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:41,270
If you knew how delicious
a woman can be.

1137
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:44,474
How disgusting!

1138
01:39:15,816 --> 01:39:17,943
It's the only good thing
they make here!

1139
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,747
A strawberry!

1140
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:24,347
Today is my lucky day!

1141
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:25,551
Anybody want one?

1142
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:29,922
You're so beautiful.

1143
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:32,295
The only problem is
you're not gay.

1144
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:36,331
Nobody's perfect.

1145
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,921
I'm not as noble as you think.

1146
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:14,171
When we met in Coppelia,
I was with Germán.

1147
01:40:18,145 --> 01:40:20,773
And I bet him
I'd get you into bed.

1148
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:27,581
Spilling the coffee on you
was part of the plan.

1149
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:31,146
Your shirt outside
signalled victory.

1150
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:37,357
Then Germán spread the word.

1151
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,930
And I didn't say anything...

1152
01:40:42,002 --> 01:40:44,562
because I liked
being associated with you.

1153
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:54,538
I didn't realize I could harm you.

1154
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,114
That's why...

1155
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:04,047
That's why I asked
for a hug so often.

1156
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:08,891
I thought hugging you...

1157
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:10,930
would make me feel cleaner.

1158
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:25,569
I love you very much, David.

1159
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,208
What can I do?

1160
01:41:50,616 --> 01:41:53,208
