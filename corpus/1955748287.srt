1
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,968
<i>Death of a legend.</i>

2
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,103
<i>It is with sorrow</i>

3
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,305
<i>that the country learned
this week</i>

4
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,708
<i>of the death
of aristide leonides.</i>

5
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,644
<i>Born in 1871,</i>

6
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,946
<i>he arrived from Greece,
aged 23,</i>

7
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,948
<i>without a penny
in his pocket,</i>

8
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,917
<i>and opened his first restaurant
that same year.</i>

9
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,288
<i>The first hotel was ready
for business not long after.</i>

10
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,024
<i>His first wife,
lady marcia de haviland,</i>

11
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,025
<i>died young.</i>

12
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,194
<i>But Mr. leonides wasn't alone
at the end.</i>

13
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:19,865
<i>He is survived by his young
and lovely American widow,</i>

14
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,599
<i>Brenda.</i>

15
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,567
<i>Here is Mr. leonides</i>

16
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,703
<i>with his eldest granddaughter,
Sophia.</i>

17
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,704
<i>Friend or foe,</i>

18
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,974
<i>no one could dispute
aristide leonides</i>

19
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,076
<i>was a colossus of his time.</i>

20
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,584
Good morning, miss ackroyd.

21
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,686
Good morning, Mr. hayward.
Mr. hayward.

22
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,187
Yes?
We have a client.

23
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,056
She's waiting inside.

24
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,793
She?
Wouldn't give a name.

25
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,495
Hello.

26
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,932
Hello, Charles.

27
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,796
I'm sorry to surprise you
like this.

28
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,565
But I wasn't sure
you'd agree to see me.

29
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:33,972
I'm really very sorry to hear
your news, miss leonides.

30
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,608
I wanted to be incognito
in Egypt.

31
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,946
I was surprised
when you left the diplomatic...

32
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,749
For this.
Detection?

33
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,183
It's a family business.

34
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,654
What exactly
can I do for you, Sophia?

35
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,857
I believe
my grandfather was murdered.

36
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,625
Murdered?

37
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,993
He died of a heart attack.

38
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,828
But I suspect foul play.

39
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,264
And what makes you
suspect that?

40
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,632
I found him.

41
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,502
And the doctor
was acting oddly and...

42
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,270
He wouldn't sign
the death certificate,

43
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,739
and there's going to be
a postmortem.

44
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,908
Right.
I want you,

45
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,078
Charles, to come down
to the house

46
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,079
and look into it for me.

47
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,081
Before the police
get involved.

48
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,382
For a fee of course.

49
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,719
Heh. It would be
a little unethical for me

50
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,154
to take this case, Sophia.

51
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,955
I'm sure
you can understand that.

52
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,491
You want to know why I left?
No. I...

53
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,960
I didn't want you to become
involved with my family.

54
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,562
Oh, the penniless
junior diplomat

55
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,431
not quite what they had
in mind for you.

56
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,632
Yet, now you do want me
don't...

57
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,133
to become involved
in your family?

58
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,869
Now things are different.
Very different indeed.

59
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,738
Not for me.

60
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,076
I believe the killer
may still be in the house.

61
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,513
I'm frightened, Charles.

62
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,982
You, frightened?

63
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,317
Yes.

64
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,487
Well, then you should go
straight to the police.

65
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,825
Miss ackroyd, miss leonides
will be leaving now.

66
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,804
You should at least think
about it.

67
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,988
Miss leonides.

68
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,790
You've met her before?

69
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,191
Briefly, in Cairo.

70
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,626
Oh, come on, Mr. hayward.

71
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,362
Just think of
the publicity.

72
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,732
You can't afford
to refuse this job.

73
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:45,604
What exactly is your interest
in the leonides death, Charles?

74
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,774
I've been approached
by a member of the family.

75
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,276
I don't know what you think
you're playing at

76
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,411
with this gumshoe business.

77
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,180
You should be here at the yard,
like your father.

78
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,481
A hard act to follow.

79
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,116
You can say that again.

80
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,251
What do you want?

81
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,653
The examining doctor noticed

82
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,122
the extreme contractions
of the pupils.

83
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,391
He ran some tests
and concluded

84
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,528
the cause of his death
was eserine.

85
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,295
It's, uh...

86
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,764
Also known as
physostigmine.

87
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,500
Used in eye drops
to treat glaucoma

88
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:21,306
or, if injected directly
into the blood stream,

89
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,974
would cause a heart attack.

90
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,945
Your father used to lean forward
like that.

91
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,216
Leonides
was a diabetic.

92
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,853
It's possible the eserine
was switched with his Insulin.

93
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,555
Were the eye drops his?
Yes.

94
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,758
So the switch could have
just been an accident.

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,693
Could have been.
There's not much of a case.

96
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,196
And the family lawyers
would tear us apart

97
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,864
if we tried to make one.

98
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,832
What about the press?

99
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,633
Once the yard
breathes "murder,"

100
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,734
the press
will be all over it.

101
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,471
And these people relish
their privacy

102
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,140
as much as they relish
their money.

103
00:07:55,775 --> 00:08:00,312
This member of the family,
he or she?

104
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,913
She.

105
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,582
Above suspicion?

106
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,286
All right. Two days.
Then I call in the hounds.

107
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,122
Look, I haven't decided
to take the case yet.

108
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,591
Then what are you doing
here?

109
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,760
I don't see why a family
like this would talk to me.

110
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,797
Open the gates even.
I have no authority. I...

111
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,633
leonides had a lot
of powerful friends.

112
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,201
He also had
powerful enemies.

113
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:27,772
He was a controversial
figure.

114
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,377
Take all these notes
to your office, think about it,

115
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,579
<i>wait for my call.</i>

116
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,270
Thank you, Charles.

117
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,274
For what?
Hmm.

118
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,644
For taking me dancing
tonight.

119
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,197
Charles hayward.

120
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,931
Is everything all right?

121
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,333
Do you know anything
about moles?

122
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,636
No. I'm afraid not.

123
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,271
I have an arsenal
of other weapons, of course.

124
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,973
Traps, poisons.

125
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,041
Sometimes I use Holly.

126
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,011
It pricks them, do you see,
makes them bleed.

127
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,545
Moles are hemophiliacs.

128
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,747
Little bleeders.

129
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,848
Like
some European royals.

130
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,853
Though I do find a shotgun
best expresses my feelings.

131
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,288
Are you Sophia's sleuth?

132
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,958
Yes. Charles hayward.

133
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,459
I'm sorry,
the gates were open...

134
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,762
yes, we were expecting you.

135
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,030
Edith de haviland.

136
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,400
My late sister
was aristide's first wife.

137
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,002
Sophia believes
there's a borgia

138
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,772
living under this roof.

139
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:14,906
How dramatic.

140
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,775
Josephine!

141
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,079
Josephine!

142
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,781
Josephine!

143
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,382
Josephine,
nanny's calling you!

144
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:28,219
Come along!
All right, aunt Edith!

145
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,289
Come along now,
there's a good girl.

146
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,026
Come on.

147
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,795
Get off of me.

148
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,530
Go on.

149
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,801
I don't know what we'd do
without our old nannies.

150
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,002
Faithful.

151
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:47,105
I chose this one myself
years ago.

152
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,040
Hello, Charles.

153
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,176
Sophia.

154
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,511
How do you two
know one another?

155
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,446
We met in Egypt,

156
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,148
when I was out there
with sotheby's.

157
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,416
He saved my life.

158
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,617
Didn't you,
Charles?

159
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,454
Well, her horse bolted
on the way to the pyramids.

160
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,322
I managed to stop it.

161
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,356
Pfft.

162
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,692
I'm sorry?

163
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:11,162
Sophia has never been
run away with in her life.

164
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,766
By a horse or anything else,
come to that.

165
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,735
Charles likes to think
he rescued me.

166
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,805
Oh, the dear boy.

167
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,487
Aunt Edith came
to nurse grandmama,

168
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,855
and, when she died,

169
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,190
considered it her duty
to help bring up the boys.

170
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,627
Save them
from grandpapa's influence.

171
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,162
They fought like
cat and dog,

172
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,197
aunt Edith and grandpapa.

173
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,899
She told him
he was a slimy foreigner

174
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,968
with his fingers in the till,
and he told her

175
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,105
she was a narrow-minded,
xenophobic snob.

176
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:58,143
Actually, I think
she secretly adored him.

177
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,713
Here's the man himself.

178
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,381
I know what you're thinking.

179
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,016
The gorgeous daughter
of an Earl

180
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:09,220
and a near midget immigrant,
an unlikely match.

181
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,321
But granny fell for him.

182
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,224
There was something exotic
and vibrant about him

183
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,492
that appealed to her.

184
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,827
Was the marriage happy?

185
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,995
Very happy.

186
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,763
Of course,
their respective friends

187
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,566
didn't mix, and her parents
couldn't stand him.

188
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,169
Well, then
why didn't they stop it?

189
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,871
Nobody could stop grandpapa,
Charles.

190
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,250
This is where
you found him?

191
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,553
Can you walk me through it?

192
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,923
I brought him up
breakfast.

193
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,559
Was that usual?

194
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,295
<i>Yes.</i>

195
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,863
Morning, grandpapa.

196
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,598
He liked me to do it.

197
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
And why was that?

198
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,637
We had a... Special bond.

199
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,339
<i>Grandpapa.</i>

200
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,580
<i>Special bond? How do you mean?</i>

201
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,647
Nothing.

202
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,284
We just got along well,
that's all.

203
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,054
This was his bathroom.

204
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,025
And that's the fatal
cupboard.

205
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,393
And through there?

206
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,728
His wife's room.

207
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,830
Brenda.
Yes.

208
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,532
Huh.

209
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,336
In my office, you said...

210
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,206
Well, you said
you were frightened.

211
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,510
We're a very odd family,
Charles.

212
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,312
There's lots
of ruthlessness in us

213
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,583
and different kinds
of ruthlessness.

214
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,886
That's what's
so disturbing.

215
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,488
The different kinds.

216
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,224
What do you mean?
Exactly what I said.

217
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,027
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

218
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,229
Yes, thank you,
Sophia.

219
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,653
Are you the detective?

220
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:25,089
Ah, you must be Josephine.

221
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,024
Sophia's sister.

222
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,960
How do you do?
I'm very well, thank you.

223
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,895
So you find out
people's secrets?

224
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,298
That's the idea.

225
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,466
Is that your tree house
out there?

226
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,768
Mine and eustace's.

227
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,503
He's my older brother.

228
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,471
I like your notebook.

229
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,708
What do you write in it?
The things that I know.

230
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,976
I know lots of things.

231
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,177
And now
that my grandpa's dead,

232
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,147
I am by far the cleverest person
in this house.

233
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,049
Anything you'd like
to tell me?

234
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:51,916
Not yet.

235
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,152
You see,
i read detective stories.

236
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,087
And a good detective
will take the time

237
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,389
to gather evidence
and question everyone

238
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,424
before solving a case.

239
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,359
Because the murderer
is never the one

240
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,527
you initially suspect.

241
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,330
Magda is ready for you now.
Magda?

242
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,398
She doesn't like me
calling her "mommy."

243
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,200
She says it ages her.

244
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,339
There's no place like home.

245
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,374
Oh, these shoes are all wrong.

246
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,876
Much too frivolous
for the occasion.

247
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,878
I apologize,
Mr. hayward.

248
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,879
No.

249
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,214
Oh, god.

250
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:26,351
I drank far too much claret
last night.

251
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,352
Gives me headaches.

252
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,420
Burgundy suits me
so much better.

253
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,323
Well, perhaps you should take
an aspirin.

254
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,891
Aspirin?

255
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:34,659
Pah! Hmpf!

256
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,329
Hair of the dog, darling.
Yeah.

257
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,032
Cure evil with evil.

258
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,038
And what about you?

259
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,540
It's a little early
for me, I think.

260
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,076
You're
cute.

261
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,979
Wait till you have
three children.

262
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,483
So...

263
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,417
You're
an actress?

264
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,753
Clearly, you've never
set foot in a theater,

265
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,121
otherwise
you'd know my work.

266
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:07,025
I must admit
I'm more of a cinema enthusiast.

267
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:07,925
I see.

268
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,428
I never cared much
for the movies myself.

269
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,732
Although,
i do have a superb script.

270
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,868
My husband wrote it for me.

271
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,902
<i>Exposure.</i>

272
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,771
His first work of fiction.

273
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,805
Full of passion.

274
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,307
<i>The lead character, moi,</i>

275
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,109
is a wonderfully dark part.

276
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:30,181
I know they say I should always
play comedy because of my nose.

277
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,816
Well, I suppose
this murder

278
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:36,287
would give us a lot
of advance publicity and...

279
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,592
Do go on.

280
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,928
Is any of this
really of any importance?

281
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,331
I mean, after all,
we have our very own Ruth Ellis

282
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,000
right under this roof.

283
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:52,403
Ruth Ellis shot her lover,
not her husband.

284
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,441
Well, either way,
she was hanged for it.

285
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,742
And rightly so.

286
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,576
But are you saying

287
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,380
you'd like to see
Brenda leonides hanged?

288
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:06,684
You are twisting my words.

289
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,823
Yes, well... perhaps I should
have a word with your husband?

290
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:12,890
He's in the library.

291
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,926
Thank you so much
for your time.

292
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,296
Is that all?
For today, yes.

293
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,600
Good. I'm starving.
Hm.

294
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,137
I hope
I'm not interrupting.

295
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,207
Charles, let me introduce you
to my father,

296
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,741
Philip leonides.

297
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,709
It is a pleasure

298
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,878
to meet you, sir.
Charles hayward.

299
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,113
I knew a hayward once.

300
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,681
Assistant commissioner
of Scotland yard.

301
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,783
Something of a legend
in the force.

302
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,585
- My father.
- Hmm.

303
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,520
Did rather well for himself.

304
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,355
Until he was murdered.

305
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,424
And they never found out
who did it?

306
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,327
No.
Not much of a recommendation.

307
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,261
Father.

308
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,864
Mr. leonides...

309
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,301
As disagreeable as you may find
my visit to be,

310
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,404
I can guarantee that
it will pale in comparison

311
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,539
to what's in store for you

312
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,875
should the police decide
to come around again.

313
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,844
Can you make an effort now,
please?

314
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:07,578
For me?

315
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,180
Seems my lovely Sophia
is upset.

316
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:13,351
We must reach some sort
of accommodation, Mr. hayward.

317
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,888
Are you suggesting
that we let the roll of a die

318
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,855
decide for us?

319
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,159
It will determine whether or not
we continue this conversation.

320
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,994
Pick a number.
Will you two please stop it?

321
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,164
Mr. leonides, please...
I'll assign you four.

322
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,467
Of course,
the odds are against you.

323
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,437
And I'm not going to answer
your questions anyway.

324
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,274
Ah, well, that would be
very bad form, sir.

325
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,675
Do you think
some illegal pressure

326
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,310
from some little man
at Scotland yard

327
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:44,348
is going to make me talk to you?
I do. Yes.

328
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,850
Because that little man
and I

329
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,253
are trying to do you
a favor, sir.

330
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,061
Ah, the little notebook.
Of course.

331
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:57,695
Jot away.

332
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,599
You are the eldest son.
I am.

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,434
And how long
have you lived here?

334
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,303
Ten years ago
i lost a poker game

335
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,304
to the wrong people.

336
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,906
My father used it
as an opportunity

337
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,575
to keep me on a leash.

338
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,943
That's what drove us here.

339
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,277
Along with one or two bombs.

340
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,747
My father is referring
to some of my mother's plays,

341
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,049
which were
less than successful.

342
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,319
- Ah, yes.
- So you wrote her a screenplay.

343
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,720
I am an historian.

344
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,623
I write on medieval art
and literature.

345
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,792
This screenplay of my wife's
was...

346
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,728
Is a one-off.
Mm-hm.

347
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,663
She and I live for the arts.

348
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,698
So you play no part

349
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,367
in your father's
business operations?

350
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,868
Uncle Roger runs
associated catering,

351
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,404
my grandfather's
flagship company.

352
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,773
Yes, my little brother
is the man,

353
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,177
despite having the
business sense of a mongoose.

354
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,351
But you are not
in actual need of... Money?

355
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:56,254
No one in this house
is in actual need of money.

356
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,923
Why on earth
would you stay here?

357
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,360
Because that was the deal.
Besides,

358
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:06,964
who actually wants to work
for a living, Mr. hayward?

359
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,567
Has the will been read?

360
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,202
Not yet. Why?

361
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,771
I'd have expected it by now,
that's all.

362
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,139
Everyone knows what's in it.

363
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,608
I mean, we're all
very well provided for.

364
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,112
So no little clues
for you there, Mr. hayward.

365
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,382
Thank you, Mr. leonides.

366
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,852
Yes, one last thing.

367
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:28,619
If you must.

368
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,421
You don't seem at all sad,
sir.

369
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,023
I beg your pardon?

370
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,825
Your father is dead.

371
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,695
But you don't seem
remotely sad about it.

372
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,898
Goodbye, Mr. hayward.

373
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,523
A little man, Mr. hayward,
who cast a large shadow.

374
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:09,060
A very large
and rather crooked shadow.

375
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,261
Hm.

376
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,831
What are you doing?

377
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,499
Can't I play detective too?

378
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:20,071
You smell of cigar,
which means you've met Philip.

379
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,606
But you don't smell
of alcohol.

380
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,075
Is magda still asleep?

381
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,077
No. I met her.

382
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,146
So you actually declined
the drink she offered you.

383
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,948
Good boy.

384
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,416
Keeping a clear head.

385
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,618
Eyes on the prize.

386
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,588
No wonder Sophia likes you.

387
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,290
Lady Edith,

388
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,292
when might be a good time
for us to talk?

389
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:42,660
Oh, I'm busy.

390
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,195
Autumnal pruning.
Ah.

391
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:48,299
I'm a firm believer
in the benefits of deadheading.

392
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,167
In all seasons.

393
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,930
Clemency leonides.

394
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,633
Do feel free to come and go
as you please.

395
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,635
I'm sorry,
the door was open.

396
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:29,140
You're the private detective
Sophia hired, I suppose?

397
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,275
Charles
hayward.

398
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,843
Continuing our theme
of openness,

399
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,245
perhaps
you should be aware

400
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,982
that I am a senior
research chemist at la roche.

401
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,817
And...?
And my specialty

402
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,353
is plant toxicology,
Mr. hayward.

403
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:45,456
I know all there is to know
about poisons.

404
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,059
I don't suppose you ever bring
your work home with you, now?

405
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,063
Roger!

406
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,833
Sophia's detective is here.

407
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,368
So tell me,
how does it work?

408
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,137
All of you living
in this house together?

409
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,372
Who told you it works?

410
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,475
Mr. hayward.

411
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,943
Aunt Edith tells me
you know Sophia.

412
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,711
Yes,
we knew each other briefly

413
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,413
in Cairo.
No, no, that's good.

414
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,116
We think that's good, don't we,
clemmy? Anything to help

415
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,551
lock this slut away.
Darling.

416
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:16,654
I cannot believe she couldn't
wait. He was 86, for god's sake,

417
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,556
and she murdered him
in cold blood.

418
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,657
Roger, be quiet.

419
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,826
Yes, your wife is right, sir.
If you're not careful,

420
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,695
you may find yourself
facing an accusation of slander.

421
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,330
How can you defame
a murderess?

422
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,231
She made me an orphan.

423
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,366
You are 55 years old,
my love.

424
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,768
These things happen.

425
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,638
You're right.
I'm sorry.

426
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,974
No. No.
Please go on.

427
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,346
You are the managing director
of associated catering.

428
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,380
Your father's company.

429
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,449
One of his companies.
He gave it to me,

430
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,284
but you're quite right,
it is his.

431
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,719
Everything is,
really.

432
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,455
In my father's house
there are many mansions.

433
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,390
And the last time
you spoke to him?

434
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,326
We spoke all the time.
Why do you ask that?

435
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,460
It's a simple question.

436
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,795
What do you mean?
What does he mean?

437
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,197
Perhaps we could continue this
at a later date?

438
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,599
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

439
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,868
I'd like to strangle
that woman with my bare hands.

440
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,402
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

441
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,038
He hasn't had time to adjust.
She's a gold digger.

442
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,806
First to last.

443
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,075
And she poisoned
a defenseless old man!

444
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,110
Your husband
has a very sharp temper.

445
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,879
Oh, he'd never hurt a fly.

446
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,181
Loving your father
is quite natural, of course.

447
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,717
But this borders
on idolatry.

448
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,721
Being the favorite child
isn't all jam.

449
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,357
Ooh, let me give you a hand.
No, no.

450
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,691
Please.
I like to keep busy.

451
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:32,530
Especially now that the children
really don't need me anymore.

452
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,431
Or not for much longer.

453
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,635
That's the destiny of a nanny,
i suppose.

454
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:41,071
Are you the only member
of staff employed here?

455
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,742
Yeah. Pretty much me and cook
just now.

456
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,710
Because of
Mr. leonides' death.

457
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,812
They want to keep the house
quiet and private.

458
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:52,950
But the servants here
usually come and go anyway.

459
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,486
Who's that with Sophia?
Sorry.

460
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,688
That's Mr. brown, sir.

461
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,824
The children's tutor.
Ah.

462
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,961
Go gentle
with Mrs. leonides.

463
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:07,731
She's not as tough
as the rest.

464
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,219
May I come in?

465
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:33,090
Why, you're not
what I expected at all.

466
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,595
What have they all been saying
about me?

467
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:40,364
All of them down there?

468
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,236
Don't worry, I can guess.

469
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,873
Beasts.

470
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,775
So, what if I'm 37?

471
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,912
We married for love.
So, what's wrong with that?

472
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,481
They were born rich.

473
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,150
So they think
no one else is good enough.

474
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,620
How did you
and your husband meet?

475
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,255
I was a dancer in las Vegas.

476
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,057
Yes. Heh.

477
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,959
He had
some business there.

478
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,195
One day he walked
into the casino

479
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:12,129
where I was working.

480
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,199
And he saw me crying.

481
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,368
Please...

482
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,738
...don't think that crying
is my natural state.

483
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,338
No.

484
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,107
But I had gotten
into some trouble,

485
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,443
like a dreadful
little servant girl.

486
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,413
You mean pregnant?

487
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,183
I was tired of men.

488
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,353
I wanted a home.

489
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,525
I dreamed of someone nice
who would make a fuss over me.

490
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:45,129
Then he said, "sit down.
Tell me what's wrong."

491
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:46,964
I said, "i can't,

492
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:50,434
I'll get sacked
for sitting with a customer."

493
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:54,571
Then he said, "no, you won't.
I own the place.

494
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,074
Your husband owned a casino
in las Vegas?

495
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,543
Well,
it wasn't public knowledge.

496
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,211
He was more
of a silent partner, you know.

497
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:07,151
Your arrival here
must have caused quite a stir.

498
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:14,091
I vowed I would be
a really good wife, and I was.

499
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,761
But we could never get rid
of that family of his.

500
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:22,566
Always coming and sponging
and living in his pocket.

501
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,768
And what about the baby?

502
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,637
Turns out
there wasn't one after all.

503
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,273
It was all a mistake.

504
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,643
Did your husband have
any evening routines or...?

505
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:37,114
Well,
he liked a bit of television.

506
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,150
He would come in here,

507
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,186
this was his chair.

508
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,288
Sometimes I would
put on music,

509
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,090
and he would watch me dance.

510
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,425
He liked that a lot.

511
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,362
Some evenings
he worked straight through

512
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:56,867
with Mr. brown,
the kids' tutor.

513
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,403
They got along well.

514
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,007
What were they working on?

515
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,377
Aristide was writing
his memoirs.

516
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,445
Ah.

517
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:15,185
Now, I have a delicate question
for you, Mrs. leonides.

518
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,121
I wish you'd call me Brenda.

519
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,925
Um, the Insulin...
Yes?

520
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,195
Did your husband
inject himself?

521
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:29,199
Yes, but that night...

522
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,336
I did it.

523
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:33,604
He asked me to do it.

524
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:38,008
He was tired, he said,
and he asked me to.

525
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,942
All right.

526
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,348
Nanny says some of the family
suspect poison killed him.

527
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,650
Yes.

528
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,352
It is a possibility.

529
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,220
You see?

530
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,054
I killed him.

531
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,257
The police will find
my fingerprints

532
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,825
on the bottle
and the syringe.

533
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,796
But the bottle said Insulin,
not poison.

534
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,266
And if I was the murderer
i would have wiped them off,

535
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,801
wouldn't I?

536
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,836
Wouldn't I?

537
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,971
Sir.
Sit.

538
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,942
Do you know this woman?

539
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,277
Yes, Sophia de haviland.

540
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,345
She works at sotheby's.

541
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,082
She doesn't let anyone
near her. But rumor has it

542
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,453
that you two get along well.
Do you know who this man is?

543
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,754
It's aristide leonides.

544
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:02,893
Well, this woman's real name
is Sophia leonides.

545
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,428
His granddaughter.

546
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,632
I guess she forgot
to mention that, didn't she?

547
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,434
You see, we know for a fact

548
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,836
that leonides was in bed
with the CIA

549
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,638
since the Greek civil war.

550
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,806
And we don't know why.

551
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,576
And considering
all that's going on

552
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,044
in this country
at the moment,

553
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,113
we want to make sure
that her presence here,

554
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,617
and the fact that she's hiding
her true identity,

555
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,785
are just coincidence.

556
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,921
I'm sure
there's a good reason why...

557
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,890
look...

558
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,858
You're bored to death
in the embassy,

559
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,227
and you want to work
in intelligence, is that right?

560
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:42,165
Yes.
Then consider her your way in.

561
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,086
No, no, no...

562
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,355
I've been looking for you.

563
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,222
What are you doing here?

564
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,992
This is Mr...
...aristide leonides' study,

565
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:42,726
I know.

566
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:43,994
What are you doing here?

567
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,496
Mr. leonides gave me
access to it.

568
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,564
I can see that.

569
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,267
So you're this
private investigator

570
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,669
and you want to question me?
Yes.

571
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,404
I haven't met eustace yet.

572
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,007
What can you tell me
about him?

573
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,042
He's what they call now
a teenager.

574
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,845
Rebellious. Angry.

575
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,547
Despises authority.

576
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,482
Loves rock 'n' roll.

577
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,416
Thinks for himself too,

578
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,052
which is quite an achievement
in this house.

579
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:12,489
And he doesn't like
being tutored at home.

580
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,190
So why is he?

581
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,791
The reason
Mr. leonides gave

582
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,626
was his childhood palsy.

583
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,262
He would be bullied
for his limp.

584
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,364
But you don't think so?

585
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,966
Mr. leonides
was really controlling.

586
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,776
You were helping him
with his memoirs?

587
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,112
Yes, th...

588
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,580
that's highly confidential.

589
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:38,148
Were you working with him
that night?

590
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,985
Yes, we worked late.
Several interruptions.

591
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,421
Visitors?
Yes.

592
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,689
Roger first and then magda.

593
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,190
Do you know
what they wanted?

594
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,993
Well, neither of them
are especially discreet.

595
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,696
Roger was in some sort
of crisis about the business,

596
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,999
and magda wanted Mr. leonides
to finance her film.

597
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,701
<i>Ah, exposure.</i>

598
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,604
Did he agree to it?

599
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:01,238
No.

600
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,273
She does plays
that no one sees.

601
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,275
And her husband writes books
that no one reads.

602
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:08,478
What do these people know
about the real world anyway?

603
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,247
Anyone else visit
that night?

604
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,516
Sophia.

605
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,586
She's a little more discreet
than the others.

606
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,058
That's the house
where Mr. leonides was born.

607
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,133
I'd like to see a copy
of the memoirs.

608
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,234
There's only
the original.

609
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,937
Then the original
it will have to be.

610
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,575
It's gone missing.

611
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,815
There's only one thing
for you.

612
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,745
Does your tortoise
have a name?

613
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:18,748
<i>Salome. Mommy did a play
called salome.</i>

614
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,852
It wasn't a great success,
I'm afraid.

615
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:24,621
Salome danced
before king herod.

616
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,622
And he liked it so much

617
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,824
he said that she could have
whatever she wanted.

618
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,627
Are you done
with your interrogation?

619
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,096
Mm. For today.

620
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,865
Did you find many clues?

621
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,733
You know, Josephine,

622
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,502
the first round
of interrogation

623
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:41,938
is not so much
about finding clues,

624
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,543
as it is about getting a sense
of who you're dealing with.

625
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,478
You're lucky you're able
to talk to them.

626
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,448
As a family, we don't
actually talk that much.

627
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,616
Except magda,
of course.

628
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,885
But all she speaks about
is herself.

629
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,325
It must be very sad for you
to lose your grandfather.

630
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,828
Not really.
I didn't like him.

631
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,898
He stopped me from being
a ballet dancer.

632
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,599
He said I'd be no good.

633
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,968
And I really love ballet.

634
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,570
Sorry to hear that.

635
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,307
Josephine, what can you tell me
about Mr. brown?

636
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,343
Laurence is having an affair
with Brenda.

637
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,913
They write letters
to each other.

638
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,347
They're awfully soppy.

639
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,749
Laurence is soppy.

640
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,917
How do you know this?

641
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:27,717
"Oh, my darling,

642
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,221
I need you more than the air
that I breathe."

643
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,722
You're making this up,
aren't you?

644
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,858
I also know
where they're hidden.

645
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,093
I know lots of things.

646
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,695
I listen at doors.

647
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,298
People don't pay attention to me
in this house.

648
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,033
They're way too selfish
for that.

649
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,202
But I pay attention
to them.

650
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:47,304
Bye-bye, Mr. hayward.

651
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:48,672
Bye.

652
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,507
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

653
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:53,743
Closing in on your prey,
Mr. hayward?

654
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,011
Lady Edith.
Yes.

655
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,347
I was wondering,
are the gates

656
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,915
locked at night?
Religiously.

657
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,419
Aristide was a fervent believer
in the communist threat.

658
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:05,322
Personally I can't conceive
of swinley Dean

659
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:07,390
having a very active cell.

660
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,593
Unless of course
you count our Mr. brown.

661
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,228
He is an intellectual,
isn't he?

662
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,364
May I ask you
a blunt question?

663
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,399
They're the only
interesting kind.

664
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:20,770
What's wrong with people
in this house?

665
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,174
Heh.
It is a blunt question indeed.

666
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:27,110
Sorry.
Don't be.

667
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,578
Passion.

668
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,917
It is a hothouse
of suppressed passion.

669
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:34,718
This is what happens

670
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,655
when the person
you love the most in the world,

671
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,991
who you would give
your life for,

672
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:44,227
is actually the same person
that you hate the most.

673
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:47,664
I'm certain you understand,
Mr. hayward.

674
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:51,501
You wouldn't be in this house
yourself otherwise,

675
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,270
would you?

676
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:13,410
<i>Hello?</i>

677
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,713
Brent, it's Charles hayward.

678
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:20,850
<i>Charlie, what a surprise.</i>

679
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,787
<i>What can I do for you,
buddy?</i>

680
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,489
Aristide leonides.

681
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,057
<i>What about him?</i>

682
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,969
What are you doing here?

683
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,373
No, Charles.
The question is...

684
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:46,042
What are you doing now?

685
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,578
You're not scared, are you?

686
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,880
Not in the least.
You should be.

687
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,387
Off!

688
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:12,535
So you like it?

689
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,084
Let's go upstairs.

690
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,389
This is what my grandfather
wanted me

691
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,592
to keep him up to date on.

692
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,127
What the young people
were doing.

693
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,496
The music scene.

694
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,499
He believed that this
was the future for his business.

695
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,000
Leisure, entertainment.

696
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,435
I suppose
that's what he meant

697
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,804
by the whole world going soft
after the war.

698
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:51,107
So this is what Vegas
was about?

699
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:55,211
I suppose you don't want to talk
about his memoirs either?

700
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,182
You know,
i saw a picture of you.

701
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,884
As a ballerina.

702
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,086
That was when
i was a little girl,

703
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,121
before I injured my knee.

704
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:05,922
You were sweet.

705
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:10,159
Will you shut up
and light my bloody cigarette?

706
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,868
Charles. This little girl
feels like dancing.

707
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,973
Just like in Cairo.

708
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:01,738
<i>The last will and testament
of aristide leonides,</i>

709
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,774
<i>which was drawn up by me
and signed by him,</i>

710
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,976
in front
of all his family members,

711
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,812
on the 24th of July, 1957.

712
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,015
In it,
each and every one of them

713
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:17,220
is handsomely
and equitably provided for.

714
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:18,921
However, Mr. hayward,

715
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:22,659
miss leonides
has specifically instructed me

716
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:26,396
to give you
all the information you need.

717
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:27,397
But I hope I can rely

718
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:30,533
on your absolute discretion
here.

719
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:31,434
Of course.

720
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,336
Because, as I just told
the family,

721
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,506
we realized only this morning
that this will has no signature.

722
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:40,677
Everyone present,
myself included, saw him si...

723
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,479
or rather we thought
we saw him sign it.

724
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,315
But...
he died intestate?

725
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,684
So it would appear.

726
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:50,687
But if he died intestate,
then...

727
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,623
Then the primary beneficiary
of the will is,

728
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:57,860
of course,
the second Mrs. leonides.

729
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,262
Brenda.

730
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:00,263
Indeed.

731
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,842
Josephine!

732
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:18,081
Josephine!

733
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,570
Thank you.

734
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:41,804
Nice setup.

735
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:44,273
What do you want?

736
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,447
I know about the will.

737
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,084
And I also know
that you had a heated discussion

738
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,454
with your father
the night he died.

739
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,492
Now, a stab in the dark...

740
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:06,662
But might it have concerned
the imminent collapse

741
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,030
of associated catering?

742
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:11,534
You are an extremely
intrusive person, Mr. hayward.

743
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,936
I thought you could do
with some...

744
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,540
Now, what was it?

745
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,274
One last attempt

746
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,909
to get your father
to bail you out?

747
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:21,844
And he refused?

748
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,586
It's made out to
associated catering.

749
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,889
For £2 million.

750
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,559
Phew. This sort of money
would solve

751
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:37,894
most people's problems.

752
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:38,928
Not mine.

753
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,063
All I ever did
was let him down.

754
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:44,600
But he always forgave me
and bailed me out.

755
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:46,102
Again and again.

756
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,970
That night,

757
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,307
clemency told me
to destroy this check.

758
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,543
That it would be the end
of me if I were to accept

759
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:56,946
one more penny
from my father.

760
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,582
But I'm not as strong
as my wife.

761
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:02,418
The next morning...

762
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,588
He was dead.

763
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,107
There you are.

764
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,478
Don't creep up on people
like that.

765
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,883
People who eavesdrop seldom
hear good of themselves.

766
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:38,321
And put that horrid notebook
away.

767
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,148
Hello?

768
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,317
Buddy,
you're being followed.

769
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,619
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

770
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:10,920
<i>I thought it was you.</i>

771
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:13,356
Oh, you could never spot us
that easily.

772
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:14,924
So do you have anything
for me?

773
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:16,092
<i>Only if you tell me</i>

774
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:19,161
<i>why you left the foreign
office. You were promising.</i>

775
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:21,697
And the free world
needs people like you.

776
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,432
The free world.

777
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:24,433
Please.

778
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,235
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

779
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,970
<i>Leonides was a friend
of ours.</i>

780
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:32,408
But I don't think his death
has anything to do with that.

781
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,210
What was your business
with him?

782
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:36,178
He helped us in Greece
during the civil war.

783
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,382
Financed a bunch of
anti-communist organizations.

784
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:41,317
Mm-hm.
Gave money to the right people.

785
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:43,786
In return, we helped him out
in the states.

786
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:47,189
Helped him cover up
some of his shady businesses.

787
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,658
Which explains las Vegas.

788
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,793
He was a strange cat.

789
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:54,497
Saw himself as
the next Alexander the great

790
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:55,765
or something.

791
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,000
He had a thing for empires.

792
00:48:58,002 --> 00:49:00,269
And the British empire
is falling apart.

793
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,104
Every dog has his day.

794
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,005
And that's it?

795
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:05,574
Look. Everybody wants to know
who killed him,

796
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,343
and nobody has a damn clue.

797
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,545
But we're talking
about a lot of money here.

798
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:13,316
This guy was everywhere.
Like an octopus.

799
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,618
So who benefits
from his death?

800
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,353
It's just far too obvious.

801
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:21,390
Maybe your friend in the car
could help us.

802
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,435
Hi. I believe
we have a mutual friend.

803
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,903
Sorry?
Your wife.

804
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:35,271
What? What can...

805
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,707
hey.
Get off, get off, get off.

806
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,108
Aah!
Hey, calm down.

807
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,843
We just wanna know
who you are.

808
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:43,646
Hey, hey, hey. There we go.

809
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,047
Come on. Yeah.

810
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,983
Oh, boy.

811
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,384
Charles,

812
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:52,555
meet sergeant glover
of Scotland yard.

813
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,292
Ha-ha-ha.
Easy. Easy, big fella.

814
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:57,626
What on earth
were you thinking?

815
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,128
Charles,
it's not as bad as it looks.

816
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,064
I'd have thought, considering
your friendship with my father,

817
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:03,632
you'd have had more trust
in me than this.

818
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:07,136
I swore I'd look after you
should anything happen to him.

819
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,504
Seriously,
you're saying to me

820
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,340
that this clown of a man
was there to protect me?

821
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,776
- If anyone's the...
- shut up, glover.

822
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,344
He's right, you are a clown.

823
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,546
Now, get out of here.

824
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,318
Charles,
you have to understand,

825
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,786
I'm under
a lot of pressure here.

826
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:26,055
There's politics
involved here.

827
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,390
It's sensitive.

828
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,457
And with your past...

829
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:30,092
I'm sorry? My past?

830
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:31,127
In Cairo.

831
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:33,029
I was a diplomat.
Of course.

832
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,964
And I am a duchess.

833
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,766
Now, give me something,

834
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,168
so I can still have faith
in you.

835
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,736
All right.

836
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,905
Any one of them
could have done it.

837
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:46,642
They all had means.
They all had opportunity.

838
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,010
Motive?
Oh.

839
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:50,880
Anger, jealousy, love, greed.

840
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,648
Take your pick.

841
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,616
So no communist,

842
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:59,121
no las Vegas mafia,
no CIA conspiracy?

843
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:01,123
We're investigating too.

844
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:01,957
Quietly.

845
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:05,661
But you can go in the house
without a warrant.

846
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:06,996
Get back in there

847
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:10,699
and find out who killed
the bloody midget.

848
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,322
Brenda admits she gave
the fatal injection.

849
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:36,592
But anyone, anyone could have
swapped out those bottles.

850
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,626
Including her.

851
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:40,596
Yes, including him.
Tell me this.

852
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,531
How would Brenda have known
the consequences

853
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,867
of swapping over the Insulin
with the eye drops?

854
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,202
Oh, we all knew about that.

855
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:47,703
He made a point
of telling us about it

856
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,439
at his 86th birthday party.
He went into great detail

857
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,210
explaining how we could
do away with him.

858
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,545
Yes, he had a very twisted
sense of fun.

859
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,447
You met with him
the night he died?

860
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:02,618
Yes, he wanted to discuss
family matters.

861
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,620
Family was pretty much
everything to him.

862
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,956
Well, you can tell me
about Laurence brown then.

863
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,958
Did you know he was having
an affair with Brenda?

864
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,160
I suppose I knew something
might be going on.

865
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,462
And what if your grandfather
had found out?

866
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,431
I'm quite sure
he knew all about it.

867
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:16,999
And he didn't mind?

868
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,335
It's highly likely
that when he selected Laurence

869
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,303
for the post of tutor
to his grandchildren,

870
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,573
he was also selecting him
as Brenda's...

871
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,243
Yes.
To keep Brenda happy.

872
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:34,150
Then I suppose you know
he didn't sign the will?

873
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,154
Well, yes. That was a surprise.
So Brenda gets the lot.

874
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:43,225
Including, I would say,
the final nail in her coffin.

875
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,692
What's the hurry,
Josephine?

876
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,561
I hear
you're making progress.

877
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:21,063
But you won't be the one
who solves this case.

878
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,365
If anything, you're Watson.

879
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,301
Is that right?

880
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:28,370
Well, why don't you
enlighten me, Holmes?

881
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,706
Tell me about those letters.
What letters?

882
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,342
You know, the ones
that Brenda and Laurence brown

883
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:35,244
are supposedly writing
to each other.

884
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:36,879
Oh, I made that up.

885
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,180
I often make things up.

886
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:40,082
It stops me
from getting too bored.

887
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:41,183
I don't believe you.

888
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:43,419
I know you know things.

889
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:46,889
Sometimes people don't know
what they know.

890
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,357
There you are.

891
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:49,825
What do you want now,
nanny?

892
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:50,859
Your hot chocolate's
ready.

893
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:53,095
Look at you.
Your ballet shoes are all muddy.

894
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,430
I don't like
hot chocolate.

895
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,532
You only make it
so you can drink it yourself.

896
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,133
It will give you
a good night's rest.

897
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:01,036
Not everything they say
on television is true, nanny.

898
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:02,871
Just leave me
alone.

899
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:06,308
Mr. hayward.
Afternoon.

900
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:08,877
What?

901
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,779
I'd say we're due
another murder,

902
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,114
don't you think,
Watson?

903
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:13,682
Another murder,
Holmes?

904
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:16,318
Well, there's always
a second murder.

905
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,187
Someone who knows something
is bumped off

906
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:19,822
before they can reveal
what they know.

907
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,108
I didn't say
you could come in.

908
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,277
I'm sorry. I thought
you couldn't hear me knock.

909
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:43,612
I know every other ass
in this house

910
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,315
is just begging to talk
to you, but I'm not.

911
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,762
You're boring me.

912
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,013
Your tutor, Mr. brown,

913
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,381
what do you make of him?

914
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,451
I reckon Mr. brown's
doing all right for himself.

915
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,253
I wouldn't mind,
would you?

916
00:55:24,255 --> 00:55:25,554
Though
it's a bit weird,

917
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:28,857
fancying
your grandfather's wife.

918
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,794
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I shock you?

919
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:34,830
No, it's just the fact is
everyone fancies granny.

920
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,865
Uncle Roger
has the hots for her.

921
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,033
You can tell.

922
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,968
It must have amused grandpa

923
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,837
to put that cat
amongst the pigeons

924
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,939
and watch the feathers fly.

925
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:49,078
Now, I have a question for you,
Mr. detective.

926
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,014
I can't imagine there's anything
that I can tell you

927
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,215
you don't already know.

928
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,785
Oh, yeah. Did you screw
my sister in Cairo?

929
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,655
Now, your grandfather
has just died.

930
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:02,891
A good thing, really.
It's one less capitalist.

931
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,394
Please. You don't know
what you're talking about.

932
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,129
I didn't hear you.

933
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,530
Did you screw my sister?

934
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,766
Are you really happy
your grandfather is dead?

935
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:14,803
He was a control freak
who played with people's lives.

936
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:15,871
He was a sadistic pig,

937
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,606
and his hubris
was intolerable,

938
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:20,042
and he got what he deserved.

939
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,277
But I don't believe
it was Brenda.

940
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,079
She's not clever enough.

941
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,949
She might have been set up,
though.

942
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,585
By someone clever.

943
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,057
Hm.

944
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:52,741
You really seem to make a habit
of barging in, don't you?

945
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,177
What do you want?
Sorry. It won't take a moment.

946
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:59,882
When Brenda was first introduced
into the household,

947
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,683
did it rather upset
the apple cart?

948
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,420
The apple cart remained upright,
as I recall.

949
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:06,889
Nor was there any tasting
of forbidden fruits,

950
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:08,724
if that's
what you're insinuating.

951
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,526
Now, you really have to go.

952
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:11,994
You forgave him?

953
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,195
There was nothing
to forgive.

954
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,496
It was a childish
infatuation.

955
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:19,034
Yes, I see.
So love turned to hate?

956
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,669
The reason my husband
hates Brenda

957
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:22,905
is because he thinks
she killed his father.

958
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:24,640
It's very simple.
Yes, but you don't.

959
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,275
You know different?
I must insist.

960
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,143
I haven't finished yet.
I don't believe this.

961
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,712
Your husband showed the check
his father gave him.

962
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:31,814
You told him to tear it up.

963
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,482
But he didn't.
Did you realize then

964
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:35,818
there'd never be any escape
from this place until

965
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,820
your father-in-law was dead?
Yes.

966
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:41,290
That exact thought
went through my mind.

967
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,592
But now he is.

968
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,761
So we can.

969
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,532
One more thing.

970
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,059
Sophia?

971
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,063
What are you doing?

972
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,165
You're burning evidence?

973
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,633
Christ's sake.

974
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:26,635
<i>A reporter from the times
just called.</i>

975
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,605
If he knows,
soon everyone will.

976
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,941
Look, there was nothing
of interest regarding his murder

977
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,677
in these memoirs. Trust me.

978
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,046
Trust you?

979
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,518
During the war,
he branched out.

980
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,987
Bombs.

981
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:46,522
First you destroy a city,

982
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:48,490
then you go in afterwards
and rebuild it.

983
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:52,528
I'm not sure the world needs
to know about that.

984
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,795
That and other things.

985
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:56,398
And that's for you
to decide, is it?

986
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,399
Yes, it is.

987
00:58:57,401 --> 00:59:00,235
So, what are you going to do
about it, Charles?

988
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:04,072
What do you know
about trust anyway?

989
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,728
What's wrong?

990
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,298
Car won't start.

991
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:34,937
How very inconsiderate of it.
Plenty of room here.

992
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:37,439
We can have someone fix it
in the morning.

993
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,908
Are you sure?

994
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:46,181
Aunt Edith, I've been looking
all over for you.

995
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,115
Where have you been?

996
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,518
None of your business,
dear.

997
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,054
Fancy meeting you here
at this late hour.

998
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,922
My car
seems to have broken down.

999
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,959
Oh, what a shame.
Such a nice car.

1000
00:59:56,961 --> 01:00:00,128
For a penniless plod, anyway.

1001
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,463
That's the problem.

1002
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:03,765
I can't afford it thirdhand.

1003
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,767
Would you like me
to take you home?

1004
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,905
I've just invited Charles
to stay the night.

1005
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:11,006
Now...

1006
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:14,843
That's a much more
interesting idea.

1007
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,226
Blimey. Haven't seen this
many people around the table

1008
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:32,561
since before granddad died.

1009
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:33,996
What's she doing here?

1010
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:35,030
Nanny?

1011
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,264
Don't make me miss
the fun.

1012
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:38,500
No such thing in this room,
pumpkin.

1013
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,002
Josephine.

1014
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:42,704
I put her to bed,
lady Edith.

1015
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,039
Well, clearly,
she escaped.

1016
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,741
"Escaped"?
She is not a prisoner.

1017
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:49,077
I don't want to go to bed,
aunt Edith. I want to stay.

1018
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,613
I'm afraid you have no choice,
my dear.

1019
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:54,716
With a smile,
my little changeling.

1020
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,687
You'll have to tell me
everything, Watson.

1021
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,255
It's Switzerland
for that young lady,

1022
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,623
and the sooner
the better.

1023
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,392
It's not good for her
to be caught up

1024
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,760
in this
horrid business.

1025
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:06,662
You wanted them
to grow up here.

1026
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,463
I wanted some discipline
in their lives.

1027
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:11,733
I didn't think your father
would control their every move.

1028
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:16,071
Was I to know that
I'd be cheated of motherhood?

1029
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,040
Sometimes I wonder
why you bothered

1030
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,574
to have children at all,
magda.

1031
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,010
Soon as they were born,
you were off to repertory

1032
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:26,214
in the remotest provincial
theater you could find.

1033
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,618
There's something deeply moving
about a spinster's love

1034
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,786
for her sister's offspring.

1035
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,454
Moving
and faintly desperate.

1036
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:36,124
Congratulations, mother.
Another grandstand performance.

1037
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,259
Don't worry, Sophia.

1038
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,860
I've lived
through two world wars.

1039
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:44,132
I can survive magda's drunken
little slings and arrows.

1040
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,467
Josephine is right.

1041
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:48,236
Your presence seems to have
brought everyone together.

1042
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:51,873
With one notable exception.

1043
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,677
The smell of blood.

1044
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:00,182
Now, I didn't realize
that your arrangements

1045
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:02,517
extended to board and lodging,
Mr. hayward.

1046
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,419
Father,
Charles is my guest.

1047
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:05,954
Guests don't snoop around,

1048
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,090
looking on their hosts
as potential murderers.

1049
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:11,426
I'm sure he thinks of all of us
as potential murderers.

1050
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:12,794
You can hardly blame him.

1051
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:15,597
Well, then, Charles.

1052
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,501
How about a blunt question
for you, then?

1053
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,204
What are murderers like?

1054
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,143
Well, um, you.

1055
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,846
And me.

1056
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,814
Everyone.

1057
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,416
Hot-blooded.

1058
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,518
Cold-blooded.

1059
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,287
They do share
one or two traits.

1060
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,556
Vanity.

1061
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:43,825
A distorted morality.

1062
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:46,061
A lack of empathy.

1063
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,630
And murderers tend to feel
that they are above

1064
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:53,568
the rules and laws
that govern ordinary mortals.

1065
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,904
Heh. Well,
that description

1066
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:59,007
fits every member
of this family.

1067
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:00,509
I don't envy you your job.

1068
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:05,514
Nonsense, it's the easiest job
in the world. Open and shut.

1069
01:03:05,516 --> 01:03:07,082
I shall go to my room now.

1070
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,717
It's good of you
to have come at all.

1071
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,986
Considering you couldn't show up
at his funeral.

1072
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,388
I wouldn't have been able
to stand it.

1073
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,090
You heard the weather forecast,
you mean?

1074
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:18,260
None of us enjoy funerals,
but you could at least pretend.

1075
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:19,795
After all you're getting
all our money.

1076
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:23,565
What kind of spell did you put
on that poor, poor sweetie pie?

1077
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:26,668
Aristide always loved dancers.
You know that.

1078
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,003
You weren't a dancer.

1079
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:30,739
You were a girl on a stage
in a bikini.

1080
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:33,375
Which doesn't explain
why he didn't sign his will.

1081
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:36,912
I've said all I have to say
to Mr. hayward.

1082
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:39,181
Surely we don't need a pi
in the house

1083
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:40,982
for us all to tell each other
the truth.

1084
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:44,386
<i>Oh, magda. Isn't that a line
from the last of Mrs. cheyney?</i>

1085
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:46,822
No, it's not.
But if you must know,

1086
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,291
it's from a thriller
i did at frinton.

1087
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,459
I rest my case.

1088
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:52,994
Admit it,
Brenda.

1089
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:57,299
You'd rather be with Laurence.
Are you two in this together?

1090
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,967
Of course they are.

1091
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,969
I hope all this money
won't put a strain

1092
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:02,137
on your principles,
Mr. brown.

1093
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:07,175
Brenda has her very own red
under the bed.

1094
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,577
Is that where you keep him?

1095
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:11,246
You don't know me.
None of you do.

1096
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:12,681
Oh, I think we do.

1097
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,216
At least we know your type.

1098
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,251
Oh, dear,
mommy's in wrecking mode.

1099
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:19,054
I didn't murder him.
I miss him.

1100
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:22,557
And any one of you could have
wished him out of the way.

1101
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,859
What on earth do you mean?

1102
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:25,093
The film script.

1103
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:29,030
The reason he didn't back
the film script, I'm quite sure,

1104
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,166
is because he knew
it would be a triumph

1105
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,667
and lead
to our independence.

1106
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:37,339
Right.
He didn't even read it.

1107
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,641
What?

1108
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:40,475
I did.

1109
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:41,977
So it's all your fault.

1110
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,813
No. I actually said
it was pretty good.

1111
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:46,882
But he said
he'd toss a coin for it,

1112
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:47,849
as there were no dice.

1113
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:49,885
And he asked me to call.

1114
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,889
And you lost.

1115
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,992
And he said
it was poetic justice.

1116
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:59,828
You see now why I didn't want
you involved with my family?

1117
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:03,331
Come on, Sophia. There's nothing
like a real heart-to-heart.

1118
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:07,636
Assuming one could find
any real hearts under this roof.

1119
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:09,004
That's the point.

1120
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:13,909
Unlike all of you,
i actually made him happy.

1121
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,313
That's why he gave me
all the money.

1122
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:24,719
Well...

1123
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:28,657
I'm sorry to interrupt
this oh-so-sweet family reunion,

1124
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:30,625
but now I have something
to say.

1125
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:34,729
Josephine could be right.
It is a fun evening after all.

1126
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,198
Not especially.

1127
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,701
Roger and I are leaving...

1128
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,504
For good.

1129
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:43,271
Anywhere nice?

1130
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,941
Barbados.
Plenty of toxic plants

1131
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:46,908
for clemency.

1132
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,644
We intend to create,
fund and manage an orphanage.

1133
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:52,881
Oh. Some people
have all the luck.

1134
01:05:52,883 --> 01:05:56,051
I'd have thought
any need you had for children

1135
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:57,819
was fully satisfied
by Roger.

1136
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,155
Don't you ever get tired
of sounding superior?

1137
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:04,559
Ruin the family business
and bugger off to Barbados.

1138
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:05,794
How very like my brother.

1139
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:10,865
Better than losing everything
playing baccarat on the riviera.

1140
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,667
Poor Roger.

1141
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:16,504
Who has no idea
how fun life can be.

1142
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,475
He chose me.

1143
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,344
Yes.

1144
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:25,613
And every single day,
i wonder why.

1145
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:28,183
But I never asked him...

1146
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:31,252
To love me more
than he loved you.

1147
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,298
Yes, eustace?

1148
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,134
I have a question for Sophia.

1149
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:49,137
Did Mr. hayward screw you
in Cairo?

1150
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:51,506
Oh, no,
it's just he seemed unsure

1151
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,175
when I asked him.
Don't be vulgar, eustace.

1152
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,512
Oh. That's quite a sense
of the dramatic.

1153
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,148
Can you explain
what relevance that has

1154
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,649
to our discussion,
my darling boy?

1155
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:05,420
It is actually
very relevant.

1156
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,589
What if she's the killer?

1157
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,525
And they're in it together.

1158
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:43,625
You see?

1159
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,661
They're coming after you
now.

1160
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,430
These people.

1161
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,365
They bring out
all the evil.

1162
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:52,700
Oh, Charles.
I'm so frightened.

1163
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:53,735
What will happen next?

1164
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:56,438
The press,
will they be dreadful?

1165
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,706
Don't give
any interviews.

1166
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,341
You ought to get yourself
a lawyer

1167
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:02,510
to tell you what to do
and what to say

1168
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:03,711
and what not to do
and what not...

1169
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,780
I need someone like you,
Charles.

1170
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:06,614
Just hold tight.

1171
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:09,284
Keep quiet,
and it will be all right.

1172
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,286
Do you really
think so?

1173
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,154
So she got to you.

1174
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:15,557
I knew she would.

1175
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,060
Sophia, wait.

1176
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:21,229
Sophia, stop. Sophia.

1177
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,530
You're just like
the rest of them.

1178
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,766
Take her to bed
and be done with it.

1179
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:25,700
No. Stop it.

1180
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:27,602
I can see her side of it,
that's all.

1181
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,004
Oh, what a high moral tone
you're taking.

1182
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:32,607
I have to give it to her.
She's got a special gift

1183
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,408
for dividing people.

1184
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,010
Now she's dividing us.
What are you talking about?

1185
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,245
Brenda hasn't divided us.

1186
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,013
You walked away from me
in Cairo.

1187
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:39,781
Heh. Yes.

1188
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:43,184
And did you ever
ask yourself why?

1189
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,697
Please.

1190
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,066
Go away, Charles! You're fired.

1191
01:08:58,068 --> 01:09:01,136
You won't be able to fire
the police.

1192
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:03,304
Sophia!

1193
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:50,018
Oh, it's you.
I thought you were someone else.

1194
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,121
What are you doing?
Same as you. Detecting.

1195
01:09:53,123 --> 01:09:55,190
Up here?
I must go.

1196
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,392
Wait.

1197
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,237
Josephine!

1198
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,508
Sensationalist tosh.

1199
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,884
You've been in the wars.

1200
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,787
Well,
your husband's dogs and I

1201
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:08,523
had a little cuddle
last night.

1202
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:10,091
Suits you.

1203
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,796
You all right?

1204
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,835
We weren't always like this,
you know,

1205
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,304
my husband and I.

1206
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:27,842
We used to be the most glamorous
couple in London.

1207
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:32,580
They put our pictures
in all the magazines.

1208
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,750
People looked up to us.

1209
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,854
I wonder what happened.

1210
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,217
You know, Charles,

1211
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:11,819
they're trained combat dogs.

1212
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:14,922
They could kill you
in an instant

1213
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:17,024
if they really wanted to.

1214
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:18,226
Meaning?

1215
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:21,162
Like the rest of us,

1216
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,831
they like you.

1217
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,535
The man from the garage
has arrived

1218
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:30,037
to mend your car,
Mr. hayward.

1219
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:32,006
Right.

1220
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:41,649
Oh, these reporters
are relentless.

1221
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:54,095
Starter cable. It's missing.

1222
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,465
Right, well...

1223
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,803
We can keep this
between us.

1224
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:05,673
Charles,
there's a call for you.

1225
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:08,042
Chief inspector taverner
from Scotland yard.

1226
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,745
I had pneumonia.
Is that a crime?

1227
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:14,749
We are just trying to establish
the facts, Mr. agrodopolous.

1228
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:18,419
Were you unaware
Mr. leonides was dead?

1229
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,388
Until I see the papers, yes.

1230
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,758
You think my son should read out
the death columns to me

1231
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,660
every day in the hospital?
Heh.

1232
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:27,762
How did you know
Mr. leonides?

1233
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:30,765
He helped me
when I first arrived in London.

1234
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:31,699
Why?

1235
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,202
We greeks stick together.

1236
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:35,203
That is why.

1237
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:37,905
Look, I don't know nothing.

1238
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,407
He gave me the envelope.

1239
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:43,311
When he dies,
i take it to gaitskill.

1240
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:46,047
And you never opened it?

1241
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:48,683
The envelope was closed
with an unbroken seal.

1242
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:52,286
Do you know the lawyers
who drew up this new will?

1243
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:57,625
Not personally, but I'm aware
that Mr. leonides used them

1244
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:59,861
for the other side
of his affairs.

1245
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:01,963
And you remain the executor.

1246
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:06,534
Yes,
but without enthusiasm.

1247
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,469
He settled a small sum
on the widow.

1248
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:12,707
The rest of the estate goes
to a single beneficiary.

1249
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,142
The granddaughter, Sophia.

1250
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,713
Yes?

1251
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:22,016
There's been a call
from the leonides house.

1252
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,185
Yes?
Someone's tried to kill

1253
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,920
the little girl.

1254
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:28,089
My god.

1255
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,561
The rope was cut
half-through.

1256
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,663
- Who found her?
- I did.

1257
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,765
My father went with her
in the ambulance.

1258
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,867
Does she remember anything?

1259
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,736
She was unconscious.

1260
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:44,238
She must have fallen
from the very top.

1261
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,541
My poor cherub.

1262
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,210
Mother, if you want to go there,
i can drive you.

1263
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,679
Well, there's
no great rush, no.

1264
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:54,415
Philip says they're doing
everything they can.

1265
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,183
Oh, if you want to make
your mother happy,

1266
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:59,420
I wouldn't say no
to a gin and it.

1267
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:02,156
You were the one up there
in the tree house last night.

1268
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:07,094
I thought you were a prowler.
That's why I let the dogs out.

1269
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,365
Man named gaitskill
is here, sir.

1270
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:13,801
Oh, let him in.

1271
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,604
What's gaitskill
doing here?

1272
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,681
What a mess.

1273
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,121
This is a crime scene,
lady Edith.

1274
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:38,059
It is also my home.

1275
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,678
It's so unfair.

1276
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,146
What's going on?

1277
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,281
Why is gaitskill here?

1278
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:35,683
Ask Sophia.

1279
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:44,025
Let's Usher in the reign
of queen Sophia.

1280
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:47,094
Allow me to congratulate you,
Sophia.

1281
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:49,230
You are
a very wealthy woman.

1282
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:52,133
If I may,
i suggest you make a new will

1283
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:54,702
at your earliest
opportunity.

1284
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:57,838
A good day to you all.

1285
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,244
Madame Sophia.

1286
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:06,180
Your penniless
and broken-down old mother

1287
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,116
begs you for alms.

1288
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:10,918
Spare us a copper, dear.

1289
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,188
Your ma wants to be
in the pictures.

1290
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,489
You're very funny,
my love,

1291
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:18,693
but perhaps this isn't
the time for clowning.

1292
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,328
I suppose you're going
to bail Roger out.

1293
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,963
We don't want
any of the money.

1294
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:25,232
I will sell
associated catering.

1295
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:26,000
Good girl.

1296
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,803
No point throwing good money
after bad.

1297
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:33,007
I was
his eldest son.

1298
01:18:33,009 --> 01:18:35,876
But to stab me in the back
with his dying breath.

1299
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,311
Look at you both.

1300
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:39,547
Desperate
and humiliated

1301
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:42,550
because now you're going
to have to go to Sophia's door

1302
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,351
with your
begging bowls.

1303
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:46,554
Get out of this room.

1304
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,256
Now!

1305
01:18:55,764 --> 01:19:00,935
Beware of the vultures,
sister, dear.

1306
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,838
It's one hell of a burden
on your shoulders.

1307
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,108
I think
we're forgetting ourselves.

1308
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:09,076
Philip, tell me.

1309
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,145
How is dear Josephine?

1310
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,113
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1311
01:19:12,115 --> 01:19:15,082
She's going to be fine,
thank god. No broken bones.

1312
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,485
They want to keep her in
for observation.

1313
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:18,486
Very wise.

1314
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:21,288
She should not be
in this house.

1315
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,089
Much too dangerous.

1316
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,024
Well,
as entertaining as this is,

1317
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,726
I've had enough
of all the drama.

1318
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:27,228
Roger needs to be gone
from this house.

1319
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,064
We shall pack our bags,
and we shall go.

1320
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:33,501
Congratulations, my darling.

1321
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:39,774
I have a sneaking suspicion
that he made the right choice.

1322
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,913
Sophia.

1323
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,551
You are
an extremely clever woman.

1324
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,186
And you are a de haviland.

1325
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:55,523
I have seen what it takes
to operate at a certain level,

1326
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:57,658
and it is not
always pretty.

1327
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,493
So I want you
to remember

1328
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:05,833
that lineage will help you find
what's most important in life.

1329
01:20:05,835 --> 01:20:09,537
A sense of balance.

1330
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:13,874
Well, my angel,

1331
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:17,411
<i>perhaps we should talk
about exposure.</i>

1332
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:19,780
I'm sorry, papa.

1333
01:20:19,782 --> 01:20:23,117
But your father
wrote it.

1334
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,926
At least read
the bloody thing.

1335
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:34,995
It would only prolong
the agony.

1336
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,666
Papa...

1337
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:59,019
Grandfather always said
fortunes don't last

1338
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,555
if they get split between
the weak members of a family.

1339
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:04,525
They should be concentrated
in the hands of the strong.

1340
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:07,728
Did you know about this will,
Sophia?

1341
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,231
Yes.

1342
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:13,901
Looks bad, doesn't it?

1343
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:15,769
He first mentioned the idea

1344
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:18,472
when things started to get ugly
in Cairo.

1345
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,074
He said
i should come back to england

1346
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:22,643
so he could teach me
to handle his empire.

1347
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:25,145
That's why you left me.

1348
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:27,581
That and the fact
you were spying on me.

1349
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:29,216
"Spying" is a big word.

1350
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,952
You broke my heart, Charles.

1351
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:35,055
And I resigned.

1352
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,530
Why didn't you tell me
about this will?

1353
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:47,234
I don't know.
When it didn't turn up,

1354
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,703
I thought it was another
of grandfather's tricks.

1355
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:52,539
He liked to toy with people.

1356
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,275
Must run in the blood.

1357
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:56,477
That's what he thought.

1358
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:59,213
He said I looked
like a de haviland,

1359
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:02,082
but the blood in my veins
was leonides.

1360
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,084
So nothing
could ever resist me.

1361
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:06,320
I think he may have had
a point.

1362
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:10,557
You really believe I could have
murdered him, don't you?

1363
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,132
No, Sophia...

1364
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:28,475
Maybe Mr. brown
has taken up gardening.

1365
01:22:28,477 --> 01:22:31,278
Or perhaps
they were planted on him.

1366
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,314
It's all a bit
too convenient.

1367
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:35,249
It helps your
girlfriend's case, though.

1368
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:40,054
Worth killing for,
that sort of pot of gold.

1369
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,026
She's not my girlfriend.

1370
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:49,396
I've taken over
this investigation, Charles.

1371
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:51,465
Your position
is compromised.

1372
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:55,402
You should be with the other...
Suspects.

1373
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:56,337
If you say so.

1374
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:59,073
Those are lady Edith's
secateurs.

1375
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:00,274
And they don't prove
anything.

1376
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:02,543
Any old knife could've been used
to cut those ropes.

1377
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:06,380
What we need is direct evidence
of a liaison

1378
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:10,217
between Mr. brown
and Mrs. leonides.

1379
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,195
This is a joke,
Charles.

1380
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:23,597
I'm afraid not.

1381
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,632
Well...

1382
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:27,935
You go first then.

1383
01:23:27,937 --> 01:23:29,703
Right.

1384
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,878
Charles.
Yes, sir?

1385
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,215
Is this what
a distinguished chief inspector

1386
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:43,917
should be doing
in his golden years?

1387
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:46,587
Heh-heh-heh.

1388
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,391
Hallelujah.

1389
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:16,383
"Oh, Laurence, my darling,
my own dear love.

1390
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,118
"I cannot talk
about last night.

1391
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,387
"For if I do,
my heart will burst.

1392
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:24,958
It won't be long now
before we can be together."

1393
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,026
"My darling...

1394
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:31,031
"Is impatience in a lover
a crime or a virtue?

1395
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:35,669
"I don't want him to suffer,
not after his kindness to me,

1396
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:38,605
but I do wish him gone."

1397
01:25:28,591 --> 01:25:31,558
Mrs. leonides.

1398
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,861
I have to ask you
to accompany me

1399
01:25:33,863 --> 01:25:36,029
to Scotland yard.

1400
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:38,298
I'm sorry?

1401
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,167
Anything you say

1402
01:25:40,169 --> 01:25:41,368
may be taken down

1403
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:44,037
and used in evidence
against you.

1404
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:45,672
Do you understand?

1405
01:25:50,546 --> 01:25:52,179
But I didn't write this.

1406
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:54,148
Mrs. leonides, please.

1407
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,783
I would never do anything
like this.

1408
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,423
You show them some dignity.

1409
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,596
I didn't write that.

1410
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:12,199
I would never write that.

1411
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:16,603
No, it was them.
It was them.

1412
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,309
You must be so happy.
You'll rot in hell.

1413
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:24,878
You old hypocrite!
Daddy's little boy.

1414
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,382
You couldn't keep your hands
off me when I got here!

1415
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:32,152
Charlie, help me.
These vampires.

1416
01:26:32,154 --> 01:26:36,256
They set us up because
we're not part of their world.

1417
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:38,225
Don't let them fool you.

1418
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:40,794
Charles, please!

1419
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,598
They set us up!

1420
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,635
Here.

1421
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:01,982
We never stood a chance
against them.

1422
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:08,388
Well, I was completely taken in
by her performance.

1423
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,158
Mother, if Brenda is guilty,
then she'll hang.

1424
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,093
- That's enough.
- She should be tortured.

1425
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:14,528
You'd enjoy
watching that.

1426
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,562
He wasn't your father.

1427
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,864
I loved my father.
Do you understand? I loved him.

1428
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:21,535
More than you'll ever love me.

1429
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,850
Better now?

1430
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,856
I want Brenda
to have the best lawyer

1431
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,925
money can buy. We'll pay.

1432
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:49,029
She's always been
out of her depth.

1433
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:51,465
Poor thing.

1434
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,367
Where are you going?

1435
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:56,737
An appointment in town,
dear.

1436
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:59,373
Well, Charles.

1437
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:03,277
You redeemed yourself
at the last moment.

1438
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:06,780
Have to admit, I couldn't
have done it without you.

1439
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,249
The evidence is almost
entirely circumstantial.

1440
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:11,218
Usually is in a murder case.

1441
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:15,555
A lot depends on the impression
they make on the jury.

1442
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:20,761
And if you ever need
a proper job,

1443
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,896
you know where to find me.

1444
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:25,899
What are you thinking,
Charles?

1445
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,568
That it still could be me?

1446
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,337
And I got away with it
scot-free,

1447
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:31,772
with all the money,
thanks to you.

1448
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:36,076
And that's why I chose you
in the first place.

1449
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:44,718
Someone could have forged
those letters, couldn't they?

1450
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,535
They talk about you
in the papers.

1451
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:03,270
How you helped
solve the case.

1452
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:05,972
Good morning, miss ackroyd.
Oh, Mr. hayward.

1453
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:07,374
This is the making of you.

1454
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:13,013
We can get in the decorators
and everything.

1455
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:22,322
Here we are, pumpkin.
Run along to nanny.

1456
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:23,690
Here you are.

1457
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:27,461
Oh. I'm so glad to see you.

1458
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:29,396
I've missed such a lot.

1459
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:31,498
I didn't need to be kept
in hospital all that time.

1460
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,700
Don't look so angry,
my little changeling.

1461
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,635
Stop calling her that,
magda.

1462
01:29:35,637 --> 01:29:38,672
How I address my own daughter,
auntie,

1463
01:29:38,674 --> 01:29:41,141
is none of your business.

1464
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:44,711
Josephine, darling, you're back.

1465
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:50,016
Tell me, what was Brenda
and Laurence's reaction?

1466
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:51,251
Did they beg for mercy?

1467
01:29:51,253 --> 01:29:54,488
I wish you wouldn't talk
about people that way.

1468
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,490
They found love letters
on the tower's balcony.

1469
01:29:56,492 --> 01:30:00,794
I knew it. I have to write it
all down in my notebook.

1470
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:02,829
Well, I'm off.

1471
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:36,630
Josephine!

1472
01:30:36,632 --> 01:30:38,632
I cleaned these
while you were away.

1473
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:40,834
And I'm making you
some hot chocolate.

1474
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:41,968
It will make you...

1475
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:45,105
oh, good gracious.
Have you seen my notebook?

1476
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:46,173
Why? Have you lost it?

1477
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:47,240
I thought it was in my room.

1478
01:30:47,242 --> 01:30:48,542
I can't find it anywhere.

1479
01:30:48,544 --> 01:30:50,911
Well, have you tried
the tree house?

1480
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:52,712
I know you took it.
You hate it.

1481
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:55,982
All right, little lady,
calm down.

1482
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:57,751
I'll find it.

1483
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:09,863
Lady Edith,

1484
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:14,601
I'm afraid your results
do not bode well.

1485
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,505
How long?

1486
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,675
Hard to tell.

1487
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,745
Maybe a few months.

1488
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,115
There is a promising
new experimental treatment.

1489
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:32,519
I don't want
other treatments.

1490
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:36,156
It's over, isn't it?

1491
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,666
Well...

1492
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:50,804
Always leave a party
at its height,

1493
01:31:50,806 --> 01:31:54,007
when you're
most enjoying it.

1494
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:59,813
Nanny, milk's boiling!

1495
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:02,849
I'll be off now,

1496
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,417
if that's all right,
Mr. hayward.

1497
01:32:04,419 --> 01:32:07,521
Yes. I'll lock up.

1498
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:08,421
Thank you.

1499
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:12,192
So many people
called today.

1500
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:14,628
Good night.

1501
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:22,569
Come in.

1502
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:24,871
Nanny's made
your hot chocolate.

1503
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,040
I hate hot chocolate
and nanny knows it.

1504
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:28,174
She only makes it for me
so she...

1505
01:32:28,176 --> 01:32:32,312
so she can drink it herself.
I know.

1506
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:37,250
Why are you so angry,
Josephine?

1507
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:38,418
I'm bored.

1508
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:41,555
And I can't find
my notebook.

1509
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:44,724
It's okay.
We'll find it.

1510
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:58,525
Charles hayward.

1511
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:18,778
It's all quiet here, sir.

1512
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:31,558
I was the one who brought
the mug up to Josephine, but...

1513
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,759
but nanny prepared it.

1514
01:35:32,761 --> 01:35:35,462
But if she made it
for Josephine,

1515
01:35:35,464 --> 01:35:36,930
why did she drink it?

1516
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:39,265
In time to say goodbye,
Mr. hayward.

1517
01:35:39,267 --> 01:35:42,769
Where are you going?
London airport.

1518
01:35:42,771 --> 01:35:44,971
Close the gates!
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1519
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:46,840
- We'll miss our flight.
- We understand

1520
01:35:46,842 --> 01:35:49,008
how difficult this is,
but Roger and I are leaving

1521
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:52,011
so we can lead our lives.
Why on earth would we want

1522
01:35:52,013 --> 01:35:54,681
to poison a nice old woman
who had never done us harm?

1523
01:35:54,683 --> 01:35:56,750
Perhaps she wasn't
the intended target.

1524
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:59,552
Oh, excuse me?
Hold on, Mr. detective.

1525
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:00,754
Can you prove
anything?

1526
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:02,922
Can you prove
it wasn't a heart attack?

1527
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:05,158
Or a suicide?
Are you sure she was poisoned?

1528
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,161
The coroner is working on it
as we speak.

1529
01:36:08,163 --> 01:36:12,132
Nobody gets to leave here
without my express permission.

1530
01:36:12,134 --> 01:36:13,700
Clemmy, call my lawyer.

1531
01:36:13,702 --> 01:36:16,169
I want to check
if chief inspector taverner's

1532
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:18,271
conduct is within the law.

1533
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:19,372
No one can bully us

1534
01:36:19,374 --> 01:36:23,009
into spending another day
in this house!

1535
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:24,878
Josephine,
you're safe now.

1536
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,614
You're with mommy and daddy.
We'll take care of you.

1537
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,749
Ah. Mr. hayward, you must be

1538
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:32,018
some sort of magician. Every
time we make you disappear,

1539
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,521
you keep popping back up.
I need to talk to Josephine.

1540
01:36:34,523 --> 01:36:36,222
Well,
who doesn't these days?

1541
01:36:36,224 --> 01:36:38,158
She'll be on a plane
to lausanne tonight.

1542
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,594
Nanny's been poisoned.
Just like grandfather.

1543
01:36:41,596 --> 01:36:43,363
Isn't it exciting?
Good god.

1544
01:36:43,365 --> 01:36:46,099
Well, aren't you
the least bit upset?

1545
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:47,667
I thought
you liked nanny.

1546
01:36:47,669 --> 01:36:49,169
Not particularly.
Oh.

1547
01:36:49,171 --> 01:36:52,405
She was always scolding me
about something. She fussed.

1548
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:54,541
And I'm sure
she stole my notebook.

1549
01:36:54,543 --> 01:36:58,611
Josephine, is there anyone
you're remotely fond of?

1550
01:36:58,613 --> 01:37:00,847
I love aunt Edith
very much.

1551
01:37:00,849 --> 01:37:03,283
Well, what about us?

1552
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:06,953
Josephine.

1553
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:12,125
Excuse me.
Won't take a moment.

1554
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:17,230
Well, what about us?

1555
01:37:17,232 --> 01:37:18,164
Really.

1556
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:21,534
- You're hurting me!
- Now, Josephine,

1557
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:22,402
you and I,

1558
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:24,003
we are both solving this case.
Aren't we?

1559
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,539
I haven't got my notebook.
Don't worry about that.

1560
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,541
What exactly
do you know?

1561
01:37:28,543 --> 01:37:30,143
I know
lots of things.

1562
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:33,046
Of that I have no doubt.
But you know

1563
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:35,915
who put something in your
hot chocolate, don't you?

1564
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:38,551
And you know who poisoned
your grandfather.

1565
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:41,454
And you know who cut the ropes
from your tree house.

1566
01:37:41,456 --> 01:37:44,257
Right. Well, now is the time
for Holmes

1567
01:37:44,259 --> 01:37:47,527
to enlighten
not only Watson,

1568
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:48,328
but lestrade.

1569
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,363
I shan't tell the police
anything.

1570
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,164
They're stupid.

1571
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:53,466
They thought Brenda had done it
or Laurence.

1572
01:37:53,468 --> 01:37:55,068
I wasn't stupid
like that.

1573
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:56,903
I knew jolly well
they hadn't done it.

1574
01:37:56,905 --> 01:37:58,037
I had an idea
who it was all along,

1575
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:01,507
and then I made a kind of test.
And I know I'm right.

1576
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:02,909
Now, you listen to me.

1577
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:05,712
I dare say
you are extremely clever.

1578
01:38:05,714 --> 01:38:07,981
It won't be much good to you
if you're not alive

1579
01:38:07,983 --> 01:38:09,782
long enough
to enjoy the fact.

1580
01:38:09,784 --> 01:38:11,651
Don't you understand,
you foolish child,

1581
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:14,354
that so long as you insist
on keeping your little secrets,

1582
01:38:14,356 --> 01:38:16,456
you put yourself
in imminent danger?

1583
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:17,423
Of course
i do.

1584
01:38:17,425 --> 01:38:18,258
But in some books,

1585
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:19,626
person after person
is killed.

1586
01:38:19,628 --> 01:38:22,262
And you end by spotting
the murderer because he or she

1587
01:38:22,264 --> 01:38:23,796
is practically
the only person left.

1588
01:38:23,798 --> 01:38:25,164
We must wait and see
what happens next.

1589
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:27,600
This isn't a detective story,
for chrissake!

1590
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:29,035
Two people
have been murdered.

1591
01:38:29,037 --> 01:38:30,937
I'm gonna make you tell me
what you know

1592
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:33,439
if I have to shake you
until your teeth rattle!

1593
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:35,141
There you are,
Charles.

1594
01:38:35,143 --> 01:38:36,576
Lady Edith.

1595
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:38,678
Josephine and I, we were
just having a little chat.

1596
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,148
Of course. And everybody
is a bit tense today,

1597
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:47,020
which is quite understandable
under the circumstances.

1598
01:38:47,022 --> 01:38:47,654
Charles...

1599
01:38:47,656 --> 01:38:50,657
Mm.
Chief inspector taverner

1600
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:52,225
and the coroner
are looking for you.

1601
01:38:52,227 --> 01:38:55,862
I understand they're making
significant progress.

1602
01:38:55,864 --> 01:38:57,263
Right, well...

1603
01:38:57,265 --> 01:39:00,600
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

1604
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,568
Lady...
i know, Charles.

1605
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:04,971
Let me handle this.

1606
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:07,640
Yes, of course.

1607
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:14,147
Now...

1608
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:17,317
What do you think
about going into longbridge

1609
01:39:17,319 --> 01:39:19,619
and having
an ice cream soda?

1610
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,321
Yes.

1611
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:32,598
I understand
you're making progress?

1612
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,835
We'll have to wait
for the analysis report.

1613
01:39:35,837 --> 01:39:38,237
You do have a theory,
though?

1614
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:39,605
Well...

1615
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:41,341
Considering the symptoms,

1616
01:39:41,343 --> 01:39:42,642
and the fact
that it needs to be

1617
01:39:42,644 --> 01:39:44,644
a rather common
and accessible poison,

1618
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:49,048
my educated guess
would be cyanide.

1619
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,418
Why would anyone have cyanide
in their house?

1620
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:55,021
Apart from killing people,
you mean?

1621
01:39:55,023 --> 01:39:56,723
Heh, yeah.

1622
01:39:56,725 --> 01:39:58,491
Moles.

1623
01:39:58,493 --> 01:39:59,292
Moles?

1624
01:39:59,294 --> 01:40:04,030
Cyanide is used
to kill moles.

1625
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:27,620
Sorry, lady Edith, no one's
permitted to leave the estate.

1626
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:32,258
I know.

1627
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,093
But chief inspector taverner
has decided

1628
01:40:34,095 --> 01:40:37,730
it would be more appropriate
if she were out of the house

1629
01:40:37,732 --> 01:40:39,465
for the next hour or so.

1630
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:42,201
Until the corpse
has been removed.

1631
01:40:42,203 --> 01:40:46,039
I mean, he doesn't believe
that a 12-year-old little girl

1632
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:48,608
or a feeble old woman
on her last legs

1633
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:49,609
could be the murderers.

1634
01:40:49,611 --> 01:40:51,210
Do you agree, sergeant?

1635
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:52,578
Sorry.
We've all been a bit on edge.

1636
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:54,881
I'll get them out of the way.

1637
01:40:54,883 --> 01:40:55,515
Of course.

1638
01:40:55,517 --> 01:40:57,850
- All right.
- Move them out the way.

1639
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,099
Charles?
Look.

1640
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:47,934
What are you doing?
It's Josephine's diary.

1641
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:51,471
Edith is trying to destroy it
by burying it in quicklime.

1642
01:41:51,473 --> 01:41:54,307
And there's cyanide
up there.

1643
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:57,810
What? What is it? What?

1644
01:41:57,812 --> 01:41:59,912
Aunt Edith's just left
three gables.

1645
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:02,215
She took Josephine.

1646
01:42:08,322 --> 01:42:10,189
That's aunt Edith's
handwriting.

1647
01:42:10,191 --> 01:42:12,558
Get in the car.

1648
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:13,893
It's so annoying.

1649
01:42:13,895 --> 01:42:15,528
I can't find my notebook
anywhere.

1650
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:18,464
You haven't seen it,
have you?

1651
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,502
Oh, my darling.

1652
01:42:22,504 --> 01:42:26,272
I love you more
than you'll ever know.

1653
01:42:31,346 --> 01:42:34,046
Has lady Edith left the estate?
She left with the girl.

1654
01:42:34,048 --> 01:42:35,414
Where?
That way. Why?

1655
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:36,682
Get those people
out of the way!

1656
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:37,817
Move! Get out the way!

1657
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,786
Move! Get back! Now.

1658
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:48,995
What does it say?

1659
01:42:48,997 --> 01:42:51,831
"I, Edith Jane de haviland,
confess to the murder

1660
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:54,767
of aristide leonides."

1661
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:57,470
God, Josephine.

1662
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:08,814
Josephine,
i have a confession.

1663
01:43:08,816 --> 01:43:10,683
What is it?

1664
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:14,353
We are not going
for ice cream.

1665
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:19,792
Would you like to know
where we're going?

1666
01:43:19,794 --> 01:43:21,327
Well, yes.

1667
01:43:21,329 --> 01:43:26,299
I am taking you
to your new ballet lessons.

1668
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,000
Ballet lessons?

1669
01:43:28,002 --> 01:43:30,670
Oh, aunt Edith.

1670
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,139
But I haven't got
my ballet slippers.

1671
01:43:33,141 --> 01:43:34,540
Why didn't you say?

1672
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,710
I think they'll have everything
we could possibly want

1673
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,745
once we get there.

1674
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:43,482
I wish grandpapa
could see this.

1675
01:43:47,154 --> 01:43:50,156
Why would aunt Edith want
to kill grandpapa and nanny?

1676
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:51,557
She's not a psychopath.

1677
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:52,625
I don't think it was Edith.

1678
01:43:52,627 --> 01:43:54,193
Not Edith?
Maybe there's something

1679
01:43:54,195 --> 01:43:57,430
in Josephine's notebook.
Read it out loud.

1680
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,934
Uh...

1681
01:44:01,936 --> 01:44:03,336
"I'm so bored.

1682
01:44:03,338 --> 01:44:06,806
Something needs to happen
in this house.

1683
01:44:06,808 --> 01:44:08,708
So today I..."

1684
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:12,345
Oh, my god.

1685
01:44:12,347 --> 01:44:14,247
Go on.

1686
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:17,950
"So today i...
i killed grandpapa."

1687
01:44:17,952 --> 01:44:19,085
<i>...grandpapa.</i>

1688
01:44:19,087 --> 01:44:20,353
<i>And I enjoyed it very much.</i>

1689
01:44:20,355 --> 01:44:23,656
<i>I certainly had a good reason
to do it, though.</i>

1690
01:44:23,658 --> 01:44:25,191
<i>And I warned him.</i>

1691
01:44:25,193 --> 01:44:27,727
<i>I told him he'd be sorry
for stopping my ballet.</i>

1692
01:44:27,729 --> 01:44:30,429
<i>And now I hope
he jolly well is.</i>

1693
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:32,198
<i>He really shouldn't
have done that.</i>

1694
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:35,901
<i>That and other things.
Many other things.</i>

1695
01:44:35,903 --> 01:44:38,170
<i>He's mean. Cruel.</i>

1696
01:44:38,172 --> 01:44:39,472
<i>He's a bad person.</i>

1697
01:44:39,474 --> 01:44:41,340
<i>And he thinks
he can do anything.</i>

1698
01:44:41,342 --> 01:44:44,143
<i>He thinks he can tell everyone
what to do</i>

1699
01:44:44,145 --> 01:44:46,479
<i>and make them crazy
and miserable.</i>

1700
01:44:46,481 --> 01:44:48,814
<i>But not me. I'm stronger.</i>

1701
01:44:48,816 --> 01:44:51,017
<i>I'm different.
I'm like him.</i>

1702
01:44:51,019 --> 01:44:53,653
<i>And I gave him a special treat
for his birthday.</i>

1703
01:44:53,655 --> 01:44:55,354
<i>I did my best dance
for him.</i>

1704
01:44:55,356 --> 01:44:58,124
<i>I know how much he likes
watching Brenda dance.</i>

1705
01:44:58,126 --> 01:44:59,825
<i>I can see it
from my tree house.</i>

1706
01:44:59,827 --> 01:45:01,394
<i>I also know
how much he loved it</i>

1707
01:45:01,396 --> 01:45:03,362
<i>when Sophia wanted
to be a ballerina.</i>

1708
01:45:03,364 --> 01:45:05,765
<i>He thought
she was beautiful and gracious.</i>

1709
01:45:05,767 --> 01:45:07,466
<i>But he said
there was no point in me</i>

1710
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:08,834
<i>having any more
ballet lessons</i>

1711
01:45:08,836 --> 01:45:11,337
<i>because I would never be
good enough or gracious enough.</i>

1712
01:45:11,339 --> 01:45:15,041
<i>He said it wasn't so much
swan lake as duck pond.</i>

1713
01:45:15,043 --> 01:45:18,444
<i>I hate him. I hate him.</i>

1714
01:45:18,446 --> 01:45:22,114
There's a bit
about Brenda's letter.

1715
01:45:22,116 --> 01:45:23,783
"I finally got the hang
of her handwriting."

1716
01:45:23,785 --> 01:45:27,586
<i>It's lucky she writes
like a child of 10.</i>

1717
01:45:27,588 --> 01:45:30,756
<i>I copied it
from a bit in exposure.</i>

1718
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:33,292
Is this the right way?

1719
01:45:33,294 --> 01:45:35,961
I believe so.

1720
01:45:35,963 --> 01:45:38,064
<i>Today, I have to be
very brave.</i>

1721
01:45:38,066 --> 01:45:41,801
<i>I put aunt Edith's secateurs
in Laurence's drawer</i>

1722
01:45:41,803 --> 01:45:42,968
<i>in the school room.</i>

1723
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:47,840
<i>Now I must climb up
to the tree house with a knife.</i>

1724
01:45:52,347 --> 01:45:56,315
<i>But every task worth doing
has a hard bit.</i>

1725
01:45:58,986 --> 01:46:00,319
"Nanny's guessed.

1726
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:03,155
Eustace kept asking questions,
and I worried he might."

1727
01:46:03,157 --> 01:46:05,458
<i>But he didn't. Nanny did.</i>

1728
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:07,960
<i>She's snooping around
all the time.</i>

1729
01:46:07,962 --> 01:46:10,396
<i>She certainly saw my
ballet shoes, which were muddy</i>

1730
01:46:10,398 --> 01:46:12,665
<i>after I took secateurs
from the shed.</i>

1731
01:46:12,667 --> 01:46:13,599
<i>She kept looking at me,</i>

1732
01:46:13,601 --> 01:46:16,369
<i>and I knew she'd put two
and two together. I hate nanny.</i>

1733
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:19,638
<i>Always after me,
trying to teach me lessons.</i>

1734
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,940
<i>And she's so stupid.</i>

1735
01:46:20,942 --> 01:46:22,575
<i>I hate stupid people.</i>

1736
01:46:22,577 --> 01:46:25,945
"They're useless,
apart from dying during wars

1737
01:46:25,947 --> 01:46:27,913
"like grandpapa used to say.

1738
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:29,949
She should be next."

1739
01:46:29,951 --> 01:46:33,119
Edith must have sensed
something,

1740
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:36,088
and then she found
Josephine's notebook.

1741
01:46:36,623 --> 01:46:38,324
And then Josephine
killed nanny.

1742
01:46:38,326 --> 01:46:40,793
And that's when Edith decided
to blame herself.

1743
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:43,396
She couldn't let Laurence
and Brenda hang

1744
01:46:43,398 --> 01:46:44,797
for a crime
they hadn't committed.

1745
01:46:44,799 --> 01:46:47,600
But at the same time she
couldn't let her Josephine

1746
01:46:47,602 --> 01:46:49,602
face a lifetime
of institutions,

1747
01:46:49,604 --> 01:46:51,837
being jeered at
as a monster,

1748
01:46:51,839 --> 01:46:53,005
laughed at as a freak,

1749
01:46:53,007 --> 01:46:54,740
not to mention
the public humiliation

1750
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:56,041
the house would have had
to endure.

1751
01:46:56,043 --> 01:47:00,079
What is she doing
with Josephine?

1752
01:47:02,849 --> 01:47:04,884
There they are.

1753
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:16,128
Why this way?
It's a shortcut.

1754
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:20,032
It's the road that leads to
the quarry. I don't understand.

1755
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:33,212
Aunt Edith, what is this?

1756
01:47:33,214 --> 01:47:36,549
- You're frightening me.
- Don't be frightened.

1757
01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:45,891
Aunt Edith,
what are you doing?

1758
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:49,061
Aunt Edith!

1759
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:00,773
Oh, my god, Charles.
They're...

1760
01:48:00,775 --> 01:48:03,509
aunt Edith, stop! Stop!

1761
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:06,078
No, no!
Stop!

1762
01:48:07,114 --> 01:48:11,517
Stop the car, stop the car,
stop the car.

1763
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:22,862
No, no, no.
No.

1764
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:29,268
No, no, no.

1765
01:48:36,209 --> 01:48:38,244
Shh.

1766
01:48:42,148 --> 01:48:44,583
What did we do to her?

1767
01:48:44,585 --> 01:48:46,919
What did we do to her?
No, no, it's okay.

1768
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:50,723
It wasn't you.
It wasn't you.

1769
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:53,726
It wasn't you.
