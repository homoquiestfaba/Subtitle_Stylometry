00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,166
Zurella, come
to the 20th century?

185
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:08,666
I don't like your attitude,
young man.

186
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,332
What business is it of yours...
Dear, dear. Mr. Cooper,

187
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:14,042
I'm here to awaken the world.

188
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,291
JONATHAN: Awaken the world?
From what?

189
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:21,292
To bring magic back
into the lives of those

190
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,291
who have let
science and technology

191
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,833
cloud their perceptions.

192
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:32,292
Perceptions of the powers
which truly govern the universe

193
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,333
to believe in the unbelievable.

194
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,791
Oh, there was a time

195
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:52,832
when wizards commanded
the respect of kings

196
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,457
and all shared
an undisputed belief

197
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,417
in the mystical powers
which guided their lives.

198
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:11,042
The objects which you see
before you, Mr. Cooper,

199
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,499
are those magical, mystical,

200
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,292
wonders which I have
collected over the years.

201
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,791
And with them,
I shall allow people

202
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:29,583
to experience
that belief in magic again.

203
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:37,999
JONATHAN: You really believe
you are Merlin, don't you?

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,916
( LAUGHS ) Storeowner's
an eccentric old man

205
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:44,500
who suffers from delusions
of being a wizard.

206
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,250
MERLIN: I am, Mr. Cooper,
who I say I am.

207
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,499
JONATHAN: Sure you are, pal.
And I'm Lancelot.

208
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,457
Why, you insufferable rumpus.

209
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,416
MERLIN: Mr. Cooper,
I can assure you,

210
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,291
my intentions are
entirely honorable.

211
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,332
This is so beautiful.

212
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,624
I've never seen
anything like it.

213
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,167
It's a laurel,
a very special stone.

214
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,999
A wishing stone.

215
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,999
JONATHAN:
Come on.

216
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,332
For Pete's sake, Madeleine,
don't encourage them.

217
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,624
It's nothing more than a rock.

218
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,042
Make a wish, dear.

219
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,707
Madeleine, it's people like you

220
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,708
that allow this kind of
exploitation to go on.

221
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,417
A most endearing wish.

222
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,166
All right, I've seen enough.

223
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,291
I could be a sport about this.

224
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,166
If you're really Merlin,
prove it.

225
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,999
Show me something.

226
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,332
As they say, knock my socks off.

227
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,333
Ha-ha-ha!
We don't give demonstrations.

228
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,666
Sure you don't.

229
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,416
Listen to me, OB1.

230
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,582
Either you give me something
to write home about,

231
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,832
or your quaint little shop
is history.

232
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,457
Jonathan, let's just go.

233
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,999
Did you hear me, old man?

234
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,291
Do you know who I am?

235
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:37,249
I am the Supreme Being.

236
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,416
I chew places like this up
and spit them into the toilet.

237
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:44,291
So I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

238
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,582
You prove to me that you're
Merlin the Great Sorcerer,

239
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,457
or get off the pot.

240
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,332
For God's sake, Jonathan,
just drop it.

241
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,333
Leave these kind people alone.

242
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,063
Dear, why don't you
give him the book?

243
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,707
The book?

244
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,908
Yes, dear, the book.
Your book.

245
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,749
( WHISPERS )

246
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,332
What's going on?

247
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, Mr. Cooper,
I may have something for you

248
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:21,124
that will provide the proof
you seek.

249
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,958
JONATHAN:
Oh, yeah?

250
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,041
Looks like an old book.

251
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,958
MERLIN:
Oh, that it is, Mr.
Cooper.

252
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,624
It's a book of magic,

253
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,750
my own compilation
of spells and incantations.

254
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,416
More talk of magic?

255
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,874
I told you, the only kind of
magic I believe in

256
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,332
is the magic I have
in these fingers

257
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,332
to make this place...
( SNAPS FINGERS ) ...disappear.

258
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,707
Mr. Cooper, if you would
just take this book home

259
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,832
and read through it,
I assure you,

260
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,207
you will be thoroughly
satisfied.

261
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,667
MERLIN: I'm sure you will find
that it makes good reading.

262
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,667
JONATHAN: All right, you've
sparked my interest, old man.

263
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:15,249
I'll look through it,

264
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,749
and you'll trust me
to bring it back?

265
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,291
MERLIN:
Why certainly.

266
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,812
Oh, Mrs. Cooper,
please keep the stone.

267
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,291
MADELEINE:
Oh no, I couldn't.

268
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,958
Dear, it's a gift.

269
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,833
Thank you.

270
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,332
MERLIN:
You're welcome.

271
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,999
Come on, let's get out of here.

272
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,332
I'm sure the compilations
of a mad man

273
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,041
will make good reading.

274
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,292
Oh, and Mr. Cooper,
a few words of caution.

275
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:46,291
If you decide to dabble
with any of my spells,

276
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,832
for whatever reason,

277
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,083
be sure not to toy with any
that aren't entirely there.

278
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm afraid that over the years,

279
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,500
some of the pages
have become brittle

280
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,000
and sections
have been broken off.

281
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,333
So please, Mr. Cooper,

282
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:16,292
heed my words,
for your own sake.

283
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:32,166
GRANDFATHER: And so, Mr.
Cooper
took Merlin's book home.

284
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,999
Wait a minute,
what did Madeleine wish for?

285
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,332
Well, what do you think?

286
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,707
I don't know.

287
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,333
You'll figure it out.

288
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,457
I spoke to Dr. Collins.

289
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,249
Oh yeah, what did
that quack have to say?

290
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,957
Nothing.

291
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,291
Nothing that would concern you.

292
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,499
Oh, for Pete's sake, Madeleine.

293
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,291
Why is it so difficult for you

294
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,624
to show a little compassion
once in a while?

295
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,999
Or to be nice?

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,080
My God, just getting along
is a major accomplishment.

297
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:21,791
( READING ) Well, it would
appear that I too have succumbed

298
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,082
to the old man's charm

299
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,374
for I hold in my hand
a book of spells.

300
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,582
Merlin's book of spells
which no less

301
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,292
promises to make me
a true believer in magic.

302
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:35,749
Although I must admit,
the mere thought

303
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,350
of such a thing being real
is intriguing.

304
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,292
Oh, a warning.

305
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,133
"He beware who layeth sight
on pages within."

306
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,667
Nice touch.

307
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,333
Must be a fuse.

308
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,208
Okay, what do we have here?

309
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,792
Let's see, contents.

310
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,291
Spells, love potion, worthless.

311
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:08,332
Teleportation,
mmm, rejuvenation,

312
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,333
yes, we must stay young
and vital.

313
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:15,332
This is incredible.

314
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,833
What kind of mind spends hours
writing this crap?

315
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,332
Look at this gibberish,
typically in Latin.

316
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,082
Who was it that first
instilled the belief

317
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,999
that words, perhaps
in their purest form,

318
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,999
could actually
command the elements.

319
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,292
Take this special for example,
"to propel away.

320
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,375

321
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:52,332
That's what I get
for screwing around.

00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,249
Oh!

with this foolishness,

in the bedroom.

blaming each other.

361

So where's the spirit?

Anybody there?

363

commanding enough.

was to summon the spirit.

to point out.

406

that Jonathan's been doing,

Well, using one's
psychic powers to do magic

drains your life force
and causes you to age.

But it's common knowledge
among wizards.

412

the unsuspecting feline

from your reading?

901
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,999
Just a refresher.

902
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,374
I remembered that demons can
only be brought into this world

903
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:09,499
through someone
who already exists here.

904
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,666
They can't come on their own.

905
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:13,999
Sometimes demons
are brought here unwillingly,

906
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,332
causing them to be volatile
and hostile.

907
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:19,166
Well, aren't they already
volatile and hostile?

908
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,291
I mean, they are demons.

909
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:22,416
Yes. But they can be worse when
they're conjured

910
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:24,624
without their consent.

911
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:26,291
Look Adrian, I've been thinking.

912
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:28,291
My son just had a birthday,
and one of his presents

913
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:31,167
was this antique toy monkey.

914
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,333
Oh, I see.

915
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:39,000
Sit down right there, Dave.

916
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:45,374
You're not going to
like this, David,

917
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,167
but we have a very serious
situation here.

918
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,332
Now unfortunately,

919
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:52,832
I'm not going to be able
to deal with it personally

920
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,666
because of its nature;

921
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:56,707
you're going to have to
deal with it alone.

922
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:58,916
Why do I have to
deal with it alone?

923
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,291
Well, listen to me, David.

924
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,292
As a psychic, I have an aura
of a certain nature

925
01:09:01,293 --> 01:09:04,082
that the demon would
unquestionably sense.

926
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:07,332

into your house,

927
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,249

literally.

928
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,249

supposed to do?

929

about evil spirits.

930
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,499
Get that toy out of your house.

931
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,620
I have a feeling that's not
going to be so easy to do.

932

933
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,666

protect
me from the demon, huh?

935
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:26,999
Yes. Just keep it in your
possession at all times.

around my neck too?

01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,332
So, you sold it to her?

1077
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:27,291
Damn right. I would've
given her half my cart

1078
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:29,707
for 20 bucks.

1079
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,291
Well, did you get her name

1080
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:34,832
or where she lives?
Anything?

1081
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,708
Well actually, yeah.

1082
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:40,250
Her name's Marie Andrews.

1083
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:46,041
312 Maple Drive.

1084
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:49,166
Granted I don't usually
accept checks,

1085
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,000
but she looked
respectful enough.

1086
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:09,375
( CHATTERING )

1087
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:21,207
Oh, thank you, darling, so much!

1088
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:22,999
I'll give you a call.

1089
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,332
FEMALE DRIVER:
Oh, please do!

1090
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,333
Ok darling, alright.

1091
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:26,333
DRIVER: Bye-bye!

1092
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:27,667
Mary!

1093
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:30,875
Oh, my I've missed you!

1094
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,332
Welcome home!

1095
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:34,292
Oh, thank you so much!

1096
01:25:34,293 --> 01:25:35,791
Why didn't you call me?

1097
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:38,291
Oh well, Sarah...
I would have come to get you. (
GROANS ) Sand in here?

1098
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:40,291
Sarah was at the airport

1099
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:41,749
which worked out
just wonderfully.

1100
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:43,207
You have the best luck, I swear.

1101
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:45,249
Oh, tell me, how are you, Pete?

1102
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,957
Fine.
Oh, good.

1103
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,332
And do you have any new
old cars to tell me about?

1104
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,666
Well, I sold the old Chevy,

1105
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:51,667
and I'm gonna start
on the old Buick next.

1106
01:25:51,668 --> 01:25:53,041
Oh, great.
How is everything?

1107
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:55,166
Fine, except that son
of yours is a lousy cook.

1108
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:57,666
Oh! ( LAUGHS )

1109
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,291
And how was Hawaii?

1110
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:00,332
Wonderful!

1111
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,333
( LAUGHING )

1112
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,332
Well, Pete, I might just
tell him you know.

1113
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,582
Grandma!

1114
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,291
Oh, Michael!

1115
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:11,291
How are you, darling?

1116
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:12,292
Oh damn,
wouldn't you know it, Mary,

1117
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:13,999
there's my phone.
I'll talk to you later.

1118
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,416
All right, Pete.
Thank you so much!

1119
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:16,957
PETE: Welcome home.
Oh, thank you!

1120
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:18,666
Michael, how are you?

1121
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,416
Fine. Is that for me?

1122
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:21,999
DAVID: Is that you, Mom?
Yes!

1123
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,082
How was your birthday?

1124
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,042
Did you have a party?

1125
01:26:25,043 --> 01:26:26,332
Yeah. Can I open
my present now?

1126
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,332
Well, take it over to the table

1127
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,999
and wait till Dad comes.
Okay?

1128
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,167
Okay.

1129
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:37,332
DAVID: Mom!
MARY: Hi!

1130
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:38,999
Oh David!
What has happened to you?

1131
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,291
Don't even ask, Mom.

1132
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:42,499
Have you been in
an accident or something?

1133
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,291
Look, you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1134
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:45,707
Can I open my present now?

1135
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,166
Please, Grandma!
Please?

1136
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:48,291
Yes, dear, you may.

1137
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:49,292
David, are you sure
you're feeling all right?

1138
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:50,916
I'm sure, Mom, just fine.
I'm fine.

1139
01:26:50,917 --> 01:26:53,291
Hey, did you see how well
I took care of your plants?

1140
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:55,166
Oh, they're beautiful!

1141
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:56,332
I can't believe
how much they've grown!

1142
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:57,791
( LAUGHS )

1143
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,332
Dad, look!

1144
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:00,333
Isn't it, darling?

1145
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:06,999
Michael, go outside!

1146
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,332
David?

1147
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:10,167
Don't ask questions, Mom.

1148
01:27:10,168 --> 01:27:11,332
( BOTH TALKING
OVER EACH OTHER )

1149
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:12,916
David, David!

1150
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:15,291
Mom!

1151
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,292
Dad! Dad!

1152
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,500
Dad!

1153
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:24,416
DAVID: Open it!
MICHAEL: I can't!
David!

1154
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:25,499
Get out of the way, Michael!

1155
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,750
MICHAEL: Dad!

1156
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,332
DAVID:
Run faster! Go!

1157
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,291
Get in the car!

1158
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:34,541
Mom, there's no time
to explain now.

1159
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:35,999
Just get into the car!

1160
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Michael, get in...

1161
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:45,750
Oh! You found it.

1162
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:48,737
Sweetheart,
you can come home now.

1163
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:53,833
GRANDPA: And so with the monkey
back in Merlin's possession,

1164
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:58,708
Merlin could return home
with renewed hope.

1165
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:03,332
Of course
he'd still have to decide

1166
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:05,332
what to do with the monkey

1167
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:07,253
to ensure nothing like this
ever happened again.

1168
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:11,333
MERLIN:
I'll deal with you later.

1169
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:13,167
But for now,

1170
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:16,749
content that everything
was back to normal,

1171
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,333
Merlin could re-open his shop
and continue his quest

1172
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,875
to inspire the hopes
and dreams of all those

1173
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:28,292
whose lives would soon
touch his own.

1174
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:50,999
Goodnight, boy.

1175
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
My goodness, you've grown big.

1176
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:57,042
There you are.

1177
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:27,292
( MUSIC PLAYING )
