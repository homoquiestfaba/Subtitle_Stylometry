of 60 feet.

It is called
the sea unicorn

90
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,413

ivory Lance

from the lower mandible.

92

with the hardness of steel.

Are you saying a hole
in the scotia's hull

the land produced life forms
of enormous size

97
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,363

and more efficient

102
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,479
I believe
that those depths

or changed.

as "protoleviathans."

really possible?

protoleviathans exist.

We intend to follow
the concentration
of plankton

133
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,646
on the hypothesis
that a creature
such as we seek

134
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:05,683
would feed in the most
efficient manner,

135
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,754
which is of course

136
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:09,756
the large-scale
consumption of plankton.

137
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,828
You have to stand
on the bow to do this?

138
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,588
We'll be taking
measurements

139
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:16,452
by means of
interferometer readings.

140
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,281
Therefore we have to
see the plankton

141
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,145
before the ships
disturbs it.

142
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,045
And this will lead me
to the monster?

143
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,047

is correct,

144
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,083

a whaler aboard

stationed in the bow

to call on him.

00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:35,017
but none so precious
as your company.

352
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,986
Miss aronnax.

353
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,162
Please, professor.

354
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:47,029
I hope you'll be
happy here.

355
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,791
You are free,
of course,

356
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,793
to pursue your scientific
inquiries.

357
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,519
I think you may find
the nautilus

358
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,866
interesting enough
for the purpose.

359
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,799
Will Mr. Land be
joining US for dinner?

360
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,870
No.

361
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,700
Mr. Land insists
on remaining in
his cabin.

362
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,046
May I see him?

363
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,772
In due course.

364
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,499
Please,
you must be famished.
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:11,019
This looks delicious.

366
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,883
Stewed pork,
if I'm not mistaken?

367
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,161
It may look and taste
like stewed pork,
but in fact

368
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,439
it is dolphin liver
cunningly prepared.

369
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:20,235
And those cutlets are
filet of sea turtle.

370
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,651
This is sea cucumber salad

371
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:25,482
and the excellent jam,
miss aronnax,

372
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:28,519
is made from sea anemone.

373
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:31,246
All of this food
is from the sea?

374
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,145
We who sail the nautilus
are sustained

375
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,285
by the oceans
of the world

376
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,391
in everything.

377
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,015
These clothes
we're wearing--

378
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,810
the material is
unfamiliar to me.

379
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,812
Is it from the sea too?

380
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,608
Trust a woman to notice.

381
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,610
The cloth is woven

382
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:53,372
from the silken filaments
of the byssus fan mussel,

383
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,788
strong enough
to resist a hurricane.

384
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:58,307
Why do you choose
to live this way?

385
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:01,897
And who are those people who have followed you into this exile?

386
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,105
Sophie!

387
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,591
This isn't exile.

388
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:09,318
This is liberation.

389
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:12,701
Mobilis in mobile, miss aronnax.

390
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:15,255
Free in a free world.

391
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,429
Nemo: Exactly.

392
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:19,915
I must ask you a question,
captain Nemo,

393
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,642
or risk perhaps
misunderstanding you.

394
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:25,369
You have used
this extraordinary
creation of yours

395
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,890
to attack unarmed shipping
in the north Atlantic.

396
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:33,722
That is something
we should speak about

397
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:35,448
when perspectives
have shifted enough

398
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:37,795
to allow
proper understanding.
Excuse me.

399
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,141
May I please see
Mr. Land?

400
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,418
[ Door closes ]

401
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:35,922
Which way
to Mr. Land's cabin?

402
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:49,099
Hello?

403
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,966
It's like bathing
in liquid light,
isn't it?

404
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,833
May I offer you
some hot coffee?

405
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,284
Thank you.

406
00:27:54,534 --> 00:27:57,986
I can understand
how your museum

407
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:01,990
has come to contain
such natural treasures.

408
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,992
But how did you come by
these pictures?

409
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,270
Some of them
I have seen in museums.

410
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:09,170
That would be before they
sank in transit.

411
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:12,760
You collected all these
from sunken ships?

412
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:15,590
And countless others
in my storehouses beneath
the seven seas,

413
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:18,282
gold, jewels...

414
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:24,219
The finest clothes--

415
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,601
all at your disposal.

416
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:31,226
And did you sink
those ships?

417
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:34,954
My mission is not
a criminal one,
miss aronnax.

418
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:37,474
So you didn't
sink them?

419
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,546
The nautilus is not
a pirate ship.

420
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:45,275
I'm sorry
if I offend you,

421
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,450
but it seems to me
a fair question,

422
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:51,108
given your propensity
to ram innocent ships.

423
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:55,250
I have never sunk a ship,
innocent or otherwise.

424
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,494
And I'm not in the least
offended.

425
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,669
Indeed, I find
your fearless passion
to know the truth

426
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,293
intoxicating.

427
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,779
I always dreamed
of finding a woman
with a first-rate mind,

428
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:10,783
someone who is capable
of understanding me.

429
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:15,823
And even in this

430
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:18,032
the sea has not failed
to provide.

431
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,485
Do you mind if I examine
some of your exhibits?

432
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,074
You needn't ask.

433
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,909
Some of them are
absolutely extraordinary.

434
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:04,181
Professor aronnax,
how kind of you to join me.

435
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:05,700
I must be dreaming.

436
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:08,289
I assure you
everything is quite real.

437
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,533
As a matter of fact,
I was just reading your
masterful work again.

438
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:13,708
I consult it
constantly.

439
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:15,848
I am honored, sir.

440
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,264
Your library
is extraordinary.

441
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:23,787
How many volumes do you
have here, captain Nemo?

442
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,858
Thousands all told.

443
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,826
But the books you see here
are merely those

444
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,482
I like to have
near at hand,

445
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:31,139
such as yours.

446
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:33,555
They're my only remaining link with the world above.

447
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,764
I bought my last book

448
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,801
the day the nautilus set sail.

449
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,803
Since that day I assume

450
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,875
mankind neither
thinks nor writes
anything of consequence.

451
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,810
I am simply overwhelmed.

452
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:51,021
This room and this ship,

453
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:53,161
how deep can it go,
if I may ask you, sir?

454
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:55,267
I have yet
to test its limit.

455
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,165
But you are
wondering perhaps

456
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,133
whether there will be
an opportunity to test

457
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,238
your famous deepwater theory of static evolution?

458
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,620
Precisely so.

459
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,622
You may depend upon it,
professor.

460
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:08,073
I have some
rather interesting

461
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:10,213
scientific volumes
in my personal quarters.

462
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:11,731
Perhaps you'd like
to see them?

463
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,768
- Oh, yes.
- Please.

464
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,819
Mr. Land?

465
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,720
Ned, are you here?

466
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:11,412
Sophie.

467
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:16,141
- You all right?
- Yes, we both are.

468
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,487
Are you?

469
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:20,559
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

470
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:22,388
You shouldn't be here.

471
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,666
I don't understand.
He said you were resting.

472
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,842
Well, I'm not exactly
resting, Sophie.

473
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:30,293
I mean, this is a brig.
See, unlike you
and your father--

474
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,847
[ door rattles, footsteps ]

475
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:34,504
Don't let them
see you here.

476
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,506
I'm not leaving you here.

477
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:39,992
Go before they find you.

478
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:41,718
Go.

479
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,415
Sophie, we cannot be
making demands.

480
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,004
We must appeal
to Nemo's better nature.

481
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,386
We mustn't make him regret having taken US aboard.

482
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,181
I will not stand
for this treatment of ned.

483
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:58,217
Sophie, Sophie,
lower your voice.

484
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,945
I am not afraid of him.

485
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,879
I am not one of these
ensigns of his.

486
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:09,194
You will listen to me.

487
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:11,437
He is a genius.

488
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:13,681
And I believe
he is a decent man.

489
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:15,062
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

490
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:18,582
We must give him the opportunity to provide that.

491
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:15,984
The secret is sodium.

492
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:20,299
Sodium, not zinc?

493
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:23,854
Sodium Mercury
rhumkorff batteries,
to be precise.

494
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,236
As the Mercury
in the amalgam
is never used up,

495
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:28,273
only the sodium
requires replenishment.

496
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:30,482
And since there is
an endless supply

497
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,346
of sodium
in seawater...

498
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,038
...you have
an endless supply
of energy for the nautilus.

499
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,972
- Precisely.
- Amazing.

500
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,664
But I don't understand
how you were able

501
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,598
to build all this
without anyone
finding you out.

502
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:47,430
That wasn't as difficult
as you may imagine,

503
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:49,708
only carefully considered.

504
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,609
Miss aronnax.

505
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,956
You look beautiful.

506
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:08,623
I must insist
I see Mr. Land.

507
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:18,150
Your concern for him
is quite admirable.

508
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:19,979
However...

509
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,574
- Captain.
- Mr. Land.

510
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:30,438
Good to see you,
Mr. Land.

511
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:32,302
Are you well?

512
00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:34,373
I'm fine--

513
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:37,065
fine now that
I'm out of the brig.

514
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,378
Mr. Land had insisted
upon being treated

515
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:41,587
as a prisoner of war,
obliging me to comply.

516
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,934
But this troubled
my principles greatly.

517
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:45,936
So I've decided
to extend him

518
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,421
the freedom
of the nautilus

519
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:50,009
in the hope
that he will not
abuse my trust.

520
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,839
Well, that's wonderful.

521
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:55,187
- Mobilis in mobile.
- Mobilis in mobile.

522
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:56,740
Whatever.

523
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,816
You know he's
interested in you.

524
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,646
I'm aware of it.

525
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,682
Oh, you are?

526
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,033
Why are you
so concerned, ned?

527
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:16,967
- What, do you
have to ask?

about sailing men?

Not quite every port.

that stupid, are you?

you'd like to go with me.

Will we go on land?

00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:20,436
Hardly.

Would you like to?

559
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:40,041
It sounds fascinating.

You are fearless.

Since entering the nautilus
I've lived with
my loneliness.

I'd abandoned all hope
it would ever be otherwise.

to you this way:

I don't think that was
joy in Nemo's face
when I showed up again.

629

If he was responsible
for what happened,

630
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:17,393
why didn't he
tell his divers

00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:19,188
to take a minute longer
getting to you?

632
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,501
Because he couldn't
have you thinking
he was behind it all,

He is not the monster
you make him out to be.

Don't trust him, Sophie.

That's exactly how
he thinks.

He is mad.

00:50:45,663 --> 00:50:47,734
Don't let him
blind you.

641
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:49,667
You have to see him
for what he is.

Remarkable.

643

despite all our ingenuity,

satisfactory smoke,
I think.

650
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:25,806
A man shares confidences
with a friend, professor,

651
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:30,087
and he doesn't need but one
if he chooses wisely.

652
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,192
Are you not surrounded
by friends?

653
00:51:32,227 --> 00:51:34,401
I am surrounded,
as you put it,
by followers.

654

There is a difference.

00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:41,132
I would consider it an honor
to be your friend.

If I take you
into my confidence,

657

you are bound to me
forever.

658
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:48,139
Do you really wish
to carry such a burden?

659
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:50,900
It is no burden
to be a true friend.

660
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:55,698
It also means
one hasa true friend.

661

I offer you
my hand, sir.

662

came to my small country

00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,739

in my stranglehold,

676
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:55,206
I shall demand
my country back

677
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:57,174
as the price
of releasing my grip.

678
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:15,985
What is it, ned?

679
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,126
Uh, I wanted to say
I was sorry for earlier.

680
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:20,921
That's all right, ned.

681
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:25,340
Is there something else?

682
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:27,445
Yeah.

683
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:31,691
You know, when I was
out there, i--

684
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:34,970
well, I'd pretty much
made my peace.

685
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,041
I only had one regret,

686
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:39,561
just one.

687
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:44,186
What is it
you want of me, ned?

688
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,224
Another conquest
to brag about
in the taverns?

689
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,987
You know, I think
there is something

690
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,885
- you should know about me.
- What?

691
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,163
I'm a married man.

692
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:58,200
- What?
- Yeah.

693
00:54:00,306 --> 00:54:03,205
It was a long time ago.

694
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:08,141
Matter of fact,
I'd just got my
journeyman's ticket.

695
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,419
I met her in a bar
in Singapore.

Her name was Kate.

697
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:14,872
She was fiery.

698
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:17,288
It was love at first sight

699
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:20,153
and I was prepared
to give up the sea.

700
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:27,160
But after a while
I got restless,

701
00:54:27,194 --> 00:54:29,852
so I signed on

had them laid in gold.

around her neck

for forgiveness.

01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:03,536
I'm inclined
to agree with him.

882
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:05,780
Well, it's nice to know
you're thinking about me.

883
01:07:07,471 --> 01:07:09,784
I am you friend, ned,

884
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:12,097
if you'll allow me to be.

885
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:41,126
There.

886
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,549
They've locked ned up

887
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,551
like a common criminal.

888
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:54,070
He behaves like one.

889
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,831
It was entirely predictable.

890
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:58,315
He's just a fool.

891
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,904
Sophie, we have to let captain Nemo know

892
01:08:00,938 --> 01:08:02,906
that we at least
are capable

893
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,978
of understanding
the objective situation.

894
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:09,982
What is the objective
situation, father?

895
01:08:10,016 --> 01:08:13,089
That we have to make
the best of things.

896
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:18,266
You want me
to marry him?

897
01:08:21,442 --> 01:08:23,927
I would not
stand in your way.

898
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:30,347
I see.

899
01:08:30,382 --> 01:08:32,522
Sophie, Sophie,

900
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:36,319
Sophie, I'm trying to do
what's best for you.

901
01:08:38,217 --> 01:08:41,289
What's best for me, father,

902
01:08:41,324 --> 01:08:44,603
or what's best for you?

903
01:08:44,637 --> 01:08:49,159
Maybe you're the one
that's being seduced.

904
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:03,104
Captain Nemo,

905
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,141
I must speak with you.

906
01:09:07,764 --> 01:09:10,180
You look troubled,
professor.

907
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,562
But there is
nothing to fear,
I assure you.

908
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,669
I wish to speak to you
about Sophie.

909
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,086
Do you bring me
good news?

910
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:22,296
I have come to do my duty
as her father.

911
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:26,196
I have come to ask you
to withdraw your suit.

912
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:28,302
- [ Siren wailing ]
- Man: A lookout warning, sir.

913
01:09:37,276 --> 01:09:39,830
Stand by to engage
the Lincoln, gentlemen.

914
01:09:39,865 --> 01:09:41,522
Man:
Aye aye, sir.

915
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,634
What is it, father?
What's happening?

916
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,603
I don't know.
I think it's
the Abraham Lincoln.

917
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:55,501
Sophie.

918
01:09:55,536 --> 01:09:57,193
Sophie, no.

919
01:09:57,227 --> 01:09:58,711
Sophie!

920
01:10:16,453 --> 01:10:18,697
I demand to know
what's going on.

921
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:22,114
Captain farragut.

922
01:10:22,148 --> 01:10:25,359
I made a poor impression at our last encounter.

923
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:27,878
I intend to rectify that this time.

924
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:32,228
What is it
that you want,
captain Nemo?

925
01:10:35,645 --> 01:10:38,234
Justice.

926
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:50,660
Ready the dahlgren.

927
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:00,394
Aim dahlgren.

928
01:11:04,363 --> 01:11:06,469
Fire!

929
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:14,753
Weapons at the forward!

930
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:17,583
Aim and fire!

931
01:11:19,344 --> 01:11:22,105
You can send
your mightiest,

932
01:11:22,139 --> 01:11:25,246
but I will have
what is mine.

933
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,042
All hands
to the bow!

934
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:29,664
Fire at will!

935
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:34,980
Come on, farragut.

936
01:11:35,014 --> 01:11:38,086
Fire at will!

937
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:41,366
Here I am.

938
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,160
Come on, farragut.

939
01:11:45,646 --> 01:11:47,958
Yes!

940
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:49,891
Dahlgren, reload!

941
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:55,069
Father, he's going to
sink her.

942
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:58,314
It's all right, Sophie.
Remember, he only
wounds them

943
01:11:58,348 --> 01:12:01,317
and sends them home
with their tails
between their legs.

944
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,839
Not this time.

945
01:12:30,587 --> 01:12:32,140
It's all right.
It's all right.

946
01:12:32,175 --> 01:12:33,418
It's all right.

947
01:13:33,098 --> 01:13:34,548
Brandy?

948
01:13:44,661 --> 01:13:45,973
Murderer!

949
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:49,839
No, Sophie, warrior.

950
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:51,806
Why, Nemo?

951
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:54,291
Why?

952
01:13:54,326 --> 01:13:57,398
Why do you think I didn't
sink the Abraham Lincoln

953
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,780
during our
first encounter?

954
01:13:59,814 --> 01:14:01,540
When she
limped back to port,

955
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:04,405
my enemies finally gave me
their full attention,

956
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,165
as I intended.

957
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,134
But they still thought
they could defeat me,

958
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:12,724
so they sent her back
to destroy me.

959
01:14:12,758 --> 01:14:15,174
Well, now they will
understand

960
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:17,901
they can send
all the navies
of the world--

961
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:22,043
I will not be defeated.

962
01:14:22,078 --> 01:14:23,562
How many men died
on that ship?

963
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:28,912
I'm not entirely sure,

964
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:31,501
but a frigate of
the Abraham Lincoln class

965
01:14:31,536 --> 01:14:33,572
would carry
a minimum complement

966
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:37,403
of 650 men.

967
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:39,923
And you feel nothing?

968
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:41,925
Quite the contrary,
Sophie.

969
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,445
I feel a great joy.

970
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,345
Sophie.
Sophie.

971
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,002
A moment, professor...

972
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:53,937
My friend.

973
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:58,770
That ship fired
upon me unprovoked,

974
01:14:58,804 --> 01:15:01,289
did it not?

975
01:15:05,121 --> 01:15:07,468
That was an act of war,
was it not?

976
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:13,267
You knew I was at war.

977
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:14,751
I told you

978
01:15:14,786 --> 01:15:16,615
the night you pledged me
your loyalty.

979
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:19,135
Do you remember,

980
01:15:19,169 --> 01:15:21,309
my friend?

981
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:31,837
And where are you
taking US now?

982
01:15:31,872 --> 01:15:36,255
I have some business
in the north Atlantic.

983
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,603
But our course takes US

984
01:15:38,637 --> 01:15:40,915
near the Caribbean
trench

985
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:45,023
with depths of up to
5000 fathoms.

986
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:49,475
There,
as I promised,

987
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,477
you will have
an opportunity to prove

988
01:15:51,512 --> 01:15:54,860
your theory
of static evolution.

989
01:15:56,862 --> 01:16:01,073
Consider it the reward
of friendship.

990
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,146
To science!

991
01:16:07,252 --> 01:16:11,394
I cannot raise my glass
with you, captain Nemo,

992
01:16:11,428 --> 01:16:14,570
not to science,
nor to anything else.

993
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:28,791
I wish to see
Mr. Land.

994
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,832
Oh my god.
What have they done to you?

995
01:16:35,867 --> 01:16:39,353
When the alarm sounded
they came straight in
to chain me.

996
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:41,458
Did he sink her?

997
01:16:41,493 --> 01:16:44,047
Yes.

998
01:16:45,531 --> 01:16:47,637
He's the devil himself.

999
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:54,264
I didn't let myself see
what was so plain to you.

1000
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,335
- I'm sorry.
- Is it plain to you now?

1001
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,441
And to your father?

1002
01:16:58,475 --> 01:17:01,237
Yes.

1003
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:03,377
We have to escape.

1004
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:04,585
We have to warn
the world.

1005
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,587
Then don't waste any more
precious time with me.

1006
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,278
You stay by Nemo's side,
both of you,

1007
01:17:08,313 --> 01:17:09,763
keep your eyes
and your ears open

1008
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:11,488
and you look for a chance,
any chance.

1009
01:17:11,523 --> 01:17:12,973
I don't want to go
anywhere near that man.

1010
01:17:13,007 --> 01:17:15,596
Then we will remain
prisoners,

1011
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,185
all of US.

1012
01:17:18,219 --> 01:17:20,946
I'll do
whatever I have to.

1013
01:18:06,509 --> 01:18:09,201
Why haven't
you released him
from those chains?

1014
01:18:09,236 --> 01:18:11,721
It's inhuman.

1015
01:18:11,756 --> 01:18:15,552
I am willing to release
Mr. Land altogether.

1016
01:18:15,587 --> 01:18:18,935
You are?

1017
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:22,905
Well, secrecy is
no longer necessary.

1018
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:25,390
After I cut off
the old world
from the new,

1019
01:18:25,424 --> 01:18:28,117
I'll put Mr. Land ashore
with my terms of surrender.

1020
01:18:32,569 --> 01:18:34,399
And what about
my father and me?

1021
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,783
Your father too.

1022
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:41,061
He will represent
my interests

1023
01:18:41,095 --> 01:18:44,305
and speak for my...
Good character.

1024
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:47,688
And what are
your plans for me?

1025
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:01,875
Don't be frightened,
Sophie.

1026
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:04,291
A glorious destiny
awaits you.

1027
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:32,560
Nemo: Good god.

1028
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:34,666
Sophie:
A protoleviathan!

1029
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,229
Get your father.

1030
01:20:02,245 --> 01:20:04,972
Well, professor,

1031
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:07,009
it seems you were right.

1032
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:11,737
Sophie: Whatever it is,
it's some kind of
pre-cetacean.

1033
01:20:11,772 --> 01:20:13,463
Aronnax:
So it would seem.

1034
01:20:13,498 --> 01:20:15,741
Have no fear.

1035
01:20:15,776 --> 01:20:19,297
We will direct
all our electrical power
to the hull.

1036
01:20:25,268 --> 01:20:27,512
Whatever it is,
it'll let go

1037
01:20:27,546 --> 01:20:29,169
as soon as it gets
a taste of this.

1038
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,786
It will soon tire
of this game.

1039
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:03,272
With all due respect,
captain,

1040
01:21:03,306 --> 01:21:04,998
I don't think so.

1041
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:06,931
What do you mean?

1042
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:11,556
This creature would be
completely unevolved
in any way.

1043
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:14,179
It will be days, even weeks,

1044
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:17,389
before it gives up trying to break open our shell.

1045
01:21:20,737 --> 01:21:23,154
How much air is left?
A day's worth?

1046
01:21:23,188 --> 01:21:25,915
Half a day at most.

1047
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,055
We were just about
to surface.

1048
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:30,368
Are you certain this thing
will not let US go?

1049
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:33,060
I am.

1050
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,582
Then we must kill it.

1051
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:41,068
I'll arm my best divers.
Stay here.

1052
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:43,691
It will take more than
your Nemo guns.

1053
01:21:43,726 --> 01:21:47,419
You underestimate
the concentrated firepower

1054
01:21:47,454 --> 01:21:50,008
of my weapons,
professor.

1055
01:22:03,366 --> 01:22:05,334
Now you shall see,
professor,

1056
01:22:05,368 --> 01:22:07,957
what my Nemo guns
can do in combination.

1057
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,805
- My god!
- What's happening?

1058
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,842
