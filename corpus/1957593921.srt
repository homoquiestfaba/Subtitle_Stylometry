123
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,236

00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,393
- [Hannah] What?

185
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:57,226
- Seriously, pull over.

186
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,178
- [Kane] Don't vomit in
the car, hang on a second.

187
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:59,172
- [Hannah] Just, Kane, pull over.

188
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,844
- [Kane] I can't stop here.

189
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:01,677
- [Hannah] Kane, pull over!

190
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:02,781
- Please, just stop.

191
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,838
(splashing)

192
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,165
- I don't wanna fucking hear that shit.

193
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,986
She's been in and out of
shit for like a month.

194
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:09,819
- Kane.

195
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,593
She has just had a car accident.

196
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,104
She's homeless.

197
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,881
- And then she gets fucked up
and then she tells me, like,

198
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:15,958
- Just for this weekend.

199
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,959
- [Kane] I don't wanna hear anymore.

200
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,792
- Just for this weekend.

201
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,188
- [Katherine] Hannah, can you
bring me some water, please?

202
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:21,187
- Yeah yeah yeah.

203
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,317
Hold on, where's your water bottle?

204
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,319
- Don't give her that one.

205
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,819
That's mine, dude.

206
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:30,535
- I am so nervous.

207
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:35,084
I don't know why, I don't know why.

208
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,139
- [Kane] You haven't seen him in so.

209
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,343
(squealing)

210
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

211
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,333
- So I smell like dick,
where's the spliff?

212
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,314
No, I'm kidding. (chuckling)

213
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:11,564
(growling)

214
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,857
- [Hannah] Okay, see how
much you can take it.

215
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:17,690
- [Conner] All right.

216
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,523
- Okay.

217
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:19,843
- That's what she said.

218
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:22,322
Katherine, why are you sitting back there?

219
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:23,507
Took you that long to--

220
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:25,288
- 'Cause Bruv is sitting in the chair.

221
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,416
- [Hannah] So oblivious.

222
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,249
- [Conner] Bruv!

223
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,301
(screeching)

224
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,384
- Yeah, dude!

225
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,586
- [Conner] That made so
much more sense, right,

226
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:32,673
cause, yeah because.

227
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:33,944
- [Katherine] Conner, you didn't even see

228
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:34,946
he was sitting there?

229
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:35,793
- [Hannah] The whole time.

230
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,448
- [Conner] I was so excited about you.

231
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,332
- [Kane] So dude, San Francisco.

232
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,496
Ready for your audition?

233
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:41,659
- We'll see, I mean.

234
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,992
I'm gonna go and we'll have a look at it

235
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,026
and then um,

236
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,482
- [Hannah] No, and then
we'll audition, get in.

237
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:49,494
- Of course audition.

238
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:50,931
Of course get in.

239
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,925
- [Hannah] Of course.

240
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:52,929
- Of course.

241
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:53,950
- [Kane] That part's a given.

242
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,872
- [Hannah] No, that's a given.

243
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,187
- Very hard to get in.

244
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,515
So I don't know about that.

245
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:58,360
- [Hannah] What, what do you mean?

246
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,193
- [Kane] Is it really?

247
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:00,026
- Yeah it is.

248
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:04,484
San Francisco is Royal Ballet,
English National Ballet,

249
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:06,507
San Francisco Ballet, Australia
Ballet, Boston Ballet.

250
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,890
- Yeah, but you're brilliant.

251
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,939
You're brilliant so that's
not gonna be a problem.

252
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,783
- But I wouldn't get
your hopes up too much.

253
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:14,533
- Oh, by the way.

254
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,393
I actually, I had started already looking

255
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:21,374
for apartments and stuff
but this is the schedule.

256
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:22,881
This is the schedule because
you've gotta move over

257
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:25,080
once you get in quite quickly.

258
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,653
So I've got a whole package in my bag

259
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,189
but this is just for the trip.

260
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,659
And then, yeah, yeah.

261
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:33,372
- [Conner] Thanks, sis.

262
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,205
- You're welcome.

263
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,038
- [Conner] Thanks.

264
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:35,871
- [Kane] She's very organized.

265
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:36,741
- She's super, super pumped.

266
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,574
- [Kane] Super pumped.

267
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:38,407
- Super pumped.

268
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,240
- [Hannah] Duh.

269
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,238
- Duh?

270
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:44,054
- [Hannah] We might be
living in the same state.

271
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:49,054
♪ Surely everything can wait ♪

272
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,448
♪ Just look cold and of money ♪

273
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:57,935
- Okay, okay.

274
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:59,683
I know I keep bothering you about this

275
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,651
but I just like, I don't understand

276
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,294
because like he, okay

277
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:04,492
so we're really sorry about last night

278
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:05,630
and then he was like,

279
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,313
it's okay, shit happens.

280
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,179
And then he's like
asking me for his jacket

281
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,974
and asking us to like leave it out.

282
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:13,013
And so then I'm telling him

283
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,039
that we can't leave it out for him

284
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,490
because we're like on the road.

285
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,806
And I was like I'll just give
it to you when we're back in,

286
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:19,659
when I get back in town.

287
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,433
I mean we could go to
the movies or something.

288
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:24,370
He's like, oh can one of
your friends drop it off?

289
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,352
Like, can one of your
friends leave it outside?

290
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:28,807
I'm like no, we're on the road.

291
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:29,759
- Katherine, I don't know, I don't know.

292
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,592
Why are you asking me?

293
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:31,425
- No, but I don't get it

294
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:34,793
because then he sent me
like a real cute emoji.

295
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,892
- [Hannah] I'm so hungry.

296
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:37,725
- [Katherine] Me too.

297
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:39,045
Let's get in already.

298
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,793
- [Kane] Yes, I'm getting
us in, I'm getting us in.

299
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,660
- [Hannah] Go to the cafe for pizza.

300
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,376
- Just, get out.

301
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,216
Just, oh Jesus.
- Oh my god, it's so pink.

302
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,466
(laughing)

303
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,566
This is cool.

304
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,629
(laughing)

305
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:57,462
Okay.

306
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,631
Hey guess what.

307
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,141
I'm testing for a role next
week for a big TV show.

308
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,141
- [Conner] No fucking way!

309
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,380
- Yes, yes, I think I've got the role

310
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,404
'cause it's just a model.

311
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,237
- [Katherine] What's in the box?

312
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,070
- [Hannah] What?

313
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,092
- Um, oh, just um some stuff

314
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:13,925
for a little shoot we're gonna do.

315
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:17,303
Woo!

316
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,394
So I need to take some
photos for a film pitch

317
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,476
and you guys are gonna help me, all right?

318
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:23,643
- And oh, just a question.

319
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,846
There's only one bed.

320
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:28,768
- Yeah, well this was
kind of the best room

321
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,912
for what I'm trying to do, so.

322
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:34,161
I just figured we would.
- Where are they gonna sleep?

323
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,351
- Well, see I thought
ahead, I brought us the,

324
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,473
- The heavy mattress I was carrying.

325
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:40,498
- Brought us the air mattress,

326
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,575
that's what that was.

327
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,263
- So are they gonna sleep in the same bed?

328
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:44,403
- Oh I could sleep on the couch.

329
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,841
- We could share one, I don't care.

330
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,412
I mean, whatever.

331
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:48,434
- All right, all right.

332
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,861
- Okay, whatever works is fine.

333
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,861
- Okay, okay cool, okay.

334
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,414
(light music)

335
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,149
(giggling)

336
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,455
- Like, oh no, my film's gonna fall apart

337
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:00,926
if we don't get this test footage

338
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:02,990
that I never told you about.

339
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,745
And then like two hours
later he'll be like

340
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,246
guys, that footage was great.

341
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:09,020

- [Hannah] Hold on.

354
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:38,746
- [Kane] Can I help?

355
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:39,579
- [Conner] No.

356
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,754
- [Kane] Can I help?

357
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:41,587
- [Hannah And Katherine] No, No.

358
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:43,773
- Let me help, I'll get it done faster.

359
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:44,606
Let me help.

360
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:45,617
- Kane, it's broken.

361
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:46,450
- Yeah, it's broken.

362
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,289
- So we're just gonna
have to shoot around it.

363
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,322
- [Katherine] Yeah, just leave it.

364
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:49,603
- No, we can't shoot around it.

365
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,436
- Yes we can.

366
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,353
- No we can't, we need to get this.

367
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:56,134
Just.

368
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,167
- [Hannah] Wait, where are the heels?

369
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,000
- What are you gonna do about that?

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,046
- Katherine, do you
know where my heels are?

371
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,169
- What are you gonna do about the dress?

372
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:01,177
- Nothing, Kane.

373
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,538
You're gonna have to shoot around it.

374
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:04,930
- I can't shoot around
it, it's hanging off you.

375
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,836
You look like you're fucking fat!

376
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,326
Look like, because of the dress.

377
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:12,723
Oh don't give, come on, it's, come on.

378
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,544
- Fuck you, way to kill
my self-confidence, Kane.

379
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,673
Way to, I'm doing you a favor

380
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,777
and you call me fucking fat, well done!

381
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:21,743
(jazzy music)

382
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:22,742
- Watch it.

383
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,841
Were kind of doing like
a Breakfast at Tiffany's.

384
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:26,458
- Wait, is the reason why my dress is open

385
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,253
is because he's trying to like seduce me?

386
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:29,112
- Yes, turn around.

387
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,097
No, no, there's no choking, no choking.

388
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:32,347
Hannah, Hannah.

389
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:34,260
Fuck, you're drunk.

390
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,481
If you hadn't been drinking the whole time

391
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,481
you'll be listening to me.

392
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,073
Can you please?

393
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:39,296
- [Hannah] Yeah!

394
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,655
Party time.

395
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:44,193
I didn't even put my shoes on, whoops.

396
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:45,191
- [Kane] Katherine, just look at me here.

397
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,474
- [Hannah] Why does she
need to sit on his lap?

398
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,397
- Conner, you're tickling my neck.

399
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:49,264
- [Hannah] Kane.

400
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,097
(camera clicking)

401
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,387
- [Kane] I've gotta send them off.

402
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,796
- This is my family holiday.

403
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,933
But it's all out.

404
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,206
- Hannah, you told me
that you would do this.

405
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:57,587
- Guys, we're wrapped, we're wrapped.

406
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,464
Congratulations.

407
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,639
Wrap on set.

408
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,472
Well done.

409
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:02,922
- Hannah, stop.

410
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:04,374
- Katherine, just ignore her.

411
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,201
She does this when she drinks too much.

412
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:07,425
Can you just sit down?

413
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,426
- Kane, I never drink.

414
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,838
- But when you do you fucking hammer in.

415
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,320
For some reason it's like
some coping mechanism.

416
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,322
- I wonder why.

417
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:15,578
'Cause my boyfriend calls
me fat all the time.

418
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,056
- I don't call you fat all the time.

419
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,837
- Okay come on, let's
just take the picture--

420
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,083
- Hannah can you please come over here?

421
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,130
- Hannah, be careful.
- Yeah I'm done.

422
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,866
I'm done, I'm done.

423
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:24,916
I'm done.

424
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:25,975
- Are you serious?

425
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:26,978
- [Hannah] Yeah, I'm good.

426
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:27,811
- Are you being serious right now?

427
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:28,900
- [Conner] She's done with the bottle.

428
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,931
- [Katherine] Hannah, come on.

429
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:30,846
(Conner laughing)

430
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,251
- [Kane] I thought you'd
wanna be on this thing.

431
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,497
- How many of these do we have?

432
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,794
- You don't even care if I fail this.

433
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:36,797
- You pick on me all the time.

434
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:37,999
- Do you know if I don't
get these photos off

435
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,948
do you know, do you know?

436
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,551
- Katherine, where's the wine?

437
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,152
- I don't know, just you have to--

438
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:45,153
- God!

439
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,445
Do I have to find it myself?

440
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,278
- We'll just let you guys settle it.

441
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:48,284
Just chill out.
- Where is it?

442
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,490
I need it.

443
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,103
- [Kane] Calm down, calm down.

444
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,867
- [Hannah] No, you calm down!

445
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,319
You've been picking on me--

446
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,097
- [Kane] Don't point that corkscrew at me.

447
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,460
- Oh, oh my god I'm gonna stab you

448
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,520
in the heart with a corkscrew.

449
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,270
(waves crashing)

450
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,319
- So, um, I was thinking that like

451
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,532
I probably won't see you
dance before you go, right?

452
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:12,865
- No, you won't.

453
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,131
- What if you were to dance for me now?

454
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:20,845
- Where?

455
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:22,153
- Here.

456
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:22,986
- Where?

457
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:23,819
- Here.

458
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:24,954
- Where?

459
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:25,977
On the concrete?

460
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:27,432
You want me to fucking break
my shins on the concrete here?

461
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,890
- Oh, come on.

462
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,471
You don't have to like do like
the fanciest shit you know.

463
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,195
- [Conner] Dude, look at all the pigeons.

464
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,319
- Oh my god, it's daa--

465
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:36,505
- Do you want me to
dance with the pigeons?

466
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,151
- No, please don't dance with the pigeons.

467
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:39,151
- You don't wanna dance with the pigeons?

468
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,075
- Don't dance with the pigeons.

469
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:40,908
- There they go.

470
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,604
- I'm like legit scared of birds.

471
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:44,620
Dude, look, this looks like a stage.

472
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,039
Okay, this is too perfect.

473
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,753
Come on, I feel like we literally
just walked on to a stage.

474
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:49,755
- All right, fine.

475
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:50,756
Want me to dance?

476
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,762
- Yes, I want you to dance.

477
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:52,891
Oh shit.

478
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:53,724
(birds flapping)

479
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:54,911
- [Conner] But I'm gonna have
to get naked for the pigeons.

480
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,321
'cause I can't dance in these.

481
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,319
- Come on.

482
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:58,316
- All right, fine.

483
00:15:58,316 --> 00:15:59,680
But I'm gonna have to get naked.

484
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,513
- Okay.

485
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:05,204
No, you're really gonna do, (giggling)

486
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:06,852
No way.

487
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:07,853
No way.
- For the people.

488
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:08,895
- No way.

489
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:11,114
- It's all right, I got
like long johns under.

490
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:13,369
- Oh okay then dance for me, monkey.

491
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,061
Dance, dance.

492
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,061
- All right, if I do this,

493
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,112
you gotta run through pigeons.

494
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,113
- Okay but I have, I'm
gonna do it after you dance.

495
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,208
- All right, but if you don't

496
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,552
you have to give me a blowjob.

497
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,177
Yeah, that's the deal.

498
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:27,844
- Okay, I'll run through
the pigeons, Jesus.

499
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,887
Okay, dance.

500
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:38,590
Oh my god, you're such a performer.

501
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,138
(clapping)

502
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,855
Bravo, that was awesome.
- There they go.

503
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,092
Run through the pigeons.

504
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,962
- They're not there. (laughing)

505
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,086
- Give me a blowjob!

506
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:55,919
- No!

507
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:03,388
If I fell, would you catch me?

508
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,221
- No.

509
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:09,541
- Dude, you're so chill, like.

510
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,812
You and Hannah seem
like totally different.

511
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:17,208
I guess like me and my sister
are totally different too.

512
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,553
- Does Hannah still
get angry all the time?

513
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,624
- I see like her and Kane argue a lot

514
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,231
but like I don't know if
it's just 'cause I'm there

515
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,608
a lot lately.

516
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:26,829
You know what I mean, like,

517
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,149
stuff you're not supposed to see?

518
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,404
Is that something she always did?

519
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:35,081
- No it kind of started
after the accident, I mean.

520
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:36,132
- [Katherine] Your parents?

521
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,477
- It didn't affect me so
much 'cause I wasn't here

522
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:40,329
you know when the coroner said

523
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,785
everything that happened.

524
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:44,099
She tells people it was a car accident

525
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,767
but it wasn't.

526
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:46,949
It was a bit more than that.

527
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:49,782
It was, (sighing)

528
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:53,338
so they went on a hiking
trip and they got lost,

529
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,177
they got caught off and
they didn't have a beacon

530
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:58,143
or anything like that to signal anybody.

531
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,370
No cellphone reception, they got stranded,

532
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,218
like a river came in
between and cut them off.

533
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:05,746
And they were there for a long time.

534
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:08,663
And um, well they starved to death.

535
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:12,256
- You're fucking lying. (laughing)

536
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,267
You're lying.

537
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,100
- I'm not, I'm not.

538
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,351
- I thought you meant to
say they were stranded

539
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:17,687
on an island. (laughing)

540
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:18,791
- No, but really they got cut off.

541
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,313
They were skiing.

542
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:21,447
And they got cut off on a mountain.

543
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:22,882
That's how they died,
they starved to death.

544
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:23,883
- Are you serious?

545
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:24,716
- It's not a joke.

546
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,234
It's like, that's actually how they died.

547
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,777
- Wait, why does Hannah
say it's a car accident?

548
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,194
- Because when she went to view the body,

549
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,115
she was speaking to the coroner

550
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:41,551
and the coroner had cut her up, my dad up

551
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,356
and found everything inside.

552
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,489
And apparently there was like bits

553
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,786
of human flesh of my mom.

554
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:47,155
- What?!

555
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,877
- Yeah, they found little
bits of my mom in dad

556
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,841
and I understand why, I get it.

557
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,236
Because of course he wants to stay alive

558
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,310
for me and Hannah, right?

559
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,918
Like if you're starving to death

560
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,437
and you know you have two kids

561
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,083
and you're gonna be the sole provider now,

562
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,189
you would try and stay alive.

563
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:04,272
But, yeah he died anyway.

564
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,370
And a human thing that's still fucking

565
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,542
with my sister is that
I mean she can't really,

566
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,865
I don't think she can
come to terms with that

567
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,760
and she feels like it
was her fault in a way

568
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,593
'cause she was the one
that received the news.

569
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,424
(laughing)

570
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:26,524
I'm fucking with you.

571
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:27,528
It was a car accident, it's fine.

572
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,596
I was fucking (laughing)

573
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:33,051
- Oh my god, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

574
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:34,195
- It's too easy to do this to you.

575
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,899
- Dude, seriously, that's fucked up.

576
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,226
Are you fucking scared of me?

577
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,984
- I am fucking scared of you now.

578
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:40,567
- Ahaha, I'm crazy!

579
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,907
- Gullible as well.

580
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:46,740
- [Katherine] Shut up.

581
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,430
(light music)

582
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:07,677
(Kane and Hannah mumbling)

583
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,010
- What the fuck?

584
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,481
No, no, no, no, no, come on!

585
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:12,564
What the, no!

586
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,037
(screaming)

587
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:24,220

- Careful, it's really steep.

603
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,841
- I brought the wrong shoes for this.

604
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:46,534
Hannah, Hannah, Hannah.

605
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:47,856
Come, I got you a present.

606
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:51,560
But you can't tell Kane what it is.

607
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,253
Just don't eat too much,
they're pretty strong, okay?

608
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,086
- [Kane] Guys, are you coming?

609
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:57,490
- Coming, wait one second.
- Wait, one sec.

610
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,608
- Hide it.

611
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,044
- [Kane] I'm gonna see what's
around the corner, okay?

612
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,044
- Go, go go.

613
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,924
Okay, we're going, we're going.

614
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:05,257
Hannah, wait up.

615
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:09,631
(Katherine mumbling)

616
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:13,827
(crow cawing)

617
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,307
- You just spit on your bangs.

618
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:41,802
Stop!

619
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,765
Stop, stop, stop fighting, stop.

620
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,501
- We're not fighting.

621
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,334
- [Katherine] I don't like it.

622
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:51,371
- [Conner] It's just Bruv.

623
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,482
- [Hannah] Just Bruv.

624
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:53,610
Right?

625
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,110
- Oh my god, stop.

626
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,550
- [Conner] Get her, Bruv, get her.

627
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,900
Fucking get her Bruv, get her.

628
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,893
- [Hannah] Bruv compels
you, Bruv compels you,

629
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:02,627
Bruv compels you!

630
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:04,533
- Why are you all into that
stuffed animal so much,

631
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,977
that's so like, I don't know.

632
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:06,981
I think that's childish.

633
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,895
I've never been into stuffed animals.

634
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:12,454
Why are you guys so into it?

635
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:13,584
- [Hannah] It's Bruv.

636
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,001
- It's Bruv, not a stuffed animal.

637
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:16,234
- [Katherine] What's that mean?

638
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,475
- It's a Bruv, it's a brother.

639
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:20,075
- Yeah I know you guys
have had him forever

640
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:22,908
but like why, you know why that's,

641
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,316
like what is the big deal?

642
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:27,149
- Well.

643
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,356
The paramedic um,

644
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:37,075
so essentially, apparently when,

645
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,937
when I was like rolling in the air

646
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:41,771
like flipping in the air in the car

647
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:44,945
with mom and dad, Bruv, I was holding him

648
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:47,987
and apparently he must
have slipped out of my arms

649
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:52,428
and created a barrier
between me and the glass.

650
00:23:52,428 --> 00:23:54,165
Because if he hadn't I
would have been brain dead

651
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,165
like my mum.

652
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:01,400
And I think if he, I wasn't holding him,

653
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,428
feeling like my family was still with me

654
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:07,428
I'm not sure that I would
have actually made it.

655
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:18,141
He's really been there for us, he really,

656
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:22,306
you know, he was on mom's stomach, right?

657
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,497
- Right at the end.

658
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:25,821
Right at the end, still there.

659
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:29,153
- Because he saved her baby's life.

660
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:30,653
And well you know,

661
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:37,041
we pulled her off life
support and she wasn't alone.

662
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,496
(laughing)

663
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:41,874
Oh my god.

664
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,873
- [Conner] You fucking nailed that one!

665
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,858
- You did not, you didn't even budge.

666
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:46,863
I've never seen you,

667
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,672
Katherine, come on.

668
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:51,752
Hey you weren't the one who
actually had to go through it.

669
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:53,669
- [Katherine] Assholes.

670
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:55,785
- It's all right, she'll be over it.

671
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,114
(mumbling)

672
00:24:58,114 --> 00:24:59,748
- We'll get her again later.

673
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,583
- Good job, Bruv.

674
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,500
- Yeah man.

675
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,749
(birds chirping)

676
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:20,761
(bird squawking)

677
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,679
- Doesn't it like feel so good when,

678
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,683
- Dude, what are you doing?

679
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:34,646
- Someone touches your head?

680
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:39,491
But it feels different
when someone else does it.

681
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:41,201
- Where's Hannah?

682
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,235
- I don't know.

683
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,985
- Is she coming here?

684
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:46,086
How far behind you,

685
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,335
Katherine, how far behind you is she?

686
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,616
- I don't know.

687
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:51,360
- I need you to focus for a second ,okay?

688
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,517
How far behind you was she?

689
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,767
- I don't know.

690
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:02,061
You should wear your
hair down all the time.

691
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,273
- I do wear my hair down.

692
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,690
I do wear my hair down a lot.

693
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:24,247
Should I do it right here?

694
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:27,403
I thought right here
is a nice little spot.

695
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:30,239
It's a nice little spot right over there.

696
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,715
Katherine, wait.

697
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,548
Come back.

698
00:26:33,638 --> 00:26:34,471

(bird squawking)

(grunting)

709
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:44,923
- [Man] That's gotta be,

710
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,393
- [Woman] They must give
something to the tree

711
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:47,557
'cause symbiotes are always--

712
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:49,724
- [Man] You're quite tall.

713
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:54,935
Is it a big tree, Hannah?

714
00:27:54,935 --> 00:27:55,869
- Yes.

715
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:59,619
- [Man] Such, really
interested in this tree.

716
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,433

718
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,092
(bird hooting)

719
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,013
- Conner!

720
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:32,022
Conner!

721
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:40,120
- It's a strength, courage
and wisdom in life.

722
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,740
- [Katherine] Strength, courage, wisdom.

723
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,041
- [Conner] Ah, they got the
locket for me for my 18th.

724
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,640
- [Katherine] Who, your parents?

725
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,891
- [Conner] No, no, I think
Hannah chose and paid for it.

726
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,740
Maybe Mark did, for sure.

727
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,741
- [Katherine] You can polish it.

728
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:54,885
- [Conner] I broke it.

729
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:55,887
- [Katherine] Oh no.

730
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,052
- [Conner] Before I had it like fixed.

731
00:28:57,052 --> 00:28:58,531
- Hey Hannah.

732
00:28:58,531 --> 00:28:59,970
- Hey.

733
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,803
- Come.

734
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:06,305
What's wrong?

735
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:10,858
- I don't feel good.

736
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:14,518
- [Katherine] What do you need?

737
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,351
- I don't know.

738
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:18,018
(phone ringing)

739
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:23,471
Where is my, oh?

740
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:26,565
- [Michael] Hannah, hello?

741
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,398
- Hello?

742
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,374
- [Michael] Goddamit.

743
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:29,729
Susan, get me the other line.

744
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:30,733
- Hello?

745
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:32,059
- [Michael] Hey, baby how are you?

746
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:33,334
- [Hannah] I'm good, what's up?

747
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:35,503
- [Michael] You know, these
fucking casting directors,

748
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:36,974
I don't know, they wanna
see something else.

749
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:38,333
- But I thought they loved my
tape, what's wrong with it?

750
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,894
- [Michael] Everything's
good, they love you.

751
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,618
We get you on tape, no worries.

752
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:43,306
But I need it now, by tonight.

753
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:44,328
- What, tonight?

754
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:45,882
- [Michael] By tonight or now.

755
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:47,145
- Why, can they give me a day?

756
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:49,187
- [Michael] You know how these
fuckers are, I don't know.

757
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,442
I'm trying everything I can here.

758
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:52,858
- Okay, well I'm gonna be in Yosemite

759
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,489
so I don't know how much reception I have.

760
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:55,667
- [Michael] Goddamit, hold on.

761
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,759
Hey, baby can you get it to me?

762
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,411
- Okay, okay, I will.

763
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:01,652
- [Michael] Good good baby.

764
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:06,390
- I'll be able to get it
to you by eight o'clock.

765
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,397
- [Michael] That's
good, that's all I need.

766
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:08,405
- Okay.

767
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:10,168
That's all I can do.

768
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:11,215
- [Michael] Okay, eight p.m.

769
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:12,518
We're close.

770
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:13,975
- Okay, okay, thank you, thank you.

771
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:14,808
- [Michael] Yeah I gotta go.

772
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:15,641
Y'all have fun.

773
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:16,534
- You too, have a good weekend.

774
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:17,936
- [Michael] Bye, bye bye bye bye.

775
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:18,769
Susan!

776
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,311
- Where's Kane?

777
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:24,363
- Stop.

778
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:25,780
Uh, such a dweeb.

779
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,377
No, no!

780
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:29,658
Can you not?

781
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:32,142
Oh my god, oh my god!

782
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:34,960

784
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:36,815
I have to get this type away.

785
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:37,648
- So nervous right now.

786
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:38,864
- Please just focus.

787
00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:40,920
Guys, I really need to
do this audition well

788
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,540

it's like a pot thing, like a sculpture.

815
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,731
- I guess that's the sculpture.

816
00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:11,778
- [Hannah] This is the right place.

817
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,229
- I don't think there's anything in here.

818
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:15,729
Oh, this is an ashtray, gross.

819
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:22,842
- Guys, actually there's somebody here.

- [Hannah] I couldn't find
your, I read your instructions.

823
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:31,494
- [Kane] Kane and Hannah.

824
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:32,531
- You know what, you,

825
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:34,216
guys, there's other cabins here.

826
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:36,048
- [Kane] No, no, this is the one.

827
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:38,566
- No, sorry I'm renting this cabin.

828
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:41,073
- It says that we have it
for the next two nights, so.

829
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:45,740
- Oh okay, no, I have this
for the next two months.

832
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:06,980
- So what do you do with yourself?

833
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,730
- Um, well I mean I started
this app about five years ago

834
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:15,179
and it went gangbusters
like on my first year

835
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,223
which was awesome and allowed me

836
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:20,223
to support myself, travel the world.

837
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,862
I don't have to work so I
decided after a couple years

838
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:26,565
that I just wanted to come back

839
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,286
and just work on a couple things

840
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:30,296
that I really always wanted
to do since I was a kid

841
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,610
which was write a children's book.

842
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,945
You know, kids in a fantasy
land, exploring in the forest

843
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:38,112
so it's been really cool, I'm excited.

844
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:41,091
- How old are you, if
you don't mind me asking?

845
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:44,341
- I just turned 25 a couple months ago.

846
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,547
- [Woman] So this is the other house,

847
00:33:50,547 --> 00:33:52,645
I'm sure you guys gonna love it.

848
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:54,301
- Guys.
- It's a lot more spacious.

849
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:56,244
- We need to shoot the
self tape right now.

850
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,638
Like no, no I'll turn this in.

851
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,138
- Whoah.
- Welcome.

852
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:01,369
Welcome.

853
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:04,383
- Dude, there's space for so much beer.

854
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:05,925
- [Kane] Come, let's set up the,

855
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:07,369
she's showing us the place first.

856
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:08,599
- No.
- Come.

857
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,650
- You go.

858
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,327
- Yeah, you get a lot of space here.

859
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,019
- [Kane] This is a solid bedframe.

860
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,129
All right Hannah.

861
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:18,059
Hannah, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

862
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,302
Who's taking my room,
who's taking my room?

863
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:22,043
- [Woman] The master bedroom.

864
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,976
- [Hannah] This is my career.

865
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:25,382
- [Woman] Is she okay?

866
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:27,432
- You can wait and we'll film it

867
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,449
and when we finish, we'll
come and have a drink and,

868
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,447
- Okay.

869
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:31,280
- You wanna help us?

870
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,719
- Yes, but I don't know what I'm gonna do.

871
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,807
I'm not an actress, I've never been--

872
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,848
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- I don't mean to impose.

873
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:38,623
- No, no, no, it's okay, I'll help you.

874
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,594
It's just, you just gotta
tell me what I need to do.

875
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:43,250
- Guys, please, please!
- Okay, okay.

876
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,293
- Is she okay?

877
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,126
- [Kane] Okay, roll it.

878
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:45,959
- Yep.

879
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,792
- Rolling.

880
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,875
- Hey, I'm Hannah Barlow
and I'm five foot 10.

881
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,236
- [Kane] Just do it again,
the towels are in the way.

882
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:52,069
Okay, you ready?

883
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,902
- Yup.

884
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:55,957
- [Kane] Okay great, hang on.

885
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:56,790
Go more.

886
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,623
- [Hannah] Okay.

887
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:58,456
- [Kane] Hug the wall!

888
00:34:58,456 --> 00:34:59,338
- [Hannah] I am hugging the wall.

889
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:01,253
- [Kane] Action.

890
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:02,954
- What's wrong?

891
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:03,955
- [Katherine] Nothing.

892
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:06,205
(laughing)

893
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:07,908
- [Kane] Hang on.

894
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:08,741
- You're good, you're good, you're good.

895
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:09,574
- No, no, it's,
- We're good?

896
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,437
- [Kane] Put it back up, put it back up.

897
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:11,687
- Guys, please.

898
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,389
(laughing)

899
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:15,797
- [Kane] Hannah, hug the wall!

900
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,584
- (sighing) Why are you doing this?

901
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:18,673
- [Katherine] Doing what?

902
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:19,960
- Whenever we go out as a group

903
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,973
you always sit here by
yourself looking like

904
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,572
you wanna slit your wrists.

905
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:25,732
Just like, shake it up, come
and get a dance with me.

906
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:26,757
- [Katherine] No.

907
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,400
- So then go home.

908
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,497
- [Katherine] I don't want to.

909
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:30,689
- So what do you want?

910
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:31,724
Because I'm sick of
explaining to everybody

911
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:33,691
why you're being such
a downer all the time.

912
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:35,039
And I'm not gonna invite you out anymore.

913
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,894
- Okay, I like sitting here.

914
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:39,099
I like watching my generation live.

915
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:42,728
I don't wanna forget my
life as it happens to me.

916
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:44,220
I wanna witness it.

917
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,524
I wanna know how and why it happens

918
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,512
so that when I'm chained
to a recliner one day

919
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:51,129
with saliva pouring
from my toothless mouth

920
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:54,189
and shitting myself, I can
smile as the rapid fire

921
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:56,504
burns through my brain.

922
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:58,254
Because I understand.

923
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,568
- This is my jam.

924
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:05,901
- Just go dance.

925
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,751
- [Kane] Cut.

926
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,274
- Okay, cool.

927
00:36:12,274 --> 00:36:13,734
- [Kane] Katherine, that was really good.

928
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,378
- Okay, come on.

929
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:16,892
We got it.

930
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:20,652
- Dude we could shoot your self tape.

931
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:21,807
- Guys, come on.

932
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:24,640
(energetic music)

933
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:34,597
♪ Save our souls ♪

934
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:36,491
- Hey Hannah, do you have
any signal on your phone?

935
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,366
- Yeah.

936
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:38,199
- You do?

937
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,032
- Yeah.

938
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:39,865
- [Kane] Hannah?

939
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:40,698
- [Hannah] Yes?

940
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,730
- [Kane] Should I do the
sauce in a separate pan?

941
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,861
Or should I just pack it?

942
00:36:42,861 --> 00:36:43,694
- No.
- No?

943
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:44,527
- [Hannah] Kane, figure it out.

944
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:45,360
My person is exhausted.

945
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,193
- It's one and up.

946
00:36:46,193 --> 00:36:47,260
One on two.

947
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,448
- [Hannah] Figure it
out, go cook and get him.

948
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:50,532
Katherine, what are you?

949
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:51,704
Just use my phone.

950
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:54,020
- I can't use your phone
'cause I'm trying to see

951
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,741
if I got a text message so
I have to check my phone.

952
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:59,384
- [Hannah] Can you just text
the person from my phone?

953
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,385
- Dude, where's the light?

954
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,788
- No, 'cause I want to
see if they wrote back.

955
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,831
- [Hannah] Okay.

956
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,060
- I don't think you understand
I need cellphone signal.

957
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,227
I got no wifi.

958
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,535
I just like, it's my iMessage.

959
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:12,901
- I'll manage, thank you.

960
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:13,734
- That person doesn't have an iphone

961
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,856
so he'll send me regular text message.

962
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:19,052
Does no one care?

963
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:24,006
Honestly I keep searching
for signal, thanks guys.

964
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:24,839
- Oh.

965
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:25,672
(roaring)

966
00:37:25,672 --> 00:37:26,889
Honey bear!

967
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,115
Here you go, honey bear.

968
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:28,948
Ah, yum.

969
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:33,131
What honey bear.

970
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:36,510
Bye. (laughing)

971
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,250
Whoah dude, look at how
many of these you've done.

972
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,102
Is this the schedule that I created?

973
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:42,225
- No, no.

974
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:44,047
No, Hannah no!

975
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:44,880
- No, hey, give me a sec.

976
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,700
- Whoah, don't spoil the
weed, don't spoil the weed.

977
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,407
- This is not meant to be
used for cutting up weed.

978
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:53,408
- I don't care.

979
00:37:53,408 --> 00:37:54,422
I have it.

980
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:56,095
I was looking at it

981
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:57,921
while I rolled the weed.

982
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,483
- Put this in your bag where it belongs.

983
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:03,400
I don't wanna see this
anywhere but here, okay?

984
00:38:13,764 --> 00:38:14,597
- Ugh!

985
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,228
Fucking awesome, great.

986
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:21,898
- What, are you okay?

987
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:22,731
- Hayaaah.

988
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,957
- [Hannah] Hey, what's up?

989
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,632
- Um, so the place that I was gonna get

990
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,631
just fell through.

991
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:31,900
- [Hannah] What?

992
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,781
- They like made it seem like the landlord

993
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,892
like wouldn't run a
credit check and she did

994
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:40,935
and 'cause of all my student
loans I didn't get approved, so

995
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:42,455
now I have to find another place.

996
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:44,538
- [Hannah] Dude, I'm so sorry.

997
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:46,159
I'm so sorry.

998
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,108
- The Kane Hannah
Katherine show continues.

999
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,108
- Yeah.

1000
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:50,884
You know you can stay with us, right?

1001
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,065
- [Katherine] No.

1002
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:54,476
Let me get by though.
- No go.

1003
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:55,838
No, it's cool.

1004
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:57,650
- Katherine, of course you
can keep staying with us.

1005
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,781
It's more than fine.

1006
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,059
- No, I've been there too long

1007
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,358
and I've gotta find somewhere.

1008
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:04,804
I can probably crash with Christina

1009
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:06,089
for a while or something.

1010
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,487
- [Kane] Has she got a one bedroom too?

1011
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:10,247
- [Katherine] No, she lives
with two other roommates.

1012
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,722
- Well, maybe it's more room, I dunno.

1013
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:16,472
But you're welcome to
stay with us, I'm just,

1014
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,580
- [Katherine] Cheers.

1015
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,413
- Cheers!

1016
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:22,766
- [Conner] Yeah, cheers.

1017
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:23,765
- So what are we cheering to?

1018
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:24,762
Wait, wait wait.

1019
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,479
Whoah, eyes, eyeballs, eye balls.

1020
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:28,095
What are we cheesing to.

1021
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:31,166
- Uh, Conner moving to America!

1022
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,562
- Conner going to San
Francisco Ballet Company!

1023
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:34,507
- Katherine finding an apartment.

1024
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:36,638
- That's more prescient.

1025
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:40,555
Cheers, cheers, cheers,
cheers, cheers, cheers.

1026
00:39:42,804 --> 00:39:44,940
- So is that why you were
looking for the reception?

1027
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,032
- [Katherine] Yes and no.

1028
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,872
- [Hannah] What do you mean?

1029
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:52,738
- I was trying to see
if Guy had rang back.

1030
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:55,448
- [Hanna] Rang back to what?

1031
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:57,383
- To a text I sent.

1032
00:39:57,383 --> 00:39:59,059
- [Hannah] Oh.

1033
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:00,620
- It was a one night thing, right?

1034
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,664
- Can we not?

1035
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,806
Like can we not?

1036
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:05,410
- [Kane] Then we drop to
the theater and it's like

1037
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,860
she's sitting in the row behind him

1038
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,868
and I've seen the guy before,
I know what he looks like.

1039
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:10,980
- [Conner] Did you prebook the tickets?

1040
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,813
- [Hannah] Yes!

1041
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:12,646
- [Kane] So I like sit down.

1042
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:14,341
- [Hannah] Yes, she prebooked our tickets.

1043
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:15,599
She bought them for us.

1044
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,636
She convinced us to go with her.

1045
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:18,831
- I feel like the dick.

1046
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:20,520
I felt like a dick for saying this

1047
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,377
but like maybe he's
just not that into you.

1048
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:23,724
It's like,

1049
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,726
- [Hannah] Kane, don't.

1050
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:25,724
- They made a movie about it.

1051
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:29,010
And it's, maybe he's
just not that into you.

1052
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,010
But, in Katherine's defense.
- Are you gonna keep going?

1053
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:36,203
- So difficult, Kane.

1054
00:40:36,203 --> 00:40:37,361
That's just what you do.

1055
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:39,140
- What do you mean?

1056
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,480
Dude, I'm trying to, I'm being,

1057
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,481
I'm trying to be a friend.

1058
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,479
- [Katherine] You're trying to what, Kane?

1059
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,484
- I'm trying to be a friend.

1060
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,861
- You're trying to make fun of me

1061
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,061
in front of other people,

1062
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,063
that's what you're doing right now.

1063
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:49,477
- No, I mean, these are our people.

1064
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:50,966
Am I, in front of Hannah?

1065
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:52,466
Conner, all right.

1066
00:40:53,405 --> 00:40:55,268
I know you don't know, but--

1067
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:56,883
- You have such a fucking
smirk on your face right now,

1068
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:58,751
don't even, 'cause you know
exactly what you're doing.

1069
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:01,561
- I'm just like trying to be,

1070
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,094
like no one else will say this to you

1071
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,535
but I'm trying to help you as a,

1072
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:05,781
I promise you.

1073
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:07,451
I promise you, okay look, I promise you.

1074
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,804
I promise you, I promise you.

1075
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:12,027
Look, Katherine, I'm serious.

1076
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:13,858
- No one else will tell
you this, Katherine.

1077
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:16,010
But I'm such a good friend
that I'm gonna tell you

1078
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,700
'cause I'm so great.

1079
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,952
I'm such a great fucking person.

1080
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:20,975
- Okay that sounded like a dick.

1081
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:21,961
- And I'm so fucking great.

1082
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:23,801
Oh my god, Kane!

1083
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,473
Oh my god, you're the
best friend I've ever had!

1084
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:28,254
Nobody's ever been so honest with me.

1085
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:29,841
Thank you so much, Kane.

1086
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,341
Thank you so much.

1087
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:34,921
I'm so, I'm like beaming with happiness

1088
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:36,532
because I cannot believe
I have such a great

1089
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:38,699
fucking friend in my life.

1090
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,431
- What are you laughing
about, you agree with me.

1091
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:46,872
- Because it's fucking
hilarious, it was funny, okay?

1092
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,417
It was funny, like what
I just did right now

1093
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,426
was fucking funny.

1094
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,761
- I don't want any, I'm
not trying to fight.

1095
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:51,878
Why are you turning this into a fight?

1096
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:53,471
- No one has ever said this to me before.

1097
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:54,933
- When can we talk normally?

1098
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:55,939
- And then I'm like,

1099
00:41:55,939 --> 00:41:56,772
- When are you gonna listen to me?

1100
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:59,250
- Wait, he had said this
to me a thousand times

1101
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,446
and why do I keep--

1102
00:42:00,446 --> 00:42:02,368
- Fucking hell, Katherine, listen to me.

1103
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:03,822
All right, I'm your fucking friend.

1104
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,968
- Okay, and you've said
it to me a thousand times.

1105
00:42:05,968 --> 00:42:07,650
Why do you have to fucking
repeat it all the time

1106
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,871
in front of everyone?

1107
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,131
If you were a real friend, you'd
have a conversation with me

1108
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:13,592
when there's not a
fucking audience around.

1109
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:15,171
- This is not an
audience, it's our family!

1110
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,382
- [Hannah] Calm down.

1111
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:17,843
- What, Conner's here, her brother.

1112
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:20,510
It's your best friend's brother.

1113
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:23,094
I didn't, what.

1114
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:24,094
Like what are you trying,

1115
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:25,736
you trying to impress him too?

1116
00:42:25,736 --> 00:42:26,569
- Kane.

1117
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:27,853
- Are you trying to win him over

1118
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,055
and make him fall in love with you?

1119
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:32,812
- Oh, man, you're just like grabbing the,

1120
00:42:32,812 --> 00:42:34,845
you're just fucking making the hole

1121
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,175
so much bigger right now.

1122
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:37,256
- You're clearly not
self-aware enough to talk.

1123
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:38,392
You're clearly not self-aware enough

1124
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,464
to talk about this.

1125
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:40,297
- [Katherine] Keep
going, let's see how deep

1126
00:42:40,297 --> 00:42:41,243
this fucking hole can get.

1127
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:42,122
- What are you gonna
do, stab me with a fork?

1128
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:43,044
- No.

1129
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,158
I'm just like.

1130
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:48,158
- [Kane] Why don't you
just, why don't you just?

1131
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,432
- [Announcer] Now unfortunately
when these also exploded,

1132
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:58,166
you should be looking at a
small clearing in the bush

1133
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,259
right on the edge of the lake.

1134
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:03,778
That is where the channel
used to run through.

1135
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:06,257
- [Katherine] You
seriously have, like hello,

1136
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:07,680
join the party.

1137
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,395
Another one?

1138
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,392
Oh.

1139
00:43:10,392 --> 00:43:11,392
- [Conner] Yeah, scorpions have six legs.

1140
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:12,397
- [Katherine] Yeah they have six legs.

1141
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:13,581
You're putting in eight.

1142
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:15,763
(Conner speaking in foreign language)

1143
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,908
- [Conner] Harry Potter.

1144
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:19,902
- [Katherine] Wait, do you
really like Harry Potter?

1145
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:21,819
- [Conner] Yeah I really love, yeah, yeah.

1146
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:24,702
Number four, I fucking love
number four. (mumbling)

1147
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,996
- [Katherine] Oh dude, Goblet of Fire?

1148
00:43:25,996 --> 00:43:27,044
- [Conner] Yeah, Goblet of fire.

1149
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:28,043
- [Katherine] Oh my god, okay.

1150
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:30,261
So I read, I read the first three books

1151
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:33,052
as they came out when I was like 11, 12.

1152
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:36,219
And then, on the fourth one I stopped.

1153
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,481
Like, hey.

1154
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:41,833
- Hey, want some?

1155
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:42,939
- No, no, no.

1156
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:43,772
No.

1157
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:45,880
- Okay.

1158
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:49,916
- What was I talking about, oh.

1159
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,166
(bubbling)

1160
00:43:56,207 --> 00:43:57,253
- Okay, no.

1161
00:43:57,253 --> 00:43:58,253
- [Both] No.

1162
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:02,789
- What are you doing?

1163
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:03,954
Hannah, stop.

1164
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:04,787
- Wait.

1165
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:06,712
What?

1166
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:14,759
- I think your brother's really cute.

1167
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:15,592
- I know.

1168
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:17,562
- How do you know?

1169
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:20,081
- 'Cause I think he's cute.

1170
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,836
- Yeah he's, he's like duh he's cute.

1171
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:24,319
- Yeah.

1172
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,322
Yeah.

1173
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:26,763
- And so I'm gonna wake up one day

1174
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:28,191
and I'm gonna be 70 years old

1175
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:30,934
and I'm gonna roll over
and no one's gonna be there

1176
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,980
because when I have these romances,

1177
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,121
these relationships
that never went anywhere

1178
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:37,810
because I took my career over them.

1179
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,200
And you know, you turn around, you're like

1180
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,035
well at least I've dedicated to an art.

1181
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:42,793
Like okay, say I make 10 movies.

1182
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:44,425
What if no one sees them?

1183
00:44:44,425 --> 00:44:47,088
- My artform is dead for me when I'm 34.

1184
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,270
It's gone.

1185
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,717
Like that's it, over.

1186
00:44:50,717 --> 00:44:53,680
You're, there is a point
when you get into your,

1187
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,844
above your 30s where you're like

1188
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:56,714
any moment this could stop.

1189
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:59,169
Any moment, I'm kind of looking for a job

1190
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:01,345
and I have no other source of employment

1191
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:02,794
other than my ballet career.

1192
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:06,762
So like, you can make
films till you're 80s.

1193
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:09,262
I can make ballet till I'm 34.

1194
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:14,195
Stop being a whiny little bitch.

1195
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:17,904
- Did I mess up?

1196
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:19,321
- No, no, no, no.

1197
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,777
- Okay let's just move on.

1198
00:45:22,777 --> 00:45:23,776
- Okay.

1199
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:24,782
Just forget I said it.

1200
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:25,781
- Okay.

1201
00:45:25,781 --> 00:45:26,614
- It wasn't meant to
be a whole discussion.

1202
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:27,667
- No, no, no.

1203
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:28,671
- Okay.

1204
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:29,504
- Um.

1205
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,185
- Are you gonna take more?

1206
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,180
Okay I definitely cannot keep up with you.

1207
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,013
(Kane groaning)

1208
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:46,379
Oh this fire is like really hot.

1209
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:49,796
- Guys this weed is seriously kicking in.

1210
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:51,640
Ooh!

1211
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:53,798
South Africa.

1212
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:57,236
- I think we're going
to win the World Cup.

1213
00:45:57,236 --> 00:45:59,499
And the husband who's upstairs
and she's cheating on you,

1214
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:01,616
he comes downstairs and
he takes the breakfast,

1215
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:02,996
he doesn't say his thank you

1216
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,426
and he fucks off to the pub.

1217
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:07,185
All different kinds of Scottish.

1218
00:46:07,185 --> 00:46:09,399
So I don't know which
blends I'm doing right now

1219
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,469
but it's somewhere,
somewhere in the country.

1220
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:12,471
- [Katherine] It's so good.

1221
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,075
- Thank you. (giggling)

1222
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,298
Oh my god!
- Shut up.

1223
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:17,373
- No, shut your fucking face up.

1224
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:19,177
- No you shut

1225
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:20,276
your fucking face.
- You need to close your legs

1226
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:21,587
for like just like a second.

1227
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:24,207
- Just like talk for a second
like can I just tell you?

1228
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:25,464
- I know you're sleeping
with Justin next door

1229
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:28,309
and you just need to like
close your legs and stop.

1230
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:29,559
Like just stop.

1231
00:46:32,328 --> 00:46:36,661
- When somebody dies, their
voice is the first thing

1232
00:46:37,758 --> 00:46:39,091
that you forget.

1233
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:42,636
We're all on Facebook and there are photos

1234
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,843
of us there forever.

1235
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,505
And yet if I wanted to look up your voice,

1236
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,417
I might not be able to find it

1237
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,731
unless you posted videos on Facebook.

1238
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:52,998
But not everyone does audio recordings

1239
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:54,318
and so it's like.

1240
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,284
- Not people from like
our parents' generationn.

1241
00:46:57,284 --> 00:46:58,204
- [Kane] Yeah.

1242
00:46:58,204 --> 00:47:00,205
- But it's crazy because
if your parents died

1243
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:02,255
and then you never use Facebook that much

1244
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:03,689
then you wouldn't remember their voice.

1245
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:05,120
- It's not even like a,

1246
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,717
- Hey, do we have any voice
recordings of mom and dad?

1247
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:12,021
- [Conner] I can't remember any.

1248
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:13,919
- I don't think I have.

1249
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,573
So I'm gonna forget what they sound like.

1250
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:19,076
- Do you still remember
what they sound like?

1251
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:19,978
- Did you ever put up,

1252
00:47:19,978 --> 00:47:22,787
'cause I they never put
my grandmother on tape

1253
00:47:22,787 --> 00:47:25,642
and I always had these
long discussions with her.

1254
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,484
- Me neither, oh my god, you're so right.

1255
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:30,463
- I don't remember what
mom and dad sound like.

1256
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:31,296
Do you?

1257
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,702
- [Conner] I honest, I
remember dad, to be honest.

1258
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:37,952
I remember dad.

1259
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,089
- This weed is seriously kicking in.

1260
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:45,763
It's starting to do that womp womp thing.

1261
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:46,942
- What?

1262
00:47:46,942 --> 00:47:48,242
- Where it's like I'm zooming in

1263
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:52,305
but the ring around the
circle that I'm seeing

1264
00:47:52,305 --> 00:47:53,753
is zooming out.

1265
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:54,895
And it's,

1266
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:55,728
- What?

1267
00:47:57,303 --> 00:47:59,053
(exhaling)

1268
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:00,568
- No, no, no, no, no.

1269
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:01,607
- I can't even swallow this.

1270
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,634
- Guys, he's not, he's actually gonna be.

1271
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:05,371
- Fuck, I'm gonna vomit again.

1272
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:06,372
I know I'm gonna vomit again.

1273
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:07,776
- No, no ,no, no, Kane.

1274
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:09,338
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

1275
00:48:09,338 --> 00:48:10,567
- No, I'm good.

1276
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:12,817
(retching)

1277
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,008
- No, you're gonna make him go,

1278
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:16,841
I can just go back and do my part.

1279
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:17,839
- Conner, stop.

1280
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,589
(dramatic music)

1281
00:48:29,258 --> 00:48:33,983
- Um, I feel like you've
been flirting with me.

1282
00:48:33,983 --> 00:48:35,928
- I feel like you've
been flirting with me.

1283
00:48:35,928 --> 00:48:36,929
- What?

1284
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:38,151
- Yeah.

1285
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,017
- What do you mean?

1286
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,437
- You know what I mean.

1287
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:42,434
- No.

1288
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:43,436
- Yeah.

1289
00:48:43,436 --> 00:48:44,434
- I don't.

1290
00:48:44,434 --> 00:48:45,619
- So we haven't been flirting for parts.

1291
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,384
- I don't know, I don't
know if we have or not.

1292
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:48,504
- I think we have.

1293
00:48:48,504 --> 00:48:50,101
I have been.

1294
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:51,601
But have you been?

1295
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:53,406
I think so.

1296
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:57,085
- Are we trying to be that subtle

1297
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:59,535
that we don't even know
if the other is flirting?

1298
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:00,811
- Yeah, pretty much.

1299
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:03,011
- That's how subtle we've been for like,

1300
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:04,773
no, that's it.

1301
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:05,776
(laughing)

1302
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,937
- So?

1303
00:49:06,937 --> 00:49:07,941
- Huh?

1304
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:08,940
- So?

1305
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,941
- So what?

1306
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:12,774
- Exactly, what do we do about it?

1307
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:39,342
(moaning)

1308
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:51,658
- [Conner] (groaning) oh shit, oh shit.

1309
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,873
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1310
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:54,881
The condoms.

1311
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,189
I don't have the condoms on.

1312
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,272
- [Katherine] What, what?

1313
00:50:00,312 --> 00:50:02,472
- [Conner] Just wait, I don't
have the fucking condoms on.

1314
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:03,474
- [Katherine] What?

1315
00:50:03,474 --> 00:50:04,307
- [Conner] That's about yeah, just wait.

1316
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:05,277
- [Katherine] No, no, no, no.

1317
00:50:05,277 --> 00:50:06,110
- [Conner] Just let me get it.

1318
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:06,943
Just wait, wait, wait.

1319
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:07,776
One sec.

1320
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:09,932
- [Katherine] Ay, no,
no, no I just wanna be--

1321
00:50:09,932 --> 00:50:14,227
- [Conner] Oh that's got
it, wait, wait, wait.

1322
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:16,338
- Oh god.
- Shit, there.

1323
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:18,012
I think I got it on a bit.

1324
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:19,012
Good, there.

1325
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:21,629
- What the fuck?

1326
00:50:21,629 --> 00:50:22,462
- I'm sorry.

1327
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:23,295
- What the fuck?

1328
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:24,128
- I'm sorry.

1329
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:24,961
- What the fuck?
- No, I'm sorry.

1330
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:26,040
No, don't get angry.
- Did you not know?

1331
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,873
- Don't get angry, don't get angry.

1332
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:27,840
- Did you not know?
- No, it's fine, it's fine.

1333
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,082
- How did you not feel that happening?

1334
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:30,332
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1335
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:35,185
- It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

1336
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:36,468
Hey come on, come on, come on.

1337
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:37,979
Why are you panicking,
why are you panicking?

1338
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:39,534
- Because now, oh my god.

1339
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,718
Now we have to get, no, oh fuck.

1340
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:42,717
- We just go in there.

1341
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:43,823
- I am not on the pill
and now I have to go

1342
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,490
get Plan B and we're in the
middle of fucking nowhere.

1343
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,863
- Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

1344
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:48,696
Fine.

1345
00:50:50,706 --> 00:50:52,637
(thudding) Ah, fuck, fuck.

1346
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:54,387
Oh, it fucking burns.

1347
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:57,185
Oh, it fucking burns.

1348
00:50:58,103 --> 00:51:01,661
(Hannah sobbing)

1349
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:02,494
- Babe?

1350
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:04,541
Shh, shh.

1351
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,920
Hey, it's just a dream, it's just a dream.

1352
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:17,260
Come here.

1353
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,442
It's just a dream, just a dream.

1354
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:21,826
It's just a dream.

1355
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:23,229
You're okay, you're okay.

1356
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:25,142
It's just a dream, come on.

1357
00:51:25,142 --> 00:51:25,975
Shh.

1358
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:30,904
It's just a dream, okay?

1359
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:32,694
- Yeah.

1360
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:37,134
- You're okay, you're okay.

1361
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,215
I love you.

1362
00:51:42,406 --> 00:51:43,649
It's okay, it's okay.

1363
00:51:43,649 --> 00:51:45,066
- I love you too.

1364
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,086
- [Kane] You're my best friend.

1365
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:52,588
- [Hannah] Oh, you're my best friend.

1366
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:53,722
Yeah.

1367
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:55,607
Are you still feeling shit?

1368
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:56,605
- [Kane] No, I'm okay, I'll be fine.

1369
00:51:56,605 --> 00:51:57,438
- [Hannah] What time is it?

1370
00:51:57,438 --> 00:51:59,140
- [Kane] I don't know,
don't worry about it.

1371
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,377
- [Hannah] Okay.

1372
00:52:00,377 --> 00:52:01,600
- [Kane] Shh, shh.

1373
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,600
(chaotic rap music)

1374
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:24,798
(humming)

1375
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:27,844
- [Kane] Pancakes in the morning!

1376
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,895
- Pancakes to the morning!

1377
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:31,109
Okay you die now.

1378
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,467
Okay you die now.

1379
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:33,946
- [Kane] You die now.

1380
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:36,061
- Look, I'm a person of faith.

1381
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:38,182
I'm a person of faith.

1382

- [Kane] Is there no other
way to get down this path?

1388
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:48,837
- [Hannah] We gotta go through it!

1389
00:52:48,837 --> 00:52:50,366
- [Kane] It's like slippery, look.

1390
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:53,366
- [Hannah] Oh, Kane's lost
his balls again everybody.

1391
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:55,975
Everybody I'd just like to
make a service announcement.

1392
00:52:55,975 --> 00:52:57,161
- Dude, it's nice, I'm dry.

1393
00:52:57,161 --> 00:52:58,160
I'm not complaining about it.

1394
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
- I'd like to let you know

1395
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,220
that one of our passengers,
Kane Dennis has lost his balls.

1396
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,239
- Fuck off.

1397
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:04,463
- He dropped them somewhere
here in the woods.

1398
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:05,717
- Whatever.

1399
00:53:05,717 --> 00:53:06,860
- They're very salty.

1400
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,456
They're very pubey.

1401
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:10,926
- [Katherine] Yeah, just make
sure that it's covered, okay?

1402
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,730
Put your jeans over your boot or whatever,

1403
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,196
just she cannot find out.

1404
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:15,363
Like, oh fuck.

1405
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:18,269
- [Hannah] Let's just
forget our hopes and dreams

1406
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:19,576
and live in the woods.

1407
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:21,186
Wouldn't that be good?

1408
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:22,603
Ah, love it here.

1409
00:53:25,174 --> 00:53:26,007
- Hey, um.

1410
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:30,139
Can you stay right here?

1411
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:30,972
- Yes.

1412
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:31,805
- Right here.

1413
00:53:31,805 --> 00:53:32,638
- Yeah.

1414
00:53:32,638 --> 00:53:33,471
- I'm gonna get back and get the 5d

1415
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:35,177
and come back and get a video of you.

1416
00:53:35,177 --> 00:53:36,194
- Okay.

1417
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:37,715
- Don't like wander off
and start taking photos.

1418
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,237
Like right here, I don't
wanna forget this spot, okay?

1419
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:41,957
Stay there, stay there.

1420
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:42,790
Love you.

1421
00:53:43,702 --> 00:53:45,714
Be back in a minute.

1422
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:46,547
- Okay.

1423
00:54:10,073 --> 00:54:11,801
- [Katherine] Shit, is that Hannah?

1424
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,496
Oh fuck, what are we gonna tell her?

1425
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:15,359
No, we were supposed to be
here like two hours ago.

1426
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,346
Oh my god, she's gonna kill us.

1427
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:19,505
Hey!

1428
00:54:19,505 --> 00:54:20,338
Dammit.

1429
00:54:23,321 --> 00:54:24,154
- [Conner] We went to see the sunrise.

1430
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:25,450
- [Katherine] Yes, yes.

1431
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,909
(drowned out by gravel grinding)

1432
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:29,914
Yeah, in Bartlett.

1433
00:54:29,914 --> 00:54:30,747
- [Conner] Right in the middle.

1434
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:31,704
- [Katherine] And that's
why it took us this long

1435
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:32,903
to get back, okay.

1436
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:34,570
We'll just say that.

1437
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:39,466
- [Hannah] Hey.

1438
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:40,468
- Hey.

1439
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:41,488
- Where have you guys been?

1440
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:43,963
- We went and looked at the
sunrise in Yosemite valley.

1441
00:54:43,963 --> 00:54:44,964
- [Hannah] What?

1442
00:54:44,964 --> 00:54:47,049
- Yeah, we left like,
early early like four.

1443
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:48,646
Otherwise we would have
woke you up to come.

1444
00:54:48,646 --> 00:54:49,479
- Yeah.

1445
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:50,312
- [Hannah] What?

1446
00:54:50,312 --> 00:54:51,145
- Yeah.

1447
00:54:51,145 --> 00:54:52,012
- [Hannah] So while I was
taking care of Kane throwing up

1448
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:53,670
in the bathroom, you were
watching the sun rise?

1449
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,389
- [Conner] You know, we didn't
really just want to like

1450
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:56,311
crowd around you while he was--

1451
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,390
- Yeah we asked you if you
need, we thought it was fine.

1452
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,136
- No, dude, that's fine, that's fine.

1453
00:55:00,136 --> 00:55:03,034
We actually, we're late, so.

1454
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:04,550
- Hey, what's up, guys?

1455
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,604
- [Conner] Hey man, how you feeling?

1456
00:55:05,604 --> 00:55:07,632
- [Kane] Ah, yeah.

1457
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:08,630
- [Conner] Yeah?

1458
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,792
- We've gotta go.

1459
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:11,073
We're already an hour late.

1460
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:12,220
- You said you were gonna wait for me.

1461
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,220
- Yeah, I know but you took so long.

1462
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:18,531
- Yeah but I said wait
and I was gonna come down.

1463
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:19,364
- Oh.

1464
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:21,741
I'm just gonna grab my bag.

1465
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:23,678
Do you want your bag?

1466
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:24,676
- Are we going back there?

1467
00:55:24,676 --> 00:55:25,907
- [Hannah] No we're going to the ice rink.

1468
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:26,907
- Now?

1469
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:27,740
- [Hannah] Yeah.

1470
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,429
Dude, we're an hour behind.

1471
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,813
- Dude I didn't know that plan.

1472
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:33,396
No one told me about that plan.

1473
00:55:37,066 --> 00:55:38,210
So what time are we getting up again?

1474
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,211
- [Hannah] Six a.m.

1475
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,942
- [Kane] Six a.m., what
time is your audition?

1476
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:41,941
- [Hannah] Two.

1477
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:43,164
- [Kane] That's not enough
time to get to San Francisco.

1478
00:55:43,164 --> 00:55:44,167
- Kane, Kane!

1479
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,000
Look out the window.

1480
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,993
It's like, it's so pretty.

1481
00:55:46,993 --> 00:55:50,076
(light guitar music)

1482
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:55,624
Guys.

1483
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,308
That was the Polaroid camera.

1484
00:56:05,308 --> 00:56:06,892
- She fucking pissed me off last night.

1485
00:56:06,892 --> 00:56:08,070
- I know, she pissed me off too.

1486
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,331
- And you hadn't put her in her place

1487
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:10,334
or said anything about it.

1488
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,991
- But Kane, she's emotionally irrational.

1489
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:14,443
I don't know what to say.

1490
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:16,613
This is fantastic, this is amazing.

1491
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:18,004
- Really annoying because it gets me like

1492
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:19,541
it's this burning feeling in here

1493
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,205
and it feels like I've
just swallowed hot water.

1494
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:22,480
- Kane, go and see a therapist.

1495
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,369
- I'm sitting there like this.
- I am not your therapist.

1496
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:27,100
- And it's like I just wanna
- I am not your therapist!

1497
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,154
- Fucking lash out at them.

1498
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:28,987
- Go talk to someone else, this is my--

1499
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,449
- I wanna like grab her
head while she's driving

1500
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,032
and just bang it against
the back of the seat

1501
00:56:32,032 --> 00:56:33,263
and the window.

1502
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:34,285
- Stop it.

1503
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:35,328
- And then I get arrested because

1504
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:36,370
that's like female abuse.

1505
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,324
No but wait, wait, wait.

1506
00:56:37,324 --> 00:56:38,506
- [Hannah] What?

1507
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:39,913
- [Kane] Babe, babe, babe.

1508
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:42,830
(light rock music)

1509
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:49,864
- [Katherine] Come on, you can do it.

1510
00:56:51,156 --> 00:56:52,156
- Is it gonna twist my ankles?

1511
00:56:52,156 --> 00:56:53,191
- No you're fine.

1512
00:56:53,191 --> 00:56:54,391
- Okay, pass my gloves
'cause I can film this

1513
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:55,396
all going down.

1514
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:56,658
It's gonna happen.

1515
00:56:56,658 --> 00:56:57,743
- [Katherine] I just
wanna stay by the fire.

1516
00:56:57,743 --> 00:56:58,944
I don't wanna go on the ice.

1517
00:56:58,944 --> 00:56:59,948
- [Hannah] You don't what what?

1518
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:00,947
- Why not?

1519
00:57:00,947 --> 00:57:02,544
- 'Cause I don't know how to ice skate.

1520
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,699
- Neither do I.

1521
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:05,695
- Oh yeah I'm totally not ice skating.

1522
00:57:05,695 --> 00:57:06,988
- Dude why aren't you ice skating?

1523
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:08,994
- No man, I'm so hung over, fuck it.

1524
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:10,073
- We didn't drink that much.

1525
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:11,074
- From last night?

1526
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:12,077
- I thought you were smoking all night.

1527
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:14,174
- No, he did drink and
smoke a lot last night.

1528
00:57:14,174 --> 00:57:15,424
He did, he did.

1529
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,150
- Dude, what would you do
if I pushed you right now?

1530
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,805
Would that be like malicious?

1531
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,722
Would that be like not even a joke?

1532
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,481
You all right?

1533
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:34,816
You okay?

1534
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:37,264
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1535
00:57:37,264 --> 00:57:38,973
- Don't put your fingers
down on an ice skating rink.

1536
00:57:38,973 --> 00:57:40,056
- Okay, okay.

1537
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:44,696
I'm sorry Jack, there's no more life raft.

1538
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:46,446
You have to go alone.

1539
00:58:14,629 --> 00:58:15,462
- [Conner] No fucking
way can I get on there.

1540
00:58:15,462 --> 00:58:17,055
- [Kane] Dude, you all right?

1541
00:58:17,055 --> 00:58:19,426
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

1542
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:20,622
- Hey.

1543
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,722
Um, can you get on the ice?

1544
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:24,986
- No fucking way, no way.

1545
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:28,467
No way, I don't even think
I should be standing.

1546
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:29,842
- Why don't you go sit down then?

1547
00:58:29,842 --> 00:58:30,675
- All right, going.

1548
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:31,594
- I'm over this.

1549
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:32,427
- [Conner] You all right?

1550
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:33,260
- Yeah.

1551
00:58:34,912 --> 00:58:36,579
- Coming on the ice.

1552
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,252
Okay.

1553
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:41,826
Please, please.

1554
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:43,918
- [Conner] No, dude, like no, come on.

1555
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:44,776
- [Hannah] Conner, we're
never gonna be here again.

1556
00:58:44,776 --> 00:58:46,707
- Dude, stop controlling me.

1557
00:58:46,707 --> 00:58:49,540
It's okay, I just don't
wanna go on the ice

1558
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,647
this one time.

1559
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:51,669
It's fine.

1560
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:52,771
- [Hannah] Why not?

1561
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:54,192
- Because I'm not into it.

1562
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:55,663
- [Hannah] But why, just for me,

1563
00:58:55,663 --> 00:58:56,958
like why won't you do it?

1564
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,355
- I don't want to, stop trying
to force me into it, please.

1565
00:58:59,355 --> 00:59:01,014
- [Hannah] You know what,
okay, take a picture with me.

1566
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:02,098
- [Conner] I'll take a picture with you.

1567
00:59:02,098 --> 00:59:03,099
- Take a picture.

1568
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:04,102
Do you have the camera?

1569
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:05,854
Do you have your camera?

1570
00:59:05,854 --> 00:59:09,219
- [Katherine] It's in there I think.

1571
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,466
- Why are you limping?

1572
00:59:10,466 --> 00:59:11,506
- [Conner] I'm not limping.

1573
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,167
- [Hannah] Yes you are.

1574
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,166
Come back here.

1575
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:16,087
- [Conner] What are you
looking at my ankle for?

1576
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:17,785
- [Hannah] Why is your ankle bandaged up?

1577
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:19,366
- To keep it warm in the cold

1578
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:21,107
'cause a sock is not
enough with this ankle.

1579
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:22,562
- [Hannah] Is this ankle bandaged up?

1580
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:24,792
- Stop it, stop fucking mothering me.

1581
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:25,797
What is wrong with you?

1582
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:27,461
- What, why do you have
your ankle bandaged up?

1583
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:28,561
- Because it's cold.

1584
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:29,559
- What happened?

1585
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,167
- I tripped over the fucking bathroom.

1586
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,221
It's not a problem, leave me alone.

1587
00:59:32,221 --> 00:59:33,220
- What?

1588
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,094
- Would you, fuck, why
do you always do this?

1589
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:36,163
- We need to go to the doctor.

1590
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:37,162
- No we don't need to go

1591
00:59:37,162 --> 00:59:37,995
to the doctor.
- Yes we do.

1592
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,459
Kane, Kane!

1593
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:40,515
- If we needed to go to the doctor.

1594
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:41,348
- Kane!

1595
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:42,429
- Look at me, look at me!

1596
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:43,606
If I needed to go to the doctor,

1597
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:44,844
I would have gone to the doctor.

1598
00:59:44,844 --> 00:59:46,335
- No, Conner, you.
- It's my life, it's my body,

1599
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:47,574
I know what to do with it.

1600
00:59:47,574 --> 00:59:48,407
- You never take care of yourself.

1601
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:49,240
- I always take care of myself.

1602
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,089
- You have an audition tomorrow!

1603
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:51,278
- I know I have an audition tomorrow.

1604
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:52,340
- You're gonna fuck it up!

1605
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,335
- I'm not gonna fuck up now.

1606
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:54,168
- Yes it is.

1607
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:56,609
- What's the doctor gonna
do before tomorrow, huh?

1608
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:59,699
What's a doctor gonna do before tomorrow?

1609
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,699
- [Hannah] Okay, you're not on your foot

1610
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:01,698
for the rest of the day.

1611
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,319
How bad is it, how bad is it?

1612
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:04,313
- It's not that bad.

1613
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:05,146
I can walk.

1614
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:05,979
- Can you dance on it?

1615
01:00:05,979 --> 01:00:07,130
- Yes, I think I can dance on it.

1616
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,383
- You need print, you need to hold him up.

1617
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:10,533
- [Kane] He's fine.

1618
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:11,981
- [Hannah] No he's not, he's limping.

1619
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:12,814
- I'm fine, Kane, I'm fine.
- He's fine.

1620
01:00:12,814 --> 01:00:13,873
- [Hannah] He hurt himself.

1621
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:16,790
- Hannah, take a pill and fuck off.

1622
01:00:17,832 --> 01:00:18,832
- Dude, just forget it.

1623
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:22,249
If it was that bad, he'd be sitting down.

1624
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:52,723
Does anyone want a drink, beer?

1625
01:00:52,723 --> 01:00:53,725
- [Hannah] No.

1626
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:54,723
- [Kane] Do you want a beer, Conner?

1627
01:00:54,723 --> 01:00:56,722
- [Conner] Sure, chuck us one.

1628
01:00:56,722 --> 01:00:58,767
- Is this your half empty one?

1629
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:00,166
- [Conner] It could be
yeah, from last night.

1630
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,247
Yeah bring me that, that'll do.

1631
01:01:01,247 --> 01:01:04,164
- [Kane] Bring you that, all right.

1632
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:06,866
Cheers, man.

1633
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:07,866
- Hey, guys.

1634
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:12,869
What happened?

1635
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,637
- [Conner] When?

1636
01:01:16,637 --> 01:01:18,710
- With your foot, what happened?

1637
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,232
How did you hurt yourself?

1638
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:23,732
- I just told you, I said taking a shower.

1639
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:29,287
- [Hannah] Katherine?

1640
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:30,120
- [Katherine] Yeah?

1641
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,453
- What happened?

1642
01:01:35,302 --> 01:01:36,869
Can you come out here please?

1643
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:38,313
- [Katherine] I'm just cleaning up.

1644
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:40,896
- Can you come out here please?

1645
01:01:42,553 --> 01:01:43,792
Why are you smirking?

1646
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:47,701
- [Katherine] I'm not
smirking, I'm not smirking.

1647
01:01:47,701 --> 01:01:49,189
- [Hannah] Why do you
guys think this is funny?

1648
01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:51,222
- It's not funny, it's not funny.

1649
01:01:51,222 --> 01:01:52,868
I'm just uncomfortable, it's not funny.

1650
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:54,086
- You're just making a big, yeah.

1651
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,224
- I just feel uncomfortable, I'm sorry.

1652
01:01:55,224 --> 01:01:56,230
- [Hannah] What happened?

1653
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:57,345
- You're just making a
big deal out of nothing.

1654
01:01:57,345 --> 01:01:59,523
- [Hannah] Tell me what happened!

1655
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:01,563
- Nothing, I tripped over
in the shower like I said.

1656
01:02:01,563 --> 01:02:04,101
- Why did he slip over
in the shower, Katherine?

1657
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:06,768
- [Conner] Because I was stoned.

1658
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:10,828
- [ Hannah] I will never forgive you

1659
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:13,133
if you are not telling me the truth.

1660
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:16,133
- Okay, we're not, we're not
not telling you the truth.

1661
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:17,926
He was stoned and he fell in the shower.

1662
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:19,466
Oh, I don't think it's funny.

1663
01:02:19,466 --> 01:02:20,749
I just, I'm sorry.

1664
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:22,183
I just feel really
uncomfortable right now.

1665
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:23,344
- [Hannah] This is my life.

1666
01:02:23,344 --> 01:02:25,756
- It's my life too, okay?

1667
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:27,845
- No, Katherine, this is my life.

1668
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:28,986
You are in my life.

1669
01:02:28,986 --> 01:02:30,859
You're in my house,
you're in my relationship,

1670
01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:34,089
and now Conner's been in you, right?

1671
01:02:34,089 --> 01:02:36,486
That's what's happened.

1672
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,539
This is my holiday with my brother.

1673
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:39,762
You and Kane came along

1674
01:02:39,762 --> 01:02:41,636
and you've been making it
about you the entire time

1675
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:44,851
and now he is not going to the
San Francisco Ballet company.

1676
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:46,570
- Pipe the fuck down for a sec.

1677
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,033
You brought me here for
San Francisco Ballet.

1678
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:51,200
It's your dream, not mine.

1679
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,267
You want me here.

1680
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:01,812
I'm good where I am.

1681
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:04,103
I have friends, I have a life.

1682
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:05,961
I have a job, I get paid.

1683
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:08,128
I work my fucking ass off.

1684
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,587
I do everything to keep myself afloat.

1685
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,319
And what are you here
doing, dicking around

1686
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:14,381
making fucking movies.

1687
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:15,214
- Hey.

1688
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:17,585
- Huh?

1689
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,828
And then I'm the irresponsible one

1690
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,909
when I need somebody that I
wanna maybe try something with?

1691
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:24,168
- Conner, can you put your
stuff aside for a second,

1692
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:26,072
understand that I miss you

1693
01:03:26,072 --> 01:03:29,535
and I want you to be
around and I need you.

1694
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,102
I need you here.

1695
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:35,028
- [Conner] You need me
but I don't need you.

1696
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:35,861
- Why not?

1697
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:43,022
I'm really struggling.

1698
01:03:44,135 --> 01:03:46,110
I'm really really struggling.

1699
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,193
I'm not okay.

1700
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:50,396
And I wanted you to be here.

1701
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:52,021
I want to know that you're safe.

1702
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,019
You're traveling around the world,

1703
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:54,020
you're going to all these countries

1704
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,950
with bombings in Paris last month.

1705
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,540
Like I need to know that you're safe

1706
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,919
because I can't lose
anybody else, I can't.

1707
01:04:00,919 --> 01:04:03,071
And for one weekend we two can be together

1708
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,632
now everything's fucked!

1709
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,866
- [Conner] Well maybe that's a good thing.

1710
01:04:06,866 --> 01:04:10,199
Maybe I shouldn't move to San Francisco.

1711
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:13,653
- Great, well.

1712
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:17,446
This doesn't matter anymore.

1713
01:04:17,446 --> 01:04:18,768
This doesn't matter.

1714
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:21,091
And he certainly doesn't
fucking matter, so.

1715
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:22,879
- What, what are you gonna do, huh?

1716
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:24,717
Where are you going?

1717
01:04:24,717 --> 01:04:27,491
Where the fuck are you going?

1718
01:04:27,491 --> 01:04:28,584
Bring back Bruv!

1719
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:30,244
Dude what the fuck?

1720
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:31,242
Hey what are you doing?

1721
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,241
You're throwing him in the fire?

1722
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:33,245
The fuck?

1723
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:34,745
No, no fuck, dude!

1724
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:38,986
Shit, get him out, get him out.

1725
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:40,413
- I am, I am.

1726
01:04:40,413 --> 01:04:41,415
- No, no, no, no.

1727
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:42,445
Bruv, Bruv, Bruv, Bruv!

1728
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,528
No, no, fuck!

1729
01:04:45,169 --> 01:04:46,002
You cunt!

1730
01:04:47,255 --> 01:04:48,088
Fuck you!

1731
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:48,921
- [Kane] Conner!

1732
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:49,816
- [Conner] Why the fuck
would you do that?!

1733
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:50,649
- [Kane] Conner!

1734
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:53,144
Conner, chill out!
- You fucking doghouse!

1735
01:04:53,144 --> 01:04:55,144
Just, great fucking job.

1736
01:04:57,515 --> 01:05:00,655
- [Kane] Don't fucking talk
to you sister that way.

1737
01:05:00,655 --> 01:05:02,712
(slamming)

1738
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,879
(sobbing)

1739
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:08,695
(phone ringing)

1740
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:11,652
- Hello?

1741
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:12,485
- [Michael] Hi.

1742
01:05:12,485 --> 01:05:14,088
- Oh yeah, hi Michael.

1743
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:15,420
- [Michael] Hello?

1744
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,253
- Yeah.

1745
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,086
- [Michael] Sweety, how are you?

1746
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:19,428
- Yeah, how did it go?

1747
01:05:19,428 --> 01:05:21,325
- [Michael] They went in
a different direction.

1748
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:22,347
I'm sorry.

1749
01:05:22,347 --> 01:05:23,890
- Oh, uh no, no, that's fine.

1750
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:25,148
I mean I'm used to it.

1751
01:05:25,148 --> 01:05:27,370
- [Michael] You know,
better luck next time.

1752
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,402
All that kind of stuff but

1753
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:30,058
we'll get the next one.

1754
01:05:30,058 --> 01:05:31,416
We'll get the next one, no worries.

1755
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:32,479
You're beautiful, you did great.

1756
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:34,148
- Yeah well anyway, have a great weekend.

1757
01:05:34,148 --> 01:05:35,832
- [Michael] Anyways yeah.

1758
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:36,932
- Say hi to Erica for me.

1759
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:38,957
- [Michael] Okay, I gotta go sweety.

1760
01:05:38,957 --> 01:05:40,211
I'm sorry, okay?

1761
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:41,503
Hang in there.

1762
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:42,586
