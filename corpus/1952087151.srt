1
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,024
those words have
a different meaning.

2
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:14,298
A darker meaning.

3
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:16,082
Yeah, everyone knows that.

4
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:18,431
They get people programmed
to do whatever.

5
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,099
Could be for sex
or, you know, kill a guy.

6
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:22,740
They're out there.

7
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,308
The dolls.

8
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:28,173
Seeming to crop up
first in the late '80s,

9
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,610
the Dollhouse is one of L.A.'s
most enduring urban legends.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,970
The story is simple.

11
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:36,253
Somewhere in the city
is an illegal establishment

12
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,318
that rents out to the very rich
and the very connected

13
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:40,925
programmable people.

14
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,255
People who can take on
any personality

15
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:44,696
except their own.

16
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,524
Nothing more
than science fiction

17
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,960
according to most everybody,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,934
a big foot for the big city.

19
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,431
But what's interesting
about this urban legend,

20
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,399
is the wide spectrum
of reactions we encountered

21
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,777
from everyday Angelenos
to the very idea of a Dollhouse.

22
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,212
Oh, it's happening.

23
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,658
is if they is one already.

24
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:16,655
Volunteers. You must be
out of your (bleep) mind.

25
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:20,064
So, being a doll,
you do whatever.

26
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:22,027
And you don't
got to remember nothing.

27
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:25,336
Or study.
Or pay rent.

28
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:28,740
And you just party
with rich people all the time?

29
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,675
Where's the dotted line?

30
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:33,205
A spokesperson
for the Governor insists

31
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,641
that this legend
is nothing more than that.

32
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:39,512
And stories of an F.B.I. task force
investigating the Dollhouse

33
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:41,419
have been flatly denied.

34
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,421
But the rumors persist.

35
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,384
And like every good fairy tale,

36
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,470
the story grows more intricate,

37
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,093
and more divisive,

38
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,762
every decade.

39
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,601
(T.V. clicks off,
remote clatters on desk)

40
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,316
You're out of
hand cream again.

41
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:15,480
This the alleged victim?

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,089
Guy said she had
a face. Damn.

43
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,618
No wonder you're foraging

44
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:20,959
for hand cream.

45
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,121
Had a million bucks,
I could blow it on that.

46
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,690
Did you track this
payment from Crestejo?

47
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,998
The Mayfair fund?

48
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,696
Told you to stay out
of my soup, Ballard.

49
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,865
Afraid you'll have
to reopen the case?

50
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:34,767
Act like a federal agent
for five minutes?

51
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,007
This is my report.

52
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,909
If there is some

53
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:40,205
giant conspiracy that's
sucking the brains

54
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,540
out of nice, young people,

55
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,909
then this bit of tail
that you're chasing

56
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,985
is A: effectively dead,

57
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,854
and B: a whore.

58
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,955
A mindless whore,

59
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:53,157
just your type.
No disrespect.

60
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm sure she still
has a heart of gold.

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,561
(Tanaka grunts)

62
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,663
What happened there, Ballard?

63
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,865
I strike a nerve?
Yeah.

64
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,809
I mean it.

65
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,472
Someone's going to put you down.

66
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:15,674
And I pray to God
I'm there to see it.

67
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:17,214
(groans)

68
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,950
Come by any time.

69
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,801
Sierra is alone.

70
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,804
I like to be alone sometimes.

71
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:42,140
It's peaceful.

72
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,544
Sierra sits with us most days.

73
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:49,446
Am I wrong?

74
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,184
When we go to sleep,

75
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,918
I hear her.

76
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:56,954
Maybe she
didn't see us.

77
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:12,737
Do you feel
uncomfortable at all?

78
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,806
No. Should I?

79
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,908
No.

80
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,309
Did Victor

81
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:21,746
upset you,
do you remember?

82
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,414
Victor wants to pretend.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,982
“pretend”?

84
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,767
He pretends we're married.

85
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:32,189
I see.

86
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:38,096
Something's up?
Yes.

87
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:40,865
Sierra's had sex.

88
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,033
No, sir.

89
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:43,300
You know for sure?

90
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,364
Her last engagement was
with the Governor's niece

91
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,033
at a children's
cancer ward.

92
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,306
I examined her

93
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,908
post-engagement anyway.

94
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:52,171
This happened
while she's been here.

95
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,191
What did she say about Victor?

96
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,146
That he liked to play.

97
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:58,577
Wait, the dolls
don't have sex drives.

98
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,663
That's part
of the deal, right?

99
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,057
them abusing each other.

100
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:15,199
If Victor's off-program,
then he could be

101
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,329
Jekyll and Hyde-ing
just like Alpha did.

102
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,398
We can't jump
to any conclusions.

103
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,065
No, but we can go
to the videotape.

104
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,167
How long has she…?

105
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,674
Two days.

106
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:26,939
If Victor was alone with her,
it won't take long to find.

107
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,640
Mr Hearn,
when you figure out

108
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,108
what happened…
Then I go to DeWitt.

109
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:32,549
If Victor is
playing doctor

110
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,480
when not imprinted
with an MD,

111
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,587
then he goes to the attic.

112
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,023
(door slams)

113
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,659
Victor wouldn't…

114
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,928
She did scream
when she saw him.

115
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,324
And we both know
he's been focused on her.

116
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,626
There's a difference

117
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,596
Between being attracted
to someone and hurting them.

118
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:51,864
Has she shown
any other sign?

119
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,365
Anything you can remember?

120
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,439
Echo:
When we go to sleep…

121
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:58,876
When we go in the pods,

122
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,812
Sierra cries.

123
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:14,158
I think you're right.

124
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,174
This is the Crestejo account.

125
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:20,694
Big payment to the Mayfair fund,
which means nothing.

126
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,896
Mayfair is a hedge,
and it's spread thin.

127
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,568
But that
payment went in

128
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,165
right when his daughter
was kidnapped.

129
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,201
And you still think he hired
the Dollhouse to get her back.

130
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,607
I surely do.

131
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,444
Now you have a similar sum

132
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,841
transferred to the Mayfair fund
from Q-Field.

133
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,108
And this is the fun part:

134
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,883
You have the same amount,

135
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,617
from Q-Field to Mayfair,

136
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:44,388
every year on
the exact same day.

137
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,685
Q-Field is a subsidiary
of Redwing,

138
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:47,786
a majority share of which

139
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,393
is held by…

140
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,128
Joel Mynor.

141
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,692
And Joel Mynor is
on your list of potential

142
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,299
Dollhouse clients.

143
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,196
Man, even I know
about this guy.

144
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:58,630
He's that internet mogul.

145
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,438
He created Sourceress,

146
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,860
with a fabulous nobody
on his arm.

147
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,031
I've liked this guy for a while.

148
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:18,050
You ever thought
about asking him out?

149
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,052
I'm never going to get
to Caroline.

150
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,754
Whoever she is,
the Dollhouse has buried her.

151
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:25,690
I've got to get to them first,
and Joel Mynor is my ticket.

152
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,228
Whatever he's paying for,
it's happening soon.

153
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:30,268
I need
everything on him.

154
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,431
You mean everything
admissible by a warrant

155
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,000
that you got,
because anybody

156
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,472
in the whole wide bureau
believes you're not insane.

157
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,578
I mean help me out.

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,118
Getting shot didn't even make
you pause, did it?

159
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,391
I'll help you.

160
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,553
The Director sees
what we're up to,

161
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,695
he's going to help you out.

162
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:02,063
So the one fund got transferred
to the other fund,

163
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,569
How do you think
I can afford

164
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,405
To take you to all these
fancy places?

165
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,840
Hey, this is the nicest
offer I've had this month.

166
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,814
Or last month.

167
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:20,717
Weren't you,
um, seeing someone?

168
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:22,186
Hmm?
Rick.

169
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,654
Dick.

170
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,617
Really?
I thought it was Rick.

171
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,225
Oh, his name is Rick.

172
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,926
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:30,789
He said he didn't see me
as “a long-term investment.”

174
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:31,957
Said he wanted to, uh,

175
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,159
“dump the stock
before it went public.”

176
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,732
He talks like that.

177
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,263
He works at a doughnut shop.

178
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:40,171
What a Rick.

179
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,735
Yeah. Hey, I get that I'm not
the gold standard in I.A.

180
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,909
Please, you're gorgeous.

181
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:50,247
But I do have access
to important

182
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,416
government information
that I don't understand.

183
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:55,752
It boils down to this:

184
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,050
Today was a slightly better day
for the good guys

185
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,817
than it was for the bad guys.

186
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:03,817
Just one more tiny step to get
me closer to bringing her in.

187
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,264
“her” is being held captive
by “them.”

188
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,833
Along with a lot of other
people, if I'm right.

189
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,269
So if I really catch
my client in the act tomorrow

190
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:20,444
with a doll, I'm closer
to freeing them all.

191
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,780
Including, but not limited to,
“her.”

192
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,782
Is that fair?

193
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,852
It's your job.

194
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,597
We're all clear in there.

195
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,994
Okay, I don't want
to see anybody

196
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,695
in the house
or around the house,

197
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:44,997
and that includes the boys.

198
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,237
They get it.

199
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:48,020
You'll be very much alone.

200
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:13,725
Louanne's covering for me,

201
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,026
so this can't
take forever.

202
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,535
You may have
to owe her one.

203
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,104
I did something.

204
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:20,571
Something bad?

205
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:41,125
<i>Woman:
Oh, Joel.</i>

206
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:43,955
<i>Joel:
The oven, uh,
gets food so hot,</i>

207
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,657
<i>it actually goes
through this thing called</i>

208
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:47,864
<i>the “cooking process.”</i>

209
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,028
<i>It's very scientific.
(woman giggles)</i>

210
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,698
<i>Um, and I think there's
something in the fridge.</i>

211
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,179
I'd like you both to
turn around very slowly.

212
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,087
If they'd had it in my day,

213
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,149
I'd have had Betty Grable
every night.

214
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,490
Or Ida Lupino.

215
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,493
Every man that fought
for his country

216
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,923
should have the right
to an Ida Lupino.

217
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,764
You mean if it was real?

218
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:59,300
If I could hire a doll
and he could

219
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,570
be anyone and do anything
with no consequences,

220
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:11,373
I think you've
made a mistake.

221
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:12,474
What's happening?

222
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,081
Caroline?

223
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,644
Okay, you've definitely
made a mistake.

224
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:16,812
What do you call her?

225
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,113
Please put the gun away.

226
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,320
My name is

227
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,883
Rebecca Mynor, and this
is my husband, Joel.

228
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,219
We just bought
this house.

229
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,426
We did, right?

230
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,522
You didn't just break
in to impress me?

231
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:28,657
No, it-it's paid for.

232
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,024
This is all a big mix-up.

233
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,360
Please tell me
your name.

234
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,667
I'm Paul Ballard.

235
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:33,829
I'm with the F.B. I…

236
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,071
I knew it.
What?

237
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,607
It's porn, isn't it?

238
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,204
The internet venture
that suddenly pays off.

239
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,479
You did porn!

240
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,307
My husband does porn!
No, I don't do porn!

241
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,742
You're in huge trouble.

242
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,234
Your name is Caroline.

243
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,812
You don't know this,
but you're being fooled.

244
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,812
You're being used.

245
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:51,814
Okay,
I'm giving you

246
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,215
one last chance to leave.

247
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,188
Joel,

248
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,884
please don't make him angry.

249
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:57,525
I would never hurt you.

250
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,054
(taser clicking)
(grunts)

251
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:02,460
I'm so sorry, Mr Mynor,
he attacked one of our men.

252
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,206
Sweetie…
I…

253
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,253
(men grunting, Echo screaming)

254
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,421
God!

255
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,824
Joel!
You need a treatment.

256
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,828
(screams)
Joel…

257
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,665
Porn.

258
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,768
(all grunting)

259
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,199
(tires screeching)

260
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,573
(engine roaring)

261
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,210
(coughs)

262
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,872
Hope you're not thinking
about leaving, Mr Mynor.

263
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,046
Can I assume

264
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:55,115
none of my security guys
need an ambulance

265
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,652
or a hearse?

266
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
They'll be fine.

267
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:03,523
Why don't you, uh, tell me
what you're looking for?

268
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,127
(laughing):
The doll…

269
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,370
Uh, it's pink and it opens up

270
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,572
and there's teeny furniture,

271
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,075
and you put the boy doll
on top of the girl doll

272
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,010
and we learn about urges.

273
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,316
What's her name?

274
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,753
Rebecca—
she told you.

275
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,754
Really?

276
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:34,405
How do you
know Rebecca?

277
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,218
We've been married
for seven years.

278
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,958
(chuckles)

279
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,321
So that's your fantasy?

280
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,830
All the money in the world,
the most elaborate,

281
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,160
high-class underground
operation ever designed,

282
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,735
and you just want
to play house?

283
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,565
I guess the rich
really are different.

284
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,932
Why, what's your fantasy?

285
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:53,001
Oh, I'm okay right here
in the real world, thanks.

286
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,376
Oh, don't, no,
you have a fantasy.

287
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:56,744
Okay, we all do.

288
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,073
We need it to survive,

289
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,615
and I think your fantasy

290
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,461
But then

291
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:16,565
the brave little F.B.I. agent
whisked her away

292
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:17,659
from the cash-wielding losers

293
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,468
and restored
her true identity,

294
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:23,571
and she fell in love with him.

295
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,899
It doesn't go like that.

296
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,202
(scoffing):
I saw how you were with her.

297
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,544
It was,
it was almost cute.

298
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,373
We're not here to talk about me.
Hey,

299
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:33,274
I don't have to be here at all.

300
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,478
I mean, you're not going
to arrest me.

301
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,553
Pretty sure you're not going
to kill me, so…

302
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,089
If we're going to talk,
we're both going to talk.

303
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:46,994
I mean, she,
she changed things for you.

304
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:51,766
So you're the head
of this F.B.I. task force

305
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:55,102
to uncover the Dollhouse,

306
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,399
and you're working hard,
you're chasing leads,

307
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,709
you're cracking skulls,
but it's just work.

308
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:11,752
And suddenly…

309
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,753
(cork pops)

310
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,389
it gets personal.

311
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,396
Tell me you haven't
thought about it.

312
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,093
You know, her,
her grateful tears,

313
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:30,037
her, her welcoming embrace,
her warm breath.

314
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,006
Are you married?

315
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,107
Was.

316
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,107
Oh,

317
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,275
That's…

318
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:37,673
Is there someone
in your life right now?

319
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,646
This is getting old.

320
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:40,948
Of course not.

321
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,178
No, there's no room
for a real girl, is there,

322
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,986
when you can feel

323
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,622
Caroline beckoning?

324
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,353
(chuckling): You know, I have to say
I-I think your fantasy

325
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,761
is even sadder than mine.

326
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,190
Won't know until I hear it.

327
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,163
Well,

328
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,467
it didn't involve
drinking alone.

329
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:12,674
Sierra is different.

330
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,381
How is she different?

331
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,785
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,887
Victor,

333
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,189
do you remember being in
the showers with Sierra?

334
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:25,993
You were watching her?

335
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,262
How does Sierra make you feel?

336
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,034
Better.

337
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,830
I can't believe this.
I'm filling in

338
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,499
for Ramirez for a week and
my active invents rape?

339
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,535
We don't know
what happened yet.

340
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,437
Victor might have just
triggered a memory.

341
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,410
Well, Hearn's
out for blood.

342
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,774
Hearn hasn't found
anything on the tapes.

343
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,448
Nobody has.

344
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:48,877
How is that
even possible?

345
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,612
Every square inch of
this place is monitored.

346
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,754
If two actives
are going at it…

347
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,390
What do you think
DeWitt'll do?

348
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,570
You think she'll
come down hard?

349
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,906
It was probably
just a mistake.

350
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,707
They're all broken.

351
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:22,583
Rebecca was amazing.

352
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,753
She was a nurse and…

353
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,049
(laughing):
I was a basket case,

354
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,124
So, you know,
not a, not a bad match.

355
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,927
I was the guy
with the almost great idea—

356
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:38,100
floogle
and blahoo! And facebooger.

357
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,502
I was, I was just always
one step behind,

358
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,638
and she was cool with it.

359
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,667
And did she look
exactly like Caroline?

360
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,775
No, but—

361
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:51,879
Eat it, f-bitch-I—
she was beautiful

362
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,414
and she knew it
and she loved me.

363
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:56,117
I mean, I had been…

364
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,446
(sighing):
I had been given a gift.

365
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,521
And now you're hiring zombies.

366
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,732
Place is empty.

367
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,068
Shame— big place.

368
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,069
(scoffs)

369
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,403
This place.

370
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,500
This place could fit
in my bathroom.

371
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,003
I mean, this place could fit
in my guest bathroom.

372
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,009
All right?

373
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,672
I mean, I finally got
one step ahead.

374
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,412
“Bouncy the Rat.”

375
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,774
Kids love it.
Ooh, they do.

376
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:30,686
I mean,
long story still kind of long,

377
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,254
my first check had more zeros
than the Luftwaffe.

378
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:35,255
The Japanese—

379
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:38,559
They had the Zeros,
not the Germans.

380
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,260
(sighs)

381
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:41,662
It was money.

382
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,591
All right, it was
roll-around-in money

383
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,299
and Rebecca had no idea.

384
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,262
She'd been supporting
the both of us for years.

385
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:48,496
I mean ridiculous hours.

386
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,065
We were living
in a one-room shack,

387
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,140
and I knew this house
was exactly her type.

388
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,477
I paid cash and I called her up.

389
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,473
I said,
“meet me at this address,

390
00:19:58,513 --> 00:19:59,474
it's really important,”

391
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,494
and she was worried,
you know,

392
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,961
thinking about the look
on her face

393
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,630
when she saw this place

394
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,466
and I told her it was ours.

395
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,407
Sanitation truck…

396
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:30,111
sideswiped her car…

397
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,413
three blocks from here,

398
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,219
and I heard the impact and…
(sighs)

399
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:41,188
they said it was quick.

400
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:46,061
I guess that, you know,
they always have to say that.

401
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,528
Right?

402
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:52,199
But she never got
to see this house,

403
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:55,870
and she never knew I made good.

404
00:20:55,938 --> 00:21:00,641
So every year on this date,

405
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,489
And then you sleep with her.

406
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,958
It is a fantasy.

407
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,262
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr Mynor.

408
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,524
It doesn't make you anything
other than a predator.

409
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:27,796
Well, I'm sure I'm in need of
some serious moral spankitude,

410
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:32,039
but, uh, guess who's not
qualified to be my rabbi.

411
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,870
Well, I'm perfectly happy
to let a federal judge…

412
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,304
Throw you in jail, hmm?

413
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:39,880
I mean, we got trespassing,
we got assault,

414
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,244
<i>and what you've
got is a girl</i>

415
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,411
you're obsessed with,

416
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:47,087
who I think we can both agree
is not here.

417
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,384
I mean, this is not
“beat up the geek,” big guy.

418
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,485
This is
the internet establishment.

419
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:55,022
<i>You put me in front of a judge,
he'll take you down.</i>

420
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:56,892
He'll throw the Kindle at you.

421
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,232
(siren wailing)

422
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:02,036
(chuckling):
Oh… Oh.

423
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,242
You might not be punished
and I might not be alive,

424
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:15,844
but this house will fall.

425
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:19,753
The first hurdle
in my business is the people

426
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,350
who will not accept the change
that's already happened.

427
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,623
Go.

428
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:26,426
Go live in
your real world.

429
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:29,296
If you ever did.

430
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:35,035
Happy anniversary.

431
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,434
If you could have somebody be
the perfect person,

432
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:47,927
the moment you wish for that you
know you're never going to get,

433
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:50,376
and someone signed on
to do that,

434
00:22:50,444 --> 00:22:53,946
to help you…

435
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:57,616
I think that could be okay.

436
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:02,188
I think that could be
maybe beautiful.

437
00:23:57,777 --> 00:24:00,413
This is Boyd Langton
for Mr Dominic.

438
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,701
I did something bad.

439
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,903
What did you do?

440
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,739
Nobody will tell me.

441
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,341
Victor, I need you

442
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,771
to come with me, please.

443
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:32,078
Where?

444
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,455
I need you to come
with me, please.

445
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:41,134
Why did Sierra scream at me?

446
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,990
Bicks:
Who authorized this?

447
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,219
I didn't rape
the doll.

448
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,061
Lawrence, Lawrence,
I didn't do this.

449
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,190
You know me, man.

450
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,324
I wouldn't do this, man.

451
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,792
Come on, you know
I didn't do this!

452
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,100
I didn't do this!

453
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,995
Where are they
taking Victor?

454
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,304
Why don't you go
paint something?

455
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,805
Nice work, man.

456
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,917
Not anymore.

457
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,113
Mellie:
Is this enough?

458
00:25:13,153 --> 00:25:14,354
Thanks.

459
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,054
Are you, uh, always
gonna show up bleeding?

460
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:22,744
'cause it's kind
of funny

461
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,863
how I'm not
getting used to it.

462
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,168
It was her.

463
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,902
You met Caroline?

464
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,238
I saw Caroline.

465
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:33,572
I met Rebecca.

466
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,469
And I let both of
them get away.

467
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:36,809
So, it's all true.

468
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,071
I knew it was true.

469
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,212
I just didn't expect…

470
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,041
If it had been
anybody else,

471
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,543
the jail cells
would be full,

472
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,279
and I'd be busy writing the
great American arrest report.

473
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,814
I never thought
it would be her.

474
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,174
Did you get the guy?

475
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:51,423
The… John,
the… client.

476
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:52,877
What are they called?

477
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:55,461
I talked to him.

478
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,962
And?

479
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,378
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,079
I'm not.

481
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:15,548
I mean, I am.

482
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,982
I-I mean, you are.

483
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,116
Don't do that.

484
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:19,912
Don't inflate the stock
before you dump it.

485
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,587
Uh…

486
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:24,990
Don't think about her
and kiss me.

487
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:27,159
I wasn't, uh…

488
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:28,895
Forget it.

489
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,029
I think it's best
we forget it.

490
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:32,125
Would be stupid, anyway.

491
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,533
We're neighbors,
we should just…

492
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,862
we should be
neighborly.

493
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:36,835
Great.

494
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:37,836
Yes.

495
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:38,970
Neighborly.

496
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,433
Can I borrow
a cup of sugar?

497
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,507
(both laughing)

498
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,809
Like that.

499
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:47,312
So, why don't you tell me
about today.

500
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,584
The guy's name was Joel Mynor.

501
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:55,360
<i>Joel Mynor from
Bouncy the Rat?</i>

502
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,992
Do you trust me?

503
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,861
With my life.

504
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:37,842
Do you want to play the game?

505
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,400
No.

506
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:46,505
But you remember to be very
quiet during the game, right?

507
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:49,308
Noise is upsetting.

508
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,777
Lift up your dress.

509
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:01,520
That wasn't quiet.

510
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,543
He had to be flush
with success,

511
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,462
or he'd never
have tried again.

512
00:28:15,502 --> 00:28:17,230
You will never take
action like that

513
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,931
on your own again
inside these walls.

514
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:19,905
Am I clear?

515
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:22,541
You're clear.

516
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,971
A bonus has been wired
to your account.

517
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,379
I don't need a bonus.

518
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:31,049
Well, I need to give it to you.

519
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:32,584
That's all.

520
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,655
Ms Dewitt.

521
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,028
(sighs)

522
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,894
What do we do with Hearn?

523
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,168
I'll let you know.

524
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:53,271
And you saw the other
thing, the tap?

525
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:56,835
<i>Joel Mynor from Bouncy the Rat?</i>

526
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,251
<i>He was on the cover of Wired.</i>

527
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:13,926
Do you have an
exit strategy?

528
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:17,027
We have a handler
abusing an active,

529
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:19,460
a federal agent
interrupting an engagement,

530
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,272
spilling his guts
to the nearest civilian.

531
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:25,035
I take much of that
as my responsibility,

532
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,539
but the higher-ups

533
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,136
will target you if
this all goes south.

534
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:33,178
Your concern is touching,
but my bags are not packed.

535
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:35,680
You will bring
the handler to me.

536
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,750
And as for the intrepid agent…

537
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,420
Tell Topher to prep Echo.

538
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:46,592
I think they're ready
for a second date.

539
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,157
Hey, everyone's got
their fantasies, right?

540
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,960
A guy wants to know
what it's like,

541
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,178
you know, to be
with another man.

542
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,002
just once,
nothing queeny.

543
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:11,699
(chuckles awkwardly)

544
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,361
Oh-ho.

545
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:27,996
You're bad.

546
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,230
Mmm.

547
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,703
You're a naughty girl.

548
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,738
Oh.

549
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,273
Okay.

550
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,479
<i>Uh… But you're
not that girl.</i>

551
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:48,883
That girl has
control issues

552
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:52,247
that don't mesh well with the
enhanced combat skill set.

553
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:54,488
You can re-cluster
the inhibitors

554
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:56,050
to offset the dissonance.

555
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,554
Don't we want aggression?

556
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:59,729
And precision.

557
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:01,461
I need a
soupcon of rage.

558
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,307
(sighs)

559
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,939
Find out if the kitchen
has the almond-crusted salmon.

560
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:20,016
I live to serve lunch.

561
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:27,723
Uh-huh.

562
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,926
And hello, gorgeous but deadly.

563
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:40,334
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

564
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:46,875
Upload imprint to file drive.

565
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,244
(humming)

566
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:51,680
Topher.

567
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:54,816
I'm in my process.

568
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,350
I'm…

569
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,481
What's the scuttlebutt?

570
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,521
Echo's been engaged.

571
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,913
That's 48 hours chill time, min.

572
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:16,070
What is she doing?

573
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,371
Echo?

574
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:21,342
Oh… Life coach gig.

575
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,914
You know, remind some doctor
why he helps kids

576
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:29,283
who have, you know, gross kids.

577
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,314
They don't think
I can handle that?

578
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:34,483
Uh, not everything
is about you, infinite ego man.

579
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:36,185
You know, you did
nail the guy

580
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,386
who was messing
with Sierra.

581
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:39,655
You should go out and get drunk
and beat your chest.

582
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,330
Echo will be here
when you get back.

583
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:43,732
Hey.

584
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,360
How did you figure out
it was Hearn, anyway?

585
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,004
Is it a cop thing?

586
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,639
Reading people?

587
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,473
You do the work.

588
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,543
Well…

589
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:57,078
Good work.

590
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:59,146
(humming)

591
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:13,662
(typing)

592
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,301
Ready to play?

593
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:26,432
Adelle: Can you imagine at all
why it is you are not dead?

594
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,472
You probably got
something worse planned.

595
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:32,848
You gonna erase my brain,

596
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:35,750
turn me into one
of your fantasy boys?

597
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:38,247
I find it a bit sad
that you think of yourself

598
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:41,322
as a candldate
for anyone's fantasy.

599
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:43,753
Ah, you know you're
a little sweet on me.

600
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,061
(screaming)

601
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,262
(Hearn hyperventilating)

602
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,930
You think I'm
gonna beg?

603
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,226
You want to kill me?

604
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:52,862
You want to put me in the attic?

605
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:54,570
I can't stop you.

606
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:56,404
The jig is up.

607
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:57,461
How many times?

608
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,406
(panting)

609
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:02,577
I can find out, but I want
to hear it from you.

610
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,048
it makes it better
because she thinks

611
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,815
she's in love for
all of a day?

612
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,585
We're in the business
of using people.

613
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,720
You understand less about
this business than you think.

614
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,323
And you don't get how it
actually works down there.

615
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:22,091
You put a bunch
of stone foxes

616
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:23,593
with no willpower
and no memory

617
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,398
running around naked.

618
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,997
Did you think this
wouldn't ever happen?

619
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:30,939
Did it make it better?

620
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,607
That she didn't struggle?

621
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:35,211
No.

622
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:37,578
It made it easier.

623
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,692
Mr Dominic, would you leave us?

624
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,684
Ms Dewitt, I…

625
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:43,814
I'll be perfectly safe.

626
00:34:43,854 --> 00:34:45,719
Please.

627
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,788
<i>We are in the business
of using people.</i>

628
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:56,363
The question is,
what is the best use

629
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,432
for someone like you?

630
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,281
really.

631
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:15,011
I need her killed,
and it can't be clean.

632
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,413
This is your chance
to avoid the attic.

633
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:20,889
You may even consider it
something of a promotion.

634
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:22,523
After all,

635
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,225
this one will…

636
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:26,395
probably struggle.

637
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:29,531
(breathing heavily, moaning)

638
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:49,482
My God.

639
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,520
You're so…

640
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,188
Neighborly.

641
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:55,555
(both chuckling)

642
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,658
So…

643
00:35:57,727 --> 00:35:59,793
Can I borrow a
cup of sugar?

644
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:01,162
(laughing)

645
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,211
(groaning)

646
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,814
I'm not gonna
freak out on you.

647
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:22,350
Uh… good.

648
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:24,314
When you tell me this
is all a mistake

649
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:25,780
and we should forget
it ever happened,

650
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,521
I'm gonna be very cool.

651
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,362
You're gonna be bothered
by how cool I am.

652
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:33,461
What if I don't say that?

653
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,655
I'll still be cool,

654
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,064
<i>But not as cool.</i>

655
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,628
<i>What if you tell me
it was a mistake?</i>

656
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:42,170
Oh, God, you're
gonna be so clingy,

657
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:43,492
weeping and moping,

658
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,840
texting me.

659
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,235
It's too embarrassing.

660
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,538
I am not a piece of meat,
you know.

661
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,360
I have a heart.
(chuckling)

662
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:53,248
Blah, blah.

663
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:01,621
I was thinking
about Caroline.

664
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,128
I think what they're
doing is wrong.

665
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:14,128
And I don't love seeing
you get beat up

666
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:16,104
and shot, but…

667
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,218
I think your work
is important.

668
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,344
Then help me out.

669
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,374
Is this the part where you
dress me up and use me as bait?

670
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,724
'cause those movies
never end well.

671
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,780
It's the part where I run
down to Tiki Port

672
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,756
and grab us dinner
and we go over my files

673
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:38,452
and you give me your
perspective on some stuff.

674
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,428
Might see something
I didn't.

675
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:42,262
You think I'd be helpful?

676
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:43,932
Yeah.

677
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,962
That's the sweetest thing
you've done for me all day.

678
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:48,938
Well…

679
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,439
What about the,
um…

680
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:53,441
the other things?
(chuckles)

681
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,375
Fetch me spring rolls.

682
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:59,146
Then we'll bust this case
wide open.

683
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:02,184
(distant traffic noise,
horns honking)

684
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,883
Whoever you are,

685
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,745
I swear I don't want
to hurt you.

686
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:38,354
I know.

687
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,154
(groans)

688
00:38:42,691 --> 00:38:44,225
I'm counting on it.

689
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,524
You think it's not happening?

690
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,540
<i>You think they're not controlling you?</i>

691
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:54,120
Don't worry about it.

692
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,129
Just sit back

693
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:59,064
and wait for them to tell you
what to buy.

694
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,535
(groans)

695
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,180
(groans)

696
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,852
(grunting)

697
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,926
(groans)

698
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,768
(groans)

699
00:39:36,637 --> 00:39:38,539
(pots clanging)

700
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,111
(groans)

701
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:52,953
(bowls and plates crashing)

702
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,357
(grunting)
(groans)

703
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,627
(groans)

704
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:17,529
(grunting)
(groaning)

705
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:26,320
(groans)

706
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,156
(groans)

707
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:45,238
(groans)

708
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,176
(panting)

709
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:51,211
The Dollhouse is real.

710
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:52,507
They know you're
after them

711
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,907
and they are going
to have you taken

712
00:40:53,947 --> 00:40:55,644
off the case.
That's why they sent me.

713
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,684
(panting)

714
00:40:58,918 --> 00:41:00,887
Why are you
telling me this?

715
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:12,993
This is their first
communication.

716
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:16,000
Security inside
is very tight.

717
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,004
Where is it?

718
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,305
You can't know that.

719
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,335
You're going about this
the wrong way.

720
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,870
I have to take down
the Dollhouse.

721
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,472
There are over 20 Dollhouses,

722
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:27,379
in cities around
the world.

723
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:28,476
They have ties
to every

724
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:30,511
major political power
on the planet.

725
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:32,546
You cannot possibly
stop them alone.

726
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,387
You're going to help me?

727
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:36,897
The person that
sent this message is.

728
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,559
Why?

729
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,592
The Dollhouse

730
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,782
Deals in fantasy.

731
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,054
That is their business,

732
00:41:42,094 --> 00:41:43,925
but that is not their purpose.

733
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,430
What is?

734
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,434
We need you to find out.

735
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,663
We'll contact
you again—

736
00:41:48,703 --> 00:41:51,137
if possible,
with this same body.

737
00:41:51,203 --> 00:41:53,740
But you have to let
the Dollhouse win.

738
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,875
Make them back off.

739
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:58,844
You have to trust me.

740
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,814
(footfalls)
he's got

741
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,324
No.
You have to go.

742
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:13,760
They don't want

743
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:16,856
to kill you, but they will
protect the information.

744
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:17,624
Call an ambulance!

745
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,266
Officer down!
Go!

746
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:20,761
You can't just….
They will protect

747
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:22,268
the information.

748
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:23,331
They don't want
you dead.

749
00:42:23,371 --> 00:42:24,493
But anyone else….

750
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:26,205
Mellie.

751
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,742
(door lock clicks)

752
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,293
(screams)

753
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,027
(screams)

754
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:00,004
(crying)

755
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:15,521
(grunting)

756
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,021
(crying)

757
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,786
Paul (on machine):
Leave a message.

758
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:22,027
Adelle: There are
three flowers in a vase.

759
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:25,832
The third flower is green.

760
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:27,566
(groans)

761
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,469
(groaning)

762
00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:42,314
There are three flowers
in a vase.

763
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:44,350
The third flower

764
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:46,418
is yellow.

765
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:52,559
(crying)

766
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:28,540
Forget morality.
Imagine it's true.

767
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,890
Imagine this technology
being used.

768
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:35,314
Now imagine it being used
on you.

769
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,316
Everything you believe,

770
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,818
gone.

771
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,320
Everyone you love, strangers.

772
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,555
Maybe enemies.

773
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,557
Every part of you
that makes you more

774
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:49,229
than a walking cluster
of neurons

775
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:52,230
dissolved
at someone else's whim.

776
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:55,066
If that technology exists—

777
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,234
It'll be used.

778
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,238
It'll be abused.

779
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:00,238
It'll be global.

780
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,112
Dominic: I understand.
Thank you.

781
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:47,887
We'll talk soon.

782
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,917
Agent Paul Ballard was
suspended of duty pending

783
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,419
an investigation into the
shooting of Officer Hardin.

784
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,428
Accusations of violent
paranoia, the attack

785
00:45:56,496 --> 00:45:57,792
on Mr Mynor's bodyguards,

786
00:45:57,832 --> 00:45:59,526
the feud with
the Borodins,

787
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:02,602
as evidenced by the break-in
at his apartment.

788
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:12,611
I replayed the tap.

789
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,113
More than once?

790
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,476
It did not lack
for poetry.

791
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:18,449
Bring her in so Topher
can run a diagnostic.

792
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:20,453
Are we pulling her?

793
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,481
Now that Ballard's
off the case?

794
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:23,749
No. A man like Ballard

795
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:25,185
doesn't take himself
out of the game,

796
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:26,658
just because of this.

797
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:28,660
Besides…

798
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:30,662
She loves him.

799
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,292
You played
a good hand, ma'am.

800
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:33,960
I played a very bad
hand very well.

801
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,128
There is a distinction.

802
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,168
Of course.

803
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:43,269
I want you to contact
your counterparts

804
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:44,437
in all the other houses,

805
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:46,038
tell them about what
happened to Sierra.

806
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:48,012
That won't look
good for you.

807
00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:49,949
It can't happen again.

808
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,516
Anywhere.

809
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,617
She's alright?

810
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,515
Topher did everything
he knows

811
00:46:55,555 --> 00:46:59,492
to remove the experience.

812
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,160
Ignorance in this case,

813
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,473
Good day.

814
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,840
You have a book.

815
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:17,844
I enjoy looking at it.

816
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,746
Would you like to see?

817
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,562
Hello, Echo.

818
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,703
You've drawn a picture.

819
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,703
It's very good.

820
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,607
It isn't finished.

821
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:52,211
The picture?

822
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,850
It isn't finished.

823
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:01,520
You'd like it to be finished?

824
00:48:14,301 --> 00:48:18,938
<i>you'd be the first one
that I see</i>

825
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:23,809
<i>and I the last one
that you keep</i>

826
00:48:23,877 --> 00:48:27,779
<i>the dream would go on and on</i>

827
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:30,615
<i>while we sway</i>

828
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:34,719
<i>against all things
thrown our way</i>

829
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:38,023
<i>and the morning
would be so cruel</i>

830
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,191
<i>when it came</i>

831
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,164
<i>with sunshine
and warmth to bring</i>

832
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:49,668
<i>for announcing the end
of my sweet dream</i>

833
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:52,904
<i>for announcing
the end of my sweet dream.</i>
