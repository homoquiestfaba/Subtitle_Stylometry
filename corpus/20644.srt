1
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,604
The battle between Heaven
and Hell has waged eternal,

2
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,974
their armies fueled
by souls harvested on Earth.

3
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,378
The devil, Malebolgia, has sent
a lieutenant to Earth...

4
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:39,181
to recruit men to turn the
world into a place of death...

5
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,086
in exchange
for wealth and power--

6
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,921
a place that provides enough
souls to complete his army...

7
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,895
and allow Armageddon to begin.

8
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,298
All the Dark Lord needs now
is a great soldier,

9
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,667
someone who can lead his hordes
to the gates of Heaven...

10
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,672
and burn them down.

11
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:31,985
Like him,
I killed in the name of good,

12
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,855
but the violence of my life...

13
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:36,589
pulled my soul
towards the darkness.

14
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,496
But I fought and freed my soul.

15
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:45,101
Now I watch for others like me.

16
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:48,901
Men are the ones
who create evil on Earth.

17
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,806
It is
the choices they make...

18
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,311
that enslave their souls
to Hell.

19
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:56,880
This is the test.

20
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:05,693
The leader of the Algerian
Revolutionary Front...

21
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:09,163
was killed yesterday along
with 26 innocent civilians...

22
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,859
in a vicious rocket attack
in Hong Kong.

23
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,994
There has been an outpouring
of anti-U.S. sentiment...

24
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,368
sweeping across the globe.

25
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:19,203
Protesters in Libya, Bosnia,
France, Moscow...

26
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,208
and the United States...

27
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,732
are denouncing...

28
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,678
Simmons is the best.

29
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,510
Simmons is not the problem!

30
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:29,016
He's overseas
killing the bad guys...

31
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,815
Iike the hero he thinks he is.

32
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,013
We made a deal, Wynn.

33
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,215
Where the hell...

34
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,190
is the ultimate weapon
you promised?

35
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:38,624
This isn't a game we're playing.

36
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,595
Engineering a biological weapon
is an exact science.

37
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,326
You want it done right,
you do it my way.

38
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,529
This five-year plan of yours
just chaps my buttocks.

39
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,969
I'm making you a guarantee.

40
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,667
Just keep certain agencies
off my back...

41
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,609
and make damn sure I get
all that I've been promised.

42
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:59,171
If I say you're the man,
you're the man.

43
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:02,445
You do for me, in no time
you'll be running this place.

44
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:05,920
When the big pinata breaks,
you'll get it all.

45
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:08,718
Just make sure you keep
your end of the bargain.

46
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,093
P.S...

47
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,618
There's one more item
on our "to do" list.

48
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:17,461
It requires
your personal attention.

49
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,468
We need you to help recruit
a very special soldier for us.

50
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:24,199
Your all-time favorite killer,
AI Simmons.

51
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:27,606
Simmons? He's doing a great job
where he is.

52
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,167
Why do you want him?

53
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:31,679
Why do you people
always question?

54
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:35,547
Why ask "Why?"
when "How?" is so much more fun?

55
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,352
Oh...not again.

56
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,763
-Wanda, do me a favor.
-Yeah?

57
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,132
Buy your man a watch.

58
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,160
He's on his way out.
Do me a favor.

59
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:57,330
What's that?

60
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:59,306
Make sure he's back
for dinner tomorrow night.

61
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,433
I'll do my best.

62
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,636
Make sure he's back
for dinner, Terry.

63
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:03,667
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,522
Hey, Spaz.

65
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,652
Same routine, all right?

66
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:21,128
Guard the house. Guard Wanda.

67
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,064
Great guard dog.

68
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:32,733
Here.

69
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,845
Al, what happened last night?
Look at this.

70
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:41,211
What a friggin' mess.

71
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,046
We were supposed
to take out bad guys,

72
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,518
not innocent bystanders.

73
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:46,612
Another Jason Wynn special.

74
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,316
What do you mean?

75
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:51,416
An awful lot of Wynn's ops
have screwed the pooch lately.

76
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,188
Don't worry, Al. Lighten up.
I got your back.

77
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,766
Semper fi.
Good to go.

78
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,665
All right.

79
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,312
I'm going to
keep my eye on Wynn.

80
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,984
Vehicle secure.

81
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,570
The airport kill zone...

82
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,039
was supposed to be clear
of civilians.

83
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:42,066
An unfortunate
but necessary sacrifice.

84
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,910
You want someone
filling body bags, send Priest.

85
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,108
If you can't handle it,
I will.

86
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:54,385
I will send whoever
wherever I choose.

87
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,913
You will follow orders
and do your job.

88
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,448
Got a problem
with that, soldier?

89
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:03,123
Yes, I do, sir...
and I want out.

90
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,457
I always knew
you'd lose your nerve.

91
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,794
You don't quit us, son.

92
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:12,272
We are not
the U.S. Postal Service.

93
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:18,237
Have you read
your profile recently?

94
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,145
You are a borderline psychopath,

95
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,650
perfect for government service.

96
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:27,485
No guilt, no fear.
You're a killing machine.

97
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:30,754
-You're wrong about me, Wynn.
-Am l?

98
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,460
Have you
stopped to consider...

99
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,588
that you won't be happy
doing anything else?

100
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,427
I made up my mind.

101
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,763
Nothing I can say
to change it?

102
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,291
Nothing.

103
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,401
I'll arrange
for your transfer...

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,603
right after we've run
this last operation.

105
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:52,170
North Korean refinery secretly
producing biological weapons.

106
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:55,672
It's up to us
to take out the plant...

107
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:59,346
and carefully destroy
all the biochemical viruses.

108
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:03,857
Come on, son.
This is top priority.

109
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,797
Let's get it over with.

110
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:30,968
What the hell is going on here?

111
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,382
Priorities have changed, Al.

112
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,714
There's a town nearby.

113
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,720
If you release the virus,
they'll all die.

114
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:44,191
A town with approximately
8,000 experimental hosts.

115
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,250
Are you out of your damn mind?

116
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:47,989
I'm not going
to let you do this.

117
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,765
Looks like I'm up
for a promotion.

118
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,273
You wipe his ass, too?

119
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:05,442
You son of a bitch.

120
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,846
You knew what was
going on all along.

121
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:10,612
I do believe he's catching on.

122
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,991
Enjoy your retirement,
old friend.

123
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,896
Oh, and by the way,
don't worry about Wanda.

124
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,763
I'll take good care of her.

125
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,696
You touch her,
and you're a dead man.

126
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,204
You're the dead man.

127
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:44,476
See you in Hell, Al.

128
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:41,264
Aw, look who was left
in the oven too long.

129
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:45,035
I told him well-done,
not burnt.

130
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,708
I'm gonna have fun with you.

131
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,733
Hey, mister,
you don't look so good.

132
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,241
Hey, mister, you thirsty?

133
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:30,280
Get the--
Get lost, kid.

134
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,548
What are you looking at,
old man?

135
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:40,050
You tell me.

136
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:45,064
You've been gone
a long time, friend.

137
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:46,828
What are you talking about?

138
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,233
Where am l?

139
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,032
Rat city.
Part of the alley.

140
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:51,538
I sleep over there.

141
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,506
This is a holy place.
All are welcome here.

142
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:57,875
Here, Zack, here.

143
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:00,711
Yeah, right.

144
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:43,090
Don't loiter!
Let's go! Let's go!

145
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:57,370
You're welcome to join us...
if you choose.

146
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:03,867
I got a home.

147
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:20,858
A new Hellspawn has emerged
from the darkness.

148
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,556
Reborn on Earth...

149
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:26,197
drawn to the alley
by an unknown force...

150
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,998
his necroplasmic body
wracked by pain...

151
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:31,096
his memories fragmented.

152
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,165
To him, North Korea
was moments ago.

153
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:38,941
Malebolgia kept him secluded
in darkness five long years...

154
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,949
while things on Earth
changed in ways...

155
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,510
that will only feed his anger
and desire for revenge.

156
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,678
He sets out
to reclaim his humanity.

157
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:53,449
How much is left
remains to be seen.

158
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:17,813
One...

159
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,285
two...

160
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,720
three!

161
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,731
I don't have a choice.

162
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:37,203
I'll always love you...

163
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:38,796
forever.

164
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,598
Spaz.

165
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:11,071
Kids, I got more tricks
than your local hooker.

166
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,299
Here you go.

167
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,332
They say it's a trick,
but it's snot.

168
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:16,934
Little girl,
where are you going?

169
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:23,280
Want some candy?

170
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:28,010
Cyan!

171
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,418
You OK, baby?
Terry!

172
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,788
I like children...fried.

173
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,031
What's going on?

174
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,764
This man
was lying next to Cyan.

175
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:45,238
Are you OK, honey?

176
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,898
What are you doing
back here, huh?

177
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,036
What is it?

178
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,610
Beat it
before I call the cops.

179
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:53,944
Come on, get out of here.

180
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,415
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

181
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,513
Bad Crispy! Bad Crispy!

182
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,489
Clown not like.

183
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,923
Sorry for the turbulence, folks.

184
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,221
He's harmless.

185
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,194
Just a freak accident
with some Jiffy Pop.

186
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:11,027
Just get out of here
and take him.

187
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:14,501
Oh, what an adorable
little girl.

188
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,093
Can I keep her?

189
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,195
Hey.

190
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:20,298
Of course not.
No pets allowed.

191
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,536
A little something
for Lolita here?

192
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,738
Baby exorcist.

193
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,745
Come on,
my barbecued friend.

194
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,250
Don't want to keep...

195
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:32,445
that side order
of potato salad waiting.

196
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:41,127
-He knew my name.
-Are you sure?

197
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,299
Come on.
Let's get the kids inside.

198
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,101
You can't get married.

199
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,871
Wanda's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

200
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:58,037
I'm there for you, buddy.

201
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,979
This is my last mission.

202
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:01,174
Wait for me.

203
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:02,773
I just don't
want to lose you, baby.

204
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:05,911
You will never lose me.
I promise.

205
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:13,091
The master and I
are going to have words.

206
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:15,561
He knows I hate clowns.
God, I hate them.

207
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:16,961
I hate them all.

208
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,727
I hate Bozo, Ronald, Chuckles...

209
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:22,896
with their freakin' dumb noses
and their lousy party hats!

210
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,003
I don't mind being
short, fat, and ugly,

211
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,236
but the pay sucks!

212
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,817
Easy with that face.
I'm eating.

213
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,945
What does this remind you of?

214
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:41,215
No, naughty boy.

215
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:43,788
Oops. A wet one.

216
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,725
I hope I didn't
stain my underwear.

217
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:50,720
Look at that.
Skid marks.

218
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:52,824
Get away from me, you freak.

219
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,936
Coming from a monster,
that really hurts my feelings.

220
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:59,201
Come back here, scrotum-face.

221
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,401
I'm not done with you yet.

222
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:05,076
Feels like my skin
is about to explode.

223
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:09,276
That's your viral necroplasm
going through its larval stage.

224
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,244
Move over.

225
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,050
Pretty soon
you'll get hair in funny places,

226
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,953
and you'll start
thinking about girls.

227
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,355
Getting a chubby, studly?

228
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,120
A half guy, semi?

229
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:23,392
Just get me to a hospital.

230
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:24,762
A hospital?

231
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,800
Have you looked in a mirror,
burnt man walking?

232
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:33,000
Even the entire cast of "ER"
couldn't put you together again.

233
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,337
How do I put this to you?

234
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,706
You're pushing up daisies.

235
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:37,802
You're in permanent nap time.

236
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:40,905
You're fertilizer.
Is any of this sinking in?

237
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,472
You're dead.

238
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:44,711
D-e-d. Dead.

239
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,887
I guess five years
feeding earthworms...

240
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:50,948
has eaten what little brain
there was in there.

241
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:55,325
What are you?

242
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:01,001
Allow me
to kick-start your memory.

243
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,469
Hang on. These flashbacks
can be killers.

244
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:05,769
You're the dead man.

245
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:09,937
See you in Hell, Al.

246
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:37,365
This is the bargain.

247
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:42,638
If you lead my army,
you can see Wanda again.

248
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:48,704
What is your answer?

249
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,581
I will lead your army!

250
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,917
Anything for Wanda!

251
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,457
If you fail me, you will die.

252
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:07,598
Avenge your murder.
Kill Jason Wynn.

253
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:13,006
Malebolgia spent five years
preparing the Earth...

254
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,735
for your arrival, mister.

255
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,970
A little death,
a little destruction...

256
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:19,241
perfect marriage.

257
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,838
Speaking of marriage...

258
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:22,906
guess who's not
your fiancee anymore.

259
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:26,916
And the winners
are Wanda and Terry.

260
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:29,422
Multiplying like rabbits.

261
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,288
And humpin' and porkin'...

262
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:33,793
and doin' it and likin' it.

263
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,194
You stay away from her.

264
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,492
I don't want Wanda.

265
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:39,499
I want you
to take care of Wynn.

266
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,525
Then you and the army
can kick some angelic buttocks.

267
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,434
And in return
for your services,

268
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:47,668
we'll get Wanda back for you.

269
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,676
You could have
every Wanda on the planet.

270
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,644
Why settle for leftovers?

271
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,571
I love this guy.
You kill me.

272
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:57,106
Go ahead, stud.

273
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:01,754
This is all
some sadistic game of Wynn's.

274
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:04,019
And when I catch him...

275
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:06,925
he'll wish he had killed me
when he had the chance.

276
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,724
That's it!
That's the spirit.

277
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:11,061
Just think of me
as your guardian angel.

278
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:12,565
The clown from Hell.

279
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,932
You're Jimmy Stewart,
and I'm Clarence.

280
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:19,133
"Uh, well, well,
every time somebody farts,

281
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:21,437
"a demon gets his wings."

282
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:23,204
Oops, twins.

283
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,611
Get away from me,
you fudge-packing midget!

284
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:29,081
You still don't get it,
do you, Amnesia Boy?

285
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,845
We'll have to dig
a little deeper.

286
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,152
What is this?

287
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:43,220
This is where old folks
go after Florida, son.

288
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,891
What is that you say?

289
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,832
Can I dig up my body now?

290
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,427
Why, certainly.
Of course you can.

291
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,234
If you strike oil,
half of it is mine.

292
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,933
Start digging.

293
00:24:56,811 --> 00:25:00,212
Hail, Satan, lord of all
that we can see.

294
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:04,775
In the name of Luther,
Bialy, and Levinson,

295
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:07,720
I command thee to appear!

296
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:14,424
Told you we need
a bigger pentagram.

297
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:17,862
How about we get back to
that sacrifice-a-virgin idea?

298
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,200
I like that!

299
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,793
You know what I need here, man?

300
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,464
A fresh skull, man!

301
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:26,797
Yeah, you.

302
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,832
-Get away!
-Fresh!

303
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,179
Every time you go out there,

304
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:13,413
you come back
a little bit more dead inside.

305
00:26:20,394 --> 00:26:22,658
Oh, come on.
You scream like a girl.

306
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:23,856
Do it like this.

307
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,997
Someone's a little angry
'cause they died and went to--

308
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,472
Hello, my mutant,
hello, my carcass,

309
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:36,374
hello, my bug-infested corpse.

310
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,435
Did, like, Satan send you guys?

311
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:41,443
God hogs up
all the good followers,

312
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:42,972
and we get all the retards.

313
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,575
What's up with that face?

314
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,848
Get your hands off me!

315
00:26:58,365 --> 00:26:59,730
Help.

316
00:27:02,503 --> 00:27:03,663
What is that?

317
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:21,186
Shocked and amazed
at the wonders of necroflesh?

318
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:22,882
You're not alone.

319
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:24,117
For a limited time only,

320
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,854
you, too, can have
this handsome epidermis...

321
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:31,058
for the eensy price of your soul
and a buttload of pain.

322
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:33,430
-Let's get out of here!
-Oh, my God!

323
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,465
I hate weekend Satanists,
don't you?

324
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:38,334
Look at you.

325
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:44,637
From spawn larva to full-fledged
Hellspawn in record time.

326
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,514
What...is this?

327
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,411
You were tied to the tracks,

328
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,717
and that stupid train just kept
running over you, didn't it?

329
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,188
Running over you.

330
00:27:57,358 --> 00:28:00,452
In the name of the people
and things of Hell,

331
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:02,462
I dub thee...

332
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:06,091
Spawn, general of Hell's army.

333
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,964
Arise, Your Crispness!

334
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:11,096
Arise, Duke of Deep-Fried!

335
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:12,400
Sultan of Sizzling!

336
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:15,033
Emir of Ooey-Gooey!

337
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:18,135
So I suck as a clown.
Bite me.

338
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:22,638
Do your job, I'll be the first
to kiss your black butt,

339
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,344
but if you can't hack it,

340
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,580
I'll Fed Ex
your worthless carcass...

341
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,985
back to the frying pan,

342
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,217
where Malebolgia will be
waiting for us.

343
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:35,762
You'll wake up the dead.
That's you.

344
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:37,423
Dead people can still die.

345
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:41,127
All I got to do
is cut off your head.

346
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:43,530
Oh, God.

347
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:46,266
Did you have
to use the "G" word?

348
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:50,003
Wanda...

349
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:52,035
What have I done?

350
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:00,783
You done
with this Hallmark moment?

351
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,881
I can't take any more of this
sentimental crap. Come on.

352
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:08,588
I'll come back
when your armor hardens.

353
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:10,893
Don't play with it.
You'll go blind.

354
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,896
I have a few more details
to attend to,

355
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,925
and then we can play.

356
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,305
Yuck!

357
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,277
I hate anchovies.

358
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,950
That tastes so good,
I could kick some puppies!

359
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,467
This freak stuff
will come in handy...

360
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,479
when I get my hands on Wynn.

361
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:02,005
You're letting them get to you.

362
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,682
Easy, friend.

363
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:07,312
Every choice
has its consequences.

364
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:10,245
Who are you?

365
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:15,455
An assassin...like you.

366
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:19,830
I killed for the kingdom
of Saxony 500 years ago.

367
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:22,199
I am Cogliostro.

368
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:25,399
That's all you need to know...
for now.

369
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:28,340
Are there any normal people
left on Earth?

370
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,936
Or is everyone
just back from Hell?

371
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:12,311
How do you address
the accusations from some...

372
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:14,616
that the CIA
only acts to protect...

373
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:15,781
the government's
economic interests...

374
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:17,551
in the regions of conflict?

375
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:19,650
I think the government
has been attentive...

376
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:22,321
to the sensitivities
of the nations involved.

377
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:25,923
Since the unfortunate incident
in Southeast Asia last week,

378
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:28,730
Director Wynn has been meeting
with several world leaders...

379
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,532
in an attempt to quell
the proliferation...

380
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:31,731
of global conflicts.

381
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:33,433
Has this produced results?

382
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:36,442
Last week's peace summit
between Arabs and lsraelis...

383
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:39,377
was disrupted by bomb threats
from the Christian Coalition.

384
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:42,047
Fitzgerald may be
a spineless bureaucrat,

385
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:44,778
but he's doing
a great P.R. job for me.

386
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:47,013
The world is going
to Hell in a handbasket.

387
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:49,989
Thanks to him, it's just
another story on the 5:00 news.

388
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:52,423
Like lambs to the slaughter.

389
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:54,789
The best is yet to come.

390
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,434
There it is, Jess.

391
00:32:01,468 --> 00:32:03,527
Finally ready.

392
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,470
HEAT-16.

393
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:08,303
Makes the Ebola virus
look like a skin rash.

394
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:12,212
That North Korean biochemical
operation really paid off.

395
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:16,239
We harvested the ultimate weapon
from those diseased bodies,

396
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:18,911
and now we have
the only vaccine.

397
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:23,249
-Was there ever any doubt?
-Never.

398
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,850
We have weapons in place
to disperse HEAT-16...

399
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,656
over half
of this godforsaken globe.

400
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:31,493
Soon the whole world
will be at my command.

401
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:33,556
Anyone who refuses
to join my consortium...

402
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,931
won't be around to argue.

403
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,065
Time to get reacquainted,
Jason.

404
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:18,203
Director Wynn,
Terry Fitzgerald is here.

405
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:19,735
Send him in.

406
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:23,344
Speak of the devil. Come in.
Good to see you.

407
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:24,873
Director, the car
is waiting downstairs.

408
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:27,216
Good.
You know Agent Priest.

409
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:29,779
Yes. Could I have
a word with you...alone?

410
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:31,484
Of course.
Would you excuse us?

411
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:36,990
Glad you dropped by, son.

412
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,794
I want to commend you
on your handling of the media.

413
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,028
Those rumors about me
were becoming a real headache.

414
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:43,764
-Let's have a drink.
-Thank you.

415
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,840
I know we've been
covering up problems...

416
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:50,308
with our missions overseas.

417
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:52,209
I really can't keep
lying like this, sir.

418
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:55,442
Lying? Really?

419
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:57,279
I'd like to put
a team together,

420
00:33:57,317 --> 00:34:00,480
analyze the field op data,
get to the bottom of it.

421
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,647
But you're not
an analyst anymore.

422
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:05,089
There's no reason
not to take a look, sir.

423
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,356
-On the contrary.
-Beg your pardon?

424
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:13,094
Tell me...
how are Cyan and Wanda?

425
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:16,965
Little girl
just had a birthday, didn't she?

426
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:18,868
They're both fine.

427
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,372
I'm glad to hear that.

428
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:22,875
Now, let's get
something straight.

429
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,309
I run this organization
the way I see fit,

430
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:29,145
and I will do whatever is
necessary to keep it that way.

431
00:34:29,182 --> 00:34:32,310
Your job is to make damn sure
the public agrees with me.

432
00:34:32,352 --> 00:34:33,512
That clear enough?

433
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:36,115
Good.

434
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,187
The car is waiting.

435
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:37,380
Achmed and Abdullah.

436
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:39,510
Achmed, my friend.
Good to see you.

437
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:41,487
Abdullah, good to see you.

438
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,113
Up.

439
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:48,755
This one here.

440
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:49,955
Excuse us.

441
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:10,680
Excuse me, sir.
Urgent call.

442
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:11,979
Gentlemen...

443
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:14,248
Have you made a decision?

444
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:16,346
Your HEAT-16 test
was very impressive.

445
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:19,449
How do you control
delivery of the weapon?

446
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:21,688
It's the latest
in nanotechnology.

447
00:36:21,728 --> 00:36:24,959
Let me assure you,
the weapon is problem-free.

448
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:27,728
We've already placed orders
with several of our allies.

449
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:31,601
You're becoming
quite a powerful man.

450
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:34,368
Your consortium will soon rival
the United Nations.

451
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,499
Not at all, sir.

452
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,772
I'm just a facilitator.
Thank you.

453
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:40,473
My partners
are the beneficiaries.

454
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,209
To my partners, gentlemen.

455
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:47,680
-Code red security breach, sir.
-Where?

456
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,416
At the armory.
A detail's en route.

457
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:51,686
I'm on my way.
Damn it.

458
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,888
Agent Priest has arrived.

459
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:07,200
Wait here.

460
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:10,104
There's been a break-in at A-6,
the armory.

461
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:11,974
-Who?
-We don't know.

462
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,741
There's a security detail
downstairs with Priest.

463
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,008
Let's get out of here.

464
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:33,629
You!

465
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:38,297
Who are you?

466
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:42,034
What's the matter, Jason?

467
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:44,134
You don't recognize
your own handiwork?

468
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:49,973
You left me to die
in that biochem plant, remember?

469
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:51,176
Simmons!

470
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,979
You sent me to Hell!

471
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:57,216
I'm here to return the favor!

472
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:09,692
I trusted you.

473
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:11,135
Jesus.

474
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:12,729
How could you marry Wanda?

475
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:14,672
How could you?

476
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,541
Al, when you died...

477
00:38:18,645 --> 00:38:20,442
Wanda was devastated.

478
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:24,078
Do you know about Cyan?

479
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,122
Time to die, Jason.

480
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:41,363
Nice outfit, asshole.

481
00:39:01,254 --> 00:39:02,744
Damn.

482
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:06,589
What the Hell is that?

483
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,059
It's Simmons!

484
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:09,960
What are you talking about?

485
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,987
That thing is Simmons!

486
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:13,590
I want you to nail him now!

487
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,473
It's a little early
for Halloween.

488
00:39:58,511 --> 00:40:01,674
Where you're going,
every day's Halloween.

489
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:08,183
You don't have the guts.

490
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,434
You're right.

491
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:22,730
Coming, coming.

492
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,329
Will that be the same
or separate checks, lady?

493
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:29,598
Just when I was getting sick
of you whining about Wanda,

494
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:30,904
you do us proud.

495
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,777
So congrats
on your first mission.

496
00:40:33,813 --> 00:40:35,713
Go ahead.

497
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:37,046
Run!

498
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:23,957
Holy shit!

499
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:31,668
Shoot on sight.

500
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:33,899
I say again--
shoot on sight.

501
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,100
Get a light on him!

502
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:38,937
There!

503
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:00,926
-You see him?
-No, sir!

504
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:05,232
Where the hell did he go?

505
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,241
Negative, sir!

506
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:25,288
-There he is!
-All right! Take him!

507
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:12,193
What have we got here?

508
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:13,728
Gunshot wound
to the head, Doc.

509
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:16,034
Oh, she's dead.

510
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:17,064
Come on.

511
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,273
Easy.

512
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,247
Make some room here.

513
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,524
Put her around the back.

514
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,462
Why didn't you warn me
about Simmons?

515
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:45,437
Spawn was ready
sooner than I expected,

516
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,905
so don't get
your panties in a wad.

517
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,431
Always bitching at me--

518
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:50,874
"Why didn't you tell me
about Simmons?"

519
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,468
"Why didn't you tell me
it was going to hurt?"

520
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:53,911
"Am I going to go to Hell?"

521
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:56,245
Oh, grow up,
you syphilitic ball-sac.

522
00:43:56,282 --> 00:43:58,216
At least you had fun
compared to them.

523
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:01,379
Fun? Does this look
like Playland to you?

524
00:44:02,188 --> 00:44:04,520
He killed Priest!
He damn near killed me!

525
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:06,582
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

526
00:44:07,794 --> 00:44:11,560
No, Jerky.
Jerky, Spawn's a big idiot.

527
00:44:11,597 --> 00:44:13,360
Look, he's been through Hell.

528
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:18,666
As soon as he finishes
one more little detail,

529
00:44:18,705 --> 00:44:20,434
he'll be ready to join us.

530
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:21,940
I've done my part.

531
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:24,443
How about yours?
How we doing on your front?

532
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:29,041
HEAT-16 is ready to go.

533
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:30,606
It better be.

534
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,345
The army's ready.

535
00:44:32,385 --> 00:44:33,784
The Spawn's ready.

536
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,378
The HEAT-16
completes the picture.

537
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:36,786
Congrat-a-freak-a-lations.

538
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:39,485
What's Simmons got to do
with all this?

539
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:42,824
He's just the highest-scoring
killer of all time.

540
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:45,729
If we hadn't recruited him,
the other side would have.

541
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:48,165
I almost forgot again.

542
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:51,466
Memo from Brimstone Breath--

543
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:53,768
we're going to rig
a fancy-schmancy device...

544
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:56,775
that connects your heartbeat
to the HEAT-16 bomb,

545
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:00,108
so if your heart stops ticking,
the bomb goes off.

546
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:01,704
We don't want
any smart-ass fruitcake...

547
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:03,477
taking you out
ahead of schedule.

548
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:06,713
An insurance policy from Hell,
the good hands people.

549
00:45:06,753 --> 00:45:08,687
That's a good idea.
I like that.

550
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:11,781
I want your special attention
dealing with Spawn, you hear me?

551
00:45:11,824 --> 00:45:13,655
Gladly.

552
00:45:13,693 --> 00:45:14,682
Good.

553
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:15,887
Now, stay sharp.

554
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:17,190
The night is young.

555
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,492
Ladies?

556
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:22,157
Ooh, Clownie.

557
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:23,327
Ah, yes.

558
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:26,133
Have you ever ridden
a clown's pink pony?

559
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:27,639
I think it's about time.

560
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:35,209
When all the world is mine,

561
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:38,877
I will personally
fry your lard-ass.

562
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:42,747
As you've seen,

563
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:45,485
the terrible North Korean
biochemical disaster...

564
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,255
unleashed a whole host
of new diseases.

565
00:45:48,294 --> 00:45:50,353
Ten thousand people died
in the first month...

566
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:52,626
after the disaster
five years ago.

567
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:55,691
Millions have contracted
these fatal diseases--

568
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:58,169
diphtheria, cholera,
smallpox--

569
00:45:58,204 --> 00:46:00,502
diseases that had been
virtually wiped out.

570
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,532
Thought I was getting rid
of the world's vermin,

571
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:06,204
and I turn out to be
one of them.

572
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:10,880
The number of sick and dying
children continues to grow.

573
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:16,684
It's up to us to put an end...

574
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:19,384
to the suffering
of these innocent children.

575
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:20,722
Spaz!

576
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:29,934
What happened to you?

577
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:34,200
I was playing with Spaz,
and I fell down.

578
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,673
Are you all right?

579
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,302
Yeah, I'm OK.

580
00:46:39,912 --> 00:46:43,404
Wow. Your face is weird.

581
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:47,747
Cool.

582
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:49,254
What's your name?

583
00:46:51,424 --> 00:46:52,550
Spawn.

584
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:54,355
I'm Cyan.

585
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,194
You have your mother's eyes.

586
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:01,962
I knew her a long time ago.

587
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:04,492
Let's get you
back to your mother.

588
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:06,596
My, my, my.

589
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,231
What a pretty little dress.

590
00:47:08,274 --> 00:47:11,903
I wonder if she's got it
in my size?

591
00:47:12,979 --> 00:47:14,537
Spawnie, Spawnie,
he's our man.

592
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,548
If he can't kill 'em,
no one can.

593
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:18,550
Yay, Spawnie!

594
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:21,747
"S" to the "p"
to the "a" to the "awn."

595
00:47:21,787 --> 00:47:23,311
Go, Spawnie,
go, Spawnie!

596
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:28,452
You fool!

597
00:47:28,494 --> 00:47:30,724
I put you on Earth...

598
00:47:30,763 --> 00:47:34,221
to make sure Spawn keeps
his end of the bargain.

599
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:36,895
Why'd you pick him
to lead the army anyway?

600
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:37,903
What are you thinking?

601
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:39,700
It should be me.

602
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,536
I had the tenure.

603
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:44,975
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

604
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,241
And that's exactly
the kind of talk...

605
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,908
we don't tolerate
around here, right, boss?

606
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:51,439
Enough!

607
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:53,213
Spawn must choose...

608
00:47:53,252 --> 00:47:56,744
to murder Wynn
and release the virus.

609
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:00,987
Then my army will be complete.

610
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:02,358
Now, now, boss...

611
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:05,091
This is your last chance.

612
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:07,493
Thank you.

613
00:48:10,703 --> 00:48:13,570
Excuse me.
Cyan!

614
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,408
Honey, didn't I tell you
not to leave my sight?

615
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:22,210
I was playing with Spaz,
and I fell down,

616
00:48:22,248 --> 00:48:24,739
and Spawn came and helped me.

617
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:27,048
You're not supposed to talk
to strangers, either.

618
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,054
Spawn's not a stranger, Mommy.

619
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:35,455
-We're going home right now.
-What's going on?

620
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:38,587
-What is going on?
-I'll explain later.

621
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:39,757
No, explain now.

622
00:48:39,799 --> 00:48:42,597
I'm not going through
this again. No secrets.

623
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:44,466
Wynn was attacked
at the reception.

624
00:48:44,503 --> 00:48:46,903
I don't want
to take any chances.

625
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:50,068
Trust me.

626
00:49:05,424 --> 00:49:06,914
Go home.

627
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,095
Fix your seat belt, honey.

628
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:15,124
What the hell is going on?

629
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:17,761
Daddy, what about Spaz?

630
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,368
Spaz?

631
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,373
Go home, Spaz.

632
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,782
He knows the way back home
better than we do.

633
00:49:37,923 --> 00:49:39,117
Let's go, Terry.

634
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:52,470
You don't want to be
where I'm going.

635
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:59,472
But it's your funeral.

636
00:50:19,265 --> 00:50:21,028
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

637
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:23,160
Puking up decent food, boy?

638
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,362
It's rotten.

639
00:50:26,138 --> 00:50:29,835
You think we eat so good you can
just spit up what you like?

640
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:33,104
Don't talk back to me.

641
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:41,343
Eat this!

642
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:52,628
No, don't!
He's my dad.

643
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:07,002
Keep away from him.

644
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:12,243
B.P. and heart rate?

645
00:51:12,284 --> 00:51:15,082
One-thirty-four over 77,
heart rate, 60.

646
00:51:15,121 --> 00:51:17,715
Let's increase the flow
to 3.5.

647
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:22,060
We're ready for the monitor.

648
00:51:25,598 --> 00:51:27,498
I'll make a small incision...

649
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:30,263
so that we can insert
this heart monitor.

650
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:32,395
You'll feel a slight pinch.

651
00:52:03,402 --> 00:52:06,769
Awesome hardware.
What will you do with it?

652
00:52:06,806 --> 00:52:09,206
Throw someone
a going-away party.

653
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:12,133
Need any help?

654
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:15,037
Listen, kid...

655
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,071
I'm not looking
to make friends.

656
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:28,749
-What's your name?
-Zack.

657
00:52:28,794 --> 00:52:31,558
I'm Al.

658
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:33,087
That's Spaz.

659
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:43,701
Breathe normally, Director.

660
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:50,515
The system is now operational.

661
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:52,744
As per your orders,
Director Wynn,

662
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:55,948
if your vital signs flatline
for any reason,

663
00:52:55,988 --> 00:52:59,822
the device will uplink
and detonate the HEAT-16 bombs.

664
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,259
No one would dare kill you.

665
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:04,592
Good work, Doc.

666
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:08,830
What a double cross.

667
00:53:08,868 --> 00:53:12,804
I got Wynn to kill Spawn
and create the HEAT-16 bomb.

668
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,205
Now I get Spawn to murder Wynn
and release the virus.

669
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:19,567
If all goes well,
it should hurt like hell.

670
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,510
I can't believe I actually
got Wynn to get operated.

671
00:53:25,551 --> 00:53:26,745
What a maroon.

672
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:29,447
It's going to send Earth
into a tailspin...

673
00:53:29,488 --> 00:53:31,683
of death and destruction.

674
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:43,730
It's time.

675
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:52,470
Sometimes I wake up at night
down in the alley and wonder...

676
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:54,979
Is this Hell?

677
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,777
Not yet...

678
00:53:56,815 --> 00:53:58,282
but soon.

679
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:01,310
Heads up.

680
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:03,582
Got one.

681
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,320
Who's your new friend, Spawn?

682
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,259
-Get out of here, Zack.
-But--

683
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:10,557
-Go!

684
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:19,231
Miss me?

685
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:22,700
Here's Clownie!

686
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,907
It was you who told Wynn
to kill me.

687
00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:30,848
Guilty as charged.

688
00:54:30,883 --> 00:54:33,215
Before I blow
your fat circus ass away,

689
00:54:33,252 --> 00:54:35,812
tell me why you picked me
to lead your war.

690
00:54:35,854 --> 00:54:39,847
If it isn't Curious Crispy.

691
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,359
The evil's been there...

692
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:44,226
since you were soup
in your mama's crotch.

693
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:48,461
Your DNA spelled DOA,
and we just nursed it along.

694
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,596
Those assassin missions were
just training for what's coming.

695
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:55,698
Let's get down to business.

696
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,938
Wynn's finally got
that HEAT-16 virus bomb working.

697
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:00,445
Made especially for you.

698
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:02,743
Get things started with
a big, wet, infectious...

699
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,349
All you have to do is just
lead us to the holy land,

700
00:55:09,388 --> 00:55:11,686
so we can burn it down.

701
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:16,820
You filthy
little piece of vermin.

702
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:20,025
What makes you think
I would join your army?

703
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:22,727
You can take your army
and shove it.

704
00:55:22,768 --> 00:55:25,760
Sounds like a country song--
"Take your army and shove it."

705
00:55:25,804 --> 00:55:28,932
You've got that "l want to beat
the fat little man"...

706
00:55:28,974 --> 00:55:30,441
Iook in your eye.

707
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:37,580
I'm going to cut you
into 50 pieces...

708
00:55:37,616 --> 00:55:39,675
and mail you to every state.

709
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:41,948
I'll take your intestines and--

710
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,450
I don't know how you put up
with this crap.

711
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:50,929
You're a bigger fool
than I thought...

712
00:55:50,963 --> 00:55:53,431
if you think you're going
to wreck my plans.

713
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:55,228
You'll do what you promised.

714
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:57,599
Put down my dog.

715
00:55:57,636 --> 00:55:59,729
Nice doggie.

716
00:55:59,772 --> 00:56:02,002
Heel, fetch...

717
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,565
No, I got it.

718
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:06,640
Play dead!

719
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:17,746
You want to do it the hard way?

720
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,417
I warned you.

721
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:23,121
I'll just
have to teach you a lesson.

722
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:25,756
No more clowning around.

723
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:27,629
I'm not the vindicator...

724
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,634
or the victimizer...

725
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:32,501
or the vaporizer
or the vibrator.

726
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:35,304
I'm...

727
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,706
the violator!

728
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:41,671
Good Lord!

729
00:57:47,379 --> 00:57:48,471
I ain't staying!

730
00:58:48,774 --> 00:58:50,537
Damn alley ain't safe no more!

731
00:59:00,886 --> 00:59:02,285
We're going.

732
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:22,433
Violator, one,
Spawnie-boy, zero.

733
01:00:28,573 --> 01:00:31,838
You've been violated,
girlie-man, huh?

734
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:34,175
I could have killed you
like that.

735
01:00:34,212 --> 01:00:37,113
Is that a little more surprise
than you wanted?

736
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:41,848
Twinkle, twinkle,
little Spawn.

737
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,252
You look like crap.

738
01:00:43,288 --> 01:00:45,256
Go fertilize my lawn.

739
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:48,384
You're not excited yet?

740
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:51,396
Helter-skelter's coming down
with or without you.

741
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,261
Either you lead the army,

742
01:00:53,298 --> 01:00:56,131
or Wynn plays
pin-the-tail on Wanda.

743
01:00:56,168 --> 01:00:59,695
"Hey, Wanda, come on,
give me that sweet stuff."

744
01:00:59,738 --> 01:01:03,196
"Oh, no. Oh, please,
Wynn, don't.

745
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:06,074
"Somebody help me."

746
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:08,238
Forget Terry.

747
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,512
It's my turn to ride
the Wanda carousel of love.

748
01:01:13,852 --> 01:01:16,719
Stay away from her.

749
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:19,417
Your choice.

750
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,891
See you at Wanda's.

751
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:23,190
Last one there
gets her rotten eggs.

752
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:29,325
Wynn and Wanda
sitting in a tree,

753
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:32,462
s-u-c-k-i-n-g.

754
01:01:32,504 --> 01:01:34,301
First comes love...

755
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:39,208
The truth
has taken its toll on you.

756
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:42,805
I'm going to kill
that asshole.

757
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:45,544
You still haven't learned.

758
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,972
Clearance granted.

759
01:02:19,718 --> 01:02:22,380
Downloading secure files.

760
01:02:31,396 --> 01:02:33,125
Gotcha, Jason.

761
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:37,933
I can't afford to be wrong.

762
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:48,773
Still with us, I see.

763
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:08,096
Your vengeance...

764
01:03:08,133 --> 01:03:09,566
their pain.

765
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:12,399
Wynn, Wanda--
none of this is worth the cost.

766
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:18,002
Those are the only things
that matter to me now.

767
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:19,874
AI Simmons is dead.

768
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:21,776
Let him go.

769
01:03:21,813 --> 01:03:24,213
I am Simmons, old man.

770
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:31,112
You're Spawn now,

771
01:03:31,156 --> 01:03:34,057
but that doesn't mean
you have to be what they want.

772
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:46,694
You're still
letting them get to you.

773
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:48,501
Your anger is your weakness.

774
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,907
They'll use it to rob you
of any humanity you have left.

775
01:03:51,943 --> 01:03:53,911
AI Simmons knew that violence...

776
01:03:53,945 --> 01:03:56,607
only makes for
more pain and suffering.

777
01:03:56,648 --> 01:03:58,513
He tried to leave off killing,

778
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,347
give himself a second chance.

779
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:04,513
Your old life is gone.
Accept that.

780
01:04:06,992 --> 01:04:08,892
I still love Wanda.

781
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:11,088
Put her in the past.

782
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:13,359
It's the only way
you can be free.

783
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:15,559
She's the only reason
I'm here.

784
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:22,066
The war between
Heaven and Hell...

785
01:04:22,107 --> 01:04:24,473
depends on the choices we make,

786
01:04:24,509 --> 01:04:27,535
and those choices
require sacrifice.

787
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:29,046
That's the test.

788
01:04:36,955 --> 01:04:39,515
I didn't know
this was going to happen.

789
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,189
I'm going to nail that scumbag.

790
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:02,370
Kiss it good-bye, Clown.

791
01:05:02,414 --> 01:05:05,679
This is just what they want.
You're playing their game.

792
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:08,482
Then I'll play dirty.

793
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,978
-Guns are useless.
-You got a better idea?

794
01:05:27,205 --> 01:05:28,502
I might.

795
01:05:33,678 --> 01:05:37,341
You've been using
your armor only by reflex.

796
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:39,316
You must learn to control it.

797
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:41,546
It has trillions
of neuroconnections.

798
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:44,680
They're a living extension
of your own instincts,

799
01:05:44,723 --> 01:05:47,624
instantly translating
your thought...

800
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:49,923
into physical reality,

801
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:53,124
so long as you stay
clear and focused.

802
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:57,526
So...that's how it works.

803
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:08,869
-Cool!
-Now try your chains.

804
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,312
You must visualize
your objective.

805
01:06:18,356 --> 01:06:20,017
The armor does the rest.

806
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:21,582
All right, Yoda. Wait.

807
01:06:23,962 --> 01:06:25,054
You ready?

808
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:28,159
All right, go!

809
01:06:36,241 --> 01:06:37,538
Not bad.

810
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:40,568
Don't get cocky.

811
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:42,705
You've a lot more to learn.

812
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:45,215
Your cape has its own powers.

813
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,150
I have to get to Wanda's.

814
01:06:51,723 --> 01:06:53,554
Take care of your powers.

815
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:56,424
When you drain them,
you die.

816
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:58,053
Won't be needing these.

817
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,156
You're catching on.

818
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,199
Or this.

819
01:07:13,011 --> 01:07:15,479
I want you to return Spaz to me.

820
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:17,879
No matter how you find him.
Understand?

821
01:07:27,058 --> 01:07:29,026
Now...

822
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,687
the final test.

823
01:07:42,574 --> 01:07:43,973
Get out of my way!

824
01:07:47,712 --> 01:07:49,680
I'll get Spawn so worked up,

825
01:07:49,714 --> 01:07:51,545
he'll kill Wynn
without blinking.

826
01:07:55,253 --> 01:07:56,550
When I'm done with you,

827
01:07:56,588 --> 01:07:58,317
they'll change your name
to "Stain."

828
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:10,993
Look, Ma, no hands!

829
01:08:30,488 --> 01:08:31,955
I love the smell...

830
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:34,254
of burning asphalt
in the morning!

831
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:44,298
Send a boy to do a clown's job?

832
01:08:47,071 --> 01:08:50,438
It's an honor to be
a Hellspawn, you hear me?

833
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:02,344
That's not fair!

834
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,951
Time for some necro-goo!

835
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:13,727
Open wide and say "Aah!"

836
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:57,664
See you at Wanda's!

837
01:10:30,975 --> 01:10:33,603
Reading secure files.

838
01:10:38,516 --> 01:10:40,609
Christ.

839
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:43,018
Wynn is out of his mind.

840
01:11:07,378 --> 01:11:09,209
I'm thirsty.

841
01:11:11,816 --> 01:11:14,216
OK, baby.

842
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:16,846
You want some water?

843
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:19,890
Establishing connection.

844
01:11:21,092 --> 01:11:22,753
What have you got?

845
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:26,252
Black bag ops,
assassination lists, everything.

846
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:28,731
Wynn's been using A-6
to run a criminal consortium.

847
01:11:28,766 --> 01:11:32,258
He's got some biological weapon
called HEAT-16.

848
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:33,531
It's all there?

849
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:35,402
I want to get it
on tonight's news.

850
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,408
I'm e-mailing you a copy.

851
01:11:37,442 --> 01:11:40,070
It should be enough
to bury Wynn.

852
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:41,601
Great.

853
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,175
Daddy?

854
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:48,310
Hey, sweetheart.

855
01:11:53,758 --> 01:11:55,749
What are you doing here?

856
01:11:57,795 --> 01:11:59,524
Some unfinished business.

857
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:05,697
You disappoint me, Terry.

858
01:12:14,012 --> 01:12:15,639
You can't release the virus.

859
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,409
Millions of people will die.

860
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:19,882
Only those
who refuse to join me.

861
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:28,125
You're a very lucky man.

862
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:34,488
Whatever it is you want,
just take it and go.

863
01:12:34,532 --> 01:12:36,295
I intend to.

864
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:42,503
Let's go.

865
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:47,639
On the floor.

866
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:51,809
The kid stays with me.
Answer the door.

867
01:12:54,052 --> 01:12:55,542
Go on.

868
01:12:56,721 --> 01:12:59,155
It's all right, sweetheart.

869
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:05,753
Peek-a-boo.

870
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:07,788
I see you.

871
01:13:09,734 --> 01:13:12,635
This place
is hard to find in the dark.

872
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,195
I smell you're not
wearing any panties.

873
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:20,505
Hello, Cyan. Remember me?

874
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:26,615
You were at my birthday party.

875
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:28,676
No duh.

876
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,881
What are you,
a regular Einstein?

877
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:32,856
You sure know
how to raise them.

878
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:34,323
Don't you touch her.

879
01:13:35,326 --> 01:13:36,588
Back off, hero.

880
01:13:36,627 --> 01:13:39,858
I'm back by popular demand.

881
01:13:39,897 --> 01:13:42,297
Big as life and twice as rotten.

882
01:13:52,376 --> 01:13:54,344
Does wonders for my asthma.

883
01:13:55,313 --> 01:13:57,076
Where's Spawn?

884
01:13:57,115 --> 01:13:58,810
Let's cut the crap.

885
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:01,876
Spawn's on his way.
You ready to play?

886
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:03,648
Of course I am.

887
01:14:03,688 --> 01:14:05,622
You better be.

888
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:13,528
You don't know how much
your heart means to me.

889
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:19,837
Bring 'em, Jerky.

890
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:21,202
Come on.

891
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:53,530
Help me, please.

892
01:14:54,806 --> 01:14:56,000
Careful.

893
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,168
Don't make me nervous.
I might nick something vital.

894
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,236
-Get away from her.
-I can't do that.

895
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,339
She wants me.

896
01:15:04,382 --> 01:15:07,112
You touch her,
and you die slow.

897
01:15:07,151 --> 01:15:08,550
All right, Spawn.

898
01:15:08,586 --> 01:15:10,247
No more fun and games.

899
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:13,519
Either you join Hell's army,
or she dies...

900
01:15:13,558 --> 01:15:15,492
after I'm done.

901
01:15:15,526 --> 01:15:18,086
I will rip your heart out!
Let her go.

902
01:15:18,129 --> 01:15:20,029
So what's it gonna be?

903
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:23,261
Time's running out.

904
01:15:27,805 --> 01:15:29,238
Too late.

905
01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:55,992
It's all your fault, Spawn.

906
01:15:56,033 --> 01:15:58,968
She was doing fine
till you showed up.

907
01:15:59,003 --> 01:16:01,733
Now you've got nothing
left to lose.

908
01:16:01,772 --> 01:16:04,741
You're a soulless corpse!

909
01:16:04,775 --> 01:16:06,106
Nothing!

910
01:16:07,778 --> 01:16:09,302
You're wrong.

911
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:15,009
I've still got you.

912
01:16:26,797 --> 01:16:28,389
Don't be afraid.

913
01:16:33,137 --> 01:16:36,004
-You can't kill me.
-Is that right?

914
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,440
If my heart stops,
the virus is released,

915
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:40,034
and everybody
in the world dies.

916
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:42,443
Like you said...

917
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,710
I've got nothing else to lose.

918
01:16:55,927 --> 01:16:58,418
That's right.
Feel the burn.

919
01:16:58,462 --> 01:17:00,794
Get used to it.
It's payback time.

920
01:17:00,831 --> 01:17:03,163
See you in Hell, Jason.

921
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:13,842
If you kill me, you kill her!

922
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:50,472
I'm through
doing Hell's dirty work.

923
01:18:03,494 --> 01:18:06,156
You worthless bag of...

924
01:18:07,498 --> 01:18:10,092
How could you let him kill me?

925
01:18:10,134 --> 01:18:14,161
The most important thing in your
entire freakin' universe!

926
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:20,474
Whatever happened to love,
honor, respect?

927
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:23,708
You pansy bacon-crisp!

928
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,711
You should have killed him!

929
01:18:31,756 --> 01:18:34,725
Popped his head like a zit.

930
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:38,657
It feels...so good.

931
01:18:38,696 --> 01:18:42,029
And feel that butt.
It feels so...hairy.

932
01:18:46,203 --> 01:18:47,693
Joke's over.

933
01:18:47,738 --> 01:18:50,673
You should have killed Jason
when you had the chance.

934
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:51,834
Never.

935
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:54,310
What do you mean never?
Never?

936
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,346
Do you know how hard
I've been working on this?

937
01:18:58,382 --> 01:19:01,408
You set me up,
you malignant sow!

938
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,917
What do you think you got
the pacemaker for?

939
01:19:05,956 --> 01:19:07,548
Your perfect
attendance record,

940
01:19:07,591 --> 01:19:09,650
you spoon-sucking dipstick?

941
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:11,661
I was counting on
Spawn killing you.

942
01:19:11,695 --> 01:19:13,287
Then you would get his soul...

943
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,696
and kick-start
the apocalypse now.

944
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:19,225
I say destroy the cosmos,
ask questions later.

945
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,067
But first...

946
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:24,734
first, I want to slaughter
each and every one of you.

947
01:19:26,277 --> 01:19:30,646
And then I'm gonna have a little
creme de Wanda.

948
01:19:33,384 --> 01:19:35,614
I'll let you watch, too.

949
01:19:38,756 --> 01:19:40,121
Yummy yum.

950
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:49,494
Tastes like chicken.

951
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:54,961
Cogliostro!

952
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:57,030
Come and get me!

953
01:20:09,386 --> 01:20:10,876
He'll be back.

954
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:14,080
Concentrate on healing.

955
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:16,116
Come on!

956
01:20:20,631 --> 01:20:23,600
I may not be able
to hold him off alone.

957
01:20:27,338 --> 01:20:31,798
Come on down to my world
and die, suckers!

958
01:20:55,799 --> 01:20:58,199
All right,
you overgrown gecko...

959
01:20:59,236 --> 01:21:01,704
Come and get your throat cut.

960
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:56,349
If you won't lead my army,

961
01:22:56,387 --> 01:22:59,288
then you must die.

962
01:23:02,293 --> 01:23:04,261
Never!

963
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:06,820
Bring me Spawn's head.

964
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:42,692
You will never escape me.

965
01:24:06,557 --> 01:24:08,149
It's all right now, baby.

966
01:24:14,465 --> 01:24:15,523
Come on.

967
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:27,707
They belong together.

968
01:24:27,745 --> 01:24:30,339
There's no place for me here.

969
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,940
Maybe you're the one
after all.

970
01:24:36,353 --> 01:24:39,880
You were checking me out
from the start, weren't you?

971
01:24:40,891 --> 01:24:42,324
I'm too old for this.

972
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:44,759
Not as quick as I used to be.

973
01:24:44,795 --> 01:24:46,922
I've fought this war
long enough.

974
01:24:46,964 --> 01:24:48,898
It's time for someone
to take over.

975
01:24:48,932 --> 01:24:51,162
What if I sided with Clown?

976
01:24:52,803 --> 01:24:54,293
I'd have killed you.

977
01:24:57,307 --> 01:24:58,535
Right.

978
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:10,147
-I followed him here.
-Thanks, kid.

979
01:25:59,102 --> 01:26:01,036
Use your armor!

980
01:26:05,909 --> 01:26:07,536
Concentrate!

981
01:26:10,614 --> 01:26:12,172
Bite this!

982
01:26:17,654 --> 01:26:19,781
Cut off his head!

983
01:26:36,707 --> 01:26:38,470
You'll pay for this.

984
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,301
It's not over yet.

985
01:26:42,346 --> 01:26:44,314
I'll gum you to death.

986
01:26:44,348 --> 01:26:46,316
I'll bite you.

987
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:50,147
Wanda, what do you think
about a little head?

988
01:26:53,924 --> 01:26:55,892
This is your last chance
to join up.

989
01:26:55,926 --> 01:26:57,393
Think about it.

990
01:26:57,427 --> 01:26:58,416
Come on.

991
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,325
You'll pay for this.

992
01:27:05,369 --> 01:27:08,065
Give my regards to your boss.

993
01:27:08,105 --> 01:27:09,970
Tell him he's next.

994
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:22,041
I'm gonna die!

995
01:27:22,085 --> 01:27:24,178
Not bad for a dead man.

996
01:27:26,056 --> 01:27:27,546
Beginner's luck.

997
01:27:31,528 --> 01:27:33,519
Come on, folks.
Let's move back, please.

998
01:27:33,564 --> 01:27:36,533
Is it true the documents
you've uncovered...

999
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:38,034
implicate Jason Wynn?

1000
01:27:38,068 --> 01:27:41,799
Yes. For the past five years,
I unwittingly participated...

1001
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:44,102
in Jason Wynn's illegal
manipulation of the A-6...

1002
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:46,837
to further his ambitions
for worldwide power.

1003
01:27:46,877 --> 01:27:49,345
What took you
so long to respond?

1004
01:27:49,379 --> 01:27:51,847
Are the HEAT-16 bombs
still a danger?

1005
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:55,079
The entire HEAT-16 weapon system
has already been destroyed.

1006
01:27:57,087 --> 01:27:58,816
Do you have
any further comments?

1007
01:27:58,855 --> 01:28:01,346
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

1008
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:03,552
The documents I release
to all media outlets...

1009
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:05,562
will answer the rest
of your questions.

1010
01:28:05,596 --> 01:28:08,087
Thank you.
Natalie Ford reporting live.

1011
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:47,736
Spawn has stopped...

1012
01:28:47,771 --> 01:28:51,332
Malebolgia's plans
to destroy the Earth.

1013
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:53,866
The choice has been made.

1014
01:28:55,712 --> 01:28:57,373
For now.
