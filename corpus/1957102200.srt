I am, but if you say
you're not drinking,

pressing on your brain.

to protect the reputation

whose aspirations

would be severely compromised

be further from the truth,

I haven't the foggiest

reasons for wishing

to communicate
with the departed,

885
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,602

considered the possibility

wished to get in
touch with the spirit

892
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:59,437

I would have of course

893

consulted you first.

getting in touch with her.

I can assure you.

897
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,797
