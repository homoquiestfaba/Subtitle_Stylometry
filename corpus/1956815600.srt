1
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,464
Geez, how late is Fotomat open?

2
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,304
I do wanna thank you all
for your patience.

3
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,140
We are now obviously
ready to go.

4
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,574
I'm Howard Stringer,

5
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:43,111
and as president
of CBS Entertainment,

6
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:46,614
it is my singular pleasure,
and a great moment for us,

7
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,650
to be able to bring
this great star to CBS,

8
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,419
David Letterman!

9
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,156
I never dated Amy Fisher!

10
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,126
I fixed her car,
I helped her with her homework,

11
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,129
and, that's all,
alright, thank you.

12
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,164
Alright, I'll
take some questions,

13
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,366
and, then, Colin Powell
will be in here,

14
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,767
and update you
on the bombing.

15
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:12,406
I do wanna thank CBS
for their support,

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,243
and, of course,
for their generosity,

17
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,345
I mean, wow, this is a deal

18
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,347
that would put a smile
on Jack Benny's face,

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,384
and that's in the condition
he's in right now!

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,653
Does G.E. make the best managers
for a television network?

21
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,428
What was the question?

22
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,697
Oh, yeah, no, you know,
I don't know about that,

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,334
but, they make
a darn fine toaster oven.

24
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,843
C'mon, Paul,
we gotta do a show.

25
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,946
Dave, I have a terrible
case of the hiccups.

26
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,715
You tried holding your breath?
Everything.

27
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,417
I got an idea,
hold on.

28
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:31,919
What are you doing?

29
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,921
Just put that
on your head there,

30
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,489
breathe normally,
there, Paul.

31
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,458
Okay.

32
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,859
I'm breathin'.

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,466
How was that,
you feel any better?

34
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,439
Oh, gosh.

35
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,774
Sorry...

36
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,909
Must've been
something I ate.

37
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,514
It's bloody marvelous.

38
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,784
The Tonight Show,
Johnny's guest host tonight is,

39
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,253
Jay Leno!

40
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,454
Ladies and gentlemen,

41
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,322
Jay-y-y Leno!

42
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,464
Thank you!

43
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:17,865
Thank you!

44
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,533
Wonderful, wonderful,
that's nice to hear,

45
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,968
Now, did you all
see in the paper,

46
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,936
there's a survey that says
that you're safer,

47
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,573
and, now this is true,
you're safer,

48
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,975
on an airplane than you are
in your own bathroom.

49
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,511
Do you believe that?
Do you think that's true?

50
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,646
I don't know, I've never
slipped on the toilet seat

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,882
and fallen 35,000 feet!

52
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,786
I mean, I never
adjusted the shower rod,

53
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,755
and had a fire ball
come out and incinerate me.

54
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,295
So, why can't we just throw
money at one of them?

55
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,829
What sort of offer
do you have in mind?

56
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,564
What does it matter?

57
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,901
"Late Night's" making
$70 million a year for NBC.

58
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,569
Where's our bloody piece?

59
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,405
That would have been Mr. Sajak.

60
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,274
Oh, Christ, what a disaster.

61
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,842
He's got a lock on every
blue-haired old biddy

62
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,043
who ever watched
"Wheel of Fortune."

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,645
Do you know how many
of our stations

64
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,280
are canceling him for Arsenio?

65
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,549
It's like they're
canceling him before we can.

66
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,720
Look at these fucking numbers
when Leno fills in for Carson.

67
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,388
And Letterman.

68
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,757
NBC has him signed through '93.

69
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,593
Well, what about Leno?

70
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,795
NBC only has a one-year
holding deal with Jay.

71
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,731
That's nothing. He could be ripe.

72
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,734
So let's steal him!

73
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,037
We can give him a show now,
for christsakes.

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,374
I'll push Sajak over a cliff
if we can get Leno.

75
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,608
They might fight for him.

76
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,410
Let them.

77
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,946
They can't fight equally
for Leno and Letterman.

78
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,316
They're not gonna offer both
Carson's spot when he retires.

79
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,017
This is the best opportunity
we've ever had

80
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,688
to break NBC's
strangle-hold on late night.

81
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,490
Okay, Howard.

82
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,058
Let's go stir something up.

83
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,993
And, you know,
we can knock it out

84
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,762
in one fell swoop.

85
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,097
Oh!

86
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,501
Oh, bouncy up here!

87
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,636
We gotta do a commercial here,
boys and girls.

88
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,373
We'll be right back
with more Sandra Bernhard.

89
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,011
I'm havin' a blast.

90
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,680
Thanks for havin' me back on Dave.

91
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,415
How you doin'?

92
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,019
What do you want the number
of my therapist?

93
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,524
You should be thrilled
with your life.

94
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,730
It wasn't that bad, Dave.

95
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,365
Okay, we had a little trouble
with the first bit,

96
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,066
but Sandra was good,
and you were good with her.

97
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,802
I sucked, Morty,

98
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,004
and the whole show sucked
because I sucked.

99
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,939
I don't belong on
network television.

100
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,941
I belong in Muncie, driving gravel.

101
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,443
You got great laughs.

102
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,378
Oh, bullshit, if that
audience was any deader,

103
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:45,579
there'd be guys in lab coats

104
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,948
going through harvesting organs.

105
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,884
Those dorks at NBC probably
steered in the crowd

106
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,820
waiting in line for Donahue
by mistake.

107
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,121
It's their way of
sending a message.

108
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,557
- What message?
- Oh, come on. <i>The</i> message.

109
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,859
Like giving Jay the job as permanent
guest host for Johnny.

110
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,093
They didn't make him guest
host to mess with you.

111
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,029
They do everything to mess with me.

112
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,165
What do you call renting out our studio
in the morning to Maury Povich, for chri---

113
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,067
- Laurie, I need some coffee.
- Great show.

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,636
Yeah.

115
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,472
I mean, when are we
supposed to rehearse?

116
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,474
Am I supposed to move my camera
around a bunch of bald women

117
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,175
with eating disorders?

118
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,077
We won't let that happen, Dave.
We'll do something about it.

119
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,480
Gosh, Morty, I know,
we could boycott the show.

120
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,782
They'll probably use that
as an excuse to fire me.

121
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,684
Oh, come on, Dave.

122
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,885
I fucked up number six--

123
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,554
No, you didn't.

124
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,155
It was the only decent joke
in the whole fucking show--

125
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,823
it was funny!

126
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,025
It was funny, I wasn't.
Let me see the tape.

127
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,427
Take a breather!

128
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:34,695
Give me the fuckin' tape.

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,201
Oh, man,

130
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,004
oh, for Chrissake's!

131
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,006
Jesus, do I suck!

132
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,576
Oh, that's good,

133
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,143
I should've jumped in right there!

134
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,582
Listen, you cheap, fuckin' bastard,

135
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,550
it's one lousy table, $10,000!

136
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,751
That's chump change!

137
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,687
That's extortion, Helen.

138
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,221
What? That's not extortion.
It's charity, for God's sake.

139
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,223
It's for pediatric AIDS.

140
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,958
You selfish prick!

141
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,495
Don't flatter me!
Put me down for two.

142
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,196
What? Two tables.

143
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,765
You are such a mensch!

144
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,767
Yes, I still love you.

145
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,536
See, that didn't hurt very bad.

146
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,737
So, we can have dinner, honey.

147
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,238
I gotta go.

148
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,673
I gotta go. Jay's here.

149
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,208
Bye.

150
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,913
- How ya doin'?
- Here's your tickets.

151
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,581
Where am I going this time?

152
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:30,217
Come, I'll walk you to the car.

153
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,085
That's mine.

154
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,487
I gotta know my future.

155
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,155
I know your future. Follow me!

156
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,958
You're playing "Joe Laffs"
in Green Bay, Friday.

157
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,193
The NBC affiliate is W.L.U.K.

158
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,995
Good luck, huh?

159
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,197
I'm getting you in just in time
to do the noon news.

160
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,233
That's good, I'm sure
there's a lot of people

161
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,901
watching the noon news in Green Bay.

162
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,603
Don't give me shit.

163
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,204
Those local stations are gonna
get you "The Tonight Show."

164
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,040
Here, I wanna show you
somethin'. Look at this.

165
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,909
Oh, please. Not another goddamn
motorcycle. I don't have time.

166
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,177
Helen, hold on.

167
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,179
Take a second and look at this motorcycle.

168
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,114
"To J.L.,

169
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,518
crank it on up, and
ride over to CBS forever."

170
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,654
It's a rare bike. Do you have
any idea what this cost them?

171
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,221
No. I don't know what it cost,

172
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,723
but I know what it means.

173
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,597
- Hi.
- Hello.

174
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,533
- Table for two?
- Please.

175
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,769
Are you sure this is
the place for a good
corned beef sandwich?

176
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,936
Yeah.

177
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,107
She wanted discreet.

178
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,910
I don't think anybody
from NBC will be dropping--

179
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,111
Oh, Jesus.

180
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,713
What?

181
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,147
Arnie Kleiner from Paramount,

182
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,616
just walked in with some other guy.

183
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,253
Will they know Helen?

184
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,022
Here she comes.

185
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,826
You said we'd have privacy here.

186
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,796
I just saw Arnie Kleiner in
the corner downing a Thai beer.

187
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,831
Oh, my God, Howard Stringer.

188
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,933
Right. A pleasure to meet you, Helen.

189
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,769
Rod said we'd just talk
a little business over lunch.

190
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,337
This looks like a
little more than lunch.

191
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,972
Of course it is.

192
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,642
We wouldn't wanna waste
your valued time.

193
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,243
Alright...

194
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,246
Now, we think the world of Jay.

195
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,649
We've noticed what he's been
doing filling in for Carson,

196
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,351
and we think he's ready
to be a star. Right now.

197
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,155
And, we have something
no one else can offer him.

198
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,124
11:30, wide open.

199
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,293
Holy shit.

200
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,696
A deal memo already?

201
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,132
You guys are serious.

202
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,936
Here, you take this.
I don't wanna hold on to this.

203
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,171
You can give Jay the details
without the paper if you prefer.

204
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,142
The show opens in September.
He'll get six million to start.

205
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,810
How does that sound?

206
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,345
Six million?

207
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,814
Yeah, alright. I'm impressed.

208
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,850
But, uh, we may be
rushing this a little bit.

209
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,619
Jay's a loyal puppy. He's got a
thing for "The Tonight Show,"

210
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,254
like every other comic in America.

211
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,922
Of course.

212
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,223
But, isn't he still
third in that line,

213
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,659
behind Carson and Letterman?

214
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,193
No, I wouldn't say that.

215
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,028
But, I would say
that we have some reason

216
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,631
to feel a little impatient
with where we are.

217
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,667
And I'll admit it to you, Howard,

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,368
I love this offer.

219
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,370
I'm sure you do, Helen.

220
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,075
Compliments of Mr. Kleiner.

221
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,166
This feels like the Late Night DMZ.

222
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,202
Does that make me Nixon?

223
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,137
I guess I'm Kissinger.

224
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,740
With you negotiating,
that war would've gone nuclear.

225
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,176
At least in this war
we control all the weapons.

226
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,812
We hope.

227
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,313
Hey, Mort, how ya doin'?
Good to see ya.

228
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,883
Hey, Warren.

229
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,085
We got Howard Stringer
humping Leno's leg.

230
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,054
What are we gonna tell
the G.E. guys if we lose him?

231
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,355
My dog ate my late night host?

232
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,925
I may.

233
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,060
Helen needs a stroking.

234
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,698
Jay.

235
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:07,701
I hear Howard Stringer wants to take
you to Bermuda for a romantic weekend.

236
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,739
- Helen.
- Hi, how are ya?

237
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,473
Jay, honey. It's time to go
get your makeup on.

238
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,108
Your spot starts in 30 minutes.

239
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,178
Manager and network need to
be alone. I can take a hint.

240
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,147
Brandon, watch your wallet.

241
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,418
Hey, David!

242
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,954
Oh, hey, Jay. How ya doin'?

243
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,155
How ya doin'?

244
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,724
- Good.
- What's goin' on?

245
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,292
Listen, how's NBC treating you?

246
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,294
Good, you know. I mean, okay, I guess.

247
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,264
Hey, I saw that show the other
day with Sandra Bernhard,=.

248
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,299
It was great. C'mon, it was great.

249
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,169
You don't know what you're
talkin' about. It was so funny.

250
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,137
I know Morty's down there.
I wanna talk to Morty.

251
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,139
Hey, are you guys
gonna stay around?

252
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,141
No, we gotta take the "red-eye" back.

253
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,376
I hate the "red-eye."

254
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,845
Listen, Jay,

255
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,281
we'll have Morty call ya, and
we'll book you on the show.

256
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,784
When you're not
filling in for Johnny.

257
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,185
You know me, I'm always
ready, whatever,

258
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,519
as long as it's okay with Helen.

259
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,489
Ah, right, of course.

260
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,758
We'll have Morty call Helen
and do it that way.

261
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,293
I'll talk to you later.

262
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,928
Alright, oh, listen, Jay.

263
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,129
Call Morty, alright?

264
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,831
Yeah, tell him to call Helen.

265
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,232
Alrighty.

266
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,234
Good to see ya.

267
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,435
I gotta tell ya,

268
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,871
I got a hell of
an offer from CBS.

269
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,407
I don't know. I mean,
Jay wants to stay

270
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,342
and take over when Carson steps down,

271
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,411
but, Brandon, I need a commitment.

272
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,781
Helen, you're as subtle
as a knee to the groin.

273
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,450
I didn't hear the words
"Tonight Show" in there anywhere.

274
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,119
What are you saying?

275
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,054
You want us to bounce Johnny now?

276
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,357
You wanna deprive him of
reaching his 30th anniversary?

277
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,060
Just lookin' to protect my guy.

278
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,364
Look at her workin' Brandon.
Is she shameless or what?

279
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:48,068
David, I don't see any reason, why
you shouldn't say hello to Brandon.

280
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,336
Oh, for God's sake.

281
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,238
Now's your chance
to let somebody know

282
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,472
that you want "The Tonight Show."

283
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,007
Let's wave him over.

284
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,044
Jesus, you don't "wave"
heads of networks.

285
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,513
You wave waiters and hookers and, uh...

286
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,982
Brandon.

287
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,018
Good Lord,

288
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,287
how can a television show be
worth this much embarrassment?

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,122
- Hey, David!
- Hey, Brandon.

290
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,058
David, I think I heard them
call your category,

291
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:14,194
but don't worry, Littlefield
ran in to accept for you.

292
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,996
Johnny sends his regards, Brandon.

293
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,098
Oh, thank you, Peter,
too bad he couldn't come.

294
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,267
Then I could have
been photographed with
all our late night stars

295
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,236
before they all start
filing for free agency.

296
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,408
David...

297
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,043
I know you want the job
as much as Jay.

298
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,378
Listen, Brandon,

299
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,413
I'm not campaigning for anything.

300
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,248
I'm not saying you are.

301
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,518
I just want you to know
that we haven't forgotten you.

302
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,620
Well, that's, uh,

303
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,122
that's good to hear,
Brandon. Thanks.

304
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,456
Sure.

305
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,359
I was in New York in July,

306
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,961
and I stopped by to see you,

307
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,330
but Laurie said you were in rehearsal--

308
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,333
No, actually, I was
locked in my office, sobbing.

309
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,935
I'm sorry about that.

310
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,171
I'll try not to be
an anti-social jerk next time.

311
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,873
And, Brandon, listen,

312
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,975
I really do appreciate it.

313
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,844
Sure, Dave. Good luck.

314
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,385
I feel like a daddy who's just
gotten all his children to bed.

315
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,894
Brandon, you shit.

316
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,630
We have to talk.

317
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,266
Helen, I'm running through
a contract negotiation

318
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,968
with the guys from "Cheers."

319
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,137
Listen, listen, I've had
it with this runaround.

320
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,505
You don't get by with
verbal assurances anymore.

321
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,008
See, I had a verbal commitment
from Brandon a year ago.

322
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,509
Now, he's gone to Paramount.

323
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,279
You I'm not so fond of,
John. No offense.

324
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,614
You think you can pull the same
manipulative shit with me

325
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,483
you try on everybody
else in this town.

326
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,519
But you fuck with me,
and I'll fuck you back good.

327
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,455
See, I don't have a contract with you.

328
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,390
I can move Jay to CBS within a month.

329
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,426
That would leave you with Carson,
and his retirement-home audience.

330
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,662
So, let's cut the shit, shall we?

331
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,364
Helen, this is just been a busy period.

332
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,565
These things take time.

333
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,667
You're not listening, asshole!

334
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,170
I don't wanna hear about time.
I want a piece of paper.

335
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,605
I don't know when Carson's gonna
get the fucking message and quit.

336
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,941
I want Jay signed.

337
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,576
Helen, I hear you.

338
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,078
Believe me.

339
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,246
Let me see what I can do.
Give me one week?

340
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,282
A week's seven days, John.

341
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,084
Trust me, I can count.

342
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,551
Right.

343
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,041
Jesus Christ.

344
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,478
Oh, man.

345
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,983
- Hey, Morty.
- Have you seen this?

346
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,221
Jesus Christ. What the hell is this?

347
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,057
From what I can tell,
there's no source for it.

348
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,727
What's this mean, now, Morty?

349
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,162
It means nothing.

350
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,596
It means Helen got on the phone.

351
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,332
I mean, this has to be Helen.

352
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,734
Yeah, but, would NBC
treat Johnny this way?

353
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,170
This is ridiculous.

354
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,339
I can't believe this
would've happened if Brandon
hadn't gone to Paramount.

355
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,107
I mean, he had some control.

356
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,209
Helen wouldn't dare pull this
shit when Brandon was there.

357
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,412
Maybe this is all NBC.
It's their way of dealing Jay in.

358
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,248
No, don't assume
these assholes have a plan.

359
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,250
It's the New York Post, for God's sake.

360
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,353
- What's that mean?
- It's not NBC's style.

361
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,021
Alright.

362
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,591
Let's see how these guys
weasel out of this one.

363
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,126
We have to control the rumors.

364
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,295
"We have to control the rumors?"

365
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,297
You have to control the rumors.

366
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,466
So, how do we word the release?

367
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,469
Maybe we should just talk about
the network's huge debt to Johnny.

368
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,171
No words like

369
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,605
"and we hope the king will
reign for many years to come?"

370
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,040
No!

371
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,478
Okay.

372
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,679
Helen's work, right?

373
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,282
What do you think?

374
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,417
This probably came from
the Carson people.

375
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,319
They know they're in trouble.

376
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,154
They're tryin' to screw you
by leakin' a story.

377
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,689
They wanna make you look
so fuckin' eager,

378
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,324
you'll do anything
to get the job.

379
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,127
I guess that makes sense.

380
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,761
I'm just worried about Johnny.

381
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,730
What are you worried about him
for? He doesn't worry about you.

382
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,365
I don't know. That's the problem.

383
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,733
I don't think he really likes me.

384
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,069
There you go with
that "like" shit again.

385
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,105
What the hell difference does it make
whether Carson likes you or not?

386
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,673
I mean, he's not pickin'
his successor. NBC is.

387
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,609
Oh, you don't think
they'll give him a vote?

388
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,211
No, I don't!

389
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,412
Would you leave
the campaigning to me?

390
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,580
Go! Do your fuckin' jokes.

391
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,283
I wanna be able to swear to Johnny
that this didn't come from us.

392
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,319
So, go ahead and swear.

393
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,659
Hello.

394
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,361
Johnny! Hey, it's Jay.

395
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,463
- Jay?
- Yeah, how ya doin'?

396
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,366
Look, I just wanted to talk to you

397
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,301
about this rotten article in the post.

398
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,503
I just wanted to tell you,
to make it clear to you,

399
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,407
that it didn't come from us.

400
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,244
Actually, you've been
the G.E. employee of the week,

401
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,511
haven't you, there, Paul?

402
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,248
Gee, Dave, I guess
I missed out on that one.

403
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,252
Well, it's quite an honor, Paul.

404
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,287
Kids, why don't we find out

405
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,124
who the G.E. employee
of the week is this week.

406
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,593
Right here, on our show,

407
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,430
we can reveal the name of
the G.E. employee of the week.

408
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,831
Anton, can we have a--

409
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,734
There we go.

410
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,636
Let's see who it is
this week, huh, Paul?

411
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,606
Warren Littlefield and John Agoglia.

412
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,846
Well, this is the reason
I went into television.

413
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,318
So my family can see me
being insulted in front
of 4 million people.

414
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,153
He's got the microphone,

415
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,388
and we're helpless.

416
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,490
Forget about it.

417
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,326
I've been looking through
these ratings charts you sent me.

418
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,162
You know how well Jay is doing.

419
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,664
Yeah...

420
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:55,502
Prime time revenues
are next to nothing.

421
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,571
I'm thinking about all the money
we've got riding on "Late Night."

422
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,773
The last thing we need
is a problem there.

423
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,709
Well, we've already got one.

424
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,377
Helen Kushnick.

425
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,246
The woman's forcing the issue.

426
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,581
So far we've been able
to keep her in line

427
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,882
with verbal assurances.

428
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,319
Leno's in line for "The Tonight Show."

429
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,387
Plus we've committed serious money

430
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,922
if Leno doesn't get the show.

431
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,424
Two, three million.

432
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,726
But she'll forfeit
the money, and go to CBS.

433
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,229
And that could be
a disaster for us.

434
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,896
We've still got
Carson and Letterman.

435
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,766
A lot of people believe that Leno

436
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,868
is the hottest talent in television.

437
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,471
It would be a major
mistake to lose Jay now.

438
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,908
Especially, since Johnny
doesn't have that long to go.

439
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,645
John has never said one word
to me about quitting.

440
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,482
Well, it may get to the point
where we can't wait any longer.

441
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,252
You wanna get rid
of Johnny Carson?

442
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,487
His ratings are softening.

443
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,256
Arsenio's got the younger viewers.

444
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,525
That's where the money is.

445
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,228
We've gotta make sure
the future is secure.

446
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,664
If we give Jay a firm deal now,

447
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,332
give him a contract

448
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,768
that guarantees him the show
whenever Johnny leaves.

449
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,903
I think he and Helen
would go for it.

450
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,806
Yeah, but, where does that
leave us with Letterman?

451
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,909
He can't go anywhere.
We've got him for two more years.

452
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,846
And Letterman's never once
asked us to guarantee him
the show if Johnny quits.

453
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,682
Dave is still our 12:30 guy.

454
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,917
We'll make sure he stays there.
All we need to do now

455
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,322
is get Jay signed-- keep him off CBS.

456
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,991
And, this should stay between us,

457
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,560
Helen and Jay.

458
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,797
Carson doesn't have to know.
Letterman doesn't have to know.

459
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,998
It never makes the papers.

460
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,434
That is essential.

461
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,902
I don't want anybody writing

462
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,971
that NBC is pushing
Johnny Carson out the door.

463
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,642
I want this handled very carefully.

464
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,283
John and I are friends.

465
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,286
But we've gotta have
"Late Night" locked up.

466
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,055
If that means a deal for Leno...

467
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,790
Let's do it.

468
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,998
Jay is the host

469
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:09,502
the first week night
after Carson's last show.

470
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,771
Helen is the executive producer.

471
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:15,442
NBC productions owns the show.

472
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,877
Now, of course, no word of this

473
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,346
leaves this room.

474
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,981
No.

475
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,983
Oh...

476
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:29,389
Helen gets this fat check.

477
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,591
I think you could say
this is the impossible dream

478
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,494
coming true for two people, huh?

479
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,829
I think, Helen, they've
got us where they want us.

480
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,431
Well, you see,

481
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,333
I would've said it
the other way around.

482
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,810
Let's give a big hand

483
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,346
for the stars of our 1992 fall line-up.

484
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,757
Well, you've seen...

485
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,460
The new programs for our fall season,

486
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,928
and, I hope our affiliates

487
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,063
and our friends in the
advertising community agree

488
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,965
we've put new life into prime time.

489
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,403
And, now the last surprise of the day,

490
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,637
ladies and gentlemen,

491
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,539
the king of
late night television

492
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:23,610
soon to begin his 30th year at NBC,

493
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,379
heeeeeeeere's Johnny!

494
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,796
Thank you.

495
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,665
That's very nice of you.

496
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,135
Gee, what a fast-paced afternoon.

497
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,671
You folks must be
just short of a coma.

498
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:57,577
You know, I always
get a little awestruck

499
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,848
to think of the great men
who've graced this stage.

500
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,650
Jascha Heifitz.

501
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,151
Vladimir Horowitz.

502
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,053
And today...

503
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,788
Warren Littlefield.

504
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,093
Kind of knocks the hell
out of Darwin's theory,

505
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,762
doesn't it?

506
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,666
Jay Leno,

507
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,534
who's now the
guest host on our show,

508
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,537
is driving me
nuts backstage.

509
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,738
"How're you feeling?"

510
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,674
"Your thyroid okay?"

511
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:31,210
You know, I like Jay, and he is
very concerned about my health.

512
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,213
In fact, he suggested I take
a run through Central Park

513
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,749
about midnight tonight.

514
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,888
Anyway, I know it's been
a long afternoon.

515
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,157
I just wanna say,
this is the last year

516
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,860
that I'm doing "The Tonight Show."

517
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,962
What did he just say about
this being the last year?

518
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,864
I don't know.

519
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,201
But, my last show
is gonna be one year from now,

520
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:58,671
May the 22nd, 1992.

521
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,643
I just wanna thank you.

522
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,011
I am very grateful...

523
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,116
And, I bid you, good-bye.

524
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,090
This is real.

525
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,560
I just said it. The world heard me.

526
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,495
It's real.

527
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,130
Great tie, Bob. Terrific.

528
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,934
Did you know about this, John?

529
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,702
Mr. Littlefield, can
I just ask a question?

530
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:33,205
I would like to thank you, Johnny,

531
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,542
and, thank you for coming,

532
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:39,579
and the bathrooms are
down the hall and to the right.

533
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,617
Warren, what the hell is going on?

534
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,852
I had no goddamn idea--

535
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,621
We have no release
prepared, nothing.

536
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,122
Betty, why don't you--

537
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,693
The press is going to fry us like
bacon strips is what I'm going to say.

538
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,195
...the advertises and the world
with our asses hanging out.

539
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,597
I didn't know anything.
He didn't say a word to me.

540
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,066
So who's it gonna be?
Who gets "The Tonight Show?"

541
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,802
I'm not gonna answer
any questions right now.

542
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,203
Is it Leno or Letterman?

543
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,540
Stay tuned, everybody. Stay tuned.

544
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,676
Thanks, bye.

545
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,846
Mr. Leno?

546
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,548
There's a phone call for you, sir.

547
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:16,749
I'd like to show you
to the the courtesy phone.

548
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,785
Oh, alright.

549
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:21,621
Excuse me, aren't you
the Doritos guy?

550
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,790
Johnny announced
he was quittin' today.

551
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,124
What?

552
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,226
What are you talk--
I was just with him.

553
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,228
He went on last,
long after you'd gone.

554
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,097
He just dumped it on 'em.

555
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,065
He said he was doing the show
one more year and then out.

556
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,835
Did they make any kind
of announcement about us?

557
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,705
Nothin', they were too busy
trying to pull up their pants.

558
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,840
But, it'll come. The deal is set.

559
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,942
We got it, Jay! One more year!

560
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:46,879
His last show is May 22nd.
Our first is May 25th. Memorial Day.

561
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,115
God, I'm havin' a hard time
gettin' my breath.

562
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,783
I'm hearing what my
mother always said,

563
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,685
"Be careful what you wish for,
you might get it."

564
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:56,723
I know what you mean...
It's still a secret, right?

565
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,691
We can't, you know,
say anything about it?

566
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,159
We've waited this long.

567
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,662
What difference does
another day or two make?

568
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:06,332
Yeah, I guess, they wanna,
probably wanna tell Dave first.

569
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,735
You're such a nice guy, Jay Leno!

570
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,770
Worrying about your old friend, Dave?

571
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,105
You wanna know the real
difference between you and Letterman?

572
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,341
You had me. Enough!

573
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,177
Now, go do your show in Tahoe.
Have a good time.

574
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,860
Yes, Sparky!

575
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,398
Oh, yes, good boy!

576
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,267
Alright, we're gonna
be right back

577
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,002
with a commercial.

578
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,303
Paul, get us out.

579
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,209
Hey, Peter, how are ya?

580
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,979
Good to see ya. Is John here?

581
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,246
Yes, he's here, and he's ready.

582
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,716
You're not gonna believe this.

583
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,386
Johnny announced his retirement
at the affiliates meeting
in Carnegie Hall.

584
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,855
What do you mean he announced his--
When? When's he gonna retire?

585
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,390
A year from now.

586
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,792
One more year on the air.
That's what he said.

587
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,194
Holy shit. And did NBC
make an announ--

588
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,096
No. No.

589
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,899
No announcement from NBC.

590
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,333
Okay, 20 seconds.

591
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:20,406
Can you fucking believe this?

592
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,974
Isn't this amazing?

593
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,711
Five, four, three,

594
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,912
two...

595
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,113
Ed couldn't make it.

596
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,081
I happened to be
in the neighborhood.

597
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,684
So, I brought you
a little something.

598
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,285
What's this?

599
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,255
You're the winner of
the million dollar sweepstakes.

600
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:42,929
Morty, Johnny asked me to
stay on until the show's done,

601
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,697
and I told him I would.

602
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,265
After that, I'm all yours.

603
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:49,168
That's great. 'Cause we both want you.

604
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,437
No, I just happened to be in town

605
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,940
doing a something for the affiliates.

606
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:57,043
You quit, Johnny. You quit your job!

607
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,211
That's the business you came to--

608
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:02,481
Jesus Christ, this guy is so good.

609
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,216
I cannot fucking believe

610
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,019
we haven't heard from Agoglia,
Wright or Littlefield.

611
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,021
None of 'em.

612
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,990
Maybe they lost the number.

613
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,031
So, we can handle unpleasant Dave?

614
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,367
Well, it's real simple.
First we slap him,

615
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,335
and then we kiss up.

616
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,205
There's only so much
kissin' up I'm capable of.

617
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:30,109
I got a signed contract
with this guy's name on it.

618
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,411
Fuck him and his bruised ego.

619
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,248
My ass is bruised from sittin'
on a goddamn plane.

620
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,350
So, you want Morty
to sit behind the desk?

621
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,086
Alright, fine. I can do that.

622
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,989
Okay, no, no.
Is this gonna work, Peter?

623
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,791
- Hello.
- Hello, gentlemen.

624
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,893
Dave will be with you
in just a few more minutes.

625
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,260
Great, thanks.

626
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,461
Can I get you some coffee
while you wait?

627
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,863
Please, black?

628
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,331
Yeah, I'd love some, thanks.

629
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,440
Oh, God, they're here.

630
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,076
They look like such worms, I tell ya.

631
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,245
It's Littlefield.

632
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:09,215
Yeah, Agoglia's with him.

633
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,482
Oh, great, thank you.

634
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,284
You're welcome.

635
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,122
The coffee is freezing.

636
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,891
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do this.

637
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,961
Don't worry. Alright. Thanks, Peter.

638
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,830
Morty, sit behind my desk.

639
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,431
You sit at the desk.

640
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,834
I'm gonna sit right here.

641
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,269
And, I'm gonna
put them over there.

642
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,407
Hi ya, Warren, how ya doin'?
Good to see ya.

643
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,409
Thanks for coming.

644
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,445
And, you are?

645
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,213
C'mon, Dave. John Agoglia.

646
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,582
Oh, yeah, John. Good to see ya.
How ya doin'? Thanks for comin'.

647
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,484
Why don't you have a seat over here?

648
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,123
Dave, you know why we're here.

649
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:55,261
The network has been analyzing
the "Late Night" situation,

650
00:29:55,294 --> 00:30:00,432
and we've watched Jay
grow into the role of host.

651
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,269
Obviously, we have every reason to
be proud of what you've accomplished,

652
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,204
but a choice had to be made.

653
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:09,008
And, so, tomorrow NBC will announce
that Jay Leno has been named

654
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:14,446
the next host of "The Tonight Show."

655
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,450
And, I'm sure that Jay
will do a fine job.

656
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,219
But, I must tell you

657
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:25,557
that we have done
this show for 10 years.

658
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:29,528
And, we know how to do this show.

659
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,864
Now, the best thing would've
been for all of us here

660
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:35,501
to have gone on and done
"The Tonight Show."

661
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,237
That's what we always
wanted to do.

662
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,606
And, it's a real disappointment

663
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,474
that we're not.

664
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,976
But,

665
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,513
if it is your final decision...

666
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,615
then, you can contact my lawyer.

667
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,121
Gentlemen, this is
completely unacceptable.

668
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:58,057
I want you to release me
from my contract.

669
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,231
What is this?

670
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:09,301
I mean, where does
this leave us, Morty?

671
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,170
I mean, how can we make him happy?

672
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,105
You wanna keep him happy?

673
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,974
Do as he asks.

674
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,208
He wants "The Tonight Show."

675
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,578
Well, short of that.

676
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,613
We have a plan

677
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:25,451
for enhancing Dave's role
on "Late Night."

678
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,955
We want to make it
a seamless two-hour block

679
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,389
right after Jay takes over the show.

680
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,959
No, Johnny, you don't understand.

681
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,426
Dave wants "The Tonight Show."

682
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,162
Period.

683
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,597
Well, I'm afraid
that just isn't possible.

684
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,400
Why isn't that possible?

685
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,170
Morty.

686
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:47,106
You already have
a deal with Leno?

687
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,576
You do, don't you?

688
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,411
Let's just say
a decision has been made.

689
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,146
"A decision has been made?"

690
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,415
It's over, so, if you
wanna help us out, Morty,

691
00:31:56,448 --> 00:32:01,187
you tell me how NBC can make Dave
enthused about doing the 12:30 show.

692
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,558
Morty!

693
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,127
He'll be back.

694
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,329
Hold my calls, Pam?

695
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,198
Okay, Mr. Morton.

696
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,100
Oh, Morty! Ah!

697
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,401
Not bad, huh?

698
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,136
No, I sucked.

699
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,670
No, you didn't suck, Dave.

700
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,673
There's something there.
I've known those guys...

701
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,976
Warren Littlefield
has never seen me like that--

702
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,411
David, David--

703
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,979
They thought I was
George Peppard or something.

704
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,414
- It didn't work...
- Well, we don't know that...

705
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,382
Yes, we do know. They just told me

706
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,451
in their own charming
fucking and imitable way.

707
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,720
They're going with Jay.

708
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,689
As far as NBC's concerned, you're 12:30.

709
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,427
And, that's it?

710
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,495
Yeah.

711
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,600
That's it.

712
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,738
Fuck.

713
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,745
David, I know you're depressed,

714
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,713
but you have to keep fighting.

715
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,249
Fighting for what?

716
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:06,185
I'm fucked. I'm finished.
My time is up.

717
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,254
It's the end of the road for TV boy.

718
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:11,323
David, don't get into that.

719
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,326
Do you want The Tonight Show?

720
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,562
Why don't you ask me
if I want to play

721
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,796
centerfield for the Yankees?

722
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,631
Of course I want "The Tonight Show."
It's my--

723
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,237
Since I was 10 years old,

724
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:27,573
it's the only dream of my whole life.

725
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,775
Alright, what are you
gonna do about it?

726
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,411
You can't just want it.
You have to do something.

727
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,746
I have done a television program
on their network

728
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,215
for the last 10 years.

729
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,783
What do you want me
to do about it?

730
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,718
I put a penalty clause
in my contract

731
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,287
if they don't give me
The Tonight Show.

732
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,090
How much?

733
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,391
A million dollars.

734
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,559
Oh, David, that's tip money
to those guys.

735
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:50,362
Alright, I'm a pinhead, Pete.
I didn't know what I was doing.

736
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,264
C'mon, now what'll I do?

737
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,700
I just want that show.

738
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,736
I'm only really happy
that one hour a day

739
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,471
when I'm doing my show.

740
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,740
You will have a show.
You're a television star.

741
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,509
People will wanna hire you.

742
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,679
Yeah, who, CBS?
CBS just fired Pat Sajak. Pat Sajak.

743
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,548
Their gums are still bleeding.

744
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,417
They don't wanna hear the words
"Late Night" ever again.

745
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,684
ABC?

746
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,354
ABC's got Ted Koppel on at 11:30.

747
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,656
He's the gold standard.

748
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,159
I'm nickel-plating.

749
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,693
So, what does that leave?
Syndication?

750
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,229
Oh, what a feeling!

751
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,264
Can you imagine
being sold by a syndicator.

752
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,233
"Uh, we got Letterman,

753
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,500
or Studs."

754
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,503
"You can either have
Studs or Letterman."

755
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,439
I'm fucked, Pete.

756
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,507
Listen, David.

757
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,310
Don't accept what NBC
is doing to you.

758
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,611
You simply can't.

759
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,647
You must not follow Jay Leno.

760
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,649
Because you'll hate yourself
for the rest of your life.

761
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,151
It'll make you crazy.

762
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,353
Yeah, but, I've already
lost the job to him.

763
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:49,888
What else am I gonna do?

764
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,490
How about getting an agent?

765
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,625
Now, don't reject
the idea out of hand.

766
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,494
I know how you feel about agents.

767
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,829
But, we need somebody with
some power in the business.

768
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,898
Yeah, I know, but, Jesus, an agent?

769
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,268
I mean, an agent's what you pull
off the bottom of your shoe

770
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,569
after a baseball game.

771
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,571
They're just gonna book me in Tahoe

772
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,406
with Tony Orlando and Dawn.

773
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,542
Listen, David, I have an idea.

774
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,546
David. Peter.

775
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,182
Mike Ovitz.

776
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,484
Please come in.
It's wonderful to have you here.

777
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,457
David, I don't know
if you remember this,

778
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,426
but years ago when you
were with William Morris

779
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,195
and I was still an agent there,

780
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,263
we actually met very briefly.

781
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,865
Geez, I can't believe
you remembered that.

782
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,367
What I remember is

783
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,336
you were the funniest
guy in the room.

784
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,207
In fact, I don't think we got
much accomplished that day.

785
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,675
Michael, maybe we should
tell you a little bit

786
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,211
about David's circumstances.

787
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,913
Peter, I know Dave's circumstances.

788
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,816
And, so I know why you're here.

789
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,352
Dave is a star of
such compelling stature

790
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,487
that, frankly, it makes me
personally angry

791
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:58,190
he finds himself this abused.

792
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,891
We pride ourselves here at C.A.A.

793
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,860
in developing a career plan
for our clients

794
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,397
that protects them as much
as it enriches them.

795
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:09,468
David has set such an incredibly
high professional standard,

796
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,239
and yet he is going
disturbingly unrewarded.

797
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,940
That just doesn't make sense.

798
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:18,344
It's simply bad business practice.

799
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:21,947
Obviously, we have an intense interest

800
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,882
in establishing a business
relationship with you, Dave.

801
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,684
And with you, Peter.

802
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:29,721
Frankly, we have worked out
a career plan for David,

803
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,558
and it includes securing
everything for Dave

804
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,426
that he wants.

805
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,495
Everything.

806
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,499
Of course, that means an
11:30 television show.

807
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,601
Dave will be offered an
11:30 show,

808
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,371
and he will be offered it
by every network.

809
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:48,340
The geometry of the deal
will be far larger.

810
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:49,575
The studios will be in.

811
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,009
The syndicators.

812
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,579
The full range of
the entertainment industry.

813
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,281
We shall frame a deal

814
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,449
that will make you
one of the giants.

815
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,654
And, if you give us the privilege

816
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,623
of working with you...

817
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,629
C.A.A. will take care of
everything your talents deserve

818
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,964
and your spirit desires.

819
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,539
Water?

820
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,973
Huh?

821
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,755
Jesus, that was like,

822
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,824
having a meeting with the...

823
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,392
The Godfather.

824
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,399
Hello?

825
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,734
Hi Warren.

826
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,001
Good morning.

827
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,803
Theresa told me
I'd find you in the car.

828
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,372
Good morning, Helen. How are things?

829
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,541
Well, I've had it
with the Carson people.

830
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,908
Tryin' to get anything outta them.

831
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,410
They wouldn't put Jay on the show.

832
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,778
They wouldn't pass the baton.

833
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,313
Pass the what, Helen?

834
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:04,316
Pass the baton.
I had this great idea.

835
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,685
I thought Johnny
should say good-bye Friday,

836
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,053
leave his desk,

837
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,555
take his hand-held mic,

838
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,889
walk over to our studio

839
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,424
and hand it over to Jay

840
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:13,892
right on the air... pass the baton.

841
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,928
And you suggested this? To whom?

842
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,831
Peter Lassally.
It was like I peed on his shoe.

843
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,767
Well, you know,

844
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,902
I think they might wanna finish
up on their own terms, Helen.

845
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,937
You'll have plenty of time
for your own ideas.

846
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,839
We sure will, starting Monday.

847
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,841
Now, I wanna talk
about the ad again.

848
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,677
We've been over this, Helen,

849
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,912
and, we can't buy an ad
for Jay in Friday's paper

850
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,081
because we've already bought
a full-page ad there

851
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,583
to say good-bye to Johnny.

852
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,418
Why can't NBC buy a full-page ad

853
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,387
to welcome Jay to face Johnny's ad?

854
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,422
Because, as I told you before,

855
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,791
the paper's doing its
own full page of stories

856
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,461
saluting Johnny on
the page opposite the ad,

857
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,797
and we're not gonna crowd that

858
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,099
with a "Welcome Jay" ad.
That's it. End of story, Helen.

859
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:57,636
No, it's not end of story,
Warren. I'm telling you now,
that ad's goin' in on Friday.

860
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,605
If NBC won't buy the fucking thing,

861
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,840
then I'll pay for it myself,
but that ad is going in.

862
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,576
No, it isn't going in, Helen,
and it's not gonna be your money,

863
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,045
and you're not doing it
because I will not allow it.

864
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,780
We've thought about it,

865
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,482
we've listened,
and we've made a decision,

866
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,885
and that decision is final.

867
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,788
Boy, I knew I could expect
shit like this from a dickless

868
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:19,157
wonder like you.
- Well, fuck you, Helen.

869
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,528
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on!

870
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,630
You're wrong. We're not gonna
do this. I will not allow it.

871
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,932
You closed Jay's
contract, didn't you?

872
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,601
You are out of your fucking mind!

873
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:31,169
But, I got the fucking show anyway.

874
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,905
I can see that this man
is embraced by this--

875
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:36,608
It's your only natural
talent Warren. Fucking up!

876
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:39,010
And, enough. It's over. Done.

877
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,052
So, this is it, huh?

878
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,657
I am one of the lucky people
in the world because

879
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,561
I got to do something
I've always wanted to do,

880
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,464
and I've enjoyed
every minute of it.

881
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,833
And, I can only tell you,

882
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,769
it's been an honor

883
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:06,137
to come into your homes,

884
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,608
and let me entertain you.

885
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:13,211
And, I hope when I do
find something that I wanna do,

886
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,082
you will still invite me
into your home

887
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,684
as you always have.

888
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:24,155
I bid you a very
heartfelt good-bye.

889
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,041
Is this where you want me to stand?

890
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,609
I always stand right here.

891
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,611
Where the fuck is Billy Crystal?

892
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,212
And why hasn't he arrived yet?

893
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,549
Stand up straight, for Chrissake.

894
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,617
You're the host of
The Tonight Show!

895
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:27,218
So, Jay, how's it goin'?

896
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,687
Aw, you know me.

897
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,188
Yeah, Mr. Stress.

898
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,790
You look like you're
ready to take a nap.

899
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,091
Maybe I will.

900
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,926
I just want to get it over with.

901
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,295
You know what I want to talk to you about?
I think we should lose the second Perot joke.

902
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,765
Listen, Jay. Don't you think
it would be appropriate

903
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,100
to say something nice about Johnny

904
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,301
early in the show, you know?

905
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,170
That wasn't my decision.

906
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,572
Yeah, but still, I mean...

907
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,906
Bob Wright?

908
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,842
Him, I guess, I have to talk to.

909
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,243
Hi, Bob!

910
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:54,045
So nice of you to check in today.

911
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,748
Thanks, Helen.

912
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:59,284
I just called to
wish Jay well tonight.

913
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,186
I'm sure he's gonna
have a great show.

914
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,322
Oh, thanks. I'm doing everything
I can to make sure that happens.

915
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,757
I'm sure you are.

916
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,593
Listen,

917
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,960
Helen.

918
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,997
I did have one other thought.

919
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,666
What's Jay gonna do
to thank Johnny?

920
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,935
We're not gonna do anything.

921
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,137
- I'd like to hear why.
- You wanna know why?

922
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,872
Okay.

923
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:23,208
The new show is going to be entirely
different from the old show.

924
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,577
We don't want to look
like we're beholden
to Johnny's old audience.

925
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:27,813
Get that outta here!

926
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,682
Every comic knows you salute
the last guy to get more
applause for yourself.

927
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,984
I mean, that's kiss-up stuff.
Jay doesn't do kiss-up.

928
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,920
I think it's a terrible mistake, Helen.

929
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,190
It boils down to simple politeness.

930
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,992
Now, I would really like
for you to go down there

931
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,961
and tell Jay to say
something like--

932
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,030
"I wouldn't be here but for John."

933
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,266
No, I'm not gonna go to Jay
one hour before a live broadcast

934
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,301
and tell him to insert some
tribute to Johnny Carson.

935
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,237
Absolutely not.

936
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,006
But, I appreciate your good wishes,
and I'll tell Jay you called.

937
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,651
From the NBC studios in Burbank,

938
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,387
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

939
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,192
Featuring Branford Marsalis
and The Tonight Show band.

940
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:19,297
Tonight, Jay welcomes
comedian Billy Crystal.

941
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:24,002
And musical guest Garth Brooks.

942
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:28,106
And now, Jay Leno!

943
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,088
You're gonna love this.

944
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,057
I got official notice from C.A.A.

945
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,426
"All future business activity
for David Letterman

946
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,197
will be handled through
Michael Ovitz's office."

947
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,899
What, they fired Ovitz?
What, is he trying to get sprung?

948
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,334
He'd have to hire God for that!

949
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,704
Well, let's think about this.

950
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:00,939
Dave didn't hire Mike Ovitz to
get a five-year-deal out of us

951
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,942
to stay at 12:30. That's not
a big enough move for him.

952
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,343
Now, this only works

953
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,779
if he gets 11:30 for Dave.

954
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,815
You're not listening, Warren.

955
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,250
Dave can bring Machiavelli
back from the dead.

956
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,119
It still does not
do him any good.

957
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,754
I made this deal.

958
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,223
We've got full protection.
What is he gonna do?

959
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,725
Ovitz, huh?

960
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,293
Put him on television
in Venezuela!

961
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,762
Come on.

962
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,700
This Letterman contract
has clauses in it

963
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,335
a prisoner wouldn't have!

964
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,137
How the hell do
we get him out of it?

965
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,941
Give me all the bad news.

966
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,743
Whatever deal we make
they have a right to match,

967
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:40,411
and they can take a full year
to match which means

968
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:42,714
they could keep him
off the air if they want.

969
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,217
That sounds like something
you'd have in a deal

970
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:49,020
for a sports announcer from
some local radio station.

971
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,723
It gets worse. NBC has first
negotiating position.

972
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:53,859
We can't even talk a deal
with anybody but them

973
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:57,095
for 18 months. No offers. Nothing.

974
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,964
Okay, so we don't negotiate.

975
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:00,799
We can still talk
to people, right?

976
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,467
Sure, we can talk. What then?

977
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,335
Then we set up pitches.

978
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,171
We can't pitch Letterman around,
Mike. NBC would challenge it.

979
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,874
No, we don't pitch
David Letterman to anybody.

980
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:12,310
They pitch themselves to us.
We reverse the process.

981
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,913
And it's legal too?

982
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:16,514
Yes!

983
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,951
We can't stop somebody
from talking to us.

984
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:23,721
Pardon me.

985
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:28,526
Rod.

986
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,495
Howard! Oh, I beg your pardon.

987
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,864
I made the plane in 14 seconds!

988
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,533
I'm glad you made it. We need you here.
All the heavy weights are coming in.

989
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,969
I heard Eisner's going
to be pitching Disney himself.

990
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:40,405
I wish they'd made it clearer earlier

991
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,407
that this was a true pitch.

992
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,142
Morton called me yesterday

993
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,811
and told me they'd see me here.

994
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,212
That's the first time
I knew I had to come.

995
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,047
All I had in the Hamptons
was this old suit.

996
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,448
And then I get on
the plane, I realize

997
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,950
I have no bloody cuff links.

998
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,351
Paper clips.

999
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,086
I'm just afraid
Letterman will see them

1000
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,454
and conclude that Larry Tisch
is an even bigger tight-wad

1001
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,890
than G.E., which isn't far wrong.

1002
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,961
Hello, Rod.

1003
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,100
Hi, Rod.

1004
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,536
Gentlemen, I'm sorry. We're
under a bit of a time constraint,

1005
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,805
so I just wanted to say
that we're here because

1006
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,041
we wanna get acquainted
with how you do business

1007
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:18,409
and to see how Dave might
fit in with your plans.

1008
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,947
I would like to reiterate
this is not a negotiation.

1009
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,215
It is, for want of
a better word, a process.

1010
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,818
So, Howard, would you
like to speak for CBS?

1011
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:28,053
Terrific.

1012
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:32,290
David, I know that you
have an appreciation

1013
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,893
for the history and tradition
of broadcasting.

1014
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:38,897
Much of that tradition
has been written by CBS.

1015
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,067
Even in England, we knew Jack Benny,

1016
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,270
and Lucy and Gleason.

1017
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:49,474
Does David Letterman
fit that tradition?

1018
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,109
Like a glove.

1019
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,179
The point is,
the CBS of the present,

1020
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:57,015
can give you what
you want, David--

1021
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,150
affiliate strength.

1022
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:00,919
Strong management,

1023
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:03,254
excellent promotion,

1024
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:09,560
and, yes, we have space available
at 11:30 every weeknight.

1025
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:12,197
And we're a network.

1026
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,499
We're what you want, Dave.

1027
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,401
We're a home.

1028
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,605
Michael.

1029
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:23,341
Thank you so much for coming.

1030
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,443
You have a young audience.

1031
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,312
We're the young network.

1032
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,081
We're also the only
ones capable of

1033
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:33,451
offering you a
start time of 11pm.

1034
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,421
That will give you
the jump on Mr. Leno.

1035
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,293
Hiya Robert. Good to see you.

1036
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,129
Thank you so much for coming.

1037
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:47,632
ABC has always been the
network for the young viewers.

1038
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:51,903
We know how to reach that
audience and deliver it to you.

1039
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:54,205
I'm not gonna say here today

1040
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,243
what we're gonna do
about Nightline, but...

1041
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:01,246
Hi, Al. Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.

1042
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,150
We'll build the entire
syndication operation at Columbia

1043
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:07,285
around David Letterman
and Late Night.

1044
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,021
We expect we could
launch nationally

1045
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,589
with a lineup of stations

1046
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,424
as strong as any network's.

1047
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,027
Ah, that sounds great, Bob.

1048
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:17,328
Uh, Alan...

1049
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,964
Whatever.

1050
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,201
Hi, Brandon.
I appreciate it.

1051
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,602
Thank you.

1052
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,437
At Paramount, we've
proved with Arsenio

1053
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:27,705
we already know how to
make late night work

1054
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,574
in syndication.

1055
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,142
I think it's a perfect match--

1056
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:35,513
Arsenio followed by Letterman.

1057
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,053
I'd follow the example
of their nominee...

1058
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:44,956
...don't inhale!

1059
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,591
Listen to this old fool.

1060
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:49,560
On and on and on and on.

1061
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,638
It's getting close to 11:00.

1062
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,573
The local news will start late.

1063
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,642
Get Warren on the phone.

1064
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,477
Great. We reschedule
our fucking lives

1065
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,213
to do a live show
so Jay can follow up

1066
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,648
their ghastly convention
coverage with some new jokes.

1067
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,184
Then they won't let us
on the goddamn air.

1068
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:15,520
Motherfuckers in news
fucking us again!

1069
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:16,988
Warren,

1070
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,223
they're letting this go on.

1071
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,657
He's not gonna finish by 11.

1072
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,692
I swear to you,
I'm sending my audience home

1073
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,195
if you don't get this over on time.

1074
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:25,563
No, I'm not losing it!

1075
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,465
You said you had this under control!

1076
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,503
Look, a pause! Right there!

1077
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:34,039
They could've cut him off!

1078
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,641
Get me Gartner in Houston,
goddammit!

1079
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,310
It's 11pm in the east right now!

1080
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,179
Mr. Gartner. Phone for you.

1081
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:44,082
Helen Kushnick on the line.

1082
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:45,650
Yeah, Gartner here.

1083
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,053
You promised me you'd be
off by 11, you shit-head.

1084
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,787
I'm goin' live tonight
so we can get some pay-off

1085
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,689
from your horseshit
convention coverage.

1086
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:55,093
I'm accommodating you by
giving Brokaw air time with Jay.

1087
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,762
You get this gas bag Reagan
off the air now,

1088
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,797
or I'm not using Brokaw tonight.

1089
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,367
I don't give a shit
if you use Brokaw tonight

1090
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,302
or any other night, lady.

1091
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,770
And let's get something straight.

1092
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,139
I'm the president of NBC news.

1093
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:10,041
You don't have anything
to do with what I do.

1094
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:11,442
I'm taking you off the air this time,

1095
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,178
you pompous ass.

1096
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:14,545
There's only one person
who can take me off the air.

1097
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,081
Bob Wright.

1098
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:17,482
I'll give you his number. Call him.

1099
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,251
I don't need to call
Bob-fucking-Wright.

1100
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:21,519
I'll send my audience home,

1101
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,554
and then you can call him

1102
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:25,323
and explain why "The Tonight Show"
wasn't on the fucking air.

1103
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,757
Because the news asshole

1104
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,694
couldn't get a horseshit
speech off on time!

1105
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,269
Send 'em home!
Get them the fuck out of here!

1106
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:40,771
Helen, is this a good idea?
I mean, can you do this?

1107
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,373
Hey, who the fuck made you
the executive producer?

1108
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,109
You do the fucking jokes.

1109
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,710
I run the fucking show.
I've made the decision.

1110
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,179
They fucked us, so now
they don't get a show.

1111
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:50,515
Get these fucking
people out of here now!

1112
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,319
There is no show for them to see!

1113
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:57,188
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have, what you might call

1114
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,124
technical difficultys right now.

1115
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:00,525
It's a heck of a thing.

1116
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,327
Have you been watchin'
the convention coverage?

1117
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,528
I could've been a doctor!

1118
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,729
Yeah, well, it's not too late, Rick.

1119
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,197
Oh, Rick.

1120
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,532
We're running a little late,

1121
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,799
but I think we're
gonna be alright.

1122
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,768
The show should start...
I think around 11:45...

1123
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,870
That's great Warren,
but I wanted to, um...

1124
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,106
- Would you hold that thought?
- Well, I was about to call.

1125
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,474
What, what... what?

1126
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,443
You know, what the hell?

1127
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,545
That ship has sailed,
there's nobody here.

1128
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,779
Jesus Christ. She...

1129
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,214
What, she sends the audience home?

1130
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:24,415
We don't have a Tonight Show?

1131
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:25,883
You know,

1132
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,552
I've already sold this
thing to advertisers.

1133
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,354
Christ!

1134
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:31,522
She killed a scheduled show!

1135
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,758
My level of tolerance
with Helen Kushnick

1136
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,193
is completely used up.

1137
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,394
So is ours.

1138
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,728
That woman cancelled
"The Tonight Show"

1139
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,530
with no authorization whatsoever.

1140
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,666
We had less than half an hour
to get that repeat on,

1141
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,234
or we would have gone dark.

1142
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,704
She is completely out of control.

1143
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:49,640
That's become apparent
to everybody now, Bob.

1144
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:51,476
The problem is,
what do we do about it?

1145
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:52,810
If we make a move on Helen now,

1146
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,280
Jay could be injured,
maybe irreparably.

1147
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,148
The guy seems to be
totally dependent on her.

1148
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:59,350
That's his problem, not ours.

1149
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:00,785
It's ours if Jay walks off the show.

1150
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,587
And the ratings have been solid.

1151
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,556
I hate to tamper
with the show. Maybe...

1152
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,493
Maybe we should just
limp along for the a while.

1153
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:10,195
Yeah, and wait for her to self-destruct.

1154
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:13,164
She will. Soon.
The way she's going.

1155
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,699
Then it won't be an issue with Jay...

1156
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,401
And we won't have to pay her off.

1157
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,436
I think it's more
apparent than ever before

1158
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,405
that we should keep our
options open with Letterman.

1159
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:24,709
If you two want to limp along
with this situation for now,

1160
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,477
that's your call.

1161
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:27,678
But at some point,

1162
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:30,348
and it's getting to be soon,

1163
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,817
it's gonna be my call.

1164
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:39,524
I'd just like to say, thank you,

1165
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:43,494
to all of you
for this wonderful tribute.

1166
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:47,498
It has been one of
the most memorable nights

1167
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,367
of my life.

1168
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,168
Thank you.

1169
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,548
Excuse me.

1170
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,665
Maybe it's time for
us to talk, Bob.

1171
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,633
You heard about Kushnick, huh?

1172
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,302
I'm not going to get
in the middle of

1173
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:26,737
whatever it is you need
to do about Kushnick.

1174
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,373
But, if you think it's time

1175
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,308
to get serious about
doing something with Dave,

1176
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,610
I have a few suggestions.

1177
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,445
I'd like to hear them.

1178
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:36,581
- Well...
- I think it's important...

1179
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,449
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

1180
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:40,785
Nice to see you.

1181
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:43,288
I think it's important for NBC,

1182
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,955
if you're really serious
about keeping Dave,

1183
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,392
to start creating some goodwill.

1184
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,527
There's enough animosity
in this relationship

1185
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,396
to start a small war.

1186
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:56,367
In my mind it's all been
stupid and unwarranted.

1187
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,303
Thank you.

1188
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:01,606
I'm all for goodwill.

1189
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,441
What do you have in mind?

1190
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:06,411
Well, we are prevented from
pursuing offers for David

1191
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:08,913
because we are required by NBC

1192
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:11,549
to negotiate with them first.

1193
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,519
But that clause only
serves to insure

1194
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:16,587
that David is not going
to listen to

1195
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,489
any initial offers
that you might make,

1196
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:20,658
generous as they may be,

1197
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:24,429
because naturally he is
going to want to test
the waters elsewhere.

1198
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,364
So we can all play this game,

1199
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:29,700
or we could just loosen
the chains a little bit.

1200
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:33,371
How?

1201
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:37,575
You can allow us to solicit
other offers openly.

1202
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,745
After all, you still
retain matching rights.

1203
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,713
Seems like we're conceding a lot

1204
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,783
for the sake of goodwill.

1205
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:50,855
Maybe you can offer
something in return?

1206
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,626
Our sales department tells me that

1207
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,863
we've sold the Letterman show
to the end of June.

1208
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,766
But, as you know,

1209
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,336
David's contract is up April 2nd.

1210
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,873
So, if we don't resign him,

1211
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:12,009
we'll have to return that money.

1212
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,482
Unless...

1213
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:20,685
Unless we give you
a three month extension.

1214
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,822
Okay, alright,
so that's the deal.

1215
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,791
We give you three months,

1216
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,859
and you free us up to negotiate.

1217
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:34,732
Do you think David
would see that

1218
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,034
as a gesture of goodwill?

1219
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,337
I believe I can
assure you that he would.

1220
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:55,152
Hello, Howard.

1221
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,754
Mike!

1222
00:55:56,787 --> 00:56:00,458
Listen, we're ready
to talk seriously now.

1223
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,026
Robert Morton on three.

1224
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,961
Morty, how are
things in New York?

1225
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,497
New York is great.
It's great to talk to you too.

1226
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:08,633
I'm sure you're
quite busy with the show.

1227
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,935
Yeah, I'm damn busy.
So what's up?

1228
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,670
Well, you've probably been
too busy to realize

1229
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,071
that you've double
booked one of our guests.

1230
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,506
Apparently you've got Roger Daltry

1231
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,074
the same week we've got him.

1232
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:18,776
Now, I'm sure this is just
an oversight by your staff,

1233
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,411
but I thought I should call

1234
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:22,713
and just let you know
the way we work things.

1235
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,015
You see, we always had this sort of
"gentlemen's agreement" with Johnny...

1236
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,651
Hey, Morty, haven't you noticed,

1237
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,519
I'm no gentleman!

1238
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:30,621
Well, Helen, it's just that
the record company is telling us

1239
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:31,989
you're trying to force Daltry into

1240
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,891
cancelling his
appearance with us.

1241
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,593
I mean, he's our guest, Helen.

1242
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:38,195
He is? Well, let me help
you out here, Morty.

1243
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,965
You have no power with NBC
to back you up on guests.

1244
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:43,434
You really think NBC is
gonna back your show

1245
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:44,835
over mine?

1246
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,203
Your guy was the loser, remember?

1247
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,872
That's a cheap shot, Helen!

1248
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,775
Well, you can expect more
where that came from!

1249
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,643
You have no fuckin' clue
what's goin' on at the network.

1250
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:54,445
You're helpless.

1251
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,213
You really ought have me
do your next contract for ya.

1252
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,848
You're making bupkis next to me.

1253
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,817
You know, I thought we were friends.
I really did.

1254
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,085
But, you know,
let me tell you something,

1255
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:02,820
I will fight you on Daltry,

1256
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:04,489
and I will fight you on every
guest you try to steal.

1257
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:06,824
Ooh, good luck, Mighty Mouse!

1258
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,528
It's Kushnick on one.

1259
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:12,029
Helen!

1260
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:13,631
Kenny, I'll get right to the point.

1261
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:14,999
We see Travis's billboards

1262
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,801
all over town. We want to book him.

1263
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,036
Gee, that's great, Helen.
I mean, that's really nice.

1264
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,738
So when do you want to...

1265
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,540
I mean we want him this week
when he's here for the concert.

1266
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:23,908
Gee, I'm sorry.

1267
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,210
- He's on Arsenio on Wednesday.
- Yeah, I know.

1268
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,613
My bookers told me.
So, cancel it.

1269
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,815
I mean, Arsenio's over with.
He's in the toilet.

1270
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,717
His advertisers are desertin' him.

1271
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,119
By the end of the year there
won't even be an Arsenio.

1272
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:37,555
Well, he's on the air now,
and we're committed there.

1273
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:38,756
I guess you're not hearing me.

1274
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,024
Let me spell it out for you--

1275
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:42,860
if you want Travis
on this show ever again,

1276
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,029
you better break
that date with Arsenio.

1277
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,698
I think you need to
know something about me.

1278
00:57:47,732 --> 00:57:49,667
I don't respond well to threats.

1279
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,136
Look, maybe I could offer
you something else.

1280
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:54,505
We have a movie of the week
coming up we need to promote

1281
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:56,273
with Kenny Rogers, Travis

1282
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,742
and Naomi Judd.

1283
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,944
What if I could get them
all on the same show...

1284
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,979
Excuse me, this ain't Merv Griffin.

1285
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:03,514
We don't do fuckin' theme shows,

1286
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:04,815
you dumb shit-kickin' hick!

1287
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:06,150
Let me break the news to ya.

1288
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:07,952
Not only is Travis Tritt

1289
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,854
not gonna do
"The Tonight Show" ever again,

1290
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:12,022
but you and I are gonna be
in this town for a long time.

1291
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,558
We're gonna see each other,

1292
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:14,959
and we're never
gonna to talk again.

1293
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,594
It's your fucking loss.

1294
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:18,796
And the record company's.

1295
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:24,168
Ken, the booking office
from Leno just called..

1296
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,571
Trisha Yearwood's
appearance has been cancelled.

1297
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:29,039
Trisha Yearwood has been
booked with Leno for months.

1298
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,275
How can Helen get away
with this crap?

1299
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:33,010
Well, I'm not going to take it!

1300
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,580
Get me Robert Hilburn
at the L.A. Times.

1301
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:36,981
Brace yourself, Warren.

1302
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,849
Ken Kragen has gone
public about Helen.

1303
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,317
Holy hell is breaking loose.

1304
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,052
This is it!

1305
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:43,253
Even Jay can see

1306
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,723
she's totally out of control.

1307
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:50,060
Independent verification.

1308
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:56,000
Helen has one option.

1309
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,068
She accepts this
redefinition of duties,

1310
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,137
or she's off the show.

1311
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,607
"Can't book guests"...

1312
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,842
I don't do that already.
We have bookers for that.

1313
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,711
"Can't cancel guests"...

1314
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,278
I've never canceled a guest,

1315
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,114
no matter what the fuckin'
L.A. Times says.

1316
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,817
"Cannot talk to the media."
Well, that's a relief.

1317
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,118
Who needs that?

1318
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,853
This is no redefinition
of my duties.

1319
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,655
It's what I've been
doin' all along.

1320
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,223
And if you sign this,

1321
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:22,059
we'll hold your feet
to the flame on every issue.

1322
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:24,595
You know, when they put
John Sununu out of the White House,

1323
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:27,097
everything fell apart.

1324
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:31,168
You guys just want me to prove
I can be a good little girl, huh?

1325
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:35,039
Would any of this be pulled
with a male executive producer?

1326
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,707
Bullshit!

1327
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,309
Well, okay, I can be
a good little girl.

1328
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,646
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do?

1329
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,047
Try to control yourself, Helen.

1330
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,082
Stop fucking with me, Warren.

1331
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,383
I know what you're up to.

1332
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,085
You've made a mess of prime time.

1333
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:50,287
You know you can't measure up
to the job Brandon did!

1334
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,790
So this is all you can do
to try to save your own ass,

1335
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,191
is to come after me.

1336
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,693
Hey, Warren, did you
know they're talking to

1337
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,227
Don Ohlmeyer for your job?

1338
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,963
And Kerry McCluggage?

1339
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,798
So go fuck yourself, Warren.

1340
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:04,969
I mean, you've had a lot
of practice at that, right?

1341
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:07,371
Helen!

1342
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,843
She'll never make
it as a diplomat.

1343
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:14,311
If you love her,
get her out of here.

1344
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,881
- She needs help, Jay.
- We all need help, Warren.

1345
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,849
The numbers are still good,
isn't that what's important?

1346
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:20,417
It doesn't matter.

1347
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,919
You're approaching disaster.

1348
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,287
Helen has pushed too far.

1349
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,756
The whole town is
rising up against her.

1350
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,324
It's not as easy as you think.

1351
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,694
Helen made all this happen for me.

1352
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:32,196
Everything. You know what I
was doin' before I met Helen?

1353
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,999
You know what I was doin'? I was
workin' in strip clubs! You know?

1354
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:38,102
I wasn't gonna be on
any television show.

1355
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,005
An agent once told me
that I had a face

1356
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:42,773
that would scare small
children. Look at me.

1357
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,909
I'm the host of The Tonight Show.

1358
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:47,211
Helen Kushnick got it for me.

1359
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:49,213
And she could lose it for you, too.

1360
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,181
Great!

1361
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:56,253
17 years, you know,
is an awful long...

1362
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:00,958
Her son died of AIDS, you know.

1363
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,894
The hospital gave him a bad
transfusion. A 3-year-old baby!

1364
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:05,095
That was a terrible tragedy, Jay...

1365
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,931
Her husband got colon cancer.

1366
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,265
He died a year after that...

1367
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,967
She had a mastectomy...

1368
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,368
Jerry Kushnick on his deathbed,

1369
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,903
on his deathbed, he asked me
to take care of her.

1370
01:01:12,937 --> 01:01:14,371
I recognize you have
intense feelings about this.

1371
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,807
You have every reason to
feel loyalty to Helen,

1372
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,175
but we're past that.

1373
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,244
Now, I was a psychology
major in college,

1374
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,146
and what John and I
are doing with you now,

1375
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,048
we would have to
call an intervention.

1376
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:28,418
What you see as loyalty to
a woman who has suffered deeply,

1377
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,087
we see as a form of addiction.

1378
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,490
Now, she cannot continue to
produce a television show

1379
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,292
in this condition.

1380
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:37,728
Helen is either gonna
take you down,

1381
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:39,263
or you are going
to separate from her.

1382
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,199
But she is not going to take me down.

1383
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:45,836
She is fired.

1384
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,806
If we have to, we'll
bar her from the lot.

1385
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,016
What if I were to walk out with her?

1386
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:04,822
Well, if you can't separate
from Helen, that's a big mistake.

1387
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,791
I regret it, but we have choices to make.

1388
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:09,526
And the choice I have to make
is to tell David Letterman

1389
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,096
that it's time to take
over The Tonight Show.

1390
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:15,866
I suspect that Peter Lassally
and David could be in Burbank

1391
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,902
on 24 hours notice.

1392
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:20,905
You guys would do that to me?

1393
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:24,408
I will absolutely do that.
That's how strongly we feel.

1394
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:27,211
I need a commitment from you Jay.

1395
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,513
Will you be at work tomorrow?

1396
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:42,192
Is what you're saying is
that if I don't come to work,

1397
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:44,461
I'm gonna be fired?

1398
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,064
I'm not saying that exactly.

1399
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,866
But is that what you mean?

1400
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,968
You mean that I'm gonna be
fired if I don't show up for work?

1401
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:58,142
Jay, are you looking for
some legal justification

1402
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:00,044
for breaking with Helen?

1403
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,312
It's a simple question.
Just tell me.

1404
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,181
If I don't come to work tomorrow,

1405
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:06,951
are you gonna fire me?

1406
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,189
Yes, I guess we're saying that.

1407
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,069
You guys can let yourselves out.

1408
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:47,024
Agoglia handed this to me when I came in.

1409
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:48,492
They're firing me.

1410
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,194
I told him you'd never stand for this.

1411
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:51,528
What do you want me
to do about it, Helen?

1412
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:52,997
Issue a statement backing me.

1413
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,198
Then we just go on with the show.

1414
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,033
Just like that?

1415
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:58,002
Aren't you still fired?
Not if you don't accept it.

1416
01:03:58,035 --> 01:03:59,403
They'll never let you go.

1417
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,038
All you have to do is
threaten to quit.

1418
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,373
They'll cave. They've got no balls.

1419
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:05,142
You know what they told me?

1420
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,377
They told me they were gonna
fire me and bring in David.
That's what they told me.

1421
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:09,013
Oh, bullshit!

1422
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:11,248
These guys hate Letterman.

1423
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,051
All we gotta do is
stay strong, honey.

1424
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:16,253
No. You know? Everything is
all out of control now.

1425
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:20,057
Hey, hold it. Don't you give
me this shit too. Not you.

1426
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,227
Who the hell do you think pulled
you out of those shit-hole clubs?

1427
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,296
Who got you on television?
On Letterman?

1428
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,065
I remember.

1429
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,667
You, who wasn't blonde,
who wasn't from the midwest.

1430
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,637
15 years ago? This town?
The Carson people?

1431
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,505
They wouldn't let you
play on their field!

1432
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,174
So, I had to move the game.

1433
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,309
Sorry, assholes,
the game's over here now.

1434
01:04:39,343 --> 01:04:40,644
I moved the game!

1435
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:42,980
Who the hell do you
think forced Carson out

1436
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:45,049
so you could get the best
fuckin' job in comedy?

1437
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:47,284
Forced Carson out? Johnny quit!

1438
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,386
Sure he quit! Because he
couldn't take the heat anymore.

1439
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,288
I got the affiliates on your side.

1440
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,090
I got the network to
kiss your Italian ass.

1441
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:55,492
I got page one of the
fucking New York Post

1442
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:58,195
to bury that fossil
Carson. All for you!

1443
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,164
What do you mean you got
page one of the Post?

1444
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:01,999
You told me we didn't have
anything to do with that story.

1445
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:04,401
For Chrissake, grow up.

1446
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:06,370
You lied to me?

1447
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,273
We've always played the same game.

1448
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:11,241
You never want to know
what I'm doing for you,

1449
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:12,709
so you can be Mr. Nice Guy.

1450
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,678
"Booking war, what do I know?

1451
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,413
Helen handles that. I do the jokes."

1452
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,548
You just want me to
keep servin' you the steaks.

1453
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:21,485
You never wanna know how
I'm slaughtering the cow.

1454
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,720
I can't believe you lied to me.

1455
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,422
We needed the story. It helped us.

1456
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,623
I did it for you!

1457
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,192
I called Johnny.

1458
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,726
And I told him it
didn't come from us.

1459
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,596
Because you told me
that it didn't come from us.

1460
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:35,599
I can't believe you had me
lie to Johnny Carson.

1461
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,668
Big fucking deal!
So go to fucking confession!

1462
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,405
I got a show to do, Helen.

1463
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:46,943
Goddammit!

1464
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,051
What are you doin'?

1465
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,153
Jay, honey, let's
get this ironed out.

1466
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,322
We can work something out with NBC.

1467
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:01,458
No Helen. They want you out.
So do I.

1468
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:04,061
What about taking care
of me and my kid?

1469
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:05,629
You sat there on Jerry's deathbed.

1470
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:07,497
You said, "I'll take care of
your wife and daughter."

1471
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,233
I heard you say that!

1472
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:11,101
I did say that,
and I meant it then.

1473
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,537
But, now, Helen, you
almost cost me this job.

1474
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,306
You don't need this job.
Listen, I've been on the phone.

1475
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,575
I guarantee us a job.
25 million.

1476
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,044
We can walk out of here.

1477
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:21,745
Good-bye, Helen.

1478
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:24,614
Don't you leave me,
you two-faced bastard!

1479
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:28,052
What do you want to do?

1480
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:32,322
You wanna break this?
You wanna break this!

1481
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:34,391
It's broken.

1482
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,799
Warren Littlefield's office.

1483
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,368
Yeah, it's Jay. Is he in?

1484
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:45,802
Sure.

1485
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,271
Yeah, Warren?

1486
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,505
You gotta help me through this.

1487
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,074
Absolutely.

1488
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:51,675
You gotta help me through it.
I'm moving forward with you.

1489
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,310
- I'm doin' the show.
- <i>Great.</i>

1490
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,379
She's no longer the executive producer.

1491
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,582
I'm no longer in business
with Helen Kushnick.

1492
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:13,063
I had a wonderful time! We've got a
great show tomorrow night! Good-bye!

1493
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,281
Can you guys come in here please?

1494
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:33,617
Hey, everybody, come on in here.

1495
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,719
I just have a few things
I wanna say to everybody.

1496
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:37,621
It'll just take a few
minutes, okay? Come on.

1497
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,190
Come on in. Great show tonight.
First, I should say that...

1498
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:44,794
So I wanted to just
take a few minutes to

1499
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:47,731
apologize for all the craziness
that's been goin' on

1500
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,733
around here the past few months.

1501
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:53,203
Now, I listened to Helen,
and it was a mistake,

1502
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,504
and I shouldn't have done it,

1503
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:55,739
and I'm sorry for it.

1504
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:58,142
So, please stay with me.

1505
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,444
I'm gonna try and make it up
to each and every one of you,

1506
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,812
and let's just keep doin' the
best shows that we can do, alright?

1507
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:06,550
So to you, I thank you very much.

1508
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,352
Thank you so much.

1509
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,220
Way to go, Jay!

1510
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:12,156
We're behind you!

1511
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,341
What a place!

1512
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,876
Oh my God, there's more fruit in here!

1513
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:35,779
Is it scurvy, Mike?
Can you see it? Is it on my skin?

1514
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:38,515
Pete, have a seat, and take
that silly rug off, will ya?

1515
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,350
Now, Morty, for God's
sake, straighten your tie.

1516
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:41,551
This isn't a tractor pull!

1517
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:43,853
Alright, here we go!
Let's get this thing started.

1518
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:48,525
Well, these are summaries of all
the offers David has on the table.

1519
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,295
They're all in the same range--
12 to 14 million a year,

1520
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,230
depending on how well you do.

1521
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:55,832
We also have a couple of those
oversized syndication offers,

1522
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,401
like the 50 million
from Viacom...

1523
01:08:57,434 --> 01:09:00,370
Listen, syndication gives me the willies.

1524
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:04,841
He wants a network.

1525
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:09,246
Now, ABC passed because we wouldn't
accept midnight after "Nightline".

1526
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,847
FOX is...

1527
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,618
Well, FOX is FOX. They're about
three quarters of a network, at best.

1528
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,954
So, that leaves us with CBS.

1529
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,825
Suddenly our options are narrowed.

1530
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:25,495
Listen, the good news is, David,
that CBS has really stepped up.

1531
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,531
They're offering you 12.5,

1532
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,534
but that, of course, will escalate
as your demographics improve.

1533
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,836
Yeah, but, Mike, what did they
say about the clearance issue?

1534
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,971
I mean, look, NBC is putting
The Tonight Show on, what,

1535
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,840
99% of affiliates...

1536
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:40,410
We're only get about 65%
of the affiliates in year one.

1537
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:43,347
Howard Stringer promises
that they'll get it up to 90%

1538
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:46,316
by the end of year three,
at the very, very latest.

1539
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,818
Now, in spite of these limitations, Dave,

1540
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:52,322
I think that Stringer is an
extremely competent executive.

1541
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:54,424
And if you go to CBS,
there is no doubt

1542
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,993
you will become their
number one signature star.

1543
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,263
And I can't put a price tag on that.

1544
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:03,567
There is one problem that
we now have to deal with.

1545
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,470
And that is that NBC
still has the right

1546
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:08,372
to match this offer within 30 days.

1547
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:12,476
So, NBC matches the offer,
and I'm stuck at NBC at 12:30

1548
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:13,743
for the rest of my life!

1549
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:14,978
Not necessarily...

1550
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,616
We've come up with something extra.

1551
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:22,819
The CBS deal has a penalty clause.

1552
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,455
CBS agrees to give you a show

1553
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:27,457
that airs before
midnight Eastern time,

1554
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:29,693
or they owe you 50 million.

1555
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:33,963
- 50 million!
- Man!

1556
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:37,334
That's no penalty.
That's capital punishment.

1557
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,403
It's not even gonna faze CBS

1558
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,305
because they're giving
you 11:30 anyway.

1559
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:43,640
But it's going to make NBC choke.

1560
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,542
Cool!

1561
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:50,347
It is C.A.A.'s formal recommendation

1562
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:54,584
that you accept the CBS offer,
and so inform NBC.

1563
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,689
Congratulations, Dave.

1564
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,495
- Taxi!
- Where are you goin'?

1565
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:06,730
I got a date downtown.

1566
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,032
Really, another one? Who's left?

1567
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,070
David.

1568
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,974
You know there's still one
promise Ovitz hasn't kept.

1569
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,477
Yeah, well, maybe NBC's
happy with what they got.

1570
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:23,079
If NBC were to offer
you The Tonight Show,

1571
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,781
would you still accept it?

1572
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,983
Peter, we've had this conversation.
Of course I would.

1573
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,518
You know I want that show.

1574
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:32,288
I just wanted to
hear you say it again.

1575
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,058
Where are you goin'?

1576
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,361
Pete?

1577
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,464
David?

1578
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,432
Bob Wright is here to see you.

1579
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:43,633
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

1580
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:44,834
Hello, David!

1581
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:46,703
Heya, Bob, how are ya?

1582
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,071
Good to see ya. Thanks for comin'.

1583
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,606
Pete, why don't you come on in...

1584
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,441
I'm sorry, I have things
to do down the hall.

1585
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,777
- Thanks, Peter.
- You bet, Bob.

1586
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:58,848
Hey, Bob. Thanks for comin' on down.

1587
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,049
Oh, thank you for having me.

1588
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,818
Make yourself at home.

1589
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,753
Oh, you like that?

1590
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:05,489
Here, you want one? There you go.

1591
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,458
- Thank you.
- You own it.

1592
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:10,594
David...

1593
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:16,666
I really don't want you

1594
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,469
to leave your family here at NBC.

1595
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:24,408
I'm here because I want
desperately to prevent that.

1596
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:27,577
I wanna offer anything I can.

1597
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:31,548
Is there anything I can offer
to get you to stay?

1598
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:34,918
Well, those are warm sentiments, Bob.

1599
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,020
Thank you.

1600
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:39,889
Well, of course, you know I would stay.

1601
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:42,459
But you've already
filled your 11:30 slot.

1602
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,162
I can offer almost anything else.

1603
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,565
Prime-time, specials...

1604
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,099
I know, Bob... I know.

1605
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:53,670
It's just-- prime-time... and the...

1606
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,039
I'm a creature of late night.

1607
01:12:56,072 --> 01:13:00,009
You know? I always have been,
I mean, that's who my audience is.

1608
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,145
The guys on the west coast say

1609
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:04,981
that you may have trouble
adjusting to 11:30.

1610
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:07,584
Alright, listen.

1611
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:10,587
Those guys are entitled
to their opinion, but,

1612
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,188
I'm tellin' you I think
that they're wrong.

1613
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,990
I think that I am ready,

1614
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:15,925
and I've given a lot of thought

1615
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:18,962
to what it will take
shift to an 11:30 position.

1616
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,598
I know it's a different audience.

1617
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:25,802
And if that means booking
different types of guests,

1618
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:28,037
or country music mixed
in with the rock,

1619
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,539
or whatever it takes.

1620
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:32,008
And I can also temper my own act.

1621
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,778
I'm a professional.
I know how to do that.

1622
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:37,013
I have no doubt that you can.

1623
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,916
And I see that you have
given this a lot of thought.

1624
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:43,119
Well, I have. But, all the same,

1625
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:47,190
I just have to tell ya,
that it's time.

1626
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:51,895
I gotta move up.

1627
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:55,164
And if I don't do it now,

1628
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:57,767
I'm not ever gonna do it.

1629
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,005
It's time to move.

1630
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,943
John.

1631
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,145
Have you heard anything
new from Ovitz?

1632
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,014
Nothing new. Nothing old.

1633
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:15,049
- Lots of nothing.
- Nothing. Great.

1634
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,088
So, what's Wright saying?

1635
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,791
He says he's waitin'
to hear from Ovitz.

1636
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,259
He's leaning towards Letterman.

1637
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,662
I know. I told Jay,
west coast is behind him,

1638
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,063
but I can't speak for New York.

1639
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:29,098
You're worried about Boca?

1640
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,834
Once again, Jay and Dave

1641
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,736
are in competition
with one another.

1642
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:35,739
Now, New York likes Dave so
much they don't wanna let him go.

1643
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:38,708
Jimmy, I like Dave.
He's my friend.

1644
01:14:38,742 --> 01:14:39,943
I love this show.

1645
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:42,178
I'm not asking them to not like Dave!

1646
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,880
Why does it have to be either or?

1647
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:45,982
These network guys. You know?
They can't make up their mind.

1648
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:48,585
They think they can just flip a coin.

1649
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,687
Dave or Jay, Jay or Dave.
It doesn't matter to them.

1650
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,055
Do you think that's
what the meeting's about?

1651
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:53,590
Choosing between you and Dave?

1652
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:55,792
I don't care what
the meeting's about.

1653
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,994
I've given them everything
they've asked for.

1654
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,763
I've given them the demos.
I've given them the numbers...

1655
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,064
If I'm the one goin' down,

1656
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:04,233
I'm goin' down swingin'!

1657
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:06,202
Hey, where's Rick Ludwin?

1658
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,904
He left to be in on that
conference call from Boca.

1659
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:10,607
Guess what that's gonna be about?

1660
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,911
Hey, everyone, I'm gonna cut the
post-mortem a little short tonight.

1661
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:17,180
I got some things to do, but
it was a great show, really.

1662
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:21,050
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1663
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:23,252
And I'll see you
at the house later.

1664
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:25,789
Alright? Okay, thanks.

1665
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:56,820
Are you reading us okay?
Can you hear us?

1666
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,822
Yeah, I hear you all fine.

1667
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,892
You settled in?

1668
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:05,294
You ordered the pizza yet?

1669
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:10,266
Thanks for joining us, Rick.

1670
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:17,140
I know it's late, and we're all
tired, but we're here to discuss
and hear out everybody's opinion

1671
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:20,343
on what we should do about Late Night.

1672
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:23,112
I think this should have
been settled long before now.

1673
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:27,083
Jay has the job. He's doing
great. He has a great attitude.

1674
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,818
Whoa, wait a minute.

1675
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:31,187
I thought we were
talk this thing out.

1676
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,990
Not do self-serving commercials.

1677
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:37,093
If you want the executive
producer job that bad, Rick,

1678
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:38,895
kiss Jay's ass in private, okay?

1679
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,065
We all see the job Jay is doing.

1680
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:44,968
His selection of musical acts.

1681
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,170
Unoriginal comedy past the monologue.

1682
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,038
And his piss-poor interviewing.

1683
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,373
Which, by the way,

1684
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:52,275
looks like it will
never get any better.

1685
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:55,144
Let's talk about what we
think it would really cost us

1686
01:16:55,178 --> 01:16:58,147
to match CBS's offer for Letterman.

1687
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:59,415
And, on the other hand,

1688
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,686
if Leno quits to go to CBS,

1689
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,888
are we out from under the
10 million dollars that we'd owe him

1690
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:06,322
if we fired him?

1691
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,658
Warren, I've got some
serious concerns here.

1692
01:17:08,692 --> 01:17:10,994
I don't think you can just
throw off Jay with a couple of---

1693
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:14,898
Jack, it's very good
of you to come so late.

1694
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:16,165
Please sit.

1695
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,834
And keep talking, everybody.

1696
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:19,402
I'm just here to listen.

1697
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:21,871
Sorry it's so warm.
The air conditioning went out.

1698
01:17:21,905 --> 01:17:25,108
Warren, why don't you continue?

1699
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:29,178
My fear is that
Letterman won't cooperate.

1700
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,380
It isn't in his personality.
He'll stiff us.

1701
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:34,784
Remember, this is the guy
who kicks NBC executives

1702
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,119
out of his anniversary parties.

1703
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:39,222
- That's an old story. That is so petty.
- Excuse me. Excuse me for a minute...

1704
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,691
There's still a serious
question that his act

1705
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:42,926
can play an hour earlier.

1706
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:44,127
And a lot of us think it won't.

1707
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,361
And don't forget.

1708
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,230
With Leno, we own the show again.

1709
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,999
Letterman wants to own his show.

1710
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:52,969
Then he has all the ancillary profits.

1711
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,403
May I say something here?

1712
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,105
Jack, please, of course.

1713
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:58,241
I'm not a regular Late Night viewer,

1714
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,776
so I wouldn't presume to make a call

1715
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,410
about who's the best comedian.

1716
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,179
All I want to say is this--

1717
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:06,349
as always I'm for whatever
is the best business deal.

1718
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:09,452
That's for you, Bob, and
your people to determine.

1719
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:14,390
However, if the decision comes
down to a tie on all angles,

1720
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,794
well, I'd cast my vote for loyalty.

1721
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:22,398
Goodnight.

1722
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:26,736
Goodnight Jack. Thanks very
much for dropping by. I think
that about wraps it up, folks.

1723
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,205
We'll meet again tomorrow.

1724
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,989
Hey, Warren, it's Jay.

1725
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:47,356
How ya doin'?

1726
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,226
Hey, you know, you're
probably all tired

1727
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:52,261
from sitting through those
boring G.E. meetings all morning.

1728
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:54,130
I betcha I'm catching you
just as you're about to sit down

1729
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:55,398
on the toilet.

1730
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:59,368
That was quite a meeting
you had last night.

1731
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,771
I hope that G.E. protects
it's nuclear secrets better

1732
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:04,407
than they protect their
Late Night secrets.

1733
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,476
I thought it was too bad
to hear that Dick Ebersol

1734
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,145
was no Jay Leno fan.

1735
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,513
Although it was good to know that

1736
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,082
Jack Welch was is
in favor of loyalty.

1737
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,351
You know, as long as it came
down to a "tie on all angles."

1738
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:16,920
Holy shit, Jay!

1739
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:18,487
How the hell did you
get your information?

1740
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:20,790
Well, you know, I may look
stupid, but I'm Italian.

1741
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:22,225
I know how to find information.

1742
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:24,794
Listen, Jay, don't tell
anybody about this.

1743
01:19:24,828 --> 01:19:26,129
Warren, you don't have to worry.

1744
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:27,864
Your secrets are safe with me.

1745
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:29,799
I won't break the G.E. code.

1746
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:33,837
Listen, just have a wonderful
time in beautiful sunny Florida!

1747
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:50,319
Betty?

1748
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:53,022
We have a security leak
of enormous proportions.

1749
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:55,992
Paul Schaffer, ladies and gentlemen.

1750
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:57,360
Well, that sucked!

1751
01:19:57,393 --> 01:19:59,528
Let's see how bad we can
write tomorrow's.

1752
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:01,564
John, you have some top ten...

1753
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:05,134
Yeah, the top ten reasons
Sinead O'Connor hates the pope.

1754
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,970
No, no, no can do.

1755
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:08,437
We got a memo from NBC.

1756
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,506
Standards and practices
is rip-shit over her tearing

1757
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,275
the pope in half on
Saturday Night Live.

1758
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,609
I don't care... write the jokes.

1759
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,611
No Sinead O'Connor jokes, Dave.

1760
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,114
And now NBC's telling us what
jokes we can and can't do?

1761
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:22,285
Something in that survey
"tasty hot meal" on my desk?

1762
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:25,621
Ah, fuck.

1763
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,892
Alright, the top ten jokes
that NBC won't let us do.

1764
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:30,259
Peter liked it.
Peter liked that joke.

1765
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:31,861
Laurie, you like that joke?

1766
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:33,196
Yeah.

1767
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,398
Mike Ovitz is on line one.

1768
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,466
Alright, fellas, let's go.
I gotta take this call.

1769
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,236
Come on, it's adult swim.
Get outta here.

1770
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,471
Don't come back until it's funny.

1771
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,307
You guys wanna hear this?

1772
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,909
Oh, yeah.

1773
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:47,911
Alright, you ready?

1774
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:50,313
Hi ya Mike. How are ya?

1775
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,282
Dave, one hour ago Bob Wright
conveyed to us an offer

1776
01:20:53,316 --> 01:20:55,351
for you to host The Tonight Show.

1777
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,488
Now, don't jump to any conclusions.

1778
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,090
Let me lay all this out.

1779
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:03,993
The deal is three years with an option.

1780
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:06,996
The salary range is 7 to 12 million.

1781
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,531
Now, here's the wrinkle.

1782
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:11,634
The deal does not commence
until May of 1994.

1783
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:14,037
18 months from now.

1784
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,339
What's all that about?

1785
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,008
It's rather transparently NBC's attempt

1786
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:21,644
to keep both you and Leno,
at least for a while.

1787
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:23,312
The May date, as I understand it,

1788
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:25,414
coincides with the end
of Leno's contract

1789
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,083
as the host of The Tonight Show.

1790
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:30,987
- But I get the show?
- Yes.

1791
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,456
- I just don't get it now?
- No.

1792
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:36,159
- I get it a year from May?
- Yes.

1793
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:39,963
And they don't force Jay out?

1794
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:43,032
No, unless he quits,
which I assume that he might.

1795
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:44,333
Maybe that's what
they want him to do.

1796
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:46,169
Jay's gonna quit?

1797
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:48,271
Not a chance. Not a chance.

1798
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:50,673
Jesus, can you believe this?

1799
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:53,476
Dave, let me point
out a few more things.

1800
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:56,612
CBS is offering more salary.

1801
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,015
CBS is offering ownership.

1802
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:02,518
CBS is also offering for
the show to start in the fall.

1803
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:06,189
NBC the following
spring... maybe.

1804
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:09,125
What's that? What's maybe?

1805
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:12,361
I mean that the deal is obviously
very smoky in many details.

1806
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:13,596
But I get the show, right?

1807
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,498
No, not necessarily, David.

1808
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:19,335
The waiting period gives Jay 18
months to make the show a hit.

1809
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:24,440
And if he does, you can bet NBC will
find a way to weasel out of the deal.

1810
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:28,077
Honestly, Dave, C.A.A. sees no
reason to change its recommendation.

1811
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,278
Mike, listen.

1812
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:30,980
You don't understand.

1813
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:34,317
It is every driver's
dream to drive a Ferrari.

1814
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,152
And now you're asking me to give that up.

1815
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,487
Well, I can probably buy some time.

1816
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:40,423
The NBC deadline is Monday.

1817
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,658
I could get Agoglia in here
on Saturday and Sunday

1818
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,093
and have him start drawing up papers.

1819
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:46,162
Yes, yes. Get Agoglia in there.

1820
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,530
I'm not gonna be the only guy

1821
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,165
whose weekend is ruined by this.

1822
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,035
Have Agoglia drag his
tired ass to C.A.A.

1823
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:53,702
while I'm up in
Connecticut in hell

1824
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:57,073
trying to figure out what the
fuck I'm going to do with my life!

1825
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:00,643
Dave?

1826
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:02,478
- Dave!
- What?

1827
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:04,080
Hello, David.

1828
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:05,481
Hiya, Pete!

1829
01:23:05,514 --> 01:23:09,585
Welcome to my weekend in hell!

1830
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:12,155
- No movement since Friday?
- No.

1831
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:15,058
And Agoglia's not puttin'
anything in writing.

1832
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:20,363
Ovitz says NBC can't take the risk

1833
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:22,098
that it'll leak.

1834
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:25,401
And Jay will figure out that
they offered his job to me.

1835
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:29,172
Can you imagine if the
press heard about this?

1836
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:35,511
Do you think Jay knows?

1837
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:38,214
No. How can he?

1838
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:41,084
But, David, it is worth thinking
about what it will mean to Jay

1839
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:42,385
if you take this.

1840
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:45,288
It means that you will be
denounced in the press

1841
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:47,323
for shoving an old
friend under a train.

1842
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:52,361
Jeez. I mean, that's horrible.

1843
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:54,397
I can't worry about that.

1844
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,199
Have you talked to anybody else?

1845
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:57,466
Yeah, I talked to everybody.

1846
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,568
I talked to Hal, Morty, Rob, Jude...

1847
01:23:59,602 --> 01:24:01,204
And what did they say?

1848
01:24:01,237 --> 01:24:04,207
They all said the same thing.
It's a shitty deal.

1849
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,176
CBS offered a better one.

1850
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,814
I tell ya, Pete.

1851
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:13,649
I'm still thinking of taking it.

1852
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:15,618
- I want that show.
- What show?

1853
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,653
- I deserve that show!
- Johnny's show?

1854
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:19,755
Don't you get it, David?

1855
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:22,791
They are not offering you the
"Johnny Carson Tonight Show."

1856
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:24,793
That is gone forever.

1857
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:26,795
They're offering you damaged goods.

1858
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:29,565
They're offering you the Jay Leno show.

1859
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:31,367
And they're not even
offering it now.

1860
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,768
They're making you wait.

1861
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,703
I lost that show once, Pete.
I'm not gonna do it again.

1862
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,805
I can't-- I just can't say no.

1863
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:39,775
Then don't say yes yet.
Make one more phone call.

1864
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,345
Why are you doing this to me?

1865
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:44,747
Don't you understand? I don't care.

1866
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,616
I cannot lose The Tonight Show twice.

1867
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,418
Once to Jay Leno...

1868
01:24:49,452 --> 01:24:51,887
And once because I was too dumb
to take a second chance.

1869
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,789
They're offering me
a second chance, Pete!

1870
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,524
David, you don't understand.

1871
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:57,760
I am the guy that moved
heaven and earth

1872
01:24:57,793 --> 01:24:59,662
to get you that second chance.

1873
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:02,565
And I'm tellin' ya, it's not right.

1874
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,134
It's leftovers. It's shoddy.

1875
01:25:05,168 --> 01:25:08,204
Call the one guy in all the world

1876
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:11,707
who can help you figure this out.

1877
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:23,619
Hello.

1878
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,321
Uh, Johnny. It's Dave.

1879
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:30,359
I hate to bother you on
a Sunday like this, but...

1880
01:25:30,393 --> 01:25:31,894
I know why you're calling, Dave.

1881
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:34,463
Peter filled me in on the NBC offer.

1882
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:38,767
Listen, I just hate to put you
on the spot like this.

1883
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,338
But, you may be the only guy

1884
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:44,840
who really understands
this sort of thing, and I...

1885
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,609
What do you think?

1886
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,944
I think you gotta do
what's best for your career.

1887
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,480
I mean, do what's in your heart.

1888
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:54,517
Johnny, it's just those two things

1889
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,553
seem to be in direct conflict.

1890
01:25:57,586 --> 01:25:59,855
It's just so tough!

1891
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:06,962
I just have to ask you
straight out, Johnny.

1892
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,764
What would you do?

1893
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:10,666
Well, Dave, I would probably walk.

1894
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:12,568
Now, I'm not telling you to do that.

1895
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:15,238
But if you're asking
me what I would do

1896
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:17,740
if I was treated like this. Yeah.

1897
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:21,244
I would probably walk.

1898
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:24,247
Yeah, I imagine you would, Johnny.

1899
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,350
Listen, I just really appreciate this.

1900
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:29,952
It's just awfully nice of you.

1901
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:33,856
Thanks.

1902
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:36,325
Good luck, Dave.

1903
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,835
Everyone here wants to know
what's going on in Late Night.

1904
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:48,771
And the answer is...

1905
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:54,577
the host of The Tonight Show
will continue to be Jay Leno!

1906
01:27:02,585 --> 01:27:03,886
How ya'll doin'?

1907
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:06,489
Don't let these NBC guys
out of your sight!

1908
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:08,424
Oh, hi ya, Warren. How are ya?

1909
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:09,992
Welcome to NBC,

1910
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:12,895
which stands for--
Never Believe Your Contract!

1911
01:27:14,797 --> 01:27:19,034
They say that we live in
a time of lowered expectations.

1912
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,970
They must be right,
because look at this.

1913
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:25,408
You're all here, and I have the job.

1914
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:28,477
What we're celebrating is
that I haven't been fired!

1915
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:32,881
Okay. Let's go.

1916
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:35,684
It's our turn now.

1917
01:28:36,745 --> 01:28:39,014
Hold it.

1918
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:44,319
Gentlemen, we are just going from
one bizarre circumstance to the next.

1919
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:49,925
I never dated Amy Fisher.

1920
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:53,862
I helped her with her homework.
I fixed her car.

1921
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:56,131
And that's it! Thank you, and goodnight.

1922
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,000
What about Paul Shaffer?
Is he coming along?

1923
01:28:58,033 --> 01:28:59,602
- Paul who?
- Paul Shaffer.

1924
01:28:59,635 --> 01:29:00,903
Oh, Paul Shaffer!

1925
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:04,473
Oh, no, God! We forgot about Paul!

1926
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,375
Howard, is there just

1927
01:29:06,409 --> 01:29:08,777
a little bit left over for Paul Shaffer?

1928
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:12,381
Dave? Dave. Are you
gonna kick Jay Leno's ass?

1929
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:14,417
I'm gonna kick your ass, buddy!

1930
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,851
Is your comedy too hip for 11:30?

1931
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:18,554
Well, you people seem
to be keeping up.

1932
01:29:18,587 --> 01:29:21,690
Do you realize what
we've got riding on Jay Leno?

1933
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:24,893
A whole lotta money and my ass.

1934
01:29:24,927 --> 01:29:27,663
Dave's really good.

1935
01:29:29,532 --> 01:29:32,401
