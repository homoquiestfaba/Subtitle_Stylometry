2
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,945
It was in the fall of 1932...

3
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:49,498
... when I discovered that a copy
of the fabled Necronomicon...

4
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:51,761
... was here, in America, being...

5
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:57,081
... guarded by a clandestine
order of Om Yati monks.

6
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:02,548
Obtaining this legendary
tome was vital ...

7
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:04,437
... not only to my writings...

8
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,399
... but to the fate
of all mankind.

9
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:15,407
- Wait for me.
- As you wish, Sir.

10
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,638
For within the pages
of the Necronomicon...

11
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,690
... lie the very secrets of the universe.

12
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:24,764
Both past,
and future.

13
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:29,225
- Yes?
- Yes, I have an appointment.

14
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,821
Howard P. Lovecraft.

15
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,884
Mr. Lovecraft...

16
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:55,845
... always a treat.

17
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,849
And how can we indulge
you this time?

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
Mr. Lovecraft!

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,318
Actually I'm here because a new story
of mine demands a bit of fact checking.

20
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,125
Fact checking?

21
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:14,130
We were under the impression
you dealt in fiction.

22
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:19,001
My work is wrongly construed as
fiction by the lesser minded.

23
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:23,062
In fact I take great pride in
presenting fictional possibilities.

24
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,456
It's my duty, after all,
as a human being...

25
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:30,576
... to enlighten the darkest
depths of experience...

26
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:33,130
... to expose certain
secrets...

27
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,591
... unjustly hoarded by others.

28
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,108
We shall see.

29
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:42,063
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,646
Ah, No no. It's the uh, ...

31
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:51,825
... alchemical Encyclopedia.

32
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,611
You didn't say which volume.

33
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:59,615
Oh, which volume?
It's volume three, of course.

34
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,911
Please try to remember, ...

35
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:14,272
... that if you leave this area, unattended,
for any reason whatsoever...

36
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:17,551
... we will be forced
to revoke your privileges.

37
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,985
Yes, yes of course.

38
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:13,716
The Necronomicon!

39
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,562
"The Drowned".

40
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:32,006
Today, ...

41
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:37,843
... the last descendant of the
De Lapoer line returned from Sweden.

42
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:58,290
Not only to claim title to the crumbling
remains of the family estate...

43
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:02,525
... but also to escape his own
haunted memories.

44
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,545
As soon as I read the will,
I had to come.

45
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:25,548
Havealooksea,
is really, a very strange place.

46
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,552
Interesting.

47
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,816
The hotel is not in
very good condition.

48
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:39,438
The uncle died about 60 years ago
and since then, it stayed empty.

49
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,608
Sixty years?

50
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,613
Yes! I wasn't even in charge
of the original inheritance.

51
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,901
Well things apparently dragged on and ...

52
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,390
... I inherited this case, along with,...

53
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,371
... my fathers practice.

54
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,580
Thanks.

55
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:00,583
Your welcome.

56
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:25,134
Anyway the important thing
is that we found you.

57
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:29,570
And it was a real bitch tracking
you down over in Sweden.

58
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,574
But then we were looking for a Delapoer,
not a De Lapoer.

59
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,576
I didn't change my name.

60
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:39,538
De Lapoer is the original spelling
and pronunciation.

61
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,594
Good lord!

62
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,596
You know, you could have
broken your neck!

63
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,599
Yes, how tragic.

64
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:02,561
I told you, the wallpaper's the only
thing holding this old, place together.

65
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:07,525
Better off, having the
whole place, demolished.

66
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,218
We made it.

67
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,816
And we were here before...

68
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:17,816
...I mean my clerk and me,
he's a law student...

69
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,467
... we didn't have any
trouble with the stairs...

70
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:22,034
... I don't think this hotel likes you.

71
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,583
You came here with your clerk?

72
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,086
Well, it isn't the kind of place
a girl likes to play alone in.

73
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:29,839
Besides, we were dying to
have a look at the hotel...

74
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,591
... after hearing all the stories,
from the old folk, in the village.

75
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:36,085
Kevin, that's his name, Kevin.

76
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,598
He's from these parts and...

77
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,374
... the hotel has one hell of a reputation.

78
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,572
That's the sound of water.

79
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:59,715
The ground under the hotel
is honeycombed with caves,...

80
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:03,184
... hollowed out by water
flowing in from the sea.

81
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:08,127
One day, the whole place is going to
crumble right down into them.

82
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,444
I tell you Edward,...

83
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:14,400
... maybe you should sell, 
this land is going to be worthless.

84
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,607
Quite a bed, isn't it?

85
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:31,953
So ah,...

86
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,256
... what were we talking about?

87
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:38,295
We were talking about
the effect this hotel,...

88
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:39,661
... had on your young clerk.

89
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,430
Right.

90
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:46,553
It's like, something out of a
Gothic, romance isn't it?

91
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,294
Who's that?

92
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,879
Hmm, you wouldn't know.

93
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:05,600
That's Emma De Lapoer, your aunt.

94
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,104
She died quite young, quite tragically.

95
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,606
Drowned in a shipwreck.

96
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:14,611
Lot of gossip, about the hotel,
started at that time.

97
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,614
Jethro De Lapoer was never
the same afterword.

98
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:22,576
He followed her to the grave,
just a few days after the tragedy.

99
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,579
How did he die?

100
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:32,586
They found him below their balcony,
from what I heard.

101
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:11,114
Clara!

102
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:47,094
No one knows if he,
he fell or what happened.

103
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,613
To bad crabs
can't talk.

104
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,668
Just a minute, I have
something for you.

105
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:58,439
It, came with the will.

106
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:02,182
I think it's from
Jethro De Lapoer himself.

107
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:07,100
Would you, at least think about
what I told you, Edward?

108
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:12,561
Sell the property, or turn it
into something more, upbeat.

109
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:17,566
The only thing living in the hotel
is a lot of ugly memories.

110
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,570
Good bye, Miss Gelmore.

111
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:12,580
Sixty years.

112
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:26,594
I am writing under appreciable strain...

113
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,597
... since by tonight,
I shall be no more.

114
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,600
I can bear my pain no longer.

115
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:35,603
And shall cast  myself
from this window...

116
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:38,106
... unto the razor
like reefs below...

117
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:41,159
... sharpened by thousands of storms.

118
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,533
If I can't find redemption...

119
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:46,010
... at least it'll be oblivion.

120
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:50,618
It all happened when I returned
from a long tiring voyage.

121
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:52,638
My wife Emma,...

122
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,520
... my 8 year old son, Yon came with me.

123
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,626
They were my pride.

124
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:02,782
After weeks at sea we were finally back,...

125
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:06,908
... the New England coast was in sight
when the storm took us by surprise.

126
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:09,594
In less time than it takes
to write these words...

127
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:12,598
... our ship was driven onto the
rocks at the foot of the cliffs,...

128
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,971
... we'd been watching for days.

129
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,309
It took hours for
help to reach us.

130
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,606
By God, this ones alive!

131
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,608
He's alive!

132
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,568
My God!

133
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:38,582
There, there.

134
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,272
My wife.

135
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,498
My wife, my son.

136
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,802
Calm down Jethro,
ya got a high fever.

137
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,504
That's right.

138
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,930
What are you doing?

139
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,731
Don't move,
we half to let all the fog blood out.

140
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:11,641
Oh no!

141
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,162
Why?

142
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,571
Why!?

143
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,831
Be known by all,
from here forth...

144
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,920
... that any God, takes from me,...

145
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:20,703
... my only love in tragedy!,...

146
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:25,606
... is no longer welcome in my house!

147
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,042
Get out!

148
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:29,332
Be gone!

149
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,571
Leave!

150
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,574
May God save your souls!

151
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,527
Who are you?
What do you want?

152
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,318
I don't wanna see anyone,
go away!

153
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:31,547
In this time of need...

154
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,550
... you are...

155
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,554
... not alone.

156
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,602
Wait...

157
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:46,604
...wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

158
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,564
Wait!

159
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:37,571
"Towards the Remedy
 of Untimely Loss"

160
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:46,375
There is no death,
which can be eternal lie.

161
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:50,711
And with strange aeons,
even death can die.

162
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:53,739
In his lair, Cthulhu waits dreaming.

163
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:58,871
That which is not dead,
can eternal lie...

164
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,205
... and with strange aeons
even death may die...

165
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:08,000
In his lair,
Cthulhu waits dreaming.

166
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:11,605
Yet he's not dead
which can eternal lie...

167
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:13,948
... and with strange aeons...

168
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:16,337
... even death can die...

169
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:20,852
... In his lair,
Cthulhu waits dreaming.

170
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:02,573
Daddy...

171
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,578
Yon!

172
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,583
My son...

173
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,359
Jethro?

174
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:29,641
Emma!

175
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:32,645
You've come back!

176
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,605
How you could leave
us down there?

177
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:37,608
Jethro?

178
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,611
Please help mommy.

179
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,614
My son!

180
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:52,464
- I'm cold.
- Come here, my son.

181
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,626
Help me papa.

182
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:26,090
I don't know who will
read these words.

183
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:30,699
You should only know that there
is no magic cure for guilt.

184
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,716
Except forgiveness.

185
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,128
At last I can rest peacefully...

186
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:41,630
... knowing that my beloved...

187
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,632
... guards the book.

188
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:45,593
Oh! Damn it!

189
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,396
Damn!

190
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,583
My...

191
00:24:43,627 --> 00:24:47,590
... loved beings...

192
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:52,595
... watches...

193
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:56,599
... the book.

194
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:03,564
My beloved...

195
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:07,526
... cursed the book.

196
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,603
But he's not dead,
which can eternal die.

197
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:28,566
And with strange aeons,
even death may die.

198
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:32,611
In his lair, Cthulhu...

199
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:34,613
... waits...

200
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:36,574
... dreaming.

201
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:12,568
Who's there?

202
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:14,528
Eddie...

203
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,573
No, It can't...

204
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,533
Eddie...

205
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:22,536
- it's not possible.
- Please.

206
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:26,540
Say I can come in.

207
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,544
Come in, Clara.

208
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:50,169
I have so many
things to tell you.

209
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,569
The accident...

210
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:58,572
... it was all my fault...

211
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:01,575
... my fault.

212
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,124
I should have been looking
where I was driving!

213
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:19,552
I'm so sorry, Clara!

214
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:25,342
Please forgive me!

215
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:46,579
I'm so sorry, Clara!

216
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:08,517
Clara, listen to me.

217
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,563
Clara.

218
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:16,525
I'm tired of blowing
bubbles, Eddie dear.

219
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:40,831
Don't push me away!

220
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:53,364
Come back to us, Eddie!

221
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:45,628
Will he truly be brainless
enough to try?

222
00:33:45,628 --> 00:33:48,589
Of course, he's human.

223
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:16,617
In the midst of this
cruel heat wave...

224
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:21,081
... the inhabitants of Boston,
curse her unbearable lot...

225
00:34:21,415 --> 00:34:24,296
... while one man alone remains cool...

226
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:27,805
... cool but imprisoned by his own...

227
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:30,589
... desperate devices.

228
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:10,546
Amy Osterman, right?

229
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:12,294
Can I help you?

230
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,594
Sure you can help me, but I think
this more about helping yourself.

231
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,008
I don't understand.

232
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah well, I didn't understand either
how 11 bodies...

233
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:24,604
... could turn up, over the last 40
years in this neighborhood...

234
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:27,608
... all with the same M.O.
and go unsolved.

235
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:30,045
- Are you a police man?
- Shit,...

236
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:33,983
Do I look like a cop?

237
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:39,265
Porkel, Dale Porkel, I'm a reporter
for the Boston Journal.

238
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:43,579
Mother, we have a
guest for tea.

239
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:47,583
What are you storing in here, meat?

240
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,905
I have a rare disease,
Mr. Porkel.

241
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:53,492
I'm acutely sensitive to
heat, and sunlight.

242
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:57,635
Great, I hope it's not contagious.

243
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,637
Hardly.

244
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,667
So listen Miss Osterman,
I did some digging,...

245
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:06,592
... and the deed on this place is executed
under Dr. Richard Maddens name,...

246
00:36:06,593 --> 00:36:08,649
... and that was some 80 years ago.

247
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:11,524
Thank you, mother.

248
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:16,570
According to a, state files...

249
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,071
... there is no record of
Dr. Richard Madden's death...

250
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,455
... which would mean that
he is still alive.

251
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:25,538
Sugar?

252
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:28,323
Yeah.

253
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:33,587
So, what the hell
happened to Madden?

254
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:37,382
I really don't know what
happened to Dr. Madden.

255
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:42,749
You know, maybe you don't
understand me here lady.

256
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:47,302
You cough up the truth now...

257
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:50,413
... or I print my story as is.

258
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:53,378
And you get to deal with the cops.

259
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:58,189
Are you threatening me, Mr. Porkel?

260
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,358
If that's what it takes, yeah.

261
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:13,487
22 years ago,

262
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:16,551
... my mother came to Boston
to study the flute.

263
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:20,567
Had she not rented
a room in this building...

264
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:24,555
... all our lives would
be very different.

265
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,582
What do you want?

266
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,588
Are you alone?

267
00:37:58,631 --> 00:38:03,511
Yes, I just moved to Boston,
I don't know anyone.

268
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:19,568
My mother rented a
room in this house...

269
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:22,372
... from a woman named
Lena Kamen.

270
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:26,238
Apparently, Lena
lived here alone...

271
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:32,047
... except for a mysterious tenant,
upstairs on the third floor.

272
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,583
Who's upstairs?

273
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,071
You must never disturb Dr. Madden.

274
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:38,547
Is that quite clear?

275
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,549
All right.

276
00:40:44,218 --> 00:40:45,960
Well if it isn't little Miss runaway...

277
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:50,348
... I do believe it's time for you to
get your little butt back home.

278
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:54,610
I'm not coming home, ever again.

279
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:57,632
Really? Well I think father knows
better in these matters.

280
00:40:57,632 --> 00:40:59,177
You're not my father, Sam.

281
00:40:59,178 --> 00:41:02,390
But I love you,
like your my own kind.

282
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:05,568
And I believe I'm entitled
to a little affection...

283
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:08,571
... mother's passed out and, bloated.

284
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:12,924
I will die, before I let
you touch me again!

285
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:14,629
Who said anything about
touching me?

286
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,136
I, just came by to watch you
practice your flute playing only,...

287
00:41:18,649 --> 00:41:21,825
... your gonna practice,
on my instrument.

288
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:33,596
You little bitch!
Come back here!

289
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,612
Please, please...

290
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,129
... careful.

291
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:38,619
Sudden movements,
will impair your equilibrium.

292
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:41,422
Sam?
Where is Sam?

293
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,624
He's gone.

294
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:45,626
He's my stepfather.

295
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:50,589
I have a, strong feeling that Sam
won't be bothering you any more.

296
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:55,512
I'm, doctor Madden.

297
00:42:55,956 --> 00:43:01,124
I saw some, ammonia, or something,
leaking from my ceiling.

298
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,049
I apologize for that.

299
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:08,990
And, as for that cold your getting...

300
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:12,493
... I've asked Lena to,
give you some vitamin C...

301
00:43:12,494 --> 00:43:14,454
... with your medication tonight.

302
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:19,577
Trust me that this, frigid
temperature is not by choice.

303
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:24,623
I'm afflicted by a,
rare skin condition...

304
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:29,587
... which, requires,
an unreasonably cold environment.

305
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:37,702
Well, we better get you out of here,
before you die of cold.

306
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,036
How can I ever thank you, doctor...

307
00:43:41,174 --> 00:43:43,601
... your taking care of me, and...

308
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:46,630
Just, there is just one thing...

309
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:49,538
... don't be a stranger.

310
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:08,584
These pills...

311
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,544
Doctor knows best.

312
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,544
He's moving to much.

313
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:13,566
I'm trying to hold him still.

314
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,612
Is the temperature burning?

315
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:21,993
The temperature is steady...
...at 34.

316
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:25,155
Put another syringe in.

317
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:01,655
I heard drilling noises last night.

318
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:03,574
You were probably dreaming.

319
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:06,577
It's one of the side effects
of the medication.

320
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:09,863
Now your going to have
a little scar,...

321
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:13,670
... that's going to be covered
by your lovely hair.

322
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:20,549
Are you alright, doctor?

323
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,554
Best to get some rest, Emily.

324
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:28,557
It's a very good idea.

325
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:42,571
My mother went to look for a job,
at Al's diner across the street.

326
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:48,097
But when she mentioned she was
living with Lena and Dr. Madden...

327
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:50,425
... Al, seemed surprised.

328
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,623
Is that old coot still alive?

329
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:55,387
I'm no good with math...

330
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:58,000
... but I would have guessed him
at more than a 100 by now.

331
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,590
I don't think so.

332
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,509
Listen, Emily?

333
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:09,557
If you can get a good tip,
out of those cops...

334
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:11,517
... you've got yourself a job.

335
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:19,567
May I help you?

336
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:23,571
Yeah, I'll take the BLT,
extra mayo and a soda.

337
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,532
I'll have the same,
make mine a malt, please.

338
00:47:29,577 --> 00:47:31,537
What happened to him?

339
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:40,546
Is there a problem?

340
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:43,006
I don't know.

341
00:47:46,094 --> 00:47:47,676
What happened to Sam?

342
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,848
You did something to him, didn't you?

343
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:52,755
What makes you think that?

344
00:47:53,963 --> 00:47:57,816
I heard terrible noises last night,
you said I was dreaming, but I wasn't!

345
00:47:57,817 --> 00:47:59,429
Was I, was I!?

346
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,428
Emily, please, I'm not a rich man...

347
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:05,550
... my researches have drained my,
funds to the point of poverty...

348
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:08,218
... and when a specimen
can be obtained freely...

349
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,181
- No!
- I, make no excuses for my actions.

350
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,990
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

351
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:19,585
Your stepfather...

352
00:48:19,585 --> 00:48:21,545
Emily!

353
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,130
Emily.

354
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:31,613
 Emily, even if Sam 
did survive the fall...

355
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:33,793
...I would have killed him
for what he did to you.

356
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,604
So if you must go to the police,
you do have every right.

357
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:42,573
I don't care what you did to Sam,
but you lied to me.

358
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:44,831
No, no, never.  I would
never hurt to you, Emily.

359
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:48,614
- Doctor!, Doctor what's wrong?
- Get Lena.

360
00:48:48,614 --> 00:48:50,616
She went out, she's gone.

361
00:48:50,616 --> 00:48:52,618
Doctor, what's wrong?

362
00:48:52,618 --> 00:48:54,620
It's cooler upstairs.

363
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,736
What I can do?

364
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:58,582
Ice, I need ice.

365
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,527
Give me your hand.

366
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:36,537
I can feel now.

367
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:41,168
I owe you, an explanation.

368
00:49:45,923 --> 00:49:51,114
Within these pages,
is the secret of preserving life.

369
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:54,449
Are you familiar with the,
water bear?

370
00:49:55,697 --> 00:49:59,699
It's a microorganism which can be dried
under certain conditions then,...

371
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,606
... brought back to life with water.

372
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,621
A process called "criptobiosis".

373
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:07,089
You see the...

374
00:50:07,194 --> 00:50:11,101
... decreased body temperature results
in the secession of aging...

375
00:50:11,614 --> 00:50:18,053
... make it possible to actually,
cheat death.  As it were.

376
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:21,582
How old are you, Dr. Madden?

377
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:27,282
I don't come out
here much anymore.

378
00:50:27,678 --> 00:50:30,630
Lena, bless her heart,
simply won't allow it.

379
00:50:30,776 --> 00:50:33,594
Lena's very protective
over you.

380
00:50:34,637 --> 00:50:36,639
Are you in love with her?

381
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:41,647
My heart has been given over
to my work, unconditionally.

382
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:45,121
I don't know why Lena stays on.

383
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:49,610
I can, never return the
feeling she has for me.

384
00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:53,614
Like, all children of nature...

385
00:50:54,657 --> 00:50:59,453
... this rose was destined
to wither and parish.

386
00:51:01,303 --> 00:51:03,582
And yet that process is not irrevocable.

387
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:30,609
As it turns out, the trick is
not preserving life...

388
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:35,036
... the trick is, maintaining the quality
to which one is accustomed.

389
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:38,407
As long as you keep
this from the sun...

390
00:51:40,676 --> 00:51:42,621
... this flower will never die.

391
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,667
So this will always be a
reminder of the doctor...

392
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:49,629
... whose heart you
brought into bloom.

393
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:53,632
You're so cold.

394
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:58,098
I can ether use this on you...

395
00:52:58,098 --> 00:53:00,582
... or on myself.

396
00:53:00,658 --> 00:53:04,050
All I ever wanted, was just
love him, pookie.

397
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:07,226
If you're not willing to die for him...

398
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,454
... or kill for him...

399
00:53:11,553 --> 00:53:13,495
... you will kill him.

400
00:53:25,226 --> 00:53:28,675
Obviously, their relationship
wasn't meant to be...

401
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:31,191
... but that didn't
make any easier.

402
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:35,820
You see, Dr. Madden
was the first man...

403
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,282
... my mother ever loved.

404
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:41,241
So what?
She left him?

405
00:53:41,242 --> 00:53:43,244
Yes.

406
00:53:43,244 --> 00:53:45,205
But months later...

407
00:53:46,697 --> 00:53:49,209
... she had to go back.

408
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:06,689
- Let me out of here!
- We have to kill him!

409
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,188
No.

410
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:13,733
What the hell your doing!?

411
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:16,194
Your both crazy!

412
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,439
No!

413
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:22,200
Get away from me!

414
00:54:27,715 --> 00:54:29,675
I know, come on Al!

415
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,719
I just came over, to see...

416
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:34,721
... what ever happened to you...

417
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:37,724
... and somebody,
knocked me on the head.

418
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,684
Okay, come on.

419
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:44,731
- Al!
- She knows too much!

420
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,763
She can't be trusted, Richard.

421
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:49,736
She ran away once,
and she'll run away again.

422
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:51,738
- She'll go to the police!
- No!

423
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:54,649
We can't let her go, ever!

424
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:57,744
- No!
- It's the only way, Richard!

425
00:54:57,744 --> 00:54:59,704
No!

426
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:20,839
No, there is no other way.

427
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:24,687
Without fresh spinal fluid...

428
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:27,690
... I lose my senses.

429
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:30,329
I smell nothing.

430
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:32,654
And taste nothing.

431
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:38,211
I can't even feel you.

432
00:55:38,212 --> 00:55:39,662
No sir.

433
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:17,657
Richard!

434
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,673
Em - i - ly.

435
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:53,693
I'm pregnant...

436
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,696
... with his baby.

437
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,682
Lena saved my mother...

438
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:08,662
... but only because she knew
the baby was Richard's.

439
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:11,628
His last legacy.

440
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:13,630
The baby born was me.

441
00:57:16,403 --> 00:57:20,163
So your telling me that
Richard Madden, and Lena Kamen...

442
00:57:20,164 --> 00:57:21,505
... killed all those people...

443
00:57:23,493 --> 00:57:25,341
... for their spinal fluid?

444
00:57:26,684 --> 00:57:28,815
Then how come 3 more bodies...

445
00:57:28,815 --> 00:57:31,239
... turned up all with the same M.O.,...

446
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,652
... after Madden melted?
- I cannot answer that.

447
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:42,700
You know, you tell this story,
pretty well Miss. Osterman.

448
00:57:43,537 --> 00:57:45,544
Almost like it happened to you.

449
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,497
My mother and I were very close.

450
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:53,451
Well I have this, sick hunch...

451
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:56,225
... that you, and your mother,
are the same person.

452
00:57:57,064 --> 00:58:00,790
That would be impossible
Mr. Porkel, now wouldn't it?

453
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:03,937
Not if you picked up
this strange disease...

454
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:05,341
... when you slept with Madden.

455
00:58:05,341 --> 00:58:09,603
I mean, you said it yourself,
you didn't seem to age.

456
00:58:14,649 --> 00:58:16,609
Your right, Mr. Porkel.

457
00:58:19,654 --> 00:58:21,614
I am Emily.

458
00:58:27,266 --> 00:58:29,664
The disease which
afflicted Dr. Madden...

459
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:31,667
... and now afflicts me...

460
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:34,629
... is nothing more
than death itself.

461
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:40,675
I did not survive that gunshot.

462
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,280
But life goes on.

463
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,974
You, you fucking drugged me!

464
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:54,188
Unfortunately, the air
conditioning unit...

465
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:57,191
... in this building is old,
and prone to break down...

466
00:58:57,191 --> 00:58:59,323
... on hot days such as this one.

467
00:58:59,323 --> 00:59:01,587
So rather than wait
for an emergency...

468
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:03,663
... I prefer to keep well stocked.

469
00:59:03,663 --> 00:59:09,120
I need spinal fluid to feel
the baby inside me!

470
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:16,168
You see, for years this
baby lay inside me...

471
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:18,170
... kicking, but never born.

472
00:59:18,576 --> 00:59:21,132
All we can do is hope.

473
00:59:21,344 --> 00:59:23,860
Isn't that right, Lena.

474
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,459
That's right, Emily

475
01:00:55,205 --> 01:00:57,213
The inner city wasteland,...

476
01:00:57,214 --> 01:01:01,418
... once home to Philadelphia's
finest, and most God fearing...

477
01:01:01,439 --> 01:01:05,446
... is now Mordred over
by a self styled God.

478
01:01:05,447 --> 01:01:08,408
A miscreate known
as "the butcher".

479
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:11,996
God damn it Sarah,
slow down!

480
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:14,218
What the hell you trying
to prove anyway?

481
01:01:14,218 --> 01:01:17,260
Not trying to prove anything,
I'm pursuing a suspect.

482
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:22,461
That's bull shit!
Now pull over!

483
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:24,892
Look, don't bring
the burglar in it...

484
01:01:24,893 --> 01:01:26,522
... we both got to
much at stake here.

485
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,309
This is 2-Carl-9 heading
east on seventh street...

486
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,610
... a gray Nova,
license plate, YEU169.

487
01:01:37,245 --> 01:01:38,253
Damn it!

488
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:41,480
Suspect is driving reckless,
and refuses to listen to reason.

489
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:43,650
Request air support!
Over!

490
01:01:44,393 --> 01:01:45,719
Okay, God damn it.

491
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,880
There!
You wanna hurt me!?

492
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,177
Slam on your breaks, smash
bang, the Fuckin' dashboard!

493
01:01:52,177 --> 01:01:54,944
But don't, play with me, Sarah!

494
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,491
I know we shouldn't have
slept together, okay?

495
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:04,382
Want me to quit? I'll quit.
Want me to leave? I will leave!

496
01:02:05,173 --> 01:02:06,957
But I'm not gonna let
you hurt yourself!

497
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,142
I'm scared, Paul.

498
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:14,144
I'm scared to be a mother.

499
01:02:27,287 --> 01:02:28,616
Sarah!

500
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:31,292
Sarah!

501
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,240
Paul? Paul?

502
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,128
Paul?

503
01:03:49,922 --> 01:03:52,883
This is 2-Carl-9.
I'm at seventh and Crimson...

504
01:03:52,883 --> 01:03:56,231
... requesting back-up and
medical asap, over.

505
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:03,811
Repeat, requesting back-up and
medical asap, do you copy?

506
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:07,856
Shit!

507
01:05:40,908 --> 01:05:42,868
Stop!

508
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:28,277
Help, Sarah!

509
01:06:29,137 --> 01:06:31,668
No!

510
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:14,835
- Oh boy!
- I'm a police officer!

511
01:07:14,835 --> 01:07:16,837
Now get over there, now!

512
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:20,341
What the hell have you
done with my partner?

513
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:23,803
You followed the gray Nova
down here, am I right?

514
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:27,539
That's where it usually started--
yeah.

515
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:30,843
Never seen um catch a
cop before though.

516
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:34,717
That wasn't you driving
that gray Nova?

517
01:07:35,339 --> 01:07:38,775
Well a, I'm a Cadillac man myself.

518
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:40,299
Don't fuck with me!

519
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:44,116
The man your probably
looking for, is the Butcher.

520
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,732
Where can I find this Butcher?

521
01:07:47,254 --> 01:07:51,501
Well technically he's supposed to pay me rent,
cause I own this building top to bottom.

522
01:07:52,873 --> 01:07:56,322
You own this building,
open the door, now!

523
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,335
Lost all the keys.

524
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:02,008
Strangest thing.

525
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:06,260
This building, has a bad habit of, swallowing
things up just like they never existed.

526
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:09,414
I wanna get down below!
I wanna get down now!

527
01:08:09,516 --> 01:08:11,780
Well why didn't you say so?

528
01:08:24,864 --> 01:08:26,824
Move it.

529
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:39,879
Hold it, hold your fire!

530
01:08:39,879 --> 01:08:43,754
Harold! That you Harold?
Oh Harold what's goin' on?

531
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:46,395
First!, you just about
shot a police officer!

532
01:08:46,396 --> 01:08:48,624
I'm sorry dear, but I
thought it was him.

533
01:08:48,888 --> 01:08:51,891
Some how that skunks
gettin' out, Harold.

534
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:54,894
The Butcher?
Where's he getting out?

535
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:57,839
Don't you worry Daisy.
I called the cops...

536
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,858
... we got a fine officer on the case,
although she doesn't have a badge.

537
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,778
Fine officer in deed.

538
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,822
Smells very pretty.

539
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:08,824
Pretty is fine.

540
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:10,785
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

541
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,844
Now be careful with this floor girl, looks like 
the missus just mopped up around here.

542
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:32,848
Don't want you slipin', and
slappin' a law suit on us too.

543
01:09:32,848 --> 01:09:34,850
Show me where he's getting out.

544
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,811
Over here.

545
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,679
There's a tunnel in there.

546
01:09:41,508 --> 01:09:43,332
Harold locked it up.

547
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:50,983
Good Lord! Whats happening, girl?

548
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:53,870
Lilly! I think she's
hurt or something.

549
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:55,873
No, it's Okay, it's okay.

550
01:09:55,874 --> 01:09:58,836
You sit right down here dear.
That's it, that's fine.

551
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:03,879
Are you pregnant young lady?

552
01:10:03,879 --> 01:10:06,882
I always wanted to have kids.

553
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:09,885
You got a million reasons
against the kids, I'm to young.

554
01:10:09,885 --> 01:10:13,053
I wasn't to young then,
now I'm to old.

555
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:16,878
Shut up!
Just shut up.

556
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:19,481
All I wanna do,
is find my partner.

557
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:21,130
You just get me in the tunnel!

558
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:24,859
You can't go down there by
yourself, The Butcher.

559
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:27,862
Your comin' with me.

560
01:10:28,904 --> 01:10:33,840
All righty. I'll go clear it out.

561
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:40,865
Your partner, he's the father isn't he?

562
01:10:40,865 --> 01:10:44,920
And, your not wrong to be scared.

563
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:49,925
The thought of bringing a new life
into this world's, a scary notion.

564
01:10:49,925 --> 01:10:53,929
What's takin' your husband
so God damn long?

565
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:55,890
Almost got it cleared out.

566
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:01,900
He's not my husband. I just
met him up on the street...

567
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,897
... couple of weeks ago.

568
01:11:02,897 --> 01:11:04,899
Told me he owns this building.

569
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:06,859
Did he tell you that?

570
01:11:07,902 --> 01:11:09,904
What else did he tell ya?

571
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:12,907
I don't have time for this crap!

572
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:15,290
I'll bet he didn't tell ya...

573
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:17,009
... the Butcher's an alien.

574
01:11:18,424 --> 01:11:20,278
- A what?
- Oh yeah.

575
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:22,440
He's been down here since
before the dinosaurs...

576
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,919
... if you can believe it.
- Alien?

577
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,880
Ready, if you are.

578
01:11:56,951 --> 01:11:58,911
What in the hell is this place?

579
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:02,832
You believe in heaven?

580
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,836
What about hell?

581
01:12:08,879 --> 01:12:10,840
I don't believe in anything.

582
01:12:13,884 --> 01:12:18,679
This whole place, harks back to a
time when things were simpler.

583
01:12:19,274 --> 01:12:22,269
A time when you could put your
faith, in something real.

584
01:12:22,269 --> 01:12:23,641
Would ya look at these stones.

585
01:12:24,402 --> 01:12:27,898
People used to pass through this
tunnel, just like we're doin' now.

586
01:12:27,898 --> 01:12:30,901
They didn't believe in no God neither.

587
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:33,863
Only they weren't huntin',
some butcher.

588
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:38,868
They were the butchers.

589
01:12:47,469 --> 01:12:49,236
I came down here once...

590
01:12:51,043 --> 01:12:52,760
...forgot to light these.

591
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,887
Without em, we'd have a heck
of a time, find our way back.

592
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,744
Do you know where we're going?

593
01:13:08,744 --> 01:13:13,749
Yeah I, I thought that, we were
looking for your partners trail.

594
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,866
Wait a minute, it looks like there's
two sets of tracks here.

595
01:13:18,867 --> 01:13:22,870
You don't think your partners,
first one down here, do ya?

596
01:13:22,871 --> 01:13:24,873
They don't call him the
Butcher for nothin'.

597
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:27,875
Your wife said that she thinks that...

598
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,227
... that the Butcher's an alien.

599
01:13:29,227 --> 01:13:32,880
Well that's, that's ridiculous.

600
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,884
Truth is, 
the Butcher's workin' for aliens...

601
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:38,886
... but, he isn't one himself.

602
01:13:38,886 --> 01:13:43,891
My guess is, he's bettin' God's a goner.

603
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:47,853
Putin all his chips, on another horse.

604
01:13:49,897 --> 01:13:53,903
Just like in, all these pictures here.

605
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:19,844
We're here.

606
01:14:26,352 --> 01:14:27,852
Down there.

607
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:03,387
Know one thing I,
have always maintained...

608
01:15:03,387 --> 01:15:06,599
... if a man's shoe is dirty,...

609
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:09,810
... you've got to wonder
about his soul.

610
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:12,855
Son of a bitch!

611
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:15,858
I saw you pull Paul out of the car!

612
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:17,818
I was just tryin' to--

613
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:21,822
Daisy?

614
01:15:21,864 --> 01:15:23,824
Is that you?

615
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,633
What happened to the lights?

616
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:31,874
How well do you know this blind woman?

617
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:34,377
Rose?
Well she's my wife.

618
01:15:34,377 --> 01:15:36,879
She's not your God damn wife!

619
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:39,027
And if you're not the
Butcher then she is...

620
01:15:39,027 --> 01:15:41,321
... because somebody sure
the fuck is lying to me!

621
01:15:41,321 --> 01:15:44,887
Some nerve you got callin'
my Daisy a butcher!

622
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,889
I heard you two talkin', your pregnant.

623
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:50,893
Least ways you were
before that accident.

624
01:15:50,893 --> 01:15:54,897
Imagine that, pretty young
lady like yourself...

625
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:57,358
... killing your own flesh and blood.

626
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,860
You're the real butcher.

627
01:16:04,637 --> 01:16:05,865
Oh my God!

628
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:07,868
My God!

629
01:16:07,868 --> 01:16:09,829
Sweetie, there is no God!

630
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:32,852
Why are you doing this to me!

631
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,859
No, no!

632
01:16:42,903 --> 01:16:44,864
No!

633
01:16:45,906 --> 01:16:47,908
No!

634
01:16:47,908 --> 01:16:50,870
No, no, no!

635
01:17:10,848 --> 01:17:12,850
I'll do anything!

636
01:17:13,653 --> 01:17:14,852
Please!

637
01:17:14,852 --> 01:17:16,854
Please!

638
01:17:16,854 --> 01:17:18,856
I'll have the baby!

639
01:17:18,856 --> 01:17:20,816
Please!

640
01:18:09,824 --> 01:18:12,326
Sarah!

641
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:14,829
Paul?

642
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,835
Oh, my God!

643
01:18:21,836 --> 01:18:23,838
My God!

644
01:18:31,846 --> 01:18:33,848
No!

645
01:18:33,848 --> 01:18:35,850
No!

646
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:38,853
No!

647
01:18:39,854 --> 01:18:41,856
No!

648
01:19:31,864 --> 01:19:35,399
Sarah!

649
01:19:36,869 --> 01:19:38,829
Sarah!

650
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:42,828
Can you hear me?

651
01:19:44,877 --> 01:19:46,879
It's me...

652
01:19:46,879 --> 01:19:48,881
... Paul...

653
01:19:48,881 --> 01:19:52,843
... I'm here, alive.

654
01:19:53,886 --> 01:19:56,847
They took my mind!

655
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:00,893
It can't be! No, Paul!

656
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:03,854
They need us to breed!

657
01:20:04,897 --> 01:20:07,858
Sarah, the walls!

658
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,861
Watch the walls!

659
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:41,892
Two birds quite stoned.

660
01:20:44,937 --> 01:20:47,940
Just think of this, as a womb.

661
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,942
It's the belly of a beast.

662
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:52,945
A chance to be reborn
into a better world.

663
01:20:52,945 --> 01:20:54,947
And it's free.

664
01:20:54,947 --> 01:20:57,950
Soon the pain and frustration
of being human...

665
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,953
... will be no more than
a bad old dream.

666
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:03,831
It's time, for you think
about things differently.

667
01:21:04,874 --> 01:21:08,836
It's time for you to see things,
the way they really are.

668
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:13,883
It's the craziest thing...

669
01:21:13,883 --> 01:21:17,845
... they got this real sweet
tooth, for bone marrow.

670
01:21:48,918 --> 01:21:50,920
Oh my goodness!

671
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,881
We thought we lost you!

672
01:21:54,924 --> 01:21:56,926
What happened?
Where I am?

673
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:59,150
It was a bad accident, Sarah.

674
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:01,577
You've been unconscious
for several days now.

675
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:04,892
I had the most, horrible nightmare!

676
01:22:04,892 --> 01:22:08,122
Well that's quite normal with
near death experiences...

677
01:22:08,122 --> 01:22:09,897
... such as yours.

678
01:22:09,897 --> 01:22:12,900
Your mind tries to rationalize
your traumas...

679
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:16,904
... to help you make sense
in an irrational world.

680
01:22:16,904 --> 01:22:21,909
Sarah, is there something you'd like
to tell me about the accident?

681
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:23,869
Something you wanna
get off your chest?

682
01:22:24,912 --> 01:22:28,916
I didn't tell you only because
I knew what you would say.

683
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:32,407
It's my body, it's my choice,
it's that simple.

684
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:37,925
Of course it is dear, but there was
another life inside your body.

685
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:41,429
A tiny little life with only
you to protect it...

686
01:22:41,429 --> 01:22:44,932
... that's a mothers responsibility.

687
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:46,892
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

688
01:22:50,288 --> 01:22:55,236
If God can forgive you,
and if I can forgive you...

689
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:58,904
... it's up to you to
forgive yourself.

690
01:22:59,947 --> 01:23:02,825
I know that Paul would
forgive you too.

691
01:23:03,868 --> 01:23:06,871
Oh my God, Paul!
What happened to Paul?

692
01:23:06,871 --> 01:23:09,874
Paul, is brain dead.

693
01:23:09,874 --> 01:23:11,876
What?

694
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:16,839
He's in the next bed over, I thought you'd
want it that way with him close by.

695
01:23:24,406 --> 01:23:25,696
Oh no!

696
01:23:25,697 --> 01:23:27,657
Right here, Sarah.

697
01:23:30,895 --> 01:23:32,897
No.

698
01:23:32,897 --> 01:23:34,857
No!

699
01:23:35,565 --> 01:23:37,902
Don't scream dear, please.

700
01:23:37,902 --> 01:23:39,904
You'll upset the baby.

701
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,490
What baby?
You said my baby's dead!

702
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:44,777
Oh heaven's, no!

703
01:23:44,909 --> 01:23:47,912
You simply weren't fit to be a mother.

704
01:23:47,912 --> 01:23:49,872
Were you, Sarah?

705
01:23:53,918 --> 01:23:56,921
Seems inhumane, but we needed it...

706
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:58,881
... for our self preservation!

707
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,066
No, you can't do this to me!

708
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:10,851
Go easy, sweetie!

709
01:24:12,853 --> 01:24:14,855
Your almost there.

710
01:24:14,855 --> 01:24:18,818
This ain't gonna take long, I promise ya,
it won't be too long.

711
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,823
- Hold still.
- Immortality, on my way to immortality.

712
01:24:44,885 --> 01:24:47,888
Lilly, what the hell did I do
with the keys, to the Nova?

713
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,856
Mr. Lovecraft.

714
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,902
Everything is going to be fine.

715
01:25:42,902 --> 01:25:46,743
All you have to do, is open this door.

716
01:25:46,906 --> 01:25:48,554
- Impossible.
- What?

717
01:25:48,554 --> 01:25:51,661
I, dropped the keys down there.

718
01:25:51,661 --> 01:25:54,269
You impetuous little fool!

719
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,875
Do you know what you've done?

720
01:25:59,919 --> 01:26:02,532
- Put it back!
- What?

721
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,799
Put the book back!

722
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,820
It's coming!

723
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:17,872
The secrets of the Necronomicon
do not come cheep!

724
01:27:17,872 --> 01:27:19,832
This is going to cost you your life!

725
01:27:40,895 --> 01:27:44,857
Consider your privileges
revoked, Mr. Lovecraft.

726
01:28:33,864 --> 01:28:36,826
Lovecraft, you don't know
what you've done!

727
01:28:41,872 --> 01:28:43,833
You'll pay!

728
01:28:46,524 --> 01:28:49,839
Ah him, he's a strange one alright.

729
01:28:51,469 --> 01:28:52,842
Here you are, Sir.

730
01:28:54,885 --> 01:28:56,887
We can go now.

731
01:28:56,887 --> 01:28:58,889
Right.

732
01:28:58,889 --> 01:29:00,891
Take care of your self, mate.

733
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:02,810
Have a good night.

734
01:29:11,234 --> 01:29:14,822
So a, you found what your
looking for, Mr. Lovecraft?

735
01:29:15,823 --> 01:29:19,785
You might say,  it found me.
