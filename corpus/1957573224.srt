No, Caleb.
You're different.

You're an artist
but your contribution

149

to facilitate this whole
degenerative process.

I want your hands on me.

178
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,339
Just put your hands on me.

179
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,519
Oh God.
I just need to breathe.

180
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,612
OK wait. Wait honey, honey,
honey.

181
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,832
Slow. Just go slower, OK?

182
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,753
OK let me feel
your hands and I'll....

183
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,933
Kiss me.

184
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,325
[grunts]

185
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,116
OK.

186
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,640
Oh, God damn it.

187
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,991
Ugh.

188
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,125
You're going too fast OK?
I can't come like that.

189
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:34,650
Not after the day that I had.
And you know the day I had,
Jesus.

190
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,391
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,742
I just need some tenderness,
some slow thick hands.

192
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,483
I know. I know.

193
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:43,877
OK.

194
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,227
Slowly.

195
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,576
Here.

196
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,057
You know, like you enjoy it.

197
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,320
What the fuck does that mean?

198
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,323
Oh, Christ,
don't make that mean anything.

199
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:58,239
What--what does that mean?
You don't think I enjoy it?

200
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,372
No. I just, I think
that you're only thinking

201
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:02,765
about you getting off.

202
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:03,810
You know,
I mean you're wrestling around

203
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,116
on top of me
like I'm not even here.

204
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,773
Well, what do you want me to do?

205
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:13,297
Ugh. I had a hard day, Caleb.

206
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,256
I need to come hard.

207
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:16,736
I need the release.

208
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,956
Let me go down on you.

209
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,698
No. Oh no! Not like that.

210
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,352
That is not spontaneous.

211
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,310
It's not loving.
You have to want to.

212
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,968
I...I want to.

213
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,931
OK.

214
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,149
Slow.

215
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,244
Ow, ow, ow. Shit.

216
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,768
God, did you shave?

217
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:51,945
It's like you're rubbing
me with sandpaper.

218
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,424
Bullshit, Erica.

219
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,079
Why? What?
Why are you so angry?

220
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,778
This is bullshit, Erica.
I can't have sex like this.

221
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,606
This isn't even sex.
This is like Nazi aerobics.

222
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,130
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

223
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,131
You're making this mean
something.

224
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,002
This does mean something.

225
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,613
I'm telling you my needs.

226
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,398
What I need. Is that so awful?

227
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,269
No, your needs are fine.

228
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,925
But this is
two-party masturbation.

229
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,972
Sex is supposed to happen
between two people.

230
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,887
Like a team, you know,
I do a little something,

231
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,628
you do a little something,
like a dance.

232
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,893
I had the fucked day

233
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,939
and all I wanted was just
a little tenderness
and some slow hands.

234
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,508
All you can do is lock me out of
your house and then yell at me.

235
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:37,555
This is--this is so fucked.
So now you're leaving?

236
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:40,558
We're having a confrontation
about our needs,
and you're leaving.

237
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,734
We're not having
a confrontation.
We're having an argument.

238
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,607
This is an argument, Erica,
and I'm sick of this bullshit!

239
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,000
I got an early morning
with Jason.

240
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,002
We got to go over the RTV
we're going to use.

241
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,612
I got to get final approval
on the piece.

242
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,614
I got all these things
I got to do

243
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,268
and all you can think
about is your day.

244
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,531
What happened in your day?

245
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:03,712
Well, Caleb, if you have
some unresolved issues
about your day,

246
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,236
we can discuss them.
You don't have
to get all dramatic.

247
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,283
Everything is unresolved!
Look at me for Christ's sake.

248
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,764
I got a mortgage due
on this place every month
I can barely afford.

249
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,029
I got a guest house I have
to rent that is so fucking small

250
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,900
people are afraid
to even look inside of it.

251
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:22,296
You come over
like some guilt-slinging tornado
screaming "me, me, me!"

252
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,951
You know my grandmother who used
to give me baths in this sink,

253
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:29,477
she died today and I make
fake fucking twats for a living!

254
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,698
What?

255
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,918
No, that is not funny.

256
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,225
-[Erica laughs]
-That is tragically unfunny.

257
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,666
I'm serious. I'm in hell,
and you only made it worse.

258
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,235
I'm sorry, sweetie.

259
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,585
Come here.

260
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,153
No. You're selfish.

261
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:56,156
I am. We all are. I'm sorry.

262
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,287
Now come here.

263
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,905
You really suck.

264
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,777
I do. I'm horrible,
unapproachable.
Now get into bed.

265
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,523
Put your head down on me.

266
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:16,611
Right.

267
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,489
I'm wicked and hateful
and indulgent.

268
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,145
Now go to sleep.

269
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,326
Fuck.

270
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:44,421
Some kind
of music was playing, faintly.

271
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:49,165
Some gothic folk something

272
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:53,474
just sort of warming
the background.

273
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,215
Candles were everywhere

274
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:59,306
like some kind
of artificial daylight

275
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:04,615
and we were completely entwined,

276
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,357
meshed like...

277
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,707
mmm, like one skin.

278
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:13,755
And she tilted her head back

279
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:18,673
and she had this amazing throat,

280
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,200
long like a Modigliani

281
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:29,684
and these sounds
start to escape from her

282
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,774
and it takes me a moment.

283
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:37,083
It took me a moment,
but I realized
she was saying something.

284
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,219
So I moved into her

285
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,614
and she was calling the angels.

286
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:51,053
She was summoning the thousands
of tiny unborn souls

287
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,447
that were circling us
at that moment,

288
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,231
whispering to be incarnated.

289
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:59,888
And I realized
this woman understands.

290
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:05,154
This woman knows that the child
has to be set free.

291
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:08,070
She holds the key
to our heart's existence.

292
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,812
And we're moving
like one animal now.

293
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,641
Strong and vascular

294
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,904
like deep chords of music.

295
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,517
And I just...lost it.

296
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,782
You came inside her?

297
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:28,351
Tell me you didn't come
inside her.

298
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,614
Not really.

299
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,007
Not really.

300
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,183
You pulled out?

301
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:37,447
At the last minute
I had a flash of clarity

302
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:40,407
and I thought,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

303
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:44,498
So I edged out a bit.

304
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:48,284
You edged out?
What does that mean?

305
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:52,506
I got out as soon as I realized
what I was doing.

306
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:56,031
You edged out? Did you pull out?
Did you pull it out in time?

307
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,946
I think I did, yes.

308
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,209
Why don't you
just wear a condom?

309
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,211
We've had this conversation.

310
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,220
What if you got
this woman pregnant?

311
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,787
I'd raise the child.

312
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,225
It would be mine. I don't have
a problem with that.

313
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,881
-How long have you known her?
-What difference does that make?

314
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,665
-How long?
-Tuesday.

315
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:25,234
-Last Tuesday?
-This Tuesday.

316
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,801
Two days?

317
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,891
That's two days,
and you're not wearing a condom.

318
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,981
What difference does it make?
There was a connection.

319
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,854
That only takes a second.
Besides, I want to be a father.

320
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,074
You are insane.

321
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,120
How are you going to be a father
when you're dead?

322
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,818
No one is dying.

323
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,733
They have a cocktail now.

324
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,997
I find out I have AIDS.
I get a few shots.

325
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,743
It's not even remotely
that simple.

326
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,050
How long have you known Erica?

327
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,530
Almost two years.

328
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,010
Do you ever talk about children?

329
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,316
I know you want
to have children.

330
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,841
It takes a long time
to get to know someone.

331
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,321
You had another fight
didn't you?

332
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,237
No.
Yes. No. I don't know.

333
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,239
I don't even know
if it's fighting anymore.

334
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,719
It's just become
the way we relate.

335
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,243
Well, that can't be good.

336
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,114
No.

337
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,507
I finished the mold.

338
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,599
So you think you two
will stay together?

339
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,601
Did you spray
that with clear coat?

340
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,169
-Shit, I forgot.
-Get me some thinner, 2%.

341
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,083
Yeah.

342
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,434
Oh, man! I'm really sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

343
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,523
That's all right.
I'm just a little rushed.

344
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:40,179
Verk wants to see a cast
of this thing by lunch tomorrow.

345
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,659
-That soon?
-Well, yeah it's a business.

346
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,054
This is an $8,000 rubber cooch
for Christ's sake.

347
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,103
-You look tired, Caleb.
-I am.

348
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,237
Spray the fucker.

00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,931
[machine clicks]

352
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,412
CALEB: Hi, this is Caleb.
You've reached
Morpheus Special Effects.

353
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,545
I'm not here right now,
so leave a message.

354
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,111
[beep]

355
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,852
WOMAN [on machine]:
Hello, Caleb. This is Camille.

356
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,855
Yeah.

357
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,814
I read about your guest house
in the paper.

358
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,903
I'm very intrigued.

359
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,862
Caleb, that's a beautiful name.

360
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,038
It's from the Bible, isn't it?

361
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,953
Caleb.

362
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,173
I'd love to know more about you,
Caleb, when you get a chance.

363
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,218
-[beep]
-I'm a sculptor.

364
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,047
Well, an effects technician,
really.

365
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,485
Hello? Hello?

366
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,317
You want to see the guest house?

367
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:02,625
Wait. You want to rent it?

368
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,801
Look, I should tell you.
It's--it's very--

369
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:07,935
No, trust me, please,
it's very small.

370
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,375
It's in the valley.

371
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:17,814
Yeah. I, uh, I could give you
the address.

372
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:20,121
Mm-hmm. Could I just ask you

373
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,992
what it is you do?

374
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:25,822
No, for a living.

375
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,216
You--you're a sculptor?

376
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,957
Sorry?

377
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,612
A sculptress.

378
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,788
[click]

379
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:50,586
MAN: And she said she'd take it
just like that?

380
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:51,761
That's what she said.

381
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,415
Did you tell her
how small it is?

382
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,330
Never got the chance.

383
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:57,288
What is she going to do,
live there by herself?

384
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,942
She's a sculptor.

385
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,641
She sells her pieces out
of her dad's gallery near Davis.

386
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,470
She just needs
room for herself and the clay.

387
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,385
[sighs]
Man, you are so lucky.

388
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,604
What do you mean?

389
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:09,866
Don't you realize who this is?

390
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,825
-Jason.
-Caleb.

391
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:15,524
This is your angel, man.
This is the one.

392
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,353
No questions.
Total commitment to the space.

393
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,400
A sculptor.
What more do you want?

394
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,141
-What's her name?
-I don't even want to tell you.

395
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,882
Why not?

396
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:27,318
Promise me
you won't make it mean anything.

397
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,410
Camille.

398
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,063
Oh, my God!

399
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:36,676
Fuck. I got to go.
What time is it?

400
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,069
It's 20 to 12:00.

401
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,028
I got to go. I got to meet
Richard Verk in half an hour.

402
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,899
How did the thing turn out?

403
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,206
Well, we'll see.

404
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,687
Caleb...

405
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:50,167
this is a magnificent time
to be alive.

406
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,320
Caleb, Janice.
We spoke on the phone.
Please, sit down.

407
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:19,327
This is Richard Verk.

408
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,896
Do you need an iced tea?

409
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,637
Do I need one?

410
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,203
Another iced tea, por favor.

411
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,727
That's so rude.

412
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:30,251
What's rude?
I assume he speak Spanish.

413
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,906
-You should never assume.
-Children, children.

414
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,125
Let's not squabble
over such non-issues.

415
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,606
There, you see
the beverages arrived?

416
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,260
Now, everybody may
refresh themselves.

417
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:47,486
[police siren passes by]

418
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:54,362
Well, let's get down
to business.

419
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,277
Have you brought it with you?

420
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:59,367
-I'm sorry, what?
-The thing, the prize,

421
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,370
the great compromise
that's kept me up all hours,

422
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,025
nearly ruining
my artistic vision.

423
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:07,593
Do you have it?

424
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:11,422
Oh, the thing.
Yes, yes, I have it.
I have it right here.

425
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,425
Well, may I see it?

426
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,688
Here?

427
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,908
I have to avenge with it.

428
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:24,566
Now? Right--right now?

429
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,002
Is there a problem, Caleb?

430
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,830
Did they bring this sweetener
for your tea?

431
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,440
Oh, I don't--
I don't need anything.

432
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,747
No, there's no problem.
I just thought Mr. Verk would--

433
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,880
Please. Call him Richard.

434
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,403
Call me Richard.

435
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,231
Richard,

436
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,711
would like to see it in a more--

437
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,931
or rather less--public arena.

438
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,413
Arena?

439
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,721
You used the word arena.
That's very interesting.

440
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,898
An arena, as in a circus.

441
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,074
That's apropos really.

442
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,338
This is like a circus.

443
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,689
A laughless circus.

444
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,562
If this is indeed an arena,

445
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,608
this place a stage
for spectacle and daring.

446
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,916
Show us your act, Caleb.

447
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:11,178
Join us.

448
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:15,225
Will you join our circus, Caleb?

449
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,935
Oh, my God.

450
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,808
Yes.

451
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,505
Let me look at it.

452
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:40,033
Oh, that is disgusting.

453
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,470
Oh no it's not.
Quite the contrary.

454
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,690
It's a compliment really.

455
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,388
He rendered it so lifelike.

456
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:51,218
I just assumed it must emit
some odor, however faint.

457
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,569
Do you want have a look
at it, Henry?

458
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,007
No thank you, Richard.
I don't have much experience
with those.

459
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,923
Hmm. Really it's lovely.

460
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:04,274
-It's so light.
-It's high-density silicone.

461
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:06,537
It's a little warm
to wear but strong.

462
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,974
That's something, isn't it?

463
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,498
I guess.

464
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,066
Good Lord.
It really is lovely.

465
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,937
It's remarkable.

466
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:18,027
Maybe I should do
a "comedia del'arte" piece.

467
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,770
I could have all the actors
wear this sex on their faces.

468
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,729
HENRY:
It's time to be getting back--

469
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,426
I've got a meeting with Anna.

470
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,819
RICHARD:
You know I really am impressed.

471
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,429
A little too impressed,
actually.

472
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,824
It's lovely,
but it's another movie entirely.

473
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,652
Seeing it now,

474
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:37,003
I realized that I really need
something a bit more O'Keefe.

475
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,179
Georgia O'Keefe?

476
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,528
Exactly.

477
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,095
You're so bright.

478
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:45,968
You've seen them, those lovely,
strong water colors.

479
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,927
Orchids and lilies,

480
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,625
like great breathing vaginas.

481
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,497
Uh, yeah.

482
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,456
Yeah, that's more what we need.

483
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,154
This is a bit too...

484
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,982
on the nose.

485
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,984
Are you with me?

486
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:05,596
Uh...well, actually, heh.

487
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,252
I was under the impression that
this piece was going to work

488
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,820
in about 1/8 of a second
of film,

489
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,735
just when she uncrosses
her legs.

490
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,694
How did you know that?

491
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,566
It was in the job order.
I read the script.

492
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,742
-Where did you get a script?
-You read the script?

493
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,353
I want the option, Caleb,

494
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,965
to discover, if necessary.

495
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,750
OK. I'm sorry.

496
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:31,492
-No, no, it's all right.
-It can be fixed.

497
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:35,365
It's going to have to be fitted.

498
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,759
Yes, yes.
Have you met Anna McCaphrey?

499
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,893
-No.
-You have Friday free?

500
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,416
Friday it is.

501
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,593
I'm sorry I don't think
I can make Friday.

502
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,856
Is there some sort of problem?

503
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:52,295
I have a...
well, I have a thing on Friday.

504
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:54,254
What sort of thing?

505
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:57,344
Can't we do it any other day?

506
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,128
No.

507
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,695
This is important, Caleb.

508
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,611
This is the show.

509
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,528
What do you have?
If you don't mind my query.

510
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,530
Oh, well...

511
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,708
my--my grandmother just died.

512
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,492
She died a few days ago,

513
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:18,234
and well,
the funeral is this Friday.

514
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:19,453
You were very close?

515
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,889
-Not really.
-Then it's settled.

516
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,635
I'll talk to Anna's assistant.
She'll get in touch with you.

517
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,028
But I told my mother--

518
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,988
Caleb, it's really very simple.

519
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,775
This business is
about sacrifice.

520
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,038
Let me tell you a little story.

521
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,040
My mother
missed my high school graduation

522
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,998
because she had to be backstage
for opening night

523
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,391
for one of her clients.

524
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,481
Now, at the time,
I was heartbroken.

525
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,614
But that actress went on
to win the Tony Award

526
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,268
for the best performance.

527
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,445
I always felt a little
responsible for that.

528
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:58,492
When I got married
she had a similar conflict.

529
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:02,322
But that actor won
the People's Choice Award
and a Golden Globe.

530
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,629
Two weeks later, I got a gift
basket with some bath salts,

531
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,937
and a typed note that says,
"Sure you'll be happy.

532
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:11,026
Hope it lasts. Mom."

533
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,683
But four years ago
when she died,

534
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,208
I was on the set
of Richard Verk's
breakthrough film,

535
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:23,038
The Right to Remain Silent.
I couldn't make the funeral

536
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,693
but that film did
over a $130 domestic

537
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,956
and three times that foreign.

538
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:32,831
Sacrifice is what has made
all of these tremendous things
possible.

539
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,007
Now trust me.
I know it's harsh.

540
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,705
But this is your moment
to shine.

541
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,838
It may not come again,

542
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,623
either you want it or you don't.

543
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,756
Do you have my number?

544
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,759
Of course.

545
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,066
Caleb.

546
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,373
This could lead to other things.

547
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:54,635
Sure.

548
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,253
Hi.

549
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,864
I didn't hear you.

550
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,648
Well, that's because you were
listening to the clay.

551
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,869
I thought you might be hungry.

552
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,827
Christ, that's quite a feast.

553
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,655
Yes, well,
and I delivered it myself.

554
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,265
I assume if you're following
the usual pattern

555
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,137
you haven't eaten yet.

556
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,661
You assumed correct, my lady.

557
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,056
Well, so stop your trifling
over there.

558
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:27,537
Come join me
in this most exquisite repast.

559
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,278
Where do you want to eat?

560
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,454
Well, over here on the table
of course.

561
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:34,980
Where you create,
we shall nourish ourselves.

562
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,334
What's this for?

563
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:42,901
Same thing.

564
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:46,600
Oh, are they doing 
Little Shop of Horrorsnow?

565
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,908
I had a meeting with Verk.
He said he wanted some changes.

566
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,171
-I guess he wanted the option.
-Option to what?

567
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,824
Break into songs
about fertilizer?

568
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,914
Actually, it had something to do
with artistic vision,

569
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,654
whatever that means.

570
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,830
Hey, didn't you have
a callback today?

571
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,267
Now why would you want
to go ruin

572
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,269
this lovely old evening
with talk like that?

573
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,532
Was it that bad?

574
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:07,186
Picture this.

575
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:11,016
I walk into a room
with every faux-chested,

576
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,366
collagen-lipped actress
in Hollywood.

577
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,064
Some of them even have these
little futuristic outfits on,

578
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:19,763
so I'm feeling really lame
in this dress.

579
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,504
I sit down,
start going over the sides.

580
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,246
The casting assistant,
she squeaks out
of her little office

581
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:27,075
and she hands me
another set of slides.

582
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,598
Well, now I'm feeling
pretty good, right?

583
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,732
No outfit,
but I put an extra set of slides

584
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,734
which is more than these
silicone losers have.

585
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:37,781
Then I looked down and I see it.

586
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:40,784
"Engine technician one."

587
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,961
OK, scroll to cross the page.

588
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:46,138
Well, time folded right then
and there and I saw myself,

589
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:49,663
40 years old with bad caps doing
dinner theater in Michigan.

590
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:53,232
I thought this is it, I'm out.

591
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:56,539
This is not what
six years living in New York

592
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,020
fighting winters
and roaches and assholes

593
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,979
with too much hair gel
was all about.

594
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,894
You have two years
with the best acting teacher
in the country, Caleb.

595
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,506
Working for tips
on Christmas eve,

596
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:09,248
auditioning for any part
that like might have a line,

597
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,380
wear that fucking
chicken costume in front
of Madison Square Garden.

598
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,904
Oh, my God.
Why am I going there?

599
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,734
Anyway, I had an epiphany.

600
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,475
I'm quitting.

601
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah I'm going to be doing
photography full-time.

602
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,480
I already lined up a couple
of suckers for headshots.

603
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,309
So, that's it.

604
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,528
I'm happy.

605
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,316
Wow. That's a lot of change
for one day.

606
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,752
Yeah, well, not really.

607
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,364
I mean,
it's been coming in a long time.

608
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,888
I'm just--I'm sick of doing
what doesn't make me happy

609
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,629
in the hope that someday
it might.

610
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:45,588
That's amazing.
And I'm really proud of you.

611
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,982
-To the unknown.
-To the unknown.

612
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,684
I missed you.

613
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,686
I really missed you.

614
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:02,953
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for all my shit.

615
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,086
You know, it's like
I get so scared.

616
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,175
I get so scared.
I get so wrapped up.
And I could get--

617
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,569
I know, it's OK.

618
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,355
I want you to know
how much I treasure you, Caleb.

619
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,922
I'd get you.

620
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,318
God, I'm so glad you were born.

621
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,543
[metal clanging]

622
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,939
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

623
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,941
Well, I'm trying to--
this table is very uneven.

624
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,985
OK.
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

625
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,074
Let me rotate down a little.

626
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,379
-Ouch
-Aw.

627
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,641
-Shit.
-What?

628
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:39,860
My knees are, like, digging
into this table.

629
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,774
OK. All right, hey, turn over.

630
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,384
No, this is fine.

631
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,952
Oh, it's not fine.
Look at your face.

632
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,996
You look like you're
doing your income tax.

633
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,347
-Well, I'm in pain.
-OK, then stop.

634
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,784
But you wanted to.
Don't make this about me, OK.

635
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,221
You were right there with me.

636
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:55,049
Oh, let's forget it.

637
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,920
Oh, my God.
Did you lose your erection?

638
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,748
Jesus!

639
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,794
Well, did you? It's not
like anybody's here to hear us.

640
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:03,405
Well, obviously for not fucking,
I've lost my erection.

641
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:06,582
-All right, God, calm down.
-Let's just forget it.

642
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:09,324
It's all right.

643
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,370
God, it's all right.

644
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,719
I can masturbate.

645
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,634
No.

646
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,505
Why not? I'm horny.

647
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,594
What are you like some kind
of spy missile?

648
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,858
You get a program in
and you have to carry it out
no matter what?

649
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,512
Hey that's just mean, all right?

650
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:24,992
I didn't throw you losing
your erection in your face.

651
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,082
-Yes, you did.
-Well, I just mentioned it.

652
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,302
Can't you just not do
that right now?

653
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,652
Can't we just be together?

654
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,958
I don't see
what the big deal is.

655
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,569
I feel like an ornament
or something.

656
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,092
I mean you go off
and please yourself

657
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,789
while I'm over here staring
at the fucking ceiling.

658
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,314
OK. OK. OK, honey. Come here.
You can do it for me.

659
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,359
I'm sorry, I'm just--

660
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,579
I'm just not in the mood.

661
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,147
So that
means I shouldn't be either?

662
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,323
No. That means that out of
consideration for me,

663
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:55,022
for what I'm feeling,
you'll just not do that.

664
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,504
I'm sorry. I really,
I thought our relationship was

665
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,462
like a whole different kind
of relationship.

666
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:01,985
-Well, what does that mean?
-Well, I just thought

667
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,596
that we could be ourselves
around one another,

668
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:06,207
you know, and not hide
behind any bullshit premises.

669
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,427
Hey, I don't think what
I'm feeling is bullshit, Erica.

670
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,646
I'm asking you not to masturbate
in front of me.

671
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,300
Is that so difficult
to understand?

672
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,041
OK and I am asking you
for the freedom and support

673
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,261
that I thought
this relationship was built on.

674
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,612
Look, if you want to play
with yourself so bad,
then play with yourself!

675
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:22,658
Oh, my God.
Why does this always happen?

676
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,791
Why? It's like we disagree.
And instead of it just being

677
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,358
what it is
it becomes this whole thing,

678
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:29,622
-you know, full of meaning.
-These are my feelings, Erica.

679
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,885
Yes,
they're your feelings, Caleb.
Well, I have feelings too.

680
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,279
God, why are your feelings
more important than mine?

681
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:37,020
That's not what I'm saying,
all right?

682
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:39,458
Making love takes two people.
Two people have to be involved.

683
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:43,070
Who says?
It's just sex, OK?

684
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,115
I mean that's it.
People can make it mean
whatever they want.

685
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,074
They can fuck.
They can make love.

686
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,859
One person can masturbate
the other can watch.
Whatever, you know.

687
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,427
I mean, it all comes
down to what you make it mean.

688
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,603
I don't know.
I don't believe that.

689
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,388
I think it does mean something

690
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,955
when another person is present,
it means something.

691
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,219
Oh? That's very interesting
coming from a guy

692
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,570
who carts a rubber vagina
around town for a living.

693
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,963
-Fuck you.
-Why?

694
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,878
That has nothing to do
with anything.

695
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,750
Why not? I mean the act is
so sacred to you

696
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,754
I thought the parts that
went along with it would be too.

697
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,104
I don't even know what
we're talking about anymore.

698
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,584
OK. You know what then?

699
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:21,239
Come here.

700
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,763
Let's not talk about it.

701
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,071
-Are you mad?
-Uh-uh.

702
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:31,640
I just think
we have some issues.

703
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,991
Well, if it's me, I'm sorry.

704
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:38,299
If it's you?
Is that, I'm sorry,

705
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,519
is that you trying to take
responsibility or something?

706
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,477
God, I'm so sick of this shit.

707
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:45,001
Look, I'm sorry I just have
a lot on my mind.

708
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:48,309
I got an early meeting with
Anna McCaphrey in the morning.

709
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,876
You're meeting Anna McCaphrey?

710
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,227
Well, yeah, I got to fit her
with the prosthesis.

711
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,230
Why do you have to meet her?

712
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,058
Well, I guess
I could reach my measuring tape

713
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,973
around her body
and never introduce myself

714
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:02,671
but it's not the best way
to have a client relationship.

715
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,413
Oh so now she's a client?

716
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,154
Well, yeah she's wearing
the thing.

717
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,548
I am sorry. I thought you're
in a meeting with Verk.

718
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,289
I thought you were working
with Verk.

719
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,291
Hey, don't make
this mean anything, Erica.

720
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,685
Are you going to her house?

721
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:19,035
I don't know, whatever is
convenient for her, I guess.

722
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,342
Do you want to go to her house?

723
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,954
I don't care.
I just want to do the job,
get it over with, get paid.

724
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,434
Aren't you curious?

725
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:28,175
-About what?
-How she must live a rich,

726
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,352
gorgeous, terrible actress
like her.

727
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,573
Whew! She must have
a horror show for a house.

728
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:37,489
I don't think
she's a bad actress.

729
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,839
Oh puhlease, did you see her
in The Right to Remain Silent?

730
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,537
Did you for one second, buy her
as a cop with all the hair?

731
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:46,324
"Hey freeze, assholes.
You have the right
to remain silent."

732
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:47,629
The way she would like leave
her gun here,

733
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,153
I mean she's
like a mud-wrestling fantasy.

734
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,504
She had some moments
in that other thing she did.

735
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,376
Oh yeah right,
the waitress thing.
Come please!

736
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,944
The woman's not waited a table
in her life.

737
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,251
-You don't know that.
-She's limited at best.

738
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,342
You're not the same type
so you shouldn't worry about it.

739
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,303
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

740
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:12,350
You're nothing like each other,
that's all.

741
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,136
Why? Because I won't flash
my twat and flip my hair

742
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,312
a thousand times
for a camera crew?

743
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,098
Look,
what difference does it make?

744
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,840
You quit.

745
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:27,234
That's right.

746
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,280
I quit.

747
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,108
I'm entitled to my opinion.

748
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:39,289
[vehicle approaches]

749
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,034
-[thunder]
-Shit.

750
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:53,652
Hello.

751
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:54,957
Sorry.

752
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:56,829
I waited.

753
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,875
Right. Oh you're--
you're Camille, right?

754
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,660
Yeah.

755
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,358
OK. You want to come inside?

756
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:15,848
You really don't have
to show me the place.

757
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,763
I know what I want it.
I have all my stuff.

758
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,417
Yeah, you brought everything?

759
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,331
Yeah.

760
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,986
You're serious?

761
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,075
You haven't even seen it.

762
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:29,296
I have money.

763
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,778
Well, that's good but I'd like
to know something about you.

764
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,694
I knew everything
about you from your voice.

765
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:38,436
Oh.

766
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:40,568
Where did you live last?

767
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,440
At home.

768
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,616
Did you make these sculptures?

769
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,314
Yeah.
Did you pay rent there?

770
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,059
They're just
how I imagined them.

771
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,716
You work from your dreams too.

772
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,328
Yes, sometimes.

773
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,636
All the time.

774
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,378
Have--have you lived
any place else?

775
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,904
No.
No other place seemed right.

776
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,950
Do you want to help me unpack
my things? I don't have much.

777
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:17,431
I don't know.
I got to think about this.

778
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:20,565
-Why?
-Well, you know, we just--

779
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,393
Does somebody else want
to live there?

780
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,439
Oh no, no.

781
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,920
I can't even get people
to look inside of it.

782
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,138
I have money.

783
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,751
It's, um...

784
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:37,320
first and last and security.

785
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,846
Right.

786
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:46,765
Well...show you the place.

787
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:08,395
It's perfect.

788
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,658
It's just how I imagined it.

789
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,749
Oh, glad you like it.

790
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,751
-One room.
-Sorry?

791
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:19,449
One room.

792
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,409
It's like the center of a body.

793
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,891
It's like a perfect seashell.

794
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:29,372
Great bloodless heart.

795
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,247
[exhales]

796
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,305
Sit down.

797
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:50,568
OK.

798
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:05,017
Do you remember
when you were little?

799
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:08,281
You could look on something
for hours and hours

800
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:12,024
and see all different shapes
inside the one thing.

801
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:14,026
Yeah.

802
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:17,333
You could look
at a candle flame or a rose bud

803
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:19,640
and see world
after world inside it.

804
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:26,516
And the deeper you looked

805
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,390
the less you felt like yourself.

806
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,958
You felt like the flame
or the flower.

807
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,440
It's so simple.

808
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,575
What's it like now?

809
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,537
It's different.

810
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,367
It's harder.

811
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:59,158
Listen, I'm going to go.

812
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:01,421
But if you need anything

813
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:02,988
I'm just in that front house,
OK?

814
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:04,554
OK.

815
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,426
OK.

816
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:07,557
[door creaks closes]

817
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,429
I need something.

818
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,213
You do?

819
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,520
I need you
to keep talking to me.

820
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,871
-Keep telling me things.
-We don't even know each other.

821
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,222
Not yet,
but it's becoming clear.

822
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:42,331
How did you know
that I work from my dreams?

823
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:46,335
Same way anyone would,
by looking at your work.

824
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,903
A lot of people
have seen my work.

825
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:52,211
Heh. Yeah. But how many
have actually looked at it?

826
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,476
I don't know.
Maybe you're the first.

827
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:05,180
When a sculpture of mine
wants to be born,

828
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,227
I get a visit
from the moth fairy.

829
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:13,058
Moth fairy?

830
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:16,322
She only comes to me
late at night

831
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:18,803
and only on certain nights.

832
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:23,155
When my heart is in love with my
mind and my mind becomes full.

833
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:27,072
Then she lights on my pillow

834
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,031
and she tells me in her little
winged voice what it's to be.

835
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,255
The hardest part is remembering.

836
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:42,827
Remembering the feeling
when you first find out
what you're about to make.

837
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:48,484
Once you have that,
the rest just follows.

838
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,922
[thunder]

839
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:55,840
It's all there really is.

840
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,407
I think we were born
with everything

841
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:01,628
and then the world starts
to fill us up, and we forget.

842
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,726
You actually make your living
selling your artwork.

843
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:14,336
You're funny.

844
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,208
Heh.

845
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,732
That makes it more real to you,
doesn't it?

846
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:24,477
If people would part
with their money

847
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,174
to possess
what they already have

848
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:29,612
but have forgotten they have,

849
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:33,312
yeah, people buy it.

850
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:35,662
I'm on a two-year backorder.

851
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,533
Really?

852
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:38,796
Yeah.

853
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,369
You can work magic, Caleb.

854
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:54,637
That hasn't been my experience.

855
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:56,030
First you have to believe it.

856
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:14,005
[thunder]

857
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,168
What are you smiling about?
You're fucking radiant.

858
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:49,518
-Oh, my God.
-What? What happened?

859
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,129
You'll never believe
what I did last night.

860
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:52,782
Do I know her?

861
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,175
Oh, my God!
This is so not like me.

862
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,481
-Bullshit, what happened?
-Camille.

863
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:56,961
And she moves in just like that.

864
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:58,136
Really?

865
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,399
She starts talking to me, right,

866
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:01,661
talking to me like she knows me
and understands me.

867
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,532
She sells her sculptures.

868
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:07,275
She has this moth fairy thing.
She makes magic happen...

869
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:08,886
And you fucked her, right?

870

No, but we kiss,
and it was incredible.

what I was doing or why.
We just meshed together.

Have you told Erica yet?

873

Fuck, no. I have to do that.

Why?

875

a relationship based on trust.

Caleb, you spent last night dry
humping the moth fairly lady,

you might have had is broken.

-I don't know. You want to go?

of boss.

888

Just go. You'll walk in there,

she'll be completely charmed
by you.

Either of that,
or you'll piss her off,

891

in this town again.

Now her roommate's
in the shower,

1036

so we have to wait to get
into the bathroom.

to analyze everything

what beautiful about them.

to love me because of them,

1219

respect you for your perfection,

everyone has them, Caleb. Fuck.

with me,

you don't want to be with me.

as a whole, unique person.
