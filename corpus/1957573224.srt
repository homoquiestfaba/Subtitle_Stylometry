00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,215
[phone ringing]

3
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:19,139
Hello? Oh hi, Mom.

4
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,838
Mom, what's wrong?

5
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:29,192
Mom. Mom, I can't hear you.

6
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,412
Put the phone closer.

7
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,153
What happened?

8
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,546
What do you?

9
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:38,636
When?

10
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:39,898
Why are you?

11
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,643
When's the funeral?

12
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:46,905
[door knobs shakes,
knocking at door]

13
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:50,518
WOMAN: Hello!
Hello! Caleb.

14
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:51,780
Uh-huh.

15
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,695
[knocking continues]

16
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:56,567
Well, I don't know if I'm going
to be able to make the Mass.

17
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:59,440
Well, because I got
to finish this thing.

18
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,312
No,
it's a entirely different thing.

19
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,053
Are you OK?

20
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,622
Did you call Lauren?

21
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,189
[glass breaks]

22
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,802
Mom, listen,
I'm really sorry but--

23
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,108
Mom, I'm very sorry, but I--

24
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,415
I'm going to have
to call you back.

25
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,810
Erica is here.

26
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,682
Why won't you open this door?

27
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,597
Mom, seriously,

28
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,644
I--I'm going
to have to call you back.

29
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,907
I love you too.
Bye-bye.

30
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:40,350
Ah fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

31
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,830
Are you OK, sweetie?

32
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,050
No. No.
No, I'm not fucking OK.

33
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,443
Use your innate sense
of observation.

34
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:49,272
-You're an artist.
-It didn't go well?

35
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,232
No. No. No, it didn't go well
for fuck's sake.

36
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:53,972
What do you think? Look at me.

37
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,191
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,981
You want to talk about it?

39
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,157
Oh.

40
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,770
Get up!

41
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:11,773
Get up!

42
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:17,344
Sit down. OK.

43
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,563
Now, I'm you.

44
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,262
That makes you, me.

45
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:25,874
I've been sitting all night
in the nice candlelight

46
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,703
listening to geriatric favorites
or whatever

47
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,487
working on whatever that is.

48
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:34,012
You have just had the worst,

49
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,753
most humiliating audition
of your life.

50
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:40,062
The sheer soul killing terror of
which is only compounded

51
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,369
by the nightmare
known as the 405 freeway.

52
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,720
You drive all the way out
to the valley

53
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,765
in, like,
sluggish rush hour hell,

54
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,941
could've gone
to your own house, right?

55
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,943
Which is only a few minutes
from the audition, but no.

56
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,118
Listen. I'm sorry.
You want me to get you
something?

57
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,643
But it's Wednesday. Yeah.

58
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:56,600
And that's one of the nights
that you've agreed to spend
at your boyfriend's house.

59
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,254
Your boyfriend
who says he loves you

60
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:59,908
and supports you
regardless of your intensity

61
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,519
which he says just makes
you all the sexier.

62
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,957
And then when you finally get
there, he locks you out.

63
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:09,309
-I was talking to my mother.
-Who hates me!

64
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,312
All right. All right.
That's game. That's game.

65
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:15,619
I'm putting you in the bath.
You need the treatment.

66
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,578
Oh God.

67
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,146
Is that the full
treatment or just a bath?

68
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,235
Disrobe and find out.

69
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:26,500
[sighs]

70
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,199
[groans]

71
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,295
How was your day, sweetie?

72
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,734
Uh, I was perfect for that part.

73
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:46,084
I am Rocket Girl.

74
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,521
Don't laugh.

75
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,089
Perfect for that thing.
You saw what I wore?

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,743
None of the other people
at that audition

77
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,310
went in there putting
any effort into it whatsoever.

78
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,443
I walk in looking
like a complete asshole.

79
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,403
You're enthusiastic.
That's a gift.

80
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,710
I can't do this anymore.

81
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,060
Oh, little hot house flower.

82
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,717
How was your day?

83
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,980
My grandma died.

84
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:16,854
I guess she couldn't find
her nitro pills.

85
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:20,554
You know how cluttered
her house is with all those
tea cups and spoons.

86
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:24,166
She couldn't remember
how to dial 911. So...

87
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,735
You OK?

88
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:31,739
Yeah. It's weird.
I wasn't that close to her.

89
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,218
Just when I was little

90
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,266
she used
to give me baths in this sink.

91
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:39,964
Do you have to go
to the funeral?

92
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,924
Well, I want to go.

93
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:46,493
Oh no, I know.
Just when is that happening?

94
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:50,279
I don't know.
I got to call my mom back.

95
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,368
I'm really sorry, Caleb.

96
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,416
Let me get you a towel.

97
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,507
Have you finished the thing yet?

98
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:01,899
[Caleb chuckles]

99
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,379
I got a lot
of work done on it tonight.

100
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,555
And I found some very lucid

101
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:08,471
gynecological resource books
that helped.

102
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,126
I just have some smoothing
and some texturing to do.

103
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,258
Oh, that is gross.

104
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,565
It's just sculpting
like anything else.

105
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,262
No, it isn't. It's tainted.

106
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:20,004
Hiring someone to actually
construct a prosthetic vagina?

107
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:23,355
I mean, that borders
on the pathological
or extreme indulgence.

108
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,009
Well,
what are they supposed to do?

109
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,185
I mean, they hired this woman
with the explicit understanding

110
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,231
she might have to show
some muff.

111
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,842
Oh. Oh, my God.
That is so demeaning.

112
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,627
What do you want me to call it?

113
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,978
Oh, I don't know let's see,
twat, fur biscuit,
soft shell taco?

114
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,719
Her private region.

115
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,503
Really muff,
that is so unlike you.

116
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,418
You sound like a beer soaked
frat boy idiot.

117
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,985
She agreed to do the nudity.

118
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,508
OK, that's not nudity, Caleb.

119
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,206
That is male-repressed
aggressive bullshit preying

120
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,339
on the sexual insecurities
of some actress,

121
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,428
like it's some tremendous
catharsis

122
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,038
to spread your legs
for a camera.

123
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,910
It's a job.

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,998
There are other kinds
of acting jobs, Caleb.

125
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:00,044
No, for me it's a job.

126
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,960
-It's demeaning for both of you.
-You haven't even seen it.

127
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,919
Well, yeah.
I know what one looks like.

128
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,965
No, but I've made this
from nothing.

129
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,446
Honey, I think one would be
equally correct

130
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,840
in stating you copied it
from nature.

131
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,800
What? Why?

132
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,585
Don't get insulted.

133
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,978
Why not get insulted
when you insult me?

134
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,328
I didn't mean anything.

135
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,853
You totally belittled what I do.

136
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,725
You are capable of much more
interesting work than this.

137
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,684
That's not the point.

138
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,947
This is what I'm doing
right now.

139
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,601
This is what's been taking
weeks of work and research,

140
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,603
of a building up
and tearing down,

141
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:40,302
trying to reveal some subtlety.
This is my work right now.

142
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,956
OK, but you're missing
the whole point.

143
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,525
The very nature of this project
is beyond any kind of subtlety.

144
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,657
It is a woman's vagina
for Christ's sake.

145
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,355
That is blatant non-imaginative
exploitation.

146
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,270
But my contribution
is different.

147
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,447
No, Caleb.
You're different.

148
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,580
You're an artist
but your contribution

149
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,714
in this instance is
to facilitate this whole
degenerative process.

150
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:04,631
That is really unfair.
You haven't even seen it.

151
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:05,762
Put it up here.

152
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,164
-Can I touch it?
-No, the clay's still soft.

153
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,339
Haven't made a mold of it yet.

154
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,558
OK.

155
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,040
Interesting.

156
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,651
You hate it.

157
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,826
It's that all the hair
it's going to have?

158
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,784
I don't know.
It's not my department.

159
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:30,091
Because right now,
all bald like that
it looks like a little girl's

160
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,180
which is sick enough
but on a grown woman, oh really.

161
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,182
Man! Hollywood never ceases
to amaze me.

162
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,836
Caleb.

163
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,316
Caleb, I think you're brilliant.

164
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,492
I might not think
that everything you do is.

165
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,972
You know what?

166
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:45,062
That sounds just like something
my mother would say.

167
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,282
-Wow.
-Yeah.

168
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,897
Get into bed.
OK. Come on.

169
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,129
I love you, sweetie.

170
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,826
I love what you do.

171
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,959
It's OK. Forget it.

172
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,354
Come here. Come here.

173
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,836
[sighs]

174
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,232
Oh God,
I had such a shitty day.

175
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:29,846
I look forward to this clinch
all day long. I missed you.

176
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:36,548
I missed how you smell
and how you hold me.

177
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,772
I want your hands on me.

178
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,339
Just put your hands on me.

179
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,519
Oh God.
I just need to breathe.

180
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,612
OK wait. Wait honey, honey,
honey.

181
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,832
Slow. Just go slower, OK?

182
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,753
OK let me feel
your hands and I'll....

183
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,933
Kiss me.

184
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,325
[grunts]

185
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,116
OK.

186
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,640
Oh, God damn it.

187
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,991
Ugh.

188
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,125
You're going too fast OK?
I can't come like that.

189
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:34,650
Not after the day that I had.
And you know the day I had,
Jesus.

190
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,391
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,742
I just need some tenderness,
some slow thick hands.

192
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,483
I know. I know.

193
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:43,877
OK.

194
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,227
Slowly.

195
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,576
Here.

196
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,057
You know, like you enjoy it.

197
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,320
What the fuck does that mean?

198
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,323
Oh, Christ,
don't make that mean anything.

199
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:58,239
What--what does that mean?
You don't think I enjoy it?

200
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,372
No. I just, I think
that you're only thinking

201
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:02,765
about you getting off.

202
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:03,810
You know,
I mean you're wrestling around

203
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,116
on top of me
like I'm not even here.

204
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,773
Well, what do you want me to do?

205
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:13,297
Ugh. I had a hard day, Caleb.

206
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,256
I need to come hard.

207
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:16,736
I need the release.

208
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,956
Let me go down on you.

209
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,698
No. Oh no! Not like that.

210
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,352
That is not spontaneous.

211
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,310
It's not loving.
You have to want to.

212
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,968
I...I want to.

213
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,931
OK.

214
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,149
Slow.

215
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,244
Ow, ow, ow. Shit.

216
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,768
God, did you shave?

217
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:51,945
It's like you're rubbing
me with sandpaper.

218
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,424
Bullshit, Erica.

219
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,079
Why? What?
Why are you so angry?

220
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,778
This is bullshit, Erica.
I can't have sex like this.

221
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,606
This isn't even sex.
This is like Nazi aerobics.

222
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,130
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

223
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,131
You're making this mean
something.

224
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,002
This does mean something.

225
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,613
I'm telling you my needs.

226
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,398
What I need. Is that so awful?

227
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,269
No, your needs are fine.

228
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,925
But this is
two-party masturbation.

229
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,972
Sex is supposed to happen
between two people.

230
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,887
Like a team, you know,
I do a little something,

231
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,628
you do a little something,
like a dance.

232
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,893
I had the fucked day

233
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,939
and all I wanted was just
a little tenderness
and some slow hands.

234
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,508
All you can do is lock me out of
your house and then yell at me.

235
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:37,555
This is--this is so fucked.
So now you're leaving?

236
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:40,558
We're having a confrontation
about our needs,
and you're leaving.

237
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,734
We're not having
a confrontation.
We're having an argument.

238
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,607
This is an argument, Erica,
and I'm sick of this bullshit!

239
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,000
I got an early morning
with Jason.

240
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,002
We got to go over the RTV
we're going to use.

241
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,612
I got to get final approval
on the piece.

242
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,614
I got all these things
I got to do

243
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,268
and all you can think
about is your day.

244
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,531
What happened in your day?

245
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:03,712
Well, Caleb, if you have
some unresolved issues
about your day,

246
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,236
we can discuss them.
You don't have
to get all dramatic.

247
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,283
Everything is unresolved!
Look at me for Christ's sake.

248
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,764
I got a mortgage due
on this place every month
I can barely afford.

249
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,029
I got a guest house I have
to rent that is so fucking small

250
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,900
people are afraid
to even look inside of it.

251
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:22,296
You come over
like some guilt-slinging tornado
screaming "me, me, me!"

252
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,951
You know my grandmother who used
to give me baths in this sink,

253
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:29,477
she died today and I make
fake fucking twats for a living!

254
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,698
What?

255
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,918
No, that is not funny.

256
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,225
-[Erica laughs]
-That is tragically unfunny.

257
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,666
I'm serious. I'm in hell,
and you only made it worse.

258
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,235
I'm sorry, sweetie.

259
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,585
Come here.

260
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,153
No. You're selfish.

261
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:56,156
I am. We all are. I'm sorry.

262
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,287
Now come here.

263
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,905
You really suck.

264
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,777
I do. I'm horrible,
unapproachable.
Now get into bed.

265
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,523
Put your head down on me.

266
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:16,611
Right.

267
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,489
I'm wicked and hateful
and indulgent.

268
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,145
Now go to sleep.

269
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,326
Fuck.

270
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:44,421
Some kind
of music was playing, faintly.

271
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:49,165
Some gothic folk something

272
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:53,474
just sort of warming
the background.

273
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,215
Candles were everywhere

274
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:59,306
like some kind
of artificial daylight

275
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:04,615
and we were completely entwined,

276
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,357
meshed like...

277
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,707
mmm, like one skin.

278
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:13,755
And she tilted her head back

279
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:18,673
and she had this amazing throat,

280
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,200
long like a Modigliani

281
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:29,684
and these sounds
start to escape from her

282
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,774
and it takes me a moment.

283
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:37,083
It took me a moment,
but I realized
she was saying something.

284
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,219
So I moved into her

285
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,614
and she was calling the angels.

286
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:51,053
She was summoning the thousands
of tiny unborn souls

287
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,447
that were circling us
at that moment,

288
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,231
whispering to be incarnated.

289
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:59,888
And I realized
this woman understands.

290
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:05,154
This woman knows that the child
has to be set free.

291
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:08,070
She holds the key
to our heart's existence.

292
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,812
And we're moving
like one animal now.

293
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,641
Strong and vascular

294
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,904
like deep chords of music.

295
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,517
And I just...lost it.

296
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,782
You came inside her?

297
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:28,351
Tell me you didn't come
inside her.

298
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,614
Not really.

299
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,007
Not really.

300
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,183
You pulled out?

301
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:37,447
At the last minute
I had a flash of clarity

302
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:40,407
and I thought,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

303
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:44,498
So I edged out a bit.

304
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:48,284
You edged out?
What does that mean?

305
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:52,506
I got out as soon as I realized
what I was doing.

306
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:56,031
You edged out? Did you pull out?
Did you pull it out in time?

307
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,946
I think I did, yes.

308
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,209
Why don't you
just wear a condom?

309
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,211
We've had this conversation.

310
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,220
What if you got
this woman pregnant?

311
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,787
I'd raise the child.

312
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,225
It would be mine. I don't have
a problem with that.

313
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,881
-How long have you known her?
-What difference does that make?

314
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,665
-How long?
-Tuesday.

315
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:25,234
-Last Tuesday?
-This Tuesday.

316
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,801
Two days?

317
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,891
That's two days,
and you're not wearing a condom.

318
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,981
What difference does it make?
There was a connection.

319
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,854
That only takes a second.
Besides, I want to be a father.

320
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,074
You are insane.

321
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,120
How are you going to be a father
when you're dead?

322
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,818
No one is dying.

323
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,733
They have a cocktail now.

324
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,997
I find out I have AIDS.
I get a few shots.

325
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,743
It's not even remotely
that simple.

326
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,050
How long have you known Erica?

327
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,530
Almost two years.

328
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,010
Do you ever talk about children?

329
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,316
I know you want
to have children.

330
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,841
It takes a long time
to get to know someone.

331
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,321
You had another fight
didn't you?

332
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,237
No.
Yes. No. I don't know.

333
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,239
I don't even know
if it's fighting anymore.

334
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,719
It's just become
the way we relate.

335
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,243
Well, that can't be good.

336
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,114
No.

337
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,507
I finished the mold.

338
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,599
So you think you two
will stay together?

339
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,601
Did you spray
that with clear coat?

340
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,169
-Shit, I forgot.
-Get me some thinner, 2%.

341
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,083
Yeah.

342
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,434
Oh, man! I'm really sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

343
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,523
That's all right.
I'm just a little rushed.

344
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:40,179
Verk wants to see a cast
of this thing by lunch tomorrow.

345
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,659
-That soon?
-Well, yeah it's a business.

346
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,054
This is an $8,000 rubber cooch
for Christ's sake.

347
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,103
-You look tired, Caleb.
-I am.

348
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,237
Spray the fucker.

349
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,985
â™ª

350
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:16,100
[phone ringing]

351
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,931
[machine clicks]

352
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,412
CALEB: Hi, this is Caleb.
You've reached
Morpheus Special Effects.

353
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,545
I'm not here right now,
so leave a message.

354
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,111
[beep]

355
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,852
WOMAN [on machine]:
Hello, Caleb. This is Camille.

356
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,855
Yeah.

357
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,814
I read about your guest house
in the paper.

358
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,903
I'm very intrigued.

359
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,862
Caleb, that's a beautiful name.

360
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,038
It's from the Bible, isn't it?

361
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,953
Caleb.

362
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,173
I'd love to know more about you,
Caleb, when you get a chance.

363
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,218
-[beep]
-I'm a sculptor.

364
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,047
Well, an effects technician,
really.

365
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,485
Hello? Hello?

366
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,317
You want to see the guest house?

367
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:02,625
Wait. You want to rent it?

368
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,801
Look, I should tell you.
It's--it's very--

369
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:07,935
No, trust me, please,
it's very small.

370
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,375
It's in the valley.

371
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:17,814
Yeah. I, uh, I could give you
the address.

372
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:20,121
Mm-hmm. Could I just ask you

373
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,992
what it is you do?

374
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:25,822
No, for a living.

375
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,216
You--you're a sculptor?

376
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,957
Sorry?

377
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,612
A sculptress.

378
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,788
[click]

379
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:50,586
MAN: And she said she'd take it
just like that?

380
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:51,761
That's what she said.

381
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,415
Did you tell her
how small it is?

382
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,330
Never got the chance.

383
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:57,288
What is she going to do,
live there by herself?

384
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,942
She's a sculptor.

385
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,641
She sells her pieces out
of her dad's gallery near Davis.

386
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,470
She just needs
room for herself and the clay.

387
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,385
[sighs]
Man, you are so lucky.

388
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,604
What do you mean?

389
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:09,866
Don't you realize who this is?

390
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,825
-Jason.
-Caleb.

391
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:15,524
This is your angel, man.
This is the one.

392
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,353
No questions.
Total commitment to the space.

393
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,400
A sculptor.
What more do you want?

394
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,141
-What's her name?
-I don't even want to tell you.

395
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,882
Why not?

396
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:27,318
Promise me
you won't make it mean anything.

397
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,410
Camille.

398
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,063
Oh, my God!

399
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:36,676
Fuck. I got to go.
What time is it?

400
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,069
It's 20 to 12:00.

401
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,028
I got to go. I got to meet
Richard Verk in half an hour.

402
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,899
How did the thing turn out?

403
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,206
Well, we'll see.

404
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,687
Caleb...

405
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:50,167
this is a magnificent time
to be alive.

406
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,320
Caleb, Janice.
We spoke on the phone.
Please, sit down.

407
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:19,327
This is Richard Verk.

408
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,896
Do you need an iced tea?

409
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,637
Do I need one?

410
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,203
Another iced tea, por favor.

411
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,727
That's so rude.

412
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:30,251
What's rude?
I assume he speak Spanish.

413
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,906
-You should never assume.
-Children, children.

414
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,125
Let's not squabble
over such non-issues.

415
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,606
There, you see
the beverages arrived?

416
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,260
Now, everybody may
refresh themselves.

417
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:47,486
[police siren passes by]

418
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:54,362
Well, let's get down
to business.

419
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,277
Have you brought it with you?

420
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:59,367
-I'm sorry, what?
-The thing, the prize,

421
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,370
the great compromise
that's kept me up all hours,

422
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,025
nearly ruining
my artistic vision.

423
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:07,593
Do you have it?

424
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:11,422
Oh, the thing.
Yes, yes, I have it.
I have it right here.

425
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,425
Well, may I see it?

426
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,688
Here?

427
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,908
I have to avenge with it.

428
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:24,566
Now? Right--right now?

429
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,002
Is there a problem, Caleb?

430
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,830
Did they bring this sweetener
for your tea?

431
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,440
Oh, I don't--
I don't need anything.

432
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,747
No, there's no problem.
I just thought Mr. Verk would--

433
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,880
Please. Call him Richard.

434
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,403
Call me Richard.

435
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,231
Richard,

436
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,711
would like to see it in a more--

437
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,931
or rather less--public arena.

438
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,413
Arena?

439
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,721
You used the word arena.
That's very interesting.

440
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,898
An arena, as in a circus.

441
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,074
That's apropos really.

442
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,338
This is like a circus.

443
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,689
A laughless circus.

444
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,562
If this is indeed an arena,

445
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,608
this place a stage
for spectacle and daring.

446
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,916
Show us your act, Caleb.

447
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:11,178
Join us.

448
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:15,225
Will you join our circus, Caleb?

449
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,935
Oh, my God.

450
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,808
Yes.

451
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,505
Let me look at it.

452
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:40,033
Oh, that is disgusting.

453
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,470
Oh no it's not.
Quite the contrary.

454
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,690
It's a compliment really.

455
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,388
He rendered it so lifelike.

456
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:51,218
I just assumed it must emit
some odor, however faint.

457
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,569
Do you want have a look
at it, Henry?

458
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,007
No thank you, Richard.
I don't have much experience
with those.

459
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,923
Hmm. Really it's lovely.

460
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:04,274
-It's so light.
-It's high-density silicone.

461
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:06,537
It's a little warm
to wear but strong.

462
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,974
That's something, isn't it?

463
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,498
I guess.

464
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,066
Good Lord.
It really is lovely.

465
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,937
It's remarkable.

466
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:18,027
Maybe I should do
a "comedia del'arte" piece.

467
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,770
I could have all the actors
wear this sex on their faces.

468
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,729
HENRY:
It's time to be getting back--

469
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,426
I've got a meeting with Anna.

470
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,819
RICHARD:
You know I really am impressed.

471
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,429
A little too impressed,
actually.

472
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,824
It's lovely,
but it's another movie entirely.

473
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,652
Seeing it now,

474
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:37,003
I realized that I really need
something a bit more O'Keefe.

475
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,179
Georgia O'Keefe?

476
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,528
Exactly.

477
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,095
You're so bright.

478
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:45,968
You've seen them, those lovely,
strong water colors.

479
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,927
Orchids and lilies,

480
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,625
like great breathing vaginas.

481
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,497
Uh, yeah.

482
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,456
Yeah, that's more what we need.

483
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,154
This is a bit too...

484
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,982
on the nose.

485
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,984
Are you with me?

486
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:05,596
Uh...well, actually, heh.

487
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,252
I was under the impression that
this piece was going to work

488
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,820
in about 1/8 of a second
of film,

489
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,735
just when she uncrosses
her legs.

490
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,694
How did you know that?

491
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,566
It was in the job order.
I read the script.

492
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,742
-Where did you get a script?
-You read the script?

493
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,353
I want the option, Caleb,

494
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,965
to discover, if necessary.

495
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,750
OK. I'm sorry.

496
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:31,492
-No, no, it's all right.
-It can be fixed.

497
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:35,365
It's going to have to be fitted.

498
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,759
Yes, yes.
Have you met Anna McCaphrey?

499
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,893
-No.
-You have Friday free?

500
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,416
Friday it is.

501
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,593
I'm sorry I don't think
I can make Friday.

502
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,856
Is there some sort of problem?

503
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:52,295
I have a...
well, I have a thing on Friday.

504
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:54,254
What sort of thing?

505
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:57,344
Can't we do it any other day?

506
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,128
No.

507
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,695
This is important, Caleb.

508
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,611
This is the show.

509
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,528
What do you have?
If you don't mind my query.

510
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,530
Oh, well...

511
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,708
my--my grandmother just died.

512
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,492
She died a few days ago,

513
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:18,234
and well,
the funeral is this Friday.

514
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:19,453
You were very close?

515
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,889
-Not really.
-Then it's settled.

516
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,635
I'll talk to Anna's assistant.
She'll get in touch with you.

517
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,028
But I told my mother--

518
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,988
Caleb, it's really very simple.

519
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,775
This business is
about sacrifice.

520
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,038
Let me tell you a little story.

521
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,040
My mother
missed my high school graduation

522
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,998
because she had to be backstage
for opening night

523
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,391
for one of her clients.

524
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,481
Now, at the time,
I was heartbroken.

525
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,614
But that actress went on
to win the Tony Award

526
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,268
for the best performance.

527
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,445
I always felt a little
responsible for that.

528
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:58,492
When I got married
she had a similar conflict.

529
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:02,322
But that actor won
the People's Choice Award
and a Golden Globe.

530
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,629
Two weeks later, I got a gift
basket with some bath salts,

531
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,937
and a typed note that says,
"Sure you'll be happy.

532
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:11,026
Hope it lasts. Mom."

533
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,683
But four years ago
when she died,

534
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,208
I was on the set
of Richard Verk's
breakthrough film,

535
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:23,038
The Right to Remain Silent.
I couldn't make the funeral

536
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,693
but that film did
over a $130 domestic

537
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,956
and three times that foreign.

538
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:32,831
Sacrifice is what has made
all of these tremendous things
possible.

539
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,007
Now trust me.
I know it's harsh.

540
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,705
But this is your moment
to shine.

541
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,838
It may not come again,

542
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,623
either you want it or you don't.

543
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,756
Do you have my number?

544
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,759
Of course.

545
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,066
Caleb.

546
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,373
This could lead to other things.

547
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:54,635
Sure.

548
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,253
Hi.

549
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,864
I didn't hear you.

550
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,648
Well, that's because you were
listening to the clay.

551
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,869
I thought you might be hungry.

552
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,827
Christ, that's quite a feast.

553
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,655
Yes, well,
and I delivered it myself.

554
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,265
I assume if you're following
the usual pattern

555
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,137
you haven't eaten yet.

556
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,661
You assumed correct, my lady.

557
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,056
Well, so stop your trifling
over there.

558
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:27,537
Come join me
in this most exquisite repast.

559
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,278
Where do you want to eat?

560
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,454
Well, over here on the table
of course.

561
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:34,980
Where you create,
we shall nourish ourselves.

562
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,334
What's this for?

563
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:42,901
Same thing.

564
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:46,600
Oh, are they doing 
Little Shop of Horrorsnow?

565
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,908
I had a meeting with Verk.
He said he wanted some changes.

566
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,171
-I guess he wanted the option.
-Option to what?

567
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,824
Break into songs
about fertilizer?

568
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,914
Actually, it had something to do
with artistic vision,

569
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,654
whatever that means.

570
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,830
Hey, didn't you have
a callback today?

571
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,267
Now why would you want
to go ruin

572
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,269
this lovely old evening
with talk like that?

573
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,532
Was it that bad?

574
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:07,186
Picture this.

575
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:11,016
I walk into a room
with every faux-chested,

576
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,366
collagen-lipped actress
in Hollywood.

577
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,064
Some of them even have these
little futuristic outfits on,

578
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:19,763
so I'm feeling really lame
in this dress.

579
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,504
I sit down,
start going over the sides.

580
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,246
The casting assistant,
she squeaks out
of her little office

581
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:27,075
and she hands me
another set of slides.

582
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,598
Well, now I'm feeling
pretty good, right?

583
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,732
No outfit,
but I put an extra set of slides

584
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,734
which is more than these
silicone losers have.

585
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:37,781
Then I looked down and I see it.

586
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:40,784
"Engine technician one."

587
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,961
OK, scroll to cross the page.

588
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:46,138
Well, time folded right then
and there and I saw myself,

589
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:49,663
40 years old with bad caps doing
dinner theater in Michigan.

590
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:53,232
I thought this is it, I'm out.

591
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:56,539
This is not what
six years living in New York

592
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,020
fighting winters
and roaches and assholes

593
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,979
with too much hair gel
was all about.

594
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,894
You have two years
with the best acting teacher
in the country, Caleb.

595
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,506
Working for tips
on Christmas eve,

596
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:09,248
auditioning for any part
that like might have a line,

597
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,380
wear that fucking
chicken costume in front
of Madison Square Garden.

598
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,904
Oh, my God.
Why am I going there?

599
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,734
Anyway, I had an epiphany.

600
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,475
I'm quitting.

601
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah I'm going to be doing
photography full-time.

602
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,480
I already lined up a couple
of suckers for headshots.

603
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,309
So, that's it.

604
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,528
I'm happy.

605
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,316
Wow. That's a lot of change
for one day.

606
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,752
Yeah, well, not really.

607
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,364
I mean,
it's been coming in a long time.

608
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,888
I'm just--I'm sick of doing
what doesn't make me happy

609
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,629
in the hope that someday
it might.

610
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:45,588
That's amazing.
And I'm really proud of you.

611
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,982
-To the unknown.
-To the unknown.

612
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,684
I missed you.

613
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,686
I really missed you.

614
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:02,953
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for all my shit.

615
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,086
You know, it's like
I get so scared.

616
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,175
I get so scared.
I get so wrapped up.
And I could get--

617
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,569
I know, it's OK.

618
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,355
I want you to know
how much I treasure you, Caleb.

619
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,922
I'd get you.

620
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,318
God, I'm so glad you were born.

621
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,543
[metal clanging]

622
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,939
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

623
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,941
Well, I'm trying to--
this table is very uneven.

624
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,985
OK.
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

625
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,074
Let me rotate down a little.

626
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,379
-Ouch
-Aw.

627
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,641
-Shit.
-What?

628
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:39,860
My knees are, like, digging
into this table.

629
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,774
OK. All right, hey, turn over.

630
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,384
No, this is fine.

631
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,952
Oh, it's not fine.
Look at your face.

632
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,996
You look like you're
doing your income tax.

633
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,347
-Well, I'm in pain.
-OK, then stop.

634
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,784
But you wanted to.
Don't make this about me, OK.

635
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,221
You were right there with me.

636
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:55,049
Oh, let's forget it.

637
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,920
Oh, my God.
Did you lose your erection?

638
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,748
Jesus!

639
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,794
Well, did you? It's not
like anybody's here to hear us.

640
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:03,405
Well, obviously for not fucking,
I've lost my erection.

641
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:06,582
-All right, God, calm down.
-Let's just forget it.

642
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:09,324
It's all right.

643
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,370
God, it's all right.

644
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,719
I can masturbate.

645
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,634
No.

646
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,505
Why not? I'm horny.

647
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,594
What are you like some kind
of spy missile?

648
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,858
You get a program in
and you have to carry it out
no matter what?

649
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,512
Hey that's just mean, all right?

650
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:24,992
I didn't throw you losing
your erection in your face.

651
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,082
-Yes, you did.
-Well, I just mentioned it.

652
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,302
Can't you just not do
that right now?

653
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,652
Can't we just be together?

654
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,958
I don't see
what the big deal is.

655
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,569
I feel like an ornament
or something.

656
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,092
I mean you go off
and please yourself

657
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,789
while I'm over here staring
at the fucking ceiling.

658
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,314
OK. OK. OK, honey. Come here.
You can do it for me.

659
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,359
I'm sorry, I'm just--

660
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,579
I'm just not in the mood.

661
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,147
So that
means I shouldn't be either?

662
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,323
No. That means that out of
consideration for me,

663
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:55,022
for what I'm feeling,
you'll just not do that.

664
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,504
I'm sorry. I really,
I thought our relationship was

665
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,462
like a whole different kind
of relationship.

666
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:01,985
-Well, what does that mean?
-Well, I just thought

667
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,596
that we could be ourselves
around one another,

668
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:06,207
you know, and not hide
behind any bullshit premises.

669
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,427
Hey, I don't think what
I'm feeling is bullshit, Erica.

670
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,646
I'm asking you not to masturbate
in front of me.

671
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,300
Is that so difficult
to understand?

672
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,041
OK and I am asking you
for the freedom and support

673
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,261
that I thought
this relationship was built on.

674
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,612
Look, if you want to play
with yourself so bad,
then play with yourself!

675
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:22,658
Oh, my God.
Why does this always happen?

676
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,791
Why? It's like we disagree.
And instead of it just being

677
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,358
what it is
it becomes this whole thing,

678
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:29,622
-you know, full of meaning.
-These are my feelings, Erica.

679
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,885
Yes,
they're your feelings, Caleb.
Well, I have feelings too.

680
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,279
God, why are your feelings
more important than mine?

681
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:37,020
That's not what I'm saying,
all right?

682
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:39,458
Making love takes two people.
Two people have to be involved.

683
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:43,070
Who says?
It's just sex, OK?

684
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,115
I mean that's it.
People can make it mean
whatever they want.

685
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,074
They can fuck.
They can make love.

686
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,859
One person can masturbate
the other can watch.
Whatever, you know.

687
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,427
I mean, it all comes
down to what you make it mean.

688
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,603
I don't know.
I don't believe that.

689
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,388
I think it does mean something

690
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,955
when another person is present,
it means something.

691
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,219
Oh? That's very interesting
coming from a guy

692
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,570
who carts a rubber vagina
around town for a living.

693
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,963
-Fuck you.
-Why?

694
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,878
That has nothing to do
with anything.

695
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,750
Why not? I mean the act is
so sacred to you

696
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,754
I thought the parts that
went along with it would be too.

697
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,104
I don't even know what
we're talking about anymore.

698
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,584
OK. You know what then?

699
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:21,239
Come here.

700
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,763
Let's not talk about it.

701
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,071
-Are you mad?
-Uh-uh.

702
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:31,640
I just think
we have some issues.

703
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,991
Well, if it's me, I'm sorry.

704
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:38,299
If it's you?
Is that, I'm sorry,

705
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,519
is that you trying to take
responsibility or something?

706
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,477
God, I'm so sick of this shit.

707
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:45,001
Look, I'm sorry I just have
a lot on my mind.

708
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:48,309
I got an early meeting with
Anna McCaphrey in the morning.

709
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,876
You're meeting Anna McCaphrey?

710
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,227
Well, yeah, I got to fit her
with the prosthesis.

711
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,230
Why do you have to meet her?

712
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,058
Well, I guess
I could reach my measuring tape

713
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,973
around her body
and never introduce myself

714
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:02,671
but it's not the best way
to have a client relationship.

715
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,413
Oh so now she's a client?

716
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,154
Well, yeah she's wearing
the thing.

717
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,548
I am sorry. I thought you're
in a meeting with Verk.

718
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,289
I thought you were working
with Verk.

719
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,291
Hey, don't make
this mean anything, Erica.

720
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,685
Are you going to her house?

721
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:19,035
I don't know, whatever is
convenient for her, I guess.

722
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,342
Do you want to go to her house?

723
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,954
I don't care.
I just want to do the job,
get it over with, get paid.

724
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,434
Aren't you curious?

725
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:28,175
-About what?
-How she must live a rich,

726
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,352
gorgeous, terrible actress
like her.

727
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,573
Whew! She must have
a horror show for a house.

728
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:37,489
I don't think
she's a bad actress.

729
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,839
Oh puhlease, did you see her
in The Right to Remain Silent?

730
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,537
Did you for one second, buy her
as a cop with all the hair?

731
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:46,324
"Hey freeze, assholes.
You have the right
to remain silent."

732
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:47,629
The way she would like leave
her gun here,

733
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,153
I mean she's
like a mud-wrestling fantasy.

734
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,504
She had some moments
in that other thing she did.

735
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,376
Oh yeah right,
the waitress thing.
Come please!

736
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,944
The woman's not waited a table
in her life.

737
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,251
-You don't know that.
-She's limited at best.

738
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,342
You're not the same type
so you shouldn't worry about it.

739
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,303
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

740
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:12,350
You're nothing like each other,
that's all.

741
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,136
Why? Because I won't flash
my twat and flip my hair

742
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,312
a thousand times
for a camera crew?

743
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,098
Look,
what difference does it make?

744
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,840
You quit.

745
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:27,234
That's right.

746
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,280
I quit.

747
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,108
I'm entitled to my opinion.

748
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:39,289
[vehicle approaches]

749
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,034
-[thunder]
-Shit.

750
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:53,652
Hello.

751
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:54,957
Sorry.

752
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:56,829
I waited.

753
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,875
Right. Oh you're--
you're Camille, right?

754
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,660
Yeah.

755
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,358
OK. You want to come inside?

756
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:15,848
You really don't have
to show me the place.

757
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,763
I know what I want it.
I have all my stuff.

758
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,417
Yeah, you brought everything?

759
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,331
Yeah.

760
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,986
You're serious?

761
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,075
You haven't even seen it.

762
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:29,296
I have money.

763
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,778
Well, that's good but I'd like
to know something about you.

764
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,694
I knew everything
about you from your voice.

765
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:38,436
Oh.

766
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:40,568
Where did you live last?

767
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,440
At home.

768
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,616
Did you make these sculptures?

769
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,314
Yeah.
Did you pay rent there?

770
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,059
They're just
how I imagined them.

771
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,716
You work from your dreams too.

772
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,328
Yes, sometimes.

773
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,636
All the time.

774
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,378
Have--have you lived
any place else?

775
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,904
No.
No other place seemed right.

776
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,950
Do you want to help me unpack
my things? I don't have much.

777
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:17,431
I don't know.
I got to think about this.

778
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:20,565
-Why?
-Well, you know, we just--

779
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,393
Does somebody else want
to live there?

780
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,439
Oh no, no.

781
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,920
I can't even get people
to look inside of it.

782
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,138
I have money.

783
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,751
It's, um...

784
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:37,320
first and last and security.

785
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,846
Right.

786
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:46,765
Well...show you the place.

787
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:08,395
It's perfect.

788
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,658
It's just how I imagined it.

789
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,749
Oh, glad you like it.

790
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,751
-One room.
-Sorry?

791
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:19,449
One room.

792
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,409
It's like the center of a body.

793
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,891
It's like a perfect seashell.

794
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:29,372
Great bloodless heart.

795
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,247
[exhales]

796
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,305
Sit down.

797
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:50,568
OK.

798
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:05,017
Do you remember
when you were little?

799
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:08,281
You could look on something
for hours and hours

800
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:12,024
and see all different shapes
inside the one thing.

801
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:14,026
Yeah.

802
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:17,333
You could look
at a candle flame or a rose bud

803
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:19,640
and see world
after world inside it.

804
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:26,516
And the deeper you looked

805
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,390
the less you felt like yourself.

806
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,958
You felt like the flame
or the flower.

807
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,440
It's so simple.

808
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,575
What's it like now?

809
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,537
It's different.

810
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,367
It's harder.

811
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:59,158
Listen, I'm going to go.

812
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:01,421
But if you need anything

813
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:02,988
I'm just in that front house,
OK?

814
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:04,554
OK.

815
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,426
OK.

816
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:07,557
[door creaks closes]

817
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,429
I need something.

818
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,213
You do?

819
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,520
I need you
to keep talking to me.

820
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,871
-Keep telling me things.
-We don't even know each other.

821
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,222
Not yet,
but it's becoming clear.

822
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:42,331
How did you know
that I work from my dreams?

823
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:46,335
Same way anyone would,
by looking at your work.

824
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,903
A lot of people
have seen my work.

825
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:52,211
Heh. Yeah. But how many
have actually looked at it?

826
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,476
I don't know.
Maybe you're the first.

827
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:05,180
When a sculpture of mine
wants to be born,

828
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,227
I get a visit
from the moth fairy.

829
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:13,058
Moth fairy?

830
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:16,322
She only comes to me
late at night

831
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:18,803
and only on certain nights.

832
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:23,155
When my heart is in love with my
mind and my mind becomes full.

833
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:27,072
Then she lights on my pillow

834
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,031
and she tells me in her little
winged voice what it's to be.

835
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,255
The hardest part is remembering.

836
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:42,827
Remembering the feeling
when you first find out
what you're about to make.

837
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:48,484
Once you have that,
the rest just follows.

838
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,922
[thunder]

839
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:55,840
It's all there really is.

840
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,407
I think we were born
with everything

841
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:01,628
and then the world starts
to fill us up, and we forget.

842
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,726
You actually make your living
selling your artwork.

843
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:14,336
You're funny.

844
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,208
Heh.

845
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,732
That makes it more real to you,
doesn't it?

846
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:24,477
If people would part
with their money

847
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,174
to possess
what they already have

848
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:29,612
but have forgotten they have,

849
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:33,312
yeah, people buy it.

850
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:35,662
I'm on a two-year backorder.

851
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,533
Really?

852
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:38,796
Yeah.

853
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,369
You can work magic, Caleb.

854
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:54,637
That hasn't been my experience.

855
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:56,030
First you have to believe it.

856
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:14,005
[thunder]

857
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,168
What are you smiling about?
You're fucking radiant.

858
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:49,518
-Oh, my God.
-What? What happened?

859
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,129
You'll never believe
what I did last night.

860
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:52,782
Do I know her?

861
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,175
Oh, my God!
This is so not like me.

862
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,481
-Bullshit, what happened?
-Camille.

863
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:56,961
And she moves in just like that.

864
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:58,136
Really?

865
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,399
She starts talking to me, right,

866
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:01,661
talking to me like she knows me
and understands me.

867
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,532
She sells her sculptures.

868
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:07,275
She has this moth fairy thing.
She makes magic happen...

869
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:08,886
And you fucked her, right?

870
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:12,063
No, but we kiss,
and it was incredible.

871
00:48:12,193 --> 00:48:14,717
I didn't know
what I was doing or why.
We just meshed together.

872
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:17,459
This sounds more like you.
Have you told Erica yet?

873
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,027
Fuck, no. I have to do that.

874
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:21,594
Why?

875
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:24,466
Because we have
a relationship based on trust.

876
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:26,729
Caleb, you spent last night dry
humping the moth fairly lady,

877
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,210
I think any trust
you might have had is broken.

878
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:31,517
Fuck, fuck you're right.

879
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:33,475
I'll tell her later.
What time is it?

880
00:48:33,606 --> 00:48:35,303
It's almost 10:00.

881
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,090
Where are you rushing off
to now?

882
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,527
I got a call from
Anna McCaphrey's assistant
this morning.

883
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:44,486
She says I got to be at
her house by 2:30.

884
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:47,228
-Is this normal?
-I don't know. You want to go?

885
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,795
Fuck no.
This is why you're the boss.

886
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,754
-I could make you.
-You're right. You could.

887
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:52,755
But you're not that kind
of boss.

888
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:54,888
Just go. You'll walk in there,

889
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,411
she'll be completely charmed
by you.

890
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,326
Either of that,
or you'll piss her off,

891
00:48:58,457 --> 00:48:59,458
and you'll never work
in this town again.

892
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:00,894
What difference does it make?

893
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:02,983
It will be
an interesting experience.

894
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:06,160
â™ª

895
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:57,516
Hello.

896
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,737
[birds chirping]

897
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:04,871
Hello.

898
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:13,401
Perfect.

899
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:16,317
â™ª

900
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:40,559
Hey, you can't park
the car here, pal.

901
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:41,951
I'm only going to be a second.

902
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:44,171
Sorry, you can't park
the car here.

903
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:46,130
Please, I just have
this little thing I have to do,
and then I'll be out of here.

904
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,740
I just need to find
Anna McCaphrey.

905
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,307
I wish I could help you.
You can't park the car here.

906
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,265
-I'll pay you.
-Oh, great.

907
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:55,095
I will pay you $20
if you let me park my car here
for five minutes.

908
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,663
Shit, OK $5, but it's still
a dollar a minute.

909
00:50:57,793 --> 00:50:59,447
Look, pal,
I wish I could help you out,

910
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:01,493
but I could really lose my job.
You can't park your car here.

911
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,495
-Janice, Janice.
-Where the hell have you been?

912
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,931
Two hours late.

913
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,412
I was told to meet
at Anna McCaphrey's house.

914
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:08,587
You cannot park your car here.

915
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:09,544
Give me your keys.

916
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:11,198
-What?
-Keys.

917
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:12,982
Park it in the crew lot.

918
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,073
Bitch.

919
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:21,165
This is really unprofessional
behavior, Caleb.

920
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:22,949
Verk is having
a fucking coronary.

921
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,298
I was told to meet at her house.

922
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:25,256
Did you check your service?

923
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:26,605
-Yes.
-Recently?

924
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:27,823
I don't know. I checked
before I left my house.

925
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,303
You got to be more
on top of things, Caleb.

926
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:31,349
Things change at light speed
in this business.

927
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:33,351
-You should know that.
-I'm sorry.

928
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:35,135
Richard is going
to go ballistic.

929
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:36,397
He's probably going to make me
listen to that damn story

930
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:38,747
about his cockney childhood
again.

931
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:42,403
You know, he had me
so tense at our live show,
I stopped having my period.

932
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,666
What am I saying?
Why am I telling you this?

933
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:47,887
I don't know. It's OK.
My mother had a similar problem.

934
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:50,237
Your mother?

935
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:53,893
Really?
Now I'm like your mother?

936
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:55,895
Oh, terrific.

937
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,854
-No, I didn't mean it like--
-I know. I know. I know.

938
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:02,162
Look, I'm not usually like this.
I'm a very compassionate person.

939
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:15,915
I want you to know
that no matter what happens,

940
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:17,221
I think that you're more likely
than not

941
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:20,180
a very pleasant young man.

942
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:23,227
I'm not really sure what it is
that you do or how you do it.

943
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:26,882
But I'm sure that you're
very good at whatever it is
that you do

944
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:29,755
and you'll be
however good you can be.

945
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:31,757
OK?

946
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:34,194
OK, showtime.

947
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:37,241
Come on, come on.

948
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:44,639
I see the messenger
is finally here.

949
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,467
I'm really sorry.

950
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,600
Don't grovel.
Did you at least bring it
with you?

951
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:56,999
Oh! That is fabulous.
My goodness, well done.

952
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:00,046
All right then, my boy.
Bring her in!

953
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,179
VERK: Bring her in.

954
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:03,658
Vera.

955
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,618
Vera!

956
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:09,490
Put Vera back on,
you little bastard.

957
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:11,971
Vera sweetie, what did we talk
about the last time

958
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,494
I came in for a facial?

959
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,888
No, I will remind you.

960
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,672
Organic cucumbers.

961
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:19,544
Yes, it's important,

962
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:21,502
because the store-bought ones
are yucky and burn me.

963
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,896
Well, I am telling you
they've burned me.

964
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:27,378
You put those little pieces
of store-bought cucumbers
in my eyes again,

965
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:30,381
I will have immigration
on your ass so fast you won't
have time for a fucking Belini!

966
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,209
Damn it.

967
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,428
What the fuck is going on?
I still have 1/2 an hour
in make up.

968
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,125
All right, just shut up.
Don't be a tart.

969
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,476
I have a surprise for you.

970
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:40,739
I've spent many
a sleepless night

971
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,220
pondering your adamant refusal
to do the pussy shot.

972
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,134
Frankly, I believe
that every young starlet

973
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,311
should have at least one
tastefully lit pussy shot.
But that's just me.

974
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,008
Richie. Richie, we have
talked about this.

975
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:51,532
Either get me a body double,
or make a piece.

976
00:53:51,663 --> 00:53:54,709
I guess I have taken
your suggestions too heart.

977
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,886
We may now dispel the rumor that
I don't listen to my actors.

978
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:01,063
By way of reconciliation
and in the dire hope of getting

979
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:03,022
this film back on schedule
and near budget,

980
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:05,851
I offer you this, a compromise.

981
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:12,510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Richie.

982
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,294
Strap it on. Strap it on.
Strap it on.

983
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:15,426
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

984
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:20,126
Whoa. Am I sexy?

985
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,477
You look like a rhododendron.

986
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:26,915
Either that or you have
the worst yeast infection
in history.

987
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:30,092
Oh God, Richie,
you're fucking nuts.

988
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:31,659
Yes, I always will be.

989
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,922
-I love you.
-By the way,

990
00:54:34,053 --> 00:54:37,186
that is the most expensive
flower I've ever bought a woman.

991
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:39,754
Muah!

992
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:43,671
-ANNA: Look at me! Look at me!
-Back to work.

993
00:54:43,802 --> 00:54:46,239
ANNA: Freeze, asshole, you have
the right to remain silent.

994
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:50,199
MAN: All right everybody
back to number one.

995
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,376
This is for you.

996
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:54,987
They never were going to use it,
were they?

997
00:54:55,117 --> 00:54:56,858
You've been good sport.

998
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:03,082
You know,
you have no idea how hard
I worked on that.

999
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,174
Oh, yes, I do.

1000
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,355
[door closes]

1001
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:18,227
[thunder]

1002
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:31,632
Jesus!

1003
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:34,243
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

1004
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:35,419
It's all right.

1005
00:55:38,596 --> 00:55:41,120
What are you doing?

1006
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,644
Do you think I can get an
advance on next week's salary?

1007
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,733
Sure, what for?

1008
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:49,346
I just had some expenses
this month I didn't anticipate.

1009
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:50,999
How much do you think
you'll need?

1010
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,827
However much you can spare.

1011
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,699
How much?

1012
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:57,702
I don't know. 300?

1013
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,921
Sure.

1014
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:02,794
You need it right now?
What's wrong?

1015
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:04,361
It's nothing.

1016
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:07,799
I just--I got this--
this thing I got to do.

1017
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,715
What thing?

1018
00:56:10,845 --> 00:56:13,892
You want to tell me about it?

1019
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:16,547
Will you just listen to me,
no lectures or anything?

1020
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,200
What did you do?

1021
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:21,334
Will you just be my friend
and listen to me?

1022
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:22,553
Yeah.

1023
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,644
[sighs]

1024
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:35,000
That girl I was telling
you about...

1025
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,046
she's late.

1026
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:42,573
She's late, and she's just
going ahead like I don't
even fucking exist.

1027
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:49,275
She calls me last week,
says she has some news.

1028
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,060
And I knew--I knew what it was.

1029
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:58,371
So we meet at this Thai place
near at her house.

1030
00:56:58,502 --> 00:56:59,938
She says she's late.

1031
00:57:02,288 --> 00:57:04,769
So we finish our seafood soup.

1032
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:06,901
And we go to the mini mart.

1033
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:09,600
We buy a pregnancy test

1034
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,690
and some gum, I think,

1035
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,258
and we go to her place.
Now her roommate's
in the shower,

1036
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:18,130
so we have to wait to get
into the bathroom.

1037
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:24,963
So she sits down,
and she pees on the stick,

1038
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:29,533
and her roommates blasting
some speed metal or some shit.

1039
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:34,929
And I see
this little blue cross appear.

1040
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:42,459
And something just goes off,
inside me.

1041
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,985
And I hand her the stick.

1042
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:50,075
And she starts crying,

1043
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:53,252
but all I can think about
is this--

1044
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:56,821
is this--this life--

1045
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,345
this life that's begun,

1046
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:04,176
this little life that's with us
in a Los Angeles bathroom

1047
00:58:04,306 --> 00:58:07,658
with the music blasting
and the mother crying,

1048
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:09,964
and the father wishing.

1049
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:15,056
And I realize it's doomed.

1050
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:21,585
I look at her,
and I don't see a mother.

1051
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:23,978
I see a girl.

1052
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:27,678
And I look inside myself,

1053
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:30,376
and I know I'm not ready either.

1054
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,511
And I don't know what to do,

1055
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,730
because I...

1056
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:40,517
I want that little weight
on my shoulders, you know,

1057
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:44,390
and I want those--those
little eyes that close

1058
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,435
with a kiss goodnight.

1059
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:51,310
And I want that little person,
you know,

1060
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,226
and I can't have it.

1061
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,229
And that makes
the wanting worse.

1062
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,493
[sighs]

1063
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:10,111
You want me to drive you
down there or anything?

1064
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,638
No, no, I just...

1065
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:17,989
I just wanted you to listen.

1066
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,862
And you did that...very well.

1067
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,593
[phone ringing inside]

1068
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:11,825
[on machine]
Hi, this is Caleb.

1069
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:13,914
I'm not home right now.
But if you leave a message,

1070
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:16,090
I'll call you back.
Thanks. Bye.

1071
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:19,833
[beep]

1072
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:23,620
WOMAN: Caleb?
Honey, are you there?

1073
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:28,015
Well, I guess
you're probably still at work.

1074
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:31,497
I just wanted you to know that
the funeral was beautiful

1075
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,717
and everyone asked about you.

1076
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:35,327
Honey, I wanted to tell you

1077
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:38,286
that I really understand
why you couldn't come today.

1078
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,332
I know how important
your work is,

1079
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:42,203
and I'm so proud of you.

1080
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,641
I love you. I guess that's--

1081
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:46,338
[beep]

1082
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,825
Hi.

1083
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:58,872
Wow. You look sad.

1084
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:04,486
I just need you to show me
how my key works again.

1085
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:07,185
You just stick it in the lock
and turn it.

1086
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:10,231
I know.
I keep getting it wrong.

1087
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:12,277
Are you OK?

1088
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,192
Not really.

1089
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:16,194
Maybe you could talk to me.

1090
01:01:16,324 --> 01:01:17,630
Let's go open your door.

1091
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:19,676
Well, you could talk
to me though.

1092
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:26,160
I don't know what to say.

1093
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,075
Don't say anything.

1094
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:37,302
[vehicle approaches]

1095
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,975
[sighs]

1096
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,633
[sniffles]

1097
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:17,472
The tears of an artist
are very precious.

1098
01:02:17,603 --> 01:02:20,084
They're supposed
to bring vivid dreams.

1099
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,481
â™ª

1100
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,199
[knocking at door]

1101
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:49,766
I'll get it.

1102
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,898
[sniffles]

1103
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:58,992
Yeah, hi.

1104
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,606
Oh, fuck.

1105
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:07,131
-Hi.
-Hi.

1106
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,004
Aren't you going
to say anything?

1107
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:14,486
-I should go.
-No. Oh, no. Stay.

1108
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:15,704
Erica.

1109
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,663
This involves her.

1110
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,492
You were--you were the one
tongue diving my boyfriend
just now, right?

1111
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:22,059
Yeah.

1112
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:22,973
Yeah, that's what I thought.
So you can stay.

1113
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,192
This is bullshit.

1114
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,194
[exhales]
Why do we all sit down.

1115
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:33,505
Camille, isn't it? Yeah? Sit.

1116
01:03:33,635 --> 01:03:36,856
You're so calm. I'd be a mess.

1117
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:40,077
Well, sweetie, that's the
difference between you and me.

1118
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:41,861
Sit down.

1119
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:50,652
Erica, we should do this,
just you and me.

1120
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,046
Let me ask you something.

1121
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:55,396
Are you aware
of the responsibility

1122
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:58,182
that you have just taken on?

1123
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,836
What do you mean?

1124
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:01,881
Well, you've just decided
to become significant

1125
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:04,057
in the life of my boyfriend.

1126
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:06,190
Did you--
did you intend to do that?

1127
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,062
I don't know.

1128
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:11,282
Do you know
that you have a choice?

1129
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:14,024
That you can use your sexuality
responsibility,

1130
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:16,678
and then not to get attention?

1131
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:18,811
-No.
-Erica.

1132
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:21,770
No she needs to know this.

1133
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,860
OK.

1134
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:27,037
Tell me what happened
before I got here.

1135
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,213
I came in to get him to let me
into my house.

1136
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:31,258
You don't have a key?

1137
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:34,566
No, I have a key.
I just couldn't figure out
how to get it to work.

1138
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:37,830
You can't work a key.

1139
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,528
No, I can. But--

1140
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:43,749
OK, OK, OK. You come over here,
the little victim,

1141
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,707
soliciting help from him,
right?

1142
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,668
No, I just needed to get
into my house.

1143
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:52,801
[sighs] Don't you see
how you sold yourself out?

1144
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:55,892
You are perfectly capable
of opening any door

1145
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:57,806
you have the key to.

1146
01:04:57,937 --> 01:05:00,244
You have to be effective
in your thinking and stop hoping

1147
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:04,552
that some man is going
to come along and rescue you.

1148
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,467
You're right.

1149
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:08,121
Oh, please.

1150
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:09,340
OK.

1151
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:14,214
Then what happened?

1152
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:17,957
Well, then I saw him,
and he look so sad.

1153
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:20,394
Aw. I thought he needed someone
to talk to.

1154
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:23,920
But you weren't talking
when I saw you.

1155
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,444
I was comforting him.

1156
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:30,187
No. No, you can think that,
but that is an illusion.

1157
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:36,149
You were using your sexuality
irresponsibly

1158
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,108
instead of effectively
communicating.

1159
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:40,327
Now, I mean, women do this.
I used to do this.

1160
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,374
It's like you think that
if you give affection to a man,

1161
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:46,464
it might turn up
meaning something about you.

1162
01:05:46,594 --> 01:05:51,034
That you're a worthy person
or a loving person,

1163
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:52,905
but it doesn't.

1164
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:56,691
You end up
sacrificing your self-respect

1165
01:05:56,822 --> 01:06:01,348
for the illusion of intimacy.

1166
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:03,481
I never thought of it like that.

1167
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:06,179
Yeah. Well, start.

1168
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:19,018
And you?

1169
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:21,020
I can't believe it.

1170
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:22,500
I mean
what have we been through?

1171
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,719
What are we working toward?

1172
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,939
Are you finished?

1173
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,594
What?

1174
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:32,727
Are you finished
with your little show?

1175
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,686
-Do you want me to go?
-Yes.

1176
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:35,948
OK.

1177
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:40,692
Can I have your number?

1178
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:43,129
You're really inspiring.

1179
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:46,002
Oh...

1180
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,481
Um...

1181
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:50,832
There. Here you go.

1182
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:53,444
Aw. How cute.

1183
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:54,619
CALEB: Jesus.

1184
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:59,580
[door opens, closes]

1185
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,756
Can't believe what I just saw.

1186
01:07:04,716 --> 01:07:07,849
Fuck, Erica, I don't know.

1187
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,548
I just think
we make better friends.

1188
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:12,332
What's that mean?

1189
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:14,073
I don't know.
You don't feel that?

1190
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:17,033
Are you saying
you're not attracted to me?

1191
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:18,599
Erica.

1192
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,079
Is that what you're saying?

1193
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:24,562
Because if it is,
I want to hear it.

1194
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:26,651
Why are you doing this?

1195
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:30,046
Tell me the truth.

1196
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:35,921
I don't want to hurt you.

1197
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:40,578
What do you think
you're doing, Caleb?

1198
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:45,409
I mean, you're it.

1199
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,367
You're my perfect mate.

1200
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:52,068
You're funny and handsome,
and talented and smart.

1201
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:55,114
You make me feel good.
You get me.

1202
01:07:55,245 --> 01:07:57,247
Baby, we're perfect
for each other.

1203
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:01,164
I don't...

1204
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:04,819
I don't think so.

1205
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:09,607
Why? Why?

1206
01:08:09,737 --> 01:08:12,436
Why? What is it that you need?

1207
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:15,003
I don't know.

1208
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,180
You do. You know
because you're not getting it,

1209
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,877
so you know.

1210
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:23,795
I need to feel special.

1211
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:27,015
-What?
-I need to feel special.

1212
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,930
I don't need
to talk everything out.

1213
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,802
I don't need
to analyze everything

1214
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:34,501
until it makes logical sense.
Some things don't make sense!

1215
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:37,025
They just don't. And that's
what beautiful about them.
They exist.

1216
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:39,811
My feelings exist.

1217
01:08:39,941 --> 01:08:42,553
Instead of making me feel stupid
for having them,

1218
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:43,945
I want someone who's going
to love me because of them,

1219
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:47,601
because I don't make sense.

1220
01:08:47,732 --> 01:08:52,737
You know people might
respect you for your perfection,

1221
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:55,740
but they love you
for your flaws.

1222
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,133
You don't love me for mine.

1223
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:05,489
Because deep down, Erica,

1224
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:08,405
I don't know that they're yours.

1225
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:12,148
You have to listened
to so much enlightened shit,

1226
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,237
that you've been eclipse.

1227
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,195
There'll be moments
when it's just you,

1228
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:20,634
but then you'll spout some
philosophy and you'll go away.

1229
01:09:20,765 --> 01:09:23,463
I don't believe it.

1230
01:09:23,594 --> 01:09:27,380
I don't.
No one has ever taught me
or told me anything

1231
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:30,122
that I didn't already know
everyone has them, Caleb. Fuck.

1232
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,954
We don't learn. We remember.

1233
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:39,653
This is me, Caleb.
I want you with me.

1234
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:41,655
And if you don't want to be
with me,

1235
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,483
have the courage to say
you don't want to be with me.

1236
01:09:43,614 --> 01:09:46,356
Don't make me out
to be some fucking brainwashed

1237
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,140
new aged moonie or something.

1238
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:52,188
God damn it.
Acknowledge that I exist
as a whole, unique person.

1239
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:56,322
OK. OK. You exist
as a whole, unique person.

1240
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:01,240
And I do love you
and respect you--

1241
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,372
You just don't want to fuck me.

1242
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:04,765
It's not that.

1243
01:10:04,896 --> 01:10:07,594
Caleb, tell me the truth.

1244
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:14,906
I just don't want to fuck you.

1245
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,213
[breathing deeply]

1246
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:20,433
Thank you.

1247
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:27,005
Erica, we can be friends.

1248
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:29,877
Yeah, sure.
If I ever stop missing the sex.

1249
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:33,664
So that's it?
You're just going to go?

1250
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:35,840
What do you want me to do?

1251
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,320
I don't know.

1252
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:41,802
Should I stay here
and comfort you?

1253
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:45,328
I don't know. You OK?

1254
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,677
I'm going to go.

1255
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:50,376
No, answer me. Are you OK?

1256
01:10:50,507 --> 01:10:53,118
No, I'm not fucking OK.

1257
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,903
I'm fucking heartbroken.

1258
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:58,471
I mean, Jesus,
what do you think I am,
a machine?

1259
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:04,347
You've broken my heart, Caleb.

1260
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:08,002
I feel stupid, ugly,
and unloved.

1261
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,440
And I just want
to get out of here.

1262
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:12,137
I want to get out of here,

1263
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,575
and get on with whatever it is
I need to get on with.

1264
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:19,666
I don't feel like talking.
I don't feel like listening.

1265
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:22,756
I feel like a piece of my world
is ending, and I just...

1266
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:24,845
I'd very much appreciate it

1267
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:27,935
if you could respect that
and just let me leave. Hmm?

1268
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:29,981
-Erica.
-What?

1269
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:32,810
What are you going to do for me?

1270
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,378
Take me into that room,
make love to me and tell me,

1271
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:37,902
it's all some misunderstanding?

1272
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:40,644
It's all OK.
Make it like it was.

1273
01:11:40,774 --> 01:11:43,168
Are you?

1274
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,301
No.

1275
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:49,696
[sighs]

1276
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:53,352
Yeah, then there's nothing
I can do for you.

1277
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,184
You know what?
Maybe we can be friends.

1278
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,534
But don't ask me that now,

1279
01:12:01,665 --> 01:12:03,841
because then I have to admit
that we don't have the other,

1280
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:06,800
and I'm doing everything
in my power to resist that.

1281
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:10,108
Please.

1282
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,851
Please, Caleb,
if you love me at all,

1283
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:17,115
let me walk out of here.

1284
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:19,639
I feel like shit.

1285
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,686
I want you too.

1286
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:27,952
I really, really want you too.

1287
01:12:28,082 --> 01:12:32,565
But don't say anything,
just let me go.

1288
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:35,699
â™ª

1289
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:21,658
What are you doing?

1290
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:23,573
I'm going to be leaving
for a while.

1291
01:13:23,703 --> 01:13:25,966
Leaving? Where are you going?

1292
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:27,794
Alaska.

1293
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:29,274
What?

1294
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,928
Alaska.

1295
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,887
The light is amazing in Alaska.

1296
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:38,326
I can get some painting done,
clear my head out.

1297
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,807
What are you going to do
for money?

1298
01:13:40,938 --> 01:13:43,331
I got a job
on a commercial fishing boat.

1299
01:13:43,462 --> 01:13:47,335
I was reading some Hemingway
the other night. It just hit me.

1300
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:54,995
So...so you're just going
just like that?

1301
01:13:55,126 --> 01:13:57,345
Well, no.

1302
01:13:58,782 --> 01:13:59,696
We're still friends.

1303
01:13:59,826 --> 01:14:02,438
I just...

1304
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:04,788
I need
to get out of here for a while,

1305
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:08,008
get some new experiences,
sort some things out.

1306
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:12,448
How are you doing?

1307
01:14:17,931 --> 01:14:20,368
You know where I could score
some heroine?

1308
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:25,330
Yeah, what's going on?

1309
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:30,291
I wish I drank.

1310
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:33,469
This would be a perfect time
to get shitfaced.

1311
01:14:34,948 --> 01:14:37,081
What happened?

1312
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,736
What happened?

1313
01:14:39,866 --> 01:14:44,392
Absolutely everything that could
go wrong today did, everything.

1314
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:46,307
I'm through the
looking glass here.

1315
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:50,486
Everything is fucked up,
Gerry fucked, and fucked out.

1316
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:51,965
I bet I got you beat.

1317
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:53,837
What do you mean?

1318
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:55,403
I would bet you that my last
several hours have been

1319
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:59,059
more soul crushingly sucky
than yours.

1320
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,931
Impossible.

1321
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:02,672
Bet?

1322
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,458
What happened to you?

1323
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:13,465
She wouldn't let
me drive her there.

1324
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:17,425
So I go to this place,
with ducks on the wallpaper,

1325
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:21,038
and dark wood and hunter green

1326
01:15:21,168 --> 01:15:23,823
corduroy couches and shit.

1327
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:26,870
I mean the place
looks like a law library.

1328
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,960
Then I figure they're trying
to make the men comfortable,

1329
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:33,311
it is the man who have to wait
in these places.

1330
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:36,270
And then she comes out.

1331
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:40,231
And she's wearing a diaper.

1332
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:43,147
She's wearing a paper diaper,

1333
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:46,542
and she's delirious
on pain killers.

1334
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:49,762
And she's mumbling
about a corn beef sandwich

1335
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:53,766
and a cream soda or something.

1336
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,594
She's just standing there

1337
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:59,685
mumbling like an infant
in a paper diaper.

1338
01:15:59,816 --> 01:16:04,037
Then she turns to me,
suddenly lucid, and says,

1339
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:07,127
"Did you bring the money?"

1340
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:09,477
I say, "Yes."

1341
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:12,698
She says you can pay the lady
at the desk on your way out.

1342
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:15,266
But then it hits me.

1343
01:16:15,396 --> 01:16:19,270
I got nothing to leave.
I don't have a life.

1344
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,753
There is nothing that
really means anything to me.

1345
01:16:23,883 --> 01:16:27,583
The one thing that could've
meant something to me,

1346
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:29,933
has just joined
the Los Angeles sewer system.

1347
01:16:39,464 --> 01:16:41,597
You win.

1348
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,424
You fucking win.

1349
01:16:43,555 --> 01:16:45,601
I fucking win.

1350
01:16:47,037 --> 01:16:48,429
So you're going to Alaska.

1351
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,606
So I'm going to Alaska.

1352
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,260
[sighs]

1353
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,916
â™ª

1354
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:17,850
[sighs]

1355
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:19,547
I had a horrible dream.

1356
01:17:21,462 --> 01:17:23,856
I dreamt that you broke up
with me.

1357
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,426
Go back to sleep.

1358
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:34,258
[crying]

1359
01:17:35,302 --> 01:17:37,261
â™ª

1360
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,322
What's going on?

1361
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:23,889
Tell him.

1362
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,284
Caleb. Hi, I have something
to tell you.

1363
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:28,589
Where are you going?

1364
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,635
-I'm moving.
-Camille.

1365
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,463
Camille,
say it like you mean it.

1366
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:34,726
-I'm moving.
-You just got here.

1367
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:36,946
She needs to be
around female energy.

1368
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:38,730
I need to be
around female energy.

1369
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:41,080
-Really?
-Yeah, she's moving in with me.

1370
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:44,823
Oh, so you're the female energy?
Ah.

1371
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:46,085
It's just you and some cats
at your place.

1372
01:19:46,216 --> 01:19:47,347
Yeah, well, it's a start.

1373
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:49,741
-Aren't they female cats?
-Good point.

1374
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:52,048
Can I talk to you for a minute,
over here?

1375
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:53,789
Sure.

1376
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:04,060
What the fuck are you doing?

1377
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,670
What do you mean?

1378
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,889
She's moving in with you?
You hardly know her.

1379
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:08,151
Well, that didn't stop you.

1380
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:10,109
When did all this happen?

1381
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,155
I gave her my number.
You were there.

1382
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:15,636
She called me a couple of times
with a--with a personal problem.

1383
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:17,334
What kind of personal problem?

1384
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:19,118
Personal problem, one that I'm
sure is unique to her,

1385
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:22,208
but a problem nonetheless.

1386
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:23,775
What?

1387
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:27,561
She didn't...

1388
01:20:27,692 --> 01:20:31,652
She didn't know--she don't know
how to put in a tampon.

1389
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:32,915
You got to be kidding me.

1390
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:34,307
Wh--what do you expect?
She's an artist.

1391
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,657
Besides I've got the house
in Venice,

1392
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:37,789
I could use a break on the rent.
I mean you know how that is.

1393
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,357
-Erica.
-No.

1394
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,576
It's as good a move for me
as it is for her.

1395
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:45,014
I will teach her
some basic life skills.

1396
01:20:45,144 --> 01:20:50,062
And...I won't have to go home
to an empty house.

1397
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:52,586
-It'll get easier.
-You don't know that.

1398
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,112
No.

1399
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:01,291
You don't--
you do not have to say anything.

1400
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,381
[sighs]

1401
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:05,861
-Camille.
-Yeah.

1402
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:07,253
Camille, we're going.

1403
01:21:07,384 --> 01:21:09,081
Did you know these flowers
were edible?

1404
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:10,953
No.

1405
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:14,652
You've been eating my flowers?

1406
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:15,871
[sighs] Oh...

1407
01:21:18,482 --> 01:21:19,744
Right.

1408
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:23,530
â™ª

1409
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,434
[vehicle approaching]

1410
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,960
[engine turns off]

1411
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:13,841
Interesting sign.

1412
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:15,060
It's a little terse
but to the point.

1413
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:19,369
So where are you going to live?

1414
01:22:19,499 --> 01:22:22,502
That's a very good question.

1415
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:26,550
I almost packed this
by accident.

1416
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,465
Rilke.

1417
01:22:28,595 --> 01:22:30,467
I forgot I gave this to you.

1418
01:22:30,597 --> 01:22:33,122
There's no inscription in it.
I thought you might want it.

1419
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:36,342
It's from my grandmother.

1420
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:39,650
I can't remember
her giving me this.

1421
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,347
Well, there was this poem
in here she loved.

1422
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:44,046
She--she marked it.

1423
01:22:44,176 --> 01:22:47,963
"Moving forward.

1424
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:50,269
"The deeps part
of my life pour onward,

1425
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,490
"As if the river shores
were opening out,

1426
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,623
"It seems that things are more
like me now,

1427
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:59,539
"That I can see farther
into paintings.

1428
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:03,152
"I feel closer to
what language can't reach.

1429
01:23:03,282 --> 01:23:07,765
"With my senses, as with birds,

1430
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:10,376
"I climb into the windy heaven
out of the oak.

1431
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:13,597
"And in the ponds
broken off from the sky,

1432
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:18,863
My feeling sinks as
if standing on fishes."

1433
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:26,088
It's beautiful.

1434
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:28,307
Why can't I remember
her giving me this?

1435
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:33,747
Maybe because that's not
important.

1436
01:23:33,878 --> 01:23:37,447
What's important is that you
have it and what you do with it.

1437
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:43,322
Do you think I could make
my living as a sculptor?

1438
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:45,890
I think
that's the wrong question.

1439
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,545
Could you live
without sculpting?

1440
01:23:48,675 --> 01:23:49,894
I have.

1441
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,722
Ah, but was that living?

1442
01:23:51,852 --> 01:23:54,333
I guess it's never that simple.

1443
01:23:54,464 --> 01:23:57,684
It's a start.

1444
01:23:57,815 --> 01:24:01,340
I think being an artist has very
little to do with talent.

1445
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:04,039
I think it's mostly
about intention.

1446
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:09,131
Whether you make a living
at it or not,

1447
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:12,177
that's for the future to decide.

1448
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:14,962
I like that.

1449
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:17,226
Good.

1450
01:24:17,356 --> 01:24:19,315
Now stand up and give me a hug.
I'm going to Alaska.

1451
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:29,847
You take care of yourself.

1452
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:33,894
The universe will do that
for me as long as I let it.

1453
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:36,549
It's a wonderful time
to be alive, Caleb.

1454
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:46,733
â™ª

1455
01:26:06,117 --> 01:26:08,075
Rocket girl, look out!

1456
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:09,425
No, no,
that is just too hysterical.

1457
01:26:09,555 --> 01:26:11,601
Now bring it down, Erica.
Bring it way down.

1458
01:26:13,994 --> 01:26:16,693
â™ª

1459
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,655
Oh, hey, rocket girl, look out.

1460
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:08,962
Oh--that's too casual.
What, I'm fucking Brando?

1461
01:27:11,965 --> 01:27:13,706
Rocket girl!

1462
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:16,492
Rocket girl, no!

1463
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:17,884
Oh, my God.

1464
01:27:18,015 --> 01:27:20,147
â™ª

1465
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:35,380
Rocket! Rocket! Oh, I suck!
Why do I suck all of a sudden?

1466
01:27:35,511 --> 01:27:38,992
People, five minutes
to picture, please!

1467
01:27:40,646 --> 01:27:43,083
Ahh.

1468
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:49,046
God! Ugh!

1469
01:27:49,176 --> 01:27:51,657
Where the hell is my half gingko
half cold press

1470
01:27:51,788 --> 01:27:54,878
primrose rutummy tamer tea?
You people are killing me!

1471
01:27:55,008 --> 01:27:57,750
Does anybody have a 20
on that bitch's rag tonic?

1472
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:00,623
Rocket girl!

1473
01:28:00,753 --> 01:28:03,103
Hey, Jiffy puff,
what are you, background, huh?

1474
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:07,325
It's--it's engine
technician one, technically.

1475
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:09,849
-Hey, that's cool.
-Thanks.

1476
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,199
Holding area is over there.
Bye. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, great.

1477
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,506
[whirring]

1478
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:28,477
Yeah, see? See?
Watch her, learn.

1479
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:32,132
You're the only one that knows
what the fuck she's doing.
Thanks, sweetheart.

1480
01:28:33,656 --> 01:28:35,222
Unh.

1481
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:42,882
â™ª

1482
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:01,074
Beautiful, baby. Find me, baby.
Find me. Find me.

1483
01:29:01,205 --> 01:29:02,598
Are we ready to shoot yet?

1484
01:29:02,728 --> 01:29:03,642
[shutter clicking]

1485
01:29:03,773 --> 01:29:05,601
It's a nonsmoking set.

1486
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:07,516
Fuck off!
Would you just leave me alone?

1487
01:29:07,646 --> 01:29:11,607
God! Dolly back. Please.
Dolly back.

1488
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:13,870
Damn it!

1489
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,742
What the hell is she doing here?

1490
01:29:22,748 --> 01:29:25,664
I am rocket girl.
