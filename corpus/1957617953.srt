(soft tense music)

101
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,145
I need protection everywhere I go.

102
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,283
There's always someone with me,

103
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,319
watching me, guarding me.

104
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,924
I grew up in southwest Philly.

105
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,233
When I was 17, my boyfriend took me to my first drug buy.

106
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,238
He gave me the gun,

107
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,673
said they wouldn't frisk me.

108
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,879

112
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,026
That turned out to be my first homicide.

113
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,629
I remember how I felt then,

114
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,732
hysterical, crying and screaming

115
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,200
as he dragged me out the spot.

116
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,806
I miss that feeling.

117
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,308
I wish I could go back.

118
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,246
Back to when I was soft and innocent.

119
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,587
We came up after that.

120
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,389
But eventually the cops caught him.

121
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,427
He left his fingerprints on the table.

122
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,197
I served one year for the drugs they found

123
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,799
when they served the warrant.

124
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,701
He pleaded guilty to homicide for me.

125
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,637
Said he felt responsible.

126
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,107
I really think he loved me.

127
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,682
He served nine months of a eight sentence in Rockview.

128
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,221
He was killed there a short time after.

129
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,495
When I got out, I went to the house we used

130
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,263
to live in to get our stash.

131
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,736
It was right where we left it.

132
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,474
It wasn't much, but it was enough

133
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,608
to get me on my feet, though.

134
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,579
For one year in prison, I barely talked

135
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,282
but I listened to everything that was said.

136
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,918
Every story that was told.

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,821
By the time I got out,

138
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,223
I was ready for the street.

139
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,825
I knew what I wanted to do

140
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,160
and I knew how to do it.

141
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,331
I did whatever it took to build a nice lay.

142
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,633
I even killed for it.

143
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,669
(gunshot)

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,408
Now, don't get it twisted, I'm far from rich

00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,985

149
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,054

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,839
- [Dion] Something like that.

558
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,474
He pissed of Ninea Ranks.

559
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,344
He was gonna testify against her in court.

560
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,679
So she had him killed.

561
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,850
Stupid motherfucker!

562
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,019
I told him to lay low.

563
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:01,886

564
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,292
Well, you know what this means, don't you?

00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,694
We definitely gonna have to do something about this shit.

566
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,463
So this is what I want you two to do.

567
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,099
I want you to follow her, keep tabs on her.

568
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,066

569
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,168

00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,142
there's your ass.

925
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,581
- All right.

926
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,683
Can I ask you a question?

927
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:41,752
- [T] What?

928
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,288
- Is Ninea gay?

929
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,559
- Why?

930
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,528
You got a problem with gay people?

931
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,498
- I was just wondering because I haven't seen

932
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,432
no men up in here.

933
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,067
Only thing I see was women.

934
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,704
- [T] No, Ninea is not gay.

935
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,508
She doesn't trust men, though.

936
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,944
- Are you gay?

937
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,616
- Why, you interested?

938
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,121
- Uh.

939
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,827
- [T] Well, anyway.

940
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,896
I have a favor to ask you.

941
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,499
I want you to snort a line of some blow right here.

942
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,276
- Nah, that's all right.

943
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,144
I'm cool.

944
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,346
- [T] Oh you cool?

945
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,714
- I'm all right.

946
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,952
(tense music)

947
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,320
(woman gasping)

948
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,655
What you doing?

949
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,823
- When I tell you to do something,

950
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,558
you fucking do it.

951
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,493
I run this fucking shit.

952
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,896
You do what I tell you to do when I say.

953
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,032
Or I will cut you up into fucking pieces

954
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,002
and throw you down the motherfucking sewer.

955
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,271
Now you snort that blow.

956
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,607
You hear me?

957
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,818
Snort the blow!

958
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,162
(woman coughing)

959
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,198
- Oh god.

960
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,170
(bell tolling)

961
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,109
- We don't know why he did it.

962
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,912
All we wanted to do was come in and question him, you know?

963
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,181
The guy said he had to pee.

964
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:56,153
He went to the bathroom and he blew his fucking brains out.

965
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,323
- [Woman] What?

966
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,191
You mean to tell me he blew his brains out

967
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,560
while you two was still in the house?

968
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,329
- Yeah.

969
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,133
- Wow.

970
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,767
Do you know if he ever killed that girl or not?

971
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,071
- We never got a chance to ask him.

972
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,441
Apparently someone tipped us off and led us to him.

973
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:21,211
Obviously, he was doing something that we didn't know about.

974
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,981
We tore the house apart

975
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,516
and we found nothing.

976
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,652
- Guy did something

977
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,954
and he panicked and he blew his head off.

978
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:33,924
- Wow.

979
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,493
This is so fucking bizarre.

980
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,896
I don't think I can live in your world.

981
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,865
You two got preps blowing their brains out

982
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,501
just because they're under suspicion.

983
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,271
- Hey, you should of been there when we told the captain.

984
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,640
I thought his head was gonna fucking explode.

985
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,509
- I gotta go.

986
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,577
By y'all.

987
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:13,530
- Look.

988
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,400
- What?

989
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,267
- Shooting star.

990
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,306
- What?

991
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,173
- Ninea.

992
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,279
- Ranks?

993
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:34,318
- Yeah.

994
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,958
♪ Where were you last night ♪

995
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,761

(siren wailing)

997
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,236
(soft R&B music)

998
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,103
- Oh shit, Ninea.

999
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,740
It's the 5-0.

1000
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,948
- Man go over to that shopping center

1001
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:05,949
and stash the gun.

1002
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,020
(soft R&B music)

1003
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:32,142

- Ninea Ranks.

1008
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,997
- [Ninea] I want my lawyer.

1009
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,265
- What?

1010
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,035
I haven't even asked you a goddamn question yet.

1011
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,403
- [Ninea] I know but you will

1012
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,804
and I want my lawyer.

1013
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,739
- Just relax, Ninea.

1014
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,107
Stop acting like one of the fucking Ramseys

1015
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,342
and get out of the car.

1016
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,586
So, it's been awhile.

1017
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,721
How was your vacation?

1018
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,427
- [Cop] You got identification?

1019
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,661
- Would you like to have another one?

1020
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:26,797
- Hands behind your back.

1021
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,565
- Let's see.

1022
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:33,003
Been three years since I was on the narcotics squad.

1023
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,305
I remember arresting your mother

1024
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,540
with an eight ball.

1025
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,741
- Stay right here.

1026
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,609
- And speaking of law abiding citizens,

1027
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,578
how is your dear old lady?

1028
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:44,181
- She's dead.

1029
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,951
- Damn.

1030
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,687
And she was a fucking contribution

1031
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,389
to your sad ass environment.

1032
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,229
- Look, I got somewhere to be at.

1033
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,832
- Oh I know.

1034
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,033
I know.

1035
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,901
You gotta, you know, keep your little bitches

1036
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:05,769
in check, right?

1037
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,845
Look.

1038
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,913
I play pokers with the boys in Vice.

1039
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,685
You take care of me and I guarantee

1040
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,354
that you won't have to spend another time in jail.

1041
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,396
- [Ninea] What about your partner?

1042
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,432
- He knows the rules.

1043
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,834
He knows how to play the game.

1044
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,638
So, do we have a deal or what?

1045
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,479
- Yeah.

1046
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,016
- That's good.

1047
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,017
Well, you know what.

1048
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,723
I think you need to hibernate for today.

1049
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,792
I'm sick of looking at ya.

1050
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,301
- Bitch.

1051
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,372
(soft tense music)

1052
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,711
- Yo man, why your face all twisted the fuck up?

1053
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,815
Yo, Penn, what the fuck you keep looking over here for

1054
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,151
before I blast your fucking ass.

1055
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,153
What what what what?

1056
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,588
Yeah, go ahead.

1057
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,989
Fucking bitch ass nigga.

1058
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,424
See, that's what I'm talking about, man.

1059
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,493
That's how you gotta do these motherfuckers out here.

1060
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,228
Straight the fuck up.

1061
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,496
You gotta let these motherfuckers know

1062
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,731
at any time, bang, you know what I'm saying?

1063
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,902
Better pay attention to this shit man,

1064
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,604
that's how you do that shit.

1065
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,406
Fuck the motherfuckers.

1066
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,043
- Yo, man, let me ask you a question.

1067
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,815
How come we never seen Ninea and her bitches

1068
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,850
out on the fucking corner clocking bags?

1069
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,520
- I don't know.

1070
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,891
And one thing, them bitches don't be where we be at.

1071
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,961
- But that's just it, yo.

1072
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,963
I be around they motherfucking way.

1073
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,231
They don't be on the fucking corner.

1074
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,101
How the fuck do they be making they money?

1075
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,169
- Keisha.

1076
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,436
What ups, girl?

1077
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,404
Come here, come here for a minute.

1078
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,672
Let me rap at you for a minute.

1079
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,874
I'm saying, what I can't get a fucking minute?

1080
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,143
Go away, go away.

1081
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,679
Fucking chicken head, man.

1082
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,582
Yo man, she must be selling weight, though.

1083
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:06,883
Yo, wouldn't it be funny

1084
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,852
if Dion bought his stash through Ninea

1085
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,186
from two different people?

1086
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,323
That shit would be fucked up.

1087
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,531
- You know that would be funny.

1088
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,767
That means Dion basically working for Ninea.

1089
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,269
(laughing)

1090
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:27,637
- Like Lawrence.

1091
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,540
- Speaking of Dion, our boss,

1092
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,008
fucking boss.

1093
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,211
How the fuck did he get to be our boss, yo?

1094
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,615
- Man stop asking stupid ass fucking questions.

1095
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,550
That motherfucker got the coke,

1096
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,953
he got the money, and he got the fucking power.

1097
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,858
- Nigga, I'ma put it to you like this.

1098
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,461
The money we could take.

1099
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,395
- Right.

1100
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,363
- The coke we could purchase

1101
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,231
and the power,

1102
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,668
nigga the power, that remains to be seen

1103
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,036
who the fuck got the power.

1104
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,439
Let's keep it real, aight?

1105
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,974

00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,875

1107
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,811
- Nah.

1108
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,681
I'm being straight up, nah.

1109
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,149
- Okay, keep it real.

1110
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,784
Have you ever seen that motherfucker throw a punch?

1111
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,088
- See, he don't have to do that shit

1112
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,956
because that's why we here.

1113
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,391
You know what I'm saying?

1114
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,292
We the muscle in this bitch.

1115
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,195
- Oh like the mob, right?

1116
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,963
Like Dion fucking mob connections.

1117
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,065
- So what you saying?

1118
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,302
- What I'm saying.

1119
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,803
What I'm saying, what I'm saying, what I'm saying.

1120
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,106
Nigga, what I'm saying is Dion's a fucking bitch.

1121
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:36,973
I'm saying.

1122
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,644
We already know Ninea done killed one person already

1123
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,179
and who the fuck knows who else she tapped the fuck out.

1124
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,714
We saw this bitch in the fucking store,

1125
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,149
I'ma tell you like this,

1126
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,751
that bitch is fucking 'bout it.

1127
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,554
She ready to go, she making power moves and shit.

1128
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,857
We still doing this penny ante bullshit.

1129
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,260
Dean, fuck Dion. - You know what though?

1130
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,461
You know what though,

1131
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,796
Dion told me about that situation

1132
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,598
at the grocery store, right?

1133
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,299
But he aint fucking tell it to me like that.

1134
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,634
He made it seem like he handled that shit

1135
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,735
like a fucking man.

1136
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,938
And you telling me this, he bitched the fuck out.

1137
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,307
What the fuck, what the fuck is up with that shit?

1138
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,174
- Nigga.

1139
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,276
- I'm saying, so now what?

1140
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,844
- Nigga, if he handle his shit,

1141
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,946
Ninea and everybody in that motherfucking store

1142
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,548
would be dead right now

1143
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,216
and we wouldn't be going through this shit.

1144
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,317
If he handled his shit.

1145
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,552
He got mob connections.

1146
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,586
He aint supposed to be scared of shit.

1147
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,588
He a fucking bitch.

1148
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:26,923
- So-- - You ask me now what?

1149
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:27,791
- So now what?

1150
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,193
- I'ma tell you like this.

1151
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,461
- What now, nigga?

1152
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,862
- I'm ready to cap this motherfucker.

1153
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,997
I'm ready to pull his motherfucking chain

1154
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,465
and see what the fuck fall out.

1155
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,800
Fuck Dion.

1156
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,301
Tired of this shit!

1157
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,103
- Man, here the fuck you go with

1158
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,638

1159
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,408
Man, I, you aint take your fucking medicine, did you?

1160
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,477
I can't believe your fucking ass, man.

1161
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,512
What the fuck is wrong with you, nigga?

1162
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,348
You know, it would take a stupid nigga like you

1163
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,450
to say some shit like that

1164
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:54,918
come out your fucking mouth.

1165
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,220
Man what the.

1166
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,722
Little fucking Timmy aint here now

1167
00:55:58,755 --> 00:55:59,989
'cause he tried to pull a fucking stunt like that

1168
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,158
and they gutted him like a fucking fish.

1169
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,861
Man fuck you, nigga.

1170
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,963
You bump your fucking head?

1171
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:07,964
You must have.

1172
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,502
- I'm calm now.

1173
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,171
I'm calm, I'm cool.

1174
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,139
But, nigga.

1175
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,410
If Dion aint got no mob connections,

1176
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,645
we aint got nothing to worry about, baby.

1177
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,513
Right?

1178
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,416
- All right, okay, now what if he do?

1179
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,485
What if he got some fucking mob connections?

1180
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,687
You want them fucking mob Corleone motherfuckers

1181
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,921
running around chasing you?

1182
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,090
Man, look, let me tell you something, man.

1183
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:34,924
Running from the cops is one thing.

1184
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,126
I can handle that shit.

1185
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,429
But fucking, yo, man I'm human, man.

1186
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,098
My shit aint constructed out of fucking Teflon.

1187
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,500
Man them motherfuckers will find you

1188

00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,069
They will hunt you the fuck down.

1190
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,003
That's what the fuck they do.

1191
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,505
Understand what I'm saying.

1192
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,508
Look, man, don't get it twisted man.

You know you my road dog and we gonna do whatever.

00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,148
But if you fucking wrong, though,

01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:21,504
of drama happening in my life.

1463
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,773
Just being around me is bad for your health.

1464
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:30,479
- Aight.

1465
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:32,148
Whatever.

1466
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,921
- Ninea, everything all right?

1467
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,756
- Well if it wasn't, you'd be a little late right now,

1468
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,624
wouldn't you?

1469
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,627
- I was up all night with that Jimmy thing.

1470
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,564
(phone ringing)

1471
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,103
- Hello.

1472
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:55,938
- [Razor] Hey.

1473
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,506
- Who's this?

1474
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,340
- [Razor] Razor.

1475
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,143
- How the fuck you get my number?

1476
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:03,846
- Look, don't worry about how I got your fucking number.

1477
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,348
Look, that beef you had with Dion,

1478
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:09,084
that shit don't exist no more, I took care of that.

1479
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,019
- And what?

1480
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:10,920
You called me just to brag.

1481
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,521
- Look, bitch.

1482
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:16,492
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I don't mean to disrespect you.

1483
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,894
But look, now that Dion no longer in the picture,

1484
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,796
I'm saying we squash this beef and come together

1485
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,131
and work together, you know what I'm saying?

1486
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:23,632
Lock this city down.

1487
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,967
So what's up?

1488
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,302
- Oh, I get it.

1489
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,737
If I'm not with you I'm against you, right?

1490
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,605
- Yeah.

1491
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:32,408
Hello?

1492
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,210
Hello?

1493
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,645
Ninea?

1494
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,514
- You used to like talking to me back in the day.

1495
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,088
It's not your fault.

1496
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,326
It was his time, Ninea.

1497
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,399
- Fucking bitch.

1498
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,235
That fucking bitch hung up on me.

1499
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:00,970
- What happened, bro.

1500
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:01,637
What happened, what happened?

1501
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,972
She call you?

1502
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:04,073
What she say?

1503
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:05,808
What she say?

1504
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,144
- That bitch hung up the phone.

1505
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,012
I don't believe that shit.

1506
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,950
It's time to send this bitch a fucking message, man.

1507
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:15,818
- What the fuck she say?

1508
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:22,725
- Fuck.

1509
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,093
- Man, you aight?

1510
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,961
What the fuck she say?

1511
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,399
- [Razor] Come on man, let's go.

1512
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,002
(door creaking)

1513
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,538
(tense music)

1514
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:42,845
- Look.

1515
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,313
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1516
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,217
- My girls fellas don't need no man power.

1517
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,519
I really don't want you here

1518
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,389
but Razor got 'em all nervous and what not.

1519
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,292
So you have to prove yourself to me.

1520
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,594
- Really?

1521
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,798
- You ready to get a little blood on your hands?

1522
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,466
- Whatever.

1523
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,968
- Come on.

1524
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,504
(tense music)

1525
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,756
You see this little hussy right here?

1526
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,958
- Yeah.

1527
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,226
- She stole $200 worth of my product.

1528
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,494
- Word?

1529
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,729
- And she's been down here two days.

1530
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,864
Till I find out what I'm gonna do with her.

1531
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,400
She only 14.

1532
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,504
And her mommy left her with her step daddy

1533
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,641
and he likes to play daddy.

1534
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,078
So brother, you'd be doing her a favor.

1535
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,283
Ah, look at her.

1536
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,286
She's so scared.

1537
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,021
Heart beating like thunder.

1538
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,494
(tense music)

1539
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,428
Fully loaded.

1540
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:20,809
Kill her.

1541
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,683
- What about the noise?

1542
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:28,884
- Don't worry about the noise,

1543
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,452
you just point and shoot when I tell you to.

1544
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,956
(tense music)

1545
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:57,646
Shoot.

1546
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,683
(gun clicking empty)

1547
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,821
- What's up with the gun?

1548
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,089
- No firing pin.

1549
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,225
- How am I supposed to bust a cap

1550
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,093
without a firing pin?

1551
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,261
- You don't.

1552
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,797
Look, if you...

1553
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,767
My girls are off limit to you, okay?

1554
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,705
Call me tomorrow.

1555
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:23,572
On Saturday.

1556
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,283
- What's up with your girl?

1557
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:36,452
- She pissed off.

1558
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,020
We had a $200 bet.

1559
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,923
She bet that you wouldn't do it.

1560
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,030
- You were gonna shoot me, weren't you?

1561
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,466
- Business.

1562
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:57,639
Sure is a feisty one, aint she.

1563
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,817
(tense music)

1564
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,022
(gunshot)

1565
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,490
- Come on, you want some more?

1566
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,726
(gunshot)

1567
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,996
(tense dramatic music)

1568
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:45,247
(somber music)

1569
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,654
(somber music)

1570
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,956
- [T Voiceover] I take care of the girls here.

1571
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:03,592
(somber music)

1572
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,073
I got you something.

1573
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,480
(echoing indistinct voiceovers)

1574
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,783
(gunshots)

1575
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,387
(somber music)

1576
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:52,174
- So what you wanna do?

1577
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,442
- I'm gonna kill that motherfucker,

1578
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,644
that's what I'm gonna do.

1579
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,245
- I don't think you should do that.

1580
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,413
I think you should wait things out.

1581
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,382
- Look, I don't,

1582
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,583
I don't pay you to think.

1583
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:04,353
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

1584
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,153
- Hold on, hold on.

1585
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,021
Catch the next elevator.

1586
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:06,888
Back up, man.

1587
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,762
Come on, Ninea.

1588
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:14,596
Let's think things out.

1589
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:15,430
- I'm gonna kill him.

1590
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,598
I done thought about it.

1591
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,466
What is there, what?

1592
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,700
- What, then what?

1593
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:19,668
Kill one of theirs, they kill one of ours

1594
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:20,869
and then what?

1595
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:22,270
Just keep going back and forth?

1596
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,238
- Then everybody's got to die, okay?

1597
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,773
- Oh now everybody's got to die?

1598
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:25,707
- Everybody gotta die.

1599
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:26,508
Whoever don't want to die

1600
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,976
just don't be there.

1601
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,177
- Listen, I don't want to tell you how to run your shit,

1602
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:31,246
Ninea, but, it aint gonna work out that way.

1603
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,849
(somber music)

1604
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:49,731
- [Man Voiceover] You know when I got back

1605
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,700
from the hospital,

1606
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:55,971
you know how I sound when those fuckers tore me up.

1607
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,106
You know what I did to those guys?

1608
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,411
(somber music)

1609
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,921
So you got no choice.

1610
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,892
You got to take care of Holly.

1611
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,329
If you don't.

1612
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,366
You know how you gonna wind up.

1613
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,203
(somber music)

1614
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,274
You're looking at it.

1615
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:46,621
- Get your coat.

1616
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,925
We gonna take care of this shit tonight.

01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,044
Snake ass motherfuckers.

01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:46,882
You know you gonna pay for what you did to my sister.

1637

You think I give a fuck about him?

1642
