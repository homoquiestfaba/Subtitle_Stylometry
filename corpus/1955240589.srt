1
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,329
Cassie?

2
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,569
What did I say about
needing more alone time?

3
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,906
You need it
right now?

4
00:01:13,972 --> 00:01:16,075
Please don't argue.

5
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,813
Well, you could give me
some notice.

6
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,067
Where's Cassie?

7
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:26,519
She's upstairs.

8
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,486
Is she coming down?

9
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:30,256
Not tonight. No.

10
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,593
Cheers.

11
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,368
What?

12
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,674
You know that girl?

13
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,644
I don't think so.

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,263
The Massachusetts state
driver's manual?

15
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,266
I have my road test
next week.

16
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:50,401
And it's making you cry?

17
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:52,405
No.

18
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:00,478
Sweetie, you're really
freaking me out lately.

19
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:01,881
I know.

20
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:08,319
I'm sorry that I'm so...

21
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,322
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:23,969
I'm gonna take out
the trash, okay?

23
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,383
-Can I help you?
-Hi.

24
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,786
Hi.

25
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,490
Do you know...
You know who I am?

26
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,491
No.

27
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,493
No idea at all?

28
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:52,730
Should I?
Sorry.

29
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,033
It's kinda weird.
I-I'm not a crazy person.

30
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,435
I'm...

31
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,770
Okay.

32
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,608
Who are you?

33
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,810
-Can I have a hug first?
-What?

34
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,747
I'm sorry. I'm really
exhausted and nervous,

35
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,918
and I... I really...
I need a hug.

36
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,589
Thank you.

37
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:19,992
Thank you.

38
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,031
So?

39
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:29,634
You're Davis Green.

40
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:32,805
And I'm Alexis Green.

41
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,841
And we're cousins.

42
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,778
No, you have
the wrong person.

43
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,314
No.

44
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,651
No, your dad is Ronald Green. He's
a developmental psychologist.

45
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,519
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

46
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:50,488
And he doesn't have
any siblings.

47
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:54,959
No, no. No, he does. He has
an older brother, my dad.

48
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:58,964
And they just never,
like...

49
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,736
You forgot the trash.

50
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,972
Cassie, thi...

51
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,413
Okay.

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,749
I'm not who you're looking for.

53
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,117
My dad doesn't have any siblings,
and I don't have any cousins,

54
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,954
and we have the last name,
but it's pretty common, so...

55
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,591
No, no.

56
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,461
Please... Please leave.

57
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,906
It was really nice
to meet you, Davis.

58
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,812
Fuck!

59
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,878
I have to tell you something.

60
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,651
<b>THE AUTOMATIC HATE</b>

61
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,652
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

62
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,660
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. You're very kind.

63
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:11,863
I'm glad the applause sign
is still working.

64
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,800
This is HD 115.

65
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,237
Human Development.

66
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,872
If you're looking for
"Heavy Drinking 115,"

67
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,774
it's across the quad,
down the block to Mulligan's.

68
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,779
Human development.

69
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:34,019
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a baby.

70
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,855
One of the great
mysteries of life.

71
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:41,159
Who is she?
What will she become?

72
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,028
Will you be a painter?

73
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,564
A head of state?

74
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,299
A murderer?

75
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,203
By the way you're looking at me
right now, I'm guessing the last.

76
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,938
Thank you.

77
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:58,009
And is it inevitable...

78
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,177
What she will become?

79
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,848
Is it predetermined?

80
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:09,054
Or is someone, something out there
going to be transformative?

81
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,722
Nature, nurture?

82
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,660
That is the question.

83
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,097
This class will bring us
to a closer understanding...

84
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:22,867
that the question
is bullshit.

85
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,639
The answer is
far more complex, subtle...

86
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:31,009
than any black or white
conclusion.

87
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:34,346
It is much more... gray.

88
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,150
I want to thank Jane,
my PhD student...

89
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:43,588
Thank you... who gave birth specifically
for the purpose of this class.

90
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,861
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a spy among us.

91
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:56,334
Sitting in the back, that bearded
gentleman, is my son, Davis.

92
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,704
What has he become?

93
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,077
You're still dating
the, ballerina?

94
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,112
Cassie, yes.

95
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,181
For almost two years now.

96
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,618
It's been that long?

97
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,852
Well, that doesn't mean that
you still can't take out...

98
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,221
one of my beautiful,
brilliant PhD students...

99
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,857
on an innocent little
museum date, does it?

100
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,927
That's exactly what it means, Dad.
Cassie moved in.

101
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,797
Right, right.

102
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,667
See, I always thought she was one of those
fun things, you know, like a placeholder.

103
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,335
Why'd you think that?

104
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,304
Well, she's
a little bit impulsive.

105
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,338
Emotional,
out of control.

106
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,408
Yeah. So?

107
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,677
Your mom will be ecstatic
to see you.

108
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,113
Hi.

109
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,815
Hi, Mom.

110
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,819
<i>...that he is good
at creating jobs...</i>

111
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,159
This can't be right.

112
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:57,929
Four-letter word
for a World War II city.

113
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,333
Rouen.

114
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,769
It's St. Lo.

115
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,270
You have to
abbreviate it.

116
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:08,873
S-T-L-O.

117
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,744
I hate when they don't tell you
that they are abbreviating.

118
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,346
You just opened up
that whole corner though.

119
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,283
And the riddle.

120
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,057
I was thinking about cooking
for all of us. Anything you want?

121
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:30,329
You're gonna do
your cooking thing?

122
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,732
Okay.

123
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,134
I ate already.

124
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:42,307
But yeah, you should...
go do that.

125
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,894
Hi.

126
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,246
How's he doing today?

127
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,430
He's fine.

128
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,399
Lots of napping.

129
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,936
Could you give us
a second?

130
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,021
Yeah.

131
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,038
Thank you.

132
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,859
I'm sorry, Davis.

133
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,296
Can I talk to you
about something?

134
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,177
Y... You know, your mother
painted this, Ronnie.

135
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:00,812
You mean Grandma
painted it.

136
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,581
Right, Grandpa?

137
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,150
I'm not Ronnie.
I'm Davis.

138
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,554
Yeah.

139
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,259
Is that my dad?

140
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,562
Yep.

141
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,535
And who's that?

142
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,136
That's Joshua.

143
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,905
What?

144
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,075
Why, that's Joshua.

145
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,478
Who's Joshua?

146
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,084
We do not talk about Joshua.

147
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,053
Why not?
Who is he?

148
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,557
No, no, no, no.

149
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,898
Easy. Okay.

150
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,466
-Okay, okay.
-Ronnie!

151
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,902
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

152
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,403
Ronnie. Ronnie!

153
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,138
-Okay, easy. It's okay.
-Ronnie!

154
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,307
No, no, no, no.

155
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,341
-Ronnie!
-Excuse me!

156
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,511
-Can we get some help here, please?
-No, no, no, no, no!

157
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,322
Everything's gonna be okay.

158
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,025
I want you to look at me.
Right here.

159
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:23,127
<i>...a fixed term next year.</i>

160
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,298
<i>Interest groups spent more
than nine million dollars...</i>

161
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,668
<i>to influence the outcome of this
year's statewide ballot questions,</i>

162
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,620
<i>and the heavy offenders...</i>

163
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,504
Who is he?

164
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,539
<i>According to a new report
from the state office...</i>

165
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,574
<i>of campaign
and political finances.</i>

166
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,312
<i>WDUR's Shannon Mullen reports.</i>

167
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,614
<i>The report shows
the biggest spending...</i>

168
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,502
Davis, Davis, Davis, Davis!
Where are you going?

169
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,203
-To check on Grandpa.
-Why?

170
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,174
What's wrong? Is there another relative
you're afraid he'll tell me about?

171
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,676
Davis, wait a second.
What did you say to him?

172
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:15,447
All I did was ask him to explain
the painting. Do you want to?

173
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,052
You have a brother?

174
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,422
No, I don't.

175
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,091
Not anymore.

176
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,325
What happened?

177
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,663
<i>I can't even begin
to explain it,</i>

178
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,500
<i>nor is it any
of your goddamn business.</i>

179
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,574
<i>There's a reason
this has been kept from you.</i>

180
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,442
<i>Leave it alone!</i>

181
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,950
<i>You don't know what you're about to do.
Trust me.</i>

182
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,103
Hey.

183
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,404
You know what time
they open?

184
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,641
In about an hour.

185
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,058
You work here?

186
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,409
Nah, man.

187
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:54,478
Just waiting for my refill.

188
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,181
You too?

189
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,749
Yeah.

190
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,718
Wait, what?

191
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,657
Check it out.

192
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,128
What?

193
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,664
I thought this was
a thrift shop.

194
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:17,201
It is, man, but they've got
a dispensary inside.

195
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,707
You know, they grow it
and sell it on their farm.

196
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:27,178
If you don't tell them where you got
the address, I'll give it to you.

197
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:33,183
I'll take that address.

198
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,654
<i>Hi. This is Cassie.
Leave a message.</i>

199
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,625
Hey, Cass, it's me.

200
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,429
I have almost no service here,
so I hope you get this.

201
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,499
I'm in a tiny town
called Dustin, New York,

202
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,435
driving
to my uncle's farm.

203
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:55,673
That girl who came
to visit me, Alexis...

204
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,709
She wasn't lying.

205
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,512
She's my fucking cousin.

206
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,647
My dad has a brother
who I guess...

207
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,616
Fuck!

208
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,309
Today I caught
a girl shoplifting.

209
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,345
Okay. And did you
call the cops?

210
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,948
No, I let her keep it.
It was so cute on her.

211
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,450
What? You can't just
give our clothes away.

212
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,786
It was like... It would've been two
dollars, She couldn't afford it.

213
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,857
You know we're open, right?
You can come in.

214
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:24,461
Yeah. I'm just...
I'm just lookin'.

215
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,864
Thank you.

216
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,145
Who was that?

217
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,713
He was just looking
at dresses.

218
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,656
Hey, guys!

219
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,306
Hello.

220
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,575
Hey, Alexis.

221
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,777
<i>Yeah?</i>

222
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,379
It's Davis.

223
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,951
Hi.
What do you want?

224
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,388
Can you talk?

225
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,659
Sure.

226
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,706
Hey!

227
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,741
Hey.

228
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,853
Why... Why did we have to
meet all the way out here?

229
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,422
'Cause it's fun.

230
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:34,826
And my parents are home. I wanted to
make sure they didn't see me leave.

231
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:46,069
Come on. I've got a
surprise for you.

232
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:48,905
-You sure my car's okay back there?
-Yeah.

233
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,457
You wanna tell me
where we're goin'?

234
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,942
Nope.

235
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,711
A hint maybe?

236
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:56,548
There's some people
you need to meet.

237
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:04,322
Ladies, come on out.

238
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:11,763
Davis Green, this is Amanda
Green and this is Annie Green.

239
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,500
He looks
a little like Dad.

240
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,801
No, he doesn't.

241
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,035
Not now.
When he was younger.

242
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:22,573
Maybe in his hairline.

243
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,609
Getting in?

244
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,148
What? Are you mad I didn't
tell you about them before?

245
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:31,750
No.

246
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,453
This is fuckin' awesome.

247
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:43,394
You like it?

248
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,642
So, you have
any brothers or sisters?

249
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:00,778
That's too bad.

250
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:07,052
Beer.

251
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,655
So, do you guys have any
idea what happened?

252
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:12,906
You mean with our dads?

253
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,090
Yeah.

254
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,793
Alexis tried to
bring it up once, but...

255
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,830
-Yeah, that didn't go too well.
-We got threatened.

256
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:20,464
So we dropped it.

257
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:25,769
Dad said that if we tried to make
contact with you or your dad, then...

258
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:28,706
-Then what?
-Bad things.

259
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:36,681
Wait. You were at the store
today, weren't you?

260
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,049
-Yeah.
-Were you spying on us?

261
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,519
No! No.
Not... Not really.

262
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,820
Alexis stalked me
all over Boston.

263
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:46,590
Unemployed students have
time to do stuff like that.

264
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,825
Fuck off, Amanda.

265
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,096
So, do you have
a girlfriend?

266
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:55,433
Any of you
have boyfriends?

267
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,672
So, what's she do?

268
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,808
She's a dancer at the
Charles Ballet of Boston.

269
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,743
She seems really nice.
She's pretty.

270
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,446
Wait, you met her?

271
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,849
Kinda.

272
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:14,519
So, how did you find me?

273
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,988
Well, I...

274
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,757
I saw your dad in one
of my psych textbooks,

275
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:21,692
and then,
I googled him,

276
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,096
and I saw that you went
to Yale, and then I...

277
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:29,267
Well, I found your
restaurant online, and so...

278
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,836
She's a stalker.

279
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,805
Look at that.

280
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,309
So you went to Yale?

281
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,310
Yeah, for psychology.

282
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:41,812
So what do you do now?

283
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,246
I'm a chef.

284
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:46,050
So mostly, I just
disappoint my parents.

285
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:49,720
Yeah, they're not too happy
about that decision.

286
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:50,838
Are you a sous chef?

287
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,889
I'm a head chef.

288
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:54,125
That must be
a powerful position.

289
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,560
In the kitchen.
Not in life, really.

290
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,896
God, Alexis,
we're in public.

291
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:03,834
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

292
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:08,105
It's just that I find it...
It's really sad, you know?

293
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,973
What is?

294
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,143
That we didn't
grow up together.

295
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,346
Alexis, you haven't had
that much to drink...

296
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,280
-Yes, she has.
-Maybe she should stop.

297
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:19,916
I'm not drunk, okay?

298
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:22,086
We apologize.
She is drunk.

299
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,689
It's okay.

300
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,759
Shit.

301
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:35,832
My gosh.
Look who it is.

302
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,269
-Who's he?
-Annie used to fuck him.

303
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,205
You used to fuck that guy?

304
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:43,940
Off and on.

305
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,777
I thought we were dating,
but then...

306
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,015
On the Fourth of July, I
accidentally went down on him.

307
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,951
Accidentally?

308
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,188
How do you accidentally...

309
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,757
No. Never mind. That's
happened to me too.

310
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,859
I am still pissed at you, Alexis.
I really liked him.

311
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:04,729
I didn't even know
you guys were...

312
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,999
And-And you are
way better off anyway.

313
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:13,704
It is a small town, which increases the
odds of something like that occurring.

314
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:22,213
-What?
-What?

315
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,682
I fucked him too.
Just once, okay?

316
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:27,951
You knew about this?

317
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,253
That's a lot
of coincidences.

318
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,855
I...

319
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,825
No, Amanda,
give me your purse.

320
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,728
-Why?
-Just give her your purse.

321
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:40,430
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm really sorry.

322
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,067
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I love you.

323
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,001
Where the fuck
are you going?

324
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:46,936
She has a knife.

325
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:48,339
Come on.

326
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,442
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hey.

327
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:53,778
How are you?

328
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,046
What do you want,
Alexis?

329
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,181
You're looking so good.

330
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,248
Fuck off.

331
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,217
Honey,
you got something...

332
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,752
What the...

333
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:04,623
-What the fuck!
-Easy.

334
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:06,891
Fucking whore!

335
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:12,296
My... Go, go, go, fast! Go fast!

336
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,335
Come here!

337
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,104
What the hell was that?

338
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,338
That was amazing
is what it was!

339
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,841
-Have you ever punched anyone before?
-No!

340
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,427
Why, did it look
like I had?

341
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:27,945
No!

342
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:29,846
This is for you.

343
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:32,348
Let's get the fuck out of here!

344
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,333
Now, be super fucking quiet
because Mom sleeps light.

345
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,835
Wait, where are they?

346
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,838
Don't worry. This is our space.
They never come down here.

347
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,976
Do you not wanna stay?

348
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,477
I just don't wanna
meet them yet.

349
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:37,914
Well, you know, we could set you an
alarm and get you out of here early.

350
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,450
Yeah.

351
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,985
-Good night.
-Yeah.

352
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,054
Good night.

353
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:46,725
-Good night.
-Good night.

354
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,062
You can take my bed.

355
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:56,032
-I'll just...
-That's where you sleep?

356
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,501
Yeah.!

357
00:28:58,568 --> 00:28:59,837
Where will you go?

358
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,105
On the floor.

359
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,339
No. No, I'll stay on...

360
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:04,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

361
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,510
Thank you.

362
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,352
As you can see,

363
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,421
it's kinda hard to
bring guys back here.

364
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:19,590
Because of your parents?

365
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:23,127
No, they don't care. It's just
a small space for three girls.

366
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,229
Why not move out?

367
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,901
Don't let the farm fool you.
We're pretty broke.

368
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,304
So you date a lot?

369
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,005
No.

370
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:37,473
I mean, I try.

371
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,410
I just... I have shitty luck.

372
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,282
I pick
all the wrong ones.

373
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:51,454
Like that guy in the bar?

374
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:55,859
That's not shitty luck.
That's shitty taste.

375
00:29:55,926 --> 00:30:00,263
Yeah, well, there aren't
many options up here.

376
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,001
Well, from now on, every guy you
date has to be approved by me.

377
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:07,070
That's sweet.

378
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:12,876
Hey, Davis?

379
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,817
I decided
I like you now.

380
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,221
I like you too.

381
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,160
That can't be comfortable.

382
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,364
It's not really.

383
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,209
Mom.

384
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:56,080
Th...
This is...

385
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:57,748
John.

386
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,317
Well, breakfast will
be ready shortly, John.

387
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:04,320
Thank you,
but I...

388
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,522
We have
only one rule here.

389
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,725
If you can't bring a guy
to the table,

390
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:11,661
you probably shouldn't
be sleeping with him.

391
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,663
That's not a rule.

392
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,032
Well, it should be.

393
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,333
And we're not...

394
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,703
Right.
I'll see you upstairs.

395
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,545
So much for your sisters
waking us up early.

396
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:30,447
Yeah, I bet
they overslept too.

397
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,382
How are we
gonna do this?

398
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,418
Well, my mom
didn't recognize you.

399
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,652
What about your dad?

400
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,089
Let's just say
you're my boyfriend.

401
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:01,711
Dad, this is Jonathan.
We're dating.

402
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,750
Hi, Jonathan.

403
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,752
What happened
to the last guy?

404
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:10,488
Dad shot him.

405
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:15,158
You're not a vegetarian,
are you?

406
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,128
-No.
-Good. Keep cutting.

407
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:21,298
So, Jonathan,
how did you two meet?

408
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,299
He was my TA.

409
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:25,601
Yeah? For what class?

410
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,672
Developmental Psych.

411
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,777
You want some eggs?

412
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,211
Sure.

413
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,246
I'm sorry.
We're out of bacon.

414
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:39,116
Amanda, go kill another pig
after breakfast.

415
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:42,486
-I can't do it today. Make Alexis do it.
-Gross.

416
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,689
I have to work two jobs and now this?
Yeah, that's fair.

417
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,557
I'm not doing it.
Annie, you do it.

418
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,859
-I have to open the store.
-Fine.

419
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:52,663
Jonathan and I
will do it.

420
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,565
I'm sorry?

421
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm stuck out here in the
woods with four women.

422
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,302
First time a guy's
been around in a while.

423
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:02,138
I don't know
how much help I would be.

424
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:04,307
Well, you're fucking
my daughter.

425
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,344
The least you can do is keep me
some company while I kill a pig.

426
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:09,863
Joshua.

427
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:11,314
Dad!

428
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,264
Are the pigs
back there?

429
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:32,869
No. Pigs stink like shit. We
don't keep them near the house.

430
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,471
Get in.

431
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,221
Just so you know, sir,

432
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:54,657
I would never even think about
sleeping with your daughter.

433
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,626
Now, that sounds
like an insult.

434
00:34:56,693 --> 00:35:01,164
No. I mean, I would.

435
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,134
I'm just not.

436
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,197
What does that do?

437
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,534
Kills the pig on contact. This
way you don't have to bleed it.

438
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,537
Very little suffering.
Very humane.

439
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,439
What now? We just go
in there and zap one?

440
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:46,911
I'll tell you what now.
Stop fucking with me!

441
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,550
Yes, sir.

442
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:56,385
He send you here
to spy on me?

443
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:57,870
Who?

444
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:59,288
Don't insult
my intelligence, man.

445
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:01,658
I know you're
my brother's son.

446
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:08,431
Actually, your daughters
said I look a bit like you...

447
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:10,500
when you were younger.

448
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,673
I don't see it.

449
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,367
So did you go to college?

450
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:47,637
Yeah. Why do you ask?

451
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:49,773
Just curious...

452
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,309
if maybe you'd also
studied psychology.

453
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,278
I studied philosophy.

454
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:56,997
Did you go to Yale too?

455
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:58,382
No way.

456
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,585
Fuck that place.

457
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,554
I went to Harvard.

458
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,510
Sorry I didn't get
to see you grow up.

459
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:29,447
It's all right.

460
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,416
So, what now?

461
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,920
Nothing.
Have a good life.

462
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,856
That's it?

463
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:41,307
You don't want to see him?

464
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:42,692
Nope.

465
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,562
-Why not?
-Plenty of reasons.

466
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:47,113
Give me one.

467
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:48,597
Because he doesn't
want to see me.

468
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:51,869
You guys are brothers. What
could have possibly happened?

469
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:58,974
Why the fuck do you think
I'd tell you that?

470
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:03,447
What we have between us,
it's unresolvable.

471
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,882
If I knew what happened,
would I hate you?

472
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,985
It was nice
to meet you, Davis.

473
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,501
Wh... Where are you going?

474
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,836
I need you to drive me
back to my car.

475
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:29,873
Why?

476
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,907
He knew who I was, Alexis,

477
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:34,010
as soon as he saw me.

478
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,914
Okay. So here's what we'll do.
We'II...

479
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,718
No, I need you to
drive me back to my car.

480
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,721
No.

481
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:47,423
Then I'll walk.

482
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,492
You're just... What?

483
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,598
Davis.

484
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,900
Davis.
Davis, wait, please.

485
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,135
Your dad
asked me to leave.

486
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:01,137
So what? I have to do
this all by myself?

487
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:02,938
Do what?

488
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:05,574
Find a way to get our
families back together.

489
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,042
That's what you want to do?

490
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,845
Unless I'm
imagining things,

491
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:11,080
it seems like you were
enjoying your break up here.

492
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,617
Wait. What?

493
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,987
From your girlfriend.

494
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,655
Break?

495
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,957
I... I-I didn't mean it
like that.

496
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:24,860
I just mean you were
having a good time,

497
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:28,932
and I picked up on a vibe that
you guys are having problems.

498
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,135
Sorry to pry.

499
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,372
She had an abortion, Alexis.

500
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,608
My gosh.

501
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,583
Yeah, so that brought up
a lot of shit between us.

502
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:51,821
Davis, I'm so sorry.

503
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,024
Yeah, thanks.

504
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,597
So, what if I stayed?

505
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,568
What's your plan?

506
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,471
I don't know,
but if you do,

507
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,840
I know that we'll
figure something out.

508
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:14,144
And now we've stirred it all
up, it's dumb to just drop it.

509
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:22,952
I can't believe
I'm just meeting you now.

510
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,697
I'll come back to visit.

511
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:36,933
Okay?

512
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,536
I promise.

513
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,807
Promise me
something else.

514
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,210
What?

515
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,514
That if you do leave now,

516
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,550
it's not because you're
afraid of what's going on.

517
00:40:54,717 --> 00:40:56,719
I'm not afraid
of what's going on.

518
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:03,226
Not with our dads.
With us.

519
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,606
No?

520
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:30,788
Okay.

521
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:36,059
Come on. I'll take you
to your car.

522
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,877
Alexis?

523
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:58,247
I do know
what's going on,

524
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,519
but I promise that's not
why I'm leaving.

525
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,521
No?

526
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:13,197
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I need to show you something before you leave.

527
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,677
How long is this
gonna take?

528
00:42:28,744 --> 00:42:30,580
Just a few minutes.

529
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,769
What is this place?

530
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:57,007
Well, when we were little, my parents got
in a fight and I followed my dad here.

531
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,909
He doesn't know
I know about it.

532
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:02,112
There's so much stuff.

533
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:09,351
I know.

534
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:11,621
Here. Look at this.

535
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,051
What's up here?

536
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,253
I have no idea. What?

537
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,200
Come up here.

538
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:26,797
It's plugged in.

539
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,271
Should we?

540
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:09,838
Jesus.

541
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:11,157
What?

542
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:12,409
I think that's my dad.

543
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:16,847
The one on the right.

544
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,215
He's handsome.

545
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,222
-Is the other one your dad?
-Yeah.

546
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,331
They look so happy.

547
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,742
Is that your mom, maybe?

548
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:50,079
No. Yours?

549
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:51,515
No.

550
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:55,985
She's so pretty.

551
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,338
No, wait. There's more.

552
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,412
Could this all be over a girl?

553
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:09,452
Maybe.

554
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:44,119
You coming down?

555
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:46,389
Yeah, one second.

556
00:49:05,407 --> 00:49:07,710
Look what I found!

557
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:11,347
Look, it's the one the girl
was wearing in the film.

558
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,219
Put it back.
Carefully.

559
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:23,492
Let's just leave everything
exactly as it was.

560
00:49:42,778 --> 00:49:45,181
Your dad seemed really
into that girl.

561
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,516
Yeah, they both did.

562
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,786
She was pretty.

563
00:49:50,853 --> 00:49:53,122
Thank you for bringing me here.

564
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:05,354
We should go.

565
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,664
Holy shit.

566
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,016
What?

567
00:53:23,017 --> 00:53:24,301
Stop the car.

568
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,535
Stop the car!

569
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:33,342
What the fuck?

570
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:38,447
What are you doing here?

571
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:40,583
Davis. Thank God.

572
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,451
I came to look for you.

573
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:45,487
Hi.

574
00:53:45,554 --> 00:53:47,022
I don't know
what happened.

575
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,923
I just can't get
the car to start.

576
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,326
I tried calling AAA, but I can't
get anybody on the phone.

577
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:52,927
There's no reception
or something.

578
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:54,829
-What?
-Is that her?

579
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:56,632
Davis, a tow's
gonna take forever.

580
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:58,401
We've got jumper cables
at the house.

581
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:02,305
Hi... again.

582
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:04,339
Maybe I left the
lights on overnight.

583
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,010
You know, it's Kristin's car and I
don't know what all the buttons do.

584
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:12,347
Well, we could jump it.

585
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:13,465
You think she can help?

586
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:14,516
Yep.

587
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,818
You okay?

588
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:18,554
Yeah, I'm okay.

589
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:19,772
You sure?

590
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:20,923
Yeah.

591
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:26,796
So, how did you find me?

592
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:29,964
I drove into the main part
of town. I just asked around.

593
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,437
So, Cassie, what brings
you all the way up here?

594
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:37,406
I'm here to talk to
Davis about something.

595
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,345
You mind giving us
just a second?

596
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:43,846
I called a lot.

597
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:47,015
You not picking up?

598
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,684
Yeah. I've got
bad, cell service.

599
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,458
Davis.

600
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:59,061
Your parents actually
asked me to find you.

601
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:02,565
But you didn't tell them
I was here, did you?

602
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,467
Yeah, I did.

603
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,135
-Cassie!
-I'm sorry. It was important to them.

604
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,541
Sweetie,

605
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:16,413
I wanted to wait until
we were alone...

606
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:23,986
Babe, your grandfather
passed away.

607
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,893
I'm so sorry.

608
00:55:33,728 --> 00:55:35,998
<i>The last time I saw him...</i>

609
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,101
I asked
about your dad,

610
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:45,040
and he...
freaked out...

611
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:50,747
and had, like,
a panic attack or something.

612
00:55:53,114 --> 00:55:54,682
This is my fault.

613
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,619
No.

614
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,653
No, no, no, sweetie.

615
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,889
Sweetie, he was old.

616
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:03,192
What was he like?

617
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:07,463
He was charming.
Smart.

618
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:12,067
But he was stubborn,
like my dad.

619
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,769
<i>Like your dad...</i>

620
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:15,837
I guess.

621
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,706
Davis, I need to
talk to you outside.

622
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,831
You didn't even know him.

623
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:46,802
I know. That's what makes
this so fucking sad.

624
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:52,907
I know you have to go now,

625
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:57,146
but please promise me this
isn't the last time I see you.

626
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:00,182
Of course.

627
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:05,188
Now, maybe this could...
This could work.

628
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,433
We're going to the funeral.

629
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:23,806
No. Absolutely not.

630
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:26,675
What?

631
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:29,545
If they wanted me there,
I'd have gotten a call.

632
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,146
Yeah, but
he's your dad too.

633
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:33,216
I am not going
to his house.

634
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,254
You wouldn't have
to go to Ronald's,

635
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,257
if that makes
a difference.

636
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:45,094
They're burying him at the family
cabin in the mountains tonight.

637
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,762
Just a quiet little thing
with Ronald and Marsha.

638
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:50,732
You owe us this because you never
let us meet our grandfather.

639
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,102
I mean, the least you can
do is let us say good-bye.

640
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:56,472
She's right.

641
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,084
They're running late.

642
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,853
The body won't be here
until the morning.

643
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:20,021
It's a good thing
he's dead.

644
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:22,659
It'd kill him to know
he was late to something.

645
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:29,030
There's a motel at the
base of the mountain...

646
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:31,132
by the gas station.

647
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,802
I think we'll stay the night
here, if that's okay with you.

648
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:39,275
Plenty of room, right?

649
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:49,251
Good. So we'll stay.

650
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:51,153
And I'll help with the body
in the morning.

651
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,662
Suit yourself. You can
stay in the basement.

652
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,902
Yeah, I'm hungry too.

653
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:09,438
Why don't you get those
little crackers from the car?

654
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,373
Dad! He's making
everyone dinner.

655
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,309
Well, if it's good,
maybe it's worth waiting for,

656
01:00:18,246 --> 01:00:21,916
come join us.

657
01:00:27,155 --> 01:00:28,824
We're drinking
your wine, so...

658
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:40,469
Can you
cut those up smaller?

659
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,804
Yeah, sure.

660
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:44,338
Quickly, sweetie.

661
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:46,208
Fine. I'm not as good
at this as you are.

662
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,527
Fine. I'll do it.

663
01:00:47,528 --> 01:00:48,778
I can do it.

664
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,684
Hey, are you doin' okay?

665
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,697
I'm sorry for how
I behaved last week.

666
01:01:11,032 --> 01:01:13,235
But I think that
these last few days...

667
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,838
have been really good for me.

668
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,006
How about you?

669
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:20,408
Hey, anyone want some wine?

670
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,945
Maybe after I'm done.

671
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,814
It'll make it all go smoother.

672
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,085
And I'll come back and help
you cut stuff as well.

673
01:01:30,585 --> 01:01:32,221
Thanks.

674
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,056
Can I
have some too?

675
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:36,793
Yeah, sure.

676
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:47,034
This is a cool house.

677
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:48,403
I'm glad you like it.

678
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,143
Dinner's almost ready.

679
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,811
Good.

680
01:02:02,016 --> 01:02:03,418
Want to sit down?

681
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,125
If not, we can make
you a to-go plate.

682
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,328
Ronnie, I'm kidding,
please.

683
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:16,999
We should be able
to handle this.

684
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,323
Do you want
some wine?

685
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:44,025
Don't bother.
He doesn't like wine.

686
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,533
I'll get him
his drink.

687
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,085
Do you need help
with something?

688
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,054
Just some Red Label.

689
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:16,424
-He's down there?
-Yeah.

690
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,163
How'd you pull that off?

691
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,298
It's easy to despise someone
from a distance.

692
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:26,367
Put them across a table,
though,

693
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:29,204
most men won't pursue a
conflict if they can help it.

694
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,809
Your dad's
a great example.

695
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,345
Of what?

696
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,282
A coward.

697
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,130
That's your drink, right?

698
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,217
Good memory.

699
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:19,889
So, who's gonna
lose it tonight?

700
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:22,391
You are.

701
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:27,163
No, not me.

702
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:32,134
What are you guys
talking about?

703
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:35,003
May I?

704
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:45,113
Ronnie and I spent every
summer here growing up.

705
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:47,181
One summer,
we were alone,

706
01:04:47,248 --> 01:04:49,985
so every weekend was 48
hours straight of drinking.

707
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,056
Every few weekends
we'd wake up to see...

708
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,490
that someone had
vomited somewhere.

709
01:04:56,557 --> 01:04:58,626
I'd accuse Ronnie of not being
able to hold his liquor.

710
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:01,195
He'd accuse me.

711
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:04,032
But neither of us
could remember.

712
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:09,971
Ronnie, being the prankster he
was, suggested an experiment.

713
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,573
We ate pasta for dinner.

714
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:14,408
I had marinara,
he had Alfredo.

715
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:17,311
Josh, if you're gonna
tell it, tell it right.

716
01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:20,482
I had marinara
and you had Alfredo.

717
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,485
We threw the biggest party
of the summer.

718
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:29,324
And we probably drank a little
bit more than we should've.

719
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:32,059
So in the morning,

720
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:33,762
the vomit...

721
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:38,000
was either red or white.

722
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,469
And then we'd know
whose it was.

723
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,477
So...

724
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,346
what color was it?

725
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,518
It was pink.

726
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:03,759
What's so funny?

727
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:06,193
Why did you tell that story?

728
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,730
I still think
it was you.

729
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:19,340
Did I hear them laughing
down there?

730
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:21,108
Yeah, look
what we've done.

731
01:06:21,175 --> 01:06:23,277
Well, it's still early.

732
01:06:23,344 --> 01:06:25,379
So, we should
get them all drunk.

733
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,215
How much have you had?

734
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:28,682
Just a little bit.

735
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,719
Babe, the table is set.

736
01:06:31,786 --> 01:06:34,321
Family meeting.
Do not disturb.

737
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:36,724
What?

738
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,393
Sorry.
What I meant to say is,...

739
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,396
Go away.

740
01:06:50,405 --> 01:06:53,175
Alexis, you may never
speak like that...

741
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,110
to my girlfriend.

742
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,144
-What did I...
-Do you understand?

743
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,449
Why are you
being so mean?

744
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,550
Because you're acting
like a little fucking girl.

745
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:06,688
You treat me so
differently around her.

746
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:11,126
Look, I know
that what happened...

747
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,829
was really, really
fucked up, okay?

748
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,331
No, it wasn't.

749
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:16,765
Yes!

750
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:19,166
Yes, it was.

751
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:21,402
And we'll deal with it,
okay?

752
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:22,870
I promise.
We will, later.

753
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,739
But the way
that you're acting now,

754
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:26,708
you're making me
regret all this.

755
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:30,278
Coming here and meeting
you... everything.

756
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:35,150
Look...

757
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,356
Jesus fucking Christ,
Alexis!

758
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:45,728
What are you gonna do?
Tell on me?

759
01:07:48,396 --> 01:07:51,500
It's all so fun
because they're right there.

760
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,168
We're done,
you understand me?

761
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:56,304
You'll never see me again
after tomorrow.

762
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:12,855
Let's eat.

763
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:51,012
It's good.

764
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,778
Alexis,
where did you get that?

765
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,887
You know where I got it.

766
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:36,623
May I see that, please?

767
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,594
Sweetie, take that off
and hand it to me now.

768
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,100
Now!

769
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,836
What else have ya got,
Josh?

770
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,771
I didn't think you'd want
any of her stuff.

771
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:51,672
At the end, you wanted
nothing to do with Rebecca.

772
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:53,608
Don't you dare
mention her name.

773
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:55,543
And you shouldn't
assume anything.

774
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:58,078
Let's see if I'm in the will,
then maybe we can negotiate.

775
01:11:58,145 --> 01:11:59,514
That's the reason
why you're here.

776
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,384
Well, what if it is? What are
you gonna do, disown me again?

777
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:03,984
-I know it's your hobby.
-Give that to me.

778
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:05,953
-Give it to me!
-Ronnie, no.

779
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,688
-Alexis, come over here.
-Give it to me.

780
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,158
-Give that to me!
-Alexis, give it to me.

781
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:13,027
Let's bring it upstairs, then we can all
figure out what we want to do with it.

782
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:15,563
-Please...
-Shut up, Cassie!

783
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:18,166
This is not your family.
You need to fucking leave!

784
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,436
Why? So you can have your
cousin all to yourself?

785
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:31,179
What was that?

786
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,648
I saw you two upstairs. There's
obviously something going on.

787
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:36,385
What? Th-That's not true!

788
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,022
Cassie, that's not true.

789
01:12:47,628 --> 01:12:49,096
What is going on here,
Josh?

790
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,500
I don't know.
Don't look at me.

791
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,202
All of you.

792
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,570
<i>You, you!</i>

793
01:12:56,637 --> 01:12:58,573
Stay away from my son!

794
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,075
There's something wrong with you, Josh.
You're sick.

795
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,710
And you passed it along
to your kids.

796
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:04,112
Don't you dare!

797
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,913
You fucking pervert!

798
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:08,684
You took advantage of her,
Josh.

799
01:13:10,618 --> 01:13:11,987
You took advantage of her.

800
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,856
You killed Rebecca and you know
goddamn well that you did!

801
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,795
Stop it!

802
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:22,663
No!

803
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,666
Stop! Stop it!

804
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:29,938
Get off, get off him!

805
01:13:31,605 --> 01:13:34,908
Davis! Davis!
Davis! Davis!

806
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,110
Stop it!

807
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,181
Mind your business,
you jealous cunt!

808
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:43,550
Why the fuck should I
be jealous of you?

809
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:45,987
Because Davis hasn't been able to keep
his eyes off me since he got here.

810
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,122
And I think he's happy
you had that abortion...

811
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:50,993
so that he doesn't
have to be stuck with you.

812
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,434
And in case you haven't realized,
your boyfriend and I...

813
01:14:22,657 --> 01:14:24,560
Alexis.

814
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:31,192
You know, my dad hired people who
are coming to take care of that.

815
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:33,060
Couldn't sleep.

816
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:35,229
Thought I'd help us
get out of here faster.

817
01:15:36,997 --> 01:15:39,067
You seen Cassie?

818
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,735
She took off, man.
Real early.

819
01:15:41,802 --> 01:15:44,805
I asked if she'd be back.
She said "no."

820
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:47,942
How's your face?

821
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:53,180
We should see your dad
before we declare a winner.

822
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,020
So are you
a murderer, Josh?

823
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,923
If I am,
then your dad is too.

824
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:03,559
What did you do?

825
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:07,128
I need some help.

826
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:09,797
Come here.

827
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:24,411
You know, you and I are more
alike than you might think.

828
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,914
How's that?

829
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,783
Well, your dad's a man of
careful words and thoughts.

830
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,086
But when I saw you punch
Alexis, it clicked.

831
01:16:33,154 --> 01:16:34,889
I don't follow.

832
01:16:34,956 --> 01:16:37,792
If you'd thought about it,
you would've never done it.

833
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,961
But you did.

834
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,131
There are lots of things that
are out of our control, Davis.

835
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,768
Almost everything is,
actually.

836
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,136
So you stole
his girl?

837
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:52,239
This... Rebecca.

838
01:16:52,306 --> 01:16:54,742
And he never
forgave you.

839
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:13,628
Rebecca was our sister.

840
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:24,005
Your dad found out about us
and he told the entire family.

841
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:26,173
They shunned us
and it ruined her life.

842
01:17:27,341 --> 01:17:29,777
He shamed her
into killing herself.

843
01:17:32,846 --> 01:17:36,784
Come on, Davis. From what we heard last
night, are you in any place to judge?

844
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,722
I know how you
feel about her.

845
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:45,359
Your dad will never
forgive you for it.

846
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:48,797
But I will.

847
01:19:37,404 --> 01:19:39,539
Davis,

848
01:19:39,606 --> 01:19:41,208
I was thinking.

849
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:46,847
Maybe I could take your car
back and you could ride with...

850
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:15,076
We don't have to ever
talk about this again.

851
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,484
We can talk about it.

852
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:28,656
That girl, your cousin,

853
01:20:28,722 --> 01:20:31,193
she's just
like my brother.

854
01:20:32,726 --> 01:20:34,427
How's that?

855
01:20:34,494 --> 01:20:36,597
Dangerous.

856
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:42,336
Your behavior,

857
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:45,306
your feelings for her,

858
01:20:45,372 --> 01:20:47,507
it's curiosity,
it's... it's...

859
01:20:47,574 --> 01:20:50,478
From not having known her.

860
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:52,046
It's not...

861
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,547
Dad...

862
01:20:53,613 --> 01:20:54,932
You know.

863
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,250
Please.

864
01:21:04,057 --> 01:21:05,860
I'm sorry.

865
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:17,939
For what?

866
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:23,878
For everything.

867
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:28,616
I guess I thought that...

868
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,921
getting our families together
would've been a good thing.

869
01:21:34,788 --> 01:21:37,125
And what do you think now?

870
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:45,599
I think they're assholes.

871
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:04,185
<i>-Hi, this is Cassie.
-Leave a message.</i>

872
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,188
Hey, Cass, it's me.

873
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,757
I'm back in town,
staying at Todd's,

874
01:22:09,823 --> 01:22:15,362
so you know where to find me
whenever you want to talk.

875
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,932
Okay. Bye.

876
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:26,673
Hey, chef, there's a girl out
back who's here to see you.

877
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,208
What?

878
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:31,313
I don't know. She says it's important.
She needs to talk to you.

879
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:35,042
Hi.

880
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:44,385
I-I drove past your
apartment a few times.

881
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:47,088
I saw you weren't there.

882
01:23:47,154 --> 01:23:50,425
I'm not living there
at the moment.

883
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:56,430
Did you guys break up?

884
01:24:06,173 --> 01:24:08,309
Do you wanna take a walk?

885
01:24:20,787 --> 01:24:22,522
Can you say something,
please?

886
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,493
You're making me
really self-conscious.

887
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:28,895
Come on.

888
01:24:28,962 --> 01:24:31,065
Let's get you home.

889
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,375
Come on.

890
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,623
Can I come visit you
sometime?

891
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,194
You just did.

892
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:20,782
Davis, I could tell her
what happened between us.

893
01:25:24,518 --> 01:25:26,654
What we did.

894
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,467
I love you.

895
01:25:41,534 --> 01:25:43,537
More than just family.
I...

896
01:25:46,673 --> 01:25:48,743
I love you.

897
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,489
What do we do
about this?

898
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:41,762
Nothing.

899
01:27:45,993 --> 01:27:48,396
Are you sure
you want me to do this?

900
01:27:54,734 --> 01:27:58,839
And if I do,
that's it?

901
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:03,110
Game on?

902
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:05,279
You promise?

903
01:28:08,882 --> 01:28:14,654
Even if you don't like
some of what you hear?

904
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:16,056
I told you...

905
01:28:17,757 --> 01:28:19,460
It's not about
whether I like the answers.

906
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:22,363
It's that
I get to know them.

907
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,431
I get to know everything...

908
01:28:24,497 --> 01:28:26,600
from now on.

909
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,404
Are you
pussying out?

910
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:33,608
No.

911
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,779
Okay.

912
01:28:38,845 --> 01:28:41,315
We'll start easy.

913
01:28:43,016 --> 01:28:45,720
Are you sexually attracted
to her?

914
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:51,858
One lie,
this game is done.

915
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,465
Are you sexually attracted
to your cousin?

916
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:03,104
Yes.

917
01:29:08,141 --> 01:29:12,045
Have you thought about
what it would be like...

918
01:29:12,112 --> 01:29:13,980
to sleep with her?

919
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,689
A lot?

920
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,130
Okay.

921
01:29:30,197 --> 01:29:32,500
That one stung a bit.

922
01:29:37,003 --> 01:29:39,006
Is it more
than physical attraction?

923
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:48,149
Maybe?

924
01:29:55,588 --> 01:29:57,024
I guess so, yeah.

925
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:04,564
Do you think you'd make
a good couple?

926
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,769
No.

927
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:15,975
Given the chance, if there
were no consequences,

928
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:17,944
would you do anything
with her?

929
01:30:23,149 --> 01:30:25,152
At one point...

930
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:29,990
I guess so, yeah.

931
01:30:33,627 --> 01:30:36,798
But now, no.
No way.

932
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,134
-Are you sure you want to be with me?
-Yes.

933
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:44,005
-You have no doubts?
-No.

934
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:52,646
Okay. Last question.

935
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:06,026
Did you actually...

936
01:31:06,092 --> 01:31:09,029
do anything at all
with her?

937
01:31:14,868 --> 01:31:16,537
No.

938
01:31:18,905 --> 01:31:21,042
No.

939
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:23,944
Nothing.

940
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,137
Okay.

941
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:57,645
Unpack your shit.
