Thank you, Charlie.
Say "hi" to Grandpa Joe for me.

33
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,020
Hey!

34
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,023
Are... Are you okay?

35
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,160
Sorry, but I had to do that.

36
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:09,262
I couldn't let you eat that poor mouse.

37
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,397
Things can't be that bad, can they?

38
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:15,768
Wow, sounds like you guys
haven't eaten in days.

39
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,703
You know, I bought these for my family,

40
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,138
but you're welcome to have one.

41
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,883
Glad you liked it.

42
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,821
Well, thanks, I appreciate it.

43
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:39,492
It's okay.
You don't have to pay me back.

44
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:41,961
I'm Charlie. Charlie Bucket.

45
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:49,969
Tom and Jerry.

46
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,305
Pleased to meet you.

47
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,008
Wow. Look at all that candy.
And every bit of it

48
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,443
made by the great
Mr. Willy Wonka himself.

49
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,046
It's the most incredible candy
anyone can imagine.

50
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:01,380
And if I keep saving up,

51
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:04,183
I'll be able to afford a real Wonka bar.

52
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,987
Someday, maybe for my birthday.

53
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:11,891
Oh, well, who needs a Wonka Bar anyway?

54
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,927
Nice meeting you, Tom and Jerry.

55
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,267
Charlie's late tonight.

56
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,302
He works too hard for a boy his age.

57
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,938
He needs more time to play.

58
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:27,173
With none of you out of bed in 20 years,

59
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,408
it takes a lot to keep us all going.

60
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:32,778
One day, I'm gonna get
out of this bed and help him.

61
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:36,082
Oh, Dad,
you've been saying that for years.

62
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:44,023
Hi, Mom.

63
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,059
Wake up everyone.
Charlie's home.

64
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:51,164
Hi, Grandpa George, Grandma Georgina.

65
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,233
Hi, Grandma Josephine.
Grandpa Joe.

66
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,437
Cabbage soup?
Is that your supper, Grandpa?

67
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,573
Well, it's everyone's supper, Charlie.

68
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,041
I'm tired of cabbage water.

69
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,978
Tonight, we're gonna have
a real banquet. Look.

70
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,246
Charlie, where did you get this?

71
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,515
I bought it with my salary.
I had two of them,

72
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:11,250
but I gave one to some new friends.

73
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,119
That was very generous of you, Charlie.

74
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,489
Well, I just hope these new
friends of yours appreciate it.

75
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:26,299
Wonka bar for a deserving boy?

76
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,801
Panhandlers.

77
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,136
No, thanks.

78
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,700
Last one.

79
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:22,481
And that makes 5,000 boxes
of Wonka bars delivered early.

80
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:25,384
I bet there's a big bonus
in that for me.

81
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,287
Now, was that just Wonka bars?

82
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,756
Or were there Scrumdidilyumptious, too?

83
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:32,925
Huh? What gives?

84
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:35,528
I knows I delivered that box.

85
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:41,467
Must've have left it on the truck.

86
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:52,611
I don't get it.
It's got to be somewhere.

87
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:15,168
You see, Charlie,

88
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,570
no one's seen Mr. Wonka
since he locked himself

89
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,673
in his own factory years and years ago.

90
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:23,509
But he still keeps putting out
the most delicious,

91
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:26,312
the most incredible candy
anyone can imagine.

92
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,846
But, Grandpa,

93
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:30,283
why did Mr. Wonka lock
himself up in his own factory?

94
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,050
Because of Slugworth.

95
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:35,754
Slugworth wanted to steal
all his recipes, every last one.

96
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,392
Oh, that Slugworth.
He was the worst.

97
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,959
And it was on that fateful day

98
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:43,229
that Wonka closed
the gates of the factory.

99
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:46,165
And since then, no one ever comes out.

100
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,201
And no one ever comes in.

101
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,072
I got it.

102
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,310
Tom? Hey, Grandpa,
this is Tom and...

103
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:58,577
Where's Jerry?

104
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,521
Shh!

105
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,803
Uh... What's in the box, guys?

106
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,507
What are we waiting for?
Let's eat.

107
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,976
Grandpa, did you ever see so many?

108
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,211
But, how did you...

109
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:34,680
I mean, how did you guys
ever buy so many?

110
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:39,285
Uh... You guys
didn't buy these, did you?

111
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,523
I don't think
they did buy them, Charlie.

112
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm sorry, guys,
but these don't belong to us.

113
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:49,928
They have to go back.

114
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:23,262
Oh, I gotcha, you rotten candy thief.

115
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,967
I'll get you!

116
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,506
Nobody gives Spike the slip.

117
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,386
Huh?

118
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,924
Who put out the lights?

119
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,026
Whoa!

120
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:05,904
I'll get you, you lousy candy thieves!

00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:11,877

00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,558
Yes, Mr. Turkentine.

127
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,026
I shall need an assistant.
Come up here.

128
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,833
Now, mix together in the way
that only I know how

129
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,735
these extremely dangerous liquids

130
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:39,405
make the world's finest wart remover.

131
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:40,773
Pour 'em in, Charlie.

132
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,576
Whoa!

133
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:46,479
Did you see that?

134
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,080
- Did I do it wrong?
- Not at all.

135
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:51,183
This is for very large warts.

136
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,785
What's going on out there?

137
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,653
Willy Wonka is opening up his factory.

138
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,255
We just heard.
He's giving away tons of free chocolate.

139
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,424
Free chocolate?

140
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,825
But it's only for five people.

141
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,694
He's hidden five golden tickets,

142
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,796
and whoever finds them, wins
a lifetime supply of chocolate.

143
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,098
Golden tickets, eh?
Where has he hidden them?

144
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,400
Inside five Wonka bars.

145
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:10,002
You gotta buy Wonka bars
to find the tickets.

146
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,538
Class dismissed.

147
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,256
Tom, Jerry, did you hear that?

148
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:33,626
Boy, if only I had some Wonka bars.

149
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,630
Hey, it's a Wonka box.

150
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,065
There must be
a hundred Wonka bars in there.

151
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,299
Good work, guys.

152
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:43,068
We're sure to find a golden...

153
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:48,574
Sorry, but those Wonka bars
don't belong to us.

154
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,047
It's official.

155
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:57,516
Wonkamania has descended on the globe.

156
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,752
Hidden among countless
billions of Wonka bars

157
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:02,855
are five golden tickets,
and the people who find them

158
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,559
will win the most fabulous prize
anyone could wish for.

159
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,461
Do you think I've got a chance
to find one?

160
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,829
One?
I'll bet you find all five.

161
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:26,879
No! It's not right, guys.

162
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:29,748
Wait, this just in.

163
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:31,917
The first golden ticket has been found.

164
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,253
We go live to Dusselheim, Germany,

165
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,156
to meet the lucky winner,
Augustus Gloop.

166
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:41,694
I'm here with Augustus Gloop,
the pride of Dusselheim.

167
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,629
Augustus, how does it make you feel

168
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,330
to be the first golden ticket winner?

169
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:48,834
Hungry. This is gonna cost
Wonka a fortune in chocolate.

170
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,369
Mrs. Gloop,
you must be so proud.

171
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:52,571
Of course.

172
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,673
Augustus loves to eat chocolate.

173
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,509
It was only a matter of time
before he found

174
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,843
a golden ticket.

175
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:02,247
One down, four to go.

176
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,516
Don't worry, Charlie.

177
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,217
You'll find that golden ticket.

178
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,657
Huh?

179
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,796
Where's my golden ticket, Daddy?

180
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:19,532
Why haven't they found it yet?

181
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:21,133
Veruca, angel,

182
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,802
they've been working
for ten straight days.

183
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:27,472
Then make 'em work nights!
I want my golden ticket!

184
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,209
Sweetheart, there are only
four tickets left in the world,

185
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:33,846
and the whole world's
searching for them.

186
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,682
Mr. Salt, I've got it!
I've found it!

187
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,384
Give it to me, I want it.

188
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,153
I did it. I found it.

189
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:43,188
I found the golden ticket!

190
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,726
Anxiety runs high as the world
enters its 43rd day

191
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,294
in the hunt for golden tickets.

192
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,364
But today, the small town
of Miles City, Montana,

193
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,899
had reason to cheer.

194
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:56,569
I'm here with the winner
of the third golden ticket,

195
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,436
Ms. Violet Beauregarde, who...

196
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:00,072
Hi, friends, Sam Beauregarde here

197
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,674
with all today's
great giveaway bargains.

198
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,676
The finest values in the entire country.

199
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,510
Can it, Dad.
They don't care about you.

200
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,245
Hi, everyone.
Violet Beauregarde here,

201
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:09,848
and I found a golden ticket.
How do you like that?

202
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,316
Tell us how it happened, Violet.

203
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,085
Well, normally I'm a gum chewer.

204
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:15,320
I've been chewing this piece
for eight solid weeks.

205
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,589
When I heard about this Wonka thing,

206
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:17,923
I switched to chocolate.

207
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,858
But then, I went straight back to gum.

208
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,093
If I could just jump in here,

209
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,928
these deals are going fast, folks.

210
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:25,097
So, come on down while they last.

211
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:27,900
That's right, folks, there's only
one golden ticket still out there.

212
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,935
'Cause right here
in Marble Falls, Arizona,

213
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:31,804
is lucky winner number four.

214
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,539
Mike Teevee.
Mike, can we talk to you for a second?

215
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,308
Quiet. I'm trying
to watch the show.

216
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:38,443
He won't talk
until the commercial break.

217
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,778
Mike loves TV.

218
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:42,014
I serve all his meals right here.

219
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,749
What about that golden ticket, Mike?

220
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,483
Bang! Got you.

221
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,220
Relax, it's just a cap gun.

222
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,222
Isn't he the cutest thing?

223
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,127
- Only one golden ticket left.
- Don't worry, Charlie.

224
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:58,296
You've got as much chance of finding
that golden ticket as anyone.

225
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:02,835
It's okay. I'm happy with the
great scarf I got for my birthday.

226
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:06,071
There's one more present
for you, Charlie.

227
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,540
A Wonka bar?
Where did you get it?

228
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,175
I've been saving up.

229
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,410
When I had enough,
Tom and Jerry went to the store,

230
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:13,946
so I wouldn't have to get out of bed.

231
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:17,382
They bought the last Wonka bar in town.

232
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,617
Open her up, Charlie.

233
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:21,186
Show us that golden ticket.

234
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:25,590
You open it, Grandpa.
I'm too nervous.

235
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:30,763
Okay. Here goes.

236
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,202
You know, I bet those golden tickets

237
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,604
make the chocolate taste terrible.

238
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,046
Wonka bars are vanishing fast.

239
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:51,183
Local merchants, unable to
meet the demand, close early.

240
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,185
The nation's dwindling supply
of Wonka bars

241
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,220
is held under the tightest security.

242
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:59,024
It won't be long before finding
a Wonka bar is impossible.

243
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,927
Wait! It's over,
it's all over.

244
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,396
The fifth and final golden
ticket has been found.

245
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,364
The lucky winner
is millionaire industrialist

246
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:10,435
Alberto Minoleta of Paraguay,
who had this comment.

247
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,839
I've never been happier. Ole.

248
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:16,875
Turn it off. Poor Charlie.

249
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,577
Little boy's gotta have
some hope in this world.

250
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:21,747
What hope's he got left now?

251
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:23,648
We shouldn't tell Charlie tonight.

252
00:20:23,716 --> 00:20:26,985
Yeah, let the boy sleep.
Let him dream.

253
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,096
Oh. These must've gotten hidden
away during the contest.

254
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,298
Oh, well, at least I can restock.

255
00:21:57,742 --> 00:22:00,412
One Wonka bar it is.

256
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:03,548
Wait till Grandpa Joe sees this.

257
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,950
We're gonna have a feast.

258
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:14,092
We repeat, the fifth
golden ticket is a forgery.

259
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,028
Alberto Minoleta of Paraguay

260
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:18,897
has just been taken
into custody by the police.

261
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,532
Ay caramba.

262
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:23,501
Which means there is still
one golden ticket out there.

263
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:51,830
Look! Look!

264
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,598
The kid found the golden ticket!

265
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,000
The golden ticket!

266
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:59,204
Is this real?
Is that the real one?

267
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:01,206
- No, it mustn't be.
- Yes! It must be!

268
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,476
No, I wanna see it.

269
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:08,013
I wanna see the ticket.

270
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,815
Run straight home, Charlie.
Don't stop.

271
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,759
Congratulations, little boy.

272
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:24,362
You found the last golden ticket.

273
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:25,830
May I introduce myself?

274
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:29,167
Arthur Slugworth, president of
Slugworth Chocolates Incorporated.

275
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,004
Mr. Wonka is my sworn enemy.

276
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,572
He is currently developing
an incredible invention,

277
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,474
the everlasting gobstopper.

278
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,810
If he's successful, he'll bankrupt me.

279
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,178
So I need your help.

280
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:43,781
You must get a hold
of an everlasting gobstopper

281
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:45,017
and bring it to me,

282
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,818
so I can find the secret formula.

283
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,054
If you do as I say, you'll be rich.

284
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,655
A new house for your family.

285
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,926
Plenty of food and security
for the rest of their lives.

286
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:55,660

The fifth golden ticket is mine!

320
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,073
You're kidding, Charlie.
They're all gone.

321
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,807
Read it, Grandpa.

322
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:54,912
"Greetings to the finder of this
golden ticket from Mr. Willy Wonka."

323
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,581
"Bring this ticket to my factory...

324
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:59,251
...at 10:00 in the morning
on October the first...

325

"One member of your own family
may accompany you."

That's tomorrow!

00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:45,310
Grandpa, there's something else.

381
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:47,945
On the way home,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

382
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,491
Time to go, Grandpa Joe.
Don't forget the ticket.

383
00:29:59,557 --> 00:30:01,092
I've got it right here.

384
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:03,795
I can't believe we're really
gonna meet Mr. Willy Wonka.

385
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:06,264
I can't either, Charlie.

386
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:07,465
Good luck!

387
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,634
Oh, I'm gonna be late for work.

388
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,702
Bye.

389
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,546
In just ten minutes, at 10:00 a.m.,

390
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,316
the legendary Willy Wonka
will open his factory doors

391
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:26,050
for the five lucky ticket winners.

392
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,320
The anticipation is palpable.

393
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:25,209
Hey, Ma, we're on TV.

394
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:27,412
Look at me, I'm a star!

395
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,180
Hey, friends, Sam Beauregarde here.

396
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:30,715
If you're looking for bargains,

397
00:31:30,782 --> 00:31:32,116
don't forget to visit the
biggest car dealership...

398
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,685
Cut it out, Dad.
This is my show.

399
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,387
Hi, everyone! Still chewing.

400
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:38,756
Week 10 and counting.
Check out this stretch.

401
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,429
I'm going in before anyone else.

402
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:46,163
I want to be the first.

403
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,999
Yes, angel, of course.

404
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:50,702
Augustus, wait until we get inside.

405
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:15,627
Grandpa, I can't believe
we're actually going inside.

406
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:18,696
And we're gonna meet
Mr. Willy Wonka himself.

407
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:36,981
It's time now.

408
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:40,051
What's that?

409
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:44,155
What's taking so long?

410
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:54,331
So glorious.

411
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:55,533
Oh, dear.

412
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,101
Is he all right?

413
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:00,538
Some type of illness, maybe.

414
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:07,479
Should we help him?

415
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:32,103
Thank you!
Welcome, my friends!

416
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:35,907
Welcome. Today is going
to be such an exciting day.

417
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:39,010
But first, may I see your
golden tickets, please?

418
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:53,157
I'm Veruca Salt.

419
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,492
A pleasure, Veruca.

420
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,061
And how pretty you look
in that mink coat.

421
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:58,329
It's expensive.

422
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:00,665
And I have lots more at home.

423
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:04,135
Wonderful. And Mr. Salt,
would you please step this way.

424
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:06,538
Huh? Oh!

425
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:09,641
Augustus Gloop.

426
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:11,242
Good to see you, Augustus.

427
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:14,879
You're looking healthy, and
Mrs. Gloop, this way please.

428
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,218
Violet Beauregarde.

429
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:24,421
Darling child, welcome to my
chocolate factory.

430
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:26,257
Got any gum here?

431
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,029
Delightful, delightful!
Just over here, please.

432
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:33,464
Oh!

433
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,799
It was right here.

434
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:53,417
It's gotta be here somewhere.

435
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:54,886
I know I had that ticket.

436
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:57,722
Where could I have put it?

437
00:34:57,789 --> 00:34:59,957
I know I had it when I left the house.

438
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:03,260
The name's Mike Teevee.
Bang! Gotcha!

439
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:06,631
Wonderful to meet you, Mike.

440
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,900
Ooh. Where's that ticket?

441
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,635
Charlie...

442
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:13,871
Oh... Oh.

443
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:16,741
And, Mrs. Teevee,
what an adorable little boy.

444
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,142
This way, please.

445
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,945
- Charlie Bucket.
- Well, well, Charlie Bucket.

446
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:23,414
I read all about you.
So happy to meet you.

447
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,150
- And this is my Grandpa Joe.
- A pleasure, sir.

448
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:28,252
A joy, a delight.
Are we ready?

449
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:30,955
Good, in we go, everyone.

450
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,060
This way, please.

451
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:39,463
Hurry, please. We have
so much time and so little to see.

452
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,899
Wait, strike that. Reverse it.

453
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:06,090
- Who is it?
- Open the gate, you fool.

454
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:09,226
Just trying to be careful, boss.

455
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,864
Everything is going according to plan.

456
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,800
Charlie Bucket and the other
children suspect nothing.

457
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:17,468
By the end of the day,

458
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:19,971
Charlie Bucket will get exactly
what's coming to him.

459
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:21,839
And then this chocolate factory

460
00:36:21,906 --> 00:36:23,641
will have a new owner.

461
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:31,783
Enough. Lock the gate.

462
00:36:56,473 --> 00:37:01,112
That's it. I'm gonna get you candy
thieves if it's the last thing I...

463
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:09,887
Ha!

464
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,826
Come back here, you!

465
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:30,875
Gotcha!

466
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:44,756
Oh! My eyes.

467
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:47,358
That is delicious.

468
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:02,206
Oh, this won't end well.

469
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,043
It's more than I was expecting.

470
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:28,065
Who dares trespass
into my candy factory?

471
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:35,006
Don't you know it's dangerous down here?

472
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:37,775
Good thing I was able to
shut everything down.

473
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:40,677
I'm Tuffy.
I'm an Oompa Loompa.

474
00:38:40,744 --> 00:38:42,079
Intern.

475
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,117
You mean you never heard
of Oompa Loompas?

476
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:49,153
Why, they only run Wonka's
entire candy operation.

477
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,322
Mr. Wonka brought
them here years ago

478
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:53,825
from a strange and dangerous land.

479
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,326
They do the work,

480
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:57,328
and he gives them
a nice, safe place to live.

481
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:00,497
I wanted to be an Oompa Loompa,
more than anything.

482
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:04,135
But I didn't meet
the height requirement.

483
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:06,637
But if I keep trying as hard as I can,

484
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:10,441
I know I'll be accepted as an
Oompa Loompa someday.

485
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:14,078
Say, what are you guys
doing here, anyway?

486
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:17,181
Wow! Your friend found
a golden ticket?

487
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,383
Then he must be on the tour right now!

488
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:23,821
Slugworth?
Here in the factory?

489
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, he's up to no good, that's for sure.

490
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,259
We'd better warn Mr. Wonka.

491
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:34,131
If we go through here,
we can catch up with the tour.

492
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:36,700
I know it looks weird,
but it's totally safe.

493
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:40,104
Trust me, fellas, I know
everything about this factory.

494
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:47,011
Huh. I actually
didn't know about this.

495
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:55,486
Relax, fellas. I got you here,
didn't I?

496
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:57,354
Feast your eyes on

497
00:39:57,421 --> 00:39:59,523
the chocolate room.

498
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:03,427
This is the nerve center of

499
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:06,163
Willy Wonka's entire operation.

500
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,932
Everything here is edible.

501
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,434
Eatable. I mean,
you can eat it.

502
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:25,416
It's the tour. I figured
they'd come through here.

503
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:26,517
We better lay low.

504
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,453
Mr. Wonka's not
too crazy about cats.

505
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,357
Hold your breath.

506
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:34,625
Make a wish.

507
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,460

I'm gonna go warn
Mr. Wonka about Slugworth.

542
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:35,306
Maybe he'll even make me
an official Oompa Loompa.

543
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:42,045
Augustus, no!

544
00:43:42,113 --> 00:43:43,714
Please, dear boy, don't do that.

545
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,016
My chocolate river must never
be touched by human hands.

546
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:48,752
Help! Help!

547
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:51,922
My chocolate! My poor, sweet,
beautiful chocolate.

548
00:43:51,988 --> 00:43:53,324
Help me!

549
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,259
- Help!
- Grab hold!

550
00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:57,328
Don't just stand there, do something.

551
00:43:57,394 --> 00:43:59,496
- Help!
- When he floats around to this side,

552
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:01,498
Tom can dive in and save him.

553
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:04,601
Help me!
Get me out of here.

554
00:44:05,536 --> 00:44:07,804
What do you mean you can't swim?

555
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,574
Don't just stand there, do something!

556
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:13,277
Oh, it's too late.
The suction's got him.

557
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:22,753
Grab hold!

558
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:24,621
Where is my Augustus?

559
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:25,722
Oh, just watch the pipe.

560
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,228
So, what happens now?

561
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:33,697
Oh, the pressure will build up
and shoot him out like a bullet.

562
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,871
Take Mrs. Gloop straight to
the fudge room.

563
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:43,540
But hurry, before the child
gets poured into the boiler.

564
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:45,176
How could you let this happen?

565
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:48,212
I'm sorry, but all questions
must be submitted in writing.

566
00:44:48,279 --> 00:44:49,546

you running here, Wonka?

00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:38,195
Mesdames et messieurs,
prepare to embark, s'il vous plait.

582
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:40,231
Embark? Embark on what?

583
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,439
All aboard.

584
00:45:52,175 --> 00:45:55,145
Whoa! Good thing I taught
myself to breathe under chocolate

585
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:57,113
using sippie straws.

586
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,115
You sure this thing is safe, Wonka?

587
00:45:59,182 --> 00:46:01,117
Safe-ish would
be more accurate.

588
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:02,753
Step aboard, please.

589
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:06,156
Grandpa, I thought I saw
Tom and Jerry over by the river.

590
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:07,524
Tom and Jerry?

591
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:10,394
No, you must be
imagining things, Charlie.

592
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:31,682
Come on, guys.

593
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:34,285
We still have to warn
Mr. Wonka about Slugworth.

594
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:37,220
You will tell Wonka nothing,
small mouse.

595
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:39,089
Slugworth!

596
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:41,425
It seems the three of you have
become a danger to my master plan.

597
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:43,760
And so, you must be taken care of.

598
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:45,028
Gotcha, candy thief.

599
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:47,898
Thought I was diced up
and attractively packaged?

600
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:49,566
Well, guess again.

601
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:57,774
If you want Mr. Wonka's candy,
come and get it!

602
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,544
I'm blinded by sweetness!

603
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:08,285
No, what is...
Watch out!

604
00:47:14,391 --> 00:47:16,360
Looks like the suction's got 'em.

605
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:17,628
This is going to hurt!

606
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,436
That won't stop Slugworth for long.

607
00:47:25,502 --> 00:47:28,138
Good thing I always keep
a spare boat by the river.

608
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:34,978
Hop on.

609
00:47:44,388 --> 00:47:47,624
The ride might get a little rough.

610
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:56,833

Here we are, fellas.

628
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,065
Willy Wonka's fabulous invention room.

629
00:49:03,434 --> 00:49:04,835
I know it looks a mess,

630
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,603
but this is where
Mr. Wonka creates

631
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,872
all his amazing inventions.

632
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:12,375
Including this here
sticky-looking wallpaper.

633
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:15,946
It's sticky as all get-out,

634
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:18,782
but it's pretty tasty.

635
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:20,917
Mmm. Banana.

636
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:26,289
No, don't, please!

637
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:29,259
I'm sorry but this is the most
top-secret device in my factory.

638
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:32,629
Old Slugworth would give anything
to get his hands on this.

639
00:49:32,696 --> 00:49:34,598
- What's it do?
- Well...

640
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:36,667
If you really wanna know.

641
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:41,337
Stretch your tail out, Jerry.

642
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:44,074
I'll try to pull you free.

643
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,611
What is it?

644
00:49:47,678 --> 00:49:49,279
It's an everlasting gobstopper.

645
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:51,782
You can suck 'em forever and
they'll never get any smaller.

646
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:53,750
I want an everlasting gobstopper!

647
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:55,652
- Me too.
- All right.

648
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,088
But I can only give them
to you if you solemnly swear

649
00:49:58,154 --> 00:50:00,724
to keep them secret and
never show them to anyone

650
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,125
for as long as you live.

651
00:50:02,192 --> 00:50:04,495
- Agreed?
- Agreed!

652
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:06,697
Here you go, there's one for everyone.

653
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,565
Wow.

654
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:17,508
Jerry?

655
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:24,781
Ooh, Charlie, look!
There's Tom.

656
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:27,117
Tom, what happened to you?

657
00:50:30,721 --> 00:50:32,055
Hey, there, I'm Tuffy.

658
00:50:32,122 --> 00:50:34,257
You must be Tom
and Jerry's friend, Charlie.

659
00:50:34,324 --> 00:50:35,626
Nice to meet you, Tuffy.

660
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:37,393
But, what are you three doing here?

661
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,729
We're here to warn Mr. Wonka

662
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:40,797
about his archenemy, Slugworth.

663
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:43,366
Tom and Jerry saw him
sneak into the factory.

664
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:44,568
Slugworth again!

665
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,537
We'd better tell Mr. Wonka.

666
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:52,743
My wall! My beautiful,
beautiful licking wall.

667
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:00,016
Is this cat fur?

668
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,352
Now the factory will
have to be triple-sanitized.

669
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:05,255
Whoever's responsible
will be permanently banished

670
00:51:05,321 --> 00:51:06,957
from the premises forever.

671
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,191
Permanently!

672
00:51:11,562 --> 00:51:13,797
Oh, that's not cat fur,
Mr. Wonka.

673
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:17,233
Some of my mustache came off
when I was licking this wall.

674
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,236
Are you sure?

675
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:22,172
Absolutely.

676
00:51:29,846 --> 00:51:31,648
My mistake. Please forgive me.

677
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:33,016
Now, if you'll follow me,

678
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:35,552
I have something
very special to show you.

679
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:37,487
It's a three-course dinner.

680
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:39,790
Hey, check it out.
Some kind of weird gum.

681
00:51:39,856 --> 00:51:41,424
Oh, Violet, please give it back.

682
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:43,727
That's dinner-gum and it's not
ready for human consumption.

683
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:45,061
You heard Mr. Wonka, honey.

684
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:48,098
Zip it, Dad, it's gum.
That's my thing.

685
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:49,766
Mmm.

686
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,268
Stop. Don't. Come back.

687
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:53,870
Mmm. Wow.

688
00:51:53,937 --> 00:51:55,471
It's like a
full-course dinner.

689
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:56,773
I can actually taste it.

690
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,642
Tomato soup and roast beef.

691
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:00,176
It's delicious!

692
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:02,579
We have to warn Mr. Wonka
about Slugworth, Grandpa.

693
00:52:02,646 --> 00:52:04,347
But if Wonka finds out about Tom,

694
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:05,782
he'll throw us all out.

695
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:08,151
You'll lose the lifetime
supply of chocolate.

696
00:52:08,218 --> 00:52:11,554
Mmm. Oh, boy!
That was terrific.

697
00:52:11,622 --> 00:52:13,556
And wait... Mmm.

698
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:15,291
Here comes the dessert.

699
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,561
Blueberry pie!
It's incredible.

700
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:20,631
Hey, what's going on? Violet?

701
00:52:20,697 --> 00:52:22,298
You're turning violet, Violet!

702
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:24,167
What are you talking about?

703
00:52:24,234 --> 00:52:25,902
Her face! It's all blue.

704
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:28,271
I know, she's turning into a blueberry.

705
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:30,874
It always happens when
you reach the dessert.

706
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:32,609
Oh, well.
I'll get it right in the end.

707
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:35,178
I feel funny.

708
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:40,684
Would you roll the little girl down to
the juicing room at once?

709
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:42,786
She'll have to be squeezed immediately.

You can't let your family lose
that lifetime supply of chocolate.

715
00:52:58,434 --> 00:52:59,569
But what about Slugworth?

716
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:00,637
You stay with the tour.

717
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,272
Leave Slugworth to us.

718
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:03,439
Thanks, Tuffy.

719
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:05,341

I'll get you for this, Wonka!

730
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:40,443
I got a blueberry for a daughter.

731
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,012
Well, well, well.

732
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:45,381
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.

733
00:53:45,448 --> 00:53:48,819
Three good, sweet little children left.

734
00:53:48,885 --> 00:53:51,254
Shall we move on?

735
00:53:51,321 --> 00:53:54,057
You're going to love
this next invention.

736
00:53:57,828 --> 00:53:59,295
What's it doing, Mr. Wonka?

737
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:01,397
It's making fizzy lifting drinks.

738
00:54:01,464 --> 00:54:03,033
The drink fills you with gas

739
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:05,401
and the gas lifts you right
off the ground like a balloon.

740
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:07,003
Wow. Gosh.

741
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,872
I want a fizzy lifting drink.

742
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:11,274
No, no, sorry.
I can't release them.

743
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,243
There'd be children
flying around everywhere.

744
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:14,745
Now, come along.

745
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:18,448
All this excitement's made me thirsty.

746
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:19,582
Let's take a drink.

747
00:54:19,649 --> 00:54:20,751
I don't know, Grandpa.

748
00:54:20,817 --> 00:54:23,186
Come on, one small drink won't hurt us.

749
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:27,223
Okay.

750
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:31,762
Ah.

751
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:33,997
Mmm. Pretty good.

752
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:35,598
I don't feel any different.

753
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:37,000
Me neither.

754
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,202
Frankly, I'm a little dissapoin...

755
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:42,773
I... I feel so strange.

756
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:45,541
Hey! It's fun, Grandpa,
come on.

757
00:54:45,608 --> 00:54:47,778
Oh. Okay, Charlie.

758
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:51,047
Whee!

759
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:04,961
Tom! Quit playing around
with that gobstopper machine.

760
00:55:12,002 --> 00:55:13,970
Oh, fudge! That didn't work!

761
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:34,257
An everlasting gobstopper.

762
00:55:34,324 --> 00:55:35,992
If Slugworth gets his hands on it,

763
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,660
Mr. Wonka will be ruined.

764
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,962
We'd better hide this thing.

765
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:40,596
You three will hide nothing.

766
00:55:40,663 --> 00:55:43,699
You have interfered with my
master plan for the last time.

767
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:45,535
You tell him, boss.

768
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,103
Give me that gobstopper!

769
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,105
Hang on to that gobstopper, Tom!

770
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:50,941
I'll help you, boss.

771
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:57,680
Uh-oh! Look out, Tom!

772
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:00,851
Ha! Now, I have you.

773
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:02,318
This is amazing.

774
00:56:02,385 --> 00:56:03,486
I'm a jet plane.

775
00:56:03,553 --> 00:56:05,288
I'm a rocket ship!

776
00:56:05,355 --> 00:56:07,858
I'm... I'm getting
too close to that fan!

777
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:10,793
Hey, Grandpa!
I can't stop myself.

778
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:12,128
Charlie, look out!

779
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:13,729
We'll get cut to ribbons!

780
00:56:13,796 --> 00:56:15,966
- Help! Please help us!
- Help!

781
00:56:16,032 --> 00:56:18,201
Cough up the gobstopper.

782
00:56:18,268 --> 00:56:21,371
Hang on, Tom!
Don't let go!

783
00:56:25,808 --> 00:56:28,144
Dinner gum. Good idea, Jerry.

784
00:56:28,945 --> 00:56:30,881
Mmm. Hey, that's not bad.

785
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:34,117
Oh. There goes the diet.

786
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:39,622
What?
Get back, you fool!

787
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:42,658
Sorry, coming through.

788
00:56:42,725 --> 00:56:44,027
Run, fellas!

789
00:56:44,094 --> 00:56:47,097
We can't let Slugworth
get that gobstopper.

790
00:56:47,163 --> 00:56:51,001
Oh, I'm really regretting
some life choices here.

791
00:56:51,067 --> 00:56:54,604
You purple, bloated imbecile!

792
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:02,178
- Help!
- Help!

793
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:03,579
Mr. Wonka!

794
00:57:03,646 --> 00:57:05,315
- Please, someone.
- Help.

795
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:08,318
- Help us.
- Help!

796
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,586
Be careful.

797
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:12,588
Help!

798
00:57:12,655 --> 00:57:14,657
- Help us!
- There's nothing to grab onto.

799
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:15,959
We gotta get them to burp

800
00:57:16,026 --> 00:57:17,627
before they're chopped up by that fan.

801
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:22,065
Oh, my goodness. Oh, Charlie!

802
00:57:22,132 --> 00:57:23,934
Please help us!

803
00:57:28,771 --> 00:57:30,406
Help!

804
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:33,977
Someone, please...

805
00:57:34,044 --> 00:57:36,179
Anyone, if you can hear us...

806
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:44,054
- I'm going down.
- No!

807
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,089
Burp, Charlie, you gotta burp.

808
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:53,596
I'm going down, too.

809
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:00,636
That was a close one.
Come on.

810
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:04,174
We need to catch up with the others.

811
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,577
Come on, fellas, we gotta get that
gobstopper to a safe place.

812
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:12,048
The safest place for that
gobstopper is in my hand.

813
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:18,621
No! Put down that
fizzy lifting drink.

814
00:58:30,266 --> 00:58:32,402
Good thinking, Jerry, let's fly.

815
00:58:36,939 --> 00:58:39,275
Stop! I order you to...

816
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,215
Quick, drink this!

817
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:48,018
Thanks, but I'm more of a lemonade guy.

818
00:59:06,236 --> 00:59:08,304
Again with the eyes!

819
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:16,046
Watch out for those
peppermint spikes, Spike.

820
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:45,075
We're miles below the factory

821
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,976
in Mr. Wonka's
rock candy mines.

822
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:50,280
Slugworth will never find us
or that gobstopper down here.

823
00:59:50,346 --> 00:59:52,715
Guess again, Mouse.

824
00:59:52,782 --> 00:59:54,084
Unfortunately for you,

825
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,087
I happen to be
an accomplished spelunker.

826
00:59:57,153 --> 00:59:58,588
Into the mine car, guys!

827
00:59:58,654 --> 01:00:00,856
Quick!
We cannot let them get away.

828
01:00:00,923 --> 01:00:03,359
Geese, laying golden eggs.

829
01:00:03,426 --> 01:00:06,396
Chocolate golden eggs,
and only the finest.

830
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:08,998
As you can see, these are
quadruple-sized geese

831
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:11,434
and they lay
octuple-sized eggs.

832
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:16,038
My educated
Eggdicator examines every egg.

833
01:00:16,106 --> 01:00:18,774
The good ones are kept and polished up.

834
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:20,843
The bad eggs

835
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,245
are dropped down the chute.

836
01:00:45,668 --> 01:00:49,038
Daddy, I want you to buy me
a golden goose.

837
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,473
Uh...

838
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,609
I want you to buy me
one of those golden geese!

839
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,145
Whatever you say, honey.

840
01:00:55,211 --> 01:00:56,946
How much for the golden goose, Wonka?

841
01:00:57,012 --> 01:00:59,415
Out of the question.
I couldn't part with them.

842
01:01:00,216 --> 01:01:02,818
I want my golden goose.

843
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:04,220
And if I don't get it,

844
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:08,158

So, where'd it send her?

869
01:02:25,668 --> 01:02:27,370
Where it sends all the other bad eggs.

870
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:28,971
Down the garbage chute.

871
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:30,773
The garbage chute.

872
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,642
Which, of course, leads to the furnace.

873
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:33,876
The furnace?

874
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:36,212
She'll be broiled like a bratwurst.

875
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:38,348
Maybe she's just stuck inside the tube.

876

Veruca, are you all right?

887
01:03:12,682 --> 01:03:15,285
No! I don't have
a golden goose

888
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:18,288
and now I'm covered with garbage!

889
01:03:18,354 --> 01:03:20,656
We're in a furnace!

890
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,366
Out of my way, cat!

891
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:36,939
I want you to take me home

892
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:39,875
and buy me my own
chocolate factory, Daddy.

893
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:42,978
No, you're lucky neither of us
were burned to a crisp.

894
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:44,580
You're going to learn some discipline

895
01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:47,182
- when we get home, Miss Salt.
- No!

896
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:09,939
Wonkavision, my latest
and greatest invention.

897
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:12,241
So, it's just television?

898
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:14,344
Uh, it's Wonkavision. Observe.

899
01:04:18,348 --> 01:04:20,816
Lights, camera, Wonkavision!

900
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,388
What happened to the chocolate?

901
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:27,390
It's flying over our heads
in a zillion pieces

902
01:04:27,457 --> 01:04:29,291
and it gets reassembled over there.

903
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,693
Of course, the chocolate gets smaller

904
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,496
when we beam it through.
Just like on regular TV.

905
01:04:33,563 --> 01:04:35,631
I bet old Slugworth would pay a fortune

906
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:38,000
- to find out about this.
- Shh.

907
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,339
- It's delicious.
- It's a miracle.

908
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:44,674
It's Wonkavision.

909
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,909
Can you send people through this thing?

910
01:04:46,976 --> 01:04:48,243
People? Hmm...

911
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,779
I suppose I could.

912
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:53,215
Yes, yes, I'm sure I could.
Could get messy, though.

913
01:04:53,282 --> 01:04:54,384
Check it out, Mom,

914
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,718
I'm going to be the first person

915
01:04:55,785 --> 01:04:57,252
to be sent by television.

916
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,154
Mike, get away from there!

917
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:00,390
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

918
01:05:00,456 --> 01:05:02,858
Lights, camera, action!

919
01:05:02,925 --> 01:05:04,059
Sweetie, no!

920
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:07,697
Where is he?

921
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:10,800
He's flying over our heads
in a zillion pieces.

922
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:14,904
Look everybody, I'm on TV.

923
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,407
Wait till everybody back home sees this.

924
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:19,274
No one's gonna see anything.

925
01:05:19,341 --> 01:05:21,644
Hey, Mom, what are you doing?

926
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:22,912
Stop!

927
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:26,949
Take the boy down
to the taffy pulling room.

928
01:05:27,016 --> 01:05:29,752
We should have him stretched

Mike? Veruca?

936
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,477
My dear boy, I promise you
they'll be all right.

937
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:56,912
They'll all soon be restored

What's next, Mr. Wonka?

940
01:06:00,516 --> 01:06:03,318
Oh, well, uh, this concludes the tour.

941
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:04,754
I hope you enjoyed it.

942
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,288
You can show yourselves out.
Just up this hall.

943
01:06:06,355 --> 01:06:08,458
I'm terribly busy.
The entire day's been wasted.

944
01:06:08,524 --> 01:06:09,992
Thank you. Good-bye.

945
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:15,064
Did we do something wrong?

946
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,932
Charlie. Grandpa Joe.

947
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:18,801
Tom. Jerry. Tuffy.

948
01:06:18,868 --> 01:06:19,735
Bad news, guys.

949
01:06:19,802 --> 01:06:21,804
Slugworth's got the gobstopper.

950
01:06:21,871 --> 01:06:24,339
Oh, no! If he cracks
the secret formula,

951
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:26,075
Mr. Wonka will be ruined.

952
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:27,342
We can't let him get away.

953
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:29,078
Don't worry.

954
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:32,515
I think I can track him
with these TV monitors.

955
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:36,385
Uh...

956
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:37,953
I don't see him.

957
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:42,191
There he is. Tom found him.

958
01:06:43,526 --> 01:06:44,994
They're leaving the factory.

959
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,330
Not if I can grab him
with this Wonkavision remote.

960
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,037
Ooh...

961
01:06:56,205 --> 01:06:58,474
Hey, uh, how did we get here?

962
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,909
We've been Wonkavisioned.

963
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:02,545
We got you right where
we want you, Slugworth.

964
01:07:02,612 --> 01:07:05,247
Now, hand over that tiny gobstopper!

965
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:12,421
Oh, my heaven.

966
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:14,590
I'm a big boy now.

967
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:17,059
Tom, you reversed the signal!

968
01:07:19,729 --> 01:07:21,063
Now you will pay the price

969
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,066
for interfering with my master plan.

970
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:25,968
Tom, press more buttons.

971
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,084
Whoa!

972
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:53,696
I think I'm getting dizzy.

973
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:58,568
A-ha!

974
01:07:59,101 --> 01:08:00,369
Gotcha.

975
01:08:07,142 --> 01:08:09,078
I have you now, cat.

976
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:15,184
My offer still stands, Charlie Bucket.

977
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,586
With two gobstoppers,

978
01:08:16,652 --> 01:08:18,854
I could rule the candy world.

979
01:08:19,254 --> 01:08:20,590
Join me.

980
01:08:24,627 --> 01:08:26,128
Hey, what the...

981
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:29,064
Charlie, pass me the remote.

982
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:33,769
Stop!

983
01:08:34,937 --> 01:08:36,706
No! Oh!

984
01:08:36,772 --> 01:08:37,973
My gobstopper!

985
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,875
I've beamed it into a million pieces.

986
01:08:39,942 --> 01:08:41,410
You'll never get it back.

987
01:08:41,476 --> 01:08:43,613
You'll pay for this, mouse.

988
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:59,228
I'll help you, boss.

989
01:08:59,294 --> 01:09:01,230
No! Put that down, you fool.

990
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:12,842
Charlie, dear boy, how perfect.

991
01:09:12,908 --> 01:09:15,410
Now you and I can be partners.

992
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:19,514
Our gobstopper will make us
kings of the candy world.

993
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:21,684
It will make your family rich.

994
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:24,353
Let me have that remote, son.

995
01:09:24,419 --> 01:09:26,922
You won't need it anymore.

996
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:29,959
Charlie!

997
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:39,568
Hey, you beamed him
into a zillion pieces.

998
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:41,837
It'll take a while before
they could put themselves

999
01:09:41,904 --> 01:09:44,073
back together again.

1000
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:47,076
Hey, look, the camera added four inches.

1001
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:50,112
I bet I meet the Oompa Loompa
height requirement now.

1002
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:52,547
Well, good riddance to Slugworth, I say.

1003
01:09:52,614 --> 01:09:55,851
Come on, Charlie, we got some
business to attend to.

1004
01:10:01,356 --> 01:10:02,892
Excuse me, Mr. Wonka?

1005
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:04,960
I am incredibly busy, sir.

1006
01:10:05,027 --> 01:10:08,063
Um, but what about Charlie's
lifetime supply of chocolate?

1007
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,632
- When does he get it?
- He doesn't.

1008
01:10:11,433 --> 01:10:12,935
What? Why not?

1009
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:15,537
Because he broke the factory rules.

1010
01:10:15,604 --> 01:10:16,906
What factory rules?

1011
01:10:16,972 --> 01:10:18,540
We didn't see any rules.

1012
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:20,242
Wrong, sir, wrong.

1013
01:10:20,309 --> 01:10:24,079
Under section 37 of the
contract signed by him,

1014
01:10:24,146 --> 01:10:28,083
all offers shall become null
and void, etc., etc., etc...

1015
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,953
You stole fizzy lifting drinks.

1016
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,255
And to make matters worse,

1017
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:35,590
you allowed a cat into my factory.

1018
01:10:35,657 --> 01:10:38,127
A cat and his two filthy mice friends.

1019
01:10:38,193 --> 01:10:40,796
Now the entire factory
will have to be sterilised.

1020
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:42,732
So you get nothing!

1021
01:10:42,798 --> 01:10:45,400
You lose! Good day, sir.

1022
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,038
You're a cheat.

1023
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:50,740
How can you build up
a little boy's hopes

1024
01:10:50,806 --> 01:10:52,541
and then disappoint him like this.

1025
01:10:52,607 --> 01:10:54,777
I said, "Good day."

1026
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,886
Come on, Charlie, you've
still got your gobstopper.

1027
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:05,755
Once we find a way
to bring back Slugworth,

1028
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:07,422
he'll pay big money for it.

1029
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:33,182
And so shines
a good deed in a weary world.

1030
01:11:34,183 --> 01:11:35,217
Charlie?

1031
01:11:36,485 --> 01:11:38,087
My boy, you did it.

1032
01:11:38,153 --> 01:11:41,791
You won the contest.
I knew you would.

1033
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:43,225
Oh, Charlie, forgive me

1034
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:44,726
for putting you
and your friends through this.

1035
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:46,361
Forgive me, please, forgive me.

1036
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:48,663
Charlie, let me introduce
Mr. Wilkinson.

1037
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:49,999
Pleasure to meet you, Charlie.

1038
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:52,034
- Slugworth.
- No, this isn't Slugworth.

1039
01:11:52,101 --> 01:11:54,403
He's one of my workers.
He was only pretending.

1040
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:57,807
But you said you had a
master plan against Mr. Wonka.

1041
01:11:57,873 --> 01:11:59,241
No, my boy.

1042
01:11:59,308 --> 01:12:02,011
My master plan was
to help Wonka find an heir.

1043
01:12:02,077 --> 01:12:04,046
I was concerned
that you and Tom and Jerry

1044
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:05,514
would interfere with that plan.

1045
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,449
So, I had to try and stop you.

1046
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,051
Who knew?

1047
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:10,385
Oh, Charlie, I had to test you,

1048
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,955
and you passed with flying colors.

1049
01:12:13,022 --> 01:12:14,824
This is all so exciting.

1050
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:16,025
But we have to get going.

1051
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:18,427
So much time and so little to do.

1052
01:12:18,493 --> 01:12:20,229
Strike that. Reverse it.

1053
01:12:22,531 --> 01:12:23,732
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1054
01:12:23,799 --> 01:12:26,268
If you please, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.

1055
01:12:26,768 --> 01:12:28,370
Oh, Tuffy.

1056
01:12:28,437 --> 01:12:30,505
It looks like you've grown a lot.

1057
01:12:31,506 --> 01:12:32,607
Come on in...

1058
01:12:32,674 --> 01:12:34,209

01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:50,259
Wait, I was only doing my job.

1063
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,895
You know, I never liked that guy.

1064
01:12:52,962 --> 01:12:54,729
- How am I going to get home now?
- Hey, what did you do?

1065
01:12:54,796 --> 01:12:56,498
Don't put me on the drawer.

1066
01:12:56,565 --> 01:12:58,533
- It stinks in here.
- And it's dark too.

1067
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:14,449
The Great Glass Wonkavator.

1068
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:17,052
These buttons can
take us anywhere in the factory.

1069
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:18,854
Yes, and I've pressed them all,

1070
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:20,222
all except for one.

1071
01:13:21,623 --> 01:13:23,492
Go on, Charlie. Press it.

1072
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:27,029
Whoa!

1073
01:13:37,772 --> 01:13:39,975
Hey, there's our house.

1074
01:13:53,355 --> 01:13:56,091
So, Charlie,
how did you like my factory?

1075
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:58,527
Mr. Wonka, it's the most
wonderful place

1076
01:13:58,593 --> 01:14:00,095
in the whole wide world.

1077
01:14:00,162 --> 01:14:02,031
I'm happy to hear you say that.

1078
01:14:02,097 --> 01:14:03,933
- Because I'm giving it to you.
- Huh?

1079
01:14:03,999 --> 01:14:06,535
You're giving your factory to Charlie?

1080
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:07,702
Absolutely.

1081
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:09,238
You can move in immediately.

1082
01:14:09,304 --> 01:14:11,773
You and your entire family.
You can bring them all,

1083
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,243
even Tom and Jerry.

1084
01:14:14,309 --> 01:14:16,912
Wow, I still can't believe
this is happening.

1085
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:18,280
You know what happened to the boy

1086
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:20,916
who suddenly got
everything he ever wanted?

1087
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:22,151
What?

1088
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:24,386
He lived happily ever after.

1089
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:38,667
This is the only way to fly.

1090
01:14:38,733 --> 01:14:39,834
