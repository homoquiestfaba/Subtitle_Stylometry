1
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:36,215
Mr. Radford, good morning.

2
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:41,656
Well, l know it isn`t Grauman`s
Chinese theater, but here we are.

3
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:49,648
Mr. Radford...this film has been part
of your life for almost 4O years.

4
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,569
lt isn`t going to be easy to let go of it.

5
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:54,570
l`m here to help you
every step of the way.

6
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:08,938
Patrick, start the movie now.

7
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:11,054
- Right away Dr. Cashin.
- Bill,

8
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,288
l understand you`re
allowing Radford to see his film.

9
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,970
Uh, yes l am.

10
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,571
Are you sure that`s wise?

11
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:19,855
His obsessions have only grown
during his confinement here.

12
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:22,771
Showing the film might just
be the breakthrough he needs.

13
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,493
Crazy bastard.

14
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:31,490
- Hey, can l have a hand?
- Sure.

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,089
Radford`s film`s like an infection.

16
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:42,408
lt Taints his entire existence--

17
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:43,772
No offense Dave,

18
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:46,053
but you`re almost as obsessed
with that filmas he is.

19
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,369
Well maybe you could delay
it so l could observe.

20
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,449
Look, he`s already in the room.

21
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:53,768
l`d hate for him to be
transferred back at this point.

22
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,576
lt would only rile him up.

23
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:00,927
Well, l`ll get back as soon as l can and

24
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,896
then maybe you`ll allow me to
observe your follow up session.

25
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:06,446
lf you think it`s absolutely
necessary doctor.

26
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:11,093
Wayne, your ride is here.

27
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:15,656
Good luck.

28
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:17,417
Thanks.

29
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:57,975
Hello?

30
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,456
Hello?

31
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,094
Hello?

32
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,609
Oh my God!!

33
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,535
Rachael,

34
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,048
Rachael have you seen Kenny?

35
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,617
What`s up?

36
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:15,689
The CO2 line was kinked again.

37
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,530
Ok, thanks but you really need
to get back up there.

38
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,529
lt`s almost midnight,
you have to be taking the tickets.

39
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,690
Sure, but it`s not like there`s
going to be a crowd.

40
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:25,607
Why don`t we play something
good sometime?

41
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:27,290
l bet we could get a lot more
people to come...

42
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:29,209
if we had something they
actually heard of.

43
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,937
Well l totally agree with you,
but you know how Mr. Lambert is.

44
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:34,054
Yeah, Cheap.

45
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,928
Don`t worry hon, Harley don`t bite.

46
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,690
Not often anyway.

47
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,653
Yeah, how about after the movie
l take you on a ride around the block?

48
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,091
That`s ok, thank you.

49
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:03,089
This toothpick give you a hard on?

50
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:04,657
Testosterone Babe!

51
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,411
lt`s a natural order of the universe.

52
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,576
Not Bad.

53
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:21,414
l`ll take a large.

54
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,929
Sorry Timmy, l can`t let you in.

55
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,053
Why not?

56
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:40,491
lt`s theater policy.

57
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:43,888
No one under 18 allowed without
a parent or guardian after 1 1pm.

58
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,610
You`re not 18!

59
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,290
But l`m in charge.

60
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,334
No, you`re not.

61
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:53,296
Rachel! Can you find Bridget?

62
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,175
Timmy?

63
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,531
Why aren`t you at home?

64
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,815
Mrs. Kincade had to leave.
What was l supposed to do?

65
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:03,332
lt`s almost midnight.
You should have gone to bed.

66
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,172
l wasn`t tired, so l thought l could come
see the movie and go home with you.

67
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:08,930
No, not this time. You`ll get nightmares.

68
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,531
No, l won`t.

69
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:13,610
Don`t you remember what happened when
l let you watch Silence Of the Lambs?

70
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:16,572
- l remember.
- Hey, come on.

71
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:18,489
Maybe next time little buddy.

72
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,057
You still cool?

73
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,577
Sure sis.

74
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:25,375
Kenny, l`ll cover you here,
can you please take him home?

75
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,292
lt`s only 4 blocks Bridget, plus
what`s he gonna do with my bike?

76
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,209
Ok, fine, but you need
to go straight home.

77
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:32,572
- Yeah...
- And text me as soon as

78
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:34,330
you get there so l know that you`re ok.

79
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,215
Fine.

80
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:42,892
Hey, little man.

81
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:44,491
l`m not little.

82
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:46,773
C`mon, that`s not what l meant.

83
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,968
Okay so it looks like we`re going
to need more milk duds.

84
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,616
Hey there.

85
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:54,889
Hi, what are you doing here?

86
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:58,209
Well, l figured that if you couldn`t
come to me, l`d come to you.

87
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:01,049
l thought you had plans
with Mario tonight?

88
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:03,936
Yeah we did but you know
Samantha got off work early so

89
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,816
l convinced them
to come hang out here with us.

90
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:07,774
With us?

91
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,326
Josh l`m working, l cant sit and
watch a movie with you.

92
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:11,851
Sure you can.

93
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,212
Shouldn`t you be taking tickets?

94
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:15,050
Let me manage for you tonight.

95
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,887
lt`ll give me a chance to prove myself.

96
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:18,933
Perfect.

97
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:20,929
Uh, l don`t know.

98
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,929
You`ll still be in the theater
if anything goes wrong.

99
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,451
Exactly. Give the kid a shot.

100
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,530
- l really shouldn`t--
- C`mon.

101
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,450
So make sure that nothing...

102
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,529
- ...goes wrong.
- Yes!

103
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,895
l won`t let you down.

104
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:03,254
So this is going to be great.

105
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:10,287
So tell me, did you plan this date
night to lessen the blow?

106
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:12,252
What blow?

107
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,533
l saw the envelope on your desk.

108
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:20,936
You got in, didn`t you?

109
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:22,652
l don`t know.

110
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:23,853
You don`t know?

111
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,089
No l don`t. l haven`t even opened it yet.

112
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:29,772
C`mon Josh, you know you got in.

113
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,690
You mean l shouldn`t go?

114
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,450
Josh, of course l think you should go.

115
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:37,336
lt`s not that, l just don`t understand why
you have to go to a college in New York.

116
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,612
No, you could come with?

117
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,450
l can`t come with you l have Timmy.

118
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,573
There are schools in New York.

119
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:43,091
Things just started
to settle down for him,

120
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,373
l can`t just shake up his life
like that again.

121
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:56,416
You know a year ago l would have
jumped at the chance to get out of here.

122
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:57,851
Look Josh,
l don`t want to hold you back.

123
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:01,408
No, Bridget, that`s not,
that`s not what l`m trying to say.

124
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,293
l want you in my life.

125
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,650
All right and if that means
staying here then...

126
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:12,692
...then l`m gonna stay here.

127
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,417
How`d l get so lucky?

128
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:22,889
l`ve come to suck your blood.

129
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,252
Late as usual.

130
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:26,977
Sorry. Sam had to finish sucking
more than my blood.

131
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,491
Know what l mean?

132
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:29,931
- Hey!
- What?

133
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,610
l heard that!

134
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,689
Jeez come on baby!

135
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:35,689
You know l`d lick the soles of your shoes.

136
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:37,416
Please!

137
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,691
This place is a dump!

138
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,609
Mario!

139
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:42,813
l`m sorry.

140
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:45,651
lt`s fine. l don`t own the place,
l just work here.

141
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,008
And besides, can you think of a better
place to watch a horror flick?

142
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,850
Yeah, but there`s no stadium seating.

143
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:51,132
And the sound sucks.

144
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,936
All the better for an old movie.

145
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,769
You gotta be kidding me!
Black and white?

146
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,974
How scary can that be?

147
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,732
Detective Barrons.

148
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,730
You`re not at your desk.
You`re at the theater, aren`t you?

149
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:16,207
- l`m off the clock.
- lt`s not about the hours.

150
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:17,777
You got to let it go.

151
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:20,849
He`s still out there chief, l know it.

152
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,769
- l can feel it.
- No, he`s not.

153
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,291
He got killed just like the rest of them.

154
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:26,448
Radford is the key
to what happened there.

155
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,098
Look, there were more than
7O people in that ward.

156
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:30,531
Yeah well he was the only one
that was marked.

157
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,370
Yeah, l heard that story before.

158
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,087
Do yourself a favor.
Turn around and go home.

159
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:43,609
Well if it`s no fun l imagine we could
figure out something else to do.

160
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,848
Rude! What is with you tonight?

161
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,530
- l was joking!
- Go! Go sit with Josh!

162
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,290
- Baby!
- You know you want to.

163
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,448
Besides you guys will probably talk
the whole time anyways.

164
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,257
- You sure?
- Go!

165
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,617
Hey All.

166
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:01,091
Hey Sully!

167
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,214
Mind if l sit with you guys?

168
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,731
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead man.

169
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:06,853
Great!

170
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,849
Horror movies just aren`t
as much fun by yourself.

171
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:11,054
Really, they did a study.

172
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:12,134
Popcorn?

173
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:15,255
You know the concession girl said
this movie`s like 4O years old.

174
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,169
Yeah but it`s going to be good,

175
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,488
You know l heard they actually killed
people when they made the movie.

176
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:21,250
Bullshit, that`s just some urban myth.

177
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:23,806
No, it`s true. Ted Radford.

178
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:25,968
The guy that plays the killer...

179
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,889
used to be locked up out at New Haven.

180
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:29,570
That place has been closed
for like 5 years.

181
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,091
Yeah because there was a massacre.

182
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,487
Some cult broke in and killed
everyone in the place.

183
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,489
See l heard it was a mass escape.

184
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,536
Yeah, well no one really knows
but they never found any bodies.

185
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,086
Ok enough please you`re creeping us out.

186
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,372
The really scary thing is that Radford

187
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,655
was watching this very movie
when he was slaughtered.

188
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:48,047
lf that was true l think there`d be
some more people here, don`t you?

189
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,173
lt`s a cult film man.

190
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:52,170
Cult films don`t draw crowds,
that`s why they`re called cult films.

191
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,534
Here you go.

192
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:03,688
Kenny.

193
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:06,850
What? l`ve got to start the movie.

194
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:12,208
Sorry, it`s eight dollars.

195
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,969
ls your manager around?

196
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:17,572
l`m in charge. Can l help you?

197
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,090
Have you seen this guy?

198
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:21,531
ls he wanted or something?

199
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,654
Yeah, something like that.

200
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,048
lf you see him, you just let him in,

201
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,049
and then you come get me.
l`ll be in the back row.

202
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:29,888
Sure.

203
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,969
- lt`s important.
- Yeah, l got it.

204
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,014
Kenny.

205
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,415
l gotta go.

206
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,571
Okay. Flip on the sound system.

207
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:58,133
Check.

208
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,692
All right. Run the film.

209
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:52,654
No, lt`s right by that rainbow.

210
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:53,932
What?

211
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:59,536
You`re missing it. lt`s right there.

212
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:02,007
Woodstock`s in New York.

213
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,328
We haven`t even left California yet.

214
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,090
Are you sure about that?

215
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:08,009
Yeah, where are we Bobby?

216
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,168
We were supposed
to hit the interstate by now.

217
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:14,649
- l know. l think--
- Look, there`s a leprechaun.

218
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:17,775
Stop the van. l want to dance with him.

219
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,371
Give me a break.

220
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,891
You should give her a break Bobby.

221
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:23,367
That`s strong stuff you gave her.

222
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:25,808
How was l supposed to know
she`d do it all at once?

223
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:28,366
Well she did and now you got
to deal with it.

224
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,777
You tell him, girl.

225
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:33,256
How`d that loser get three girls
all to himself?

226
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,215
Only in a movie, man.

227
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:40,457
Woe, woe, woe...what the hell was that?

228
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:46,813
ls everyone all right?

229
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:47,967
- Yeah.
- What d`ya hit?

230
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,650
- Nothing.
- Sure.

231
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:53,731
Kind of a weak set up.
Here`s where the fun starts.

232
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,729
l swear. l didn`t hit a thing.

233
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,774
l think it was the front tire.

234
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:10,927
Oh man, we got no spare.

235
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:12,212
What?

236
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:14,892
How do you think
l got the weed for Joel`s party.

237
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,694
- You knew l didn`t have the money.
- You idiot.

238
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,416
Now what`re we gonna do?

239
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:26,054
We passed a house a little ways back.
Maybe they have a phone we can use.

240
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:28,857
Well, You best get walking then.

241
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,293
Five bucks says the blond gets naked.

242
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,889
What? lt`s a horror movie.

243
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:35,252
Somebody always gets naked.

244
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:37,056
And then they die.

245
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:40,815
l say it`s the black chick.

246
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,171
With our luck, it`s probably
the dog with the glasses.

247
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,848
You didn`t mind the trade when
we were baked out of our gourds.

248
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,414
Did ya, Monica?

249
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:01,093
- What, l can`t eat?
- Dude, you`re making us all sick.

250
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,615
Hello.

251
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:01,009
Oh, man..

252
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:04,488
Something tells me that you`re lost.

253
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:07,695
l bet you could use something to drink.

254
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,370
Uh..Okay.

255
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,652
l wouldn`t go in there if l was him.

256
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,535
What kind of movie would you have then?

257
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,932
l don`t see him anymore.

258
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,606
That house must have been pretty far.

259
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:27,814
Just be glad that he`s the one
walkin` then.

260
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,571
Cause it`s hot.

261
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:33,013
Taking that shirt off is one way
to cool down.

262
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:36,054
Can it college kids.

263
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,853
You`re ruining the mood.

264
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,811
Uh...Do you think they`ll be long?

265
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,816
Who`s that dear?

266
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:05,137
The garage with the tire.

267
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,211
No, they won`t be long.

268
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,448
Your obsession is starting to worry me.

269
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,449
- You`re late Dave.
- Sorry.

270
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,096
Asshole.

271
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:56,329
Well, the least you could have
done was get us some popcorn.

272
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:11,448
You really think he`s gonna show?

273
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:15,015
This is the first screening of his
movie since he disappeared.

274
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,373
lf he`s out there, he`ll show.

275
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:23,769
Guys at the station...
all think l`m crazy.

276
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,289
Even the new recruits don`t
want to ride with me.

277
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:27,652
Tell me about it.

278
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:31,208
lf the board knew l was here,
l`d probably be fired.

279
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:35,533
l`m starting to think that they
might be right.

280
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,608
Yeah except you and l were there Doug.

281
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:40,495
They weren`t.

282
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,734
Ma`am?

283
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:04,174
Are you okay?

284
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:17,172
Ma`am?

285
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,610
Mario.

286
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:06,333
Duty calls.

287
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:18,888
You and l both now that Radford
is the key to everything.

288
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,534
All we have to do
is figure out how he did it.

289
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,253
lt`s been five years.

290
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:25,693
l don`t..l don`t know that we can.

291
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:30,656
Outside of the supernatural,
nothing makes any sense.

292
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:34,934
lf he doesn`t show, we may have
to resign ourselves to the fact that

293
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:37,293
we`ll never know what happened there.

294
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:42,897
Hey, could l give you
a ride home tonight?

295
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:45,853
My boyfriend`s picking me up.

296
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,732
You could call him and
tell him not to bother.

297
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:53,610
Yeah, dumb idea.

298
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,375
Syrup`s out.

299
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,048
lt`s not my job to change it,
l`m management now.

300
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:06,175
l hate it down there.

301
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:12,249
Could you do it for me? Please...

302
00:23:13,898 --> 00:23:15,809
lf you let me take you home.

303
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:19,857
No. But l will let you see my new tattoo.

304
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:21,857
Where is it?

305
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:26,087
Let`s just say that l can`t show you here.

306
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:33,055
- What`s wrong?
- l wanna leave.

307
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,614
Why?

308
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:35,733
l just want to go.

309
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,729
Just come find me in the office
when it`s over.

310
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,774
Come on, it just started to get good.

311
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,174
Hey, hey Bridget.

312
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:49,610
- What`s going on?
- l don`t know.

313
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,689
Um...l`m just.

314
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:54,292
l don`t know, l just,
l don`t want to watch the rest.

315
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:55,891
Why?

316
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:58,367
Did you see that lady`s arm?

317
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,972
lt`s just hitting a little close
to home, Ok?

318
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:04,368
l`m sorry. Come here.

319
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,733
l just don`t feel safe in there.

320
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:17,257
Bridget, your Dad`s not here.

321
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:20,371
Alright? He`s only up here.

322
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,087
And you and your brother
are safe now...

323
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:27,487
`cause l promise
l`m not gonna let anyone...

324
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:32,606
hurt either of you
ever again. All right?

325
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,735
Jackie, you should get out of the sun.

326
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,013
She`s fine.

327
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,969
Was that a car?

328
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:49,174
Let`s hope it was someone
with a new tire.

329
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:34,770
That tattoo better be damn good.

330
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:40,533
Here comes another one.

331
00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:59,131
This guys a goner.

332
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,290
Whenever they switch to a POV
like that, they`re dead for sure.

333
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:04,729
- What?
- Who is he?

334
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:08,128
l don`t know.
The guy with the tire, l guess.

335
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,369
You`re in trouble now, buddy.

336
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,654
Please, let me go.

337
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:30,771
He looks familiar.

338
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,894
What other movies has that kid been in?

339
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:36,091
No! Stop! Please!

340
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,574
This is awesome!

341
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:44,849
There`s not that much blood.

342
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:47,736
lt`s only the second kill.
lt`ll get bloodier.

343
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:49,615
lt always does.

344
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:01,809
Come on baby, it`s not that bad.

345
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,968
Speak for yourself. This is freaky.

346
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,447
You know...They say that scary
movies are anaphrodisiac.

347
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,689
lf you get turned on by this,
we`re breaking up.

348
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:13,407
l just don`t understand why you
want to watch that kind of thing.

349
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:15,011
You saw somebody actually doing that.

350
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:17,009
Exactly! lt`s not real.

351
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:19,009
lt`s just a thrill, you know?

352
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:22,135
lt gets your heart racing.
You face your fears.

353
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:24,937
Yeah, well, l guess it`s just
different for me then.

354
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:27,054
No, no it`s not.

355
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:30,935
Look, everybody likes to get
scared every once in a while.

356
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:36,411
Even you.
Think of it as a roller coaster.

357
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:38,370
Come on, you love those.

358
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,813
- Yeah.
- See see. lt`s the same thing.

359
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,968
l mean yeah, yeah they`re scary but...

360
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:44,931
they`re safe.

361
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:47,248
Even roller coasters crash sometimes.

362
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,931
All right, all right, you win.

363
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,532
But will you come back inside for me?

364
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:57,332
You can let go, be scared. lt`s okay.

365
00:28:57,698 --> 00:29:01,691
Plus, l mean l like it when you`re scared.

366
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:04,372
You uh, you grab on to me.

367
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,732
You make me feel important. Please?

368
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,176
Okay.

369
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:36,291
Jesus, was that you?

370
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,454
Sorry.

371
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:41,411
God that reeks!

372
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:45,457
Why do you think he was at Newhaven?

373
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:47,051
By the time we got him,

374
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:51,051
he had abandoned
his own identity altogether.

375
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:55,017
He actually thought that
he was the killer from the film.

376
00:29:55,698 --> 00:30:00,613
Do you think what happened was
his way to immortalize his movie?

377
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:05,647
No. Radford was a man
obsessed with scaring people.

378
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:10,766
The movie was just a vehicle for him
to act out his own depraved fantasies.

379
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,816
Jeez, l thought that was
supposed to be cathartic.

380
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:17,527
ln Radford`s case it only
increased his taste for it.

381
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:28,336
Dude!

382
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:34,257
Damn scrumptious,
chocolate covered raisins.

383
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:43,767
Damn. Should have gotten the jumbo.

384
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,172
Where is that boy?

385
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:49,374
Something`s wrong.
He`s been gone too long.

386
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,176
You got that right.

387
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:54,370
You stay here with Jackie.
l`m going to figure out what`s going on.

388
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,894
Shit!

389
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:01,814
Hey, this isn`t funny.

390
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:11,452
Mario, if this is you,
l`m gonna kick your ass!

391
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:12,937
Come on!

392
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:24,894
What`s going on?

393
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:26,730
Why does the picture keep doing that?

394
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:29,173
This film is so old,
they`re lucky it`s even playing.

395
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,532
Where is this?

396
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:42,937
l don`t know.

397
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,014
What the hell?

398
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,451
What?

399
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:49,096
That was Sully.

400
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,133
Hello?

401
00:32:51,218 --> 00:32:52,571
The prank of all pranks.

402
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:55,252
- That`s Sully up there!
- Yeah, yeah, l know.

403
00:32:55,778 --> 00:32:56,813
Mario?

404
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:58,172
He just said my name!

405
00:32:58,258 --> 00:32:59,293
This is fantastic!

406
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,494
l didn`t know the dork had it in him.

407
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:04,653
This isn`t funny.

408
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:06,057
lt is for us!

409
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,373
How`s he doing that?

410
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,050
He was president of the A/ Vclub.

411
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:14,935
God, he`s freaking me out.

412
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:25,532
Fuckin brilliant!

413
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:28,655
Hey! Will you guys keep it down.

414
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:30,410
lt`s not even the movie,
it`s our friend up there.

415
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:32,011
How the hell did he pull this off?

416
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:34,453
- Let`s go see.
- No, no, no, wait, there`s more. Look.

417
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:40,089
Sully, you`re brilliant!

418
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:42,487
lf you guys don`t shut up,
l`m gonna kick your ass.

419
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:44,057
Fuck you!

420
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:46,648
- l got, l got your back.
- Easy fellas.

421
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,410
Hey, butt out porker.

422
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:50,932
Worth a night in jail to you?

423
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:52,890
Sit down and relax.

424
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:56,332
You guys just keep quiet
and watch the movie.

425
00:33:57,418 --> 00:34:00,091
Kenny, is that you?

426
00:34:10,018 --> 00:34:11,337
Oh my God.

427
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:13,688
Yes, yes, he`s with my son.

428
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:17,487
Why don`t you come in and cool off.

429
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:23,050
See, he`s doing it again.

430
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:24,856
That`s it you little punk.

431
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:26,571
Josh, no.

432
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,137
- You want some?
- Guys, stop it.

433
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,778
- He`s telling the truth. That`s the lobby.
- Of this theater!

434
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,166
Hello? Hello?

435
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,813
How`s he doing that?

436
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:38,456
l don`t know, let`s go see.

437
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:45,210
Dude, check it out.

438
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:46,890
Aw, Sully, we know it`s you.

439
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:48,252
Where`d he go?

440
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,294
Bathroom.

441
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:06,054
Oh, shit.

442
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:22,249
That`s it. We`re out of here.

443
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:23,373
lt`s not real.

444
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,096
No shit.

445
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:27,254
Where are the cameras?

446
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:30,609
l`m not gonna look like a fool
on some reality show.

447
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:33,128
We`re getting punked you nitwits!

448
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,937
Sweet!

449
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:39,488
Fuck you, l didn`t sign any release!

450
00:35:39,698 --> 00:35:42,087
Hey, l need everyone out of the theater.

451
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:43,611
Why?

452
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:45,051
This answer your question?

453
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:47,447
Oh great, he`s in on it too.

454
00:35:47,538 --> 00:35:49,051
This ain`t no TV show.

455
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:50,412
l need you to do what l`m telling you.

456
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:51,692
ls that a real badge.

457
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:53,928
Hey, son. You want me to spell it out for you?

458
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,009
That`s real blood you`re standing in.

459
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:57,133
Wait a minute...

460
00:35:57,218 --> 00:35:59,732
Are you saying that Sully`s really dead?

461
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,256
Freeze!

462
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,336
Look familiar?

463
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:09,132
How`s it feel to be right?

464
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:10,412
l wish we were wrong.

465
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:11,453
Where did his body go?

466
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:13,210
Probably dragged him off
to chop him up or something.

467
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:13,650
Dude.

468
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,171
What? lt`s what you were
thinking anyway, isn`t it?

469
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,293
Did you have to say it?

470
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:17,970
lt`s not like Sully was a good friend
of mine or anything.

471
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:19,093
You`re unbelievable.

472
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,691
There`s someone in there!

473
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,575
l saw him! He was right there!

474
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,126
Freeze!

475
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,053
Shit.

476
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:37,493
Come on kid, get up.

477
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,814
Timmy!

478
00:36:41,138 --> 00:36:42,810
What are you doing here?

479
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,490
l can`t believe Kenny let you back in.

480
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,728
l got in through your office window.

481
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:48,536
Come on.

482
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:53,574
Yep, it`s locked.

483
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:58,090
Yeah, l tried that one too.

484
00:36:58,178 --> 00:36:59,736
Great. So we can`t get out.

485
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,092
You got it sister.

486
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,294
Does anyone have
a cell phone that works?

487
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:08,688
l don`t have any bars,
but it worked before.

488
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:10,336
There are emergency exits.

489
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:16,447
- Shit.
- Wait, we`re trapped in here?

490
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:19,291
We`ll be okay.
We just need to stick together.

491
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,967
A single assailant rarely attacks a group.

492
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:24,174
So what do we do, just, just sit here.

493
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:26,133
Everyone back to the lobby.

494
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:28,652
Move! Come on.

495
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:33,411
l`m so sorry.

496
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,250
l really thought the lid was on tight.

497
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,533
lt`s alright.

498
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:41,087
Again, l`m terribly sorry.

499
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,214
Thanks.

500
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,134
Stay with us.

501
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,968
Detective, how do you know
there`s only one killer?

502
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:16,012
Everyone quick, come here.
Gather round, all right.

503
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:18,692
There`s something l need
to explain to you.

504
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:22,009
Five years ago,
in a psych ward in Newhaven...

505
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:51,807
l can`t believe you two assholes
came here looking for a killer...

506
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:53,570
and you didn`t arn anybody.

507
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:55,569
We had no way of knowing
this was going to happen.

508
00:38:55,658 --> 00:38:56,886
Where`s my brother?

509
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,697
Timmy!

510
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:02,053
Freeze Radford!

511
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:03,412
You move, l will shoot you.

512
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:04,897
Mr. Radford, it`s me.

513
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:07,250
Everything`s going to be okay.

514
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,771
You`re going to be fine.

515
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:10,257
Just do what the officer says.

516
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,970
Let him go, Now!

517
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:15,572
Put the weapon down. Do it now!

518
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:24,935
Dave?

519
00:39:33,778 --> 00:39:34,733
They`re gone.

520
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:36,092
What the hell is going on?

521
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:38,897
l hit him. l know l hit him.

522
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:40,013
l definitely hit him.

523
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:41,531
He must have been wearing
a bulletproof vest. Right?

524
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:42,812
Yeah, you should have
shot him in the head.

525
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:43,933
- Hey, l hit him!
- Bullshit!

526
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:45,292
- Hey, l hit him!
- Where`s the body?

527
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:49,929
Look, it`s the killer from the fucking
movie and he`s here in this theater.

528
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,698
What we need to do is keep our
god darn heads.

529
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:55,770
What we need to do is get
the fuck out of here.

530
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:58,895
You`re right. Come on.

531
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,731
l told you, it`s the killer
from the movie and

532
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,207
he obviously doesn`t want us getting out.

533
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,731
l didn`t close the window when l got in.

534
00:40:23,818 --> 00:40:25,171
So it`s probably still open.

535
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:26,134
What window?

536
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,492
The one in the upstairs office?

537
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:28,852
Let`s go for it!

538
00:40:28,938 --> 00:40:30,451
l`m not wandering around this place.

539
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:31,653
Well we`re not safe here.

540
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:33,012
Well l`m not fumbling around
in the dark.

541
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,850
Well then go sit on your ass
while we get out of here.

542
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:38,328
Mario, chill, she`s scared.
We`re all scared.

543
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,212
We`ll get out of this.

544
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:42,653
As long as we don`t turn
on each other. Okay?

545
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,571
l`m afraid of heights.

546
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:46,613
Well are you afraid
of getting stabbed to death?

547
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:47,733
Cause that`s the alternative.

548
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:50,127
Look, anyone who can`t get out
has to hope for the best.

549
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:53,608
- l`m getting the hell out of here.
- Just wait, wait.

550
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:55,370
Whatever the killer sees,
that`s what`s on the screen, right?

551
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,016
- lt`s his point of view?
- So?

552
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:59,134
So, can`t we use that against him?

553
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:01,488
That`s good. That`s a great idea.

554
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,046
l`ll stay back and keep a lookout.

555
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:05,093
lf he comes back, l can warn you.

556
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:06,691
- Why you?
- Because if he attacks again,

557
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:09,656
- you`re going to need his gun.
- Yeah, lot of good that did last time.

558
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:12,013
- You got something better?
- Josh.

559
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,051
Just go with them.

560
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,571
l don`t want you to stay here.

561
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:18,047
l told you...No one`s gonna
hurt you while l`m around.

562
00:41:18,138 --> 00:41:19,730
Fine. Whatever. Stay.

563
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:21,695
Could the rest of us get
the fuck out of here?

564
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:56,050
Come on, girl. Let`s go join the party.

565
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,855
Jackie, get up.

566
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,967
Wheeeee!

567
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:05,697
lf you don`t get up,
l`m leaving you here.

568
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:16,247
What is it Har?

569
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:18,533
lf we keep going, we won`t hear him.

570
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:19,853
Look, you guys keep going.

571
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,894
l`m gonna stay here and relay.

572
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:23,931
What are you doing Babe?
Go with them.

573
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:25,371
l`m not leaving you.

574
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,369
Babe, l`ll be fine.

575
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,892
You know better than to argue with me.

576
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:33,735
- Get going.
- Yeah!

577
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:38,936
We`re gonna be okay.

578
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:43,214
Hey, have l ever failed
to get us out of a jam before?

579
00:42:43,298 --> 00:42:44,856
There was Boston.

580
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,931
Boston wasn`t a jam,
that was a helluva party.

581
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:56,010
Babe, we`re gonna be okay.

582
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:07,653
What was that?

583
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:11,287
Babe, it was nothing. You gotta relax.

584
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:13,216
l`m trying.

585
00:43:32,178 --> 00:43:33,850
He`s in the hallway!

586
00:43:33,938 --> 00:43:35,576
He`s coming!

587
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:37,576
He`s coming!

588
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,813
l don`t think they can hear me from here.

589
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:46,891
Oh, shit!

590
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:49,617
Come on, boy! Bring it!

591
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:50,972
- Harley, no!
- Come on, man.

592
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:52,933
Run!

593
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,331
What are you waiting for, let`s go!

594
00:43:56,418 --> 00:43:59,569
- What the fuck?
- Come on girls, go, go.

595
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:03,254
lt`s all right. We`re fine. Go on out.

596
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:12,971
lt won`t open!

597
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,776
Go, get outta here!

598
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:22,809
l can`t get them out!

599
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:37,373
Mario!

600
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,089
You want her, huh?

601
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:45,533
You gotta go through me first.

602
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:28,896
Oh...you`ve brought another
friend home.

603
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:44,886
Holy shit, l barely got out of there!

604
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,454
You yellow piece of shit.
We saw what you did.

605
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:58,608
Hey, hey,hey. What are you doing?

606
00:46:58,698 --> 00:47:00,928
This motherfucker left his
girlfriend up there to die.

607
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,417
- So you`re just going to kill him?
- Yup.

608
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:04,170
You saw what he did to her.

609
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:07,694
Hey. No matter what you do to Mario,
that thing is still gonna come after us.

610
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:11,134
But we`ll all feel better if l put
a knife through this piece of trash.

611
00:47:11,218 --> 00:47:13,254
Nobody deserves that.

612
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,693
You had a hard-ass too, huh.

613
00:47:22,658 --> 00:47:25,809
When our Mom died,
our Dad took it out on us.

614
00:47:41,178 --> 00:47:42,816
Hey look!

615
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:51,575
What the hell is he waiting for?

616
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:56,258
Hey dickhead, we`re right here.

617
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:02,648
l cannot believe l`m wanting
to get a cop`s attention.

618
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:14,814
What the hell?

619
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:16,854
We`re right in front of your face!

620
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:22,328
The killer doesn`t want him to see us.

621
00:48:22,418 --> 00:48:25,649
Open the door,come on, open the door.

622
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:36,649
lt`s all locked up.
Are you sure this is the place?

623
00:48:36,738 --> 00:48:38,012
Stand by.

624
00:48:38,098 --> 00:48:40,054
That is correct. Avenue Theater.

625
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,931
Well it looks like the party`s over.

626
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:45,169
Barrons ain`t here. No one is.

627
00:48:49,778 --> 00:48:51,734
No!

628
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:53,771
Miserable pig!

629
00:48:53,858 --> 00:48:56,418
My bike is right there,
right fuckin` there!

630
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:59,296
lt might as well be on another planet
for all the good it`ll do you.

631
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:01,334
Look, we can`t count on anybody
coming to the rescue.

632
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:02,533
lt`s up to us.

633
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:04,370
We`re just going to die like
the others, aren`t we?

634
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:05,971
lf we give up, that`s exactly
what`ll happen.

635
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:08,856
OK. So what are we gonna do?

636
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:10,371
We`re going to find a way to stop him.

637
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,652
What are we supposed to do to him?

638
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:13,410
You guys, what we`re up against
doesn`t make any sense.

639
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:16,490
lt`s totally messed up, okay,
you need to start thinking like that.

640
00:49:16,618 --> 00:49:17,971
What would they do in the movie?

641
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:18,934
Oh, right, that`ll work.

642
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:20,212
That`s it! The projector.

643
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:22,414
We just stop the movie.

644
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:24,976
Out of the way.

645
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:27,892
lt`s locked.
Just like all the other doors.

646
00:49:27,978 --> 00:49:29,536
What about the projection window?

647
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:31,254
Timmy could fit.

648
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:32,896
lt`s too high.

649
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:37,895
Okay, you guys start pounding this door
and don`t stop until l say so, okay?

650
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:38,933
Sure.

651
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:39,689
You know it`s not going to open.

652
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:42,292
- Why are we---
- Cause she said so!

653
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:44,489
Shut up, Mario.

654
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:49,251
You can do this, okay?

655
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:50,373
l won`t know the way.

656
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,574
You`re just going to listen for Harley,
he`s banging on the door.

657
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:54,614
Ok? Come on.

658
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,094
Here.

659
00:50:23,058 --> 00:50:26,289
- Bridget?
- You`re okay, keep going.

660
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,574
Come on Timmy!

661
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:01,016
Timmy go!

662
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:07,254
What are you doing? l`m right here!

663
00:52:07,698 --> 00:52:09,336
Come on, come on l`m right here!

664
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:22,293
Timmy open the door!

665
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:44,210
We did it! We got the son of a bitch.

666
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:51,172
Good work, little man.

667
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:57,413
Gotcha motherfucker.

668
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:10,207
Go, go, go!

669
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:11,253
Timmy!

670
00:53:41,378 --> 00:53:42,572
Are you okay?

671
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:44,410
He don`t like small spaces.

672
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:46,689
Because you`re so big?

673
00:53:46,778 --> 00:53:48,257
Cause l can`t breathe.

674
00:53:58,058 --> 00:53:59,571
He`s gonna hear you.

675
00:53:59,938 --> 00:54:01,656
That ain`t helping.

676
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:35,256
- l swear l heard a scream.
- What are we going to do about it?

677
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,612
lt`s every man for himself now.

678
00:54:36,698 --> 00:54:39,770
Hey, l`ll remember that
when he`s coming after you.

679
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:54,251
Hey, where is everyone?

680
00:54:59,898 --> 00:55:02,617
The POV is gone.
He must be back in the movie.

681
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:05,690
- Why did l let Timmy go with them?
- Because you`d be dead if you didn`t.

682
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:13,850
l smell fear.

683
00:55:16,138 --> 00:55:20,177
Yes. There`s a girl out there.

684
00:55:21,178 --> 00:55:24,170
lt`s not her.

685
00:55:28,778 --> 00:55:33,898
That`s it. That`s how he does it.

686
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:36,014
He feel when we`re afraid.

687
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:41,614
Bridget, can you tell where that is?

688
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:21,767
Come on!

689
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:24,292
While he`s busy with her,
we can try the window again.

690
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:26,209
lt`s not going to open.

691
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:28,892
Josh, we need to find my brother.

692
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:34,094
Get out of my way, kid.

693
00:57:36,378 --> 00:57:39,370
Oh please, l don`t want to die.

694
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,732
Timmy!....

695
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:13,615
Timmy!

696
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:24,734
We`re going to make it out of here.

697
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,732
- l shouldn`t have let him go.
- No..no no no. Bridget,

698
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:32,128
we`re going to find Timmy....

699
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,575
Wait here.

700
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:56,608
Bring it on you son of a bitch, bring it on!

701
00:58:57,218 --> 00:58:58,936
l got your number pal.

702
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:06,373
That`s right!

703
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:14,617
Bridget!

704
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:10,770
l can do this. l can do this.

705
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:20,613
l can do this.

706
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:41,094
Timmy?

707
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:54,571
Timmy!

708
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:56,734
Oh my God!

709
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:01,215
Where`s Josh?

710
01:01:02,778 --> 01:01:04,336
lt`s just us now.

711
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:07,053
Listen to me. Sit down.

712
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:09,969
You can`t be afraid, okay?

713
01:01:10,058 --> 01:01:11,173
That`s a weakness.

714
01:01:11,258 --> 01:01:14,170
He can`t hurt you if you`re not afraid.

715
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:17,816
You remember the secret place
where Dad could never hurt you?

716
01:01:17,898 --> 01:01:19,809
The 2OO3 Cubs.

717
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:21,013
That`s where you go.

718
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:24,613
Okay? So say it with me...
Sammy Sosa...

719
01:01:24,698 --> 01:01:25,892
Sammy Sosa.

720
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,775
Good, go on.

721
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:30,333
Kerry Wood.

722
01:01:32,778 --> 01:01:34,655
Mark Prior.

723
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:37,851
The Lord is my shepherd;  l shall not want.

724
01:01:37,938 --> 01:01:40,691
Carlos Zambrano.

725
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:45,007
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

726
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:54,130
He leadeth me besides the still waters.

727
01:01:59,378 --> 01:02:01,733
Moises Alou.

728
01:02:05,618 --> 01:02:08,371
He restoreth my soul.

729
01:02:13,378 --> 01:02:15,733
Troy O`Leary.

730
01:02:22,658 --> 01:02:26,128
He leadeth me
to the path of righteousness...

731
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:30,775
Hello?

732
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:35,012
ls there anybody out there?

733
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:38,373
Can somebody please help me?

734
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:14,617
Help....us...

735
01:05:18,658 --> 01:05:20,774
l can`t get in.

736
01:06:48,778 --> 01:06:50,530
Oh my God!

737
01:06:51,858 --> 01:06:53,974
l can`t believe you`re alive.

738
01:06:57,058 --> 01:06:59,856
Bridget, you gotta...you gotta
get out of here while you still can.

739
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:01,087
What are you talking about?
You have to-

740
01:07:01,178 --> 01:07:07,094
Bridget, look at yourself.

741
01:07:09,538 --> 01:07:12,211
We`re all like this.

742
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:17,416
We should be dead,
but for some reason none of us are.

743
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:41,648
l thought you`d never wake up.

744
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:54,096
l`m going to take my time with you.

745
01:07:56,538 --> 01:08:01,612
Yes...l`d rather you be able to scream.

746
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:06,577
There`s nothing that you can do
to me that hasn`t been done already.

747
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:16,654
What your Daddy did is nothing compared
to what l have in store for you.

748
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:33,936
You`re gonna wish you could die.

749
01:09:27,218 --> 01:09:29,812
As l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

750
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:32,412
l will fear no evil.

751
01:09:57,898 --> 01:09:59,251
Timmy, wake up.

752
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:01,135
Come on. Wake up!

753
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:08,894
No!

754
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:33,293
Bridget!

755
01:11:39,218 --> 01:11:41,049
His story`s bullshit and you know it.

756
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:42,332
Of course it is.

757
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:44,488
The kid saw something tonight
that has him scared to death,

758
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:46,853
so sure he makes up
a story to deal with it.

759
01:11:46,978 --> 01:11:49,367
We ran the serial on it. lt`s his.

760
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,892
Okay. Put out an APB on Barrons.

761
01:11:56,218 --> 01:11:57,617
What do you want me to do with this?

762
01:11:57,698 --> 01:11:59,256
Tag it.

763
01:12:01,858 --> 01:12:02,813
Well, don`t worry.

764
01:12:02,898 --> 01:12:06,447
He`ll tell us what really happened
...eventually.
