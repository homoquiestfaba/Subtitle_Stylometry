1
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,361
(car tires screech)

2
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,296
Hello, baby.

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,597
How are you doing?

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,631
Hello, baby.

5
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,034
How are you doing?

6
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,035
Hello, baby.

7
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,635
How are you doing?

8
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,504
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba,
ba, ba, bop.

9
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,508
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,811
(lips trilling)

11
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:45,055
Everyone's trying to
keep me down.

12
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm like yeast, I rise.

13
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,783
And I am back, baby.

14
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,985
I'm back in the saddle
and it feels damn good.

15
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,354
Mother Dunkers,
the classic dunk heads.

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,790
I'm working some new hellos.

17
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,558
You Dunk fanatics out there,
welcome back.

18
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,927
What's up, guys?

19
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,437
I'm here.
I do not see him at the moment.

20
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,865
I've got the chat logs
right here.

21
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:04,966
Take a look at that,

22
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,334
where she says she's underage.

23
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,435
"Come meet me here."

24
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,512
He says, "I want to meet you.

25
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,570
"Can you send a pic?"

26
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,708
Exhibit A, exhibit B, exhibit D.

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,642
The wiener dog.

28
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,054
If he is like, oh, "I don't
know what you're talking about.

29
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,354
"I'm totally not here
for the thing

30
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,881
"that I'm obviously here for",

31
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,348
I'm gonna be like, "Boom!".

32
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,625
How come I got a picture
of your di-?

33
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,385
I got my handy dandy
spy glasses,

34
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,587
looking like a sexy nerd.

35
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,790
Boom, take off the glasses.

36
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:29,689
What's up, baby?

37
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:30,624
How are you doing?

38
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,726
Oh, I'm pretty late.

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,803
I hope this guy is still here.

40
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,561
Hang in there, Mr. Predator.

41
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,730
I'm coming to get ya.

42
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,631
Where the fuck are you?

43
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,534
(audio speeds up)

44
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:44,005
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think I see him.

45
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,106
Say, hello.

46
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,908
Hello, Mr. Pedophile.

47
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,375
Hello?

48
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,811
I see you.

49
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,344
I'm gonna get you.

50
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,980
You only have a couple
more seconds

51
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:54,916
of thinking you're gonna
meet with Julia.

52
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,883
Drum roll, please.

53
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,752
Let's dominate.

54
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,688
Hey, buddy!

55
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:02,757
How you doing, man?

56
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:04,657
Don't you remember me?

57
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,460
Come on, I'll give you one
guess to guess.

58
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,395
It's me.

59
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,429
It's me, stop, stop.

60
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,564
It's me, Julia.

61
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,869
Look, remember you sent me this?

62
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,546
Do you recognize the
person in this picture?

63
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,405
No.

64
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,717
[Benny] Really, because I
think that looks a lot like you,

65
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,044
like, you just sent a photo
of yourself

66
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,477
to a 13-year-old girl.

67
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,080
Yeah, it's not.

68
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,891
What are you here for?
- [Benny] What am I here for?

69
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,817
What are you here for?

70
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,519
I don't, I dunno, man.

71
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,754
[Benny] A dead ringer.

72
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,755
That's you.

73
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,760
Sit inside.

74
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,963
[Benny] You want me
to sit inside your car?

75
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,506
Why, are you getting a
little chilly out here?

76
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,530
Okay, Tim.

77
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,904
Wait, it's kind of weird now
that I know your name is Tim.

78
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:50,938
Isn't it, Tim?

79
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,573
Like, how do I know that?

80
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:55,877
You all right?

81
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,910
You look a little upset.

82
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,412
I get it.

83
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,815
You must be pretty bummed

84
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,415
that Julia doesn't actually
even exist.

85
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,618
Who?

86
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,053
- Who?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,055
[Benny] Are you gonna play
dumb with me?

88
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:08,923
I'll enlighten you.

89
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:09,857
You know what?

90
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:10,958
I'll enlighten you.

91
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,827
I'm talking about Julia.

92
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,062
The girl you've been talking
to for the past two months,

93
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,163
every single day.

94
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,732
The 13-year-old girl,

95
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,767
you were coming here to
have sex with.

96
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,434
That Julia.

97
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,037
Does that ring a bell?

98
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,773
You know the glasses on my
head have a camera, right?

99
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,041
Yeah.

100
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,118
[Benny] Right there on
the bridge.

101
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,676
Yeah, I can see it, yeah.

102
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,611
[Benny] Oh, okay, yeah,
you can see it?

103
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,190
It's okay, you probably have
like a brain tumor or something

104
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,925
that makes you wanna have
sex with little kids, right?

105
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,525
It like rubs up against a
certain part of your brain

106
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,895
and it makes you attracted
to young kids.

107
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,996
Is that what's wrong with you?

108
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,054
No.

109
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,521
[Benny] No, that's not?

110
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,125
No.

111
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,202
[Benny] So are you
just here to like what,

112
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,693
teach little girls a lesson

113
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,047
about talking to older
men online?

114
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,697
No.

115
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,999
[Benny] Well then talk to me.

116
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,000
There's some pretty sick
stuff in here.

117
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,601
You want me to read it?

118
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,905
You talk about licking cum
off the floor

119
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,540
and I mean,
it's stuff you wrote, so.

120
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,046
Do you think I'm stupid?

121
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,481
Do I know you're from somewhere?

122
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,850
[Benny] No, definitely not.

123
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:12,119
We do not run in the same
crowds.

124
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,687
Is your name Benny Jansen?

125
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,456
(pensive pitch)

126
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,169
Yeah, we went to high
school together.

127
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,995
You're the basketball
guy, right?

128
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,562
- No.
- Yeah.

129
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,098
- No.
- I was a mascot.

130
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,598
Let's focus on you.

131
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,767
Butt stuff, eating her out,

132
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,102
stuff she's never done before.

133
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,770
And she's-
- Bro, bro.

134
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,081
You talk about wanting
her to wear a dog mask?

135
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,182
What are you talking about?

136
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,140
What are you talking about?

137
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,008
These are your words.

138
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,276
You wrote this.

139
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,576
You talk about,

140
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,679
hey, hey.
- Let me just see it.

141
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:40,891
Let me see it.
- You talk about fingers.

142
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,650
And licking of the anus, right-

143
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,852
Keep your paws to yourself.

144
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,586
- Let me just see it.
- No!

145
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,688
You talk about licking up cum.

146
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,523
So much cum.

147
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,601
You're, hey, all right, I'm
getting outta the car now.

148
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,861
Don't fuck with me, man!

149
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,564
Don't fuck with me!
(car door slams)

150
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,310
(camera clicking)
Take a long, hard look.

151
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,769
(car engines starts)

152
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,904
This is what a pedophile
looks like.

153
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,706
(car engine revving)
Yo!

154
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,208
What the fuck!

155
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,709
Don't do that!

156
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,779
(car crashes)
(car engine revving)

157
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,780
No, no, no!

158
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,281
(car engine revving)

159
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,649
(suspenseful music)

160
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,019
What the fuck!

161
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:18,953
Yo!

162
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,187
Dang, boy.

163
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,290
What the hell are you doing?

164
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,026
Don't fuck with me!

165
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,795
(loud banging)

166
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,828
Fuck!

167
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,342
Oh, fuck,
if my camera's fucked up,

168
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,702
I'm gonna be fucking pissed off.

169
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,705
(suspenseful music)

170
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,939
I swear to God!

171
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:43,277
I swear to God,
if this shit's fucked...

172
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,945
Fuck!

173
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,981
(car engine revving)
Oh fuck, what the fuck!

174
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,849
(suspenseful music)

175
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,752
(dramatic music)

176
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,221
(tense music)

177
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:01,796
(keys clicking)

178
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,064
(tense music)

179
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,799
Hey, Tom, right?

180
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,300
Hey, man.

181
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,978
(Benny exclaiming in
dragons peak: Graxxmarrrrr)

182
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:10,637
(tense music)

183
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,145
(keys clicking)

184
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,756
You're trying to run
away from the fact that

185
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,083
you were meeting up
with a 13 year old girl?

186
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,885
(pensive music)

187
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,733
(birds chirping)

188
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,602
(car passing by)

189
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:47,975
Holy shit.

190
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,112
The name's Jansen.

191
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,248
Benny Jansen.

192
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,283
(phone vibrating)
Oh, fuck.

193
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:00,287
Hey, what's up?

194
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,022
[Nicole] What do you mean,
what's up?

195
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,900
You haven't given me updates
in days on you know who!

196
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,402
Look, I'm kind of in the
middle of something right now.

197
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,761
I can't really talk.

198
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,063
Also, I'm sorry,

199
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,764
since when is it my
responsibility

200
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,900
to give you play by plays?

201
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,768
[Nicole] I showed you this guy.

202
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,071
Yeah, no, I...

203
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,275
I know, I just.

204
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,910
I just usually work alone,
is all.

205
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,745
[Nicole] Okay, but
he's my best friend's dad

206
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,822
and I might be sleeping
over at his time tonight.

207
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,047
Yeah.

208
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,082
I know, I know.

209
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,417
That's why I'm like,

210
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,420
trying to protect you
or whatever.

211
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,755
Oh my God, so I was right?

212
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,224
He's like a total fucking creep?

213
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,060
Yeah, no he's a bad, bad dude.

214
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,005
He's one of the most aggressive
I've ever dealt with.

215
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,331
Motherfucker, I fucking knew it!

216
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,167
He's always been so
fucking creepy towards me.

217
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,202
Let's fucking get him
tonight, get him tonight.

218
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,971
(pensive music)

219
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,005
Uh.

220
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,946
All right, just calm
down for a second, okay?

221
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,482
[Nicole] How the fuck can you
say that? How can I be calm?

222
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,052
Um, look, I'm gonna have
to call you back, all right.

223
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,096
[Nicole] Wait, wait,
wait, Benny, Benny, no.

224
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,021
All right, bye.

225
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,024
(suspenseful music)

226
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,747
- Benny, Benny, Jansen.
- Yeah, what's up?

227
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,449
Who's asking?
- Hannah Morgan, here.

228
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,127
What do you have to say about
the Sheriff's press release

229
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,852
calling on you to stop making
your videos?

230
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,387
What?

231
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,065
Sheriff Margaret Harvey
released a press statement

232
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,091
condemning your vigilante
behavior.

233
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,492
Do you have any comment
about that?

234
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,428
Wow, what's pretty big time,
isn't it?

235
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,495
[Hannah] Excuse me?

236
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,997
No, I've not heard about this,

237
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,041
but I'll give it the old
Google search

238
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,933
when I go home, all right?

239
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,344
I think what everybody wants
to know, why do you do this?

240
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,803
Why do I do what?

241
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,371
Why do I expose predators?
- Yes.

242
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,806
Why do you wanna hide them?

243
00:08:58,839 --> 00:08:59,883
I'm not hiding anything,
are you?

244
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,308
Whoa, Hannah, I didn't realize

245
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,519
you were gonna be so feisty
in real life.

246
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,378
I love it.

247
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,455
Did you know that some of
the cases you're involved in

248
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,214
can't be properly prosecuted

249
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,159
because your chat logs don't
meet evidence guidelines?

250
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,518
You admit some of them can
be properly prosecuted, right?

251
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,829
Don't you believe that
the police

252
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,355
and the DAs know what's best?

253
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,823
I think the police don't know

254
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,925
what side they're playing
for, okay.

255
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,469
[Hannah] Do you always
feel above the law?

256
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,928
All right, I'm late.

257
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,329
I gotta go on a run, all right.

258
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,540
This has been real fun,
but I gotta go.

259
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:27,134
(pensive ambient music)

260
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:44,318
(tense reflective music)

261
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,613
Too fucking good!

262
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,259
Get the ball, come on,
set the screen.

263
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,618
(men scuffling and chattering)

264
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,619
Easy.

265
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,987
Banks open, motherfucker.

266
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,656
(tense reflective music)

267
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,158
(men exclaiming)

268
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,302
Yeah, do it again, do it again.

269
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,228
(Benny clapping)

270
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,339
[Basketballer] Watch
the guy in front!

271
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:04,465
(men scuffling and chattering)

272
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,266
Play ball, play ball, play ball.

273
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,235
(men indistinctly chattering)

274
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,270
(reflective music)

275
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,304
Oh!

276
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,373
- Oh!
- Oh!

277
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,286
Do that shit, run that shit.

278
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,379
(body thuds)

279
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,446
Ew!

280
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,048
What the fuck is up, biatch!

281
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,351
- That's a fucking charge.
- No.

282
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:25,595
I'm sorry, what?
- Hey, hey, hey.

283
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,054
Yo, play the game.

284
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:27,921
You take that shit.

285
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:28,956
Let's go, bitch!

286
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,457
I run this fucking shit.

287
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,593
This is my fucking court!

288
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,428
Benny mother fucking Jansen.

289
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,131
Benny mother fucking
Jansen, bitch!

290
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,166
Fuck!

291
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,434
Yo, fuck you!

292
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:44,304
(tense reflective music)

293
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,472
(loud banging)

294
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,608
(gun bangs)

295
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,641
Hey, what's up?

296
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,078
You don't know what I'm
talking about?

297
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,180
No, you got no idea?

298
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,048
No, yeah, I'm talking to you.

299
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,093
Oh, so tell me, you're just
here to admire the scenery then?

300
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,495
Yeah, the beautiful
fucking scenery.

301
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,519
Is that it?

302
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,293
Why are you looking at me
like that?

303
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,071
Why are you fucking looking
at me like that then?

304
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,130
Why are you looking at me
like that, huh?

305
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,165
Come on.

306
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, you fucking pervert.

307
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,277
You know that I could beat
the fucking shit out of you,

308
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,703
if you wanted to,
but I'm not gonna.

309
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,013
Fucking talk to me,
she was 13 years old.

310
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:17,504
What's that you little bitch?

311
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,072
Huh, huh!

312
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,073
What's this?

313
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,308
Oh, bitch, guess what?

314
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,610
(gun bangs)

315
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,381
Whoa!
(tense rhythmic music)

316
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,150
(Benny laughing)

317
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:33,420
(tense rhythmic music)

318
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,145
This is my impression of you.

319
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,514
Come on.

320
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,450
(audio speeds up) There
is some of this stuff.

321
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,319
I mean, it's really sick stuff.

322
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,287
(audio speeds up)

323
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,689
Is your name Benny Jensen?

324
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,258
(audio rewinds quickly)

325
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,626
Is your name Benny Jensen?

326
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,010
(light clicking)

327
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,622
(digital whirring)

328
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,057
(Benny heavily inhales, sighs)

329
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,327
(notification beeping)

330
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,630
Hmm.

331
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:56,270
(notification beeping)

332
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,711
(electric whirring)

333
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,487
(light typing)

334
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,522
(notification beeping)
(light tapping)

335
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,457
(pensive music)

336
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:18,793
(Benny scoffs)

337
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:21,461
(pensive music)

338
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,264
(lips trilling)

339
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:32,072
Okay, you're the man.

340
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,411
What's up, Mother Dunkers?

341
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,212
Welcome back.

342
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,717
We are on day eight of chatting
with our teacher friend.

343
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,387
The online poker mistro
predator himself

344
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,724
has just messaged me

345
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:52,459
and I can tell he's
feeling a little frisky.

346
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,127
So you know what time
it is, huh?

347
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,297
That means,
it's time to dominate.

348
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,200
(pensive music)

349
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,234
Hey, cutie pie.

350
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,606
Hey.
(notification beeping)

351
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,509
How was work?

352
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:10,821
(notification beeping)
Jason is typing.

353
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,613
Well, hurry the fuck up, Jason.

354
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,648
My students were taking
tests all day,

355
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,884
so I gambled online for
most of it.

356
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,854
Okay, this guy does not sound
like a very good teacher.

357
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,521
And thought of you of, course.

358
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,690
Or person.

359
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,326
How was school?
(pensive music)

360
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,262
It's so boring.

361
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,500
School sucks. (chuckles)

362
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,533
That's funny.

363
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:40,374
I can't believe you're
a teacher.

364
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,342
(notification beeping)

365
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,711
I wish you were my student.

366
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,891
All right, I know what
I'm gonna hit him with.

367
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,317
I wish I were your student.

368
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,786
Look, she's winking at
you, Jason.

369
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:52,887
What ya gonna do, bro?

370
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,955
What ya gonna do?

371
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:54,956
She's winking right at you.

372
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,791
Oh, he responded, okay.

373
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,860
Maybe we could have some
fun tonight.

374
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,460
Okay, here we go, here we go.

375
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:06,400
Um, yeah,
wanna meet up by my house?

376
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,403
(notification beeping)
Come on, Jason.

377
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,874
I want to do more than
meet, L-O-L.

378
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,275
Oh, God, more than meet?

379
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,711
Maybe you could show me
more of you.

380
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,545
Un uh, got 'em.

381
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,415
You can't ask a seventh
grader for nudes.

382
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,318
That's freaking child
pornography!

383
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,688
Maybe you could go first.

384
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:31,558
My boobs and butt are so small,

385
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,928
it's embarrassing.
(keys typing)

386
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,495
L-O-L.

387
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,330
God, you sound so cute,
LOL (scoffs).

388
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,566
Please show me.

389
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,401
I promise, I will love it.

390
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:44,972
Okay, Jason,
you're like objectifying me.

391
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,674
So stop it, asshole.

392
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,609
I'm gonna go for the Hail Mary.

393
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,946
I just want to meet up.

394
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:54,581
Jason is typing.
(notification beeping)

395
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,416
I don't know,

396
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,690
especially, if you're not
willing to let me see anything.

397
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:01,723
Fuck.

398
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:04,726
(pensive music)

399
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,027
You got this, you got this.

400
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,895
(grunts) Don't think about it.

401
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:08,963
Holy shit.

402
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,734
Holy shit.
(razor vibrating)

403
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,535
(pensive music)

404
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:18,773
(razor scraping)

405
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,843
(pensive music)

406
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:22,844
What the fuck?

407
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,678
Oh, my God!

408
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:29,449
Ew, money, that's money.
(camera clicks)

409
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,517
Uh ha.

410
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,886
(phone ringing)
No.

411
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,520
No!

412
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,655
Nicole, no, hang up.
- Benny, is that you?

413
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:36,656
- Nicole, don't look.
- Benny, what are you doing?

414
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,325
I told you, I'm busy.

415
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,669
You have to respect my
privacy when I'm working.

416
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:40,738
[Nicole] Who's boobs are those?

417
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:44,732
(end of call notification)

418
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:46,868
(phone ringing)

419
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,936
(sighs) Fuck.

420
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,739
(phone ringing)

421
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,780
Yo, why did you hang up?

422
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,413
Yo, what the fuck?

423
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,016
I told you I'm busy.

424
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,416
Okay, sorry, geez.

425
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,520
What were you doing though?

426
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,090
- I was just...
- What?

427
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,390
I don't know.

428
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,926
What did it look like to you?

429
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:15,695
It looks like you were
pushing your boobs together.

430
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,464
[Benny] Shit.

431
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,466
Wait, is that for him?

432
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,703
- Uh, yeah, but-
- Okay, so we're getting him?

433
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:23,938
I wanna be there.

434
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:25,572
I wanna see his face.
- Whoa.

435
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,908
Easy.

436
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,810
First of all, there's no,
we, all right.

437
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,687
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but there's never been a we.

438
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,014
I'm not gonna film myself
busting a pedophile

439
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,448
with my 16-year-old
partner in crime

440
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,618
because that is fucking insane.

441
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,030
Second of all, he's not
gonna meet up with me

442
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:41,354
unless I send him a nude.

443
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,057
So I'm fucked.

444
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,425
Okay, so just Google like
pictures of naked little girls

445
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,794
and then send one to him.

446
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:48,528
No, it's not that simple,
all right.

447
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,064
He's smart, okay.

448
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,775
He's gonna reverse image
search anything I send him.

449
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,500
He'll know if I got it off
the internet.

450
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,502
Well, what about the
picture that you just took

451
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,504
with your chest?

452
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,774
Believe it or not, it's
too fake, so it doesn't work.

453
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,943
Well, I'm not gonna let
Megan spend one more night

454
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,945
in a house with that
monster, okay.

455
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:06,546
I know, okay, I get it. I
don't know if I'll be able

456
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,783
to get this guy anytime
soon, okay?

457
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:10,117
[Nicole] Why?

458
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,651
Because the sheriffs' on my ass,

459
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,486
they've got cops following
me around

460
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,498
and now news reporters are
stopping me on the streets

461
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,556
for interviews.

462
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,992
So what?

463
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:21,028
So my block is too hot
right now, all right.

464
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:22,562
I wanted to get this guy tonight

465
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,165
before my interview goes out,

466
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,434
but (scoffs) I don't think
that's gonna happen, okay.

467
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,501
What if...

468
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,706
I sent you a pic?
- No!

469
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,607
No, absolutely not!

470
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,978
And why, I have a bunch,
well, I have a few already.

471
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,880
And they don't even show my face

472
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:40,824
so I can just send you one and
then you can send it to him,

473
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,059
but then we can get him tonight.

474
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,618
No, because you are 16
years old.

475
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,554
That is completely crossing
the line, all right.

476
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,157
Since when do you give a
shit about crossing the line?

477
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:52,894
You do whatever it takes
to get these guys, right?

478
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,596
You're like a fucking superhero.

479
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,700
(sighs) You really think so?

480
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:02,069
I do.

481
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,205
You put your life on
the line every day

482
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:08,075
to take down like the
most evil people on Earth.

483
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,477
Your videos literally
inspire millions of people,

484
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,645
like including me.

485
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,182
You're like fucking Batman.

486
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:16,918
Let me be your Robin!

487
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,821
Come on. (laughs)

488
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:22,165
Who would play me in
the movie then?

489
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:23,724
Tom Holland, looks-wise.

490
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,226
What, no, fuck that.

491
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,962
That kid is like a total
fucking squirt.

492
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,797
I'm double his size.

493
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,498
Okay, but he's so cute.

494
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, he's so cute.

495
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,577
He's like little and you
can put him in your pocket

496
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,903
and then go walk around
with him.

497
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:38,773
I'm like a ruggedly
handsome man.

498
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:39,974
Okay.

499
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,909
[Benny] You don't think so?

500
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,244
No, I...

501
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,946
I do think so.

502
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:48,082
(laughs) Thank you.

503
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,616
Yeah, welcome.

504
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:52,552
Okay, I just sent it to you.

505
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,222
(phone vibrates)

506
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,760
Oh my God, no, Nicole, no, no.

507
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:00,895
Why did you just do that?

508
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,163
I already did it.

509
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,697
It's done.

510
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,008
No, I'm going to
immediately delete

511
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,901
whatever you just sent me, okay.

512
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:07,902
No, you won't.

513
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,170
Yes, I will.

514
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:10,938
Why did you do that to me?

515
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,505
So then you can send it to him

516
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,641
and then we can get him tonight.

517
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,519
No, it's gonna go straight
into the trash, all right.

518
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,713
Benny, if you don't do
something tonight,

519
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:19,981
then I will, okay.

520
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:21,849
The fuck is that supposed
to mean?

521
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:23,650
(light knocking)

522
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,952
Shit, I gotta go.

523
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,653
No, no, no, hold on.

524
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:27,731
What does that mean?
(end of call notification)

525
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:30,590
(pensive music)

526
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:00,788
(engine revving)

527
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,791
(light clattering)

528
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:21,242
(drawer opens, shuts)

529
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,914
(gun cocks)

530
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:38,558
(suspenseful music)

531
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,364
(door opens)

532
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:46,233
(dramatic music)

533
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:52,173
(faint chattering)
(tense music)

534
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,041
What'd you do, come on?

535
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,743
Oh, Jesus, fuck.
(suspenseful music)

536
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:58,312
- Come on, now, let's go.
- Yo, what the fuck?

537
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:00,314
Jesus,
why do you look so freaked?

538
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:01,982
- Yeah, you good?
- No, I'm fine.

539
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:02,850
What's up,
what are you guys doing here?

540
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:03,751
What do you want?

541
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,152
Uh, poker night.

542
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,958
This dude won't leave you alone.

543
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,359
I know, I'm fucking sick of him.

544
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:14,228
Yo, are you gonna send him pics?

545
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,696
Mm, maybe this will get
him excited.

546
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,767
Oh my God, is that you?

547
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,902
Hell yeah, boy,
that's fucking me.

548
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:23,304
Wait, what?

549
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,981
You know, I'm guessing
it's stuff like this

550
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,374
that the sheriff views
as inadmissible evidence.

551
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:29,243
Let me see, let me see.

552
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:31,712
Okay, yeah, well, the
sheriff is a power hungry bitch

553
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,390
who doesn't know what
the she's talking about

554
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:34,748
so she can get fucked.

555
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,117
Holy fuck, this is hot.

556
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,218
Fucking right, it's hot.

557
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,752
Look at those curves, son.

558
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:41,255
It's like bow-chick-a-wow-wow.

559
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,990
Oh damn,
can I send myself this pic?

560
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:44,992
No, you cannot send
yourself that fucking pic.

561
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:46,693
Give me my phone back.

562
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,205
What, I'm only gonna
use it for jacking off.

563
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:49,940
That's why I don't want
you to fucking have it.

564
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:51,775
Wait, so you're like
still going after this guy

565
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,767
with like all the shit
that's going on?

566
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,041
No, probably not until things

567
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,113
have cooled down a little bit,

568
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:57,438
which sucks because a viewer

569
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:58,772
actually tipped me off
about him.

570
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,374
Damn, who's this, she's cute.

571
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,885
Who's who, what are you
looking at? Give me that back.

572
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,044
I accidentally swiped,
chill out.

573
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:05,078
This chick.

574
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,948
Yeah, no, that's, yeah,

575
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:10,683
that's the girl who tipped me
off, Nicole.

576
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:13,821
The guy is her best
friend's dad.

577
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,857
- This fucking guy has a kid?
- Yep.

578
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:20,261
He's a dad, a husband,
a math teacher,

579
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,196
an extremely developed
individual

580
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:23,696
in the eyes of society

581
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:26,333
asking a seventh grader
for nudes.

582
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:27,835
Can I have my phone back now?

583
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,336
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
let me see.

584
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,370
[Benny] Fine.

585
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,375
All right,
so like what's her deal?

586
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:36,710
She's a hardcore fan, you know,

587
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,021
she's been commenting on my page

588
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,480
since like the very beginning.

589
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,081
That's really it.
- Hmm.

590
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,049
[Benny] Can I have my
phone back now?

591
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,083
She looks pretty young.

592
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,718
Yeah, no she is.

593
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:45,795
She actually still goes to
East Birchwood.

594
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,254
Oh, shit, Bulldogs, represent!

595
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:48,789
She's in high school.

596
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,725
She's so smart,
but she loves theater.

597
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,093
She's like a total drama geek.

598
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:54,728
And she's always like

599
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,173
talking about theater this,
theater that.

600
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:58,799
It's just,
she makes me laugh sometimes.

601
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,101
But yeah, we would've never
talked in high school.

602
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,403
I raise five.

603
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,371
Do you guys like talk a lot now?

604
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,207
Don't go through my
messages, okay.

605
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,741
Hey.

606
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:08,818
I shouldn't have to
tell you that.

607
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,777
Sorry, man, fuck, I call.

608
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,345
Whoa.

609
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:12,856
Dude, why don't you just
like take what you have

610
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,782
to the cops, all right?

611
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,526
It sounds like you have
plenty of dirt on this guy.

612
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,319
Fuck those pigs, all right.

613
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,121
Cops think that chat logs
are too flimsy

614
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:23,824
on their own anyways so it
wouldn't even fucking work.

615
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,135
Let's just invite his ass over.

616
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,827
Oh, duh!

617
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,997
Fuck yeah, let's invite
a predator into my home.

618
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,298
Show him where I live.

619
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:32,900
Maybe deal him in for
a few hands.

620
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,177
(laughs) No, we'd beat
the shit out of him.

621
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,769
Great idea, Ryan.

622
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,447
I'm sure your parole
officer would love that.

623
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,240
Why would we tell him?

624
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,775
Okay, you know, this is
like my monthly one night out

625
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,844
from Ben and Charlie, all right?

626
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,145
I don't know.

627
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,256
I don't think it would be
very kosher

628
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,349
if I assaulted someone.

629
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,985
Yeah, I really, I hate
to break it to you, Ryan,

630
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,420
but nobody's getting
their ass beat tonight.

631
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:55,389
Not when I got all this
heat on me, you know,

632
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:56,924
I'm a wanted man right now.

633
00:25:56,957 --> 00:26:00,194
Damn, so I guess you're
about to lose

634
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,563
your biggest fan then, huh?

635
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:04,965
I'm sorry, what did you
just fucking say to me?

636
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:08,369
What was that one word
you just said, lose?

637
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,037
I don't know what that
word means.

638
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,281
I've never even really
encountered that word.

639
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,473
Could you spell it for me?

640
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:13,507
Spell it out.

641
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,209
All right, I check.

642
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,311
No, no, no,
I'm being dead serious, Sam.

643
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:19,380
I mean, can you use it in
a sentence?

644
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,115
Like, I don't know.

645
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,984
Sam is about to lose

646
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:26,253
a shit ton of money on
this hand.

647
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,189
I'm just saying,

648
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:31,892
if you just let this guy
keep doing what he's doing,

649
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,227
well, this girl (sighs),

650
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:37,097
she's gonna hate you.

651
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,100
(light rock music)

652
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,978
Fuck, goddamn it.

653
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,579
All right,
you fucking win, okay?

654
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,948
- I tried to tell you.
- Fucking hell.

655
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:56,317
Brian, give me my laptop.

656
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,985
Here.
- Dude.

657
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:01,255
- Fucking eh, yo.
- Since I'm, you know...

658
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,391
(indistinct chatter)

659
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,128
(pensive music)

660
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,069
(light clicking)

661
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,236
(pensive music)

662
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,972
(light typing)

663
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:23,310
(playful ambient music)

664
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,289
[Brian] You're the one
who owns the chips, also.

665
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,657
I just invited him over.

666
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,125
Fuck, yeah.
(pensive music)

667
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,427
What, wait.
(Benny laughing)

668
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:41,295
What the fuck?

669
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,330
(pensive music)

670
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:44,665
(notification beeping)

671
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:47,468
(pensive music)

672
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:52,206
(notification beeping)

673
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:55,008
(pensive music)

674
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,283
What the fuck, man.

675
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,418
Why did you do that?

676
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,495
I gotta do this video, tonight.

677
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,420
So we're beating his ass?

678
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:07,488
Let's fucking do it.

679
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,022
I'm down, I'm fucking ready.

680
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:10,133
No, no, no,
let's just message him

681
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,158
and tell him not to come.

682
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,226
Benny?

683
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:15,028
(pensive music)

684
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,433
Benny, call it off, dude!

685
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:22,069
Oh my.
(pensive music)

686
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:25,339
Sam, calm the fuck down.

687
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,241
I have a plan.

688
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,618
You just said that you don't
want this man in your home.

689
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:30,277
Okay, we can't make one of
your videos.

690
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,678
So call it off.

691
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,480
We're gonna make a
different kind of video.

692
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,482
What the fuck are you
talking about?

693
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:36,559
I still think that we should

694
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,384
just beat the outta this animal.

695
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:38,685
Oh, shut up!

696
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
Oh, I'm like nervous.

697
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,156
I'm like almost shaking.

698
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:44,224
I feel like I was like...

699
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:46,026
(light knocking)

700
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,730
What?
(faint TV chatter)

701
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,364
(pensive music)

702
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:51,565
[Jason] Hey.

703
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,736
What you girls watching?

704
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,270
Nothing, what do you want?

705
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:58,572
[Jason] I'm just headed
out for a bit.

706
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:01,475
Wanted to say, bye.
- Okay, whatever.

707
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:02,576
[Jason] Hi, Nicole.

708
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,012
Hey.

709
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:07,047
[Jason] Hey, there she is.

710
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,315
Okay, goodbye dad.

711
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:09,526
[Jason] Okay, yep, I'm leaving.

712
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,186
Bye-bye-bye.
(pensive music)

713
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:15,422
This guy's like, weirdly hot.

714
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:17,357
(pensive music)

715
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,636
Hey, I just realized that I
forgot my toothbrush at home.

716
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,595
So I think I'm just gonna
drive home and grab it.

717
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:23,139
Okay, do you wanna
ask my dad for a ride?

718
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,598
No, no, no, it's okay.

719
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:26,142
I have my car.
- Okay, well come back quick.

720
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,167
Okay, I will.

721
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,101
Love you.
- Love you.

722
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:31,171
(suspenseful music)

723
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,275
Hey, where are you going, honey?

724
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,276
I'll be right back.

725
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,346
(suspenseful music)

726
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,319
(door closes)

727
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:48,388
(suspenseful music)

728
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,179
(engine starts, revs)

729
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,514
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

730
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,315
So we can't bust him, right?
- Yeah.

731
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,383
We can't beat him up.

732
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:17,819
This is fucking ridiculous.

733
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,529
Let's just message him
and tell him to go home.

734
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:21,655
All right, what if I
pretend to be the girl?

735
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:22,656
- What?
- Yeah.

736
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,525
I'm small, right?

737
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:25,769
I'm sure Benny's got like a
wig or some shit I can wear.

738
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:27,227
[Sam] And then what, huh?

739
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,696
You gonna suck him off or
something?

740
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:32,699
No, Sam,
I'm not going to suck him off.

741
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:34,368
[Sam] Okay,
so please tell me what...

742
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:38,505
(pensive music)

743
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:43,677
Hey, guys,

744
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,121
So I've been suspicious
that my friend's dad

745
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,446
has been doing some shady shit,

746
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,515
which has been confirmed
by CreepDunk

747
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,217
so go ahead and subscribe to him

748
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,252
'cause he makes really
good vids.

749
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,831
Okay, anyway, so I've been
following him for like 10 minutes

750
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:55,365
and I think he's gonna go
meet with an underage girl.

751
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:57,624
So let's see where this
goes, okay.

752
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,202
After I sweet talk him for
a little bit,

753
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,704
it's just start getting
hot and heavy.

754
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,429
- Hot and heavy?
- Yeah.

755
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,565
Like for the fucking video,
Sam, keep up, all right.

756
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,333
Like maybe we're on the bed,

757
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,402
he's got his hands on
me, he's about to kiss.

758
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:09,445
He's obviously hard as fuck.

759
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:10,437
You gotta be kidding me.

760
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,873
And then, boom!

761
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,516
You guys come out in
fucking ski masks, right?

762
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,818
You come out, when you scream,
you scream,

763
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:16,176
we got you motherfucker!

764
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,578
We got this on shit tape.

765
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,212
And he's sitting there

766
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,791
like fully about to fuck this
little girl.

767
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:22,592
Jesus, I'm done with this,
I'll fucking message him.

768
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,656
No, wait Benny, come on.

769
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,319
You like my plan, right?

770
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,621
Wait, what is happening
right now?

771
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,691
Fuck, he's here.
(heavily breathing)

772
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:31,692
(car door shuts)

773
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:32,860
(car alarm beeps)

774
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:35,128
(pensive music)

775
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,764
Okay, okay.

776
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,500
Okay, so he's parked
in front of this house.

777
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:41,812
Oh, and I can't see what's
going on inside

778
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,470
'cause the blinds are
all closed.

779
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:45,639
Set up a hand, okay?

780
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,140
Follow my lead.

781
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,418
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no I can't.

782
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,687
(light knocking)
I can't, I can't do.

783
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,411
I can't do this.
- Sam, shut the fuck up.

784
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,580
And whatever I say, no
matter how fucked up it is,

785
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:54,749
just go with it.

786
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:58,518
(suspenseful music)

787
00:31:58,552 --> 00:32:01,388
(dramatic music)

788
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,461
Yo, what's up dude?

789
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:10,464
Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.

790
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:11,541
I must have the wrong house.

791
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:13,400
No, you're the um,

792
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:15,378
you're the math tutor, right?

793
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,938
You're here to see Lizzie?

794
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:18,806
Uh?

795
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,883
[Benny] It's Jason, right?

796
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:22,910
No, I, I, well, uh, yeah.

797
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:25,312
That is your name, isn't it?

798
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:27,514
Yes, yes, uh.

799
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:29,884
I'm sorry, you're her?

800
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:30,918
Her brother.

801
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:32,820
No, no, no, stepbrother.

802
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:35,288
Our parents are off to Aruba.

803
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:36,858
So she's staying at my place.

804
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:40,560
It's their annual spring
getaway, you know? (laughing)

805
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:42,930
I can't see who he's talking to.

806
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,431
He looks nervous.

807
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,366
He's like moving his arms
around, uh.

808
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,835
Okay.

809
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,345
Yeah, she's just out
running a few errands,

810
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:50,413
but she should be back
really soon, so.

811
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:51,338
Oh, okay.

812
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,206
Well, that's fine.

813
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
I'll just come by some
other time.

814
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:56,443
No, no, no, man.

815
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,354
Me and some buddies are just
playing some poker right now.

816
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,589
If you want, we could totally
deal you in for a few hands.

817
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:00,614
You could kill some time.

818
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,648
Maybe have a drink if-

819
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:02,784
Oh, I, I don't.

820
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:04,952
No, I, I-
- Are you sure?

821
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,754
Thank you, though.

822
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:08,431
She said she's got that
super important test tomorrow

823
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:10,557
and it sounded like she
really wants to see you,

824
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,993
like tonight.

825
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,360
You know, it's, uh.

826
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,229
It's pretty late.

827
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:19,700
You know, let me just
message her real quick

828
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:20,968
and see if she wants to meet

829
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,335
like early tomorrow or
something.

830
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,004
Sure, sure, man.

831
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:24,337
Whatever works.

832
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:42,522
Everything all good, man?

833
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:43,657
You seem a little nervous.

834
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,792
Oh, no, no, no, I...

835
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,528
(notification beeping)

836
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:49,964
Okay, um.

837
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:54,501
She said that she still
wants to meet tonight.

838
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,669
So great, come on in.

839
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:57,004
It's freezing.

840
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:57,872
Okay.

841
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,539
Atta boy!

842
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:00,573
Right this way.

843
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,678
Fuck.
(ice clanks)

844
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:07,915
(cards shuffling)
(objects clattering)

845
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:10,550
Yo, this is Jason,

846
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:12,385
Lizzie's math tutor.

847
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,354
This is Sam.
- Hey.

848
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,456
- And this is Ryan.
- Yo.

849
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,859
- Yo.
- Yeah.

850
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:19,559
He's just gonna kill some
time with us

851
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:21,294
until Lizzie gets back, so.

852
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,397
Sorry to interrupt, fellas.

853
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,665
Dude, no way.

854
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,077
You are not interrupting,
all right.

855
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,636
But do you have cash,
is the only thing?

856
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,671
We are playing at a $50
buy-in tonight.

857
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:33,306
Oh, no, no, no.

858
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,650
I'll just, I'll just sit
down and watch, you know?

859
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:35,953
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

860
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:37,677
I mean, she'll be back
soon, right?

861
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:39,388
Yeah, yeah, yeah, really,
really, really soon.

862
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,581
(pensive music) Let me grab
you a drink.

863
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,615
How about that?

864
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,721
As the Spaniards say, "Mi
casa es su casa, amigo".

865
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:48,990
So just chillax.

866
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:50,725
Take a load off.

867
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:51,926
Make yourself comfortable.

868
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,729
(pensive music)

869
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,800
Boys, where were we?

870
00:34:58,833 --> 00:34:59,967
I'm out.

871
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,601
It's your bet.

872
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:06,007
Hmm, what do I want to bet?

873
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,810
(pensive music)

874
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:09,843
I bet.

875
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:14,548
This much.

876
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:15,983
Jesus Christ.

877
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,986
Oh, fuck.

878
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,522
Dude, do you remember that
girl I was telling you about?

879
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:23,858
Check out this fucking text?

880
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,359
Is she fucking asking for
it or what?

881
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:28,863
Oh, um, yeah, yeah.

882
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,066
Doesn't get much more
blatant than that.

883
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,969
Check it out.

884
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,322
Can you assholes gimme a second?

885
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:43,010
Oh, that's...

886
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:45,913
Cool, nice.
- Yeah.

887
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,380
[Ryan] That's good for you.

888
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:48,826
Are we gonna play this
fucking game

889
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,093
or are we just gonna
sit around, all night?

890
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:51,517
What's going on?
- Right, right, uh.

891
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,653
I, uh.

892
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,091
I call.

893
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:58,124
Turn 'em.

894
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:00,828
(Ryan nervously laughs)

895
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,129
You motherfucker!

896
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:03,406
I could have sworn you
had nothing

897
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,732
and then you bust this shit out?

898
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:05,632
You know, that's poker for ya.

899
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:06,934
Come on!

900
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:09,136
Fuck, dude, I am fucking wasted.

901
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,670
But I've got you fuckers

902
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:14,976
exactly where I want you.
(laughing)

903
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,009
Who's deal is it?

904
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,713
Eh, I, you know what?

905
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:20,924
I'll sit in for a couple
of hands.

906
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:22,515
You know, I mean, you know,

907
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:24,584
if the offer is still on
the table.

908
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:25,685
You sure, man?

909
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,754
No pressure.

910
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:28,455
Yeah, I'll just kill some time

911
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,925
while I wait for Lizzie
to get back, you know?

912
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:33,194
I fucking love it!
Let me get you set up.

913
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,394
Here, take a seat.

914
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:38,431
(pensive music)

915
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,465
Here.

916
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:45,940
So you're tutoring Lizzie?

917
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:48,142
Yeah.
- Yes, algebra, right?

918
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,442
Here, Sam.
- Yeah.

919
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,553
You can deal with the cards.

920
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,445
Yeah, it's just uh, thanks.

921
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,481
You know,
I'm a high school math teacher,

922
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:57,550
but it doesn't hurt to make a
little extra cash on the side,

923
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:58,986
you know what I mean?
- Totally.

924
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,155
Oh yeah,
they don't pay teachers enough.

925
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:03,057
[Ryan] Heroes, all of ya, check.

926
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,726
(gasps) Man, that's,

927
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:08,461
that's so crazy.

928
00:37:09,663 --> 00:37:11,498
What is?

929
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:15,036
Oh, I mean, I don't wanna
brag or anything over here,

930
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:18,005
but I actually slept with

931
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,507
my math teacher back in
high school.

932
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,243
- Really?
- Yeah.

933
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:23,978
Isn't that funny?

934
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:25,645
Yeah.

935
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,990
I actually saw her
today before we played.

936
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,115
She was in the classroom.

937
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:30,718
Wait, really, Mrs. Wiles?

938
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,751
Yeah.

939
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,488
How did that make you feel?

940
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:39,727
Made me feel pretty damn good

941
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,229
considering she's still
hot as shit.

942
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,165
- Damn, for real?
- Yeah.

943
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:45,709
Shit man, you don't know what
Mrs. Wiles looked like, bro.

944
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:47,068
You do not know.

945
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,737
Ass like a goddess.

946
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,706
Every dude in that school
dreamed about her ass

947
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,573
and this guy fucking fucked it.
(laughing)

948
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,243
(Benny laughing)

949
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:58,511
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:00,580
Yeah, I mean it is, it is true.

951
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:02,549
That's uh,

952
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:05,685
that's some pretty crazy
stuff, man.

953
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,588
(laughs) Yeah.

954
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,890
Yeah, it was.

955
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,558
Oh my God.

956
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:14,228
And it happened on the
school property, too.

957
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:16,063
She held me back after class

958
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:18,598
so we could have a talk about
my behavior.

959
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,736
It was straight out of a
bad fucking porno, dude.

960
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,305
I swear to God.
- Wow.

961
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:26,107
I can't fucking blame
her though.

962
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,141
[Jason] Huh?

963
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:28,185
You should have seen me.

964
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,244
I was a freaking stud.

965
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:33,014
I can only imagine

966
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,149
what it's like for guy teachers,
you know.

967
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:37,550
I bet $10.
- Fold.

968
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:42,123
How do you mean?

969
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,156
Call.

970
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:47,627
Just (sighs),

971
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,797
high school girls these
days, man.

972
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,830
I've seen them.

973
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:53,100
If I were you,

974
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:54,878
I wouldn't be able to keep
my eyes on my own paper

975
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:55,903
if you catch my drift.

976
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:56,936
Yeah.

977
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,143
I mean,
like once these girls develop,

978
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,878
you know, fold also,

979
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,781
but yeah, biologically speaking,

980
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:08,849
it is quite difficult actually

981
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,252
to really tell the difference,
you know?

982
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:13,620
Yeah, I would for sure
fuck one of my students,

983
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:14,654
if I was you, bro.

984
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,757
(friends laughing)

985
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,268
That's why you're not
a teacher, Ryan.

986
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:21,362
(Ryan laughing)

987
00:39:21,395 --> 00:39:23,297
I can't be a teacher
'cause of my DUIs, but-

988
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,698
So um. (clears throat)

989
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:28,469
What uh,
what happened with you and her?

990
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,141
- Ms. Wiles?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,676
The teacher.

992
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,710
I bet.

993
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
$10.

994
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:42,348
[Ryan] Fold.

995
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:45,919
Yeah.

996
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:47,788
Did anybody find out?

997
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:50,023
Call.

998
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:53,928
Yeah.

999
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:57,865
Her husband was my
basketball coach.

1000
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,034
- Shit.
- Yeah, shit indeed.

1001
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,869
He found out.

1002
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:05,906
She kind of played the victim
and he fucking lost it.

1003
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,708
He cut me from the team.

1004
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,977
He made me lose all my
scholarships.

1005
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,378
And guess what?

1006
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:13,132
She still fucking teaches
there to this day.

1007
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:14,748
Jesus, man.

1008
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,285
Why, why'd you do it?

1009
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,423
Got tired of fucking
cheerleaders, bro. (laughing)

1010
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:23,824
Yeah.

1011
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,693
Was it, was it worth it?

1012
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,831
Yeah?

1013
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:32,066
Was it worth it?

1014
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,801
Hell fucking, yes,
it was worth it.

1015
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:37,138
It was the best sex I've
ever had in my fucking life.

1016
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,807
I hated basketball anyways,
to be honest.

1017
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,275
I mean, honestly,

1018
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:43,377
I'm just surprised you
didn't press charges.

1019
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,247
(Benny laughing)

1020
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:50,917
Yeah.

1021
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:55,890
You and me both, buddy.
- Yeah.

1022
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:56,923
You and me both.

1023
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,093
But lemme tell you something.

1024
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,695
Deep down,
she really fucking liked me.

1025
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:06,699
She liked it a lot more than I
did, if you know what I mean.

1026
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,271
We had fun.

1027
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,072
Yeah, it sounds like it.

1028
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:21,681
You know what?

1029
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:24,918
I bet.

1030
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:27,321
20 bucks.

1031
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,323
Boom, how is that for some
fucking fun,

1032
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:32,026
am I right? (laughing)

1033
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,397
(chips clanking)

1034
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,998
Call.

1035
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:39,032
Flip 'em.

1036
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:46,507
(laughing) Are you...

1037
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,142
That's all you had, man?

1038
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,743
That's it? (laughing)

1039
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:52,947
Oh, okay, whatever, all right.
(laughing)

1040
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:57,751
Come to me.
(guys laughing)

1041
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:02,189
Oh yeah, but hey,
that's a nice hand.

1042
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,059
- Yeah.
- You got me.

1043
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:07,094
But let me tell you, bluffing,

1044
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:10,164
it's a big part of this game.

1045
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,841
Yeah, well, it looks like
all that wallowing in your past

1046
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,867
took your head out of the
fucking game, am I right?

1047
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,369
(Ryan and Sam laughing)

1048
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:16,780
Wait, what the fuck
did you just say to me?

1049
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,239
Oh, Jason!

1050
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:20,774
Looks like you need a
refill, my guy, right?

1051
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,276
Little bit, top off.

1052
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,913
So uh, am I drinking alone?

1053
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:28,482
What's going on fellas?

1054
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:29,950
No, of course not.

1055
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:32,219
Ryan, pour us all another round.

1056
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:33,854
You sure, man.

1057
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,856
I'm pretty wasted.
- Yes, I'm fucking sure.

1058
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,524
Come on,
we're having a good time.

1059
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,026
It's the boys.

1060
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,895
Let's keep the party
fucking going.

1061
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,765
(Nicole panting)

1062
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:49,036
- Hey, dude.
- Okay.

1063
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,305
(panting) Jesus Christ.

1064
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,341
It sounds like there's like a
whole group of guys in there.

1065
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:58,112
Okay, I feel like I should
warn you guys

1066
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:59,589
that this might be way more
fucked up than I thought,

1067
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:01,324
but I feel like I should
go see what's going on.

1068
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:03,159
So it's just gonna go up
there and knock on the door.

1069
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:04,918
(tires whirring)

1070
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:06,420
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1071
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:08,989
(tires whirring)

1072
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:10,524
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1073
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,894
Hello, hey, you.

1074
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,462
Roll down your window, open.

1075
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:17,231
Open your window, roll it down.

1076
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,966
Roll it down.

1077
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,844
Hello, I need to talk to
you. Roll down your window.

1078
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:21,502
Roll down your window.

1079
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:22,536
Who are you?

1080
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:23,937
Why are you at this house?

1081
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:25,939
How do you know who lives here?

1082
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,975
I'm a friend of Benny Jansen's.

1083
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:29,276
Excuse me?

1084
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,420
Benny Jansen, this is his house.

1085
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,212
Isn't it?
- No.

1086
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,024
- Are you filming me?
- Yeah, I'm filming you, yes.

1087
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:35,482
Are you a friend of Benny's?

1088
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:37,294
How about you answer
my questions first, okay.

1089
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:38,485
(pensive music)

1090
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,620
(Tim scoffs)

1091
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:42,022
Hello, fucker.

1092
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:43,190
Answer my questions.

1093
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:44,491
- Get in the car.
- What, no.

1094
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,026
We could talk in the car.

1095
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,894
No, I'm not gonna get
in the car.

1096
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:47,895
Get in the car.

1097
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:49,963
(suspenseful music)

1098
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,398
Who are you?

1099
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:52,466
(engine starts)
Who are?

1100
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:53,967
What the fuck are you doing?

1101
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:55,969
Hello?

1102
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:57,003
What the fuck?

1103
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,206
What the fuck?
- Whoa.

1104
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,874
What the hell's going on
out there?

1105
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:03,210
Yeah man, since when
did you get neighbors?

1106
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:04,311
Uh, I don't know.

1107
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:06,547
It must be like kids or junkies.

1108
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,916
Like meth heads come out
here to get fucked up.

1109
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:12,252
Quite a slice of paradise
you got for yourself here, man?

1110
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:17,157
(laughing) Well, it
sounds like that they left.

1111
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:18,258
(light knocking on door)

1112
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,194
(suspenseful music)

1113
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:21,362
I guess not.

1114
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:25,199
It must be must be Lizzie, huh?

1115
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:27,034
Yeah, yes.

1116
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,469
It must be Lizzie.

1117
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:29,680
She must have forgot
her keys or something.

1118
00:44:29,704 --> 00:44:31,271
Hold on one second.
- Yeah.

1119
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:33,173
(suspenseful music)
(light knocking on door)

1120
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,575
All right, fellas.

1121
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:37,511
(suspenseful music)
(light knocking on door)

1122
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,446
Benny!
(door shuts)

1123
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,649
(light knocking)
Benny?

1124
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:43,951
Benny!

1125
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:45,285
(light knocking)

1126
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:47,020
Benny, open the door.

1127
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:48,631
Benny, I just saw there's
this fucking guy out there

1128
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:51,058
and I need you to open.
Benny, open the door, Benny!

1129
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,493
(light knocking on door)

1130
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:56,430
(Benny nervously laughing)

1131
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:59,066
What's uh, what's the problem?

1132
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,467
Yeah man, everything all right?

1133
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,469
Um, fuck.
(light knocking)

1134
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:04,438
No, everything is not all right.

1135
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:06,039
Well, what is it?

1136
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,509
It's the girl.

1137
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:09,543
- No!
- Are you joking?

1138
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,044
No, I am not!

1139
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:12,579
Wait, the one you were texting?

1140
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:15,015
Yes, yes, the very one.

1141
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:19,286
Wow, the woman is a desperate
creature.

1142
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:20,687
Totally.

1143
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:24,591
Listen, you guys keep
playing without me

1144
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,294
while I go outside and
deal with this, okay.

1145
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,029
Yeah, all right.

1146
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,974
I think we can survive
without him, right fellas?

1147
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:33,400
Take some of each other's
money for a change.

1148
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:36,170
(laughing) Good one.

1149
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:37,638
That's a good one, man.

1150
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:40,107
Benny, go.

1151
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,744
- Benny, open the door!
- That's right, Benny, go.

1152
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:44,311
(Nicole yelling)

1153
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:45,355
- Nicole, Nicole, Nicole.
- Benny, Benny.

1154
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:46,580
What the fuck is going on?

1155
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,348
Nicole, Nicole, Nicole, Nicole.

1156
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:49,426
You told me that nothing
was happening, tonight.

1157
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,718
Nicole, Nicole, goddamn it.

1158
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:52,352
What the fuck are you
doing here?

1159
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,457
I told you that if you weren't
gonna get him, then I was.

1160
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:00,394
(Benny sighs)

1161
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,529
What?

1162
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:04,164
So you followed him here tonight

1163
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:05,475
because you wanted to catch
him yourself?

1164
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,267
That's what I just fucking said.

1165
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:10,671
(sighs) That's really
fucking brave.

1166
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:12,707
- Really?
- Yes.

1167
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,074
You are fucking awesome.

1168
00:46:14,107 --> 00:46:15,576
Do you hear me?

1169
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,244
I'm serious.

1170
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,679
I'm serious, come here.

1171
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:22,182
(light ambient music)

1172
00:46:22,216 --> 00:46:23,456
Are you two in this together?

1173
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,752
What, Nicole?

1174
00:46:24,786 --> 00:46:26,253
Like is the whole YouTube thing

1175
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:28,021
just a fucking cover or
something?

1176
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:29,499
Nicole, are you listening
to yourself right now?

1177
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:31,124
You sound fucking insane.

1178
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,632
Man, fucking, 16-year-olds.

1179
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:39,700
Am I right?

1180
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,134
Check.

1181
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:44,071
Man, quite a handful.

1182
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:47,775
This is girl is uh, she's 16?

1183
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:48,710
Check.

1184
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:50,644
Yeah, yeah.

1185
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:53,347
She's this crazy bitch that
follows Benny's YouTube channel,

1186
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,749
wants to bang him.

1187
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:59,620
(laughs) That's, yeah,
that's pretty young.

1188
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,455
Yeah.
- For Benny?

1189
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,725
Shit man,
he's gone younger before.

1190
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:05,392
Has he now?

1191
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:06,693
(sighs) Yes, sir.

1192
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,129
Totally, totally.

1193
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:10,162
We uh,

1194
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,567
we all go for younger chicks.

1195
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,435
Really?

1196
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:18,071
I mean, I probably shouldn't
be telling a teacher this,

1197
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:21,441
but yeah.
(pensive music)

1198
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:22,710
Right, Sam?

1199
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:25,546
Uh.
(pensive music)

1200
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:27,180
It's like our thing.

1201
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:29,583
(pensive music)

1202
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:30,718
Huh?

1203
00:47:30,752 --> 00:47:32,386
Because I showed you this guy

1204
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:33,320
and I gave you everything
that you need to know.

1205
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:34,421
And it's always excuses.

1206
00:47:34,454 --> 00:47:35,355
Like it can't happen tonight.

1207
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:36,824
It can't happen tonight.

1208
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:39,293
And then I follow him
to your fucking house.

1209
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:42,396
What are you having dinner
together or something?

1210
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,865
We're playing poker,
okay Nicole.

1211
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:45,532
Well, then.

1212
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,210
Nicole, no, listen,
you have to trust me.

1213
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:48,879
Then you have to tell
me what's going on.

1214
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:51,405
I, you know, man, I'll go
to bars and I'll, you know,

1215
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:53,775
play a little game called
spot the girl

1216
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:56,343
who got in using a fake
ID and then,

1217
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:57,888
and by the time they're back
at my place,

1218
00:47:57,912 --> 00:47:59,513
they don't even know what
it hit 'em.

1219
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:00,480
How about you, Sam?

1220
00:48:00,514 --> 00:48:03,183
Do you play spot the-

1221
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:04,284
Oh no, no, no.

1222
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,421
I, yeah, I haven't in a while.

1223
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:11,258
I've been married a few years
with a newborn actually.

1224
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,694
But before that (laughs),

1225
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:19,533
I used chat rooms.

1226
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:22,168
Dating apps.

1227
00:48:23,871 --> 00:48:25,773
Interesting.
(pensive music)

1228
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,407
I have to get back in
there, okay.

1229
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:28,810
I just, I have to.

1230
00:48:28,843 --> 00:48:30,577
I can't explain everything
to you right now,

1231
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:33,347
but all you need to know
is I'm making a video

1232
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,391
that's gonna be the best
fucking video I've ever made.

1233
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,217
But I need you to leave right
now, please.

1234
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,886
Benny,
that doesn't explain anything.

1235
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,655
(pensive music)

1236
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:44,467
I'll send you the
footage once it's all over.

1237
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:46,226
Oh my God.

1238
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:47,670
I could have just done
this without you, you know?

1239
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:48,629
I should have.

1240
00:48:48,662 --> 00:48:51,431
(pensive music)

1241
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:58,372
Fuck.

1242
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:01,642
(pensive music)
(door closes)

1243
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:03,410
Hey, everything go okay
out there?

1244
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:04,788
Yeah man,
we were just talking about

1245
00:49:04,812 --> 00:49:07,514
how crazy these young
girls can be.

1246
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,451
Yeah, yeah.

1247
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:14,822
Woof, she just wants it
like really bad

1248
00:49:14,856 --> 00:49:17,324
but I told her, not tonight.

1249
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:20,227
Tonight's is boy's nights.

1250
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,864
Man, from what these guys
were telling me about her,

1251
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:24,398
she sounds like she could be

1252
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:25,709
the change of luck you
need tonight.

1253
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,969
(guys laughing)

1254
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:31,672
You did not have the
conversation I just had

1255
00:49:31,706 --> 00:49:34,909
because she is fucking nuts.
(laughs)

1256
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:36,576
The wildest ones

1257
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:37,921
are always the hottest,
though, man, right?

1258
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:39,546
Yes sir, that's the killer,
isn't it?

1259
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:42,416
She is quite physically
mature for her age.

1260
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,886
So uh, so you got like
a picture of this girl?

1261
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:54,796
(Benny laughing)

1262
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:01,435
Oh shit.

1263
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:02,804
Oh shit!

1264
00:50:02,837 --> 00:50:04,939
You dirty dog!

1265
00:50:04,972 --> 00:50:07,374
Hey man, this one's mine.

1266
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:09,543
You gotta go out there and
get your own.

1267
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:11,278
Come on, you know, I know-

1268
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:13,346
I knew this guy was a
sick fuck like us, man.

1269
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,849
Come on, man.

1270
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,250
The age of consent is 16
in Nevada, student or not.

1271
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:20,454
Look you guys are crazy, okay.

1272
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:21,856
Everybody knows,

1273
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:23,758
there's nothing better than
young pussy.

1274
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:25,624
Nothing.

1275
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:37,604
Well, first of all, I bet 10.

1276
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:42,576
Second of all,

1277
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:46,480
okay, yeah,
I've dipped my toes a little.

1278
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:47,749
- Whoa!
- Yeah, man.

1279
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:50,885
(Benny exclaims)

1280
00:50:50,918 --> 00:50:53,888
(muffled laughing)

1281
00:50:57,058 --> 00:51:00,427
(crickets chirping)

1282
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,497
(suspenseful music)

1283
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:06,366
(men yelling)
- All right, all right.

1284
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:07,745
That's what I'm fucking
talking about, man.

1285
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:09,070
I fucking love it, bro.

1286
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:10,370
One of your students?

1287
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:11,873
I fold, man, I'm out, I'm out.

1288
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:12,940
No, no, no, no.

1289
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:14,017
Who's gonna tell us then, man.

1290
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,442
How do you find these girls?

1291
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:16,643
Benny, you in?
- Oh yeah, man.

1292
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:18,311
I am fucking in.
- Well, I fold.

1293
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:19,422
Yeah, you know, I
mean, same as you guys,

1294
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:21,015
just chat rooms, dating apps.

1295
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:24,051
I've been married, God,
since I was like fucking 18,

1296
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:26,453
you know, it's still
the best way to do it.

1297
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:27,654
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1298
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:30,390
I mean, she has no idea.

1299
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:32,927
She doesn't go through
your phone, your laptop?

1300
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,929
It's your bet by the way.

1301
00:51:34,962 --> 00:51:38,900
No, no, I delete all the files

1302
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:41,035
after I save them to
a hard drive.

1303
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:43,636
Oh, uh.

1304
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:45,839
10.

1305
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,441
I uh...

1306
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:52,412
Call.

1307
00:51:52,445 --> 00:51:53,881
I mean, you know,

1308
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:56,951
I mean the things that
these girls will say,

1309
00:51:56,984 --> 00:51:58,986
you know the pictures that
they will send,

1310
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,122
it's fucking wild.

1311
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:03,057
Yeah, you gotta, well, I say,

1312
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:07,460
I save it all for a rainy day.
(laughs)

1313
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:10,797
15.

1314
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:14,936
I bet you got some nasty
stuff in there.

1315
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,369
You wouldn't believe.

1316
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:17,403
Oh!

1317
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,974
I would love to see it.

1318
00:52:20,007 --> 00:52:21,474
(pensive music)

1319
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:22,844
Yeah, I'm sure.

1320
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:25,645
(pensive music)

1321
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:31,751
Call.

1322
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:35,188
Oh, ha!

1323
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:37,490
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1324
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:39,160
I'm sorry, man.

1325
00:52:39,193 --> 00:52:41,138
Listen, I don't mean to be
taking all your money tonight.

1326
00:52:41,162 --> 00:52:42,830
You know that, right?

1327
00:52:42,864 --> 00:52:44,107
You're pretty good at
this shit, aren't you?

1328
00:52:44,131 --> 00:52:45,408
I play online pretty regularly.

1329
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:47,400
Mm, so you're a degenerate.

1330
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:50,437
I've made more money
doing this than,

1331
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,839
than anything else, you know?

1332
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,142
- That's impressive.
- Fucking cool, man.

1333
00:52:55,176 --> 00:52:56,944
Yeah, sure.

1334
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:58,889
You know, I mean, you should
give it a shot, honestly.

1335
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:02,649
You know like if you spent your
time doing something useful,

1336
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:05,987
instead of whatever,
futzing around on YouTube,

1337
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,496
you know, maybe you wouldn't
be losing all your money

1338
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,422
to me tonight. (laughs)

1339
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,959
(pensive music)

1340
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:12,993
Oh!

1341
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,065
That's funny, futzing around?

1342
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:20,768
Oh fuck, that's funny, man.

1343
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:21,836
You're really funny.

1344
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,570
What's so funny about it?

1345
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:26,974
I mean, futz, is kind
of a funny word, right?

1346
00:53:27,008 --> 00:53:29,810
Like what the fuck does
that word even mean?

1347
00:53:30,912 --> 00:53:34,148
You have no idea what's
coming your way, buddy.

1348
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:35,482
No idea.

1349
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:36,583
(pensive music)

1350
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:38,485
What are you talking about?

1351
00:53:38,518 --> 00:53:41,421
(pensive music)

1352
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:55,202
(muffled indistinct chatter)

1353
00:53:55,236 --> 00:53:58,605
(pensive music)

1354
00:53:58,638 --> 00:54:02,143
(muffled indistinct chatter)

1355
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:03,878
(pensive music)
(body thuds)

1356
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:07,748
(muffled indistinct chatter)

1357
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:11,752
So deal the fucking cards
then, Ryan?

1358
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:14,822
(suspenseful music)

1359
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:20,227
Anty up.

1360
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:21,661
I'll check.

1361
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,230
Check.

1362
00:54:23,264 --> 00:54:27,969
Ryan, pour our distinguished
guest another drink.

1363
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:29,737
Oh no, no, no, I'm okay.

1364
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,604
I gotta stay sharp for Lizzie.

1365
00:54:31,638 --> 00:54:33,107
Yeah, yeah, man,

1366
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,885
he can't teach Lizzie how
to figure out what X is

1367
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,043
if he's hammered, right?

1368
00:54:37,178 --> 00:54:39,612
Are we seriously still
going with that?

1369
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,818
Still, going with what?

1370
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,188
You're here to fuck her, right?

1371
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:54,694
All in, by the way.
(chips clanking)

1372
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:00,034
(Nicole shakily breathing)

1373
00:55:03,304 --> 00:55:04,304
I uh,

1374
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:07,908
I fold.
- Hold on, excuse me?

1375
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:10,277
Jesus Christ, I'm not
your fucking wife, Jason.

1376
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:11,321
You don't need to bullshit me.

1377
00:55:11,345 --> 00:55:13,047
It's still your bet.

1378
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,080
I'm sorry.

1379
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:17,051
What are you talking about?

1380
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:20,154
I popped her cherry, okay.

1381
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:24,792
I know she fucks and I
know she likes older men.

1382
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:26,027
Are you, are you.

1383
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:29,330
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1384
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:30,831
What's going on?

1385
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:33,000
What, what,
what the hell's going on?

1386
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:35,269
Ryan, tell him you
fucked her, haven't you?

1387
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:37,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
a bunch of times.

1388
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:39,282
Sam hasn't 'cause of
the old ball and chain.

1389
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:41,574
But look at him,
I know he wants to.

1390
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:43,044
So just say it.

1391
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:46,247
You think you're the first
math tutor to come over here

1392
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,680
and fuck my stepsister?

1393
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:51,118
(ominous music)

1394
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:54,989
I'm cool with it.
(ominous music)

1395
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:58,726
(Nicole shakily breathing)

1396
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:05,900
I guess it's my lucky
night then.

1397
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:08,269
I'm all in, too.

1398
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:11,337
I fold.

1399
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:13,240
Flip em.

1400
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:16,177
(ominous music)

1401
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,778
Oh!

1402
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:19,013
Woof.

1403
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,680
That's all you have?

1404
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:22,125
It's not looking good
for you, buddy. (laughs)

1405
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:23,784
Can this be our last hand?

1406
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,295
I feel like we should
probably call it a night.

1407
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:26,987
No, that would be poor manners.

1408
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:29,723
No running our new friend
off the table like that.

1409
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:33,861
Fuck, yeah!

1410
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,063
It's a shame.

1411
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:37,331
Huh, what is?

1412
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:38,375
You losing all your money
like this?

1413
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,067
No.

1414
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:42,236
I just thought she was a virgin.

1415
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:44,105
Is that like a,

1416
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:45,306
a deal breaker for you?

1417
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:48,042
No, it's just,

1418
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:50,144
it's just different.

1419
00:56:51,678 --> 00:56:52,880
How is it so different?

1420
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,215
Well, I mean,

1421
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,725
well, you know what it's like,
you know,

1422
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:58,119
to be the first, you know.

1423
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:01,055
I bet she didn't even know
what she was doing, right.

1424
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:03,791
You know,
when they're that young,

1425
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:06,827
they can fit right in
the palm of your hand.

1426
00:57:06,861 --> 00:57:10,865
You know,
they're so nervous and cute.

1427
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,369
Confused, though too, sometimes.

1428
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:18,105
But you know, you're
there to take care of 'em,

1429
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,773
to just like, you know,

1430
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:21,809
walk 'em through.

1431
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,044
This one girl, this one time,

1432
00:57:24,078 --> 00:57:25,980
she told me that I made
her feel safe.

1433
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:28,749
You know?

1434
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:30,985
And fuck, man, they're
always so eager, right?

1435
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:32,119
And they're so eager

1436
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:34,288
and they wanna do a good job

1437
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:37,992
because you're showing them
everything.

1438
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:40,660
And you're in total control.

1439
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:44,398
They want you to be in control.

1440
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,003
And they'll just do, you know,

1441
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:51,038
fuck man, they'll do
anything to make you happy.

1442
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,241
Anything.

1443
00:57:54,275 --> 00:57:55,275
Hmm?

1444
00:57:58,512 --> 00:58:00,281
(scoffs) A six makes a straight.

1445
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:05,052
- So have you done it before?
- Yeah.

1446
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:09,890
A couple times.

1447
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:11,759
A couple girls online.

1448
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:13,027
Though, you know, it did,

1449
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:18,432
it did kind of start with one
of my students. (chuckles)

1450
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:19,465
Madison.

1451
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:22,770
She was a troubled kid.

1452
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:27,107
Always messing up in school,
smoking weed in the bathroom

1453
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:30,177
and during lunch,
acting out in class.

1454
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,114
She was smart though, you know.

1455
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:35,849
We had a good relationship.

1456
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:40,120
She stopped by after class,
told me about her family,

1457
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:42,823
her whole life,
how lonely she was,

1458
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:46,026
how hated by everyone she was,

1459
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,295
bad friends, bad guys, you know,

1460
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:54,134
just teenage girl shit.
(chuckles)

1461
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:57,338
And I'd just make her laugh.

1462
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:03,077
Tell her she's the smartest
kid in class.

1463
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,917
Fucking one day, she had a
panic attack, band practice,

1464
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,086
started hyperventilating
into her French horn.

1465
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,839
She was like (imitating
manic horn playing).

1466
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:20,394
(Jason laughing)

1467
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:23,497
It was just like ridiculous,
you know?

1468
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,802
That's how I just, you know,

1469
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:30,504
I just offered her a ride home.

1470
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:38,078
And then.
(reflective music)

1471
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:41,015
Just happened.

1472
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:44,051
(reflective music)

1473
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,185
Back of the car.

1474
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,988
Side of the road.

1475
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:50,991
(reflective music)

1476
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,096
And then I drove her home.

1477
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,166
(reflective music)

1478
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:02,302
I think,

1479
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:05,572
she killed herself that night.

1480
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:09,076
[Sam] Okay, Jesus.

1481
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,629
[Ryan] That's a fucked up
story, man.

1482
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:14,148
(ominous music)
Oh shit.

1483
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:15,616
You gotta be kidding me.

1484
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:18,185
(laughing) You gotta be fucking.

1485
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:20,487
Oh man, hey, I'm sorry, man.

1486
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:22,056
Hey listen, you want some money

1487
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:23,366
to buy yourself back in
or something?

1488
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,559
'Cause like, I don't care.

1489
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:26,460
You know?

1490
01:00:26,493 --> 01:00:29,463
(ominous music)

1491
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:31,465
(Jason yelling)
(objects clanking)

1492
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:33,100
You fucking sick piece of shit!

1493
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:35,002
(body thuds)
You fucking sick motherfucker!

1494
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:37,404
I'll fucking kill you,
you fucking bitch!

1495
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:38,539
Get the fuck off me!

1496
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:40,074
Get the fuck off me!

1497
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:42,176
Fucking psycho,
you're fucking dead.

1498
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:43,510
You hear me?

1499
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:45,346
You're fucking dead, bitch!

1500
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:46,914
You're sick, you're sick!

1501
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:49,049
Get the fuck off me!
(Jason gagging)

1502
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,518
Guess what bitch, I got you!

1503
01:00:51,552 --> 01:00:53,887
I fucking got you!

1504
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:55,155
There was no Lizzie.

1505
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:56,156
That was me!

1506
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,459
You dumb cunt, I got you!

1507
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,428
I got chat logs and I got it
all on video.

1508
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:04,665
(video subtly whirring)

1509
01:01:04,698 --> 01:01:06,333
Please, please, I'm sorry.

1510
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:09,536
I'm drunk, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1511
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:10,570
Oh shit.

1512
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:18,011
Oh shit. (heavily panting)

1513
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,414
Oh shit.

1514
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:22,349
Please, please, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

1515
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:24,251
Just let me go.
- Oh, this is so fucked.

1516
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:25,328
Looked how fucked up he is!

1517
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:26,920
You almost killed him!

1518
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:29,089
Please, please, please,
please, let me go.

1519
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,624
This never happened, okay?

1520
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:31,558
It never happened. (sobbing)

1521
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:32,926
Shut the fuck up!

1522
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:35,229
Fuck.

1523
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:38,265
Fuck.
(camera breaks)

1524
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:39,933
I'm outta here man.

1525
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,044
Hey, hey, hey, what
are you talking about?

1526
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:42,002
Where the fuck are you going?

1527
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:42,703
Home, Benny!

1528
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:44,071
I want to go home!

1529
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:45,439
- Just hold the fuck on.
- No.

1530
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:46,473
You said it yourself.

1531
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:48,008
You can't hurt these guys.

1532
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,943
It's over, it's over,
you're fucked.

1533
01:01:49,977 --> 01:01:50,987
I don't want to be a part of it.

1534
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:52,146
You are a part of this.

1535
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:53,580
You're not fucking leaving!

1536
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:58,152
Just give a minute!
- Please please, please.

1537
01:01:58,185 --> 01:01:59,520
Please, I won't tell anybody.

1538
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,255
I won't tell anybody.

1539
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:02,556
That's bullshit, man.

1540
01:02:02,589 --> 01:02:03,701
He's gonna go straight
to the cops

1541
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,259
and spin some fucking sob story

1542
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,226
about how we mugged him
or some shit.

1543
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,228
Ryan, shut the fuck up!

1544
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:10,597
God, let's just fucking
take all of his shit,

1545
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:12,433
put a bag over his head,
roof him

1546
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:14,177
and drop him off in the
middle of the fucking dessert

1547
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:15,135
or something.

1548
01:02:15,169 --> 01:02:16,203
Are you fucking stupid?

1549
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:17,514
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1550
01:02:17,538 --> 01:02:19,473
I'm not the one who flipped out!

1551
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:21,208
No, we have to call the police.

1552
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,043
No, no, fuck that, Sam.

1553
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,045
Do you understand how
much shit I will be in?

1554
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:26,748
Yeah, no cops, no cops.

1555
01:02:26,781 --> 01:02:28,215
We took it too far.

1556
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,650
Benny fucked up.

1557
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:31,294
It's over,
I'm calling the fucking police.

1558
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:34,121
- Sam, give me this.
- Get the fuck off of me.

1559
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:35,154
Hey!

1560
01:02:36,223 --> 01:02:39,092
- Motherfucker, get back here.
- No, no, no, no, please.

1561
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:40,728
(body thuds)

1562
01:02:40,762 --> 01:02:44,331
Everybody stop! (panting)

1563
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:49,102
We're not calling the cops.

1564
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,740
We're not gonna drug and
kidnap him.

1565
01:02:52,774 --> 01:02:55,375
So what then? (panting)

1566
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,178
(Benny panting)

1567
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:01,783
We're gonna let him go.

1568
01:03:01,816 --> 01:03:04,184
- Are you fucking serious?
- What the fuck?

1569
01:03:04,218 --> 01:03:08,155
Do you really think he's
gonna go to the cops with this?

1570
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:10,123
Hey Mr. Officer,
these guys beat me up.

1571
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:11,124
Why, you ask?

1572
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:12,559
Oh, funny story.

1573
01:03:12,593 --> 01:03:13,560
I was trying to fuck
this 13-year-old girl.

1574
01:03:13,594 --> 01:03:15,295
So, we do it.

1575
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:18,065
Explain everything, deal
with the consequences.

1576
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,300
Is that really what you
want, Sam?

1577
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:22,636
You want the cops involved
in this?

1578
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:25,138
You wanna fuck up your
entire life,

1579
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:26,473
with a husband and kid?

1580
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:28,342
Oh, not to mention Ryan's
fucking life.

1581
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,744
We didn't even do anything.

1582
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:30,745
You didn't do anything?

1583
01:03:30,778 --> 01:03:32,346
Oh yeah, sure, come on.

1584
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,114
You really think you didn't
do anything?

1585
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:35,147
Fuck you.

1586
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:38,685
(pensive music)

1587
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:43,223
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1588
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:44,835
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Hey, shut the fuck up!

1589
01:03:44,859 --> 01:03:46,660
Shut the fuck up.

1590
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:49,396
Here's what you're gonna do.

1591
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:50,497
You're gonna go home.

1592
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:54,334
You're gonna tell your
family, you got too drunk.

1593
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:55,737
Got into some bar fight.

1594
01:03:56,637 --> 01:03:59,373
And then you're gonna take
a shower and go to bed.

1595
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:01,843
That's it.

1596
01:04:01,876 --> 01:04:04,712
You're not gonna do
something stupid, okay.

1597
01:04:04,746 --> 01:04:07,447
You're not gonna go to the
cops and ruin your life

1598
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:09,383
just because you got your
ass kicked.

1599
01:04:11,552 --> 01:04:13,520
This never happened.

1600
01:04:14,756 --> 01:04:16,323
And you're never gonna touch

1601
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:18,458
another fucking little girl
ever again.

1602
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,263
Uh huh, huh.

1603
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,735
Good, now get the fuck up

1604
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:29,771
and get the fuck out
of my house.

1605
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:42,282
(Jason sobs)

1606
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:53,292
Your coat.

1607
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,337
Hey!

1608
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:04,839
Benny, no!

1609
01:05:04,872 --> 01:05:09,543
(gun bangs)
(ominous music)

1610
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:12,279
(Ryan sighing)

1611
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:14,348
(Sam panting)

1612
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:17,150
(ominous music)

1613
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:21,823
Okay, it's okay.

1614
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:24,591
That's okay.

1615
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,426
You're okay.

1616
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,929
You're okay.
(ominous music)

1617
01:05:27,962 --> 01:05:30,297
- Oh fuck.
- You're okay.

1618
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,833
No, no, no,
this isn't happening.

1619
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,500
No, no, no, no.

1620
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:35,268
Benny,
why the fuck is she still here?

1621
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:36,637
Give me the gun!

1622
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,138
Put the phone down, Sam.

1623
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:41,408
Let her go.

1624
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:42,744
Now, Ryan!

1625
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:46,848
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry,
please, no.

1626
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:48,281
What are you doing here?

1627
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:50,852
How did you even get in here?

1628
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:51,853
I came in through the
window, I'm so sorry,

1629
01:05:51,886 --> 01:05:54,287
I did not mean. (sighs)

1630
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:58,893
(Sam hurls)
- Oh goddamn it.

1631
01:05:58,926 --> 01:06:01,294
Please, don't hurt me!

1632
01:06:01,328 --> 01:06:04,598
Okay, everyone just needs
to calm down.

1633
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:07,601
You just murdered someone
in cold blood!

1634
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:09,804
Should I just have let
him leave?

1635
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:11,304
You want him to go out there

1636
01:06:11,338 --> 01:06:12,382
and do this shit all over
again, huh?

1637
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:13,674
What was I supposed to do?

1638
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,342
Call the cops!

1639
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:16,744
That's not an option, okay.

1640
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,612
So shut the fuck up
about the cops!

1641
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:19,645
Fuck you!

1642
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:22,449
Benny, gimme the gun.

1643
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:24,251
(body thuds)
Oh, what the fuck?

1644
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:25,585
What the fuck, man?

1645
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:27,320
I told you,
we're not gonna kill her.

1646
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:28,866
You fucking asshole,
you broke my fucking nose!

1647
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:30,590
Shut up, shut the fuck up!

1648
01:06:30,624 --> 01:06:32,392
Shut up, all right, shut up!

1649
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:33,895
The two of you just need
to shut up

1650
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:36,964
and sit down for one
second, okay.

1651
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:38,766
Everything is gonna be fine.

1652
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,233
It's fine!

1653
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:41,769
I just need a minute!

1654
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:44,438
(tense music)

1655
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:48,542
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1656
01:06:48,575 --> 01:06:50,712
Hey, you're okay, you're okay.

1657
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:52,245
I got you, okay.

1658
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:53,680
You're safe, I got you.

1659
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:56,818
I got you, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

1660
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:57,861
You're okay.
(Nicole sobbing)

1661
01:06:57,885 --> 01:06:59,020
Hey, look at me.

1662
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:00,253
You're okay.

1663
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:01,588
I'm sorry about this.

1664
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:03,622
I am.

1665
01:07:04,726 --> 01:07:05,927
I didn't want this.

1666
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,563
This wasn't supposed to happen.

1667
01:07:09,596 --> 01:07:12,499
You coming back and being
here right now,

1668
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:15,569
I think that was supposed
to happen.

1669
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:19,040
It was, it's like destiny,
you know?

1670
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:20,640
What do you mean?

1671
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:22,744
You were at his house
before, right?

1672
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:24,578
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

1673
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:26,279
We're gonna go there
together, okay.

1674
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:28,015
What?

1675
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:30,484
He said, he saves all of his
conversations on hard drives.

1676
01:07:30,517 --> 01:07:31,351
Did you hear that part?

1677
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:32,987
I don't know.

1678
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,422
Okay, well the last
conversation he had was with me

1679
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:38,760
inviting him to this address
with your picture attached.

1680
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:43,363
Yeah, so we're gonna go
there together, okay.

1681
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:45,565
You and me, like as a team,
all right?

1682
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,835
You and me together, one unit.

1683
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,570
And we're gonna find those
hard drives

1684
01:07:50,604 --> 01:07:52,015
and we're gonna make
sure we get rid of them

1685
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:55,076
so no one knows he was
ever even here.

1686
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:57,011
And then it'll be over.

1687
01:07:57,044 --> 01:07:59,714
While we do that, Sam and Ryan
are gonna deal with the body.

1688
01:07:59,747 --> 01:08:01,983
- Are you fucking serious?
- Fuck that!

1689
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:04,351
Just shut the fuck up.

1690
01:08:08,122 --> 01:08:09,122
Hey.

1691
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,960
Do you understand what I'm
saying to you?

1692
01:08:12,994 --> 01:08:14,494
No.

1693
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:17,631
This is the right thing
to do, okay.

1694
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:20,101
This is the only thing to do.

1695
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:21,134
It's over.

1696
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:23,670
He's gone.

1697
01:08:23,703 --> 01:08:25,740
Now, we have to protect
ourselves

1698
01:08:27,108 --> 01:08:29,609
'cause we're not bad people.

1699
01:08:29,643 --> 01:08:31,879
We didn't do anything wrong.

1700
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:34,115
We just messed up a little bit.

1701
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:35,549
Benny, he's dead.

1702
01:08:35,582 --> 01:08:37,018
You killed him.
- I know, I know.

1703
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:39,619
I know, I know but it's
like Batman, right?

1704
01:08:39,653 --> 01:08:40,988
He never killed anyone, right?

1705
01:08:41,022 --> 01:08:42,556
Like not even his worst enemies.

1706
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:45,126
It was like his moral code
or whatever.

1707
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:46,928
Yeah.

1708
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:48,604
Well, wouldn't it have been
a lot better for everyone

1709
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:51,098
if he just went ahead
and killed the Joker?

1710
01:08:51,132 --> 01:08:53,567
Like the first time he had
the chance?

1711
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:56,570
Do this with me, okay.

1712
01:08:57,671 --> 01:08:58,739
Be my Robin.

1713
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:03,144
(Nicole sobs)

1714
01:09:03,177 --> 01:09:04,177
Okay.

1715
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:08,481
Okay, I'll help.
- Great, amazing.

1716
01:09:08,515 --> 01:09:10,650
It'll be quick and easy,
I promise.

1717
01:09:10,684 --> 01:09:12,485
No more bad stuff is
gonna happen.

1718
01:09:12,519 --> 01:09:14,421
Okay.

1719
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,099
Where the fuck are we
supposed to hide a body?

1720
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:17,624
Benny, please.

1721
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:20,094
Please, please,
just let me go home.

1722
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:23,496
Take my car out to
the middle of nowhere.

1723
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,632
This is just so insane.
(sobbing)

1724
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:27,534
I've got gloves and
bleach you can use

1725
01:09:27,567 --> 01:09:29,003
to clean up all this in here

1726
01:09:29,036 --> 01:09:31,404
and then you can move
the body into my car.

1727
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:35,475
There's a shovel and
flashlights outside.

1728
01:09:35,508 --> 01:09:36,508
Jesus Christ.

1729
01:09:37,544 --> 01:09:41,414
Take the 204, go past
the river and then bury him

1730
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:43,985
as deep as you can.

1731
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:45,652
You're not being serious,
are you?

1732
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:47,822
Yes, I am.

1733
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:52,193
Nicole and I will deal with
the hard drive, all right.

1734
01:09:52,226 --> 01:09:54,729
I'll take his car and
I'll hide it out back

1735
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:56,130
and I'll deal with it tomorrow.

1736
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:57,664
And that's the plan.

1737
01:09:57,697 --> 01:09:59,499
That's what we're going to do.

1738
01:09:59,532 --> 01:10:01,068
- No, it isn't.
- Sam.

1739
01:10:01,102 --> 01:10:04,105
You want me and Ryan to
bury the body

1740
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:06,107
of a guy that you killed?

1741
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,176
Sam, please, I fucking,
I need this.

1742
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,879
Do you realize how fucked
up that is?

1743
01:10:11,913 --> 01:10:14,547
Sam please, All right,
I'm, I'm...

1744
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,450
I'm sorry, I don't know,
I don't know.

1745
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:19,586
I, I love you.

1746
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:22,489
All right?

1747
01:10:22,522 --> 01:10:25,092
I'm not gonna spend the
rest of my life in prison.

1748
01:10:25,126 --> 01:10:26,593
Not for this.

1749
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:28,695
Sam, I need you to do
this for me.

1750
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:31,064
I'll do it.

1751
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:32,933
Sam?

1752
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:39,206
(Sam sobbing)
(pensive music)

1753
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:48,049
Fuck, fine, fine, fine.

1754
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:53,888
Great, the boys.

1755
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,092
All right, clean up in here.

1756
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,526
My car's out front.

1757
01:11:00,227 --> 01:11:01,528
Text me.

1758
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:02,897
Just keep me updated, you know,

1759
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:03,931
but nothing specific.

1760
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:05,532
I'll do the same.

1761
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:07,935
(hands clap)

1762
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:11,772
And throw this in
the river for me.

1763
01:11:12,707 --> 01:11:15,142
(Sam panting)

1764
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:18,946
I can't (mumbles).

1765
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,717
(indistinct chatter)

1766
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,121
He deserved to die.
(reflective music)

1767
01:11:27,154 --> 01:11:28,154
I know.

1768
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:32,026
(indistinct chatter)

1769
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:39,867
(keys jangle)

1770
01:11:41,235 --> 01:11:43,838
(Benny sighs)
(indistinct chatter)

1771
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,905
Ready to go?

1772
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:52,179
(phone ringing)

1773
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,081
Hey, Meg.

1774
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,584
Hey, sorry.

1775
01:11:57,617 --> 01:11:59,220
Sorry, sorry, yeah.

1776
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:00,287
I know.

1777
01:12:00,321 --> 01:12:03,124
Actually the, you know,

1778
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:07,028
I've kind of been talking to
the guy from CreepDunk, Benny.

1779
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:11,132
Yeah, he actually texted
me and he wanted to,

1780
01:12:11,165 --> 01:12:12,833
he wanted to meet up.

1781
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,971
So yeah, I know it's crazy.

1782
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:21,108
Yeah, so we've just been
hanging out.

1783
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:25,713
Yeah, no, he actually is.

1784
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:27,715
He actually is that tall.

1785
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:28,748
One second.

1786
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:33,187
Sorry.

1787
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,322
Yeah, he wants to meet you.

1788
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:38,192
So can we come over
for a minute?

1789
01:12:38,225 --> 01:12:39,626
We'll be super quiet.

1790
01:12:41,362 --> 01:12:43,998
He's even cuter in person.

1791
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,332
(Benny chuckles)

1792
01:12:45,366 --> 01:12:47,835
Great, yeah, okay, great, great.

1793
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,203
See you soon, bye.

1794
01:12:49,236 --> 01:12:50,237
Okay, that worked.

1795
01:12:50,271 --> 01:12:51,671
Yeah, she's a fan.

1796
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:53,040
I showed her your
videos earlier.

1797
01:12:53,074 --> 01:12:54,909
Oh, that's awesome.

1798
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:56,043
Can we listen to music?

1799
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:58,212
Because I'm kind of freaking out

1800
01:12:58,245 --> 01:12:59,980
and loud music always helps
me calm down.

1801
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:02,283
- Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
- Okay, thank you.

1802
01:13:02,316 --> 01:13:03,316
Just, ah.

1803
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:14,161
(punk rock music builds)

1804
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:15,229
Fuck!

1805
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:42,723
(sighs) Okay,
so we have to be quiet

1806
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:44,959
and obviously, act like
chill around Megan and stuff.

1807
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:46,227
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1808
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,294
Got it.

1809
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:48,829
Okay, let's go.

1810
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:56,003
Did you look at my picture?

1811
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,239
What?

1812
01:13:58,272 --> 01:14:00,141
The picture I sent
you, did you look at it?

1813
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:03,077
No, no, I just sent it
to him right away, I swear.

1814
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:05,746
It would've been okay if
you did look.

1815
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:06,779
I wouldn't mind.

1816
01:14:11,185 --> 01:14:12,019
(car door shuts)

1817
01:14:12,052 --> 01:14:13,921
(Benny sighs)

1818
01:14:13,954 --> 01:14:16,991
(crickets chirping)

1819
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:24,732
(car door closes)

1820
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,011
(door closes)

1821
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:39,780
(crickets chirping)

1822
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:45,119
(woman snoring)

1823
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:54,094
(light footsteps)

1824
01:14:57,031 --> 01:15:00,167
(light knocking)

1825
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:02,203
Hey, girl.

1826
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:03,404
You look amazing.

1827
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:04,405
Do I look older?

1828
01:15:04,438 --> 01:15:05,806
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1829
01:15:07,808 --> 01:15:10,044
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yeah, I'm good.

1830
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:11,445
I'm good.

1831
01:15:11,478 --> 01:15:13,180
I love how nervous you get
around boys.

1832
01:15:13,214 --> 01:15:14,215
It's so cute.

1833
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:16,016
Oh, yep, right? (laughs)

1834
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,885
(light knocking)
- Hey.

1835
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:20,888
I'm Benny, how's it going?

1836
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:22,756
It's good, I'm good.

1837
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:24,524
Nice.

1838
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:26,827
Thanks for having us over.

1839
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,162
Oh, yeah, totally.

1840
01:15:30,464 --> 01:15:32,399
And Nicole was showing
me your videos earlier.

1841
01:15:32,433 --> 01:15:33,834
They're so awesome.

1842
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:35,135
Nice, that's so cool.

1843
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:36,170
Thank you.

1844
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,838
This is so embarrassing,

1845
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,549
but I've literally been
watching them all night.

1846
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:41,308
I'm like addicted.

1847
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:43,377
Would you guys be down
like to just keep watching?

1848
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,248
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1849
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:48,515
That sounds good to me.

1850
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,984
Yeah, sure, whatever.

1851
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:51,852
- Oh, okay, yay.
- Great.

1852
01:15:55,956 --> 01:15:58,392
(door closes)

1853
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:05,298
Ready?

1854
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,300
Okay.

1855
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:09,168
One.

1856
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:11,204
Two.

1857
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:16,443
(body thuds)

1858
01:16:19,046 --> 01:16:21,382
Okay. (mumbles)

1859
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:23,851
We don't need to do this.
- Huh?

1860
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:26,186
What you talking about?
- We can leave him here,

1861
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,222
in the car with the gun

1862
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:31,158
and we can go home and deny
everything.

1863
01:16:31,191 --> 01:16:32,435
Fuck that, we're not doing that.

1864
01:16:32,459 --> 01:16:34,061
Help me find the fucking
flashlights.

1865
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:35,195
Ryan, Ryan.

1866
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,133
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, listen, okay!

1867
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,501
We didn't do anything,
all right.

1868
01:16:40,534 --> 01:16:41,969
What do we owe him?

1869
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:43,837
He's our fucking friend, Sam.

1870
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:46,540
Oh yeah, real, real fucking
friendly using us as props

1871
01:16:46,573 --> 01:16:48,242
so he can murder someone

1872
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:49,286
and then make us do the
dirty work afterwards.

1873
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,344
No, it's bullshit.

1874
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:51,621
Dude, he fucked up, all right?

1875
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:53,147
He was trying to do
the right thing.

1876
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,082
Was he?

1877
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,193
I mean, I wouldn't have shot
this guy in the fucking face,

1878
01:16:57,217 --> 01:17:00,154
but this is still like
a net positive, right?

1879
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:01,555
I have a kid at home, man.

1880
01:17:06,527 --> 01:17:09,029
I wanna see my baby.

1881
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:10,063
I wanna go home.

1882
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:15,002
I don't want, I don't
want to fucking do this.

1883
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:19,606
It's all good, man.

1884
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,275
It's chill, all right.

1885
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:23,188
It's gonna be fine, just
shut the fuck up, okay?

1886
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:24,677
Here we are.

1887
01:17:26,013 --> 01:17:27,223
We just gotta get through
this, okay.

1888
01:17:27,247 --> 01:17:28,248
We've just gotta do it.

1889
01:17:28,282 --> 01:17:29,650
(loud crashing)

1890
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:31,018
What the fuck was that?
- I dunno.

1891
01:17:31,051 --> 01:17:32,319
Give me the gun.

1892
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:33,487
No.

1893
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,521
Goddamn it.

1894
01:17:34,555 --> 01:17:37,191
(Sam panting)

1895
01:17:49,603 --> 01:17:54,641
Motherfucker!
(ominous music)

1896
01:17:55,442 --> 01:17:56,677
Oh my God.

1897
01:17:56,711 --> 01:17:59,480
(Sam and Ryan panting)

1898
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:02,282
(ominous music)

1899
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:14,628
(glass breaking)

1900
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:16,196
(person yells)

1901
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,232
(ominous music)

1902
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:20,968
(person moans)

1903
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:28,442
(glass breaking)

1904
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:31,111
(ominous music)

1905
01:18:31,145 --> 01:18:33,313
Holy fucking shit.

1906
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:38,385
(glass breaking)
(sinister music)

1907
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,423
(Jason yelps)
(ominous music)

1908
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:43,624
(Jason grunts)
(glass breaks)

1909
01:18:43,657 --> 01:18:46,493
(sinister music)

1910
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:51,198
(Jason grunts)
(glass breaks)

1911
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:54,067
(sinister music)

1912
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:58,439
(loud smacking)

1913
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:01,208
You guys have been
blowing my channel up!

1914
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,410
I can't believe you actually
dressed up.

1915
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:06,046
I know, I mean, this
guy, he was insistent

1916
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,415
on this weird Dungeons and
Dragons role play shit.

1917
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:11,018
So I figured it, fuck it,
let's just do it, you know?

1918
01:19:11,051 --> 01:19:12,352
Whoa.

1919
01:19:12,386 --> 01:19:14,488
He asked, fuck, my guy.

1920
01:19:15,456 --> 01:19:17,057
It looks like,

1921
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,301
did you literally stuff your
bra for this?

1922
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:20,694
Well, I am very method

1923
01:19:20,728 --> 01:19:22,296
and I'm technically

1924
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:23,741
supposed to be playing
a 14-year-old girl

1925
01:19:23,765 --> 01:19:25,265
and they stuff their
bras, right?

1926
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:26,768
Nicole did.

1927
01:19:26,801 --> 01:19:28,435
What the fuck, Megan?

1928
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:31,004
(laughing) Sorry, I
mean, you did do that.

1929
01:19:31,773 --> 01:19:33,974
Don't you have to go to
the bathroom?

1930
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:36,243
What?

1931
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:37,554
The whole way here you
were like,

1932
01:19:37,578 --> 01:19:39,012
I really have to use
the bathroom.

1933
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:40,681
There's a bathroom
down the hall.

1934
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:45,252
Yeah, God, I do need
to go to the bathroom.

1935
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:46,496
Is it okay if I use
your bathroom?

1936
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,188
- Yeah.
- Awesome, thank you.

1937
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:49,666
You guys should totally
check out the one

1938
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,025
where it's like stupid
old creep can't stand up.

1939
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:53,470
It's about the old guy in
the wheelchair.

1940
01:19:53,494 --> 01:19:55,996
It's so funny, okay.
- Okay, yes, we will.

1941
01:20:00,802 --> 01:20:02,102
Why are you being so weird?

1942
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,706
What, I'm not being weird.

1943
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:06,073
Yes, you are.

1944
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:07,508
You're being like
extremely weird.

1945
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,643
I'm not being weird.

1946
01:20:09,676 --> 01:20:12,446
Okay, he's a lot nicer
than I thought he would be.

1947
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,516
And you're right,
cuter in person.

1948
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:16,549
Yeah.

1949
01:20:17,785 --> 01:20:19,253
He's a good guy.

1950
01:20:19,286 --> 01:20:22,724
(tranquil ambient music)

1951
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:43,610
(door creaks, closes)

1952
01:20:43,644 --> 01:20:47,180
(tranquil ambient music)

1953
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:30,324
(drawer jiggling)

1954
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:51,411
(Benny sighs)

1955
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,445
Okay.

1956
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:57,583
One time.

1957
01:21:58,518 --> 01:22:00,822
(loud bang)

1958
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:15,502
(Sam sighs)
(Ryan's lips trilling)

1959
01:22:15,535 --> 01:22:17,180
Probably gonna take us
on mostly side streets

1960
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:18,672
until we hit the highway, yeah?

1961
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:21,775
Ryan?

1962
01:22:22,643 --> 01:22:23,945
Ryan?
- What, yeah?

1963
01:22:23,978 --> 01:22:25,254
You sure you're good to drive?

1964
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:26,748
Yeah, I'm chill.

1965
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:28,916
Just drive as like
safe as you can, okay.

1966
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,183
Sam, I got it, all right.

1967
01:22:30,217 --> 01:22:32,452
I'm fucking, I'm good, man.

1968
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:33,687
What's wrong, something wrong?

1969
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:34,722
- No, no, no.
- Right.

1970
01:22:34,756 --> 01:22:35,823
- You good?
- Yes.

1971
01:22:35,857 --> 01:22:36,967
If you're good then I'm good.

1972
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:38,458
But we have to fucking do this.

1973
01:22:38,492 --> 01:22:39,426
Okay, just gimme the directions.

1974
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:40,594
Go out and take a left.

1975
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:43,898
(engine revving)

1976
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:45,565
What's taking him so long?

1977
01:22:45,599 --> 01:22:47,601
I don't know, he's
probably taking a shit.

1978
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:48,770
Ew, in my house?

1979
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:50,671
I don't know, Megan.

1980
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:51,749
So what's up with you guys?

1981
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:53,941
Are you like a thing?

1982
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:55,542
What?

1983
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:57,244
What the hell, no.

1984
01:22:57,277 --> 01:22:58,889
Okay, so would you be
like super pissed off

1985
01:22:58,913 --> 01:23:00,213
if I hooked up with him?

1986
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:01,648
Megan?

1987
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:03,517
What?

1988
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,495
I just feel like he and I are
getting along really well.

1989
01:23:05,519 --> 01:23:06,562
I didn't want to like, step
on your toes or anything.

1990
01:23:06,586 --> 01:23:08,455
Megan, he would never do that.

1991
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:10,557
(scoffs) Okay, wow.

1992
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:11,926
- No, no, no.
- Never mind.

1993
01:23:11,959 --> 01:23:14,361
That's not what I meant.
I just mean,

1994
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:16,731
Megan, we've literally
been spending all night

1995
01:23:16,764 --> 01:23:18,532
watching videos of him,

1996
01:23:18,565 --> 01:23:20,376
catching predators who are
trying to sleep with kids.

1997
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,535
I'm not a fucking kid!

1998
01:23:21,568 --> 01:23:22,937
Megan, you're underage!

1999
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:25,439
Barely, like literally barely!

2000
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:37,384
(Benny exhaling)

2001
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:44,224
(light tapping)

2002
01:24:00,074 --> 01:24:02,977
(gentle whirring)

2003
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:12,720
(pensive music)

2004
01:24:12,754 --> 01:24:13,587
(light clicking)

2005
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:16,456
(pensive music)

2006
01:24:17,091 --> 01:24:19,359
(engine revving)
- Ryan, Jesus.

2007
01:24:19,392 --> 01:24:20,828
Ryan, slow down.
- Sorry, sorry.

2008
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:22,864
It's all right, Jesus.

2009
01:24:24,031 --> 01:24:29,269
Oh God, okay.
(suspenseful music)

2010
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:34,075
(engine revving)

2011
01:24:34,108 --> 01:24:37,511
(suspenseful music)

2012
01:24:37,544 --> 01:24:38,378
What?

2013
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:39,781
What is it?

2014
01:24:39,814 --> 01:24:41,716
It's nothing, just
focus on the road, okay.

2015
01:24:41,749 --> 01:24:43,583
You're gonna take a left here.

2016
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,788
(engine revving)

2017
01:24:46,821 --> 01:24:48,790
(pensive music)

2018
01:24:48,823 --> 01:24:51,625
(engine revving)

2019
01:24:56,696 --> 01:24:59,533
(pensive music)

2020
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,600
Okay, um,

2021
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:04,471
Ryan, don't freak out.
- What?

2022
01:25:04,504 --> 01:25:05,682
Don't say fucking shit
like right now.

2023
01:25:05,706 --> 01:25:07,340
- Ryan, Ryan.
- What is it?

2024
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,409
I think someone might be
following us.

2025
01:25:10,577 --> 01:25:11,922
[Ryan] Oh fuck you,
nobody's following us.

2026
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:13,422
Yeah, I'm probably just
being paranoid.

2027
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:14,381
Are you being serious right now?

2028
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:15,817
I don't know, okay.

2029
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,027
This guy's just been
behind us for a while.

2030
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:18,131
- For how long?
- Since, um.

2031
01:25:19,086 --> 01:25:21,388
Since we left Benny's.
- Since we left Benny's!

2032
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:22,790
Are you fucking kidding me,

2033
01:25:22,824 --> 01:25:23,690
of course,
they're fucking following us.

2034
01:25:23,724 --> 01:25:24,759
Okay, calm down.

2035
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:25,869
Why the fuck should I be calm?

2036
01:25:25,893 --> 01:25:27,627
Who the fuck is following us?

2037
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:28,772
Okay, look, dude, we're
in Benny's car, okay, okay.

2038
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:30,064
So I think,

2039
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:32,867
I think it might be a cop.
- What?

2040
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,601
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2041
01:25:34,634 --> 01:25:35,712
[Sam] With all the shit
that Benny's been through,

2042
01:25:35,736 --> 01:25:36,847
maybe they put a tail on him.

2043
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:37,915
No, no, no, no, no, no, fuck!

2044
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:38,706
I'm on fucking parole, here.

2045
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:40,373
(engine revving)

2046
01:25:40,407 --> 01:25:41,976
How am I being unfair?

2047
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:43,020
Megan, it's literally math.

2048
01:25:43,044 --> 01:25:44,879
He is 26 and you're 15.

2049
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:46,479
God, okay,

2050
01:25:46,513 --> 01:25:48,025
so then why the fuck did
you bring him over then?

2051
01:25:48,049 --> 01:25:49,092
Because I thought that
you would think it was cool

2052
01:25:49,116 --> 01:25:50,584
'cause you like his videos.

2053
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:52,720
I like his videos
because he's hot.

2054
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:53,864
I thought you'd bring him over

2055
01:25:53,888 --> 01:25:54,856
so we'd like do stuff with him.

2056
01:25:54,889 --> 01:25:55,957
That's fucking crazy!

2057
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:58,759
(intense music)

2058
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:10,570
Ryan, don't drive crazy, okay.

2059
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:12,405
We can't get pulled over
right now.

2060
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:13,540
No, no fucking way, man.

2061
01:26:13,573 --> 01:26:14,608
No fucking way!

2062
01:26:14,641 --> 01:26:16,010
Ryan, I need you to calm down.

2063
01:26:16,043 --> 01:26:17,778
Okay, we can still lose him.

2064
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:20,781
Just take a right.
(engine revving)

2065
01:26:20,815 --> 01:26:21,825
[Ryan] Are they still there?

2066
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,450
Left.

2067
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:24,627
(engine revving)
- Uh, what the fuck?

2068
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:26,187
What the fuck is happening?

2069
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,998
I don't get why you're
being such a bitch about this

2070
01:26:28,022 --> 01:26:30,457
when you clearly have
feelings for him too, Nicole.

2071
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:32,559
You're literally obsessed
with the guy.

2072
01:26:32,592 --> 01:26:34,128
You talk about him all the time.

2073
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:36,998
You're in love with him.
- Shut up, Megan!

2074
01:26:37,031 --> 01:26:38,565
(intense music)

2075
01:26:38,598 --> 01:26:41,135
(light tapping)

2076
01:26:42,837 --> 01:26:43,947
Okay, now speed down this alley.

2077
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:45,172
- But you just said!
- Do it!

2078
01:26:45,206 --> 01:26:49,476
(engine revving)
(tires screeching)

2079
01:26:49,509 --> 01:26:54,447
(sighs) Okay,
that ought to do it.

2080
01:26:54,481 --> 01:26:56,083
Shit man, fuck that!

2081
01:26:56,117 --> 01:26:59,519
(suspenseful music)

2082
01:26:59,552 --> 01:27:01,688
Okay, um, okay, stop.

2083
01:27:01,722 --> 01:27:02,990
Just keep going down

2084
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:04,491
all the way to the end of
this alley.

2085
01:27:04,524 --> 01:27:06,660
Make a left.
- Okay.

2086
01:27:06,693 --> 01:27:07,938
And then we'll get
back on track.

2087
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:10,731
(intense music)

2088
01:27:11,665 --> 01:27:14,668
(Ryan sobbing)

2089
01:27:14,701 --> 01:27:15,701
Ryan.

2090
01:27:16,636 --> 01:27:18,571
(light tapping)
Ryan, we're good, we're good.

2091
01:27:18,605 --> 01:27:19,941
Okay.

2092
01:27:19,974 --> 01:27:21,641
God, this is a fucking
nightmare, man.

2093
01:27:21,675 --> 01:27:22,575
Yeah, no shit.

2094
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:25,179
(intense music)

2095
01:27:34,554 --> 01:27:36,857
Oh come on.
- Yeah, let's go.

2096
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:41,028
(suspenseful music)

2097
01:27:56,143 --> 01:27:58,980
- Same car?
- Maybe, I don't know.

2098
01:27:59,013 --> 01:28:01,782
(intense music)

2099
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:04,051
Just drive, now.

2100
01:28:04,085 --> 01:28:05,528
(Sam and Ryan yelling)
(tires screeching)

2101
01:28:05,552 --> 01:28:07,088
He does not like me like that!

2102
01:28:07,121 --> 01:28:08,631
So you think he just
likes that you're a big fan?

2103
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:10,024
What are you even talking about?

2104
01:28:10,057 --> 01:28:12,059
He clearly wants to have
sex with you.

2105
01:28:12,093 --> 01:28:13,660
No, he doesn't!

2106
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:15,205
Why else would he
talk to you all the time

2107
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:16,297
and hang out with you?

2108
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,932
Because he thinks I'm cool

2109
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:19,867
and he wants to make videos
with me, okay.

2110
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,534
He likes me.

2111
01:28:21,568 --> 01:28:22,837
You're so dumb.

2112
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,238
That is so dumb.

2113
01:28:24,271 --> 01:28:26,140
No, it's not!

2114
01:28:26,173 --> 01:28:29,076
Look, he came here tonight
because he wants to get laid.

2115
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:32,612
I'm sorry, you're too much of
a virgin to understand that.

2116
01:28:32,645 --> 01:28:34,982
You are such a fucking bitch!

2117
01:28:35,016 --> 01:28:40,054
(intense music)
(light clicking)

2118
01:28:42,023 --> 01:28:45,159
(car revving)
- What the fuck should I do?

2119
01:28:45,192 --> 01:28:46,827
Okay, hold on.

2120
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:48,295
(grunts) I'm going on
the freeway.

2121
01:28:48,329 --> 01:28:49,830
(engine revving)

2122
01:28:49,864 --> 01:28:50,765
Ah!

2123
01:28:50,798 --> 01:28:52,233
Oh man, if he was a cop,

2124
01:28:52,266 --> 01:28:54,035
he would have fucking
pulled me over by now.

2125
01:28:54,068 --> 01:28:55,169
Who the fuck is this guy?

2126
01:28:55,202 --> 01:28:57,171
God, this can't be happening?

2127
01:28:57,204 --> 01:28:58,839
You do not know Benny, okay!

2128
01:28:58,873 --> 01:29:01,075
You do not know what kinda
a person he is!

2129
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:03,144
He's just a boy, Nicole.

2130
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:04,078
I know enough.

2131
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:05,780
No, you fucking don't!

2132
01:29:05,813 --> 01:29:06,857
You didn't even know who
your own father was, okay!

2133
01:29:06,881 --> 01:29:08,315
Or maybe you did,

2134
01:29:08,349 --> 01:29:10,127
and you were too scared
to do anything about it.

2135
01:29:10,151 --> 01:29:11,728
Nicole stop, what the
fuck are you talking about?

2136
01:29:11,752 --> 01:29:15,356
Your dad is a fucking
child molester.

2137
01:29:15,389 --> 01:29:16,724
What?

2138
01:29:16,757 --> 01:29:18,893
What are you saying?

2139
01:29:18,926 --> 01:29:20,660
You're being fucking
insane right now.

2140
01:29:20,693 --> 01:29:21,628
No, I'm not.

2141
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:23,030
Your dad is a predator

2142
01:29:23,064 --> 01:29:24,965
and Benny did something
about it, okay,

2143
01:29:24,999 --> 01:29:27,700
because he cares about people
and he wants to protect them.

2144
01:29:27,735 --> 01:29:29,136
Did what, Nicole?

2145
01:29:30,738 --> 01:29:31,939
Nicole, what did he do?

2146
01:29:33,074 --> 01:29:34,607
Did he do something to my dad?

2147
01:29:34,641 --> 01:29:36,077
Where is he?

2148
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:38,012
Where the fuck is my dad,
Nicole?

2149
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:40,647
What did he do?

2150
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,717
(loud banging)

2151
01:29:43,751 --> 01:29:44,852
Oh, shit.

2152
01:29:44,885 --> 01:29:47,654
(intense music)

2153
01:29:51,358 --> 01:29:54,795
Hey, what the hell are
you girls screaming about?

2154
01:29:56,897 --> 01:29:58,332
Jason?

2155
01:29:58,365 --> 01:29:59,867
Uh.

2156
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,011
Who is that,
who the hell are you?

2157
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:02,245
I'm just a friend of Megan's.

2158
01:30:02,269 --> 01:30:04,939
He's dead, Benny killed him.

2159
01:30:04,972 --> 01:30:06,140
What?

2160
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:08,375
(intense music)

2161
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:10,044
Oh, no.

2162
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:12,113
What are you saying?

2163
01:30:12,146 --> 01:30:13,814
We needed to do it, okay.

2164
01:30:15,049 --> 01:30:16,417
No, tell me, tell me your lying.

2165
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:18,219
(intense music)

2166
01:30:18,252 --> 01:30:19,920
Tell me you're fucking
lying to me.

2167
01:30:19,954 --> 01:30:21,755
(engine revving)

2168
01:30:21,789 --> 01:30:22,890
No, fuck this!

2169
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:23,858
(brakes screeching)

2170
01:30:23,891 --> 01:30:25,192
What are you doing?

2171
01:30:25,226 --> 01:30:26,369
I'm gonna see what this
asshole wants.

2172
01:30:26,393 --> 01:30:27,995
Gimme the gun.
- No, fuck.

2173
01:30:28,028 --> 01:30:29,272
- Sam, I'm not fucking around!
- All right.

2174
01:30:29,296 --> 01:30:30,030
What are you doing in my house?

2175
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:32,199
Uh.

2176
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:34,135
Answer me, who the fuck are you?

2177
01:30:34,168 --> 01:30:35,970
Uh, oh...

2178
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:37,238
- Megan?
- No, no, no.

2179
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:38,973
Megan,
there's a man in our house.

2180
01:30:39,006 --> 01:30:40,283
No, no, no, it's not like that.

2181
01:30:40,307 --> 01:30:41,775
I can explain.

2182
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:42,743
- Sam, gimme the gun!
- Ryan, no!

2183
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:44,778
(grunts) Fuck this.

2184
01:30:44,812 --> 01:30:46,280
Yo, motherfucker!

2185
01:30:46,313 --> 01:30:47,781
Why the fuck are you
following us?

2186
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:50,384
(intense music)

2187
01:30:52,953 --> 01:30:53,787
(car door closes)

2188
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:55,022
(intense music)

2189
01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:56,357
Who the fuck are you?

2190
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:59,193
(intense music)

2191
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:01,428
(gun bangs)
- Fuck.

2192
01:31:01,462 --> 01:31:03,364
We did it to protect you, okay.

2193
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:05,232
(Megan scoffs)
I promise, I swear.

2194
01:31:05,266 --> 01:31:07,968
- Mom!
- What is going on?

2195
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:09,904
They killed him,
they killed dad.

2196
01:31:09,937 --> 01:31:10,981
Okay, I am calling the cops.

2197
01:31:11,005 --> 01:31:12,249
No, no, no, no, Terry, please.

2198
01:31:12,273 --> 01:31:13,140
Megan!

2199
01:31:13,174 --> 01:31:15,943
(intense music)

2200
01:31:16,877 --> 01:31:20,047
(Sam murmuring)

2201
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,291
- Terry, Terry, please don't.
- Megan, give me your phone.

2202
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:22,149
No, please don't.

2203
01:31:22,183 --> 01:31:23,184
Terry, no!

2204
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:25,986
(intense music)

2205
01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:29,056
(body thuds)

2206
01:31:29,089 --> 01:31:32,293
(intense music)

2207
01:31:32,326 --> 01:31:34,828
(gun bangs)

2208
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:45,839
It's just a matter of time now.

2209
01:31:45,873 --> 01:31:48,442
I mean, how fucking long
does it take to dig a...

2210
01:31:53,948 --> 01:31:55,449
You okay, you good?

2211
01:31:58,919 --> 01:31:59,954
They'll be back soon.

2212
01:31:59,987 --> 01:32:01,789
They'll be back really soon.

2213
01:32:01,822 --> 01:32:02,890
And then we'll go.

2214
01:32:02,923 --> 01:32:04,925
And all this will be over.

2215
01:32:04,959 --> 01:32:07,962
- Why, what is?
- (exhales) Okay.

2216
01:32:07,995 --> 01:32:09,139
All right.
- What is happening?

2217
01:32:09,163 --> 01:32:10,497
Hey, hey, hey.

2218
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:13,434
Talk to me, okay?

2219
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:15,469
What do you want?

2220
01:32:15,502 --> 01:32:17,104
I don't want anything.

2221
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:22,343
I just need you to listen,
okay. Can you do that for me?

2222
01:32:22,376 --> 01:32:23,978
Stop, stop, stop.

2223
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:25,980
Don't do that, okay?

2224
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:30,951
Terry, your husband, Jason,

2225
01:32:30,985 --> 01:32:32,486
is a child molester.

2226
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:36,090
He has hard drives upstairs
in his office

2227
01:32:36,123 --> 01:32:40,828
full of conversations he's had
with multiple underage girls.

2228
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:44,365
No, no, that is bullshit.

2229
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:46,800
That is bullshit.
- It's not.

2230
01:32:46,834 --> 01:32:48,569
I'm not lying to you, okay.

2231
01:32:48,602 --> 01:32:50,271
I was one of them.

2232
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,040
I pretended to be
a 13-year-old girl

2233
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:55,309
and he asked me for nudes.

2234
01:32:55,342 --> 01:32:56,410
Okay, this isn't fake.

2235
01:32:56,443 --> 01:32:57,978
This is very real.

2236
01:32:58,012 --> 01:32:59,556
I need you to understand
that this is real.

2237
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:03,317
No, please just let us go.

2238
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:05,452
Please, please let us go.

2239
01:33:08,355 --> 01:33:12,293
Last night, I was making a
video, trying to expose him,

2240
01:33:12,326 --> 01:33:16,196
trying to stop him from doing
any more terrible things.

2241
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:20,401
Things got a little out of hand.

2242
01:33:21,635 --> 01:33:23,837
And he,

2243
01:33:25,472 --> 01:33:26,573
is,

2244
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:30,277
he is dead.
- What, dead?

2245
01:33:31,512 --> 01:33:34,481
What the fuck,
what are you talking about?

2246
01:33:34,515 --> 01:33:37,084
- Okay.
- What is going on?

2247
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:39,953
No, why are you doing
this to us?

2248
01:33:41,522 --> 01:33:44,525
Why did you do this?
- Okay, stop, stop, stop!

2249
01:33:44,558 --> 01:33:45,592
- No!
- Stop!

2250
01:33:48,228 --> 01:33:49,530
It's okay.
- No.

2251
01:33:49,563 --> 01:33:52,266
It's okay.
(light patting)

2252
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:54,401
Why? (sobbing)

2253
01:33:54,435 --> 01:33:56,203
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2254
01:33:56,236 --> 01:33:57,504
(Terry sobbing)
I know.

2255
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:00,441
Listen to me.

2256
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:04,011
Jason was a horrible,
awful man, okay.

2257
01:34:04,044 --> 01:34:05,479
He was a monster.

2258
01:34:05,512 --> 01:34:08,082
I know, you know this deep down.

2259
01:34:08,115 --> 01:34:09,116
He's dead now.

2260
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:10,884
He's gone and we're here.

2261
01:34:11,618 --> 01:34:16,056
And I need you to listen
to me very carefully, okay?

2262
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:18,525
Some people are burying his
body in the middle of nowhere,

2263
01:34:18,559 --> 01:34:20,227
as we speak.

2264
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,072
When they're done, they're
gonna give me a call

2265
01:34:22,096 --> 01:34:23,263
and we're gonna leave.

2266
01:34:24,164 --> 01:34:26,100
After we've left,
after a few hours,

2267
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:28,969
you're gonna call the police
and report him missing.

2268
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:30,537
Do you understand?

2269
01:34:30,571 --> 01:34:32,406
Are you crazy?

2270
01:34:32,439 --> 01:34:34,508
I'm gonna call the fucking
police on you.

2271
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:36,210
You're going to prison!

2272
01:34:36,243 --> 01:34:38,078
Do you really want to do that?

2273
01:34:38,112 --> 01:34:39,246
Think about it for a second.

2274
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:41,148
Think about it for a second.

2275
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:44,685
Do you really want the world
to see this?

2276
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,121
You want everyone to
know what happened here?

2277
01:34:47,154 --> 01:34:48,922
Do you really want that,

2278
01:34:49,623 --> 01:34:52,326
to know who your husband
truly was?

2279
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:55,095
Do you even understand what
that would mean for you?

2280
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:57,598
Do you know what happens
to the wives of predators?

2281
01:35:08,509 --> 01:35:11,044
So in a few hours,
when we leave,

2282
01:35:11,078 --> 01:35:12,212
what are you gonna do?

2283
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:14,046
Call the police.

2284
01:35:15,015 --> 01:35:16,015
And?

2285
01:35:18,652 --> 01:35:20,053
Report him missing.

2286
01:35:21,288 --> 01:35:24,091
(hands clap) Yes!

2287
01:35:24,124 --> 01:35:25,392
Thank you, thank you.

2288
01:35:25,426 --> 01:35:26,728
Beautiful. (lips smacking)

2289
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:29,029
I love you, I love ya,
seriously.

2290
01:35:29,062 --> 01:35:30,097
You're a gem.

2291
01:35:31,031 --> 01:35:32,366
Okay, do you hear that?

2292
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:35,335
Everything's gonna be okay.
(laughing)

2293
01:35:35,369 --> 01:35:36,537
Everything's fine.

2294
01:35:37,471 --> 01:35:38,740
Okay, everything's good.

2295
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:40,708
How we doing, seriously,
how are we doing?

2296
01:35:41,743 --> 01:35:42,743
Okay.

2297
01:35:45,379 --> 01:35:46,647
Where the fuck are they?

2298
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,248
I mean, how long does it
fucking take?

2299
01:35:50,184 --> 01:35:51,118
Is anybody hungry?

2300
01:35:51,151 --> 01:35:52,319
I am fucking starving.

2301
01:35:52,352 --> 01:35:53,687
(Megan grunts)

2302
01:35:53,721 --> 01:35:54,555
Okay, that's one.

2303
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:55,588
Nicole?

2304
01:35:57,658 --> 01:35:58,992
I'll make something.

2305
01:35:59,026 --> 01:36:00,127
Oh my God, thank you.

2306
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,462
I love you.

2307
01:36:01,495 --> 01:36:03,163
Literally,
anything will be perfect.

2308
01:36:03,197 --> 01:36:07,067
Like, cereal will be fine.
(hands clap)

2309
01:36:09,236 --> 01:36:10,370
Call me right now!

2310
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:18,212
Okay, what are we gonna
do? Let's, let's watch TV!

2311
01:36:18,245 --> 01:36:19,112
Okay, let's watch TV.

2312
01:36:19,146 --> 01:36:20,180
Everyone loves TV.

2313
01:36:20,214 --> 01:36:21,448
Okay, TV on.

2314
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:24,551
Commercials, boo.

2315
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:26,220
No, no commercials.

2316
01:36:26,253 --> 01:36:28,055
We hate commercials.

2317
01:36:28,088 --> 01:36:30,224
- Those are the things-
- I was backstage and it was-

2318
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:31,358
(dramatic music)

2319
01:36:31,391 --> 01:36:32,493
Good morning, everyone.

2320
01:36:32,526 --> 01:36:33,795
I'm Karen Thomas.

2321
01:36:33,828 --> 01:36:36,230
Good morning Karen,
I'm Paul Cooper.

2322
01:36:36,263 --> 01:36:37,799
First this morning,

2323
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:39,777
Sheriff Margaret Harvey
has issued a clear warning

2324
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:41,435
to the young man responsible

2325
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:43,670
for a series of vigilante
style YouTube videos.

2326
01:36:43,704 --> 01:36:46,440
- Holy shit.
- This has to stop.

2327
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:47,742
[Karen] Thank you, Paul.

2328
01:36:47,775 --> 01:36:49,510
Morning news.
- It's my interview.

2329
01:36:49,543 --> 01:36:51,154
Correspondent Hannah
Morgan had a chance to speak

2330
01:36:51,178 --> 01:36:54,481
with this individual and
got his thoughts in just-

2331
01:36:54,515 --> 01:36:55,658
Oh my God, that's,
they're talking about me.

2332
01:36:55,682 --> 01:36:57,651
Holy shit, this is insane.

2333
01:36:57,684 --> 01:37:02,189
(man yelling)
- His name is Benjamin Jansen.

2334
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,624
His YouTube channel is called-

2335
01:37:03,657 --> 01:37:05,192
This is fucking crazy.

2336
01:37:05,225 --> 01:37:10,264
(faint TV chatter)
(suspenseful music)

2337
01:37:29,283 --> 01:37:31,652
Nicole, Nicole,
come back in here!

2338
01:37:31,685 --> 01:37:33,287
You have to see this!

2339
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,664
[Woman On TV] Her foot
down, saying this is-

2340
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:39,660
(faint TV chatter)
(suspenseful music)

2341
01:37:48,502 --> 01:37:50,704
No, that's dead wrong!

2342
01:37:50,738 --> 01:37:53,340
Literally every single person

2343
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:56,610
that gets charged with my
evidence gets convicted.

2344
01:37:56,643 --> 01:37:59,646
Convicted,
that's 100% conviction rate.

2345
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,381
What the fuck!

2346
01:38:01,415 --> 01:38:03,192
My evidence is good. Why
would you want to hide them?

2347
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:04,627
[Hannah] I'm not
hiding anything, are you?

2348
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:06,329
Whoa, Hannah, I didn't
realize you were gonna be

2349
01:38:06,353 --> 01:38:07,789
so feisty in real life,
I love it.

2350
01:38:07,822 --> 01:38:09,299
Wow, I look pretty good,
I look built, damn.

2351
01:38:09,323 --> 01:38:11,391
Cases can't be properly
prosecuted-

2352
01:38:11,425 --> 01:38:14,227
I'm wearing my spy glasses,
which looks stupid, but.

2353
01:38:15,228 --> 01:38:16,463
Other than than, Jesus.

2354
01:38:16,496 --> 01:38:17,741
[Reporter] On camera as a means

2355
01:38:17,765 --> 01:38:18,809
of acquiring identifying
information.

2356
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:22,770
No, no, no, what the fuck!

2357
01:38:22,804 --> 01:38:24,705
What the fuck!

2358
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:26,673
This is fucking bullshit!

2359
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,342
This is all out of context.

2360
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:30,210
They're literally fucking
everything up!

2361
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:31,779
This is so fucked!

2362
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,515
Oh fuck you, Hannah Morgan.

2363
01:38:35,549 --> 01:38:37,226
[Reporter] Recently, a
case involving a predator-

2364
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:39,821
(phone ringing)
Oh my God.

2365
01:38:39,854 --> 01:38:41,455
It's Sam, it's Sam.

2366
01:38:41,488 --> 01:38:42,790
Mute the TV, mute the TV.

2367
01:38:42,824 --> 01:38:45,258
Holy shit, thank you God,
thank you God.

2368
01:38:46,493 --> 01:38:47,694
Sam, talk to me.

2369
01:38:47,729 --> 01:38:48,562
What's going on?

2370
01:38:48,595 --> 01:38:49,696
How are you?

2371
01:38:49,731 --> 01:38:51,365
Why weren't you in your car?

2372
01:38:52,432 --> 01:38:53,432
[Benny] Sam?

2373
01:38:55,535 --> 01:38:58,238
Hello?
(Tim panting)

2374
01:38:58,271 --> 01:39:01,274
Hello?
(camera clicking)

2375
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:02,476
Who the fuck is this?

2376
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:05,747
(Tim panting)

2377
01:39:07,749 --> 01:39:09,717
You know,
this was supposed to be easy.

2378
01:39:09,751 --> 01:39:11,218
It was supposed to be you.

2379
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:11,853
Why did you have to
fuck this up?

2380
01:39:11,886 --> 01:39:13,353
Where's Sam?

2381
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:15,255
What did you do with
Sam and Ryan?

2382
01:39:15,288 --> 01:39:16,523
Benny, what's going on?

2383
01:39:16,556 --> 01:39:18,191
(intense music)
- Shh.

2384
01:39:18,225 --> 01:39:19,727
I didn't want to kill
him, Benny.

2385
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:21,729
I just.

2386
01:39:21,763 --> 01:39:23,597
I can't let you ruin my life.

2387
01:39:25,365 --> 01:39:26,433
I'm not gonna let you.

2388
01:39:27,668 --> 01:39:30,537
Oh, so you're fucking tough now?

2389
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,606
Now that we're talking
over the phone, is that it?

2390
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:33,908
Uh huh.

2391
01:39:33,941 --> 01:39:35,375
Do you know what they do to guys

2392
01:39:35,409 --> 01:39:36,849
who fuck little girls in
prison, huh?

2393
01:39:37,444 --> 01:39:38,813
I have your laptop.

2394
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:40,447
It's all gone, Benny.

2395
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,481
I deleted everything.

2396
01:39:41,515 --> 01:39:43,517
Chat logs.

2397
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:44,852
Videos.

2398
01:39:46,721 --> 01:39:50,390
You're about to get a text
from yourself.

2399
01:39:50,424 --> 01:39:53,493
(intense music)

2400
01:39:53,527 --> 01:39:54,361
(notification beeping)

2401
01:39:54,394 --> 01:39:57,230
(intense music)

2402
01:40:00,701 --> 01:40:01,701
Oh fuck.

2403
01:40:02,636 --> 01:40:04,271
Fuck!

2404
01:40:04,304 --> 01:40:05,605
Fuck!

2405
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:08,241
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

2406
01:40:08,275 --> 01:40:11,846
Fuck, goddamn it. (screams)

2407
01:40:11,879 --> 01:40:15,750
No, oh fuck. (sobbing)

2408
01:40:15,783 --> 01:40:17,785
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

2409
01:40:19,352 --> 01:40:20,755
What do you want, huh?

2410
01:40:20,788 --> 01:40:21,789
Why are you doing this?

2411
01:40:21,823 --> 01:40:24,391
Why are you calling me?

2412
01:40:24,424 --> 01:40:26,426
I dunno know.

2413
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,627
In your house for a while now

2414
01:40:27,661 --> 01:40:29,396
trying to figure out what to do.

2415
01:40:30,697 --> 01:40:32,967
It's such a fucking mess.

2416
01:40:34,334 --> 01:40:36,603
(grunts) This whole thing.

2417
01:40:36,636 --> 01:40:39,406
(intense music)

2418
01:40:40,574 --> 01:40:42,710
(drags body)

2419
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:45,512
(Tim panting)

2420
01:40:45,545 --> 01:40:49,549
I was gonna kill you when
you came back.

2421
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:50,961
But then I clicked one of
your videos.

2422
01:40:50,985 --> 01:40:53,620
(Tim panting)

2423
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:02,829
I like 'em.

2424
01:41:03,831 --> 01:41:06,366
I like what you do to people.

2425
01:41:08,002 --> 01:41:10,704
I watched every video you
on your channel tonight.

2426
01:41:12,807 --> 01:41:13,908
(car door closes)
Today.

2427
01:41:16,978 --> 01:41:17,978
I'm sorry.

2428
01:41:19,646 --> 01:41:20,748
I gotta go.

2429
01:41:20,782 --> 01:41:22,616
I gotta call the cops now.

2430
01:41:22,649 --> 01:41:24,384
No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait.

2431
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:26,653
I have something you want, okay.

2432
01:41:26,686 --> 01:41:28,321
I have a girl, a young girl.

2433
01:41:28,355 --> 01:41:29,398
I can literally bring
her to you right now.

2434
01:41:29,422 --> 01:41:30,457
Benny!

2435
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,993
Shh.

2436
01:41:32,026 --> 01:41:34,561
All right, she's literally,
she's tied up right now.

2437
01:41:34,594 --> 01:41:35,730
I'll send you a photo.

2438
01:41:35,763 --> 01:41:36,630
You're gonna love her.

2439
01:41:36,663 --> 01:41:39,000
(intense music)

2440
01:41:39,033 --> 01:41:40,935
Nicole, Jesus Christ,

2441
01:41:40,968 --> 01:41:43,037
I'm not gonna actually
fucking do it, okay.

2442
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:44,538
I'm gonna use her as bait.

2443
01:41:44,571 --> 01:41:46,707
What the hell does that mean?

2444
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:48,075
It means.
(camera clicks)

2445
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:49,543
I'm going to kill him.

2446
01:41:50,912 --> 01:41:51,879
Okay, I'm back, I'm back.

2447
01:41:51,913 --> 01:41:52,914
Did you get it?

2448
01:41:52,947 --> 01:41:53,981
She's cute, right?

2449
01:41:54,015 --> 01:41:55,058
She's hot, she's really hot.

2450
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:56,683
She can be a fucking model.

2451
01:41:56,717 --> 01:41:58,052
She's young, I swear.

2452
01:41:58,085 --> 01:41:59,129
It's hard to tell with all
the makeup,

2453
01:41:59,153 --> 01:42:00,788
but she's young, I promise.

2454
01:42:01,889 --> 01:42:03,456
Hello?

2455
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:04,490
Hello?

2456
01:42:05,059 --> 01:42:06,493
Are you there?

2457
01:42:06,526 --> 01:42:07,995
Fuck!
(phone bangs)

2458
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:11,464
(warped ominous music)

2459
01:42:17,805 --> 01:42:19,740
Wait, whoa, whoa.

2460
01:42:19,774 --> 01:42:20,775
Unmute the TV.

2461
01:42:20,808 --> 01:42:22,409
Nicole, unmute that.

2462
01:42:26,646 --> 01:42:28,648
Always worked hard in class.

2463
01:42:28,682 --> 01:42:29,917
I think you can actually tell

2464
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:31,786
he works hard on his
videos, too.

2465
01:42:33,855 --> 01:42:35,355
I think you can tell.

2466
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:38,425
To be fair,
he was a very troubled kid.

2467
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,029
Sometimes he would
practically kick the door in

2468
01:42:42,063 --> 01:42:43,064
on his way in.

2469
01:42:44,799 --> 01:42:46,067
And I'd say, you know,

2470
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,535
Benny, are we gonna have
a good day today?

2471
01:42:48,568 --> 01:42:52,139
And he'd say, I don't
know what he would say.

2472
01:42:52,173 --> 01:42:53,941
He always had some sort
of comeback.

2473
01:42:53,975 --> 01:42:58,980
And then on other days it
was just zip,

2474
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,414
total silence,

2475
01:43:01,448 --> 01:43:05,186
turtle mode, I call it
when my students, anyway.

2476
01:43:05,219 --> 01:43:07,822
