00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,280
Pika.

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,360
Pi.

3
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
Pikachu.

4
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,560
Well, Pikachu, we're here.

5
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,520
lt's a Pokémon paradise.

6
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,720
-This looks like tons of fun.
-Yeah, the Pokémon love it.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,720
Just keep your eye on
Togepi, okay, Pikachu?

8
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
Come on, come on, come on

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,280
Let's go

10
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
Vacation, need a little sun

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm going to get my friends
together and have a little fun

12
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,680
Ain't nobody going to
tell us what we going to do

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because today it's up to me and you

14
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
Temptation calling out to me

15
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
A little relaxation I'll be free to be

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,560
Come on and wicky-wicky lou

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,200
I do believe it'll start now

18
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Kick it back to the track

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Vacation's where I want to be

20
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Buddy on the beach
where the fun is free

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,960
We don't need a holiday
to start to celebrate

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,040
Repeat after me: I need a vacation

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,520
Let's go

24
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,840
Vacation's where I want to be

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Buddy on the beach
where the fun is free

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
We don't need a holiday
to start to celebrate

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,640
Because I need a break,
I need a vacation

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,880
Vacation's where I want to be

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Buddy on the beach
where the fun is free

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
Pokédex observation unit
now activating.

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,440
My function: Monitor
Pokémon activity...

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,080
...to understand behavioral
patterns of the Pokémon...

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,040
...when they are in a state
of total relaxation.

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,560
Togepi, the Egg Pokémon.

35
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,640
It exhibits a low
tolerance for hunger.

36
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,360
It is able to communicate this
condition in a very effective manner.

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
Pika, Pika. Pikachu.

38
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Squirt.

39
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,040
Bulbasaur

42
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,920
Bulba, bulba

43
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Bulbasaur

44
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,800
This is the first known recording
of ''Bulbasaur's Bulbabye. ''

45
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Bellsprout.

46
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,560
Bellsprout.

47
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,120
Activating Pokémon database.

48
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,880
Snubble, a newly discovered Pokémon.

49
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,160
A Ground-type Pokémon, Cubone.

50
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
Cubone-bone-bone.
Cubone-bone-bone-bone.

51
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,400

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,400
-Squirtle.
-Bulbasaur.

57
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,720
Pokémon do not battle unless
directed by their trainers.

58
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,800
Translation activated.

59
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,760
''Let's set a good example
for the baby. ''

60
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,840

61
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,920
Togepi.

62
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,560
Slooooooooow.

63
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,200
Pokémon enjoy competition,
but not always in Pokémon battles.

64
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,640
It's not uncommon for Pokémon to
challenge each other in contests.

65
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Oh come on, try to catch me

66
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,960
Oh catch me if you can

67
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,440
Oh come on, try to catch me

68
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,560
Oh catch me if you can

69
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
-Exeggutor.
-Oddish.

70
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,040
-Exeggutor.
-Oddish.

71
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,440
Pikachu and Raichu are both
Mouse Pokémon of the electric variety.

72
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,520
Combined voltage approaching
shockingly dangerous levels.

73
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
This is the perfect place
for a comfy catnap.

74
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
What's that?

75
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,640
What's the rush?

76
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,680
Farfetch'd, Farfetch'd....

77
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,880
Hitmonlee.

78
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,080
Chansey, Chansey.

79
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,800
lKeep it down!

80
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,440
Mag.

81
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,680
Magne. Ma.

82
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,760
Magnemites!

83
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,360
Cubone earned its classification
as the Lonely Pokémon...

84
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,440
...from its usual attitude
of caring only...

85
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,280
...for itself.

86
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
l told you to keep quiet!

87
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,640
Well, this ought to
shut you all up, you--

88
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,520
Duck.

89
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,840
l think l'll take my nap right here.

90
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,440
Good night.

91
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,560
Preliminary analysis: Pokémon,
by nature, are friendly creatures...

92
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,160
...and prefer cooperation
to confrontation.

93
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,560
Final conclusion:

94
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,720
Despite earlier uncertainties...

95
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,880
...Pokémon vacations are
highly recommended.

96
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,760
Pokédex observation unit
now deactivating.

97
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,960
Pikachu, it's time to leave!

98
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,760
Goldeen! Staryu! Psyduck!
Come on back!

99
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,200
Geodude! Onix! Zubat!
Vulpix! We got to go!

100
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,640
Did you have fun?

101
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,960
Life.

102
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,840
The great miracle and
the great mystery.

103
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
Who am I?

104
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,040
Since the beginning...

105
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,440
...humans and Pokémon alike
have searched for its meaning.

106
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,600
What am I? What am I?

107
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,120
Many strange and wondrous
legends evolved...

108
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,560
...from the pursuit
of life's mysteries.

109
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,800
Where am I? Where am I?

110
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,120
But none is stranger
than this tale...

111
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,160
...of the most powerful
Pokémon of all.

112
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,560
I am ready...

113
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,280
...to be, to be....

114
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
Where...

115
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
...am I?

116
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,440
This is not the same.

117
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,400
Was everything before just a dream?

118
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,840
Why?

119
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,600
-Doctor, look at this.
-What?

120
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,680
lts brain waves, they're surging!

121
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,160
-Let me see!
-She's right!

122
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,400
-Let's run another scan.
-lts mind is racing!

123
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,080
Those voices.

124
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,680
l hope we don't lose this one!

125
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,080
They're outside.

126
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,400
We can't!

127
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,280
Where I must be.

128
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,920
Tell Giovanni what's happened!

129
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
Quiet!

130
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,240
Let us hear its psychic powers.

131
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,480
Psychic powers?

132
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,720
For years we struggled to successfully
clone a Pokémon to prove our theories.

133
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,720
You're the first specimen to survive!

134
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,680
That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokémon.

135
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,760
From its DNA we created you, Mewtwo.

136
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,680
Mewtwo?

137
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Am l only a copy?
Nothing but Mew's shadow?

138
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,880
You are greater than Mew.

139
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,640
lmproved through the power
of human ingenuity.

140
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,440
We used the most advanced techniques
to develop your psychic powers.

141
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,920
So l am simply the end
result of your experiment.

142
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,520
What becomes of me now?

143
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,240
Our experiment isn't over!
lt's just beginning!

144
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,320
Now the serious testing begins.

145
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,040
These humans, they care
nothing for me.

146
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,280
Congratulations. We've
done an excellent job.

147
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,520
-We'll observe Mewtwo for mutations.
-ls the new tank ready?

148
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,240
We'll have to come up
with a cage for it.

149
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,800
Excellent. We'll start testing.

150
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,600
Is that my purpose?

151
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,080
Am Ijust an experiment?

152
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,840
A laboratory specimen?

153
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,920
This cannot be my destiny!

154
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,280
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon...

155
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,520
...and we succeeded.

156
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
Behold my powers.

157
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,680
l am the strongest Pokémon in the world.

158
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,960
Stronger even than Mew.

159
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,920
Those fools thought you
were a science experiment...

160
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,120
...but l see you as
a valuable partner.

161
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,840
Partner?

162
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,000
With your psychic powers
and my resources...

163
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,920
...together we can control the world.

164
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,720
l do not need your help
for that, human.

165
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,240
A wildfire destroys
everything in its path.

166
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,440
lt will be the same with your
powers unless you control them.

167
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,440
l can help you do that.

168
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,320
How?

169
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,840
l'll show you a way
to focus your powers...

170
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,520
...that will make you invincible.

171
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,440
Show me!

172
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,680
You say this armor protects my body...

173
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,800
...yet it suppresses my powers!

174
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,120
Your powers are not being
suppressed. They're being focused.

175
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,840
Learn to use them to
accomplish your purpose.

176
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,600
What is that?

177
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,320
Patience, my friend. Your
purpose will become clear.

178
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,640
So this is my power.

179
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,240
l am in control now.

180
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,440
Alakazam!

181
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,040
lKazam!

182
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,320
But why am l here?

183
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,080
Now l fully perceive my power.

184
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,880
But what is my purpose?

185
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,080
To serve your master.
You were created to fight for me.

186
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,440
That is your purpose.

187
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,840
That cannot be.

188
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,360
You said we were partners.
We stood as equals.

189
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,520
You were created by humans
to obey humans.

190
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,280
You could never be our equal.

191
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,240
Humans may have created me...

192
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,440
...but they will never enslave me.

193
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,520
This cannot be my destiny!

194
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,680
Stop this now!

195
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,400
l was not born a Pokémon!
l was created.

196
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,520
My creators have used and betrayed me.

197
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,640
So l stand alone.

198
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,120
Who am l?

199
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,880
What is my true reason for being?

200
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,320
l will find my own purpose.

201
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,400
And purge this planet
of all who oppose me.

202
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,480
Human and Pokémon alike.

203
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,400
The world will heed my warning.

204
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,640
The reign of Mewtwo will soon begin.

205
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,520
Today, Ash, Brock and Misty are taking
a break from their Pokémon adventures.

206
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,240
As always, Ash is determined
to become a Pokémon master.

207
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,680
And, as always, he's ready to endure
any hardship, bear any burden...

208
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,320
...with strength, stamina
and a will of steel.

209
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
Hungry. Need food.

210
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,480
Oh, Ash! You haven't
done a thing all day!

211
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,280
l'm too weak to work, Misty.

212
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,680
l haven't eaten since breakfast.

213
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,040
This lunch is going to
be just perfect for you.

214
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,480
lt's my lazy-boy ''no-chew'' stew.

215
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,720
You there! l'm looking for a Pokémon
trainer named Ash from Pallet Town.

216
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,560
-You know him?
-Yeah, he's me.

217
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,760
Let's have a match.
Unless you're afraid to lose!

218
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,440
l'm afraid you're going
to lose this one!

219
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Ash, you just said you
were too weak to work!

220
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,360
l am too weak to work, but
a Pokémon battle isn't work!

221
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,320
That's progress. At least
his mouth is working.

222
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,520
I want to be the very best

223
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,800
Like no one ever was

224
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,560
To catch them is my real test

225
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,800
To train them is my cause

226
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,160
I will travel across the land

227
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,280
Searching far and wide

228
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,320
Teach Pokémon to understand

229
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,920
The power that's inside

230
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Inside Pokémon

231
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,880
It's you and me

232
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,200
I know it's my destiny

233
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,880
You're my best friend

234
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,040
And the world we must defend

235
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,880
Our hearts are true

236
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,360
Our courage will pull us through

237
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,720
You teach me and I'll teach you

238
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,040
Pokémon

239
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,520
Got to catch them,
got to catch them all

240
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Great job, Bulbasaur! You did it!

241
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,680
You can challenge along the way

242
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,200
Encourage our faith

243
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,800
I will battle everything

244
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,000
About the place

245
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,320
Come with me, the time is right

246
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,240
There's no better team

247
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,080
Arm in arm we'll win the fight

248
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,600
It's always been our dream

249
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,400
It's you and me

250
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,920
I know it's my destiny

251
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,960
You are my best friend

252
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
In a world we must defend

253
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,920
A heart so true

254
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,080
Our courage will pull us through

255
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,080
You teach me and I'll teach you

256
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
Got to catch them

257
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,680
Got to catch them all

258
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,800
We did it!

259
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,480
Well, that sure was a shocking ending.

260
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,240
Shocking that Ash moved so fast.

261
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,520
Another credit on Pikachu's
''charge account!''

262
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,480
We've got to grab it!

263
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,000
l know we must grab rare
Pokémon for the Boss...

264
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,920
...but it wouldn't be a bad idea
if we grabbed a bite to eat.

265
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,640
We didn't come here to steal a meal!

266
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,040
l'd settle for a taste
of that Pika-chow.

267
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
l'm starving.

268
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,240
l can cook something.

269
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,880
The last time you cooked, you
wiped out eight of my nine lives.

270
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,120
Master, shall l extend an
invitation to these trainers as well?

271
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,920
As you wish.

272
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,040
Watch where you're flying.

273
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,920
Something for me?

274
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,640
Greetings, Pokémon trainers.
I bear an invitation.

275
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,640
She's really small,
but really pretty!

276
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,080
You've been chosen to join a group of
Pokémon trainers at a gathering.

277
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,120
It will be hosted by my master, the
world's greatest Pokémon trainer...

278
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,760
...at his palace on New Island.

279
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,120
A ferry will leave Old Shore Wharf...

280
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,120
...to take you to the island
this afternoon.

281
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,720
Only trainers with this
invitation will be admitted.

282
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,200
If you decide to attend,
you must reply at once.

283
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,560
My master awaits you.

284
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,080
ls there a rewind button?

285
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,480
-Should we go?
-Of course! l've got to meet her!

286
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,920
l guess the world's number-one trainer
wants to challenge me to a match!

287
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,520
-We've got to let him know right away.
-l'm saying yes!

288
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:00,280
What's so special about
the twerp trio's special delivery?

289
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,440
Hey, look!

290
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,920
''Yes''? To what?

291
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,480
Raticate!

292
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,920
Chill out, Raticate!

293
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,520
lKingler! Save your energy!

294
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,200
This is going to be so cool!

295
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,200
Officer Jenny, report to
the ferry entrance.

296
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,160
Officer Jenny to
the ferry entrance.

297
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Togepi's totally soaked!

298
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,440
l can't believe how
fast the storm came up.

299
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,520
What?! The ferry is canceled?!

300
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,120
But l've got to get to New lsland!

301
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,560
-lt's only a little rain!
-lt's more than just rain.

302
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,040
The harbor manager thinks
this could be the worst storm ever.

303
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
Listen to me.

304
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,600
The prophets have predicted
the return of the Winds of Water.

305
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,400
For years...

306
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,840
...l prayed mankind would never
witness that deadly storm ever again.

307
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,280
lsn't that just a legend?

308
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,880
Ancient writings tell of the storm
wiping out all but a few Pokémon.

309
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,680
ln their sorrow...

310
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,720
...the water of their tears restored
the lives lost in the storm.

311
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,560
But there are no Pokémon tears today.

312
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,160
Just waters which no one can survive.

313
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,960
That's why the ferry
has been canceled.

314
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,440
l'm going to New lsland anyway!
All my Pokémon are Water-type!

315
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,400
We'll just swim over to that palace!

316
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,240
l warn you, the waves will
be savage! You will never make it!

317
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,200
lf you try that stunt and
your Pokémon got hurt...

318
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,880
...you'd be out of luck because
we closed the Pokémon Center.

319
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,480
How come?

320
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,640
The nurse in charge of
the center disappeared last month.

321
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,840
lf any of you see her,
please contact me at once.

322
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,440
That's a picture of her
over there on the wall.

323
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,120
She's cute.

324
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,280
She sure looks familiar.

325
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,280
Come back here, or
l'll place you under arrest!

326
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,840
Come back!

327
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,280
Some trainers have no fear.

328
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,360
To them, this is just
one more challenge.

329
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,800
They follow their hearts.

330
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,000
That is what sets them apart
and will make them Pokémon masters.

331
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,160
Good luck to all of you.

332
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,000
The world's greatest Pokémon
master is waiting for me.

333
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,280
Let's use our Pokémon
to get to that island.

334
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,720
Our Pokémon aren't strong enough.
They can't handle waves like this.

335
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,320
Guess you're right.

336
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,120
You vant to cross maybe?
Ve take you?

337
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,720
Ve Vikings are used to big vaves.

338
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,400
Ve get you to New lsland faster
than you can say fahrvergnügen.

339
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,400
Stroke!

340
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,880
Stroke!

341
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,840
Stroke! Stroke!

342
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,800
l think l'm going to have one.

343
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,240
-l didn't know Vikings still existed.
-They mostly live in Minnesota.

344
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,920
Something's not right.
Are you sure this boat's safe?

345
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,720
Don't vorry. This ship
von't let you down.

346
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,880
Ve alvays sail in da
rough veather. Don't get upset.

347
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,240
Tell my stomach.

348
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,000
Heave! Heave! Heave!

349
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,920
lt's all right, Togepi.
We're going to be okay.

350
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,720
-Those aren't Vikings.
-lt's Team Rocket.

351
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,800
l knew there was something fishy
about them besides the smell!

352
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,720
-Prepare for trouble.
-Make it double.

353
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,840
Forget the motto.
We're going to have to....

354
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Ash! Misty!

355
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,160
-Have you seen Ash and Pikachu?
-Not yet.

356
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Stay together. lt's our only hope.

357
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,320
Look!

358
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,600
My master bids you
welcome to New lsland.

359
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,360
lKindly present your invitation.

360
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,480
Here it is, miss.

361
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,120
The bearers of this invitation may
be admitted.

362
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,200
l knew l recognized that face.

363
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,920
What?

364
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,440
Aren't you the nurse
from the treatment center?

365
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,960
You do look just like her.

366
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,920
l fear you are mistaken.

367
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,360
l've always dwelt on this island
and been in the service of my master.

368
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,640
Please, come this way.

369
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,760
My master awaits your arrival.

370
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,680
With you here, all trainers...

371
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,640
...worthy of an audience with
my master are present.

372
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,080
There's only three of them.

373
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,880
Aren't we waiting for the others?

374
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,960
Only the trainers capable
of braving the storm...

375
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,640
...are worthy in my master's eyes.

376
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,320
Do you mean that storm
was some kind of test?

377
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:23,080
Release your Pokémon from
their Pokéballs and join the others.

378
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,920
lt won't be long before
my master's intentions are clear.

379
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,200
Now we'll never know what
kind of party we're missing!

380
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,840
We'll just have to crash that party.

381
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,120
-You know another way in?
-Look over there.

382
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,760
But how are we going
to swim up that thing?

383
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,520
Pretend you're a catfish.

384
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,560
-Something wrong, Jessie?
-No. Come on. Let's get going.

385
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,880
l think this plan's all wet.

386
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,480
Psy-ya-ya duck.

387
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,080
What took you guys so long?

388
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,600
How did you get here?

389
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,400
l decided to fly over.
lt was easy.

390
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,320
Hurricane winds are
a breeze for Pidgeotto here.

391
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,680
Guys, say hello.

392
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,160
Those are my Pokémon.

393
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,560
lt was no problem
getting through that storm.

394
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,320
l rode over on Gyarados' back.

395
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,320
l heard it takes a lot
of skill to train Gyarados.

396
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,720
Yes, but once you train it, it's
the most dependable Pokémon there is.

397
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,640
You haven't met my
Pokémon. Over there.

398
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,240
You are about to meet my master.

399
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,120
The time has come to encounter
the greatest Pokémon master on Earth.

400
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,680
What's that?

401
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,000
Yes. The world's greatest
Pokémon master...

402
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,640
...is also the most
powerful Pokémon on Earth.

403
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,760
This is the ruler of New lsland
and soon the whole world.

404
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,280
Mewtwo.

405
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,680
Mewtwo.

406
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,440
A Pokémon can't be
a Pokémon master! No way!

407
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,000
Quiet, human. From now on,
l am the one who makes the rules.

408
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,880
-How's it talking?
-lt's psychic.

409
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,120
We'll show you! Let's go, Gyarados!

410
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,000
Gyarados, Hyper-Beam attack!

411
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,960
Gyarados!

412
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,080
Child's play.

413
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,440
Your usefulness has ended.

414
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,760
Nurse Joy!

415
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,280
Where am l? And how
in the world did l get here?

416
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,320
You have been under my control.

417
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,880
l transported you here
from the Pokémon center.

418
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,400
Your knowledge of Pokémon
physiology proved useful to my plan.

419
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:22,080
l have cleansed your tiny human
brain of memories from the past weeks.

420
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,680
Who are you?!

421
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,440
l am the new ruler of this world...

422
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,880
...the master of humans
and Pokémon alike.

423
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,200
You're just a bully!

424
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,880
Look at these.

425
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,360
They're Pokémon.

426
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,120
Are they real?

427
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,400
l was hoping there'd be a party.

428
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,200
This is the Pokémon replication
system. System activated.

429
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,920
Pokémon based on genetic analysis.

430
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:58,280
Pokémon DNA sampling
sequence now in progress.

431
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,880
Put me down.

432
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,280
What are you--? Let go!

433
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,280
-Help!
-Grab him!

434
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,200
Help me!

435
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,720
l made it. But just by a hair.

436
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,120
Look, there's your hair.

437
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,080
Analyzing Pokémon biomaterial sample.

438
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,960
Analysis complete.
Pokémon identified.

439
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,480
Begin replication sequence.

440
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,480
-Who's that Pokémon?
-lt's Meowth.

441
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,360
Meowth!

442
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,800
But l'm Meowth.

443
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,880
-So is the one in the tank.
-Your clone.

444
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,280
I haven't got much time.

445
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,960
I pray this record of
our experiment survives.

446
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,560
A year ago we discovered...

447
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,680
...the remains of
the ancient Pokémon, Mew.

448
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,360
There was sufficient
genetic material to replicate Mew.

449
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,680
Giovanni insisted on super-clones...

450
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,920
...more powerful than
any living Pokémon.

451
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,800
Finally our experiments
proved successful.

452
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,240
We produced a living Pokémon.
We called it Mewtwo.

453
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,080
But the creature's anger
is out of control.

454
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,600
With its psychic powers,
it's destroying our laboratory.

455
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,120
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon...

456
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,800
...and we succeeded.

457
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,920
-Sounds like a real Pokénstein.
-Sure does.

458
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,000
One bad cat!

459
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,480
So this must be the lab.

460
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,280
But if Mewtwo destroyed it....

461
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,720
-Somebody rebuilt it.
-Yes, but who?

462
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,720
You humans are a dangerous species.

463
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,640
You brought me into your world
with no purpose but to be your slave.

464
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,120
But now l have my own purpose.

465
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,440
My storm will create my own world...

466
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,040
...by destroying yours.

467
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:41,480
So you hate all humans? And you're
going to destroy us to save Pokémon.

468
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,360
No.

469
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,120
Your Pokémon will not be spared.

470
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,480
They have disgraced
themselves by serving humans.

471
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,720
Those Pokémon are nothing but slaves.

472
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,200
So, you say l am wrong?

473
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,080
You are not this human's servant?
You are his friend?

474
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,520
You are as pathetic as the rest.

475
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,960
Humans and Pokémon
can never be friends.

476
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,640
Are you okay?

477
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,600
Don't pick on Pikachu.

478
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,040
lf you are Pokémon, there's
no reason l can't capture you.

479
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,800
Go, Rhyhorn.

480
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,560
-No! Rhyhorn!
-Fools!

481
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,960
Your Pokémon attacks cannot
weaken me. My powers are too great.

482
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,520
No trainer can conquer me.

483
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,560
You won't mind proving it
in a real match!

484
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,640
ls that a challenge?

485
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,360
You bet it is!

486
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,960
They're awake!

487
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,760
Blast.

488
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,600
Saur.

489
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,360
-l'm scared.
-Me too.

490
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,520
Like most Pokémon trainers...

491
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,640
...l too began with Charmander,
Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

492
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,800
But for their evolved forms...

493
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,320
...l used their genetic material
to clone even more powerful copies.

494
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,360
-Copies!
-They're clones.

495
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,440
A stadium! Mewtwo
planned this all along.

496
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,160
Your fake Venusaur
can't beat my real one!

497
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,920
Right, Bruteroot?

498
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,640
We'll blow away that Blastoise,
won't we Shellshocker?!

499
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,400
lt may not have a nickname,
but l do have a Charizard.

500
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,760
l choose you!

501
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,880
Charizard, l didn't say start.

502
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,520
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

503
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,800
Which of you will oppose me first?

504
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,440
Saur.

505
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:08,400
l underestimated you last time,
but that won't happen again!

506
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,560
Go, Bruteroot! Razor Leaf!

507
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,440
Vine Whip.

508
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,240
Bruteroot!

509
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,480
lt looks like l'm up.

510
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,400
Go, Shellshocker!

511
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,200
Blastoise.

512
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,760
Blast.

513
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,920
Shellshocker, Hydro Pump!

514
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,320
Shellshocker!

515
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,840
You better forfeit, Ash.
Those clones are too powerful.

516
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,360
l'm not giving up.

517
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:35,000
Charizard, use your speed,
not power, and you'll win.

518
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,080
All right, go!

519
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,600
-Can't Charizard move any quicker?
-The clone is too fast.

520
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,280
-Charizard's in trouble!
-Finish it.

521
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,280
No, Charizard! No!
Are you okay?

522
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,200
As the victor, l now claim my prize:

523
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,200
Your Pokémon.

524
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,280
Wait!

525
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,080
What will you do with those Pokémon?!

526
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,640
l will extract their DNA
to make clones for myself.

527
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,720
They will remain safe
on this island...

528
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,560
...while my storm destroys the planet.

529
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,160
You can't do this!

530
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,080
Yes, Mewtwo! We won't let you!

531
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,760
Do not attempt to defy me.

532
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,840
This is my world now.

533
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,920
Let's go!

534
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,440
Gyarados!

535
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,560
l know!

536
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,000
Mewtwo can't catch them
if they're inside their Pokéballs.

537
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,680
Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!

538
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,560
lt's no use.

539
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:56,960
lt's futile to try
and escape my power.

540
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,080
Never mind the Pokéballs.
Carry them away!

541
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,360
Give back my Psyduck!

542
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,320
Vulpix!

543
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,080
Run, Pikachu!

544
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,600
lKeep running, Pikachu!

545
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,000
You're not going to get Pikachu!

546
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,200
There goes Alakazam.

547
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,160
Dewgong.

548
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,120
Vileplume.

549
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,360
Sandshrew. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.

550
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,120
But me, l got a special
place in my tail for this one.

551
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,080
Look there!

552
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,480
l don't have time for
your dumb motto today.

553
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,160
Who's that Pokémon? lt's Pikachu!

554
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,480
Let go! Stupid machine.

555
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,080
Give me back my Pikachu!

556
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,720
What's happening?

557
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,520
l'm so glad you're okay.

558
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,280
The copies are hatching!

559
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:25,480
-They're fabulous fakes!
-Send in the clones!

560
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,680
But where are the real ones?

561
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:38,360
-l wonder if they feel....
-Clonesome?

562
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,360
The Poké originals!

563
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,600
Squirtle's back!

564
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,200
You're all okay!

565
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,840
Humans, you have served my purpose.

566
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,320
l am sparing your lives,
for the moment.

567
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,440
But you cannot escape your fate.

568
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,880
The hour of my vengeance draws near.

569
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,520
Behold!

570
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,360
With Pokémon and humans eliminated...

571
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,320
...the clones shall inherit the world.

572
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,920
You can't do this. l won't let you.

573
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,520
-lt's Ash!
-All right!

574
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,080
-Psyduck!
-Vulpix!

575
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,360
lt is useless to challenge me.

576
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:21,120
lt's not going to end like this,
Mewtwo. We won't let it.

577
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,720
You're mine!

578
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,560
-Ash, no!
-Look out!

579
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,480
What?

580
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,480
Can it be?

581
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,800
-What is that?
-l don't know.

582
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,600
Mew. So finally we meet.

583
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,280
l may have been
cloned from your DNA...

584
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,760
...but l will prove that Mewtwo
is better than the original.

585
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,200
Superior to Mew.

586
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,320
Mew and Mewtwo!

587
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,720
So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew.

588
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,160
This world is too small for two of us.

589
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,880
Why do you flee from me?

590
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:27,480
Are you afraid to
find out which of us is greater?

591
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:12,240
So you do have some fight in you.

592
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:18,200
But l have no time for games.
Destiny is at hand.

593
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:22,880
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?

594
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:28,200
Or your pathetic group
of spineless inferior Pokémon?

595
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:34,120
We were created with powers
far stronger than the originals.

596
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,160
-Mew's got a good point.
-What's it saying?

597
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:49,360
You don't prove anything by
showing off a lot of special powers.

598
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,120
And that a Pokémon's
real strength comes from the heart.

599
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,520
My clones don't need
their powers to prove their worth.

600
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,960
l will block all the Pokémon's
special abilities...

601
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,200
...using my psychic powers.

602
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,080
Now we shall see who triumphs. Go!

603
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:37,080
Pokémon aren't meant to fight.
Not like this.

604
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:42,120
lt's useless.
What can come out of it?

605
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,560
Nothing but pain.

606
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:51,080
Can't Mewtwo understand it's
not right to force Pokémon to battle?

607
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,920
They're all living creatures.

608
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,920
This just proves
that fighting is wrong.

609
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,240
l was prepared for trouble,
but not for this.

610
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,600
Make that double for me.

611
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,440
Now l can see how
horrible fighting really is.

612
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:16,760
Even the best of friends
will fight sometimes.

613
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,760
l'll promise never to
fight again if you will.

614
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,760
What am l doing?

615
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,880
Let's get something straight!

616
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,680
You-owth ain't pushing Meowth around.

617
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,120
You mean, we don't have
to fight with each other?

618
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,600
But how can l trust you?
You was born different.

619
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:00,280
l almost made a clawful mistake.

620
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,640
How do l know you're not
going to pull a fast one on me?

621
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:12,880
You're right, we
do have a lot in common.

622
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:18,320
The same earth, the
same air, the same sky.

623
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:23,480
Maybe if we started
looking at what's the same...

624
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,160
...instead of always looking at
what's different, who knows?

625
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,320
Quit it! Please, stop!

626
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,600
Are you okay?

627
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,480
We got to stop this.

628
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,680
How? Mewtwo wants to prove
how strong those super-clones are.

629
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,960
l'd rather risk my life
out in Mewtwo's storm...

630
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,280
...than watch Pokémon
destroy each other.

631
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,280
Me too.

632
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:45,160
l wish there were some way to
stop them. l don't know what to do.

633
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,120
l don't think they'll ever stop.

634
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,160
Those Pokémon are ready
to fight to the death.

635
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,960
That's a fight that
nobody's going to win.

636
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,280
Someone's got to take a stand.

637
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,200
Someone's got to say no
and refuse to fight.

638
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,200
Just like Pikachu.

639
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,640
Ash, wait!

640
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:31,160
You've got to stop right now!

641
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,880
Stop!!

642
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,880
Oh, no!

643
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:55,560
Fool, trying to stop our battle.

644
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:48,920
Please, no!

645
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,520
The human sacrificed
himself to save the Pokémon.

646
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:02,000
l pitted them against each other.

647
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,800
Only when they set aside
their differences...

648
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:09,600
...did l see the true power
they all share deep inside.

649
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:15,760
l see now that the circumstances
of one's birth are irrelevant.

650
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,840
lt is what you do with
the gift of life...

651
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:22,040
...that determines who you are.

652
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,800
Mewtwo, where are you going?

653
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,160
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.

654
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,120
What transpired here,
l will always remember.

655
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:25,280
But perhaps for you,
these events are best forgotten.

656
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:58,760
-This could be the worst storm ever.
-You must listen to me.

657
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,120
You have got to find shelter.

658
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,320
Excuse me, please.

659
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:07,240
The Pokémon Treatment Center
will open as a shelter.

660
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:11,640
Anyone who needs a place
to stay should come with me.

661
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,960
Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny
are really great.

662
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:25,560
They keep getting more beautiful
every time l see them.

663
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,640
Guys, how did we wind up
in this place anyway?

664
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:34,200
Well, l guess we're
just here because we're here.

665
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,040
Yes, let's eat.

666
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,640
Look, it's a miracle!

667
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,800
l can't believe it.

668
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,120
-The storm disappeared.
-That's so weird!

669
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,360
lt's good to have things clear again.

670
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,320
What's that?

671
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,200
What's what?

672
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,040
-l don't see anything, Ash.
-Except the sky.

673
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,960
The day l started
my Pokémon journey...

674
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,760
...l saw a really rare Pokémon.

675
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,600
And just now, l thought
l saw another one.

676
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:46,800
Maybe you're just seeing things, Ash.

677
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,800
Maybe he's not.

678
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,720
Maybe we'll see.

679
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:02,200
Many strange legends
surround the mysteries of Pokémon.

680
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,840
Just as many adventures
await our heroes...

681
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,560
...as they continue on their quest.

682
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,880
For Ash and his friends,
the journey's just begun.

683
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:24,200
l don't know how we
got here, but who cares?

684
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:28,480
-This is paradise!
-For once, a happy ending.

685
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:33,920
Team Rocket's signing off again!

686
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,880
Have any unscreen?

687
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:41,240
I'd really like to go sailing
in one of them catamarans.
