1
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,120
My nephews, my nieces, my grandchildren...

2
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,854
I’m proud of all of them.

3
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:54,687
You make me look like the bad guy.

4
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,896
But this has been
a wonderful experience, no doubt.

5
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:03,396
There is no proof that you’re innocent.

6
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,646
What do you think?

7
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,479
That you’re wrong.

8
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,610
You are a free man.

9
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,020
You and your lawyer
asked for compensation

10
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:22,354
of 2 million euros,
which you should be receiving soon.

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,187
What will you do with this money?

12
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,900
I’d pay to make him
get a taste of his own medicine.

13
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:34,979
Mr Mauro, please,
give me a real answer.

14
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,396
What will you do with this money?

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,110
What happened?

16
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,060
He’s been throwing up all night.

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,070
-Do we have any medicine?
-No. Does he…?

18
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,562
-I’ve already asked, he doesn’t either.
-I’m going to the pharmacy.

19
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:54,979
-Can you…?
Thanks.

20
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,920
I even filmed the pharmacist.

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,604
I’m a pain in the ass, I know.

22
00:02:11,937 --> 00:02:12,600
He didn’t want me to.

23
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:15,790
By the third time he wagged
his finger I was like: "What?"

24
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,937
"Don't film me."

25
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,229
Then I turned around
and I was like...

26
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,187
Emiliano, who’s right there
and is a jackass...

27
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,940
No, I think
he went out, there’s just Luca.

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,687
I can smell his stench, here he is.

29
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:31,771
Told you. I could
smell him a mile away.

30
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,812
Didn’t he say he would come?

31
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,312
He's not coming.

32
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:38,812
What do you mean he’s not coming?

33
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,104
I’m sensing some hostility.

34
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,396
From who?

35
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:48,519
Carlo, Frank...

36
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,062
-Matano?
-Sure.

37
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,896
We’ve only lost
an hour and a half of work.

38
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:55,562
It’s not that big of a deal
when you’re making a movie in five days.

39
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,646
-Am I right?
-No.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,729
Good morning.

41
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:11,646
Were you sick?

42
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,687
I threw up.

43
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,979
-Have you taken any medication?
-Not yet.

44
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,396
What about the shots?

45
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:26,896
I’ve been in charge
of over-the-shoulder shots.

46
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,771
He took all medium shots.

47
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:43,229
We haven’t had any major issues,
just some beard noise.

48
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,850
I can’t shave it off
because my wife doesn’t want me to.

49
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,896
Rightfully so.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,820
You should have told me
before shooting, not after.

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,479
Because these scenes
are improvised and no two takes are alike.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,870
It’s fine.
Don’t tell me the other options

53
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,062
after we’ve already shot the scene
because it’s something we can’t repeat.

54
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,771
He will never do it
the same way. Understood?

55
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:13,687
Good job. Good job you too.
You didn't expect it, did you?

56
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,896
You actually got teary-eyed.

57
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,480
I was like: “It’s impossible,
my flesh and blood…”

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,400
It was completely unexpected.
"He was your grandchild".

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Amazing.

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,680
-They told me to stop.
-You can go fuck yourself.

61
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,896
You can come with
if you want to.

62
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,960
It looks nice out of focus. I like it.

63
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,812
Turn it this way, just a little bit.

64
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,104
No, sorry, the other way.

65
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:48,937
That’s it, with this part out of focus.

66
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:49,729
Like this?

67
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:53,437
You cannot see the light, it’s fine.

68
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:55,979
What should I do with the light?

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,271
-Place it there.
-Alright.

70
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:01,979
-Roll camera…
-Rolling!

71
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:04,812
Action!

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,687
Nico, can you read his lines?

73
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:20,396
Sure.

74
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,104
“Reading” is a gerund, right?

75
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,400
What is this, primary school?

76
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:28,687
Roll camera.

77
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,979
Rolling.

78
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,771
Action!

79
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,479
A girl reported being approached
by a man in much the same way.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,771
When her parents read
on the newspaper that a kid went missing

81
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:49,771
they immediately called us
to see if they could help us identify this man.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,187
Take a look.

83
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,420
-Here?
-Yes.

84
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,110
Maybe you can move a bit...

85
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,937
-I think we should move into the shade.
-I have my doubts.

86
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:16,562
Let’s move into the shade.

87
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,396
Vittorio, you look different.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,040
Where is Massimo?

89
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:30,479
There he is, let’s go.

90
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,646
We are looking for a man

91
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,396
in his thirties...

92
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:43,700
Say “in his forties”.

93
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,062
A man in his forties

94
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:48,646
who seems to enjoy scaring kids.

95
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,104
I'm moving it, ok?

96
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,271
-Is everyone ready?
-Let’s do this.

97
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:03,687
Daniele asked to do a sound check.

98
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:07,070
-Sure, do the sound check.
-Can you say your lines?

99
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,104
Good morning sir,

100
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:11,780
I’m Detective Ruggeri.

101
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,370
I’ve just met your daughter,

102
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,604
who was so kind
as to give me your phone number.

103
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:19,500
Try not to look down when you speak.

104
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,139
-Roll camera.
-Rolling!

105
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,479
Action!

106
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,770
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

107
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,521
I was home with the flu.

108
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:42,271
Gianni, from the town nearby,
came over to help.

109
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,771
He helped me in the fields.

110
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,271
I was so weak I couldn’t even get up.

111
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:55,687
Cut!

112
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:04,187
-Oh no, not you again!
-The pain in the ass is back.

113
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:11,979
We have a big nursery with many plants.

114
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,229
We are quite the experts.

115
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,396
These plants are gorgeous
but they need some care.

116
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,021
Action!

117
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,812
Cut! Let’s review this shot,
but it should be ok.

118
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:55,479
The lighter!
But you don’t go to jail for a lighter.

119
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:00,396
Wait, Nicolò. Here, take it
before I lose it.

120
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:03,396
I'm trusting you with this, don’t lose it.

121
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,396
I’m gonna lose it in no time.

122
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:11,854
This might take a while…
Let’s just watch it on there.

123
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:14,146
Do you see any shadows?

124
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,979
I don’t think so.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,687
-Yes, maybe a little bit.
-I can see some shadows, but...

126
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,312
Keep going.

127
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:47,104
Keep going. Okay.

128
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,979
Action!

129
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,646
We’ll do another take.
Today we’re making you break a sweat, sorry.

130
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,854
Yes, go down the stairs.
What, did you want to change it up?

131
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:13,340
-Roll camera.
-Rolling...

132
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,812
Action!

133
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:37,729
-Roll camera, roll sound.
-Rolling.

134
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:40,521
-Mark it.
-Scene 10, roll 1, take 2.

135
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,979
-Roll camera.
-Rolling.

136
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,604
Scene 10, close-ups, roll 1, take 1.

137
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,604
Action!

138
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,854
Good morning,
what brings you here?

139
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:59,229
An ugly story I’m afraid,
a story of demons.

140
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,937
It seems like we have
a big bad wolf in the woods.

141
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,854
Roll camera, rolling, mark it.

142
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:18,896
Scene 24, close-ups, roll 1, take 3.

143
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,229
Action!

144
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:27,979
Rolling!

145
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,104
-Mark it.
- Scene ABC, roll 1, take 1.

146
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,562
Action!

147
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:43,187
Incoming!

148
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,729
And it hits you.

149
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:51,437
Tonight you’ll be coming to dinner
with a big bump on your head.

150
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,396
Roll camera.

151
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,437
-Rolling.
-Mark it.

152
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:03,870
-You’re always in the way.
-Can you read it?

153
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,562
ABC, roll 1, take 2.

154
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,521
Action!

155
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,250
Cut!

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,771
I said: “Sorry, we’re doing
a sound check, wait a second…”

157
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,937
She was like “ok”
then started making a lot of noise.

158
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,146
She said: "I just wanted
to annoy Daniele".

159
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,187
Roll camera!

160
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,562
-It wouldn’t go up.
-Cut!

161
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,937
-Now it works.
-It’s doing it on purpose,

162
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:38,687
just to spite you.
Let’s do another take.

163
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,146
-Are we ready to go?
-Okay. Roll camera.

164
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,399
Go Carlo, go.
Go with the left tyre.

165
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,062
Go, go!

166
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,771
You are young,
you have the equipment.

167
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,660
Just write a 5-minute scene and
shoot it in secret, without telling us.

168
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:32,604
We have no director,
no screenwriter, no nothing.

169
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,979
You don’t need much
when you have a theatre like this one.

170
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:41,104
You don’t even need actors.

171
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:45,521
Picture this: everything is dark,
with just a few lights

172
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:49,650
and the right music.
Two or three actors get up and down to the beat.

173
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:54,021
Completely at random.
And you have your horror movie.

174
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,146
A three-to-five-minute short film.

175
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,479
A Little Red Riding Hood horror story.

176
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,146
Lighter scene, roll 1, take 1.

177
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,812
Action!

178
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,854
Cut!
Action!

179
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,604
Action!

180
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,229
Cut!

181
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,521
-Stay in that position.
-Alright.

182
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,437
-Rolling!
-Mark it.

183
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,354
Scene 133, VPA, roll 1, take 1.

184
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:43,604
Action!

185
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:47,687
Roll camera.

186
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,021
Rolling.

187
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,979
Sound rolling.

188
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,771
Scene Bah, roll 1, take 1.

189
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,729
Action!

190
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:17,604
Now we have a close-up
of you telling the fairytale.

191
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,062
-Are you happy with the shot?
-I am.

192
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:27,104
Now that you know where she lives
you can stay home. It’s fine.

193
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:30,409
Let’s do a close-up on him.

194
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:31,937
From the side?

195
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:32,979
No, from the front.

196
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,104
-The light is on him now, right?
-Exactly.

197
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,521
In this way.

198
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,104
Scene 7, CA, roll 1, take 1.

199
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,979
Action!

200
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,937
-Gargioni.
-Gargione.

201
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:08,062
Unfortunately we didn’t have a marker,
so it’s a little bit difficult to read.

202
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,687
Where should I put the lighter?
On the stairs...?

203
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:18,104
Yes, halfway.

204
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,146
Lights off on stage.
I like it.

205
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,771
Lights off on stage.

206
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:30,604
Lights off on stage!

207
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:35,271
All of a sudden you turn the lights on

208
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:38,229
and "The Show Must Go On"
starts playing. Just perfect.

209
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:43,312
Roll camera!

210
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,312
Slowly.

211
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,187
-Mark it.
-Scene 14, roll 1, take 1.

212
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,146
Action!

213
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,229
Are you ready, Luca?

214
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,896
Ok.

215
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,771
Remember to look at him.
Don’t look at me. Look at him.

216
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,521
-Roll camera...
-Rolling.

217
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:49,210
-Sound rolling.
-Scene 14, close-ups, roll 1, take 3.

218
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:53,396
Action!

219
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:05,021
Listen, Franco. She’ll be sitting here
and you’ll be coming from there.

220
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,187
And then he says:
"Do you want me to go with you?"

221
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,854
To which you answer: "No, I live close by."

222
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,729
Scene 16, roll 1, take 2.

223
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,271
Action!

224
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,479
Cut!

225
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,812
Mr Vella, please don’t pay
any mind to these peasants.

226
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,104
Say your lines with the Swedish man.

227
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,479
-So you stop monologuing and say…
-”I’ll make something to eat!”

228
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,396
Good!

229
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,646
“I’ll make you something to eat.”

230
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,521
-Alright.
-Who wants a coffee?

231
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,650
Coffee sounds great.

232
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,604
-Rolling.
-Sound rolling.

233
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,396
Scene DE, roll 1, take 1.

234
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,146
Action!

235
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:41,354
She’s still here,
looking down on us from Heaven.

236
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:42,979
She’s never really left us.

237
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:46,604
Good job. Both of you.

238
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:52,062
This shot must be out of focus.

239
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:56,479
We’ll see a pair of legs
approaching her, but they won’t be in focus.

240
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,812
You go straight to the door.

241
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,771
You knock.

242
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:08,021
Great.
Then you knock again.

243
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:26,550
-What can we ask?
-What can we say?

244
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,312
-I’m Lisa.
-She is a third my age.

245
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,646
You can ask her
to call you by your first name.

246
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,479
But I already do that.

247
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:37,812
Of course.

248
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,896
You can say you
are the main character.

249
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:43,771
Because you are!

250
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,562
She doesn’t care.
It's not a big deal.

251
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,687
She’s just the most important character.

252
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,979
My classmates won’t believe me.

253
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:55,771
But then they’ll see the movie.

254
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,562
Don’t you have
some pictures you can show them?

255
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,562
No, it’s still a secret.

256
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,437
I’m telling them anyway.

257
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:06,771
We’ll invite your
classmates to the premiere, ok?

258
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:09,437
And you’ll be like:
“See? I told you so."

259
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,812
Be careful.

260
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,354
-Did we take the clapperboard?
-Yes.

261
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:37,937
-This doesn’t really look like Sicily.
-We’re in the hinterland.

262
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,062
In France.

263
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,812
Look, there’s a well!

264
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,646
Nice, there is a well over there.

265
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:49,854
It’s incredible what you can see
simply by driving around.

266
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,104
This camera is almost like my baby.

267
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,396
I even dreamt of it last night.

268
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,937
Do you also sleep with it, or…?

269
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,312
It’s on the night table, it keeps me company.

270
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,854
Action!

271
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:11,187
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

272
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,896
-Carola, we can go.
-Okay, Dad.

273
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:24,604
Cut!

274
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:27,771
Roll camera!

275
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,104
-Rolling.
-FM, roll 1, take 1.

276
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,812
Action!

277
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,354
I knew you shouldn’t have come.

278
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,937
Now we shoot the scene.
Keep your eyes closed, pretend to be asleep.

279
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,354
-Roll camera!
-Rolling.

280
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,396
Sound rolling.

281
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,729
Scene SAD, roll 1, take 1. Action!

282
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,000
Mr Mauro, you were accused,

283
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,729
convicted and imprisoned,

284
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:39,521
for a heinous crime - pedophilia.

285
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,771
Five years later,
you were cleared of all charges

286
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:46,812
and now you’re free.

287
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:49,021
What do you think?

288
00:26:51,187 --> 00:26:54,479
I think that five years are a long time.

289
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,354
I hope they catch the real culprit

290
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:59,479
who is still on the loose.

291
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:03,570
I’m one of eight siblings.

292
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:07,812
We had a good family -
wives, children, sisters-in-law...

293
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,187
Then I was thrown in jail for five years.

294
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,521
The first ten days were awful.

295
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,620
What I went through -
I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.

296
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,437
I went through a lot.

297
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,854
I couldn’t sleep at night.

298
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:29,396
I couldn’t eat.
I had nightmares.

299
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:32,687
I had done nothing wrong.

300
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:36,854
Sure, I got home but...

301
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,979
Everything had changed.

302
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,062
My wife, my children...
They seem different now.

303
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:48,780
I’ll tell you what happened.

304
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:55,562
That day I was
in those woods with my dog.

305
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:56,979
We used to go there every night.

306
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,521
My dog would hunt hedgehogs

307
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:06,521
and bring them to me alive.

308
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:12,896
So, I saw him come out
of this door that was usually locked,

309
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,521
and stop right at the entrance.

310
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:18,354
It was odd.
My dog is very smart, you see.

311
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:21,687
He wouldn’t come to me,
he stopped right there.

312
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:26,229
That got my attention,
so I decided to go inside.

313
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:30,729
And there it was.
What they accused me of.

314
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,021
It was your grandchild.

315
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,604
No, that’s impossible.

316
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,800
My grandchild would
always play with my dog.

317
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,812
They got along well, it’s impossible.

318
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:50,229
It was your grandchild.
That child was your grandchild.

319
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,479
Maybe he was too trusting,
he felt safe there?

320
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,312
Look...I...

321
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:07,354
I would have never,
he’s my flesh and blood.

322
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,521
But I will do anything
I can to find who did it.

323
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:20,104
I’d give anything to
find him and make him pay.

324
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:22,062
I want him to suffer.

325
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:25,312
I’ll take the law into my own hands.

326
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,771
Prisons have their own laws.

327
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:32,354
Women and children are off limits.

328
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:35,312
Outside, there are many other laws

329
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,812
that cause innocent men to be put in prison.

330
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,062
Finding this person would be easier,
if only you were given the compensation you deserve.

331
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:48,021
But we heard that this won’t happen.

332
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,420
Yes, whatever,
I have lost a grandchild.

333
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,896
I don’t care about the money.

334
00:29:55,729 --> 00:30:00,562
I would use the money
to find this person,

335
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:05,896
and make him go through
whatever he made my grandchild go through.

336
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,396
I would pay ten people to do to him
what was done to me in prison.

337
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,812
The same thing,
but with ten people.

338
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,687
Hello?

339
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:39,104
Who?

340
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:44,687
Fuck, what a pain in the ass.

341
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:50,604
It’s a waste of time!

342
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,979
Send someone else.

343
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,604
Alright.

344
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,146
Fucking hell.

345
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,312
Here I am, go ahead.

346
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,396
Detective Ruggeri...

347
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,021
Don’t you feel any shame?

348
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:58,771
You sent an innocent man
to jail, for five years.

349
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:02,937
On a pedophilia charge.

350
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,960
That man was abused.
Now he’s out but he has no family, no life.

351
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:09,437
All because of your incompetence.

352
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,896
I was just doing my job,
put yourself in my shoes.

353
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,320
In your shoes?

354
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,620
I couldn’t even if I tried.

355
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,354
Accusing a man of such things,

356
00:32:23,354 --> 00:32:26,396
taking the matter to Court,
having everyone believe you

357
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:28,990
for some inexplicable reason...

358
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,521
I’ve been doing this job for 30 years.

359
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:34,312
I solved over 500 cases.

360
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:39,062
You may have an excellent
track record, but maybe it’s time to quit.

361
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,312
Thirty years is a long time,
Maybe you’re just too old.

362
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,090
I don’t think so, I’m a long way from retirement.

363
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:51,604
Don’t you have an ounce of regret?
Don’t you feel responsible?

364
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,479
I’ve always done what I believed was right.

365
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,562
I’ve always been competent at my job.

366
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,187
If you think something isn’t right,

367
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:06,604
report it to the authorities.

368
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,396
Then request a formal investigation.

369
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,312
I don’t feel any guilt.

370
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:12,271
Who should he turn to though?

371
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:15,687
The authorities jailed him and tore his life apart.

372
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,062
Because of you.

373
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,437
Who should he turn to?

374
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:21,604
He had done nothing wrong.

375
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:24,562
Now he has lost everything,
He has no house, no family left.

376
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:27,812
Listen...

377
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:34,771
In life, there are winners
and there are losers.

378
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:37,479
Maybe that was his destiny.

379
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,187
I cannot be held responsible for that.

380
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:47,950
Not even for what happened to that man?

381
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,354
Don't you think you're morally responsible?

382
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,271
You made a mistake
that changed his life forever.

383
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:57,687
Do you know what?

384
00:33:58,354 --> 00:33:59,479
He should take a vacation.

385
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:05,104
Maybe ask for compensation.

386
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:07,854
See?

387
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:13,479
-Is that all you have to say?
-If he’s as innocent as he says...

388
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:29,104
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

389
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:35,521
-Let’s go, Carola.
-Okay, Dad.

390
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,580
I’m so happy you’re here.

391
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:50,854
Good girl.

392
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,021
You’re growing up so fast,
you’re going to be as beautiful as your mother.

393
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,479
I remember her.

394
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:06,687
I remember that she
would sit on the swing

395
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:08,979
and play just like
you do, in the same park.

396
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,900
She would spend
the whole day there, always happy and smiling.

397
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:18,900
We miss Mum.

398
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:20,937
We miss her.

399
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,021
But she’s never really left us.

400
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:28,896
She’s still here,
looking down on us from Heaven.

401
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:34,830
Do you go to school?
Good girl.

402
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,354
Wait, I’ll make something to eat.

403
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:41,104
Just a second.

404
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,604
This is bad, Mario.

405
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,830
We must look everywhere.

406
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:15,130
We must find him no matter what.

407
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:18,771
Everyone knows everyone around here.

408
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,396
If he lives here,
this cannot be his first time doing this.

409
00:40:58,604 --> 00:41:01,646
Find out if there are
similar cases to this in the surrounding area.

410
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,771
Send me an email.

411
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:07,062
While we wait,
we must call the Social Services.

412
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,410
It’s a delicate matter.

413
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:13,979
If anything changes,
please let me know.

414
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,562
We can’t arrest all those
going for a walk in the woods.

415
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:36,312
We need more clues.

416
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,050
Who gave you this information?

417
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,396
Call the Forest Service, too.

418
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,521
Please find out if anything similar

419
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,620
has ever happened in this area.

420
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,562
Twenty years ago, for example.

421
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,437
I’ll go take a look in the woods.

422
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,271
Let’s start from there.

423
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:29,187
Where are you hiding,

424
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,271
you monster?

425
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,104
Dad, I went to the theatre
the other day. Can I go again?

426
00:44:37,104 --> 00:44:40,271
Fine, but please be careful.

427
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:41,000
Okay, bye.

428
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,229
Have you noticed?

429
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:08,437
No, you haven’t noticed
the way they nod at me.

430
00:45:10,562 --> 00:45:12,354
It’s almost like they’re afraid.

431
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,354
That’s because I’m a lawyer.

432
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,812
A lawyer!

433
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,812
It means the law.

434
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:29,062
And the word “law” has never
sounded good or friendly in this neighbourhood.

435
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,021
That has been true
since the days of ancient Greece and Carthage.

436
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,396
I only came here when I was twenty-five.

437
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:43,437
In those days, Al Capone,
the greatest Carthaginian of all

438
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:47,062
was learning his
trade on these pavements.

439
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:52,562
Frankie Yale himself was cut
precisely in half by a machine gun!

440
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:57,104
On the corner of Union Street.

441
00:45:57,609 --> 00:45:59,229
Two blocks away!

442
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,479
Fuck!

443
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,646
Now listen carefully.

444
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,104
You too!

445
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:17,437
This is not Sicily.

446
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,354
It’s Red Hook.

447
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:22,021
This is the gullet of Brooklyn

448
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:25,479
swallowing the tonnage of the world.

449
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,646
My friends, especially my wife,

450
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:40,771
tell me the people
in this neighbourhood lack elegance,

451
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:42,859
they lack glamour.

452
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:46,854
After all, who have I
dealt with in my life?

453
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,950
Longshoremen and
the wives, fathers, children

454
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,979
of longshoremen!

455
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,590
However, believe me when I say that

456
00:46:58,354 --> 00:47:01,604
every few years there is still a case.

457
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:05,979
And as the parties
tell me what the trouble is…

458
00:47:07,604 --> 00:47:09,229
Do you know what happens?

459
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,104
The flat air in my office
suddenly washes in

460
00:47:14,104 --> 00:47:16,729
with the green scent of the sea

461
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:18,979
and the dust in this air is blown away.

462
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,396
And the thought comes

463
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,146
that in some Caesar’s year

464
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,187
in Calabria perhaps
or on the cliff at Syracuse,

465
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:38,812
another lawyer, quite differently dressed

466
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,771
heard the same complaint

467
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,896
and sat there
as powerless as I

468
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:51,854
and watched it run its bloody course.

469
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:56,896
Now,

470
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,562
try to remember

471
00:48:03,437 --> 00:48:06,396
at least 20% of what I’ve just said.

472
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,562
20% at the very least.

473
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:12,396
I’ll be back in one hour.

474
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,521
Let’s see what you make of it.

475
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,062
Get to work.

476
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:33,104
- Hello cutie pie.
- Hi.

477
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,896
- May I sit here?
-Yes.

478
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,979
What are you doing here all alone?

479
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:44,646
I’m waiting for my dad.

480
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,271
Your dad?

481
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:49,979
And where is he?

482
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:51,812
He’s at the doctor’s.

483
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,812
Did you like the show?

484
00:48:58,021 --> 00:48:58,562
Yes.

485
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,229
Do you know I also do children’s shows?

486
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,229
With kids your age.

487
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,562
-How old are you?
-Eight.

488
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:13,437
Eight! You’re all grown up!

489
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:16,771
- And what’s your name?
-Carola.

490
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,021
That’s a beautiful name!

491
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,271
- Does he have a name?
-No.

492
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,021
What about we give him one?

493
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,646
Yes or no?

494
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,521
Nevermind then.

495
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,021
He’s nice, though. Very nice.

496
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:36,687
Such beautiful hands.

497
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:41,854
You’re very pretty.

498
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,229
Would you like to be in one of my shows?

499
00:49:50,312 --> 00:49:52,354
-Is Dad fine with it?
-Yes.

500
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,687
We can meet every
other day, what do you think?

501
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,550
Kids usually work with me

502
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,771
for five hours, give or take.
That’s not a problem, is it?

503
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,646
Good.

504
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:06,562
Carola!

505
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,562
It’s time to go.

506
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,562
How are you?
I’m fine, everything’s fine.

507
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:44,021
Not yet, but she’ll be here any moment now.

508
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:52,896
You know how girls are.

509
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,812
They stop to chat, taking
their sweet time as we wait and wait.

510
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:59,271
I’m sure she’ll arrive soon.

511
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,271
Do you always come here to play?

512
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:19,396
Yes, because grandpa used to work here.

513
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,896
-What does he do?
- He chops wood.

514
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,229
Do you see this place here?

515
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:27,729
It’s very dangerous.

516
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:29,062
You must be careful.

517
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,729
I come here all the time,
so I know my way around.

518
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,062
A child fell in there once.

519
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,021
It was an accident.

520
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:40,854
Do you know what my job is?

521
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,271
I’m a woodsman.

522
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,312
I find wounded animals
and get them the care they need.

523
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,854
Then I patrol the woods

524
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,021
and whenever I see poachers
I catch them and arrest them.

525
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,104
Of course, I also do many other things.

526
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,604
Now I must go to work.

527
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:06,319
Are we clear? Never go out when it’s dark.

528
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,687
The woods are very
dangerous, do you understand?

529
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,729
If anyone tries to catch
a bunny, I’ll arrest them! Okay?

530
00:53:18,812 --> 00:53:23,354
Have you seen a man
walking around in sports clothes,

531
00:53:23,354 --> 00:53:26,562
someone you had
never seen around here before?

532
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:30,146
Maybe someone in town saw him?

533
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,729
The closer he was to the cabin

534
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:38,609
the louder the snoring got.

535
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:43,521
So the huntsman decided to get in.

536
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:44,729
And what did he find inside?

537
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:47,646
The wolf - snoring.

538
00:53:47,646 --> 00:53:51,646
He thought: “I should kill the wolf now,
there won’t be a better time.

539
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,396
If he ate Little Red
Riding Hood and her grandma

540
00:53:56,396 --> 00:53:59,812
I have to cut him open.”

541
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:03,854
So he did. He cut open the wolf’s belly

542
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:07,021
and saw a red hood.

543
00:54:07,562 --> 00:54:12,329
Little Red Riding Hood lifted her head,
climbed up and jumped out of the belly.

544
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,396
Grandma jumped out right after her.

545
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:18,604
They were both safe and sound!

546
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:24,896
They thanked the
huntsman and went home.

547
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:29,062
So the huntsman filled
the wolf’s belly with some stones

548
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,854
then sewed it back together.

549
00:54:31,979 --> 00:54:35,146
When the wolf woke up he tried to walk

550
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,437
but his belly was too heavy!

551
00:54:38,437 --> 00:54:40,312
He collapsed and fell dead.

552
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:44,437
It’s a bit sad, but at least
Little Red Riding Hood was safe.

553
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,312
The wolf deserved it.

554
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,562
It’s a good story, isn’t it?

555
00:54:51,562 --> 00:54:54,229
We could tell this story on stage.

556
00:54:54,229 --> 00:54:55,854
Would you like
to be Little Red Riding Hood?

557
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:56,354
Yes.

558
00:54:56,604 --> 00:54:58,146
Sounds good, right?

559
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:02,604
Would you tell me where you live?

560
00:55:03,479 --> 00:55:04,979
I live in a house in the woods.

561
00:55:07,146 --> 00:55:08,646
Can I come over sometime?

562
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,812
Your dad comes here every other day.

563
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,270
If I don’t see you, I’ll come to your house.

564
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,937
-Can I?
-Yes.

565
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:23,646
But you must promise me something.

566
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,771
Don’t tell your dad that I’m coming.

567
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:30,021
Ok.

568
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:31,354
Don’t tell your mum either.

569
00:55:32,521 --> 00:55:33,812
-Deal?
-Deal.

570
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:36,396
-It will be our secret.
-Ok.

571
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,271
-Can I trust you?
-Yes.

572
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:47,479
There are no official reports yet,
just rumours about a man in his thirties

573
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:51,396
who seems to enjoy scaring kids.

574
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,187
-Hi.
-Hi.

575
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,437
-You really like coming here to play, don’t you?
-Yeah.

576
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:18,687
-In the woods?
-Yeah.

577
00:56:20,729 --> 00:56:23,104
I’m afraid I have bad news for you.

578
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:24,979
It’s time to go home.

579
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:28,062
There’s a big bad wolf in the woods.

580
00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:32,050
Come on, I’ll take you home.

581
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,896
But I live close by.

582
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,062
I’ll come with you either way,
because that wolf is very naughty.

583
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,646
Come on, let’s go home.

584
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,437
It looks like our bad guy is gone.

585
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,604
But I want to make sure
for the kids’ sake.

586
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:58,562
We’re going to catch him soon.

587
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:34,354
-Hey there, cutie pie!
-Hi!

588
00:57:37,896 --> 00:57:39,604
-How are you?
-I’m fine.

589
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:44,062
I’m very happy to see you.

590
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,396
-Has your dad gone out?
-Yes.

591
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:52,604
-Is that your house?
-Yes.

592
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:57,104
Has your mum gone out too?

593
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,187
Geppetto!

594
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:09,062
-Geppetto could have a small part
in our play, what do you think?

595
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,437
We’ll do Little Red Riding Hood.

596
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:21,771
Close your eyes, I have a surprise for you.

597
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,354
You can open them.

598
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:33,562
-Do you like it?
-Yes!

599
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,687
-Very much or just a little?
-Very much.

600
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:39,000
Very very much?

601
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,437
May I?

602
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,396
Remember to wear it under your jacket.

603
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,396
I want to show you
where we’ll play Little Red Riding Hood.

604
00:59:11,562 --> 00:59:13,812
But promise me one thing.

605
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,271
Promise me you won’t tell mum and dad.

606
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:20,730
Okay.

607
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:23,354
Do you promise?

608
00:59:23,354 --> 00:59:25,937
-Can I trust you?
-Yes.

609
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,229
Come on, let’s go.

610
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:07,021
No, I haven’t seen anyone.

611
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:09,450
I was home with the flu.

612
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:12,062
Gianni, from the town nearby,
came over to help.

613
01:01:12,062 --> 01:01:15,146
I was so weak I couldn’t even get up.

614
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:16,521
I didn’t see anyone.

615
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:17,937
What happened?

616
01:01:19,729 --> 01:01:22,271
How am I supposed not to worry?

617
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:24,729
My grandchild is wandering
the woods as we speak.

618
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:27,854
Tell me what’s happening, Mr Ruggeri.

619
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:30,187
What happened? Tell me what happened!

620
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,687
Wait, someone is knocking at the door!

621
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,187
It must be her, thank you for calling.

622
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,910
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

623
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,729
What brings you here?

624
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,070
An ugly story, I’m afraid.

625
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,312
A story of demons.

626
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,229
It seems like there’s
a big bad wolf in the woods.

627
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:07,021
What are you talking about?

628
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,890
My partner should have
already informed the Forest Service.

629
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,021
You didn’t know?

630
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,604
No.

631
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:18,687
We’re looking for
a man in his early forties,

632
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:21,604
who has allegedly
been approaching children in this area.

633
01:03:23,854 --> 01:03:26,312
Where were you last week?

634
01:03:26,312 --> 01:03:27,979
I’ve always been here, sir.

635
01:03:27,979 --> 01:03:33,812
Every morning I go to town early,
then I come back here.

636
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,896
I usually go home at around 7 pm.

637
01:03:38,479 --> 01:03:39,854
Please show me your documents.

638
01:03:50,146 --> 01:03:50,896
Here.

639
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:58,604
How long have you been
working as a woodsman?

640
01:03:59,354 --> 01:04:01,396
Sixteen years.

641
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,437
Ever since I did my civil service.

642
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,354
Is there any problem?

643
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,396
Is there anyone who could testify

644
01:04:08,396 --> 01:04:11,771
as to your working hours
here in these woods?

645
01:04:11,771 --> 01:04:14,690
My coworker Andrea,
but he works the night shift.

646
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:16,646
Therefore no, there is no one.

647
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,687
You can only take my word for it.

648
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,021
Are you married? Do you have children?

649
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:27,720
No sir, I don’t even
have nephews or nieces.

650
01:04:28,604 --> 01:04:30,521
Why do you ask?

651
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,937
-Do you live here?
-I live at my house.

652
01:04:37,479 --> 01:04:38,562
I beg your pardon.

653
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:44,854
Hello?

654
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,812
We cannot arrest every single person
who goes mushroom hunting in the woods.

655
01:04:54,312 --> 01:04:55,771
We need more clues.

656
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,187
Who gave you this information?

657
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:09,312
I’m coming.

658
01:05:12,479 --> 01:05:14,146
We’re not done here.

659
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,479
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

660
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,146
If you ever see a man
around 40 hiking alone in the woods

661
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:26,040
call me immediately.

662
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,646
Thank you.

663
01:05:31,146 --> 01:05:32,021
I’m sorry,

664
01:05:34,437 --> 01:05:35,687
I need one.

665
01:05:38,604 --> 01:05:39,604
Want one?

666
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,646
No, thank you,
I don’t take candy from strangers.

667
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,646
See you.

668
01:05:46,646 --> 01:05:48,146
Goodbye.

669
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,604
Hello?

670
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:44,354
Do you like it here?

671
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,937
I do.

672
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,521
I’m starting an acting school.

673
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:03,437
Why do you ask?

674
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,021
An acting school?

675
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:19,187
Yes, an acting school.

676
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,229
Be careful.

677
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:33,604
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,

678
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:39,896
With witchcraft of his wits,
with traitorous gifts -

679
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:48,396
O wicked wit and gifts,
that have the power so to seduce!

680
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:54,646
—won to his shameful lust
the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

681
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:58,729
That it went hand in hand even with the vow!

682
01:13:04,604 --> 01:13:06,062
No, it doesn’t work.

683
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,187
It doesn’t work.

684
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:17,104
It cannot possibly work.

685
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:21,920
No.

686
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,979
It won’t fucking work.

687
01:13:24,937 --> 01:13:26,021
It has to work.

688
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,354
This is my kingdom.

689
01:13:54,812 --> 01:13:56,396
What are you doing here?

690
01:14:02,812 --> 01:14:05,562
I’m rehearsing for my upcoming show.

691
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,771
What are you doing here?

692
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:24,979
I knew it.
I knew you shouldn’t have come here.

693
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:35,646
You think you know what’s best for me.

694
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,562
You’ve always been like this.

695
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:47,396
You saw the girl.

696
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,271
You fucking saw her!

697
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,687
You saw her.

698
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,021
Don’t worry about it.

699
01:15:05,396 --> 01:15:06,479
She’s mine.

700
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,271
I will fix everything.

701
01:15:08,521 --> 01:15:10,479
She’s mine!

702
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,646
Come with me.

703
01:15:13,646 --> 01:15:15,521
She’s mine.

704
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,729
Let’s go home.

705
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,229
Come on.

706
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:12,396
Mr Ruggeri, this is where you
stopped that monster once and for all.

707
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:14,646
How did you solve the case?

708
01:17:15,271 --> 01:17:17,687
We had been looking for him
for a very long time.

709
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,437
I followed him to this abandoned warehouse

710
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:22,979
but he had a knife.

711
01:17:23,849 --> 01:17:25,354
I had to defend myself.

712
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:28,937
Now the monster’s finally gone.

713
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:32,229
We would like to thank you
for everything you’ve done.

714
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:34,187
You truly saved us all.

715
01:17:35,937 --> 01:17:38,312
Thank you, Mr Ruggeri.
And thank you for agreeing to this interview.

716
01:17:38,969 --> 01:17:40,646
It was an honour to meet you, you’re a hero.

717
01:17:40,646 --> 01:17:41,812
The honour was mine.

718
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,771
Turn the camera on!

719
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:56,979
You’re the monster!
You son of a bitch!

720
01:17:57,349 --> 01:17:58,771
You’re the devil himself.

721
01:17:58,771 --> 01:18:01,479
The girl has come out
of coma, I have proof!

722
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:02,312
Stay right where you are!

723
01:18:02,896 --> 01:18:04,104
Or I'll kill you!
