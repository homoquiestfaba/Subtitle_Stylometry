1
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:46,720
Coast Guard, 2nd Commander

2
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:48,978
How I can take your call?

3
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:56,183
- Mr.
- Do not have a new
baby to be home?

4
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:01,818
I'll stay as you have
a 456 line 4

5
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:08,317
- Captain Maine.
- What?

6
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,171
How big?

7
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,261
I'm coming

8
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:21,065
- Problems sir? - Bring me to Snives
- Mr immediately

9
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,119
- "He called me sir?
- No, Snives

10
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:40,366
- But since no one else.
- Sorry sir, good morning

11
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:43,549
I think this morning there
is nothing good

12
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:38,897
Watch where you walk

13
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:45,559
I'd rather see someone die rather than
give mouth to mouth resuscitation

14
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:51,800
- Still not sure
- I am sure is coming

15
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,068
You're a hopeless case

16
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,850
Your boyfriend is here

17
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:46,680
- It's so great.
- The planes are great girl

18
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,615
This is monumental

19
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,817
Are we?

20
00:06:56,363 --> 00:07:00,322
I changed my mind, your
dad has to come now

21
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,828
Really, why?

22
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:06,158
Well, I think you have
to know someone

23
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:12,585
What?
I thought you had
it in your hands

24
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,228
Besides does not like your dad?

25
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:20,062
No, I would hate if I
met him, believe me

26
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,555
Good is the boat owner

27
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:27,858
Well to address

28
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,443
How are you?
How are you, having a good time?

29
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:42,588
Enjoy, How are you? Hello, hello

30
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,908
- Look at this, hi.

autograph please?

00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,375

00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,126
- I like that name.
- Now make safer than old

35
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,472
Only bad children for safety
are not permitted

36
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:28,317
- Hi, Dad. - Amy
- Let me guess, work

37
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:33,493
There is a glacier that
want to investigate

38
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,981
Dad the boat is amazing there
is nothing to worry about

39
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:42,571
Not that I worry about
the outside

40
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,914
We talked about this, how
much is in that boat?

41
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:48,683
We agreed that it
was good for me

42
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,825
Yes, but that was before
I realized ...

43
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:55,023
the rush to put him on
the anniversary was

44
00:08:56,883 --> 00:09:00,444
- Dad, the boat passed inspection?
- With the just

45
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,503

00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:11,778
Yes, everything looks nice

53
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,124
- How is your dad?
- OK

54
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,988
- See ya.
- Bye

55
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:37,204
Ladies and gentlemen I thank
you all for coming

56
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:40,514
On this day come with me to
the history of this country

57
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:46,368
And that he sees a good future
and establish a new path

58
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:52,709
A day in which the loss of the lives
of the predecessor of this boat

59
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,288
Will be replaced with the memory of the
larger boat, fast, and sophisticated

60
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,524
ever built, the Titanic II

61
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,187
I want to introduce the man
who will guide this ship

62
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,134
Will ship's Captain Howard

63
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:24,505
I hope you all enjoy as we all

64
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,673
And we enter the history book

65
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:54,580
- Will not you come to lunch?
- I had lunch 5 minutes ago

66
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:59,505
- How dull.
- Do not let them bite you

67
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,858
- All passengers are on board sir.
- Well

68
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,736
- Let's make history.
- Yes sir

69
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:01,333
Control tower this is the
6565 Coast Guard change

70
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:06,629
How will 6565 Copy Captain?

71
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,975
We will land in a couple
of minutes, during

72
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:14,631
- The Coast Guard will be on hold.
- Do you have another bad
presentimiendo Captain?

73
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,942
You could say

74
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:27,202
- There is the camp.
- Yes sir I see

75
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,760
- The Coast Guard is here.
- Really?

76
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:06,531
They should give a smaller

77
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:10,994
- It is very far
- I'll leave it on just in case

78
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:15,201
- Dr Kim Patterson.
- Nice

79
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:30,447
Insurance will wonder why you asked to
come but his reputation precedes him

80
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,861
And I need someone serious when I
say that we are on a time bomb

81
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:36,594
I'm listening

82
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:43,785
The wave of collapse yesterday
went to northern Canada

83
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:49,365
The piece of ice that fell from collapse,
is the size of Manhattan

84
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,017
I figured it would make a
piece of ice that size

85
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,531
I guess we push to mid-Atlantic

86
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,826
Across the Atlantic

87
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,883
These measures are mass balance

88
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,141
That when the temperature increases
the balance shifts

89
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,047
The ice show

90
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:09,530
These tests tell us that the
ice in which we are now

91
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:13,174
Thickness has decreased
60 meters in a year

92
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,865
- It's awesome.
- Exactly

93
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,469
I think there is anything you
would like to see follow me

94
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,006
Of course there is global
warming true

95
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:42,931
- Can you tell me what the hell am I watching?
- The collapse of yesterday

96
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:51,942
God

97
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:58,431
Have you ever thought of
Captain Armageddon?

98
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:03,285
If yesterday's collapse was only a trifle
the following will be colossal

99
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:06,699
Now imagine the Atlantic Ocean

100
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,380
Do you admire your masterpiece?

101
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:44,511
Yes, I did Do not be
late for your party?

102
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:53,839
It's my boat, I think I will wait also
would like to enter with a girl

103
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:04,425
- You know, I called you.
- Yes

104
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:06,318
If only be delayed six months

105
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:12,667
Your dad gave me a punch
in the nose you expect

106
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,724
I found driving his boat at
2 am without his consent

107
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:22,026
- I think he was right.
- You're still the Daddy's girl

108
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,041
Look Who's Talking

109
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:36,365
I did not speak, I feel what happened to
your dad, I know how much he wanted

110
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,521
Do not mention it

111
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,460
Looks like you left in charge

112
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,927
COA industries

113
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,780
I always thought you'd
end as coastguard

114
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:59,868
Yeah, well ...
when you give the keys of an
empire is hard to refuse

115
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,261
You still have the earrings
that I gave you

116
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,406
Yes, I have so many earrings

117
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,941
Well, those like me

118
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:21,642
You could have answered the call

119
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:29,530
And then what ...
pretend that all was as before?

120
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:34,383
Accept that you care more about your boat
and your money than you care about me

121
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:42,073
Yeah well, your father did not need
controlling all my life paranoid

122
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,304
Not talking about my
father, talked to us

123
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:51,031
You chose a different life
is fine, I understand

124
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,711
And it seems that you are happy
with the decision you made

125
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,093
You better back in does not
want to miss your party

126
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,122
Good lord the Titanic
time goes well

127
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:37,098
Wait, hold it steady

128
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,978
We are stable, naval readings
to 31 degrees

129
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,917
- Is it true?.
- How so?

130
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,639
The same reading
as 100 years ago

131
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:55,673
Well, only this time we
have enough lifeboats

132
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,648
I also believe that this time
also avoid the icebergs

133
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:01,950
Yes sir

134
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:09,784
Lord, I have to remind

135
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,857
We have not yet deployed
the propellers

136
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:14,688
- Yes ... we need to accelerate
- Relax

137
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:19,115
May resemble its predecessor
but inside is much better

138
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:23,101
Yes sir

139
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:31,694
- How long before we collapse?
- Hard to say

140
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:36,774
But when you do the North Atlantic
will be devastated by the wave

141
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:04,138
What was that?

142
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:14,541
Go back

143
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:51,250
Upload

144
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:02,760
Now Mr

145
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,865
is tracking the satellite

146
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:07,717
But we do not have much
time to report

147
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,281
- A tsunami alert.
- James I already did

148
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:13,544
The warning is being
given at this time

149
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:18,786
We will need the navy, coast
guard, national guard

150
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,564
and all we can when
this thing hit

151
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:26,979
- How long do we have
- I can see

152
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:28,566
No time

153
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:32,078
Hand me the alert center readers
are going to need SNA

154
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:34,898
We have to find out how
fast this thing moves

155
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:38,647
And send me all the information
we need to move fast

156
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,262
Sir and vessels are at sea?

157
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:46,634
The boats are well, the Tsunami is dangerous
only when it reaches the coast

158
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,927
Ships at sea should
not be affected

159
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,892
That's not entirely true captain
of the surface ships maybe yes

160
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:59,462
But everything below will be affected particularly
throughout the north Atlantic

161
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,627
- Ice?
- Exactly

162
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:06,691
There may be a layer of ice beneath the
surface in several feet produndidad

163
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,033
So if the wave strikes, can push

164
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:10,868
Okay

165
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,120
Abo, listen

166
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:15,632
We need to send a warning

167
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:20,752
All the ships of the Atlantic tell them
not to come to any signs of ice

168
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,246
Again tell them to stay away
from the ice blocks

169
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:28,201
- Consider it done James
- And one more thing

170
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:32,759
- Do you also have a view on the Titanic?.
- We are monitoring all James

171
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:36,052
- What you need
- check what is the
marina in the area

172
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:39,590
- Check your position
- Copying

173
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:52,054
- Sir, we have redirected.
- Where?

174
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:57,177
North Latitude 40 º 45
West Longitude 50 º 14

175
00:26:57,196 --> 00:26:59,812
We'll confirm it's okay

176
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,250
Let's move

177
00:27:15,214 --> 00:27:19,344
Speak the Coast Guard is a Tsunami
alert in the North Atlantic

178
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,799
Again there is a warning ...

179
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,005
Captain

180
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:28,705
Did you know that the Titanic was warned
six times on icebergs and did nothing?

181
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,377
Ignoring his position was true

182
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,378
On hate

183
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,592
- Nursing.
- Ladies I need one
of you in the port

184
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:44,074
- We are in the midst of an important conversation.
- No matter

185
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:47,842
I need one of you
to get passengers

186
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:48,950
We are on track

187
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,311
Why are escorting passengers
to the lower chambers?

188
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,492
Yes sir

189
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:06,344
Good evening ladies and gentlemen can
provide me your attention please

190
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:10,841
All passengers of the
Titanic please

191
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:13,889
Come by my front door and
go to the elevators

192
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:18,586
And go to the ground floor
this is a precaution

193
00:29:18,604 --> 00:29:20,959
No need to worry thanks

194
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,717
- How long?.
- Just M.

195
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:31,420
- The Coast Guard gave the alert.
- Coast Guard

196
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:34,773
- What the hell caused it?
- An iceberg collapsed

197
00:29:34,787 --> 00:29:38,473
- On the coast of Greenland
- We are ready for icebergs

198
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:43,581
Not the lord but the Tsunami
iceberg coming fast sir

199
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,672
How long?

200
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:53,843
- We are waiting for the Coast Guard.
- Captain, that we
will pass under

201
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,865
- Do not even feel.
- Coast Guard Captain
communication

202
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:02,086
- Here the Captain Howard.
- Captain James Howard here on
Maine Coast Guard Captain

203
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:03,405
We listened

204
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,351
- Do you see any iceberg in your area?
- Mr Negative

205
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:11,764
Lord I need to reverse the
direction of your boat

206
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:14,452
Mr.

207
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:18,979
This wave is moving with
incredible strength

208
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:22,127
Any ice on the way
the wave moves

209
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:26,990
I need you to contact the
West as soon as possible

210
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:30,431
It is the only chance
to avoid ice

211
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,906
For God's sake James I know
this looks dangerous

212
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,379
But I remind you that this
is the Titanic II

213
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:40,876
Equipped with radar ice that are activated
within a radius of 5 yards

214
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:45,481
Hayden this wave travels
at 842 miles per hour

215
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:48,790
Now 5 yards will not
make a difference

216
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:52,400
If any ice will reach
you flip the boat

217
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:56,954
Do what it says.
How long do we have?

218
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:02,505
- How long for the impact?
- 15 minutes maximum

219
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,282
They have 15 minutes maximum

220
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:08,240
God

221
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:30,772
- What is our distance?
- 40 degrees and heading
northeast at 30 miles

222
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,090
- How long?.
- Mr Anytime

223
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,276
- Shoot. - Lord if you do ...
- Do

224
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,118
Mr. 2000 ... 5000 meters
Lord strike us

225
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:08,008
Prepare for impact

226
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,446
- Captain at 50 knots.
- We're in 40

227
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,504
- It's not fast enough.
- Mr Walsh, I can remember ...

228
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:40,813
The engines are not
well tested yet

229
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,842
- If the press ...
- They have been built
to withstand speed

230
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:53,254
- Put them in 50.
- Yes sir

231
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,809
- Put in 50 knots
- Yes sir

232
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:19,950
All to please the ground floor
there is no need to panic

233
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:21,866
- Madeleine.
- People are going crazy

234
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:25,294
- What?
- You think climate caution

235
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:29,050
- Is all this fuss about the weather?.
- That's all they told me

236
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,442
If something is wrong

237
00:33:58,183 --> 00:33:59,286
We answer Amy

238
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,246
Hello, just call Amy Maine leave
a message after the tone

239
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:07,520
Amy talks to you about
your dad, listen

240
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:13,992
Something is happening, there is a tsunami
that will go through the North Atlantic

241
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:17,462
Your boat will reach in a few minutes
I want you to pay attention

242
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:20,846
Away from the ground floor

243
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,791
There are chunks of ice
in your direction

244
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:27,484
Take as many people as possible
to higher levels

245
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,671
Stay in the center of the boat

246
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,842
And if something happens, permance
calm and get on a lifeboat

247
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:42,123
- Be careful honey.
- Is your daughter?

248
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,155
- Yes, a nurse.
- Lord

249
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,474
We have very little fuel M.

250
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,624
- Where you can stock up?
- In the Canadian coast

251
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:56,085
- In the San Juan hub.
- Take us there faster

252
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:57,598
Yes sir

253
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:04,983
- We are at 50 knots Captain.
- Very well

254
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,381
- Lord lost the first mover.
- Turn it off

255
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:18,238
- We can not.
- We can not lose the other

256
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:19,321
We can not stop this ship

257
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,317
- This boat has three engines.
- Do you want to
fly the other 3?

258
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:36,235
We both know that the engines have not been
properly installed, have to be cooled

259
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,824
- Turbines.
- The turbine will
consume more fuel

260
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:40,909
We can not let go slow

261
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:54,587
We are adrift

262
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:06,024
We turn on the alarm
being dragged

263
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:10,518
Keep calm happens all the time

264
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:15,737
Happens all the time make
it right and climb

265
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,279
the pattern is well

266
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,854
Attention, Captain speaking

267
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:26,354
All passengers please
lifejackets

268
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:30,507
All passengers please
lifejackets

269
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:33,481
This is not a drill I
repeat, not a drill

270
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:37,367
Attention, attention

271
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:39,395
Your captain speaking

272
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:42,757
All passengers please
lifejackets

273
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:46,803
All passengers please
lifejackets

274
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:49,969
This is not a drill,
I repeat not a drill

275
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:55,303
This is not a drill,
I repeat not a drill

276
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:03,890
I know the same thing I'm sorry
you'll find information

277
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,553
Talk to them and let you know

278
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:08,881
No, no panic stop

279
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:38,358
Captain

280
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:04,629
Everybody Moving

281
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,608
- A starboard now
- We hit

282
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:59,900
Maidem, maidem this is the Titanic II calling the U.S.
Coast Guard

283
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:05,387
Maidem, maidem this is the Titanic II calling the U.S.
Coast Guard

284
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:09,674
Titanic II, Captain James Maine speaks of the U.S.
Coast Guard

285
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:14,495
- What is your situation?
- Mr collided with an iceberg

286
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:18,287
- We need immediate assistance.
- Captain I think we
have another problem

287
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,188
We filled it with water

288
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:56,697
All the bow water is
filling up fast

289
00:39:57,442 --> 00:40:01,856
That will cut the power
to lower the lifeboats

290
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,442
- How many?
- Of all

291
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,539
- We have a dinghy.
- And the boats tied?

292
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,784
They are small or even float

293
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:13,197
- The little pot.
- They were not designed
to withstand a collision

294
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:16,638
- Not anticipate being beaten by his side.
- What is he saying?

295
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:18,581
We must continue

296
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:22,966
- If we keep filling our water we will sink.
- How long?

297
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,551
- 2 hours, maybe three.
- What else?

298
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:29,765
We sink

299
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:36,628
- Prepare all is well and evacuate
all the boats that we have

300
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:38,627
Women and children first

301
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:41,202
It seems that history
repeats itself

302
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,067
Mr Walsh have to remove it.
Come on, we need him to safety

303
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,688
Let

304
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:29,308
- Between sir.
- And the passengers?

305
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:32,541
We have to upload the fix

306
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:56,307
Listen to me, goes to most people
as possible in the helicopter

307
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,407
- Mr Walsh is the procedure
- the procedure I do not care

308
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,807
- It's my boat, do it
- Yes sir

309
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:07,284
Okay, you catch me out of here

310
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:18,842
Arise

311
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:28,589
I have received under
the glacier activity

312
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:30,208
Near the area of collapse

313
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,920
If successful will mean
that unstable ice

314
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:36,010
What are you saying?

315
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:38,671
If collapses

316
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,138
A greater mass of ice fall
into the Atlantic

317
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:44,176
Creating a mega tsunami toward
the Atlantic Coast

318
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:46,119
How big?

319
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,394
Everything in its path
will be devastated

320
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,507
We have to get people
out of the Titanic II

321
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:01,131
James we have a rescue squad

322
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,707
The marina is 40 miles
west of them

323
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:05,911
They will find the
Titanic in an hour

324
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:10,235
That boat does not have an hour

325
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:13,432
We need planes and helicopters
in the area immediately

326
00:43:14,672 --> 00:43:17,732
Captain of the Titanic
have enough boats

327
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,374
We may not have seen the
end of this collapse

328
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:26,671
if there is another wave, these
boats will not change anything

329
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,143
And my daughter is in that boat

330
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:35,150
I understand

331
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,723
Everyone calm

332
00:43:46,738 --> 00:43:50,014
No, please sir

333
00:43:50,475 --> 00:43:53,774
Let me let go

334
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,159
- Lord have to go back.
- Please Lord ago

335
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:01,863
Come women we

336
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:05,188
Sorry we have to go

337
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,318
Madeline helps

338
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,727
- Amy.
- Come

339
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:13,926
Let me help you

340
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:17,970
Ladies first

341
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,073
No, I'm staying here I'll stay

342
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,920
One more go

343
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:26,507
Only women

344
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:55,775
- How far?
- 30 minutes Mr

345
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:57,747
We will supply us

346
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:01,159
There's a boat on the way
if we do not reach

347
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,733

Half of the boats have
been evacuated

416

I do not know, I think
they flew turbines

433
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:09,526
Everything will collapse

434
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:14,062
- You're bleeding. - I'm fine.
- I have to get points

435
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:17,203
I'll tell you if we
leave it alive

436
00:56:17,188 --> 00:56:20,999
I'll let me put all the points

- Are you in a lifeboat?

445
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:14,348
The ship is sinking
How do you catch?

446
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:18,687
Kelly Hayden and I are
stuck in an elevator

447
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:25,422
Hear, hear help is on the way

448
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:26,494
I also

00:57:28,259 --> 00:57:31,490
I want them to stay away
from the lifeboats

450
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:34,545
- Do not get any.

Cariño another wave is on its
way bigger than the last

Not survive

455
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:55,600
Your best bet is to
stay in the boat

456
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:01,271
You can flip but it is strong
and the wave drag is not

564
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:04,431

01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:09,339

01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:24,756

568
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:35,045

Arms

576
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:19,443
We have to go

577
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:36,906
- How much is missing?
- We are close to Mr

578
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:39,238
Within 30 miles of the east side

579
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:42,696
- Think I'll make it
- We are near

580
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:49,427
Amy you ok?

581
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,550
Yes What happened?

582
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:57,767
We headed the ship
is upside down

583
01:11:58,061 --> 01:12:00,450
- Can you move?
- Yes

584
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:03,329
We have to go, stop

585
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:11,717
- Give me your hand.
- Is frozen

586
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:14,434
We have to go give me your hand

587
01:12:16,713 --> 01:12:18,032
Are you okay?
- Yes

588
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,650
- Something is blocking the door.
- What can we do?

589
01:12:34,097 --> 01:12:37,487
- The water will rise faster
- Everything will be under
water in 5 minutes

590
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:41,078
You have to get it

591
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:45,167
Amy Turn around

592
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,404
You have to leave

593
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:58,376
- Those are the planes?
- Yes if you came
to the room dive

594
01:12:58,388 --> 01:12:59,571
They will be there

595
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,259
No good

596
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,397
Each unit has a diving
emergency tracker

597
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:17,597
- How it works
- have a tracking signal

598
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:21,017
A low frequency we have

599
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:24,959
Hayden is frozen water

600
01:13:24,981 --> 01:13:28,030
I'll keep you warm

601
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:32,607
Do you?

602
01:13:34,424 --> 01:13:36,073
I think the temperature is
the least of my concerns

603
01:13:43,066 --> 01:13:45,921
Lord I have a low
frequency signal

604
01:13:46,302 --> 01:13:49,624
- Seems to come from the Titanic II
- Mira

605
01:13:58,348 --> 01:13:59,519
How to get there?

606
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:04,372
Listen, I take off the suit

607
01:14:04,354 --> 01:14:07,517
Why? I use it not Forget

608
01:14:07,523 --> 01:14:08,660
Freeze to death

609
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:11,178
First I'll drown

610
01:14:12,629 --> 01:14:15,655
We will share the oxygen
tank to keep breathing

611
01:14:15,665 --> 01:14:19,999
- No. - Why?
- Freeze to death anyway

612
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,096
So what's your plan?

613
01:14:26,643 --> 01:14:29,988
Listen, this boat has air bags

614
01:14:30,647 --> 01:14:32,217
Caught

615
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:37,611
Stop the sinking air
that will give me

616
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:41,873
Breathe deep and try to get

617
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:45,720
- Wait ...
- Insurance and picked
up your signal

618
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:46,888
- Wait.
- You can find

619
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:48,830
- What about you?
- I'll drown

620
01:14:49,966 --> 01:14:52,810
If they can survive rapid

621
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:56,827
- No. - It is the only way
- No, Hayden

622
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:59,273
Listen, be wise

623
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:03,371
If we share the tank
will die anyway

624
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,202
And half of the air will

625
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:08,894
I swear can relive

626
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:12,649
You have more chance of survival

627
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:15,072
But I do not like you

628
01:15:21,064 --> 01:15:23,430
- This is my fault.
- No

629
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:27,305
Come on, give me your arm

630
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:47,725
- What is your plan?
- I have to find

631
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:50,894
- How will you know where?
- No need to know

632
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:57,707
- James if the ship sinks, the pressure will increase.
- I know

633
01:15:58,468 --> 01:16:02,871
- Everything that is below ...
- Yes, you have to take care

634
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:08,119
- Here, take the end of it, and let me go
- What's this?

635
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:12,551
To find the way back there
you have 1000 feet

636
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:15,734
Just let it go I'll be fine

637
01:16:19,856 --> 01:16:22,188
- What if the string ends?
- I'll be dead

638
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,898
- Then cut the rope.
- M. Ready

639
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:27,238
Now

640
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:41,466
- Hayden
- Sorry

641
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:47,641
- No holding out.
- No, no, no

642
01:16:49,218 --> 01:16:53,382
Amy, I did what did you
do what you gotta do

643
01:16:56,626 --> 01:16:58,378
- Yes
- Then I wake up

644
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:09,585
Put it

645
01:17:23,853 --> 01:17:25,184
Put the controller

646
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:34,740
You'll have to jump

647
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,532
There is a lifesaving equipment
you have to hurry back

648
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:46,246
- What about you?
- I will do my

649
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:47,500
Go

650
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:55,044
You have to hurry, jump

651
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:38,878
Post it

652
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:45,105
1 ... 2 ...

Hayden Resist

654
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:57,157
We breathe

655
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:08,809
We Hayden

656
01:23:22,978 --> 01:23:24,627
Hayden breathes

657
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:35,345
