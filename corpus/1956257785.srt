1
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,311
- Hey!
- C'mon, c'mon!

2
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,672
Hey!

3
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,343
Hey!

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,114
Idiot!

5
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,687
Jerk!

6
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,423
Don't.

7
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,971
Maybe we can go to a counselor
or something.

8
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,573
You just don't get it, do you?

9
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,029
I don't to be your wife anymore.

10
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,381
I want to be me for a while.

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,206
I'm not stopping you from being you.

12
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,098
Yeah.

13
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,604
As long as being me
means being Mrs. Hank Miller.

14
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,651
Not anymore.

15
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,204
It'll be a fresh start
for the both of us.

16
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,194
I don't want a fresh start.

17
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,948
<i>Pick her up.</i>

18
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,430
Hey!

19
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,261
What are you doing?
You are not picking her up!

20
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,656
Hey!

21
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,128
What's wrong with you people?

22
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,010
We should have picked her up.

23
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,453
<i>Pick her up.</i>

24
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,620
Hey! Get in!

25
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,073
Where are you going?

26
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,839
It doesn't matter.
Just get in!

27
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,800
We are lucky I came along when I did.
The storms are getting crazy.

28
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,235
So, how long have you
been out there?

29
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,074
All day.

30
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,474
That's terrible, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:35,585
- My name's Melissa.
- I'm Kayla.

32
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,085
You're not from around here,
are you?

33
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,235
Not really.

34
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,024
Running away?

35
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:52,058
So that either means yes or mind
your business, Melissa. Which is it?

36
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,311
I'm just passing through.

37
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,842
Well, there's a lot
to pass through here.

38
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,002
I noticed.

39
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,452
Where are you headed?

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,790
Winnemucca.

41
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,593
- Where's that?
- Up north.

42
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:16,044
My boyfriend's a mining engineer,
I'm paying him a surprise.

43
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,699
Cool.

44
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,286
Where are you headed?

45
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,736
Winnemucca?

46
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,383
Good one, Kayla.

47
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,532
Now, there's a guy
with a sense of humor.

48
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,432
.

49
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,616
What do you say we stop
and get you a bite to eat?

50
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,748
Let's just keep going
if you don't mind.

51
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,519
Oh, no!

52
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,570
No, you've got to be kidding me!

53
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,171
This is just great.

54
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,636
I'm afraid you'll have
to turn back, sir.

55
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,778
This road is out
until further notice.

56
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,311
The detour told me
to go this way.

57
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,835
It's not like we plan
these things.

58
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,490
Any idea how long it will be
before they open the road?

59
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:54,887
Until some bureaucrat from the State Highway
Administration gives it the all clear.

60
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,575
Okay.

61
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,792
What's the problem, officer?

62
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,900
Road's out, sir.

63
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,330
It's out?

64
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:18,801
We've got a flash flood warning.
It's dangerous at the moment.

65
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,341
Okay.

66
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,444
Thanks for bringing me out here.

67
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,483
It's not my fault.

68
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,473
What's going on?

69
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,182
That's the guy who
almost ran me down!

70
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,338
You know what this means?

71
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,906
I've got go all the way back
to the interstate

72
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,543
all way up to Silverton
and then back down again.

73
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,852
140 extra miles to get some place
that's only twenty miles from here.

74
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,734
Sorry for the inconvenience.

75
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,486
Hey, aren't you Crusher Crocetti?

76
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,249
If I say yes,
will you let me through?

77
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,972
Does anyone have a working cell?

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,437
No! Mine broke when you almost
ran me over!

79
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,950
That was an accident.

80
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,589
Sorry about not picking you up,

81
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,530
but my wife is kind of nervous
about picking hitchhikers.

82
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:27,502
No problem. I had hours before
I would have died of exposure.

83
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,754
I think they might have a phone
back at that diner.

84
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,129
- What diner?
- That diner a couple miles back.

85
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,328
There hasn't been a building in this road
for the last fifty miles.

86
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,064
It was called Last Chance Diner.

87
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,493
Last Chance Diner?
Now that's rich.

88
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,964
Do you remember
seeing the diner?

89
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:48,594
Sorry to contradict,
but I do believe that diner is closed.

90
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,900
It looked open to me.

91
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,563
So there is a diner?

92
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,153
There was a diner.

93
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,430
You guys can do whatever you want, but I'm going
to go back and check it out, okay? Let's go.

94
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:31,073
Tell guy at the diner
officer DeVille sent you.

95
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,436
Hello? Anybody home?

96
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,849
Hello?

97
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,206
Hello!

98
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,898
Please, have a seat anywhere.

99
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:47,668
The State Trooper down the road
said you guys were closed.

100
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,337
He's been trying to keep people
away from me for years.

101
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,315
It's a personal thing.

102
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,653
Would you like some water?

103
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,779
Yeah.

104
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,801
You got a phone?

105
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,258
Do you have any coffee?

106
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,257
I'm sorry,
all we serve here is water.

107
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,104
You have got to be kidding me.

108
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,217
This tastes great.

109
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,022
It's my own recipe.

110
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,389
Two molecules of hydrogen
and one of oxygen.

111
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,343
This phone's dead.

112
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,250
Yes, the storm probably knocked down
the phonelines.

113
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,561
It's a miracle
we have electricity working.

114
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,230
Isn't it, Crusher?

115
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,844
Crusher Crocetti!
I thought I recognized you.

116
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,842
I can't say I ever rooted for you,
though. I'm a Rams fan.

117
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,121
But I can't lie,
I do love your burgers.

118
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,634
Here.

119
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,517
Good for two Crusher Burger meals.

120
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,111
Thanks, Mr. Crocetti.

121
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,760
Can we get some menus?

122
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,303
Sure, but I'll tell you what, since you'll
probably be my only customers tonight,

123
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,225
I'll just make
whatever you want.

124
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,866
I'd prefer a menu.

125
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,271
Yes, ma'am.

126
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,681
Jesus.

127
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,355
Most people pronounce it Jesus.

128
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:19,027
Nice name.
Religious.

129
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,084
It doesn't really have
anything to do with religion.

130
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,975
It was my father's idea.

131
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:28,184
I don't know, that I'd have the name Jesus
I'd be expected to know everything.

132
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,979
Try me.

133
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,316
Here we go.

134
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,946
Ma'am.

135
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,674
Would you like a menu?

136
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,371
Hank?

137
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,119
Sure, thanks.

138
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,308
How'd he know my name?

139
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,959
- What?
- He called me Hank.

140
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,569
- That's your name, isn't it?
- Yeah, but how did he know?

141
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,298
Just stop.

142
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,388
Ladies, what would you like?

143
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,597
What would you recommend?

144
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,063
Excellent question.

145
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:21,740
You know, I have a special knack
for knowing exactly what people want.

146
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:27,378
Of course, what they need
is an entirely different matter.

147
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,410
Don't people want what they need?

148
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:33,119
Not necessarily, in fact,
most of the time people don't.

149
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,013
Your recommendation then, sir.

150
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,541
Okay.
I think you would like...

151
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:43,165
sirloin tips smothered in gravy,

152
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,003
on a bed of mashed potatoes
with a garden salad on the side,

153
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,929
and thousand island dressing.

154
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,183
That's what my mother always made
for my birthday.

155
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,582
Your mother loves you very much.

156
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,584
She did.

157
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,957
She died last year.

158
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,898
It doesn't mean
she stopped loving you.

159
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,281
What about me?

160
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,470
What do I want?

161
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:16,892
You want many things, young lady,
all of which you don't necessarily need.

162
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:21,134
But as far as dinner is concerned, I think
you would like a gigantic beef burrito

163
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:26,555
with black beans and rice and sour cream
and pico de gallo on the side.

164
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,905
I thought so.

165
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,372
Let me get you some bread.

166
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,284
Hey!

167
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,743
How much is it gonna cost?

168
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,928
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

169
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:44,849
No, I don't to be dependent
on anyone anymore.

170
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,090
- I pay my own way.
- Okay, okay.

171
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,012
But how's this?

172
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:53,970
All special orders are free!

173
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,713
My personal gift to you.

174
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,632
If it's free, it must not
be worth having.

175
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,272
I guarantee you, Nick,

176
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,147
this an offer you don't want
to pass up.

177
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,516
I'd like to ask,
are you able to do it?

178
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,419
One business man to another,

179
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:14,120
but I see that what you lose in food
you save elsewhere like this newspaper.

180
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,219
It's fifty years old!

181
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,755
Yeah, it belonged
to the previous owner.

182
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,392
And you just left it
sitting here?

183
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,268
It reminds me of the original owner.
Stan Kostek was his name.

184
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,489
A very sweet guy.

185
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:33,312
He was sitting in this very seat reading
the newspaper after the morning rush.

186
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:38,417
Tell me, what's the most popular section
of the newspaper? Hank?

187
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,968
Sports?

188
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,659
The obituaries.

189
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,987
Right, the obituaries.

190
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:50,553
He was sitting here
reading the obituaries,

191
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:54,077
not knowing that
the very next day

192
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,397
he would be in the obituaries
himself.

193
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,314
If only he had known.

194
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,555
I don't get it.

195
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,863
Maybe he's telling us that we're
going to be in the newspaper tomorrow.

196
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,526
Perhaps.

197
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,675
You're the one with
the decision to make.

198
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,850
What will be?
Menu or a special order?

199
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,120
Well,

200
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:24,050
I think I'll take the special order,
if only to hear what you think I want.

201
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,997
Well, I think you've had enough burgers
to last your lifetime,

202
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:33,506
so what you think about a thick porterhouse steak
and a baked potato and some summer squash?

203
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,348
And don't forget a nice slice of
cherry pie fresh from the windowsill.

204
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,467
It's a good choice, Jesus.

205
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,029
Only make the steak
a little rare.

206
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,709
I am here to serve.

207
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,657
What would you like?

208
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,996
I'll take the chicken Caesar salad
and a diet coke.

209
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,753
I'm sorry, all we serve here
is water.

210
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,906
You don't have a diet coke?

211
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,918
Fine, I'll have water.

212
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:16,385
And I'll have a bacon cheeseburger
and a diet coke.

213
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,832
All I serve here is water.

214
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,610
Okay, I'll have water.

215
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,905
Would you like fries
with your cheeseburger?

216
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:35,033
You know, there's something a little disconcerting
about a man named Jesus asking me if I want fries.

217
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,618
That's a simple question, sir.

218
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,875
- No, thanks.
- Go ahead.

219
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,913
I don't care what you do anymore.

220
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:54,602
- Yeah, I'll have French fries.
- Excellent choice, Hank.

221
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,006
How'd you know my name?

222
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,286
Well, it's Hank!

223
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:02,510
Isn't it, Catherine?

224
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,353
Hey, how did you know our names?

225
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:09,288
I'm Jesus.
I know everything.

226
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,319
I know all of you.

227
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,501
I've known you since before
you were born.

228
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:24,369
And I've got a plan for each
of you. A perfect plan.

229
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:29,229
All you have to do
is believe in me.

230
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,616
Well, folks,
I don't know about the rest of you,

231
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,695
but I'm due back
on the planet earth now.

232
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,987
So, if you don't mind,
we will be leaving.

233
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,783
Hank?

234
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,055
Fine.

235
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,766
Catherine, wait. Where're you going?
I got the keys to the car.

236
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,449
Catherine, wait.

237
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,414
You can go with me.
I've had enough of this freak show myself.

238
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,999
That's awfully good of you.

239
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,719
You can't leave with my wife.

240
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:07,146
It's obvious she doesn't want
to stay with you. Sorry, pal.

241
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:08,979
Enjoy the food.

242
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,393
Thanks a lot, Jesus.

243
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,923
My wife just left me.

244
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,852
She was going to
leave you anyway, Hank.

245
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:45,239
- Yes, but...
- Don't worry. She'll be back.

246
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:56,262
<i>What a bunch of craziness.</i>

247
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,663
<i>You get that right.</i>

248
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,731
Where am I taking you,
by the way?

249
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,572
Away from here.

250
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:06,483
Seriously, the roads are closed,
I've got to go to Silverton.

251
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:10,695
Silverton is fine.
I can take a bus from there.

252
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,107
No.

253
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,645
I cannot believe this.

254
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:27,216
We have just entered
in the Twilight Zone.

255
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,189
Who are you really?

256
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,818
Who do you say I am, Kayla?

257
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,512
Well, you could be Jesus,

258
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,354
and I could be Britney Spears.

259
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:48,190
Yeah, aren't supposed to be
in heaven or something?

260
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:51,140
What is going to take
to convince you?

261
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:53,532
How's this?

262
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:59,344
Funny.

263
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,598
You know, anyone can get
a fake ID these days.

264
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,906
That's right, Kayla.

265
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,255
Even you.

266
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,070
- How did you know that?
- I'm Jesus, I know everything.

267
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:20,649
Melissa, for example, is heading up to Winnemucca
for the weekend to visit her boyfriend, Paul.

268
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,843
She thinks he's going
to propose to her.

269
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:25,273
Is he?

270
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,798
Yes!

271
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:32,281
I wouldn't be so excited
if I were you.

272
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:38,169
Melissa, do you really want to marry a man that makes
you drive four 100 miles just to propose to you?

273
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,134
You're a woman, you're precious.

274
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:43,603
I've got better for you
than that.

275
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:46,098
What about me, Jesus?

276
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,777
What do you know about me
besides my name?

277
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,064
I know your wife no longer
wants to be Mrs. Hank Miller.

278
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,038
Is that true?

279
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,180
It is true.

280
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,636
Look, I don't know who you are, but you
have no right to interfere in my marriage.

281
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,473
I'm not interfering
in your marriage, Hank.

282
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,785
I can save your marriage.

283
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,724
How could you save my marriage?

284
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,087
All you have to do is ask me.

285
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,700
Jesus...

286
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,153
save my marriage.

287
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:48,214
Save my marriage, please,
Lord Jesus.

288
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,515
Save my marriage.

289
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,534
I can't believe, it!

290
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,132
We've got go back in there.

291
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:20,066
I will walk to Silverton
before I go back in there.

292
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:24,120
He may be crazy,
but he's probably harmless.

293
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,968
Probably?

294
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,014
- Back so soon?
- Car didn't start.

295
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,528
Aren't you worried
about your meeting?

296
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:10,992
Your franchisees meeting.
You've got what, 1,100 restaurants now?

297
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,988
We'll be more like 3,000
by the end of next year.

298
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,465
It's impressive.

299
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,254
Nick,

300
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:21,898
I can offer you greater riches.

301
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:27,584
Riches that can never be lost
or stolen or sunk by the stock market.

302
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,421
That's real good, Jesus.

303
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:46,642
- Catherine...
- Hank, please.

304
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,810
I meant what I said.

305
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,474
Is there somebody else?

306
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:55,367
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We can save our marriage.

307
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,001
It's too late.

308
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,033
Jesus can save our marriage.

309
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:01,570
- You mean your friend over there?
- Yes.

310
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:03,321
He knows we're headed
for a divorce.

311
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:07,262
Does he?
Well, that puts him one up on you.

312
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:17,372
Hey, did you eat all the bread?

313
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,175
Sorry. I was hungry.

314
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,526
Hey, can we get
more bread over here?

315
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:26,868
There is plenty of bread there.

316
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:30,444
No, there isn't. It's...

317
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:33,421
empty.

318
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:38,525
How did you do that?

319
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,105
I'm Jesus.

320
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:47,781
Will you come with me, please?

321
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,977
Sure.

322
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,815
Well, as long as you are performing miracles,
why don't you turn my water into wine?

323
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,795
Am I losing my mind?

324
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:05,617
That breadbasket was empty.

325
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:10,361
- Wasn't it?
- I thought it was.

326
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:14,527
And then suddenly
it wasn't empty.

327
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,828
Doesn't that freak you out?

328
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:23,019
You haven't been
some of the places I've been.

329
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,634
Plus, it was your idea
to come here.

330
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,883
Suppose.

331
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,054
Suppose it really is...

332
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,834
him?

333
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,768
- Jesus?
- Yeah.

334
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:43,816
Please!

335
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:48,084
How did he know that stuff
about my boyfriend?

336
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,782
He probably just
overheard us talking.

337
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,643
No.

338
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,396
We didn't talk about that in there.

339
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:00,065
Look, I don't know
what the explanation is,

340
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:02,884
but I'm sure there is one.

341
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,252
It's not so bad here,
there's free food and it's a warm place.

342
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:09,398
So, you can leave, but...

343
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,716
I'm staying.

344
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:42,132
You shall see the Son of Man
sitting at the right hand of Power

345
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,018
and coming on the clouds of heaven.

346
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:50,465
Your good book forgot to mention that
there'd be a chance of scattered showers.

347
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,564
I'm glad to see that you remember some
of what you read in the Bible, Nick.

348
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:56,975
Specially that part, that's like
one of my favorite parts.

349
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,582
You can thank Gideons for that.

350
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:04,017
There's no telling what a man will do
at 3 AM in a Day's Inn outside Fargo.

351
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,929
You were searching, Nick.

352
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,387
I was bored.

353
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:11,562
Bored people turn on the TV.
You opened the Bible.

354
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:13,470
What were you looking for?

355
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:16,271
You tell me!
You know everything.

356
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:19,221
It was after the death
of your father.

357
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,077
You were wondering how your parents
could be so content with so little.

358
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:25,481
How your father could be as proud
of his fruit stand

359
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:29,113
as you are of your fame
and your millions.

360
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:31,214
I loved your parents.

361
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:34,022
Real, authentic,
hardworking people.

362
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:38,428
More people went to your father's
fruit stand for a smile than for his fruit.

363
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:40,409
And do you know who was great?

364
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:43,343
Your grandmother, Sadie.

365
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,637
I never knew her,
she died when I was little.

366
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,903
Of course you remember her.

367
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,300
In fact, you could say that she is
the reason we're here like this tonight.

368
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:56,769
What do you mean?

369
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:59,682
Your grandmother
was a delight to my heart.

370
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:05,988
A humble woman filled with love
and zeal, a real prayer warrior.

371
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:10,018
In her last years, her most passionate
prayers, Nick, were for you.

372
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,475
She was praying that you'd come to me
as your Lord and your Savior.

373
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:16,729
That you'd come to eternal life.

374
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:21,297
I am honoring her faithfulness by
coming to you to make this personal appeal.

375
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:24,674
Well, but there was no need
to go through all the trouble, Jesus.

376
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,042
Because I'm doing
just fine on my own.

377
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,138
If I hadn't intervened tonight,
you'd be dead.

378
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,967
- You'd all be dead.
- What?

379
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,032
The flooding left the road unstable.
Nick would have hit the curve too hard

380
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,482
and each of you
would have followed him.

381
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:40,037
No, no, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

382
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:44,017
You're trying to take credit for saving
our lives by keeping us off the road,

383
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,589
but if you are indeed God,

384
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,897
then you created the storm
to cause the damage on the road,

385
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:53,303
so if we kept driving, you would
be responsible for our deaths.

386
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:56,263
You live in a
fractured creation.

387
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,936
That's what's responsible
for the storm.

388
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,868
I stepped in and took advantage
of the storm

389
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:05,839
to bring you all here tonight
so I could make this personal appeal.

390
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,404
Okay, Jesus.

391
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:15,992
If you really are the Christ,

392
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:18,861
why don't you tell me something
amazing about myself?

393
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:21,355
Something only I know.

394
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,492
You don't really want to leave
your husband.

395
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:26,585
Wrong.
Our marriage is over.

396
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,838
No, you're only looking
for something he can't provide,

397
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:32,867
and you're not going to find it
on your own either.

398
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,710
I'll take that chance.

399
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:39,912
Catherine, don't be so hard on your husband,
you've got to expect him to believe in me.

400
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,195
He's been listening to my voice
since he was fifteen.

401
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,142
In fact, he heard me
earlier today.

402
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,518
- I did?
- Yes.

403
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,646
I was that still small voice in your head
that told you to pick up Kayla,

404
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,190
but you didn't, did you?

405
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:58,226
I wanted to,

406
00:30:58,258 --> 00:30:59,999
but...

407
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:04,169
But Catherine wouldn't let you.
Am I right?

408
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,905
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

409
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,936
For all I knew,
she was going to kill us.

410
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:10,699
Well, it that's the way you feel,
I probably should have.

411
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:12,512
You see what I mean?

412
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,316
I can't fault you, Catherine.

413
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:18,164
- But I can fault you, Hank.
- Why?

414
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:21,249
- She's here, isn't she?
- Of course.

415
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:25,958
I knew you wouldn't pick her up, so I asked
another one of my servants to do it.

416
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,852
Didn't I?

417
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,212
<i>Pick her up.</i>

418
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,601
That was you?

419
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:38,565
That was not the first time you
heard my voice, nor it would be the last.

420
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,374
You just keep listening.

421
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:43,018
And I guarantee you will find
what you seek.

422
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,011
Hank,

423
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,387
do you really think you're going to save,
let alone restore your marriage

424
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:53,848
by putting your wife's wishes
above mine?

425
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,191
She wants to break up
your marriage, Hank.

426
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:58,185
I want to save it.

427
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:00,756
You've got to be
listening to me.

428
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:04,429
You know, maybe the two of you should
get married and just leave me out of it.

429
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:09,032
Catherine, you've been out of it
for way too long.

430
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:11,839
It's time that you and I met.

431
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:14,573
Are you saying
I am not a Christian?

432
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,742
I'm sorry, you're not.

433
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,581
How dare you?

434
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,178
I go to church every Sunday!

435
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:25,816
- I even teach Sunday School!
- I know.

436
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,554
The sad part is that you would
have peace in your heart today

437
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:32,337
if you had half the faith of some
of those kids in your class.

438
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:37,981
Catherine!

439
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,675
She's only going
to the ladies room, Hank.

440
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:48,582
So, Jesus, if you're everywhere,
aren't you in the ladies room as well?

441
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,180
Nick, you've got
quite a sense of humor,

442
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:53,993
but eventually you will going to find out
that you can't make a joke about everything.

443
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:02,579
Come on.

444
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:04,138
Come on!

445
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,336
Come on!

446
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,905
Great.

447
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:35,257
Go away, Hank!

448
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:39,231
It's not Hank.
It's Melissa.

449
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,800
You are awfully quiet down here.

450
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,268
I haven't that much to say.

451
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:58,831
I've given a lot to think about,
haven't I?

452
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,009
Yeah.

453
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,976
I'll be right back.

454
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:08,736
I'm sorry for being rude earlier.

455
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,176
Everything is such a mess.
Hank and I...

456
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,022
we're drifting apart
for months now.

457
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:24,216
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

458
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:31,601
And why am I telling you this?

459
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,649
Sometimes it's just...

460
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:39,067
easier to talk to a stranger
about these things, you know.

461
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,821
And that...

462
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:44,341
that man out there!

463
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,030
That man who thinks he's Jesus.

464
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:51,184
He thinks he knows me.

465
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:54,630
- Do you think he's Jesus?
- Do you?

466
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,971
Was it true? I mean,

467
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:59,967
that you don't want
to leave your husband?

468
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,418
I don't know what I want.

469
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,086
I just...

470
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:10,960
I want things to be different.

471
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,218
Well, then does it matter
if he really is Jesus?

472
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:18,026
I mean, he obviously knows
a lot about you.

473
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:20,032
Why don't you just...

474
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:23,896
listen to what he has to say?

475
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:26,860
Like he can fix what's wrong
with my marriage.

476
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:29,511
Like you can?

477
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,615
Thank you for picking up Kayla.

478
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,827
- There's no problem.
- I feel terrible about that.

479
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:50,477
Hank, you seem to be really
buying this whole Jesus thing.

480
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:53,199
I am a believer, yes.

481
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,733
But do you believe in that guy?

482
00:35:56,757 --> 00:36:00,398
Either he is who he says he is or...

483
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:01,702
Or what?

484
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,163
Or he's a lunatic.

485
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:06,122
And I've seen no evidence
that he being crazy.

486
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:12,136
Hank, you don't get out
to the big city too much, do you pal?

487
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:16,775
So tell me, Hank,
what do you do for a living?

488
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:20,385
I'm head of accounts receivable
for a home improvement company.

489
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,748
And what do you pull down there?
Ninety?

490
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,973
Come on, you're among friends,
besides, he already knows.

491
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:31,288
Less than that.

492
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,655
Doesn't seem look like God's
been particularly generous to you.

493
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:40,302
No, there's more to life than money.

494
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:44,613
There's family too, and he hasn't done
any favors in that department neither!

495
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:47,528
You know, that's not nice.

496
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:51,257
Am I lying?

497
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,956
Am I?

498
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:56,416
I mean, if that's your way
of rewarding the faithful,

499
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,033
I'm glad I went out and got
what I got on my own.

500
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,396
You wouldn't have anything if I
hadn't put a stone in your path.

501
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:05,700
July 4th, 1974, Elderkin quarry.

502
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:09,731
You and your buddies were racing up the hill to
dive in, and you took a shortcut to the bushes.

503
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:13,131
And you hit your foot on the stone
right before you dove.

504
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,609
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,924
It threw my footing off.

506
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,008
It ruined my dive.

507
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:25,217
Caused me to hit an underwater rock
and broke my hand in two places.

508
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,680
I could have been a receiver.

509
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:32,267
If haven't tripped over that stone, Nick,
you would have hit your head on that rock.

510
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:35,796
You would have died
at fourteen years old.

511
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:37,997
But your grandmother prayers
were ringing in my ears.

512
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:40,551
I put that stone in your path.

513
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:45,505
But, if you really are God, you've
could figured out a way to save him

514
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,410
without breaking his hand.

515
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,609
True, but Kayla,
if nothing had happened,

516
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,368
he wouldn't have remembered it,
and he clearly does.

517
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:57,145
And if he would believe in me he would
see it for what it truly is...

518
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:59,089
my grace.

519
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:02,117
So you hurt him
so he'd thank you later?

520
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:04,027
In a way.

521
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,735
Kayla, you've got to remember,

522
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,788
I'm not the one to put him
on that path.

523
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:11,098
I'm not the one who made him dive.
I'm the one who saved him.

524
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:15,517
Just like I saved you two days ago
in LA before you left.

525
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:18,625
Do you remember, Kayla?

526
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,706
What?
What happened?

527
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,419
Nothing!

528
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,217
I don't know what you did
to that poor girl, but...

529
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,350
if you really are God,
the least you could do

530
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,554
is take care of
my friend Hank here.

531
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,653
At least he believes in you.

532
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:40,461
Hank is going through
a rough spot right now, Nick.

533
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:44,401
But the difference between you and him
is that he knows, in the deep of his heart,

534
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:49,136
that all things work together for the good of those
who love God, and are called to His purpose.

535
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:53,976
So I guess when that drunk driver killed my father,
that was your way of patting him on the back?

536
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,039
Nick, your father enjoyed his life,

537
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:01,076
but he's enjoying his eternal life
a whole lot more right now.

538
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,145
And I want you to see him.

539
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:07,785
Well, excuse me if I don't take upon
that offer. But many do, don't they?

540
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:11,354
How many people are going to blow themselves
up in your name in the Middle East?

541
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,433
In my name, none.

542
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,994
What about the people who
blow up abortion clinics?

543
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,664
I've never wanted to ask anyone
to blow up an abortion clinic.

544
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:24,836
But you do remember telling the Israelites to kill the
Canaanites before they entered the Promised Land.

545
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,403
Men, women and children.

546
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,198
Even the livestock.

547
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,478
Today we have a word for that.
Genocide.

548
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:35,817
For an unbeliever,
you know your Bible very well, Nick.

549
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:37,732
Answer the question.

550
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,889
- Perfect timing.
- No, no, no, no.

551
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:43,315
I'm not gonna let him off
that easy. I want an answer.

552
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:48,531
Yes, I asked the Israelites
to kill the Canaanites.

553
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,491
- Women and children included?
- Yes.

554
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,097
Is that anyway
for a God of Love to behave?

555
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:57,701
I am love, but I am also holy,

556
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:02,510
and I cannot allow sin to go unpunished.
That's not just for my sake, it's for yours.

557
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:07,213
I don't want you to wallow in sin
and rebellion and guilt.

558
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:10,609
I want you to thrive
an unending peace and joy.

559
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:13,523
There's no human being in this planet
that's an accident.

560
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:16,790
I hand formed you
in your mother's womb.

561
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:18,592
And I formed you for a purpose.

562
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,102
I put before you a path
of love and worship.

563
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:28,237
And the degree that you experience
the love and joy

564
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,219
and the good things of life

565
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:33,239
is the degree to which
you bent to my will.

566
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:37,170
And if we don't seek your will, you
kill us like you did to the Canaanites.

567
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,344
Everyone dies, Nick.

568
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:42,650
But not everyone
needs to fear death.

569
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:48,752
If you abide in me, you will be stepping
free from this fallen world

570
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,739
and into glory.

571
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:53,646
Is that what heaven's like?

572
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:55,980
Glory?

573
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:59,500
It's more than glory, Melissa.

574
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:02,667
It's peace, and love, and joy.

575
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:08,021
Can you imagine living in the fullness
of the warmth of God's light?

576
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:12,475
There are no words in the human
vocabulary that can describe it.

577
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:14,680
It's a place where
there's no suffering.

578
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:17,416
It's a place where every tear
is wiped form your eyes.

579
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:20,425
There's no sadness,
there's no pain.

580
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,919
And you know, Melissa?
One day you and I

581
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:28,582
will walk on the streets of gold and
we'll talk about this night together.

582
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,516
What about me, Jesus?

583
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:35,568
Will I walk the streets of gold?

584
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:37,064
Nick,

585
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:41,589
that's completely up to you.

586
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:47,806
Melissa made her decision
on the 232nd day of her 17th year.

587
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,481
That was her birthday
into my kingdom.

588
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:54,539
Why don't you tell Nick
all about it?

589
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:57,174
Tell him why you sought me.

590
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:58,923
I'd like to hear it.

591
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:00,545
So would I.

592
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,505
Well, I was depressed.

593
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:08,787
The guy that I had been dating
broke up with me, so...

594
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:13,480
it was all I could do,
so I would...

595
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,368
come home and just...

596
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:19,626
sleep and cry,

597
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,054
sleep and cry and...

598
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:24,695
eat.

599
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,520
It got to so bad that I was...

600
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,883
thinking about taking my own life.

601
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:36,700
I stole a bottle of painkillers
from my mother's house.

602
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:40,820
I was planning on taking all them
and going to bed

603
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,075
and never waking up.

604
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:46,967
And the phone rang,

605
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,583
for whatever reason
I picked it up.

606
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:52,838
And it was a friend from work.

607
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:55,399
And she was a Christian,

608
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,738
and she always talked about
God and Bible.

609
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,364
And she said she was coming
to pick me up and take me to a movie,

610
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,061
and I... I thought why not?

611
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,647
<i>So, half an hour later,</i>

612
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:12,333
<i>I was seating in the movie theater</i>

613
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,329
and it was packed.

614
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,379
It turned out it was
like a Christian Film Festival.

615
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,686
And this movie was...

616
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:30,857
unlike anything
I'd ever seen before.

617
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:36,262
It was as if the message was
directed at me.

618
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:39,801
I remember tearing up.

619
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:44,309
Yeah, I can't help myself.

620
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:48,724
At the end of the movie a man went
to the front and began to speak.

621
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,553
<i>It felt like he was talking to me,
you know, personally.</i>

622
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:57,703
<i>He talked about
God's forgiveness,</i>

623
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:03,541
eternal life and how this place
we call Planet Earth was only temporary.

624
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:10,254
And how our real home
was in the kingdom of heaven

625
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:15,598
and that I would live there eternally
if I would surrender my life to him.

626
00:44:15,622 --> 00:44:19,206
You know,
I can't quite explain it,

627
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:24,535
but something was happening to me
right then,

628
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:28,081
right there in the theater.

629
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:33,814
He then said whoever would like
to commit their lives to Christ

630
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:37,585
to get up out of our seats
and go to front.

631
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:43,482
<i>And the most important decision you ever make
in your whole life stands before you right now.</i>

632
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,543
So I did.

633
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:56,476
I felt like a whole new person
that very second.

634
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,742
Come unto to me all you
who are weary and burdened

635
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,945
and I will give you rest.

636
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:08,260
Did you find that rest?

637
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:09,852
Yes.

638
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:14,542
Looking back I can't believe
that I was, you know,

639
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:18,797
gonna take my life over some guy
that broke up with me.

640
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:23,912
Melissa, I have so much more in store
for you too

641
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:26,784
if you trust me.

642
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:32,575
There could be time when I ask you
to do things you may not wanna do.

643
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,206
I don't understand.

644
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:38,160
You can't marry Paul.

645
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,231
But I love him.

646
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,549
Well,

647
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:49,357
I shouldn't say you can't,
because you can.

648
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:50,988
But you shouldn't.

649
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:54,318
It's just not my desire for you,
Melissa.

650
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:57,949
But I love him.

651
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:02,781
Melissa, you have
a very tender heart.

652
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,927
How many guys have you fallen
in love with since you were 16?

653
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:10,642
But he loves me too.

654
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:16,565
Melissa, it's just not my will
for a couple to be...

655
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,746
unequally matched.

656
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:23,804
Paul doesn't believe in me.

657
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:29,095
What if we got married and made it
my mission to save him?

658
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:31,866
- I can do that.
- Melissa, do you love him?

659
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:36,341
- Do you really love him?
- Yes, I do.

660
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:40,493
Who do you think loves him more,
you or me?

661
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:45,218
You do, obviously, but...

662
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,620
Melissa,

663
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:53,909
Paul doesn't feel about you
the same way you feel about him.

664
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:58,139
He hates his assignment up
in Winnemucca,

665
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,499
he's lonely.

666
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:02,624
Right now, he thinks that...

667
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,932
you are exactly what he needs,

668
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:08,235
but two years from now,
when you're back in LA,

669
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,697
he's going to want
something more.

670
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:12,939
Something you can't give him.

671
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,971
He's gonna grow to resent you.

672
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:19,303
Do you know what he is gonna
resent most about you?

673
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:22,108
Your faith in me.

674
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:26,409
That still will be the biggest
difference between the two of you.

675
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,805
So, instead of being the instrument
that draws him to me,

676
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:36,732
you'll actually cause him
to turn me the other way.

677
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:38,532
Now, Melissa,

678
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,894
isn't more important that he loves me
than he loves you?

679
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:47,540
Will he come to know you?

680
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:50,538
In time, yes, he will.

681
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:53,569
Well, then maybe then we could...

682
00:47:54,575 --> 00:47:56,532
Melissa,

683
00:47:57,745 --> 00:47:59,509
I promise you.

684
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,138
By then you won't even want
to entertain the possibility.

685
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:10,336
Remember, I have many
wonderful things in store for you.

686
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:15,489
This is beginning to sound like
"deal or no deal".

687
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:17,736
If I were you, I would say
"no deal".

688
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:19,734
You know, Nick,

689
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:24,034
your cynicism is beginning
to wear on all of us.

690
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:27,948
That's awfully presumptuous of you
to speak for everyone.

691
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:30,149
You're starting to get
on my nerves as well.

692
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:33,284
I was against you the minute
you tried to run me over.

693
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:37,489
Wow! I tried to leave, remember?

694
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:40,454
It's not my fault
the car wouldn't start.

695
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:43,013
Nick, you are here
for one reason.

696
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:47,233
Because is not my will
that anyone should perish,

697
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:51,107
but that everyone would turn around
and come to me.

698
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:55,410
The word you remember
from your Bible is repent.

699
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:58,770
I don't have anything
to repent of!

700
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:04,817
As I said, Nick, I'm here honoring
the prayers of your grandmother.

701
00:49:04,845 --> 00:49:07,087
I wish I had known her.

702
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,787
You still have that chance.

703
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:12,662
But only on your terms.
It sounds like blackmail to me.

704
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:17,863
It's not blackmail, Nick. I want you
to be where your grandmother is.

705
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:20,463
The place of everlasting love.

706
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,838
And suppose I don't want that.

707
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:24,866
I'm a gentleman, Nick.

708
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:27,993
I'll never force myself on you
or anyone.

709
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,345
That's the worst kind
of blackmail!

710
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:36,151
Do things my way or face fire
and brimstone forever.

711
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:38,714
Nick, you don't want to follow me,
do you?

712
00:49:38,746 --> 00:49:40,180
Not particularly.

713
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:44,151
- You certainly don't want to obey me.
- Correct again.

714
00:49:44,184 --> 00:49:48,633
Nick, what would be more
unjust and unfair?

715
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,728
For me to steal you
at the moment of your death

716
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:58,414
and force you to live in my presence
and in my will for all eternity?

717
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:01,643
Hell, on the other hand,
is a place, Nick, where...

718
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:06,039
you will be completely free from
all of my "thou shall not's"

719
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:08,292
forever.

720
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:11,786
Hell never sounded
so appealing to me.

721
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:15,488
You know, every day, I get millions
of complaints about this world

722
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:19,669
all the greed and selfishness,
poverty and starvation

723
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:24,145
the wars, the murders,
the abuse of children.

724
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:28,636
I hardly recognize
this place anymore.

725
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:34,533
It bears so little resemblance to
the garden that I created for you.

726
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:38,233
But it's not hell, Nick.

727
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,174
Even now, there's...

728
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:46,107
sunshine on a spring day, there's...

729
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,221
starry night in the desert sky.

730
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:52,754
There's a gentle breeze
on a summer afternoon.

731
00:50:52,786 --> 00:50:56,359
The smell of flowers,
the song of birds.

732
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,645
Not to mention the horrible
storms and floods!

733
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:06,482
There's even people who are willing
to land a helping hand

734
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:08,723
to the helpless,

735
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:11,111
and there's love.

736
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:14,267
Nick, there's still love.

737
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:18,299
How could we forget love?

738
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,276
Nick, there's one thing for sure.

739
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,453
There's no love in hell.

740
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:26,613
There's no beauty.

741
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:28,701
No hope.

742
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,203
There's just...

743
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:33,396
torment.

744
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,680
Kind of torment that...

745
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,444
comes from within.

746
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:45,773
But surely no one would choose that
if they really believed you existed.

747
00:51:45,806 --> 00:51:51,245
Not so. Nobody goes in the hell
blindfolded.

748
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:57,347
In one way or another,
I've revealed myself to everyone.

749
00:51:57,418 --> 00:52:00,195
But if they could just see you.

750
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:03,237
Not even that would be enough.

751
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:09,492
Look at Satan, he stood before me
in the very throne room of God.

752
00:52:09,997 --> 00:52:14,423
He thought that the beauty
and power bestowed was...

753
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:19,596
somehow earned and gave himself
over to pride.

754
00:52:19,874 --> 00:52:24,630
Scratch any sin and just below
the surface and you'll find pride.

755
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:31,185
People steal because they think they deserve
what other people had worked hard for.

756
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:35,360
They hop from bed to bed
because they feel entitled

757
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,529
to just satisfy themselves,

758
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:42,724
no matter who it hurts,
no matter what pain that it costs.

759
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:06,747
Here you go.

760
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:11,082
Can I get you anything else?

761
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:13,530
No, I'm great, thanks.

762
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,324
Enjoy your meals.

763
00:53:42,656 --> 00:53:44,978
This is the best burger
I have ever tasted!

764
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,605
I guess I should take
my coupons back.

765
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:52,987
I have to give you credit, this is
the best salad I've ever tasted.

766
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:57,498
I'll give a bite of my salad if you
let me have a bite of your burger.

767
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,731
This is the first salad
I've ever wanted to taste.

768
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:09,759
Here we go. Sirloin tips smothered
in gravy, on a bed of mashed potatoes

769
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:14,062
with a green salad on the side
and thousand island dressing.

770
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:16,341
Thank you!

771
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,864
- Aren't you going to eat?
- No.

772
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:24,092
My food is to serve my Father.

773
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,740
It tastes just like my mom's.

774
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:36,172
Kayla.

775
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,347
Would you like to join us or
do want me to serve you over there?

776
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:44,125
I promise not to mention
that LA thing again,

777
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:47,007
unless you want
to talk about it.

778
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:51,150
Okay.

779
00:55:17,784 --> 00:55:20,879
- Oh, this is great!
- Is it?

780
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:26,624
It's not too hot
or mild. It's...

781
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,444
Perfect?

782
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,394
Yeah.

783
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,387
Thanks.
I get that a lot.

784
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,260
On second thought,
I'm not hungry.

785
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:08,970
Nick, I guarantee this is
the best deal you will ever get.

786
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:11,347
And it's absolutely free.

787
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,910
You don't have to do anything
but accept it.

788
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:16,843
Thanks, but no thanks.

789
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:20,575
I'm liable to end up brainwashed
like the rest of these people.

790
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:30,720
- You wasted your time.
- No, it was...

791
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,472
not wasted.

792
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:37,564
The meal he rejected
will become food or others.

793
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:41,540
Well, if he doesn't want it,
can I have it?

794
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:43,662
Absolutely.

795
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:48,916
Kayla, I'm willing to give you
many good things.

796
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:51,708
All you have to do is ask me.

797
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:02,250
I have asked!

798
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:05,125
Havel answered?

799
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:09,278
Do you have any idea
how we lived?

800
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:13,709
One week we'd be
at my grandmother's,

801
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:16,977
and then in the next,
we'd be in a shelter,

802
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:20,941
and in the week after,
we we'd be in child services

803
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,163
or a foster home.

804
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:29,877
But then my mom would
get us back, promising us

805
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:32,585
that it'd be better this time.

806
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:36,230
But it never was!

807
00:57:36,256 --> 00:57:38,725
She's a junkie.

808
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,295
Junkies never change.

809
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:45,249
Your mother loves you.

810
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,799
Yeah, when she was
drunk and crying

811
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:50,858
about how she could've been
this or that.

812
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:55,441
She could've been?
What about me?

813
00:57:57,278 --> 00:58:01,181
What chance did I ever have
with a mother like her?

814
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:07,549
Do you think she care if I brushed
my teeth or if I combed my hair?

815
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,578
Or if I was hungry?

816
00:58:09,657 --> 00:58:11,751
Or if I went to school?

817
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:16,279
She'd never let me leave her side
when I was little

818
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:18,824
and cute.

819
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:22,098
She could get
twice the handouts.

820
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,894
When I got just as dirty as her,

821
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:30,390
people looked away.

822
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:36,330
- The way you did.
- I never turned away.

823
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,621
So you were watching

824
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:43,056
when I had to fled out the police officer
after my mother OD'ed?

825
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:47,687
Or how about that time that guy
robbed us and he cut me instead?

826
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:51,348
I'm glad you were watching.

827
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:55,323
I hope we were putting
on a good show for you.

828
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:59,695
I used to pray
when I was little.

829
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:09,956
Pastor Jim, down at the mission,
taught me how.

830
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:11,963
He's a good man.

831
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:13,606
Yeah.

832
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:16,569
At least he cared.

833
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:21,079
What did you do for us?

834
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:25,644
I took all these
hard things, Kayla,

835
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:30,090
and I used them to turn you into
the wonderful young lady that you are.

836
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:33,039
So strong and enduring.

837
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:36,498
Such a wonderful role model
for your little sister.

838
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:41,998
But right now she's with him.

839
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:45,470
- Him?
- My stepfather, Jake.

840
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,631
The funny thing is...

841
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:50,193
at first I thought he was
an answer to prayer.

842
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:52,568
He had a house,

843
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:54,937
and a job.

844
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:59,263
We were finally looking like that we
were going to have a normal home life.

845
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,858
But when he'd got to drinking,

846
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:08,228
my mother and him
got to fighting.

847
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:13,634
It was worse than the streets.

848
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:19,014
And then she looked him
out of the bedroom

849
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:23,811
and he looked for
a new place to sleep.

850
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:27,328
And not just to sleep.

851
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,975
Where were you then?

852
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,052
I was shouting into his mind
and in his conscious to stop and stop.

853
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:42,300
<i>I was there in the bathroom.</i>

854
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:46,926
Oh God.

855
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:49,104
Please.

856
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:52,547
<i>And I heard you.</i>

857
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:02,581
Kayla, your prayer before
you pulled that trigger,

858
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,690
it wasn't for death.

859
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:08,898
It was to go to a better place.

860
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,575
Kayla, if you had
died that night

861
01:01:11,605 --> 01:01:14,495
you wouldn't have gone
to a better place.

862
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:18,943
So the night before,
I caused your stepfather to stumble.

863
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:24,088
<i>That made him reconsider the prospect
of keeping a loaded gun in his pocket.</i>

864
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:30,683
<i>So he removed the clip
and unknowingly saved your life.</i>

865
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:45,546
That was not the first time
I saved your life.

866
01:01:45,573 --> 01:01:47,974
Nor will it be the last either.

867
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:49,567
Kayla,

868
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:53,273
what do you want?

869
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,777
I just want to stop hurting.

870
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:09,148
I can't promise you that all your
problems will disappear overnight.

871
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:13,231
You have a hard road
ahead of you,

872
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:18,593
but I can tell you that you have
a peace and a purpose,

873
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:23,809
that you'll not only survive,
but you'll thrive and grow,

874
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:26,440
if you trust me.

875
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:30,802
Will you follow me?

876
01:02:36,223 --> 01:02:37,794
Yes.

877
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:43,310
Will you forgive
all those people who hurt you?

878
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,749
Even as I forgive you?

879
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,271
Yes.

880
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,599
Even Jake?

881
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:11,461
How can you ask me to do that?
You saw what he did to me.

882
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:13,472
Yeah.

883
01:03:13,827 --> 01:03:15,989
But Kayla,

884
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:19,128
look what he has done to me.

885
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:25,605
I paid a heavy price
for your stepfather's sins.

886
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:29,493
It's the same price
I paid for your sins.

887
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:36,734
Now, Kayla, I want you
to go back to Los Angeles

888
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:41,086
and I want you tell the police
what your stepfather did.

889
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:44,011
I want him to go to jail.

890
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:46,890
He needs to understand
that there is a...

891
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:52,595
price that has to be paid for sin,
even in this fallen world.

892
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:56,639
But, Kayla, I don't want him
to go to hell.

893
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,741
I want him to come to me,

894
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:03,608
so that I can forgive him,
so and give him new life.

895
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:09,155
And you know there's another reason
that I want you to forgive him.

896
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:10,993
If you don't,

897
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:14,830
all the anger and resentment
will just...

898
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:18,633
poison every relationship
you have,

899
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:21,151
even ours.

900
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:26,891
If you want to love,
you have to abandon hate.

901
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:30,735
Don't let anger steal your joy.

902
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:37,733
- I forgive him.
- And I forgive you.

903
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:57,637
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself,

904
01:04:57,665 --> 01:05:02,035
taking advantage of an emotionally
distraught little girl.

905
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:05,437
Nick, why are you fighting me?
What have I done to make you hate me?

906
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:07,486
Hate you?

907
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:13,451
You think I've given you
enough thought to hate you?

908
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,587
I hate Federal regulators.

909
01:05:16,617 --> 01:05:18,631
I hate taxes.

910
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,913
I hate sitting in coach.

911
01:05:23,557 --> 01:05:26,686
You don't warrant hate.

912
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:31,958
You warrant exactly what
I've been giving you all this time.

913
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:34,103
Indifference.

914
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:38,413
I don't want you.
I don't need you.

915
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:42,228
I'm not like these losers.

916
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,325
You don't need
anything else in your life, Nick?

917
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:49,219
I'm living the American dream.

918
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:52,560
Eleven years in the NFL.

919
01:05:52,586 --> 01:05:56,227
Nine Pro Bowls.
Two Super bowl rings.

920
01:05:56,257 --> 01:06:00,410
A sack record that no one
has come close to touching yet.

921
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:06,206
A restaurant chain that I'll take public in a
couple years for hundreds of millions of dollars.

922
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,725
I've got everything I want.

923
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:13,272
What does it profit a man to gain
the whole world and lose his soul?

924
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:17,243
It isn't a love of money that
keeps him away from me, Melissa.

925
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:21,800
- Thank you.
- It's pride.

926
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,728
Here we go with pride again.

927
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,766
Give pride a break.

928
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:32,128
You show me someone without pride
and I'll show you a bum.

929
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,006
Someone who is taking more
from society than what he's giving.

930
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:39,967
So that's what motivates you,
giving?

931
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,813
No, but when I succeed,
other people will do too.

932
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,331
When I sacked a quarterback,
it helped my whole team.

933
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,809
And look at my restaurants.

934
01:06:50,878 --> 01:06:56,192
Each one of them employs
25 to 40 people.

935
01:06:56,216 --> 01:06:58,788
That doesn't include my vendors,
doesn't include corporate,

936
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:01,721
doesn't include my suppliers.

937
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:05,396
Every one of those families is doing better
than mine did when I was growing up.

938
01:07:05,426 --> 01:07:10,239
Funny how it all comes back
to your dad's fruit stand, Nick.

939
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:13,701
Did you not feel loved
as a child?

940
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:18,240
- Of course I felt loved.
- Did you feel secure?

941
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:20,559
I felt secure.

942
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:23,827
Then why do you so much disdain
for your youth, Nick?

943
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:26,233
Why were you so embarrassed?

944
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:30,957
I wasn't embarrassed.

945
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:33,033
Nick.

946
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,492
Nick, I'm going to have
to call you on that one.

947
01:07:36,523 --> 01:07:39,368
As a child, you were happy.

948
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:44,240
Spend all your summers working
with your father in the fruit stand.

949
01:07:44,265 --> 01:07:47,235
Listening to his stories,
marveling at...

950
01:07:47,268 --> 01:07:49,942
the way people came
just to talk to him.

951
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:53,429
Everybody liked your father.

952
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:56,807
You have to admit you got
your work ethic from him, Nick.

953
01:07:56,877 --> 01:07:59,517
I got a lot of things from him.

954
01:07:59,546 --> 01:08:03,301
But not what he wanted you
to have the most.

955
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:08,864
When you were a child,
everybody was pretty much the same.

956
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:12,030
Working class,
lower-middle class.

957
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:16,064
Nobody was rich
or unduly privileged.

958
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:19,442
But when you got in high school,
suddenly were with the sons of...

959
01:08:19,466 --> 01:08:22,675
doctors and lawyers
and businessmen,

960
01:08:22,703 --> 01:08:26,162
people that the rest of the world
thought were very successful.

961
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:30,430
It all comes down to the summer
before your sophomore year.

962
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:34,016
You were working in the fruit stand,
like you always did,

963
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:37,553
when Cliff and Bobby came.

964
01:08:37,584 --> 01:08:43,490
They saw you in your white apron and they
thought it was the funniest thing in the world.

965
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:46,289
And your dad's accent.

966
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:50,672
You used to have
an accent, Nick.

967
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:53,702
You got rid of it, didn't you?

968
01:08:53,734 --> 01:08:57,637
- You think you're so smart.
- But you had football.

969
01:08:57,671 --> 01:09:02,962
Coaches didn't care if you were rich or poor, all
they cared about was your performance on the field.

970
01:09:03,043 --> 01:09:07,151
And you excelled.
Sport was your ticket.

971
01:09:07,181 --> 01:09:09,525
And suddenly you were
no longer the little...

972
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:14,397
Nicky Crocetti in a white apron, the son of
a fruit vendor, you were Crusher Crocetti.

973
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:17,676
God help the man
who would laughed at you.

974
01:09:18,192 --> 01:09:20,844
Do you want to mess with me?

975
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:24,245
Relax, Nick.

976
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:26,684
Have a piece of pie.

977
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:51,820
It's your grandmother's recipe.

978
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:56,002
I'll give her this,
she was a great cook.

979
01:09:56,030 --> 01:10:00,365
That's because she sprinkled
a generous helping of love on...

980
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:02,311
everything.
Didn't she, Nick?

981
01:10:02,336 --> 01:10:06,012
- I don't remember her.
- Memory is a funny thing, Nick.

982
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,728
It can remain perfectly hidden
for years, even decades,

983
01:10:10,811 --> 01:10:15,852
and then come flooding back
because of a picture,

984
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:19,763
or hearing a song,
smelling a scent,

985
01:10:19,787 --> 01:10:22,256
or even a taste.

986
01:10:25,092 --> 01:10:28,017
Grandma, is my pie ready?

987
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,254
Now,

988
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:32,764
what do we say?

989
01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:34,994
Thank you God?

990
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:38,377
- Would you like to pray?
- Okay, grandma.

991
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,169
Attaboy.

992
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:43,040
Dear Jesus,
thank you for this food.

993
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,421
Thank you, Lord, for my family
and thank you for my grandma.

994
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:48,939
In Jesus name, amen.

995
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:56,407
<i>She never graduated from high school.
She was never rich.</i>

996
01:10:56,524 --> 01:11:00,495
<i>She never even learned
to drive a car,</i>

997
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:02,963
<i>but your grandmother, Nick,</i>

998
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:06,946
<i>was a very special lady.</i>

999
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,573
You remember her, don't you?

1000
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,895
Your grandmother had true
faith in my ability to...

1001
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:36,227
intervene and fulfill
my promises.

1002
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:41,575
And I promised her that I would move
heaven and earth to reach you,

1003
01:11:41,602 --> 01:11:43,889
so here I am, Nick.

1004
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:51,299
You put this ancient memory
in my head

1005
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:56,937
and you expect me to throw away
the life I built for myself!

1006
01:11:58,118 --> 01:12:01,896
What kind of weak willed man
do you think I am?

1007
01:12:01,922 --> 01:12:06,269
The kind of man who hasn't opened
himself up to unconditional love

1008
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:09,024
since he was a child.

1009
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:11,341
You put up a wall.

1010
01:12:11,365 --> 01:12:16,577
Your turned your back on the
old-fashioned blue collar values

1011
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:19,346
blasted off into your future.

1012
01:12:19,373 --> 01:12:21,740
But with Sadie...

1013
01:12:23,243 --> 01:12:26,247
there was never a wall
between you and Sadie.

1014
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:30,456
She died before you could
shut down completely.

1015
01:12:30,484 --> 01:12:35,195
And so there's still
just a fragment, Nick,

1016
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:38,977
of unconditional love
that remains in your heart.

1017
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:45,936
Nick, when was the last time that you told
your parents that you loved them?

1018
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:47,969
I took care of them.

1019
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:52,382
I bought them a house.
I bought them cars.

1020
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:54,659
This is ridiculous.

1021
01:12:54,742 --> 01:12:58,952
I'm not gonna sit here and let you make me
feel guilty for something I didn't do.

1022
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:01,585
Nick, some people feel guilty
for things that they did,

1023
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:05,404
and others feel guilty
for what they didn't do.

1024
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:08,338
The question is, what are
you going to do about it?

1025
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:12,468
I don't have to do
anything about it.

1026
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:14,303
Yes, you do, Nick.

1027
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:16,638
This is your time.

1028
01:13:16,664 --> 01:13:20,977
All the seemingly random moments
and incidents of your life,

1029
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:25,507
they all come together to bring you
here and now to this point

1030
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:30,091
of making a decision for your life,
for all eternity.

1031
01:13:30,478 --> 01:13:34,415
Kayla's stepped out of death
and into life.

1032
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:37,987
I want you to join her,
I want you to join your mom and dad.

1033
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:40,419
I want you to join Sadie.

1034
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:44,587
Sadie awaits you in heaven.

1035
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:49,031
Nick, what are you afraid of?

1036
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:52,170
Do you think I'm going to ask you
to give all your money away to the poor

1037
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:55,340
and become a missionary
in Africa?

1038
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:57,770
Or are you more afraid
that I'm going to ask you

1039
01:13:57,805 --> 01:14:02,470
to proclaim my name
to your friends and colleagues?

1040
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:04,671
Is that what it is, Nick?

1041
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,655
You're afraid your business partners
and your former team mates

1042
01:14:09,683 --> 01:14:12,494
will laugh at you
because of this?

1043
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,094
They'll say you're weak. They'll say
you lost your ethic and gone soft?

1044
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:21,118
- Is that it?
- Do you think I care what they think?

1045
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:24,756
You think I care
what anybody thinks?

1046
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:27,309
I'm my own man!

1047
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:30,771
You think you're a self-made man,
but you're not.

1048
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:32,784
I made you, Nick.

1049
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:36,992
You existed in my heart
before the creation of the world.

1050
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:40,583
I have plans for your life.

1051
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:45,484
Think of what you can accomplish
with me in you corner, Nick.

1052
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:48,956
Please, open your heart.

1053
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:52,448
I'm doing just fine on my own.

1054
01:14:54,395 --> 01:14:56,978
Well, well, well.

1055
01:14:57,865 --> 01:15:01,506
You are still in business.
And after all these years

1056
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:05,074
you'd think nobody would be interested
in what you're selling.

1057
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:07,836
I don't sell anything.

1058
01:15:07,908 --> 01:15:12,061
Oh, that's right.
You give it all away.

1059
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:14,047
Any takers?

1060
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:17,904
Not me.
He couldn't get me to bite.

1061
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:20,864
That's a smart man.

1062
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:27,203
I come bearing good news, the road is
finally clear and you're all free to leave.

1063
01:15:27,228 --> 01:15:32,394
Well, hallelujah! That is
the best news I've heard all day.

1064
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,810
It isn't true.
The road isn't clear.

1065
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:38,374
Like you would know?

1066
01:15:38,406 --> 01:15:41,706
This man has been out there.
He obviously knows.

1067
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:43,426
Does he?

1068
01:15:43,511 --> 01:15:45,673
Apparently, I do.

1069
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:48,816
You coming?

1070
01:15:48,849 --> 01:15:50,590
Don't, Nick.

1071
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:52,382
Nick...

1072
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:54,651
I don't think you should go.

1073
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:59,128
- Can I get an escort?
- Absolutely.

1074
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:01,367
Just follow me.

1075
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:03,887
It's you and me, baby.

1076
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,935
That's one for me.

1077
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:14,553
Four set free.

1078
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:23,021
Don't worry, Jesus.

1079
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,212
We'll meet again.

1080
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:49,632
<i>That was his last chance.</i>

1081
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:53,205
If there's a downside
to being God,

1082
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:57,137
it's knowing.

1083
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:02,556
<i>I have reached out to him
with everything I have,</i>

1084
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,538
but I know.

1085
01:17:06,827 --> 01:17:08,807
<i>I just know.</i>

1086
01:17:10,531 --> 01:17:12,625
<i>I am the good shepherd.</i>

1087
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:18,205
<i>The good shepherd who lays down
his life for the sheep.</i>

1088
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:22,870
<i>The thief comes only to steal,
and kill and destroy.</i>

1089
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:28,008
<i>I am the good shepherd,</i>

1090
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:33,003
<i>and I know my own,</i>

1091
01:17:35,255 --> 01:17:38,714
<i>and my own know me.</i>

1092
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:42,509
<i>My sheep hear my voice
and I know them,</i>

1093
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:46,704
<i>and they follow me,</i>

1094
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:50,853
<i>and no one shall snatch them
from my hand.</i>

1095
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:06,088
- Melissa.
- Yes.

1096
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,772
Will you do me a favor?

1097
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:11,324
Drive Kayla back to Los Angeles

1098
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:14,362
and bring her to the child
protective services for me?

1099
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:16,967
Yes, of course.

1100
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:21,378
Kayla, you're gonna have some
hard times ahead of you.

1101
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:23,303
And you have some doubts,

1102
01:18:23,337 --> 01:18:27,763
but this will be ultimately
the first step to saving your family.

1103
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:32,536
- Really?
- Yeah.

1104
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:37,769
You have such a wonderful life
ahead of you.

1105
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:43,629
- Will I ever see you again?
- Yeah, yeah, but not like this.

1106
01:18:43,657 --> 01:18:46,331
I mean, not for
along while, anyway.

1107
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,070
- Can I talk to you?
- All the time.

1108
01:18:50,097 --> 01:18:52,020
I'll be listening.

1109
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:56,537
- Will I hear you?
- Yeah,

1110
01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:00,154
in my word, mostly.
That's the Bible.

1111
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,995
That book has all the wisdom
you need for your life.

1112
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:07,788
And then sometimes,
just in a quiet of your spirit, you'll...

1113
01:19:07,815 --> 01:19:12,651
hear me saying, "This is the way you should
go, this is the way you shouldn't go."

1114
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:20,612
Melissa,
Paul's going to be very upset.

1115
01:19:20,895 --> 01:19:23,876
You'll have to be
very strong, okay?

1116
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:25,956
Okay.

1117
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,235
What about us, Lord?

1118
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:32,225
Hank, I want you
to love your wife.

1119
01:19:32,706 --> 01:19:35,073
I want you to pray for her,

1120
01:19:35,142 --> 01:19:38,237
and pray like
never stop praying.

1121
01:19:38,312 --> 01:19:42,750
Where you have followed
you will now lead.

1122
01:19:42,783 --> 01:19:46,538
Many will be blessed
because of your faith.

1123
01:19:47,755 --> 01:19:50,031
I think I understand.

1124
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:51,776
Catherine,

1125
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:54,546
won't you join us?

1126
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:05,806
I don't mean just here and now,
I mean forever.

1127
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:11,342
If you really were who you said you are,
you'd know I already answered the call.

1128
01:20:11,412 --> 01:20:15,588
Yeah, I remember when you
walked up the aisle.

1129
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:20,020
Catherine, there's a lot more
to do than just walking up an aisle

1130
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,728
or saying a few words.

1131
01:20:22,756 --> 01:20:28,161
You have to really truly repent,
a change of a heart.

1132
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:32,769
If you don't believe me,
believe your handsome husband there.

1133
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,803
He's a good man,

1134
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:37,213
and he loves you very much.

1135
01:20:37,238 --> 01:20:41,232
Of course not as much as I do.

1136
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:43,706
I love you.

1137
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,273
And I love you.

1138
01:20:49,884 --> 01:20:51,750
I love you.

1139
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:57,379
Hank...

1140
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:13,236
Thank you.

1141
01:22:23,711 --> 01:22:25,725
Sorry for the inconvenience, folks.

1142
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:28,791
- Is the road still closed?
- No, sir, the roads are open,

1143
01:22:28,816 --> 01:22:31,217
but there's been
a terrible accident.

1144
01:22:32,186 --> 01:22:33,688
- An accident?
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:39,376
The driver was in a kind of fog and smashed
into the guard-rail around the curve.

1146
01:22:42,096 --> 01:22:44,019
What kind of car was it?

1147
01:22:45,733 --> 01:22:47,235
Was it a BMW?

1148
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:50,170
Yes, sir, as a matter of fact,
it was.

1149
01:22:50,204 --> 01:22:52,491
And the driver, did he make it?

1150
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:56,436
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
He was killed instantly.

1151
01:22:56,510 --> 01:23:00,789
- Did you know him?
- No. Not really.

1152
01:23:00,815 --> 01:23:03,910
We were all having dinner
back together at the diner.

1153
01:23:04,385 --> 01:23:06,923
Which one, the one
in Thompsonville?

1154
01:23:06,954 --> 01:23:10,026
No, the one a couple miles back.

1155
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:13,960
Sorry I contradict you, but there's
no diner a couple miles back.

1156
01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:17,232
No, there was.
We were just there.

1157
01:23:17,264 --> 01:23:21,076
I've been patrolling this county for
more than ten years and I can assure you

1158
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:24,846
- there's no diner on this road.
- But what about Officer DeVille?

1159
01:23:24,872 --> 01:23:26,829
He walked in the diner himself.

1160
01:23:26,907 --> 01:23:28,864
- Office who?
- DeVille.

1161
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:31,310
D-E-V-I-L...

1162
01:23:33,547 --> 01:23:35,106
L-E.

1163
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:41,120
I haven't heard of anybody working
around here named DeVille.

1164
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:44,126
If you folks will excuse me.

1165
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:48,107
I'm not going crazy, right?
There was a diner.

1166
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:53,169
This has been quite a day.

1167
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,601
- Got that right.
- Yeah.

1168
01:23:55,636 --> 01:23:57,275
I guess would be
better get going.

1169
01:23:57,304 --> 01:24:00,229
- Be careful.
- We will be just fine.

1170
01:24:00,307 --> 01:24:03,459
We're in good hands.

1171
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:05,958
Come on.

1172
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:09,000
Please forgive me.

1173
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,893
I'm not a bad person.

1174
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:14,264
- I'm just confused.
- It's okay.

1175
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:16,905
We all get like that sometimes.

1176
01:24:24,598 --> 01:24:25,987
So...

1177
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:30,363
- shall we?
- Yeah. But...

1178
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:32,636
first, let's go back.

1179
01:24:32,706 --> 01:24:36,074
Go back? Where?

1180
01:24:59,033 --> 01:25:02,583
- Are you sure this is it?
- This is it.

1181
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:16,473
That's the cut
for the parking lot.

1182
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:19,443
Over there was the foundation.

1183
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:22,198
No.

1184
01:25:22,223 --> 01:25:25,864
No, this is the wrong place.
It must be further back.

1185
01:25:25,893 --> 01:25:28,112
No, this is right.

1186
01:25:29,597 --> 01:25:31,520
This is it.

1187
01:25:34,068 --> 01:25:39,792
You have to really truly repent,
a change of a heart.

1188
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:47,787
Come unto me all you
who are weary and burdened

1189
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:50,307
and I will give you rest.

1190
01:25:51,785 --> 01:25:53,344
This is it.

1191
01:25:54,689 --> 01:25:57,693
It was true.
It was all true.

1192
01:25:57,725 --> 01:25:59,921
And it really was him.

1193
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:07,827
You knew it was him.
How did you know?

1194
01:26:12,973 --> 01:26:15,101
How could you save my marriage?

1195
01:26:15,176 --> 01:26:17,907
All you have to do is ask me.

1196
01:26:23,317 --> 01:26:25,411
Save my marriage.

1197
01:26:25,753 --> 01:26:29,383
Save my marriage, please,
Lord Jesus.

1198
01:26:29,657 --> 01:26:32,092
Save my marriage.

1199
01:26:34,795 --> 01:26:37,117
I didn't know at first.

1200
01:26:38,332 --> 01:26:41,791
But there was something in my heart
that told me who he was.

1201
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,651
Nothing in my heart told me.

1202
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:50,498
Not until he said he loved me.

1203
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:54,293
I love you.

1204
01:26:55,316 --> 01:26:58,172
Then I felt something.

1205
01:27:00,354 --> 01:27:03,904
We've all sinned and fallen short
of his glory.

1206
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:07,995
But you know it's
all about his grace...

1207
01:27:08,028 --> 01:27:10,463
and sacrifice on the cross.

1208
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:13,018
I don't know what to say.

1209
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:16,960
Just imagine he's right there,
because he is.

1210
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:19,255
Talk to him.

1211
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:22,265
Tell him what you're feeling,
tell him what's in your heart.

1212
01:27:25,145 --> 01:27:29,856
Catherine, won't you join us?

1213
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:34,788
I don't mean just here and now,
I mean forever.

1214
01:28:18,532 --> 01:28:21,502
Good afternoon, sir.
What would be today?

1215
01:28:21,535 --> 01:28:25,267
Menu or special order?
