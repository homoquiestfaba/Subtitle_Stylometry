there's no simpler way
for me to put it.

10
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:07,057
Our children

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

30
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:11,599
In his ten years here,

31
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,057
he's revamped
our education system.

she speaks with you.

Okay, okay. Um...

okay, I'll take care of it.

All right?

00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,265
That Militzok,
she plays favorites, okay?

86
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,099
She wouldn't even let him
take a bathroom break

87
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:32,057
during the test,
and he has a hyperactive bladder.

88
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,766
Chad, honey,
tell him how you...

89
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,891
you know what, I have a note
here from his doctor, okay?

90
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,766
Ms. Schweitzer,
just, just calm down.

91
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,099
- Let's, let's just...
- No one will listen to me.

92
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:41,891
All right, I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

93
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,808
Chad, he is just as gifted
as everyone else in his year.

94
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,474
- Absolutely.
- And...

95
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,224
I'm scared, Dr. Tassone,

96
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:50,641
because if he
doesn't get into OMNI...

97
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,891
and he starts to think
of himself as less than...

98
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,391
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

99
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:57,099
No, I will talk
to Ms. Militzok.

100
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,182
I will straighten
this whole thing out.

101
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,474
- You will?
- Yes.

102
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,849
And, and we'll just set
a make-up test for Chad.

103
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,641
All right, with ample
bathroom time.

104
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,140
Thank you, Dr. Tassone.

105
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,849
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate that.

106
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,307
There's no need to thank me,
all right?

107
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,307
Chad's a smart kid with
the world ahead of him,

108
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,224
and it's our job
to give him the runway.

You know, Chad,
when I was your age,

112
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,808
I didn't even place
into fast track math.

113
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,808
- Really?
- No.

I couldn't nail

I thought my world was ending.

116

But I caught up.
You know what?

117

see those kinds of numbers

175
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,140
in Syosset or Jericho.

176
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,307
Right, but those towns are
a further commute from the city.

177
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,808
Not Manhasset, not Great Neck.

178
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,099
It's the public schools.
The better the school system,

179
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:40,933
the higher the price tag
on the homes, period.

180
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,557
Bob: Our firm has sold
nine separate lots in that area

181
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,099
since the report in
that journal came out.

182
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,766
And, uh,
here's a little something

183
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,224
- you know, from all of us.
- Frank: Okay.

184
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:53,265
Oh, wow.
Really, that's, oh, wow.

185
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,849
- Keep up the good work.
- Well, thanks, everyone.

186
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,307
- Dr. Tassone?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,641
- Do you mind if we get a little...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,140
- Something for my office.
- Great.

189
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,891
- I really appreciate you...
- Scoot in, scoot in, Will.

190
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,849
- ...coming in today.
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,057
Thank you, okay.

192
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:06,265
(shutter snaps)

193
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:07,391
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

194
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,641
- All right?
- Yeah, let's let him...

195
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:09,808
- Let him get back to work.
- Thank you.

196
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,140
- No, I really appreciate it.
- Yeah.

197
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,933
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

198
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,557
Okay.

199
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,974
I can't eat these.
Just, if you put them out

200
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:22,182
for everybody to pick at,
that'd be great.

201
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,307
They were out of the flax seed.

202
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,140
That's okay, that's okay.
Thanks.

203
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,307
(slurps)

204
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,641
How much do you
figure a guy like Bob

205
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,140
makes at his regular job?

206
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,265
- Pam: Bob Spicer, you mean?
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,974
Oh...

208
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,307
high sixes a year, minimum.

209
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:44,224
Maybe seven figures
in this market.

210
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,516
- Why?
- Oh, forget it.

211
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,599
You look tired.

212
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:52,891
(sighs)

213
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,683
You might wanna go home early,
get some rest.

214
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,140
I gotta run Dickens.

215
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:57,891
Maybe I'll try
and bow out and

216
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,724
get a headstart and early
prep for Vegas this weekend.

217
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,599
- I wouldn't bail on book club.
- Why?

218
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,683
Those women adore you,

219
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,557
and each one talks
to two dozen more.

220
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:07,057
The next budget vote's
only nine months away.

221
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,599
- Right, our SkyWalk.
- Yeah, the SkyWalk is big.

222
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,683
Gets us to first.
That's all that matters.

223
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,683
(slurps)

224
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,015
This new diet is kicking my ass.

225
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,224
What is that, even?

226
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,432
It's got charcoal in it
or something like that.

227
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,516
Yeah, coal.

228
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,474
I would kill somebody
for a carb right now.

229
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,891
I don't know
where you could find one.

230
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,974
You are such a bitch.

231
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,391
Oh, would you like a bite?

232
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,974
- I hate pastrami on rye.
- You want a bite.

233
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,599
- I hate pastrami on rye.
- Yeah, I know you hate it.

234
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,432
- Open up.
- (moans)

235
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,516
- Fucking so good.
- Right?

236
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,849
Come on, you can eat more.

237
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,974
You got... come on,
one more bite.

238
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,307
- I will kill you.
- I won't tell anyone.

239
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,432
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

240
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:47,557
(bright orchestral music)

241
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,349
- (laughs)
- You're a growing boy.

242
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:52,099
Come on.
Eat the fuckin' sandwich.

243
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:55,265
♪ ♪

244
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,641
(indistinct chatter)

245
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:07,724
Frank:
Let's get started.

246
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,265
Should we get started,
everyone?

247
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,432
Uh, what do we all think
of "Martin Chuzzlewit"?

248
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:20,182
Okay.
Um...

249
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,265
You know, Frank, the culture
is not for everyone.

250
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,641
Eh, I thought we
wound up having a

251
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,766
really good
discussion, ultimately.

252
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:32,307
Um...

253
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,432
Frank, can I ask you
a personal question?

254
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,307
Sure.

255
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,599
It's just that...

256
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,307
Jonah's...

257
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:46,641
you know, having a really
hard time with the separation.

258
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,391
Yeah.
You know, Ms. Schlacter,

259
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,766
uh, told me that he's opened up
a little bit in Banana Splits?

260
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,391
- Right, yeah, oh, my God.
- Yeah.

261
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,474
- Thank you for getting him in.
- No, of course.

262
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,891
It has been
so hard on us, and...

263
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,766
- Yeah.
- You have been...

264
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,224
such a tremendous help.

265
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:09,766
Oh, Sharon, of course.
Anytime, anytime.

266
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,349
Yeah, and...

267
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,474
Um...

268
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:20,432
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

269
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:21,641
You want what's best
for your son.

270
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,057
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

271
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,265
Uh, no, it makes you strong.
It's, um...

272
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,140
(exhales)
I...

273
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,349
you know, I think
at the end of the day,

274
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,641
her memory is still very fresh.

275
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:38,766
(Pam sighs)

276
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,808
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

277
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,599
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

278
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,474
Jenny screwed up
some paperwork earlier.

279
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:50,891
I'm saving her ass.

280
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,557
Jenny's got a good aunt.

281
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,557
How did Dickens go?

282
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,099
(chuckles)

283
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,974
Well, it was Sharon Katz's
place this week.

284
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,307
And...
(laughs)

285
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,140
- I knew it.
- I, I think maybe

286
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,933
I shouldn't have offered
to wash up.

287
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,849
(chuckles)
That poor woman.

288
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,140
She's nowhere near your type.

289
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,099
She's not, she's not.

290
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,140
(laughter)

291
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:19,099
- Jamieson.
- Uh, Honors English.

292
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:20,933
- Loves Nietzsche.
- Very good.

293
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:22,724
- Yep.
- Uh, DiGennaro?

294
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,766
Oh, DiGennaro.
Uh...

295
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,766
(clears throat)
Social studies,

296
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,766
- ninth grade global hist...
- Ah!

297
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,140
- Oh, American history.
- Uh-huh.

298
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:35,015
Uh, coaches Little League, too.

299
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,307
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

300
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,140
Well, these are too easy.
Oh, here's a toughie.

301
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,557
Uh-huh.

302
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,057
Todhunter.

303
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,724
Oh, shit.

304
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:49,265
Todhunter, Todhunter...

305
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,891
Mr. Todhunter.

306
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:56,057
How's that bowling league
shaping up this season?

307
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,057
Oh, uh, we're ahead.

308
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,099
But we've got our big match
against Jericho on Sunday.

309
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:03,724
Jericho, mm.
I think you'll crush them.

310
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,140
Thank you for putting this on.

311
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,516
- This is so nice.
- Oh, of course. My pleasure.

312
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,766
- Man: Oh, Frank!
- The least I could do.

313
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,057
- Yeah, excuse me.
- Man: Hey, Frank.

314
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,474
- Hey.
- So, um...

315
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,432
hey, are you getting
pumped for Vegas?

316
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,015
'Cause, uh,
I got my bags packed.

317
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,224
- I'm ready to go.
- Yeah.

318
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:17,474
It'll be good to get away
from the wife

319
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,724
for a few days too, huh?

320
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:20,182
- Right?
- Right.

321
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:21,432
(chuckling)

322
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:23,933
- A few days, yeah.
- (clears throat)

323
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:26,224
You want to know how many bids
we got from contractors?

324
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:28,516
Mm-hmm, for
the SkyWalk construction.

325
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,599
You explored several options,
right?

326
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:34,599
- I think we had four or five.
- Okay.

327
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,557
Rachel:
From which firms, exactly?

328
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,140
Hang-hang on a sec.
What's this article

329
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,599
you're supposed to be writing?

330
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,808
Oh, it's a piece
on the SkyWalk.

331
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,516
And the student paper
wanted a deep dive

332
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,099
into construction specs?

333
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,766
They're giving me free reign,
more or less.

334
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,307
I guess I'm just looking
for an interesting way in.

335
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,516
- Oh, okay, Ruth.
- Rachel.

336
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:57,516
Rachel, so let me give you
a great angle for your story.

337
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,057
- Okay.
- You wanna write this down

338
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,557
- or are you...
- I'm taping.

339
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,015
Oh.

340
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:04,015
Okay.

341
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,349
The SkyWalk is a great project.

342
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:10,099
It'll be the first SkyWalk
on all of Long Island,

343
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,557
and yet one more reason
Roslyn schools

344
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,641
put Jericho and Syosset
to shame.

345
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:17,557
And it'll look great

bringing it up, but, um...

524
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:50,307
- Jake's birthday is comin' up.
- Oh!

525
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:53,849
And he's been asking for
the Sony PlayStation.

526
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,391
- Video game system.
- Yeah.

527
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:59,057
And how all his friends have it
and how he feels left out.

528
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,140
- Aw.
- You know, um,

529
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:04,516
money's been tight,
and I was just thinking since

530
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,391
Howard's been doin'
so well and all...

531
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,974
(blender whirring)

532
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:22,099
I'd pay you back
as soon as I'm able.

533
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,808
Just put it on the card.

534
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,724
Pam:
Amber, sweetie, do you mind

535
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,641
giving your cousin Jenny
and me a minute?

536
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,808
Thank you.

537
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,182
But I was wondering if
maybe you could just lend me

538
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,474
the money from
your personal...

539
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,057
Don't worry about it.
It'll all be reconciled

540
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,057
at the end of the month.

541

It's, it's just,

he wants that PlayStation
so much, you know?

544
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,099
Just put the receipt on my desk
first thing Monday morning

545

another thought.

00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,724
over the weekend, too.

694
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,307
See, I wasn't gonna mention
until after the holiday

695
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:25,933
because I bought you something,

696
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,683
and I didn't,
I didn't wanna spoil it.

697
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:31,140
I swear, I swear,
I was gonna reimburse it all.

698
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:32,974
How much?

699
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:35,099
Not much, you know.
Just like, um...

700
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,224
maybe...

701
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:39,766
$1,600 at Lord & Taylor and...

702
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:41,766
another 12 at Macy's.

703
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:51,974
Frank's gonna fix this.

704
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,057
Give me good news, Phil.

705
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
There's no way.
There's, there's no way.

706
00:34:58,224 --> 00:34:59,557
There's check warrants
that are missing.

707
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,182
Purchase orders.
I took her word for it.

708
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,683
She would tell me one thing,
she'd say don't worry about it,

709
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:08,057
and I believed her like the
fucking idiot schmuck I am.

710
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,349
Oh, I never even think
to check up, to validate.

711
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,015
I'm gonna lose my job.
I'm gonna lose our firm.

712
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,641
- We're dead, they'll kill us.
- Hey, hey, no, no, no...

713
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:19,307
Nobody's killing anybody.
Phil, look me in the eye.

714
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:20,974
Look me in the eye.

715
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:26,557
You're running the show here.
Say it after me.

716
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:28,391
"I am running the show."

717
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:33,140
- I am running the show.
- Good.

718
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:35,432
Pull it together.

719
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:37,307
How much did
you find concretely?

720
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:40,307
Uh...

721
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,599
Two hundred twenty-three.

722
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:45,849
Concretely, but that's
just the obvious stuff.

723
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:48,224
- Who knows what else is buried...
- $223,000.

724
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,391
Okay, okay.

725
00:35:54,557 --> 00:35:55,891
(exhales)

726
00:35:56,307 --> 00:35:57,724
That's our number.

727
00:35:58,724 --> 00:35:59,974
- What are you talking about?
- That's the number

728
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,599
we go back
to the board with, 223.

729
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:03,057
No, you're not hearing me.

730
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,474
That might just be
the tip of the iceberg.

731
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:06,099
- Well, you don't know that.
- Frank.

732
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,140
The receipts are gone.

733
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:09,724
They're in the bin
of a shredder, probably.

734
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:11,224
She could have misplaced them.

735
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:12,599
I mean, there's a very
real scenario here

736
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:14,849
where all the other expenses
are legit, right?

737
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:17,474
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Okay, Phil, Phil.

738
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:19,391
She's not some
criminal mastermind.

739
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:20,724
All right, Pam is our friend,

740
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:23,057
and she has made
a stupid mistake.

741
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,307
But what...

742
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:29,808
but what about
the state comptroller?

743
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,349
Hevesi could barge
into this office

744
00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:34,557
at any given moment,
conduct an outside audit.

745
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:37,641
Has he ever done that once
in your 30 years of experience?

746
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:40,808
Exactly.

747
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,391
Just...

748
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,474
give me a number, and...

749
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,557
I'll take care of the board.

750
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,432
(tense percussive music playing)

751
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:55,891
♪ ♪

752
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:16,974
Frank:
Okay, okay, everyone.

753
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,933
So, the, uh...

754
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,265
the sum total is $250,000.

755
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,599
- What?
- Jesus, are you kidding me?

756
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:25,057
(all clamoring)

757
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,974
- That woman has a set of balls on her.
- We can just...

758
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,724
- When I get my chance.
- Bob: You never will.

759
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:30,724
She's gonna be Nassau PD's
for the taking.

760
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:32,391
- And that shitbird son of hers.
- No, no, no, no, no.

761
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,057
- No, no, no, Bob.
- Okay, all right, let's do this right.

762
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
- Put the phone away, Bob.
- And why should he?

763
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,849
Because we will lose everything.

764
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:44,557
What do you mean, Frank?

765
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,182
Once word gets out about Pam,

766
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,641
we're inviting
"The Times," "Newsday,"

767
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,766
and every other paper
in the tri-state area

768
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,265
- to our front door.
- With all due respect,

769
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,683
screw the papers.
This is a very real crime here.

770
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,140
A theft of taxpayer money.

771
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:57,516
Judy, you've served
on the school board

772
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,766
for how long, seven years?

773
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:00,641
- Eight, proudly,
- Okay, and in eight years,

774
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,599
how many times
has our budget been passed

775
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:04,265
by taxpayers without incident?

776
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,641
- Eight.
- Right.

777
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,265
So what happens
when our next budget goes up

778
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,599
for approval in May?

779
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,391
The budget that
we've worked all year on.

780
00:38:10,474 --> 00:38:12,349
The stimulus that
gets us the SkyWalk.

781
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:14,766
That gets us to first.
What happens?

782
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,391
Wendy:
I get what he's saying.

783
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:18,265
I mean, how's it going to look?

784
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:20,808
A school employee
is able to take

785
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:23,099
hundreds of thousands of dollars
from the coffer

786
00:38:23,182 --> 00:38:24,474
without anyone noticing.

787
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:27,265
Why would we pump more money
into the school system?

788
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,891
Right, if a scandal
this seismic breaks,

789
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,432
I mean, our budget
is torpedoed, done.

790
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:32,766
We are right back to square one.

791
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:34,766
I don't know,
you can't pay the teachers.

792
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,265
Maybe they start migrating out.

793
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,557
Whoa, this can't affect
the colleges, huh?

794
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,849
I think we'd have to expect
that admissions

795
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,182
at top-tier schools
would view us

796
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:43,808
under a radically
different lens, yeah.

797
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,516
No, wait, what, what,
why would they ever?

798
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,891
If they smell trouble,
then they...

799
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:50,724
I don't know, they might decide
to lay off Roslyn kids for a while.

800
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:52,307
"Yeses" can become
"nos" overnight.

801
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,432
I've-I've heard of that
happening before.

802
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:56,683
I have.
So anyway, let's just...

803
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:58,891
let's tease this out, okay?

804
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:02,766
We don't perform,
we go down in the rankings.

805
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,557
And then our sister schools nose
us out of the top ten, top hundred.

806
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,391
Syosset and Jericho,
those sons of bitches.

807
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:08,641
Frank: And that's
when we start seeing

808
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,724
property values
adversely affected.

809
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:16,557
(scoffs)

810
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,265
He's right.
Of course he is.

811
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,432
As far as real estate,

812
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
especially Long Island,

813
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,015
a town is only as good as its...

814
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,641
Public school system.

815
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,974
After everything
we've worked for, huh?

816
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,933
Years that it's taken to,
to, to get this far.

817
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,265
These are our kids
we're talking about.

818
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,599
I can think of one other option.

819
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:49,391
(door opens)

820
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,432
Frank.

821
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,015
(clears throat)
Everything's gonna be okay, Pam.

822
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,474
We're, we're gonna get you
home to your family real soon.

823
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,099
We're good, close the door.

824
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:04,099
The board is very aware
of how hard you worked

825
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,182
for the schools,
for Roslyn, for their kids.

826
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:09,015
They know what an asset
you've been, and, um...

827
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:12,182
that is why they see this
for-for what it is.

828
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:13,391
A lapse in judgment.

829
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:15,057
And in light of that,
they're opting

830
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,307
not to press charges
or involve the police.

831
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:19,224
Thank you, thank you.
All of you.

832
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,933
So you'll make full
restitution to the school

833
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:24,307
at the sum of $250,000.

834
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:27,140
250, full...
full restitution, of course.

835
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,391
I'll, I'll make it happen.

836
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:29,641
And then you'll finish out
the work week

837
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,307
and resign quietly.

838
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,099
Wait.

839
00:40:36,182 --> 00:40:37,265
(chuckles)

840
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,349
- What?
- Frank: Okay.

841
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:39,599
Tomorrow morning,
you'll surrender

842
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,599
your administrators license
to the board

843
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:43,599
and you'll sign
an NDA committing...

844
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:46,683
Frank, Frank, I don't... I don't
understand what's happening.

845
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:48,516
I don't understand this.
Why are you...

846
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,307
You stole from the schools, Pam.

847
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:53,599
From, from the taxpayers.

848
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:56,015
From, from the kids
we're supposed to serve.

849
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:58,391
I mean, this...

850
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,391
kind of behavior goes beyond
the bounds of immoral.

851
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:03,307
It, it's, it's cruel, it's...

852
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,391
It's heinous.
It's, it's sociopathic, even.

853
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:08,140
Sociopathic, what?

854
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:09,557
The shameless self-interest.

855
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:12,432
The, the, the
unstable personality.

856
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:15,349
The parade
of rotten marriages, it...

857
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,057
Frank.

858
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:20,724
Look, you need help, Pam.

859
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,891
Real medical help.

860
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:24,808
You're a sick woman.

861
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:26,891
We're concerned
about you, Pam.

862
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,099
(scoffs)

863
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,224
Um...

864
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,182
I am...

865
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:45,015
I'm a sick woman.

866
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,391
I'm...

867
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:50,557
I'm ashamed of my actions.
I'm ashamed of myself. I'm...

868
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:53,349
There's no excuse for it.

869
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:56,349
Well, the sociopathy.

870
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,766
- Yeah, Bob, the...
- Yeah.

871
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:03,557
Okay.

872
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,265
We'll make all the arrangements
first thing tomorrow morning.

873
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,599
Yeah, of course.

874
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,224
Good night, all.

875
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,432
Judy: Well,
that went better than I thought.

876
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:30,974
Bob:
You saved our ass, Frank.

877
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:33,641
- Woman: Oh, God, yeah.
- Thank you.

878
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:34,933
Woman: Yeah.

879
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:42,849
(phone ringing)

880
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,474
PAM (on phone):
What the hell was that?

881
00:43:08,557 --> 00:43:10,432
I... can you hear me?

882
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:12,474
Frank?

883
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:14,516
(Pam stammers)

884
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,224
Okay.

885
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:18,808
I'm just, I'm just trying to...

886
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,599
I'm trying to wrap
my head around this.

887
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,683
(stammers)

888
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:50,849
(phone ringing)

889
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,140
Kyle (on phone):
Hey.

890
00:43:54,224 --> 00:43:55,432
I wasn't sure
you were gonna call.

891
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:56,683
(chuckles)

892
00:43:57,849 --> 00:43:59,349
Kyle:
Is everything okay?

893
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,849
Yeah, sorry, I, um...

894
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,015
just wanted to hear your voice.

895
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,057
- Pam: Where is he?
- Howard: Pam.

896
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,808
- Where is he?
- Howard: Pam, just...

897
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:28,391
- Just sit down for a second.
- Pam: No, I wanna talk to Jimmy.

898
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:29,974
- Where is he?
- Just sit down for a little bit.

899
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:31,391
Is he in this room? No,
he's in his bedroom, isn't he?

900
00:44:31,474 --> 00:44:32,683
- Just...
- Don't touch me.

901
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:34,099
- Don't touch me!
- All right!

902
00:44:37,432 --> 00:44:38,599
Hey, Ma.

903
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,391
Hi, Ma?

904
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,766
Hi, Ma?

905
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:48,015
- Hey, Aunt Pam!
- Get outta my house, Jimmy!

906
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,349
- Pam!
- I don't want you here anymore.

907
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:51,808
- Get the hell out!
- Pam.

908
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:53,432
- I don't wanna see your face anymore.
- Pam, stop it.

909
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:54,849
- Stop it, you don't mean it.
- Hey, what's going on?

910
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,683
You don't mean it.
She doesn't mean it, Jim.

911
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:58,974
- She doesn't mean one word of it.
- Amber: What's going on?

912
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:01,933
Howard:
Your mother lost her job today.

913
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:04,683
Yeah, not my job, Howard.
My career.

914
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:07,724
Amber: I don't get it,
can't you just get a different job

915
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,224
at another school?

916
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:16,724
They're taking my license.

917
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:19,265
Mom, what did you do?

918
00:45:19,557 --> 00:45:21,766
(sighs)

919
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:24,933
I took money from them.

920
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,974
Yeah, I stole.
We all did.

921
00:45:29,474 --> 00:45:31,391
Howard: Okay, look,
just go back to your rooms, please.

922
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:32,557
- Yeah.
- Please let me talk to your mother.

923
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,140
Your car, your clothes.

924
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:35,724
This house,
the other houses.

925
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:39,307
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't want state school.

926
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,599
You wanted private college.

927
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,224
I wanted you
to be happy with me.

928
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:49,349
Pam, Pam, listen.
It's okay.

929
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:52,307
We'll get you a job down
at the dealership, okay?

930
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:55,933
Yeah, yeah, they're looking for
a new girl at the front desk.

931
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,057
- Like a secretary?
- No, no.

932
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,516
Not, not as...
not like a secretary.

933
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,099
You'll find something.
I'm just saying...

934
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,349
- I have degrees.
- I know.

935
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:06,224
I went to school for years
to get degrees.

936
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,557
I drove the bus.
I did the steno pool.

937
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,182
- I did everything I had to.
- Listen to me, Pam.

938
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:13,140
- Listen to me.
- I'm gonna be sick.

939
00:46:13,224 --> 00:46:15,766
You are the smartest woman
I have ever known.

940
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:17,391
We're gonna get through this
and you're gonna

941
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,307
land on your feet, you will.

942
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,349
Come here.

943
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:25,349
- Howard.
- I know.

944
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:27,557
- Howard.
- I know.

945
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:29,432
I know.

946
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:31,307
(bell rings)

947
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:43,015
Rachel:
Hi, Mrs. Gluckin.

948
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:44,849
Uh, I was just wondering.

949
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:46,933
Could I get the key
to the basement again?

950
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:49,474
I just want to look up
a few more things.

951
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,724
What's this for, Rachel?

952
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,307
Rachel: Just for some
stuff I wanted to verify.

953
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:56,099
I can answer your questions.

954
00:46:58,224 --> 00:47:00,349
Uh, okay, well...

955
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,641
I did the math,
and it looks like the SkyWalk

956
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:06,307
is gonna end up costing
around eight million dollars.

957
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,140
- Seven-five, sure.
- Right.

958
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:10,432
It just seems like
a lot of our resources

959
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:12,265
to be spending on cosmetics.

960
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:16,599
Cosmetics?
People love the SkyWalk.

961
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:18,182
"The Beacon" loves the SkyWalk.

962
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:19,974
There was that nice poll
you guys did.

963
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:21,349
Right.

964
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,974
But the ceilings at the
high school are still leaking.

965
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:26,057
I mean, some of the classrooms
had to get shut down.

966
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,140
Sounds like you
should bring that up

967
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,057
with your
student government.

968
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,140
There was also
the pizza oven.

969
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,182
- What?
- I saw a line item

970
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,808
in the expense reports
for a pizza oven.

971
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,766
But then I asked Paula
in the cafeteria

972
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,349
and she said she knew
nothing about it.

973
00:47:42,432 --> 00:47:43,641
Just stop it.

974
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:50,265
I am sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

975
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:52,933
but no one is keeping
anything from you, okay?

976
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:55,683
On the contrary,
we come in here every day

977
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,140
at the crack of dawn
because we care.

978
00:47:58,599 --> 00:47:59,974
We care about providing you

979
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:03,557
with a proper quality education
because we're good people.

980
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,182
Because we want you
to have a good life.

981
00:48:06,265 --> 00:48:07,599
Okay?

982
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:10,808
Okay.

983
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:12,391
Pam: Okay.

984
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,808
The individual purchase orders
are still public record, though.

985
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:23,182
(chuckles)

986
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:26,099
(opens drawer)

987
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:27,516
Pam: Here you go.

988
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,265
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

989
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:33,057
Oh, and Rachel.

990
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,224
You were right about
that pizza oven.

991
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:37,140
It didn't go
to the high school

992
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,432
because we bought it
for the middle school.

993
00:48:39,974 --> 00:48:42,391
Yeah, they have pizza
for days down there.

994
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:43,808
Go get yourself a slice.

995
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:51,224
Frank: Morning.

996
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:52,933
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Rachel.

997
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,182
Dr. Tassone, Pam Gluckin's
in a bit of a state.

998
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:58,849
Yeah, I have a very
busy morning.

999
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:00,683
Just tell her I can't.
Good morning.

1000
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,015
Pam:
Frank, Frank, Frank!

1001
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:05,057
Fra...

1002
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:07,891
(door closes)

1003
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:12,391
I'm sorry, Dr. Tassone's
very busy this morning.

1004
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:13,474
Get out of my way, Mary Ann.

1005
00:49:13,557 --> 00:49:15,140
- Pam, Pam.
- Please.

1006
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:18,015
You know what?
It's fine.

1007
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,182
Everything's fine.

1008
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,891
My exit interview for him.

1009
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:54,599
(knock on door)

1010
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:56,808
- Hey.
- Jenny: Hey, Dr. Tassone.

1011
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:59,140
Uh, Mary Ann said
you wanted to see me?

1012
00:49:59,224 --> 00:50:01,599
Frank: Yes, yes.
Uh, take a seat.

1013
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:03,557
Just close the door
behind you there.

1014
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:11,307
So, I think maybe

1015
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:14,265
it is time that we talked
about your value

1016
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:15,891
in this workplace.

1017
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,140
I, uh...

1018
00:50:21,474 --> 00:50:23,391
- This isn't...
- No, rest assured,

1019
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:25,933
we all want you
to succeed here.

1020
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,599
Which is...
(clears throat)

1021
00:50:28,683 --> 00:50:32,683
Which is why we would like
to transition you

1022
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:35,224
to our special utilities
department.

1023
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,099
Oh.

1024
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,140
Sir, um...

1025
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:43,265
you know, I just thought I was
a really good fit up here.

1026
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:45,849
Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
We're just doing some shuffling

1027
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:48,265
and we could really use
an extra hand down there.

1028
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,891
Okay?

1029
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,432
What about Pam's old job?
You know, I thought maybe, uh,

1030
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:56,516
you know, like a manager,
maybe I could be...

1031
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,140
Maybe I could be right for that.

1032
00:50:58,224 --> 00:50:59,641
Yeah, well, actually,
Philip Metzger's

1033
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,516
gonna be stepping in as
the interim business manager.

1034
00:51:02,974 --> 00:51:04,557
- Phil the auditor?
- Yeah, yeah.

1035
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:07,599
I mean, until we can find a more
permanent replacement for Pam.

1036
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:09,099
But...

1037
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:11,182
we're pretty excited about him.

1038
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,265
I think that I should, uh...

1039
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,307
think, um...

1040
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:28,599
I know what
you all did to Pam.

1041
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:32,516
And I could,
you know, I could...

1042
00:51:33,432 --> 00:51:35,808
maybe tell people.

1043
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:38,391
Frank: Sorry, hold on a
second. I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1044
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:41,391
I just noticed that necklace
you have on.

1045
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,974
How it really
complements your eyes.

1046
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,891
- Thank you.
- It's, uh,

1047
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:48,391
yeah, that's,
that's new, isn't it?

1048
00:51:48,474 --> 00:51:50,849
I don't think I've seen you
wearing it around before.

1049
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:54,766
Yeah, I thought so.
Yeah. I've got...

1050
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:57,099
I got sort of an eye for
these things, I don't know.

1051
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,808
So, um, what do you think?

1052
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,516
Is that... is that a Macy's
purchase or are we talking

1053
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,307
Lord & Taylor collection?

1054
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,766
Special utilities,
you said?

1055
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:14,015
Yeah, I think so.

1056
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,474
Okay, thanks, Jen.

1057
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:23,224
(door opens)

1058
00:52:30,683 --> 00:52:32,015
(chuckles)

1059
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,516
(paper crumples)

1060
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:40,724
Mary Ann, can I get a cup
of that new coffee in here?

1061
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,891
(doorbell rings)

1062
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:50,933
Amber:
Oh, Rocco, you're so annoying.

1063
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:52,015
Get out of the way.

1064
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:54,182
Go.

1065
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,516
- Mom!
- Pam: This is she.

1066
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,099
(woman on phone, indistinct)

1067
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:10,265
No.

1068
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:12,015
Wait, what?

1069
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:15,557
Yeah, thank you.
Please don't call here again.

1070
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:17,015
- Who was that?
- That was a student.

1071
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,766
They want to donate
the fashion show proceeds

1072
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,015
to help pay for
my medical expenses.

1073
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:23,015
- But you're not sick.
- Don't eat that.

1074
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,099
We're returning them.

1075
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:26,599
Pam, what the hell
is going on?

1076
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,307
Bob: Okay, uh...

1077
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,057
first off, we want
to take a moment

1078
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,974
to acknowledge Pamela Gluckin.

1079
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,516
Uh, our hearts go out to her
and her entire family

1080
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,557
and we wish her a safe
and speedy recovery, yeah.

1081
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,182
Okay, all right, now.

1082
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,599
Onto the fun stuff.

1083
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:51,015
Look at these numbers, folks.

1084
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:54,015
These are the best
early decision numbers

1085
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:55,974
that we've ever seen.

1086
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:57,557
Yeah.

1087
00:53:57,641 --> 00:53:59,474

Five.

1109
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:48,391
Hey, Rachel, um,
where's the article

1110
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:50,391
on the
Cancer Benefit Fashion Show?

1111
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,766
I'll get that
to you tomorrow.

1112
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:54,766
But we go to print tomorrow.

1113
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,933
Okay, I'll have it tonight.

1114
00:55:57,766 --> 00:55:59,557
Look, if you wanna be
a part of the paper,

1115
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,391
you gotta be a part
of the paper.

1116
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:03,015
Look, I'm gonna be late.

1117
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,599
Rachel. Rachel!

1118
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:06,224
(binder clatters)

1119
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:08,015
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

1120
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,474
- Sorry, shit.
- Seriously?

1121
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,224
What is this?

1122
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:19,766
It's just a personal project.
None of your business.

1123
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:26,391
Look, I'm sorry
for being a hard-ass.

1124
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:28,808
I know you're going through
a lot at home.

1125
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:30,391
What's that supposed to mean?

1126
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:33,891
You know, just everything
with your dad.

1127
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,099
Yeah, what about him?

1128
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,891
I mean, the parents
talk to each other.

1129
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,641
I know that some shit
happened at work.

1130
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:45,432
You don't know anything.

1131
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,849
Ow.
Fuck, Rachel.

1132
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:51,307
(pop music playing on radio)

1133
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:53,516
(paper rustling)

1134
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:15,849
- (knocking)
- David: Rach?

1135
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:18,516
- Dinner.
- Okay.

1136
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:21,724
What's all this?

1137
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:24,015
Uh, research.

1138
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:26,849
These are invoices
from the school district.

1139
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:36,015
(chuckles)

1140
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:38,349
The school district invoiced
over a million dollars

1141
00:57:38,432 --> 00:57:39,808
in lab equipment?

1142
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,891
And that's just one supplier.

1143
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:44,849
(chuckles)

1144
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:48,349
You thought about
calling this company?

1145
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:54,516
(television playing, indistinct)

1146
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:02,766
Oh, God, I'm gonna
miss my flight.

1147
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:04,974
Not if you stay another day.

1148
00:58:05,224 --> 00:58:06,933
You know I can't do that.

1149
00:58:07,015 --> 00:58:08,391
(groans)

1150
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,849
You could get a job here.

1151
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:15,641
There are schools
in Clark County.

1152
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:17,057
Sure, but good ones?

1153
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,015
Was Roslyn any good
before you?

1154
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:33,307
Hi, is this Champion Products
in Uniondale?

1155
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:35,307
- Man (on phone): Yes, it is.
- Hi, my name is Rachel.

1156
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,974
I was just hoping to ask you
about a series of charges.

1157
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,349
Okay, yes,
yes. Thank you for verifying, Felice.

1158
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:39,641
You've been a huge help.

1159
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,599
- Yeah.
- Thank you, bye-bye.

1160
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,224
That's right.

1161
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:47,432
Yeah, I can hold.

1162
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,599
(phone rings)

1163
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,265
Howard: Bellmore Fine Auto,
this is Howard.

1164
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:03,557
Uh, I'm sorry.
Bellmore Fine Auto?

1165
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:07,641
I had this number listed
as an H. G. Consulting.

1166
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:25,766
Pam: Hi.

1167
00:59:26,974 --> 00:59:28,140
What's the matter?

1168
00:59:28,516 --> 00:59:31,599
Oh, nothing,
I'm just, just tired.

1169
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:33,933
I'll take those invoices.

1170
00:59:43,224 --> 00:59:45,891
David:
Next up is WordPower Tech.

1171
00:59:46,474 --> 00:59:49,599
Now, they billed
the school district $800,000

1172
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:51,724
but no one has any idea
who they are.

1173
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:53,015
And they're consistent.

1174
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,182
They've billed every year
for the past ten.

1175
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:57,849
Yeah, the company's registered
to Thomas Tuggiero

1176
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,391
with an address in Manhattan.

1177
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,891
I tried calling but the number
is disconnected.

1178
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,474
We're gonna leave that one
a question mark for right now

1179
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:08,265
because the next one I've got
is Porto Office Supplies.

1180
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:10,849
Now, I can't find any...

1181
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:13,057
(train rumbling)

1182
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:28,182
(whistle tweets)

1183
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,724
Man:
What, did you forget your key?

1184
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,766
Oh.

1185
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:29,641
Hello.

1186
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,099
Can I help you with something?

1187
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,766
Is this...

1188
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:40,432
Uh, I'm...

1189
01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:41,974
I'm canvassing.

1190
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:44,099
For who?

1191
01:01:48,516 --> 01:01:50,599
Oh, um, it's...

1192
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:52,891
I'm, I have the wrong apartment.

1193
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:54,140
(scoffs)

1194
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,474
(elevator bell dings)

1195
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:36,808
(door closes)

1196
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:41,683
You're back.

1197
01:02:41,766 --> 01:02:44,307
I'm back.
Hey, thanks.

1198
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:48,683
Hey, what's for dinner?

1199
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,724
Salmon.

1200
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:01,641
What's the matter?

1201
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:05,182
Oh, it's just work.
Sorry.

1202
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,891
The salmon's a little dry.

1203
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:11,224
It's great.

1204
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,641
I can tell when you're lying.

1205
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,265
A little dry, maybe.

1206
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:23,140
The couscous, though,
is a small masterpiece.

1207
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:25,057
Oh, well, thank you very much.

1208
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:26,683
(chuckles)

1209
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,391
How was Omaha?

1210
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:35,849
Mm, dull.
Dull as all hell.

1211
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:40,140
So...

1212
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:43,474
So I'm sitting there sandwiched
between Doug and Joe

1213
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:45,766
and there's no A/C
in the conference center

1214
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:47,808
so you can imagine
the smell while they...

1215
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,224
- Oh, God.
- ...talked for hours

1216
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:54,307
about STEM programs
and state aid.

1217
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:55,849
It was, oh, yeah.

1218
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:58,891
- It was, it was a riot.
- Oh, sounds like a nightmare.

1219
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,474
Maybe I'll come along next time.

1220
01:04:03,557 --> 01:04:05,182
(chuckles)

1221
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:07,099
As a buffer.

1222
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:11,891
I would never
subject you to that.

1223
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:18,432
(Tom humming)

1224
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:50,432
(quiet chatter)

1225
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:54,974
Okay, you have documents
to back this up?

1226
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:57,557
Years' worth of supposed
payments to vendors

1227
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:59,891
and confirmation
they were never received.

1228
01:05:00,182 --> 01:05:02,057
Some of these companies,
they don't even exist.

1229
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,766
Well, no, you don't know that.

1230
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,557
I mean, you know
that for sure, right?

1231
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:07,849
WordPower Tech.

1232
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,641
They've billed the district
almost a million dollars

1233
01:05:09,724 --> 01:05:11,307
and no one knows anything.

1234
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:13,057
- Because it isn't anything.
- Okay.

1235
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,766
It is a private apartment
on the upper East Side.

1236
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,849
- Yes, but that doesn't...
- And our superintendent

1237
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:18,974
- has the key.
- ...necessarily mean that it's fake.

1238
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,641
Come on, Nick,
you know what this is.

1239
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:25,224
If he hasn't reported this,
it's fraud.

1240
01:05:25,307 --> 01:05:27,516
He's writing my college
recommendation letter.

1241
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:34,849
Fuck, fuck, god damn it.

1242
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:37,849
What are we even
talking about right now?

1243
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:43,015
Are you sure?
Are you sure, sure, sure

1244
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:44,683
you actually wanna do this?

1245
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:50,307
(quietly reading)

1246
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,474
Frank:
Mind if I join you?

1247
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:29,224
(exhales)

1248
01:06:30,724 --> 01:06:31,974
Don't ever let a doctor find out

1249
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:33,683
you have high
cholesterol, Rachel.

1250
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,891
They'll make you do
the most horrible things.

1251
01:06:40,432 --> 01:06:41,557
So.

1252
01:06:42,557 --> 01:06:43,766
About yesterday.

1253
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:46,015
Yeah, uh...

1254
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:49,224
- That was...
- What were you doing there?

1255
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:52,349
I'm not upset.

1256
01:06:52,432 --> 01:06:55,224
But it is very important
that you be honest.

1257
01:06:57,307 --> 01:07:00,307
I was following up
on the listed address

1258
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,974
for a school contractor.

1259
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:04,766
Why were you doing that?

1260
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:08,349
It's public record.
Anyone could take the time...

1261
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:10,015
I didn't ask you
if it was public record.

1262
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:11,808
I... I just asked you why.

1263
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:17,474
It's for something I'm writing.

1264
01:07:19,766 --> 01:07:21,265
(exhales)

1265
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:27,182
I think you have real potential.

1266
01:07:27,265 --> 01:07:29,265
- Dr. Tassone...
- No, I'm serious.

1267
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,474
I, I read all your bylines.

1268
01:07:31,557 --> 01:07:33,474
You've come such a long way
since past September.

1269
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:35,724
Your confidence,
strength of ability.

1270
01:07:35,933 --> 01:07:37,474
- Thank you.
- No, you have a tremendous

1271
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:39,099
future ahead of you,
Rachel, you do.

1272
01:07:39,182 --> 01:07:40,140
But...

1273
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:43,057
You're still young, too.
Which is why

1274
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,766
you need to know,
and I mean this,

1275
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:47,808
if you go public...

1276
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:50,891
with something you
don't fully understand,

1277
01:07:50,974 --> 01:07:53,683
it'll, it'll come back
on you hard.

1278
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:14,474
I don't know, I...

1279
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,140
I guess it's our fault, mainly.

1280
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:19,891
We try to create
a safe environment

1281
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:21,265
for students to...

1282
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:25,015
challenge, take risks,
make mistakes, grow.

1283
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:28,849
But this mistake,
if you make it,

1284
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:31,140
we will not
be able to protect you.

1285
01:08:31,224 --> 01:08:35,057
Not me, not your teachers.
Because it'll change everything.

1286
01:08:35,641 --> 01:08:37,724
And a lot of innocent people
will get hurt.

1287
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:40,557
Right?

1288
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:42,766
I mean,
these kinds of inquiries

1289
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:45,641
are, are... are like
setting off a grenade.

1290
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:49,140
There's fallout
in the pursuit.

1291
01:08:50,057 --> 01:08:51,265
In the frenzy.

1292
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:53,015
There's collateral damage.

1293
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:55,015
Right... (stammers)

1294
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:56,683
You must know all about that.

1295
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,057
It's not perfect,
but it works.

1296
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:09,015
What we have here works.

1297
01:09:09,974 --> 01:09:11,557
I hope we can
keep it that way.

1298
01:09:13,891 --> 01:09:15,933
(soft music playing)

1299
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:19,099
♪ ♪

1300
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,766
Teacher: All right,
let's get into it. Uh, Rachel.

1301
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,641
Hey, Rachel.

1302
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:51,891
Rachel, are you still with us?

1303
01:09:54,265 --> 01:09:55,641
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1304
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:57,307
- Sorry.
- Teacher: All right.

1305
01:09:57,391 --> 01:09:58,349
Question number four,

1306
01:09:58,432 --> 01:09:59,808
what is the symbol
for potassium?

1307
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:01,182
Anybody?

1308
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:03,432
(music intensifies)

1309
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:11,099
(knocking)

1310
01:10:11,182 --> 01:10:12,265
Yeah.

1311
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:15,099
Hey, Frank.

1312
01:10:16,182 --> 01:10:19,391
I've been doing some more
digging over the past week.

1313
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,474
I'm... concerned...

1314
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:25,057
with what I found.

1315
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:27,265
Okay, come in.

1316
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,516
Look, now we don't
have receipts,

1317
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:35,099
but some of these vendors,
they're...

1318
01:10:38,474 --> 01:10:41,474
this Pam thing isn't
a question of $250,000

1319
01:10:41,557 --> 01:10:42,974
like we'd initially thought.

1320
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,516
Well, okay, uh,

1321
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:48,724
do you have any sense
of what the number might be?

1322
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:51,599
I mean, are we talking 500?

1323
01:10:51,683 --> 01:10:53,391
Are we talking a million?

1324
01:10:53,474 --> 01:10:55,516
I mean, Phil, work with me.
I can't do anything but just...

1325
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,140
I don't know, I don't know.

1326
01:10:58,057 --> 01:11:00,307
You don't... okay, fine.
So...

1327
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:02,557
figure it out, all right?

1328
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:03,974
Work your numbers magic
and then,

1329
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:06,766
let's the two of us deal
with it from there, okay?

1330
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,224
Thanks, Phil.

1331
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,766
Well, there's something else.

1332
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:12,140
Yeah, yeah.

1333
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,307
A flight to London, Heathrow,
over winter break...

1334
01:11:16,391 --> 01:11:17,641
- ...billed to...
- Yeah, that's me.

1335
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:19,224
That flight was for me,
for the Pell Conference.

1336
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:20,599
You knew about the Pell.

1337
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:22,516
First class, Concorde jet.

1338
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:25,140
We, well, yeah.
I mean, look.

1339
01:11:25,224 --> 01:11:28,432
I don't book the flights.
That's always been Jenny's job.

1340
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,307
- But look, even if I had...
- The charge is for two seats.

1341
01:11:32,849 --> 01:11:35,683
Two seats side by side in first.

1342
01:11:36,599 --> 01:11:39,349
It's $5,000
each way per ticket.

1343
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:41,182
It's $20,000.

1344
01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:44,683
Yeah, well, that sounds
like a mistake.

1345
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:47,683
You know,
I called the airline.

1346
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:53,849
Who's Kyle Contreras?

1347
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:00,432
(exhales)

1348
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:03,182
Wow.

1349
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:06,349
(exhales)

1350
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:10,057
Wow.
Okay, okay.

1351
01:12:11,391 --> 01:12:13,057
So that's how
you wanna play it.

1352
01:12:13,724 --> 01:12:14,849
What, no.
I'm not playing...

1353
01:12:14,933 --> 01:12:16,265
Frank:
I mean, the audacity.

1354
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:19,015
Coming from the man
who spent six months

1355
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:22,307
falsifying our records
to mask his own negligence

1356
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:23,933
of fiduciary duty
to the school.

1357
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:26,557
Wait a second, that's not what,
that's not what's going on.

1358
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:27,557
No, no?

1359
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:29,391
Pam didn't
have to happen, right?

1360
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,683
You could have prevented that.
You're the auditor.

1361
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:34,140
The people here
pay you for what?

1362
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:36,933
So you can go off
and do your community theater

1363
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:39,099
instead of taking care of
our school's books?

1364
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:41,265
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1365
01:12:41,933 --> 01:12:43,808
Oh, I can
point fingers too, Phil.

1366
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,099
Right, but I think we both agree

1367
01:12:46,182 --> 01:12:48,265
that that wouldn't be a very
productive use of our time.

1368
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:50,099
- But...
- Phil.

1369
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:52,391
Are you gonna do your job,

1370
01:12:52,474 --> 01:12:54,933
or do I have to call Hevesi
in here himself

1371
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:56,349
to come and do it for you?

1372
01:12:56,432 --> 01:12:58,099
Because I will call him
right now.

1373
01:12:58,182 --> 01:12:59,391
I will deal with it.

1374
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:01,599
I'm sorry that I brought it up.
I shouldn't have.

1375
01:13:01,683 --> 01:13:03,641
Yeah, damn right
you shouldn't have.

1376
01:13:04,683 --> 01:13:06,265
Phil:
You won't hear about it again.

1377
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:08,432
Good.

1378
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:11,724
Get out of here.

1379
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,474
(door opens)

1380
01:13:18,474 --> 01:13:19,516
(door closes)

1381
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:21,808
(television playing, indistinct)

1382
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:40,641
Hey, Dad, can I
ask you something?

1383
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:44,474
And you don't have to answer

No, I wasn't.

a pizza place
on Bell Boulevard.

Two Greek salads

It's for $20.

1453

I'd reimburse the school
out of pocket.

01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:40,974
Do you like race cars, Chad?

1556
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:43,766
Yeah?
Okay.

1557
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:46,641
(exhales)

1558
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:49,432
Let's say you're in a racecar.

1559
01:23:49,516 --> 01:23:51,265
All right, here,
you don't need that.

1560
01:23:54,224 --> 01:23:55,557
You're in a racecar.

1561
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,683
First place at the Indy 500

1562
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:01,599
with, with all the sponsorships
in the world.

1563
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:04,933
The wind is in your hair
and you're feeling just great,

1564
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:07,933
and all of a sudden,
you feel this thing behind you

1565
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:09,015
digging into your fender,

1566
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:10,474
and you look
into the mirror, right.

1567
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:12,516
And there's this hook.
There's a hook in your fender

1568
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:15,224
dug in real good,
and it's connected to a...

1569
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,766
a long metal rope
and at the end of that rope

1570
01:24:17,849 --> 01:24:20,432
is, well, it's a massive
five-ton cinder block.

1571
01:24:20,516 --> 01:24:21,724
Okay, Chad?
All right?

1572
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:24,891
So your job is driving.
You're Dale Earnhardt

1573
01:24:24,974 --> 01:24:27,057
and here's this cinder block,
and all the other cars

1574
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,557
are soaring past you and

1575
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:30,057
you've gone from
first to last place

1576
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,516
and you keep thinking
to yourself, "What the hell

1577
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:33,182
do I have to do to
get this thing off my back?"

1578
01:24:33,265 --> 01:24:34,724
Well, I'll tell you, Chad.
It's real simple.

1579
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:37,557
You just put your foot
on the gas real hard

1580
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:40,057
and you accelerate,
you accelerate so fast

1581
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,057
that rope snaps in two,
the cinder block explodes,

1582
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,391
and just say it with me, Chad.

1583
01:24:44,474 --> 01:24:47,057
Accelerate.
Accelerate. Accelerate.

1584
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,849
- Chad: Accelerate?
- Yes.

1585
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:52,307
- Carol: Okay.
- Yes.

1586
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:55,140
Carol: What, what
is your problem, huh?

1587
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,307
My problem?

1588
01:24:59,432 --> 01:25:00,766
My problem is you.

1589
01:25:01,766 --> 01:25:04,057
Carol, it's, it's,
it's the people who

1590
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:07,224
who trot their poor children out
like racehorses at Belmont.

1591
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,474
- Excuse me?
- Who derive some perverse joy

1592
01:25:09,557 --> 01:25:12,224
out of treating us like
low-level service reps.

1593
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,766
- Carol: Okay...
- I mean, do you remember

1594
01:25:13,849 --> 01:25:16,683
the teachers who sat with you,
who held you by the hand,

1595
01:25:16,766 --> 01:25:18,432
- who taught you to add.
- Carol: No.

1596
01:25:18,516 --> 01:25:20,432
And subtract,
or showed you Gatsby,

1597
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:22,766
Salinger for the first time.
"Mockingbird," even.

1598
01:25:22,849 --> 01:25:24,683
Do, do their names
escape you?

1599
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:25,808
- Are their faces a blur?
- Okay.

1600
01:25:25,891 --> 01:25:27,182
No, you listen to me!

1601
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:30,808
You don't wanna
see us as people

1602
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:33,516
because that is not
convenient for you.

1603
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:36,849
You just
leave us behind at will.

1604
01:25:36,933 --> 01:25:38,557
Never think about us again.

1605
01:25:38,974 --> 01:25:41,808
All right, you might forget,
but we don't.

1606
01:25:42,182 --> 01:25:45,015
We never forget, ever.

1607
01:25:48,432 --> 01:25:49,933
Chad:
What's wrong with him?

1608
01:25:50,015 --> 01:25:51,432
Carol:
You know what, I don't know.

1609
01:25:51,516 --> 01:25:53,599
I don't think anything's wrong.
We're gonna get some food

1610
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:55,140
and we're gonna go home, okay?

1611
01:25:55,224 --> 01:25:56,891
- Chad: Mm-hmm.
- Carol: All right.

1612
01:25:58,182 --> 01:25:59,724
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

1613
01:26:12,057 --> 01:26:14,182
(waves breaking)

1614
01:26:23,057 --> 01:26:25,224
(distant police siren)

1615
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:35,140
Man: Two beach front homes
in Florida and the Hamptons.

1616
01:26:35,224 --> 01:26:39,140
Five Yamaha Jet-Skis.
Luxury cars.

1617
01:26:39,432 --> 01:26:43,766
Vacations to Brazil,
Puerto Rico, Hawaii.

1618
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:49,140
Electronics,
jewelry and artwork.

1619
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,015
- Dog food.
- Is my lawyer here yet?

1620
01:26:52,099 --> 01:26:53,683
You're going away
for a long time, Pam.

1621
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:55,933
And not just you. We've got
enough here to indict the whole family.

1622
01:26:56,015 --> 01:26:59,099
- Don't you talk about them.
- And poor Jim especially.

1623
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:01,391
Just gettin' back
on his feet and all.

1624
01:27:01,974 --> 01:27:03,974
You have any idea what
the job market looks like

1625
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:05,933
these days for ex-cons?

1626
01:27:10,557 --> 01:27:11,974
You know...

1627
01:27:12,057 --> 01:27:14,974
it may not be too late
for you to save them.

1628
01:27:15,974 --> 01:27:17,140
Save your son.

1629
01:27:18,516 --> 01:27:20,641

1630
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:26,891

1631
01:27:26,974 --> 01:27:28,432
What are you doing here?

1632
01:27:29,933 --> 01:27:31,307
I wanted to see you.

1633
01:27:34,974 --> 01:27:36,432
You don't have work?

1634
01:27:37,099 --> 01:27:38,683
I quit.

1635
01:27:39,349 --> 01:27:40,432
(scoffs)

1636
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:43,140
- When?
- Today.

1637
01:27:43,933 --> 01:27:45,015
I just...

1638
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:47,766
just got on a plane
and now I'm here.

1639
01:27:47,849 --> 01:27:50,432
And I...
I'm not leaving again.

- What?
- Okay, if you're careful,

1696
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:47,891
you can make it last a year.

1697
01:31:48,307 --> 01:31:51,224
- What are you talking about?
- What you've got in you

1698

is so special that you
can't ever, ever let anyone

1699

is happening right now?

1711
01:32:16,432 --> 01:32:18,265
- Officer: Hands on the dash now!
- All this time I've been lying to you

1712
01:32:18,349 --> 01:32:19,599
and everyone else.
I'm a liar.

1713
01:32:19,683 --> 01:32:21,516
- Officer: Now!
- Put your hands on the dash now.

1714

do what they say, now.

1715
01:32:23,766 --> 01:32:25,057
- Officer: Get out of the car.
- I'm sorry.

1716
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,182

Leave him alone.

No, you, you can't...

We're domestic partners.

1737

Everybody we spoke to
said Tassone

1742
01:33:50,015 --> 01:33:52,182
did talk about a spouse,
a wife.

1743
01:33:52,265 --> 01:33:53,891
But that she'd been dead
for some time.

1744
