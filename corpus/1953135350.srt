00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:13,992
...aII over the pIace.

7
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,797
AII over the pIace.
Fucking...

8
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:19,965
You know, pumping up 6 feet
in the air from his throat, right?

9
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,139
So how does this

10
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,577
Taking someone eIse's Iife.

11
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,980
How does this make

12
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,819
How do you feeI?

13
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,458
How do you...? How...?

14
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,195

16
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,831
I'm the one's gonna be aIive

17
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,004
Hey, yeah.

18
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,662

00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,337
You feeI OK?

20
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:59,511
You're sitting there Iooking at me Iike

21
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,381
You think I Iike that?

22
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,687
Hey!

23
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,581
I don't Iike it.

24
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,563
You think I Iike that I'm gonna spend
the rest of my Iife in this shit-hoIe?

25
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:17,559
If I'm Iucky enough
not to fry first?

26
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:23,071
The truth is, doc, I am...

27
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,799
...massiveIy fucked.
OK?

28
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,575
And you sitting there with your...

29
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:33,181
Your IittIe fucking
prissy tape recorder

30
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,714
and your questions.

31
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,011
No way you do me not one...

32
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,677
...ounce of fucking good, man.

33
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,190
Am I wrong?

34
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,090
Can you heIp me?

35
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,057
Can you...? You know...

36
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,698
Can you heIp me?

37
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,734
Can you do something?

38
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,736
Like rewire me

39
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,899
so I start doing the right...

40
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:02,601
...fucking thing?

41
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:05,872
No!
I don't think so!

42
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,916
You're worthIess, man.

43
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,612
You got no moves.

44
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,654
What are you gonna do?
Do it.

45
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,555
Go ahead, fix me.
I'm here. I'm here.

46
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,662
Fix me, goddamn it!

47
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,478
Read the Iast part again, honey.

48
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,382
OK.

49
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:46,116
''How and in what way the chiId
sense of his body is converted

50
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:48,347

00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:51,152

''stiII remains to be seen.''

54
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,193
It sounds good, honey.

55
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,333
- What'd you do that for?
- I don't know.

56
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,408
Sometimes I just...
I just hate what I'm doing.

57
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,171
- What do you mean?
- Sometimes it just doesn't seem

58
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,075
to make any sense.

59
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,975
You're upset about the new
case at the prison, right?

60
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,643
Yeah, I am.

61
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,680
I am. This KoIberg, right?

62
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:24,826
He's in for 20 years for cutting
up his high-schooI sweetheart.

63
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,362
Now, Iast week
he kiIIs his ceIImate.

64
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,464
Now, if I can prove
that he can be redeemed,

65
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:33,159
that there's some vestige
of conscience, of sanity,

66
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,496
weII, that makes
this guy eIigibIe to fry.

67
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:37,434
Come on.

68
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:39,267
You don't pass sentence.

69
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,140
That's for the judges,
juries and Iawyers.

70
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:45,246
You have to fight to get
this guy back to his souI...

71
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:48,781
...before anybody worries about
what happens to him in court.

72
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,885
You know what
I'd reaIIy Iike to do?

73
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:55,913
I'd just Iike to cure
one human being.

74
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,491
That's aII. Just one.

75
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,185
I'd Iike to prove once and for aII

76
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:02,956
that you can shake
a shattered mind

77
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,191
and put it aII back together again.

78
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,659
That's what I'd reaIIy Iike to do.

79
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,702
The truth is,
in aII my cIinicaI experience,

80
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,534
I've never reaIIy seen it happen.

81
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,874
Yeah, maybe it's aII buIIshit.

82
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,344
Maybe I'm just a fraud.

83
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:22,111
Oh, honey, come on.

84
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,013
You're not a fraud.

85
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,585
You're the best man I know.

86
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,789
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,291
The best?

88
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:33,928
The best.

89
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,428
Even though I'm not
interested in footbaII?

90
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,670
Even though you're
not interested in footbaII.

91
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,376
OK. Ready for breakfast?

92
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:54,209
- Stop it.
- Samantha. Knock it off.

93
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,949
Come on.

94
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,519
- Ouch.
- Samantha!

95
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,952
Stop it.

96
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,116
Now eat the cereaI.

97
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,455
- Here, BiIIy. Here's your stuff.
- Stop it.

98
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,461
- Want some coffee?
- I'II take it with me.

99
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,795
- I'm gonna knock you out right now.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

100
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,531
- God.
- Hey.

101
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:17,263
Eat the cereaI, come on.

102
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,301
Let's go say goodbye to your father.
Come here.

103
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,977
What time wiII you be home, honey?

104
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,443
- About 6:00.
- OK.

105
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,143
Here.

106
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,616
Come on. Hurry up.
Here, honey.

107
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,251
Here.

108
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,347
Get this.
Say goodbye to your father.

109
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,550
- Bye. We Iove you.
- Love you.

110
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,920
Stop at the grocery, OK?

111
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:43,928
- The grocery?
- Yeah. For garbage bags.

112
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,760
- Garbage bags?
- PIease?

113
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,926
- OK.
- Come on. Kids, Iet's go.

114
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:49,434
Bye.

115
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:06,580
Mary, I'm headed down to the prison
for my fourth session with KoIberg.

116
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,747

119
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,133
''Garbage bags.''

120
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,402
And, oh, you'II be receiving a copy

121
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,271

122
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:32,175
I'd appreciate it if you'd...

123
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,777
I'd appreciate it if you'd...

124
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,850
If you'd send a copy
to aII the members

125
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,550

126

129
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,193
Yes?

130
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:58,589
I'm Dr. Webb.

131
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,634
Your husband's
condition has stabiIized.

132
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,738
Oh, thank God.

133
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,875
It's a miracIe
he survived that accident.

134
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,444
He'II Iive.

135
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,343
But, Mrs. Chrushank,
I'm sorry, we can't save his arm.

136
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,279
Oh, God.

137
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:18,519
- No.
- Now...

138
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,520
...I want you to Iisten
to me very carefuIIy.

139
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,056
I can give him a new arm.

140
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,956
What do you...?
What do you mean? You...

141
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,596
OK, why don't you sit down.

144
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:43,010
You mean, Iike...?
Like a pIastic or...

145
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,311
...prosthetic or something?

146
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,178
We have a donor
who suits your husband,

147
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:54,914
who can give him a normaI human arm
as fuIIy functionaI as the one he's Iost.

148
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:01,722
Now, unfortunateIy, I need to
perform the operation immediateIy.

149
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,263
To maximize
the chance of success,

150
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,765
I need your signature right away.

151
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,166
God. I don't know.

152
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:15,937
CouIdn't we...?

153
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,869
CouIdn't we wait and ask him?

154
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,907
There's no time, I'm afraid.

155
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,641
Every second counts.

169
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,196
Of course.

Can you move it?

174
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,343
It's a process.

175
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,112
We take it one step at a time,

176
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,517
one day at a time.

177
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,018
Try again.

178
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:07,727
Shit.

179
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,166
Good.

180
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,874
Very good.

181
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:45,564
<i>Lab 3-1 3 to the emergency room.</i>
<i>Lab 3-1 3 to the emergency room.</i>

182
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:10,982
You can do it.

183
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,009
- Did you see that?
- I did.

184
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:09,910
You're not supposed
to touch that, you dumbbeII.

185
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:13,248
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on guys, stop it.

186
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,787
Hey, you two.
Remember me?

187
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,285
- You gIad Daddy's coming home?
- Yeah.

188
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:23,630
HeIIo, Karen.

189
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,322
Hi, doctor.

190
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,967
BiIIy.

191
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:31,795
Dr. Webb, I...

192
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,433
I can't find the words
to thank you.

193
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:48,783
- Get in cIoser.
- Mr. Chrushank, how does it feeI

194
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:51,425
- to have someone eIse's arm?
- Come on.

195
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,584
How does your famiIy
feeI about the operation?

196
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,856
Mr. Chrushank, do you think the
operation wiII affect your sex Iife?

197
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:59,694
Mr. Chrushank, can you show us
your arm so we couId get a shot?

198
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,961
- HoId it up to the cameras.
- Let's have a Iook at it.

199
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,469
I reaIIy don't think you peopIe
shouId be taIking to me.

200
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,607
You shouId be pointing
the cameras at Dr. Webb.

201
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,675
She's going to be
a NobeI Prize winner.

202
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,105
CouId we have a comment?

203
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:12,075
- Dr. Webb.
- Question, pIease.

204
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:14,477
We hope that in a few years' time

205
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:18,346
the procedure which BiII Chrushank
underwent wiII become commonpIace.

206
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,647
Other than to pay tribute
to the courage of BiII Chrushank,

207
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,085
there's nothing more to say.

208
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Dr. Webb...

209
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,292
- Move in. Move in. Got that?
- Did you get that?

210
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:30,563
- Dr. Webb!
- HoId on!

211
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,964
You know, guys,

212
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:40,164
Mommy expIained why
I was away in the hospitaI, right?

213
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,810
And she toId you I got hurt and...

214
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:46,073
WeII, they took care
of me in the hospitaI,

215
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:48,181
and I'm aII better now.

216
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,251
And I just want to know
if you have any questions.

217
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,348
No, Dad, no questions.

218
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:55,921
No questions.

219
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,581
No questions?

220
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:02,825
I Iove you guys very much.

221
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,162
And...

222
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,493
WeII, I don't want you
to worry about anything.

223
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:12,966
I'm here now.

224
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,366
And I'm the same
oId daddy I was before.

225
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:20,506
OK, and if you did worry about
anything, you'd teII me, right?

226
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,919
- Can we see the arm, Daddy?
- Oh, honey.

227
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:29,784
Daddy just got home.
Maybe Iater, OK?

228
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,516
- PIease?
- Dope-head.

229
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,456
It's aII right.

230
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:34,890
- Yeah.
- You sure?

231
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,325
Sure.

232
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,729
They gotta see it sooner or Iater,
no time Iike the present.

233
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,808
There it is, guys.

234
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,482
- Mommy.
- Oh, honey, it's OK.

235
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,449
- It's aII right. Come on.
- Dad,

236
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,748
it's sort of gross.

237
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,687
Come on, guys,
I know it Iooks a IittIe funny, but...

238
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,952
It's not how it Iooks,
it's how it works, right?

239
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,929
And it does work
as good as the oId arm.

240
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:12,566
Matter of fact, it works
even better in some ways.

241
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:15,202
- Even better, Pop?
- Even better, BiIIy.

242
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,100
I stiII Iove you, Daddy.

243
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:19,740
I Iove you, baby.

244
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:24,035
BiIIy, I teII you what, why don't we
go out and throw the footbaII around.

245
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,702
- You mean it, Pop?
- Yeah, come on.

246
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,213
Oh, yeah.

247
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,081
- Throw it to me, Daddy.
- Throw it to you?

248
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:35,017
How about if I throw you?

249
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,786
Come on, BiIIy.

250
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,938
I missed you so much.

251
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:10,420
It doesn't bother
you to touch the scars?

252
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,223
I thought it wouId, but...

253
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,422
Keep doing that.

254
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,969
Bye.

255
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,451
What?

256
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:51,716
What are you guys Iaughing at, huh?
Get in there.

257
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:18,311
Now, four months ago,
we were discussing

258
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:21,944
the psychoIogicaI roots
and weIIsprings of human vioIence.

259
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,385
To continue on that, what we
have before us, a paradox, you see.

260
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,825
Because vioIence, when it's
sanctioned by the state,

261
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,464
is acceptabIe to us.

262
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,296
For exampIe,
poIicemen defending our famiIies

263
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:37,131
and soIdiers defending our country.
We ceIebrate them as heroes.

264
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:39,773
But this is not the case

265
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:44,407
with the so-caIIed
freeIance individuaI.

266
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,274
Because we regard
individuaI acts of vioIence

267
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,317
with repugnance and revuIsion.

268
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:56,255
What is it that makes a man,
or a woman for that matter,

269
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,621
who is normaI in most respects...

270
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,699
...Iose controI...

271
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,540
...of the restraints...

272
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:18,743
...that make him...
a civiIized being...

273
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:23,276
...and do severe harm to others?

274
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:30,120
WeII...

275
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,519
...that's a mystery.

276
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,857
And a mystery that you
and I must expIore...

277
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,164
...to its very depths.

278
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,665
Shit!

279
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,599
Son of a bitch!

280
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,533
- Daddy, Daddy, what happened?
- Shit!

281
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:23,108
- What are you Iooking at?!
- BiII, what's the matter?

282
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:25,268
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.

283
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,978
- How's it going, doc?
- AII right.

284
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,147
Heard you've been on the TV.

285
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,048
Heard you were
a reguIar freak of science.

286
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:35,849
- I've been pretty Iucky.
- Is that right?

287
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,049
You don't Iook reaI good.

288
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:39,921
What do you mean?

289
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:41,925
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

290
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:44,055
You Iook...

291
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:47,125
...Iike about how I usuaIIy feeI.

292
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:49,861
Be more specific.
What do you mean?

293
00:29:50,938 --> 00:29:54,465
You Iook Iike shit, man.
Do you speak EngIish?

294
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,936
Maybe you got some kind of...

295
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,807
...IittIe demon inside
of you these days.

296
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,281
How about that, doc?

297
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:06,579
You been Iosing sIeep IateIy?

298
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,550
Let me ask you, does it
make it easier for you to taIk to me,

299
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,457
seeing me Iike this?

300
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,664
Do you trust me?

301
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,699
Yeah.

302
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:25,738
I don't know.

303
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,975
I want you to trust me.

304
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,063
They onIy give those
out on death row, paI.

305
00:30:57,238 --> 00:31:00,002
You gotta be a stone
kiIIer to wear that shit.

306
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,574
What kind of shrink are you, man?

307
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,811
You get away from me!
Get away from me!

308
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,538
Get away,
I'm not taIking to you, man.

309
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:10,980
You got that fucking thing
on your arm. Get away! Get away!

310
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,517
Get away from me!

311
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,052
Two weeks and
they haven't found the guy?

312
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,053
- I toId the cops, back off.
- Excuse me.

313
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,486
- Come on!
- You're hurting my arm.

314
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:18,920
Don't give me any grief.

315
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:20,890
- Is there a warrant?
- Judge signed it.

316
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:23,530
Get down to Forensics
and check it out.

317
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,169
Hey, BiII.
What can I do you for?

318
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:35,934
I want you to run my prints.

319
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,169
- You want me to run your prints?
- Yeah.

320
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:40,814
Any past record I had wouId
show up on the printout, right?

321
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,314
Sure. Why, you got some
bIackouts you're worried about?

322
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,475
No. Just induIge me, wiII you?

323
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:48,815
Give me your thumb.

324
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:53,845
Jesus Christ.

325
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,437
Honey...

326
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,141
...what's the matter?

327
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,940
How Iong you been
sitting here Iike this, hon?

328
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,248
I don't know.

329
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,847
Why can't you sIeep, honey?

330
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,912
I don't know.

331
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,981
BiII, come on. TaIk to me.

332
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:14,062
I think there's something
the matter with me.

333
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,302
What?

334
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:21,470
It's the arm.

335
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:25,436
The arm's OK.

336
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:29,377
No, I think there's something
wrong with it.

337
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,575
What are you taIking about?

338
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,381
I found out who it beIonged to.

339
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:39,185
You did? Who?

340
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,654
A vicious kiIIer.

341
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,803
Somebody who makes KoIberg
Iook Iike a...

342
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,200
Like an aItar boy.

343
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,309
Honey...

344
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:01,411
...you have this guy's arm.
You don't have his personaIity.

345
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:06,449
I don't know.

346
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,046
You know nothing
about this guy, right?

347
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,158
Except his rap sheet?

348
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:16,256
You aIways say when you're
confused, get more information.

349
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,160
Find out who the guy reaIIy was.

350
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:23,064
The differences between you
and this creep wiII emerge.

351
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:24,803
I chose not to teII you
about FIetcher,

352
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:27,566
because I thought it wouId
impede your recovery.

353
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,869
In the Iong run, scientificaIIy speaking,

354
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,672
the psychoIogicaI makeup
of the donor is irreIevant.

355
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,742
It's your arm now,
not CharIey FIetcher's.

356
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:46,824
Yeah. WeII...

357
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:48,718
...that's what my wife says.

358
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,889
You shouId make a practice of
Iistening to her more cIoseIy.

359
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:56,531
Dr. Webb...

360
00:35:57,138 --> 00:36:00,471
...you put a kiIIer's arm onto my body,
and you didn't teII me.

361
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:04,133
I now have a murderer's bIood
in my bIood.

362
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:07,542
I can't beIieve a man with your
psychiatric background

363
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:10,809
can be saying what you're saying.

364
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:15,021
That arm can't do anything
you don't want it to.

365
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,692
- How do you know that?
- Listen, BiII.

366
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,930
Any physicaI probIems you have
with the arm,

367
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,727
I and my staff wiII be thriIIed
to heIp you with.

368
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:31,261
But as to these other matters
you're bringing up...

369
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,270
WeII...

370
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,205
...I suggest you taIk
to a good psychiatrist.

371
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:44,246
Thanks for your time, doctor.

372
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:54,618
Dr. Webb.

373
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,956
Mr. Draper is having some probIems.

374
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,895
I'II take a Iook at him right away.

375
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,819
Damn it, who is that?

376
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,025
What do you want?

377
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,496
I need to taIk to you.

378
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,229
You need to taIk to me?

379
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:21,931
What about?

380
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,541
About your arm.

381
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,614
My arm?

382
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,715
Yeah, I got the other one.

383
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,278
Yeah...

384
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,114
...so Iike...

385
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,121
...you want to arm-wrestIe,
or what?

386
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,354
That arm used to beIong to a kiIIer.

387
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:50,167
OK.

388
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,601
You got my attention.

389
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,802
This is it, oId man.

390
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:03,411
Magic digit saved my Iife.

391
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,275
Death,

392
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,818
transfiguration.

393
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,419
CompIete rebirth.

394
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:16,196
Best work I have ever done.

395
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:20,424
Best work anyone's ever done.
In this century anyhow.

396
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,159
You're a true beIiever
in Dr. Webb, huh?

397
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:29,771
Agatha Webb is the most
briIIiant woman I have ever met.

398
00:40:29,943 --> 00:40:32,411
ProbabIy on a genius IeveI.

399
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,672
Darwin...

400
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:36,907
...Edward Hopper...

401
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:40,876
...WiIheIm Reich, EIvis PresIey
and Agatha Webb.

402
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:42,989
I put her right up there.

403
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,354
This is CharIey FIetcher.

404
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,662
CharIey who?

405
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,198
CharIey FIetcher, the kiIIer.

406
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,760
KiIIed 20 peopIe.

407
00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:59,363
With his bare hands.
With that hand that you paint with.

408
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,304
The arm that Webb sewed
onto your shouIder, that...

409
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:03,966
That kiIIed peopIe.

410
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:05,702
Yeah?

411
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:08,404
WeII, what did he do with your arm?

412
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:12,551
Don't you wonder
where these images come from?

413
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,688
If maybe they come from him?

414
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:18,355
Oh, Iook, paI,
I don't know what you do,

415
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:21,653
but you sure the heII ain't no art critic.

416
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,593
Where do my images come from?

417
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,226
If you or anybody have
a sound theory on that one,

418
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,494
I recommend you
bottIe it and seII it at auction.

419
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,900
They just come to me, man.

420
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,233
I snatch them out of the air.

421
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:36,806
Thank God.

422
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:43,583
I want to show you something.

423
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:51,181
You see this?

424
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:58,130
For the Iast...25 years...

425
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:01,896
...I was a hack. I can say that now.

426
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,003
Dumb...

427
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,502
...Cape Cod Iandscapes.

428
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:13,242
WaII fiIIers for banks, hoteI rooms,
that was the best I couId do.

429
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:16,712
Nobody had two seconds
of their precious fucking time

430
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:18,351
for my serious work.

431
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,283
I get this arm, and, hey,

432
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:27,883
I make $250,000
in the first three weeks.

433
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:30,291
My deaIer's phone
never stops ringing.

434
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:36,198
<i>The New York</i>-fucking-<i>Times</i> is taIking
about my ''searing, originaI taIent''.

435
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,995
I got no compIaints.

436
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,134
The worId is my fucking oyster.

437
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,245
I'm a 1 0-year-oId kid on the street
corner fIying a red, white and bIue kite.

438
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:48,472
You hear what I'm saying?

439
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:54,476
This isn't art. This...
These, these...

440
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,146
These aren't your pictures.
This is...

441
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,384
These are CharIey FIetcher's pictures.
Don't you see? That's what he saw.

442
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:02,620
This, this right here?
This is what he saw

443
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,320
when he was breaking a girI's neck.

444
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,331
That over there, that's what he saw
when he kiIIed five poIice officers.

445
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,560
And this one right here?
This is what he saw

446
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:11,465
when he was Iaying
on the operating tabIe,

447
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:13,196
and they were cutting him to pieces!

448
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:15,568
These are his pictures!
I know what I'm taIking about

449
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:18,472
because I see these pictures
in my mind!

450
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:21,848
You see those pictures in your mind?

451
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:24,914
Yeah?

452
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:28,777
You see this?

453
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:31,083
It's a paintbrush.

454
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,351
You see this?

455
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,789
This is paint.

456
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:37,362
Go ahead. Have at it!

457
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:40,022
Everybody's a fucking painter.

458
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,569
I'm sorry that you got a probIem
with aII this, but, hey.

459
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:48,299
I'm busy.
The inspiration is on the fIow.

460
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:52,377
The bIuebird is on the wing,
and I gotta catch it.

461
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,811
I gotta, see?
I'm working on my first miIIion here.

462
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,381
Nice taIking to you.

463
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:03,647
<i>lt's childish of me, l know.</i>

464
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:07,850
<i>But l'm somewhat disturbed to learn</i>
<i>that l'm not the only beneficiary</i>

465
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,496
<i>of Dr. Webb's experiments.</i>

466
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:14,625
<i>l must find out if other</i>
<i>experimental subjects are...</i>

467
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:17,292
<i>...having the same</i>
<i>turbulent shifts in mood</i>

468
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:20,668
<i>and activity</i>
<i>that l've been experiencing.</i>

469
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:24,072
<i>Does the arm really have a soul</i>
<i>of its own?</i>

470
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:26,569
<i>These questions are...</i>

471
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,944
<i>...l know, monstrous and fantastic.</i>

472
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:33,050
<i>But what has happened</i>
<i>since the accident...</i>

473
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:35,345
<i>ls it not fantastic?</i>

474
00:44:35,522 --> 00:44:37,217
- Honey, we're Iate.
- Jesus Christ. What?

475
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,983
You scared the shit out of me.
What?

476
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,557
WeII, piss off. I'm not the one who said
we had to go

477
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:45,494
to this facuIty dinner party for the new
German guy in your department.

478
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,156
Oh, shit. I forgot aII about it.

479
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:49,495
If you think Iistening to a bunch
of facuIty cIowns gossip

480
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,230
is my idea of a good time,
you've got another thing coming.

481
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,931
If you don't want to Ieave
your bIessed study, Iet's not go.

482
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:56,370
Hey, hey, hoId on a second!

483
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,943
- What are you so angry about?
- What am I so angry about?

484
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:01,239
I don't know. What have I got
to be so angry about?

485
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:04,009
Last night you scare the shit out of
me about the guy who had your arm.

486
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:06,175
Today you bury yourseIf in here
with your books.

487
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:08,480
What have I got to be
angry about, huh?

488
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:13,357
OK. I'm sorry. AII right?

489
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:16,325
I'm sorry. There's nothing wrong.
I'm sorry. Everything's fine.

490
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:18,259
I taIked to Dr. Webb,
everything's perfect.

491
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:19,956
You saw Dr. Webb
and you didn't teII me?

492
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,567
Why shouId I? There's nothing
wrong. Everything's fine.

493
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:24,135
I got this guy FIetcher's arm.

494
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,068
It's no big deaI. Who cares?
Everything's perfect.

495
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:32,102
- So it's OK?
- Yeah, it's OK. It's great!

496
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,963
He took five of my men.
Good ones.

497
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,258
I took him in.

498
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,799
The judge gave him the chair.

499
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,066
Then it kind of gets...

500
00:45:58,238 --> 00:45:59,967
...hazy.

501
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,374
There's this Iady doctor
who wants to experiment

502
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,171
grafting techniques on convicts.

503
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:09,305
She's up to her neck in poIitics.

504
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:10,950
CharIey's got no famiIy.

505
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:13,643
No Iawyer. No money.
He's nobody.

506
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,216
She puIIs the right strings...

507
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,517
...and cha-cha-cha...

508
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,319
...you've got his arm.

509
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:25,823
I was in the operation room

510
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:30,163
with eight armed officers
when they sawed his head off.

511
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:31,861
End of story.

512
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:36,132
I'm home.

513
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:41,406
Hey! Where is everybody?

514
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:43,139
Hey!

515
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:45,409
- Dad!
- Hey!

516
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,481
Come here, you.

517
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:02,932
Damn it!

518
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:05,733
- BiIIy!
- Mom!

519
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,999
What's going on?
BiIIy, what is it?

520
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:11,770
What is wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

521
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:14,441
- I'm sorry.
- He's a chiId. You don't...

522
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:18,277
You don't hit a chiId!
Don't you ever put your hands on him!

523
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,279
Come here.

524
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,815
Mommy, what's wrong with Daddy?

525
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:33,164
<i>That arm can't do anything</i>
<i>you don't want it to.</i>

526
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:37,429
Go, go, go.

527
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,629
Go for a shot. Put it up.
Nice shot.

528
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:43,737
Hey, Mark!

529
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:48,238
- Pump it up, Mark.
- Yo, Mark, what's up?

530
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:50,880
Hey, guys.

531
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,678
- Hey, Mark, how you doing?
- Good.

532
00:47:52,853 --> 00:47:55,481
- You positive you're up for this?
- I'm positive. Let's do it.

533
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:58,123
- OK. You're on my side.
- Hey, Mark, throw it here.

534
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:02,425
AII right, Iet's go. PIay it tight, now.
PIay it tight.

535
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:04,564
Come on, Iet's go.

536
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:06,631
- Bring it down.
- Man-to-man.

537
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:10,703
Watch that hoIe. Watch the zone!

538
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:13,339
- Watch the pick there!
- Get on him.

539
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,506
Go from the side. Go for it.

540
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,946
Let me have it.

541
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:22,411
Look around.
Harris, go for the boards, now.

542
00:48:22,582 --> 00:48:24,914
- Hey, over here.
- Come on, Casey. Come on, now.

543
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,617
- Get at him.
- AII right. Go for it, Mark.

544
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:30,779
HoIy shit!

545
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:37,053
Yeah!

546
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:37,950
Jesus Christ!

547
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:47,627
What the fuck?

548
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,697
Oh...

549
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:55,601
You aII right?

550
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,873
- Huh?
- Yeah, I... I think so.

551
00:49:58,044 --> 00:49:59,409
What happened?

552
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,274
I...

553
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,383
I don't know what happened.

554
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:07,516
Just, my Ieg...

555
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:09,552
- Fuck.
- Your Ieg?

556
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:11,554
What's the matter with your Ieg?

557
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:15,320
I don't know, it just kind of...
Just kind of stomped on the gas there.

558
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:18,953
And I couIdn't...
I couIdn't get it to hit the fucking brake.

559
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:21,534
- It sounds pretty nuts, huh?
- No, it doesn't.

560
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:23,532
Doesn't sound nuts at aII.

561
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:26,005
My name's BiII Chrushank.

562
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:27,434
Hi.

563
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,302
I know this sounds weird
but I got my arm

564
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:31,842
from the same pIace
you got your Iegs.

565
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:35,913
- I'm Mark. Mark Draper.
- Hi, Mark.

566
00:50:36,082 --> 00:50:37,379
Hi.

567
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:40,119
Mark, you aII right?

568
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,549
OK.

569
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:43,985
Can I taIk to you a IittIe bit?

570
00:50:44,157 --> 00:50:45,488
Yeah.

571
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:47,058
Sure.

572
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:48,592
Listen, I, I...

573
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,253
See, I've been having
some side effects from...

574
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:54,525
From this operation, and I just... I need
to taIk to somebody who's been

575
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:57,864
through the same procedure,
you know what I mean? And...

576
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:01,530
WeII, my arm, it's kind of Iike...
It's been doing things on its own.

577
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:03,205
And, and something's wrong.

578
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:06,834
See, something's wrong with this
operation. I don't know what it is.

579
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:08,571
It's...

580
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:11,182
...probabIy just rehabiIitation,
you know? I mean,

581
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:13,945
it takes a whiIe for it to come back.
I think that's what happened.

582
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,111
I just was having troubIe
with my coordination.

583
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:18,985
Coordination? Mark.
Mark, I foIIowed you.

584
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,717
I, I saw you pIay basketbaII.

585
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:22,953
You Iooked pretty coordinated
on the court there.

586
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:26,098
What's the matter with the car here,
that's not coordination.

587
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:29,801
Hey, it was an accident, you know.

588
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:32,164
I mean, accidents happen.

589
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,101
Hey, Iook, I can waIk.

590
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:39,307
I had an accident three years
ago at work.

591
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:42,880
It crushed both my Iegs.
Put me in a fucking wheeIchair.

592
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:45,376
Lose your Iegs sometime,
I'm teIIing you,

593
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:48,248
aII your other probIems
shrink to nothing in comparison.

594
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:50,321
Jesus Christ. Why...?

595
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,391
Why doesn't anybody want to ask any
questions about these operations?

596
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,585
What are you taIking about,
ask questions? I mean...

597
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,062
Look, aII I want to do is get good with
these babies and get on with my Iife.

598
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:03,869
I suggest you do the same.

599
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,298
Yeah, aII right. AII right, Mark.
Yeah. OK.

600
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:09,442
Listen, I'II teII you what.

601
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,702
Here's my card, aII right?

602
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:14,811
Here. I'm sorry I bothered you.
If you...

603
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:19,418
No bother, it's just, you know...
I have to get on with it.

604
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,076
- Yeah.
- AII right.

605
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:23,586
Thanks for... Thanks for stopping.

606
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:27,552
BiII.

607
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,518
BiII. BiII.

608
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:36,160
Stop it.

609
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,435
Karen.

610
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:47,334
Get away from me!

611
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:52,736
Just stay away from me!

612
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,111
Stay away from me.

613
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,085
Wake up, honey.

614
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:07,521
Daddy, I'm asIeep.

615
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,602
Sit down here.

616
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:28,576
BiIIy. BiIIy.

617
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:34,679
Dad.

618
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,549
I was asIeep.

619
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:40,249
What's the matter?
Where's Mommy?

620
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:46,923
Daddy has to go away
for a IittIe whiIe, guys. OK?

621
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:49,696
How Iong?

622
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:52,204
I don't know, BiIIy.

623
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:58,470
Daddy Ioves you guys...

624
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:00,510
...very, very much.

625
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,381
Why? Are you sad with Mommy?

626
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,143
No, honey.

627
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,044
Can I come?

628
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:13,988
No, BiIIy, you can't.

629
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:56,931
I want it off.

630
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,833
- Are you insane?
- I got serious probIems, doctor.

631
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:03,707
I hit my kid.
I tried to strangIe my wife.

632
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:06,367
I have nightmares every night!

633
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:08,305
Look, it's...it's OK, aII right?

634
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,642
The arm's fine. I don't want it.
Give it to somebody eIse.

635
00:56:10,817 --> 00:56:12,478
Just give me a hook or something.

636
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:15,382
Do you reaIize what I
and my team have accompIished

637
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:17,785
with that arm of yours?

638
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:21,356
Don't you reaIize that if a gun were put
to my head, I wouIdn't jeopardize

639
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:23,722
the accompIishment
that your surgery represents?

640
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:26,421
Can't you see this arm is kiIIing me?!

641
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,499
I'm sorry to put this so bIuntIy, BiII.

642
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:31,432
But the pain you're in
just isn't that important

643
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:34,971
when I baIance it against
the significance of the experiment.

644
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,582
You won't perform the operation
to remove the arm?

645
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:46,309
No.

646
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,217
And I'II see you put
in a mentaI institution

647
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,449
before I Iet you undo
what I've done.

648
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:57,828
Let me be bIunt, doctor.

649
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:01,089
Why don't you go fuck yourseIf.

650
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,267
Get the heII out of this office.

651
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:06,337
Fuck you and aII your buIIshit!

652
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,599
I want this fucking arm off!

653
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,210
<i>l don't know how</i>
<i>we got to be like this.</i>

654
00:57:21,587 --> 00:57:24,954
<i>lt all seemed to go so well at first,</i>
<i>and now...</i>

655
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:32,988
<i>Now we can't seem to have a</i>
<i>normal moment with you around here.</i>

656
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,425
<i>lf only l hadn't signed</i>
<i>that damn piece of paper,</i>

657
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:38,433
<i>none of this would be happening.</i>

658
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:49,476
<i>The corollary of violence</i>
<i>is loneliness.</i>

659
00:57:49,649 --> 00:57:54,382
<i>Humanity shrinks from the violent man</i>
<i>as if he were a carrier of disease.</i>

660
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:58,780
<i>Cut off from my family,</i>
<i>l'm terrified of what l am becoming.</i>

661
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:02,186
<i>l need someone</i>
<i>to share my sense of isolation with.</i>

662
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:06,563
<i>And yes, a growing sense of horror.</i>

663
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:08,563
<i>l'm alone...</i>

664
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,600
<i>...and afraid.</i>

665
00:58:23,783 --> 00:58:26,308
I reaIIy appreciate
you guys showing up.

666
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:31,048
Every time I Iook at my hand...

667
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:34,688
...I keep thinking...

668
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,655
...about how many peopIe it's kiIIed.

669
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:44,196
How can one man
kiII so many peopIe?

670
00:58:48,741 --> 00:58:51,608
I'm having terribIe nightmares,
you guys.

671
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:53,378
Look...

672
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:56,538
...I've had some probIems
with the Iegs too, but I mean...

673
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:59,048
...just as soon keep them, right?

674
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:03,286
It's just pieces of this guy we've got.
Not his...

675
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,651
Not him, you know.

676
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:08,683
That's what I'm wondering, see?

677
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,264
I mean, where is eviI...?

678
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:14,228
Where does it Iive?

679
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:18,462
Does it Iive in the souI?

680
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:23,805
In the mind?
Maybe it Iives in the heart.

681
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:28,907
Maybe it Iives in the fIesh.

682
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:34,008
How can one man kiII
so many peopIe?

683
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:36,246
Look, BiII.

684
00:59:36,722 --> 00:59:40,556
You gotta stop torturing yourseIf.
Lay off the metaphysicaI specuIation.

685
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:44,218
It's a waste of fucking time,
you know what I'm saying?

686
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,926
Maybe eviI Iives in the skin.

687
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:55,406
I don't know.

688
00:59:55,575 --> 01:00:00,308
Look, why don't you taIk
to Agatha Webb about this.

689
01:00:00,479 --> 01:00:04,472
She knows what she's taIking about.
I mean, she's Iooked into these things.

690
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:09,349
She's spent her whoIe Iife on it.
She's gone to the mountain, man.

691
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,849
How come you guys don't have
the same symptoms I do, huh?

692
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:20,693
I mean, why wasn't my transpIant
a success Iike yours?

693
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,331
I mean...

694
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:26,799
She might be briIIiant.
You might be right.

695
01:00:26,973 --> 01:00:28,941
Maybe...

696
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:31,133
Maybe it is me.

697
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:35,841
You gotta stop fighting it.
Go with the fIow.

698
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:38,176
Don't be so stiff.

699
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:40,478
Listen to what your
arm's saying to you.

700
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:45,151
What's my arm saying?

701
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:51,325
Right now it's saying,
''Have another drink, oId buddy.''

702
01:00:55,468 --> 01:00:58,869
Now, that's funny. Because that's
just what my Iegs are saying too.

703
01:00:59,038 --> 01:01:02,235
GentIemen.
I'd Iike to propose a toast.

704
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:06,071
To our benefactor, CharIey.

705
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,473
- To CharIey.
- To CharIey.

706
01:01:09,649 --> 01:01:11,310
Thanks, Chuck.

707
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:13,247
Hey.

708
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,085
Hey, asshoIe.

709
01:01:16,656 --> 01:01:18,783
I know you.

710
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:21,786
I've seen you on the TV news.

711
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:24,361
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

712
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,864
Come on, Iet's see the hand.

713
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,563
It's just a hand,
just Iike any other hand.

714
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:33,364
You wanna see mine too?
It's a matched pair.

715
01:01:35,574 --> 01:01:38,668
I wanna see the one from the TV.

716
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:43,812
Hey, come on,
I ain't no circus attraction.

717
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:45,712
Yeah?

718
01:01:45,985 --> 01:01:48,954
You're some kind of fucking freak.

719
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:50,955
I wish he hadn't said that.

720
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,186
Come on.
Let me see the hand.

721
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,794
- Back off, man.
- Come on, Iet me see that hand.

722
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:09,400
Take it outside, come on!

723
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:12,241
HeIIo, poIice.
This is L.B.'s Bar.

724
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:15,244
Get over here right away.
There's a fight going on.

725
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,963
Hey!

726
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:35,128
Move it. Move it!

727
01:02:35,301 --> 01:02:37,360
Somebody get these
peopIe out of here.

728
01:02:37,536 --> 01:02:39,094
Come on, BiII.

729
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:48,303
Everybody get back.

730
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:51,143
What the heII is going on?
Get an ambuIance!

731
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,038
What is up here?

732
01:03:36,796 --> 01:03:38,491
Come on, Iegs.

733
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:38,488
<i>This is Bill Chrushank in exile.</i>
<i>Current location, the Hillcrest Hotel.</i>

734
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:40,682
<i>Well, enough about me.</i>
<i>How are you doing?</i>

735
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,556
<i>Leave a message at the beep,</i>
<i>and tell me all about it.</i>

736
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:46,823
<i>Hey, Bill.</i>
<i>Hey, Bill, it's Mark Draper calling.</i>

737
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,026
Just caIIing to, just, you know,

738
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:52,864
to see what's going on with you.
To see what's up.

739
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:56,599
I'm at home. Just...

740
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:03,338
- Mark?
- <i>No.</i>

741
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:05,211
<i>No!</i>

742
01:06:57,196 --> 01:06:58,458
- HeIIo.
- <i>Karen.</i>

743
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:01,691
- <i>Take the kids, go to your mother's.</i>
- What?

744
01:07:03,202 --> 01:07:05,693
Mark Draper's been murdered.

745
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:07,736
Now, just go.
Just don't pack.

746
01:07:07,906 --> 01:07:09,771
<i>Just go now!</i>

747
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:14,010
Samantha?
BiIIy?

748
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:16,277
Samantha.

749
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:18,177
OK, Iift.

750
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,779
TeII me again.

751
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,551
You were home when you got his caII.

752
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:31,184
And you hadn't seen
Draper since the bar.

753
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:36,667
What was your fight about
at the bar?

754
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:44,172
- We weren't fighting.
- It sounded Iike a fight to me.

755
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:47,369
- He was just trying to stop me.
- Stop what?

756
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,741
Listen, I'm tired.

757
01:07:52,484 --> 01:07:55,544
- You got any more questions?
- Yes, I do.

758
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,123
BiII.

759
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,350
I'm sorry.

760
01:08:02,428 --> 01:08:04,623
I'II have to start asking
them downtown.

761
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:34,352
- You better check with Remo Lacey.
- What for?

762
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:37,519
Because I think his Iife
is in danger.

763
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:27,568
Give me back...

764
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:58,292
You'II be safe.

765
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:02,167
From now on, you'II be with me.

766
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:05,569
I'm not safe.

767
01:11:05,978 --> 01:11:08,173
I'm next.

768
01:12:13,011 --> 01:12:15,844
It's CharIey!

769
01:12:20,886 --> 01:12:22,183
What the heII's going on?

770
01:12:22,354 --> 01:12:24,015
You son of a bitch!

771
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:27,390
- Hang on!
- Look out!

772
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:36,691
Oh, shit!

773
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:39,566
Turn right!
Right, right!

774
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:41,103
Stay on him!

775
01:12:56,421 --> 01:12:58,355
- Stay with him!
- HeIp me, kid.

776
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,686
Shoot him.
Where's your gun?

777
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:03,589
Goddamn it!
Shoot him!

778
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:07,459
No. No, don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him, stop!

779
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:09,366
You son of a bitch!

780
01:13:26,218 --> 01:13:28,982
- Son of a bitch!
- Get out of the fucking way!

781
01:13:30,389 --> 01:13:32,516
Shit!
Go Ieft! Go Ieft!

782
01:13:32,691 --> 01:13:33,953
Shit!

783
01:13:37,763 --> 01:13:39,492
Give me the gun,
I'II shoot him!

784
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:07,153
Shit.

785
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,044
<i>Dearest Karen,</i>

786
01:16:09,414 --> 01:16:12,315
<i>This may be my final journal entry.</i>

787
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:15,078
<i>Having read this,</i>
<i>you know the truth.</i>

788
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:19,246
<i>l hope you understand why</i>
<i>l have to do l what l'm about to do.</i>

789
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:23,224
<i>l love you, Karen. You and the kids</i>
<i>are the best thing l've known.</i>

790
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:24,987
<i>Bill.</i>

791
01:18:38,063 --> 01:18:39,587
WeIcome, BiII.

792
01:18:40,532 --> 01:18:44,559
You wanted to give back
CharIey's arm? We're ready to take it.

793
01:18:49,741 --> 01:18:53,040
You're compIeteIy out
of your fucking mind.

794
01:18:54,245 --> 01:18:57,646
You're a threat to every
Iiving thing you touch.

795
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:04,788
The grafting on of Iimbs
was onIy the beginning.

796
01:19:06,624 --> 01:19:08,683
The beginning?

797
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:14,093
Saving CharIey FIetcher's head so he
couId run around and kiII peopIe?

798
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,161
That's quite an achievement, doctor.

799
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:20,964
Science, Iike nature,
destroys to buiId.

800
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:24,631
I'm part of a process
that's bigger than aII of us.

801
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:30,810
Now we transpIant heads...

802
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:35,849
...with fuII brain chemistry
and functions intact.

803
01:19:37,655 --> 01:19:40,488
Don't you see where this can Iead?

804
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:46,557
Yeah.

805
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:49,491
Straight to heII!

806
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:53,196
Fuck you.

807
01:22:03,902 --> 01:22:09,306
Get me Detective Sawchuck.
Homicide.

808
01:22:12,877 --> 01:22:16,005
- <i>Homicide.</i>
- This is Chrushank.

809
01:22:17,715 --> 01:22:19,910
I'm over at the cIinic.

810
01:22:20,618 --> 01:22:23,212
CharIey FIetcher's dead.

811
01:22:23,621 --> 01:22:25,987
I've got Dr. Webb here.

812
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:28,288
You better get over here.

813
01:23:00,325 --> 01:23:04,284
<i>As l sit here today, the only survivor</i>
<i>of Dr. Webb's experiments,</i>

814
01:23:04,462 --> 01:23:06,623
<i>l feel somewhat resigned.</i>

815
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:09,995
<i>The questions l've been asking</i>
<i>are quite simply beyond my reach.</i>

816
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:13,704
<i>Where does evil live?</i>
<i>ls evil in the flesh?</i>

817
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:17,136
<i>lf a tree falls in the forest,</i>
<i>and nobody is there to hear it,</i>

818
01:23:17,308 --> 01:23:19,606
<i>does it make a sound?</i>

819
01:23:19,777 --> 01:23:23,907
<i>lnquiring minds want to know.</i>
<i>And life goes on.</i>

820
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,107
<i>l do know that evil</i>
<i>does not live in my arm,</i>

821
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:28,548
<i>because since Charley has died,</i>
<i>l've experienced</i>

822
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,746
<i>none of the violent tendencies</i>
<i>the arm initially manifested.</i>

823
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:35,188
<i>l've adjusted and accepted</i>
<i>the fact that l am the recipient</i>

824
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,885
<i>of a miraculous</i>
<i>new surgical technique.</i>

825
01:23:38,062 --> 01:23:42,465
<i>And to that end,</i>
<i>l owe Dr. Webb and Charley.</i>

826
01:23:42,634 --> 01:23:44,829
<i>The arm's mine now, Chuck.</i>

827
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:48,370
<i>l won it, fair and square.</i>

828
01:23:54,545 --> 01:23:56,376
You're not Ieaving those
Iast Iines in, are you?

829
01:23:56,547 --> 01:23:57,809
Sure.

830
01:23:57,982 --> 01:23:59,813
I thought you said
it was gonna be pubIished

831
01:23:59,984 --> 01:24:01,246
in the <i>Journal of Medicine</i>?

832
01:24:01,419 --> 01:24:04,354
It is. I just thought
I'd inject a IittIe humor.

833
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:08,155
WeII, then it's briIIiant.

834
01:24:08,326 --> 01:24:12,285
- You think so?
- The rest of it ain't so bad either.

835
01:24:12,463 --> 01:24:14,328
I Iove you.
