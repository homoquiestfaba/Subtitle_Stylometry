1
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,124
AMBITIOUS

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,392
If you want to know, had this
Hucklberry problem with Finn.

3
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,571
I mean,

4
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,671
Li, and is good at everything.

5
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,880
The trip to America and everything.

6
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,278
But that only made me stop.

7
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,986
I had literature in the 1st period.

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,630
And I should mention the river,

9
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,631
was when I thought about it ...

10
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,672
... In a way not to stand still.

11
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,452
Hey, man, ever stolen anything before?

12
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,550
Not really, not a car.

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,417
Wait.

14
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,119
It's random I suppose, like everything else.

15
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,046
Stealing a car from someone?

16
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,091
Yeah, I mean, there may be an exchange.

17
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:08,194
How is Mercer?

18
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,020
As my friend Jason said
I could not have done.

19
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,799
Can I borrow your shirt?

20
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,944
Shit!

21
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,753
Shit! Shit! Shit!

22
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,217
Hello?

23
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,214
You do not look much like a thief.

24
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,281
I talk to?

25
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,818
With whom? It is my car and my
phone you are talking about ...

26
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,123
... And do not try to be polite, right.

27
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,061
Try not know,
sound crazy or rude.

28
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,556
I do garden work.

29
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,461
- Garden?
- To compensate.

30
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,501
When returning the car,
after the trip.

31
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,332
It has a trip?

32
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,937
Oh, Jesus Christ!
I have no garden, have a car.

33
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,110
Not only is the garden, I can do
other works of their choice.

34
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,651
No. Tell me, think that life is
random or is there fate?

35
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,653
Because these are
the two explanations.

36
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,530
What? Two explanations for what?

37
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,199
For you, Mercer.

38
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,135
Oh, shit, espaquete
're at the point, I must go.

39
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,699
- Wait. What?
- No, it hurts my poscoço say so.

40
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,050
You see? Not everyone can see.

41
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,426
You are the brother of Arlen.

42
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,497
You do not even look like him.

43
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:19,238
I mean, he is more
old Mexican.

44
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,663
The Latin.

45
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,539
There are so many countries there to
down is crazy.

46
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,073
He is my half-brother.
Is he here?

47
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,207
Nick. Ask Nick.
Nick should know.

48
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:36,121
Nick, a good guy. Well,
so good, you know.

49
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,523
The furnace of Nick in the city.
Want Candy?

50
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,019
Nick needs to sweets.

51
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,860
Nick likes to say, sweet.

52
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,867
Jesus Christ.

53
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,905
Come with me?

54
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,872
- I?
- Yes, come.

55
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,585
You are the brother of Arlen?

56
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,456
Tell him that this is
for accessories.

57
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,802
- Fuck, fuck.
- What happened?

58
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,636
Hurt the fuck out of my hand.

59
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,070
- Ahh! Why did this?
- He is the brother of Arlen.

60
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,074
- I know. Honey, come here.
- Son of a bitch.

61
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:09,681
I'll bring ice. We have a
first aid kit.

62
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,672
Come. No.

63
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,962
Arlen stole ...

64
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,473
Arlen stole a toolbox
that belonged to my father ...

65
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,583
... Who had a game
accessories for 50 years.

66
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,990
Moreover, not finished
wood oven tunnel ...

67
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,467
... That was the reason I bring it here
and taught to burn the pots.

68
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,903
This is where Mary said
he is.

69
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,877
Reno?

70
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,878
You're doing a building,
Mary said.

71
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,644
Came a postcard last year.

72
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,180
Reno is near Fallon?

73
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,657
I know a girl
Fallon, Nevada.

74
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,091
When was the last time
who saw the Arlen?

75
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,126
I was five, he 23.
He is 18 years older than me.

76
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,129
So you do not know?

77
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,075
It is probably best
the long term.

78
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,786
I was Buddhist, but still
love everyone.

79
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,048
Except that's fucked Arlen.

80
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,629
Let's eat.

81
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,600
If you want, you can stay
here a little.

82
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,398
Working in Anagami,
earn some money.

83
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,008
We still have to dig
the damn thing.

84
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,841
There are some beautiful girls.
Mary makes paella.

85
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,444
Seriously, it's better to know
The Arlen, believe me.

86
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,656
My father said: "If you do not know where you are
going, you better stop where you are. "

87
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,034
- Never smoked marijuana.
- It's nice.

88
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,075
Does anyone know if Reno
Fallon is near?

89
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,640
I know a girl who studied the
secondary to me, in Fallon, Nevada.

90
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,514
Oh, God, it's nice to feel hungry.

91
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,123
Right? Hungry.

92
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,888
He is. It has a watermelon festival there ...

93
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,631
... Fallon is near Reno.

94
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,899
Melon has a delicious flavor.

95
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,069
Once we got to 50 ...

96
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,638
... Provo to Reno with my mom
camping in the Great Basin ...

97
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,741
... Where she got giardia,
which is not fun.

98
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,388
Thought it was going to shit all over the place.
She prayed to God!

99
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,325
Not funny.

100
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,826
Not funny. It was a
semester without teaching.

101
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,222
My mother was the
substitute teacher.

102
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,227
Really? Where is she now?

103
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,875
- Maybe he did not want to talk about this.
- Oh, no, okay.

104
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,777
Okay, my mother is ...

105
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,117
My mother competes in races
sled dogs in Fairbanks.

106
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,212
No way! With dogs and whips?

107
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,921
- Has its own brand of lashes.
- Really?

108
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,096
Oh, God!

109
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,556
No, no. In fact,
she is dead.

110
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,829
- Really it is.
- With the dogs running behind.

111
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,809
- Dead.
- No.

112
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,910
- No, it's a substitute teacher dead.
- No.

113
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,380
She's hot.
- Your mother?

114
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:23,356
The girl in Fallon. It would be perfect
take it to Reno.

115
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,225
If you ... If you ...

116
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,796
If you missed female companionship.

117
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,373
That is something ...

118
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,966
That is something I ...

119
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,373
That is something I ...

120
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,114
Let me give you something that Arlen did.

121
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,584
- Maybe this old pot ..
- He is my half brother.

122
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,222
And I feel that he has stolen
the accessories of his father ...

123
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,597
... Especially if they were memories
of his father. I feel.

124
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,868
But take it easy with Arlen, right?

125
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,670
Why, I mean, he might
may be a thief,

126
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,507
but his mother, our mother,

127
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,212
he does not know yet.

128
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,246
Still do not know, and have passed
eight months and a half.

129
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,988
Already spent eight and a half months.

130
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,646
If I could tell him.
If I could tell him.

131
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:34,599
I do not know, I do not know,
'd be all over.

132
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,437
The bullet went through the nape of the
Sheriff knocking down the horse.

133
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,402
The blood ran down her lips
when Carlson took the Winchester.

134
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,906
End of tape 2.
Insert tape 3.

135
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,285
Chapter December

136
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,988
"A man must have his tricks
Cowboy "Leroy said,

137
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,687
"A pair of cowboy tricks
for when cooler breeze. "

138
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,657
"A wind colder than this?"
Carlson said.

139
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:15,164
Leroy Carlson liked.

140
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,900
Leroy was the only one not
was against him.

141
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,628
To the piano ...

142
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,344
Hello?

143
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,645
Hello?

144
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,848
Yes, I know, sorry.

145
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,372
We were measuring the target
with coincidence

146
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,816
the meaning of life and had to
out because of the spaghetti.

147
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,489
- How do you know my name?
- Where are you?

148
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,193
- I do not know who you are.
- It's fine for now, Mercer.

149
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,631
You have the car.
You can read the road.

150
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,728
- You gave my name to the police?
- No, no police.

151
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,534
- What does it mean?
- I talked to my mother yesterday.

152
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,336
She thinks I should
call the police.

153
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:05,141
But I make a proposal. You turn
to me and tell me your trip.

154
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,215
This is the agreement that I propose.

155
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,612
For me it's fair enough.

156
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,819
Well now you're thinking:

157
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,188
Who is this girl?

158
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,356
What's wrong with her?
She must be crazy.

159
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,166
No, sorry. Sad in a chair ...

160
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,671
... With cats.

161
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,868
Cats? No, crosswords.

162
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,238
A crossword puzzle ...
crosswords and tea.

163
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,804
No, beer.

164
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,583
Beer, it is ... strong?

165
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,920
Think you are strong. But not so.

166
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,255
Imagine the young. No, older.

167
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,184
Imagine it with false teeth.

168
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,393
- Do you really know?
- Do you think about fate?

169
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,503
- How everyone.
- Do not like cooked spaghetti too.

170
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,071
- How everyone.
- It's fun. Are you funny?

171
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,339
- I tend to be.
- When you call me, alone?

172
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,850
Hello?

173
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,933
Hi, this message is for Joely.
It's Mercer.

174
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,629
We studied together in
high school in Eugene.

175
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:48,112
And I'll be in Reno,
Fallon, in fact,

176
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,445
and you know, I'll tell you later.

177
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,391
I have a car.

178
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,858
Mom works with
real estate exposure.

179
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,858
So we pretend that we are sisters and
help when it is a single guy.

180
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,069
Not that something very serious happens.

181
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,776
Just to mess with them, but ends
selling many, many houses.

182
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,481
My cousin Buddy goes here.

183
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,341
We bought beer and see the cracks.

184
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,880
I used to read e-mails with Mom.

185
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,589
she said
"This market is ambitious."

186
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,595
"It's nice?" Just saying.

187
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,502
You're taller now.

188
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:43,998
- My fingers are swollen.
- What have to take the rings?

189
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,108
They gave me a lotion, I think.

190
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,441
- What was it?
- School Receptionist?

191
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,311
You will ... Will go to ...

192
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:58,648
School receptionist, in
next summer in Tucson.

193
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,586
Moby recommended this.

194
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,028
Moby.
Moby?

195
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,932
Mom and I were with her in
backstage at Tahoe Oakland.

196
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,536
She is a wonderful person.

197
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,169
As a person, you know?

198
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,648
You can read and know immediately.

199
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,451
Yes, it is a skill that has.

200
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,817
Then you will see your brother?

201
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,094
In Reno, it is.

202
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,528
- I was wondering ...
- So we go to Reno?

203
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,657
... If you want to come to Reno.

204
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,226
Sorry to move both.

205
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,700
I shaved down there and can burn.

206
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,037
Sorry. Oh, sorry.

207
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,835
Hey, what are you doing?

208
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm not sure, ma'am.

209
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,680
Never done before?

210
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,417
What?

211
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,244
St. Ecstasys.

212
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,323
No, it tasted a lot.

213
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,724
Only marijuana and morphine.

214
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,918
- Wow, this thing is too ...
- It takes 90 minutes.

215
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,355
Yeah, he does.

216
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,420
- Do you have any lotion?
- What?

217
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,492
- Lotion?
- Lotion?

218
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,628
- Or an ointment.
- What kind?

219
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:56,160
- What?
- What kind of ointment?

220
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:02,337
As a jelly. Something that uses
in marital relationships.

221
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:05,966
- Petroleum jelly?
- No, no, no. No, this.

222
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:11,642
- Yes, exactly, Vaseline.
- This helps you get the rings?

223
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:16,686
Yes, ask the nurse.
And ask for another pillow.

224
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,016
- Sure.
- Tell her.

225
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,275
Yes.

226
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,841
My ... My mother is ...

227
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,142
Mrs. White Room 28.

228
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,887
She's um ... is dead.

229
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,897
Needless to say, Joely,
how much I love you.

230
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,691
I mean the details
My love for you.

231
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,764
Starting with your kind heart,

232
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,567
Joely and her ass,
your ass so beautiful.

233
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,609
You're so brave,
but so brave.

234
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,710
- And I see where you shaved.
- Why not take an orange juice?

235
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,565
Do you think that would be fine if we
sex with each other?

236
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:30,116
- Definitely will.
- It would be my first time.

237
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,287
Should I say this?
Can not talk now.

238
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:36,724
So what should be that way.

239
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,163
Tomatoes, cherry tomatoes.
You should eat raw.

240
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,265
They say, fructose, fructose!

241
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,128
Washington, Adams, Jefferson.

242
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,198
Madison, Monroe, Adams,
Jackson, Van Buren.

243
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,639
Harrison, Tyler ... Tyler.

244
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,162
Fuck my pussy hot.

245
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:32,744
Fucked the Fillmore!

246
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,327
- Sorry.
- No.

247
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,363
No. ..
declined.

248
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,957
No, okay.
Okay.

249
00:27:57,957 --> 00:28:00,308
You're so wonderful.

250
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,541
We can try again later.

251
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:15,893
I love you.

252
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,041
Where did you get the shirt
car washer?

253
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,701
My friend J, was in
test your bandwidth.

254
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,270
- You are not in the band?
- No.

255
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,919
Have you ever thought that people do
bands to feel like shit?

256
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,454
Yes Where are you now?

257
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,929
- Reno.
- Reno does not seem his style.

258
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,890
- How do you know?
- I just know.

259
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,426
Yeah, you're right, I guess.

260
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,602
- You're not playing?
- No.

261
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,633
I'm just looking for someone.

262
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,270
Hello, I'm Sergio Leone. It is not my
real name, obviously.

263
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,848
- I am here to ...
- I know.

264
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,383
Among please feel free.

265
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,393
You can wait in the living room.

266
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:28,933
Hear that?

267
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,328
- Do you think you begin?
- Shut up, shut up.

268
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:33,937
Friend, fuck, seriously.

269
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,245
His first time on this also?

270
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,451
Probably, yes.

271
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,228
Have you seen the masks?

272
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,526
- Masks?
- You know? I mean ...

273
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,534
- They taste at all, right?
- Shut the fuck that mouth.

274
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,007
Like to do anal?

275
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,118
Arlen has lived
here a year ago.

276
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,648
But honestly, the
pornography was his idea.

277
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,349
And the credit belongs to those who deserve credit.

278
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,782
I had a rebirth
spiritual underground.

279
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:35,057
Arlen said that would achieve a
camera, capturing the human connection.

280
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,299
And accept the rewards
as they pass ...

281
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,171
... Like bears and salmon.

282
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,606
Have you read Rumi? The human river
which never ceases,

283
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:54,818
you and I are one. For this thought
in rubber masks.

284
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,352
Will see, using a mask ...

285
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:04,887
A normal guy ...
face the camera ...

286
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,329
... And protect his identity.

287
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,391
And as the identity,
what consciousness is.

288
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,133
Can you give me the tape
adhesive. Just play.

289
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,775
Even boys who had
came to lose her virginity.

290
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,238
It powers.

291
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,309
But without masks
for women.

292
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,544
We need the groans.

293
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,982
Pain has its own energy.

294
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:33,924
So things are.

295
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,988
- What?
- Laurel.

296
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:38,958
Damn sleazy,
we had a deal.

297
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,700
Laurel!

298
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,265
Arlen never wanted to do
love with these girls.

299
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,975
I do not know why, I am not
owner of the mystery.

300
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,247
You do not look Mexican.

301
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,980
He is my half-brother.

302
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:06,688
I've seen him with this young
West Sacramento.

303
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:11,261
It has an animal house
she managed.

304
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,231
She is older than him too ...

305
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,859
... Which can be comfortable.

306
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:23,240
If you see Arlen, say no
I will complain.

307
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,435
I guess he needs the
more money than me.

308
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,510
I was angry,
was disappointed.

309
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:37,581
But so is America,
Our American River.

310
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:43,255
This lens holds the current
American eye.

311
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,163
I have to go help that
young people to relax.

312
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:57,968
What good is it,
weeping before the fuck.

313
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,753
Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.

314
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,153
It's a little disappointing
never be pursued.

315
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,654
It is officially a
crime spree?

316
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,089
If I knew what it was for this
camera, I think they stole.

317
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,363
- Whose?
- From a friend of my brother.

318
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,967
- Did your brother?
- I'm trying to find.

319
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:09,806
I do not know, it seems
is not the best.

320
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,914
Some things would have heard
killed my mother, if possible.

321
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,921
His mother died?

322
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,260
Yes.

323
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,555
That's what I have to tell him.

324
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,535
Sorry.

325
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,701
It's just you and your father?

326
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,608
My father? No, I do not know my father.

327
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,503
Who you are now?

328
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,652
A French teacher, and his
family. Put them nervous.

329
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,621
If you do not watch TV, put
people nervous.

330
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,722
You're in a swimming pool?

331
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,730
Yes, something like that.

332
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,100
What is your age?

333
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,902
What is your age?

334
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,172
I'm 19, but probably
already know this.

335
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,977
I saw your glasses for near,
know how old people.

336
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,211
I am an old person.

337
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,711
I hope you do not mind,
because I wear your glasses.

338
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,654
- Sometimes I think I need glasses.
- What's mine is yours.

339
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:29,793
Try the pepper spray.

340
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,826
Oh, well, I thought it was a
asthma inhaler.

341
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,557
I was worried about you.

342
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,494
Kind of you.

343
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,365
It's nice to know that someone
cares about you.

344
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,204
But I'm fine, Mercer.

345
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,946
I'm 24.

346
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:26,783
Hey, you.

347
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,882
Hey, you bring the food
in here, son.

348
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,592
Hey! Hey, Mercer.

349
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,998
This is my cousin Buddy and he is the Rid.

350
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,794
We were just waiting for you.

351
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,102
- This kid is going to lead us in Mojave?
- Getting where?

352
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:53,999
Reid and Buddy are building
a stock car for a long time ...

353
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:58,273
... In a junkyard in the Mojave that is
Reid's friend, so it is free.

354
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,746
They are euphoric and
're nice guys.

355
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,486
And it is basically ready,

356
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,659
then I said it would take
in Mojave to get it.

357
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,760
So let's go, shall we?

358
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,859
Yes Mojave is near Sacramento?

359
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:23,800
- Arlen maybe Sacramento.
- No, no, I mean is to the south.

360
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,235
Come on, is not it?
A short drive?

361
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,277
Do not want to try again?

362
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,492
We have to pack.

363
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,796
It was the best part of the west
Carlson heard them say.

364
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,509
Where can achieve
away from people.

365
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,679
You are more free than
had ever been.

366
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,913
In the west you could drop
things where they fell.

367
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,574
Where he got this camera?

368
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,576
I do not know, just a camera.
Has tea that shit?

369
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,412
It is a drug effect. All
camera has this shit?

370
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,148
It is tied into it, darling.

371
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,047
Someone should make a movie
long with this effect.

372
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:43,176
We will do our
own movie at the hotel.

373
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,615
Now drop this camera.

374
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,181
- Yes, fuck.
- Oh, shit, do it again.

375
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,192
It's great.

376
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,556
Let's look into what is done.

377
00:39:55,626 --> 00:40:00,427
How's your mother?
It was always weird.

378
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,294
It is my mother ... it looks good.

379
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,164
Is doing his ritual walk.

380
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,376
His what?

381
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,012
She is the Australian desert,
doing ritual walk.

382
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,242
What is a ritual walk?

383
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,677
It's like a barmitzvah.

384
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,016
- Jewish?
- No.

385
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,351
You're not religious?

386
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,585
My mother was religious.

387
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:42,063
She was from Pointe Coupee Parish,
Louisiana. There are all Catholics.

388
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,010
She was kind of hippie.

389
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:54,144
With all the boyfriends, and I had
when he was older, by 45.

390
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,882
But went to church every week
St. Mary.

391
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,653
He spoke of it with you, in the end?
God, or things like that?

392
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,057
No. In the end I was unconscious.

393
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,533
All I could do was clean his
those with long mouth swabs.

394
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,737
I never said this to anyone.

395
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,805
People have deposit
calcium, tongue and mouth.

396
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,046
... When they are dying.

397
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,847
And the nurses gave me
swabs to clean,

398
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,048
like she cared,
anyway.

399
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:37,256
Not much fun, but you do.

400
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,629
What else could I do?

401
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:48,000
Smells ... Kate smells so bad,
could never tell you.

402
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,342
You know my name?

403
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,544
Yes, I found your gym bag,
and his YMCA card.

404
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,812
Found my bag
gym? Where were you?

405
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,053
It was behind where the
spare tire should be.

406
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,060
I'll be back with everything.

407
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,664
Can you show me the trip,
now that you have a camera.

408
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,962
Yes, I suppose I should
shooting things.

409
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,704
Scenario! Not within what.

410
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,773
If you could do a film if
all we could do a movie.

411
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,108
- What film would perhaps?
- A French film, my own.

412
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:38,980
Ends dancing, no
good reason, just for dancing.

413
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,055
There would be two dancing?

414
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,328
Three.

415
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,245
That sounds cool.

416
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,126
So I think one should do
movie with people dancing.

417
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:52,662
Yeah, I do not know.

418
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:59,232
I think people
dislike more.

419
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:19,990
What's happening?

420
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,191
Just got out of my way, I
finding my brother Arlen.

421
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,295
Hey, will not do it, buddy.

422
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,671
I got out of my way.

423
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,320
No.

424
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,365
Hey! Hey!

425
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,340
I must find my brother Arlen.

426
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,944
- What are you doing, drop it.
- We should go.

427
00:44:44,944 --> 00:44:47,445
- I must find my brother.
- Bring him to the room?

428
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:51,883
- Stop, I must find my brother.
- Come in, motherfucker.

429
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,994
Everything will be alright,
her mother will return. 

430
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:06,736
Australia.

431
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:25,753
I know how. Be different.

432
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,184
- No.
- By God.

433
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,726
- Fuck.
- I must find my brother.

434
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:35,622
- Okay.
- Can not get the car.

435
00:45:35,622 --> 00:45:37,994
- It's not my car.
- Well, the car is whose?

436
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,262
It's my girlfriend.

437
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,035
You have a girlfriend?

438
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,677
Fuck.

439
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,647
Honey, go to the car.

440
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,323
You're so selfish.

441
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:07,664
Do not do it, kid.

442
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,393
Do not fuck with the heart of Buddy.

443
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,462
He is very strong,
but not like this.

444
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,636
Do not try to enter
contact with him. No.

445
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:53,700
Do you feel that sometimes too early
or too late for everything?

446
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:58,239
As my mom said that people
sing and chatter all the time.

447
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:04,044
Just because they want to. I
weird that.

448
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,919
Yeah, I had to leave
school last year ...

449
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,796
... To help my mother to die.

450
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,129
- All my friends graduated.
- You know the Irish song?

451
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:19,929
My mother used to
sing to me.

452
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,596
No, how?

453
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,710
Shit! Shit! I think
the battery is running low.

454
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,007
Plug it into the cigarette lighter.
Is in the car?

455
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,377
Kate, you should say something to you.

456
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,281
- You have a girlfriend?
- No, no.

457
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,889
It's just that I strayed a bit here e. ..

458
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,822
Hey? Hey?
Kate?

459
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,964
Not far away, you say?
Mojave?

460
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,592
80 kilometers.
I'll tell you something.

461
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,368
Someone who goes in my car arrives.

462
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,176
What's on your mind?

463
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,005
See my brother, Arlen.

464
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,081
- They are close?
- Yes

465
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,787
Good

466
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,386
When traveling either alone or
forget the people who have.

467
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,026
I am a seller of liquor.
And you?

468
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,528
No, I am employed.

469
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,267
Meet a man with his clothes
hanging in the back seat,

470
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:07,639
that can tell you two
things about the loneliness.

471
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:13,309
The first thing I can say is,
that does not result in anything.

472
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:19,817
This shit lone ranger,
is false as Christmas.

473
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,521
My blood turned into gasoline.

474
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,692
The other thing that can
say is, protection.

475
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,332
If you have to be on the road.

476
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,263
Arlen probably told you
about carrying weapons.

477
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,172
Traveling in your car,
probably has a pocket.

478
00:49:42,172 --> 00:49:45,247
I mean, I think
prefer the same.

479
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,142
Do not want to meddle in
Arlen told you that, but ...

480
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,381
I have my own ideas ...
about protection

481
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,822
Use of weapons in almost
cost our country.

482
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,174
That's Protection!

483
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,199
That's Protection!

484
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:19,173
Lord Jim Corbett. Type bull Mills
fists to fight.

485
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,480
Protection that was born with it.
Natural protection,

486
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,320
... As Jesus and globules
white blood.

487
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,587
You know what I have
pride in Mojave?

488
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,161
To take the bull by the tail
as before.

489
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,155
Before America forget how.

490
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,592
And who else would know
pride? His brother.

491
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,099
There were times when Carlson
wanted to ride alone.

492
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,737
Could use another shooter.

493
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,733
Carlson threw to first
his father taught IHE ...

494
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,037
... And went straight into the ear of the sheriff.

495
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,277
Someone attacked her from behind and Carlson
staggered, but it was unbreakable.

496
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,780
While Carlson staggered avoided
twice the sickle with his arm.

497
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,792
Give the boy his hat.

498
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,028
You actually do not
has a brother, do you?

499
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,403
No and yes.

500
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,596
Nobody taught you to fight?

501
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,910
I should have said. I never sent
a man to fight ...

502
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,016
... To see him lose his hat.

503
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:07,650
I have my ideas about fighting, but
need tools to live.

504
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,862
I can not give you this, would give.

505
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,298
My parents gave me the
my confirmation.

506
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,908
Get a knife for you ...

507
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,874
... To anyone
take off your hat.

508
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,836
Do you like novels
cowboys in particular?

509
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,999
He listened to the cd the book?

510
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,704
Yes, half. I
the tape two or three.

511
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,010
You can hear the rest when you return.

512
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:06,249
Right.

513
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,244
I was considering
something that I do not know.

514
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,012
Yes, I know, I mean ...

515
00:53:15,012 --> 00:53:17,693
... I think people would like,
but really want to know ...

516
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,193
... What your dog and
your cat think?

517
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,794
- Yes, I did not want this power?
- No.

518
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:29,264
And if they were so disappointing
like humans ...

519
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,908
... And not think of anything.

520
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:41,010
And just think where they would
to college.

521
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:45,882
- And where would a second option.
- Once, I talked to a squirrel.

522
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,722
I was just walking alone
and saw a bush ...

523
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,492
... And I said:
Hey, how's it going?

524
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,133
And he said "Ee-ee-ee."

525
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:08,106
So I said, "Need
something like a juice or milk? "

526
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,212
And he said
"Aa-aa-aa".

527
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:13,280
What kind of ice cream do you like?

528
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,285
What kind of ice cream?

529
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:22,047
Yes, if I had to choose
a taste right now.

530
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,386
I do not know if I have one.

531
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,530
I'll let you think about it.
I go to bed now.

532
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,701
When you go back?

533
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,935
Very soon, I think.
I'm done with Joely.

534
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:48,178
Who is Joely?
Joely is a girl?

535
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:54,346
No. Well, yes.
I mean, yes.

536
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:59,184
It's a girl, but not so.
Forgiveness should not.

537
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,357
I in the west
Sacramento tomorrow.

538
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:10,334
Arlen meets a girl there that
Hal works in the shop's Pet.

539
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,670
I mean, it's not a girl,
is a woman.

540
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,342
Arlen is like me, like
older women.

541
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,151
Hello?

542
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,022
Hello?

543
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,892
Wait a friend. I'm trying
Mangione catch the wave.

544
00:56:06,892 --> 00:56:08,361
- Do you understand?
- Wait.

545
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,132
We have no public restroom
dear. Try the Winchells.

546
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,562
Oh, no. I'm looking for
Arlen White.

547
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,842
Oh fucked me!

548
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,178
There was Scott.

549
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,070
He heard the name of Arlen and
just thought the police.

550
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,980
... And this is what happens when
on parole, believe me.

551
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:35,614
Scott is a boy, anyway.
Hey, you sing?

552
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,892
- So Arlen is not here?
- Fuck! No.

553
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:40,052
Arlen it was when we were arrested.

554
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:42,960
Hi! Welcome to Hal's Pet.

555
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,365
Oh, there's a little problem with ...

556
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:51,696
... Filled with two checks
at odds with the law ...

557
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:57,509
... And some of us are free
conditional. Want to relax?

558
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,345
- No.
- Breakfast? It's important. Well

559
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,448
Arlen was nervous and went to L.A.

560
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:07,919
This is the number he gave me,
but I had left into it.

561
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,820
... Because it's so traditional that Arlen.

562
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,864
He likes it:
"One man, one woman."

563
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:19,901
And I: "Put that damn Holmes
and hands on my body. "

564
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:22,834
- Choose and then choose, right?
- Right.

565
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:26,439
Right? No seriously, my dear,
can sing?

566
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,942
- Because it is Arlen L.A. ..
- This is the deal.

567
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,682
The condition of our freedom is
make this community service

568
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:37,787
Christian songs and stories
idiots daycare.

569
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,479
And you just
scaring our singer.

570
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,821
- You want me in your band?
- No, not a band.

571
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:51,425
Yeah, you want the band.

572
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,932
- You know songs?
- I know some, yes.

573
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,237
Wait a minute, you do not
is a religious fanatic?

574
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,641
Because, well never mind. Forget it.
I can not choose.

575
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:05,773
- Dutch will give you a jacket.
- You are number 40?

576
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,083
- I have to ...
- Last chance.

577
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,116
- No, thanks.
- Right.

578
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,393
What?

579
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,690
I've never been in a band before.

580
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,996
There is a band are 140 hours
community service.

581
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,224
While this world.

582
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,995
Full of demons.

583
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:02,193
Threatens our faith.

584
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,298
Not fear

585
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:09,103
Because God wants.

586
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:15,515
His real triumph for us.

587
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,419
Wow, that was great.

588
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,452
Can you give me the jacket
and the drum? Um, guys?

589
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:26,795
Sure, what do we do?

590
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,864
Guys?

591
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,061
This part is not for you,
honey. Let there e. ..

592
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,829
... Is a thing of the band.
But there were great.

593
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:41,901
Gave people what they
wanted, God, cream cheese.

594
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,378
It was brilliant. Who are you?
It is my lifeline.

595
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:46,947
But it's over for you.

596
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,246
Hear me, tell Arlen ...

597
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:58,917
... You tell Arlen still
keep praying for him.

598
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,887
Hey!

599
01:00:27,887 --> 01:00:29,887
Hey! This is my car!

600
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,118
Is it?
It's your car?

601
01:00:36,406 --> 01:00:38,655
- How did you know where?
- Hal's Pet said ...

602
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:41,363
... In Sacramento, idiot.
Now give me the keys to the door.

603
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:43,374
- Already have the ignition.
- Sorry.

604
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:46,050
- Give me the keys.
- Kate, I'm sorry for the girl, Joely.

605
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:49,429
I do not care about that, just
I want my car back.

606
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:50,841
Damn thief, give me the keys.

607
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:53,007
- Give me that fucking key.
- Nothing happened really.

608
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:02,304
It will be my first time.

609
01:01:08,508 --> 01:01:10,642
You lied to me e. ..

610
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:16,414
I thought I knew ...
one to the other e. ..

611
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:22,504
... And nobody knows
no one in the end?

612
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:57,012
I stink, my body.

613
01:01:58,748 --> 01:01:59,715
No, you're not.

614
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,742
We just talk about
lies, just now.

615
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,325
Sure, you stink. I noticed.

616
01:02:16,883 --> 01:02:18,412
You're an idiot, idiot. idiot.

617
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,011
But I liked the sound of your voice.

618
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,752
This person is a great explorer?

619
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,692
Oh, you're very bad at this game.

620
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,393
Fifteen questions and do not know if it is
a man or a woman, yet.

621
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,961
I have my methods that can
unless the methods of its staff

622
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,403
No, it's a great explorer.

623
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,408
Set me.

624
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,084
What?

625
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,639
It is the machine again.

626
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,304
Hi, this is a message
for Arlen.

627
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,708
It's your brother, I think, I left you ...

628
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,944
I called earlier and left
a cell phone number.

629
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:52,925
It might ask you to call me?
Thank you.

630
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,801
It was good.

631
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,659
What is this? It's horrible.
I do not know what it is.

632
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,061
It's not a Big Mac burger.

633
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:28,931
Can I prove it?

634
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,998
I'm divorced.

635
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,706
We were very young and
people lie to you ...

636
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,305
... And confuse everything.

637
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:57,122
Lied at the university and when
Cirillo worked in the kitchen.

638
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:03,459
It is a restaurant affiliate
the Humble Bagel.

639
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,127
Yeah, I used to go to Humble Bagel
always after school.

640
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,164
I know. I saw you.

641
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:19,507
So, when I stole your car?
You recognize me?

642
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:26,045
Yes, but not the whole story.

643
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,092
There's something not
I can tell you now.

644
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,257
Kate, you're not?

645
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,359
You're okay, right?

646
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:47,336
You're not sick or
dying or something?

647
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:51,438
No! No, I'm fine.

648
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:04,252
I used to go biking through the streets of
Amazon to work every day.

649
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,990
I love to cook.

650
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:13,830
Worked 1 to 12 hours with these
weird faces, faces criminal.

651
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,871
And I was, um ...

652
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:24,368
Tendonitis and smelled ...
rancid butter.

653
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,447
And was very happy
with it, too.

654
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,414
And my hands are like steel.

655
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,724
You can burn them and not feel anything.

656
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,151
All those knives and blood.

657
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:42,690
As we had no brain.

658
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,858
The kitchen looked like a brain.

659
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,106
And it was really nice.

660
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:05,178
It was the dream I had tonight.
Maybe you had too.

661
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,053
I could pass through
our feet.

662
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,196
Carlson left a little Brands
before he gets there,

663
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:58,330
... Back to the crossroads.

664
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:02,366
Rid never understood why
Carlson wanted to be alone.

665
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:06,674
Reid had never lost anyone before,
and it still had hope.

666
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:12,073
For Carlson was from
a shortcut and a shield.

667
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,910
The more you leave,
unless you lose.

668
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,153
Hi! Hi, I'm calling for Arlen.

669
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:34,529
With Arlen.

670
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,455
Could you please ...

671
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,594
No English?

672
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:42,637
Is he there?

673
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,518
Is calling.

674
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,323
Well, she seemed very angry.

675
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:04,290
I do not know, just be polite.

676
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:10,291
Do not yell, bitch! Let me know
White is Arlen is there.

677
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:13,001
It's not there.

678
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,630
He said he split his
older sister, hell!

679
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:22,140
He said he likes to fuck
older chickens.

680
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,306
Seriously, I need your help.

681
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:26,972
Try to be nice.

682
01:11:27,733 --> 01:11:30,318
Love, not my dick
Whatever your age,

683
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:32,833
Can I help you down there.

684
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,515
Totally disgusted. Said
I have no dick.

685
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,724
- I dig this girl.
- Please.

686
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:42,228
Alright, alright.

687
01:11:42,595 --> 01:11:47,455
Sure, my sky ... I'll call you
when this boy has gone,

688
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,894
So you know ...
when they come here.

689
01:11:49,894 --> 01:11:52,298
But for now, tell me
Arlen is there?

690
01:11:53,381 --> 01:11:54,613
Hotel Las Rosas.

691
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:59,410
The sister who was with Arlen
Aromatherapy makes this hotel.

692
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:00,913
Where?

693
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,651
Ensenada.

694
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:06,887
- Ensenada, Mexico?
- The hotel is in Ensenada, Mexico?

695
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,257
- Right.
- Mexico.

696
01:12:13,555 --> 01:12:16,414
Call you in five minutes
have a conversation.

697
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,396
- Do you know where I can sell a camera?
- Now?

698
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,072
Passing MacArthur Park
Best Liquor opposite is true.

699
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,573
Need something else?

700
01:12:28,573 --> 01:12:31,974
Why I call this chicken
soon, I need tea to ten.

701
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:33,381
Without offending his brother.

702
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,040
Who is it?

703
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,805
Someone else used the camera.

704
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,407
- Will you be selling?
- Yes,

705
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:08,611
Hey, we're talking
right now.

706
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:12,549
Actually, no.
It has something to say?

707
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:17,450
No, I thought maybe we could
play 20 questions.

708
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,280
Hey, kid, can not come here.

709
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,855
This is not a good hotel.

710
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:25,860
Go.

711
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,567
Arlen?

712
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,270
What?

713
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,205
No, no.

714
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,470
No, I ...

715
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,035
How'd you find me?

716
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:46,277
I have no money.

717
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:50,516
No, I. ..
Arlen, did not come for money.

718
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,948
Mom sent you here
for me to help.

719
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:54,851
- Arlen.
- What?

720
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:59,151
Raise you?
That bitch was crazy?

721
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,327
Where were you?

722
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:11,606
It did not take care of me.

723
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,031
Why should I care for you?

724
01:15:14,033 --> 01:15:16,285
He's just a kid away from home
attempting to enter the hotel!

725
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,517
Do not want your hat, cowboy?

726
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,887
Hey, Cowboy!

727
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,059
His hat.
Cowboy.

728
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:13,835
Beats kid!

729
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,197
Bate. Bate.

730
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,240
Bate.

731
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,536
Okay. Chat!

732
01:16:25,351 --> 01:16:27,303
Hey, you okay?

733
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,146
Feel, feel.

734
01:16:31,368 --> 01:16:33,482
There's blood in the face ...
Need Help?

735
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:34,549
Coming.

736
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:38,108
The courtyard entrance is around the corner ...
here we have an infirmary.

737
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:17,999
Can I?

738
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,284
Cowboy.
You're so selfish.

739
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,523
Cowboy.

740
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,156
There's something out there.
Think about it.

741
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,400
This is ...
Fructose.

742
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:09,917
Mercer.

743
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:11,811
No! I'll tell you.

744
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,357
Are you okay?

745
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:25,029
You found me.

746
01:18:25,029 --> 01:18:27,793
Yes, the number still
was on the phone.

747
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,295
That girl told me
where you could be.

748
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,203
I thought we were
traveling together.

749
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,866
Jesus!
What is this thing?

750
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:08,136
Books e. .. Books and ash.

751
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,284
Want to disperse them here?

752
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:22,590
No.

753
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:25,960
Louisiana.

754
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:31,256
Two cousins ??who still have there,
in Pointe Coupee Parish,

755
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:33,927
The sister of my mother.

756
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,337
I thought ...

757
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,839
... If he found the Arlen,
maybe it was me there

758
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,484
but ...

759
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,261
If ...

760
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:04,732
What?

761
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:10,569
If it was not just because
I recognized you.

762
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:19,641
I let my take
car because I thought ...

763
01:20:19,641 --> 01:20:22,545
... That could be a sign.

764
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,054
Because ...

765
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:30,998
I not only ...

766
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,426
... Used to see him at the restaurant.

767
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:43,796
I liked you.

768
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,573
And I had ...

769
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,302
... Had a ...

770
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,479
... Had this fantasy with you.

771
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:04,525
Dividiríamos that an ice cream.

772
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:09,725
We would ask for a double ice cream
mint chocolate and coffee ...

773
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:11,498
... And we would sit in Thugman ...

774
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:15,433
Dividiríamos ... and ice cream.

775
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:23,010
It's just that?
This is all a. ..

776
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,576
No, it was not. It was not
all fantasy.

777
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,984
But then, when I saw you
the car wash,

778
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,914
... And saw him sitting in my car

779
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,954
you seemed to fit him.

780
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:41,829
And I just ...

781
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,894
... Wanted to go out driving with you ...

782
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,503
the Dari Mart

783
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,735
or to wander.

784
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,611
Just someone to wander.

785
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:07,987
Kate wants to go to Louisiana with me?

786
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:12,860
This is my car.

787
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:17,797
I know. But even if it was not.

788
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,795
What did I do?

789
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,396
I just have to go to the bathroom.

790
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,104
You better take your clothes off.

791
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:15,884
It Fillmore, Fillmore, you bastard.

792
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:20,493
Pierce, Buchanan, Lincoln,

793
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,160
murder, emancipation.

794
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,462
Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur.

795
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,275
What?

796
01:25:09,423 --> 01:25:10,401
How did it happen?

797
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:16,533
He moved to the liver, but
began with lung cancer.

798
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,808
- Are you fucking me?
- No.

799
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:28,318
Spent eight and a half months,
almost nine.

800
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:30,858
Nine months.

801
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:32,059
Jesus.

802
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,221
I, you know.

803
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,199
Everything I said would not.

804
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,726
Sorry, I was an idiot.

805
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:47,097
It's funny, the things that
want to leave out. know?

806
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:06,019
Have you ever had a friend who
started a band e. ..

807
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:11,526
It was only his friend, and then began
a band and you were not there?

808
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:16,532
Yeah, always wanted to be in a band.

809
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,744
My friend Billy Kleinsasser,
started a band a year.

810
01:26:25,744 --> 01:26:30,908
What if you could learn drums
I would be on it.

811
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:36,521
And I said to my mother, she had just
have you, and was with her boyfriend.

812
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,386
His father, what's his name?

813
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:43,626
- Ted something.
- Well, the old Ted fucked

814
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,589
Said it would be a lot of noise
for the baby.

815
01:26:45,589 --> 01:26:47,995
What is a pile of manure, because
Babies do not care about anything.

816
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:51,395
It was just for him.

817
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,542
He never lived there, but Mom
I was in love with him.

818
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:01,676
It was not that.

819
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,050
I mean, I do not know.

820
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,611
She wanted to try something better
with you, you know.

821
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:09,790
You were a second chance.

822
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,588
Whenever someone tries to make a
band makes us feel like shit.

823
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:18,626
I have to return to the office.

824
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,534
- I have the ashes of the mother.
- No, no, no, no, no.

825
01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:28,970
Do not take this fucking thing here,
Please. Could lose my job.

826
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:34,136
No, no.
I'll take them.

827
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,181
Kate and I will take them
Pointe Coupee Parish.

828
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:43,613
Just wanted to know if I wanted.

829
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,226
No, no.
I. ..

830
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:54,761
No, seriously, just let me know.

831
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:57,861
'll Buy one
Pay-per-view or something.

832
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:10,344
Hey, take care. Louisiana is like
a 3rd world country.

833
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:45,719
Okay, I have one.

834
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:52,715
It is your personal life?

835
01:28:57,148 --> 01:28:57,648
Is it?

836
01:29:00,348 --> 01:29:01,601
He is a man?
