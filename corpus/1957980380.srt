0
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,508
Wait for me. I have to change real quick!

1
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,061
I'm sorry, they're waiting
for me. I have to go.

2
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,313
- See you later, bye!
- Okay, be safe!

3
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,374
Nadia?

4
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,300
What are you doing here?

5
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,931
Please let me go!

6
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
Please let me go!

7
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,450
What are you doing?

8
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,371
Please let me go!

9
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,457
Please let me go! I don't wanna die!!

10
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,135
Help me!

11
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,770
Help me! Help me!!

12
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,944
Why are you doing this
to me? Please, let me go!

13
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,123
Let me go please!!

14
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,087
Please let me go!

15
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,298
Let me go!

16
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,097
Why are you doing this to me?!

17
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,185
Why are you doing this, I don't wanna die!!

18
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,234
Please let me go!

19
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,404
No! No! No!

20
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,033
No! No! No!

21
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,745
No! No! No!

22
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,617
- Are you recording?
- Yes, Doctor Fabrizi...

23
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:04,382
The left end of the injury started below
the ear at upper third of the neck...

24
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,864
and deepened gradually
with severance of the left carotid artery.

25
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,184
What the hell...

26
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,395
Still recording, Doctor...

27
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,938
Please, stop it.

28
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,397
Stopped.

29
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,067
I need to think about this...

30
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,756
- Are you trying to run me over?
- I'm trying to save our jobs!

31
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,944
- What's that supposed to mean?
- The podcast starts in half an hour!

32
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,636
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

33
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,638
The show starts at 10, and it's only...

34
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,601
- 8:30!
- Wrong! Daylight saving time ended last night.

35
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,769
Oh no!

36
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,064
You forgot to change your watch... again.

37
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,984
- Shit! What are we gonna do?
- Hurry! We still can make it!

38
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,405
But I can't go like this! I
need to take a shower first!

39
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,033
Impossible! No time!

40
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,121
At least I wanna
smell good when they fire us!

41
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,124
Nobody is gonna fire
us! We've got all the sponsors!

42
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,419
I don't give a
damn about your sponsors.

43
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,173
It was showtime and your asses were nowhere
near that booth, so I did what I had to do!

44
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,341
But, Marvin...

45
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,468
For you it's Mr. Jones, sweetheart...

46
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,179
Besides, he's doing a good job...

47
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,140
He can't... He just can't...

48
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,968
Maybe; but today, he's hosting your show!

49
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
Marvin...

50
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,231
What's that smell?

51
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,525
Marvin, can we at least discuss this?

52
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,447
We could if you didn't
have somewhere to go...

53
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,261
What do you mean? Where are we going?

54
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,535
- District Attorney's office.
- What for?

55
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,987
Press conference about a double homicide.

56
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,998
- Oh come on!
- Just another Monday morning in Chicago...

57
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,084
That's Sullivan's job!

58
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,711
Not today. Today it's yours.

59
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,755
Oh, here you go!

60
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,508
Eww... what is that smell?

61
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,343
Come on, Pilar... Let's go.

62
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,604
Uh oh...

63
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,981
What?

64
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,483
I think we're late again...

65
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,822
What are we gonna do now? I mean, we
can't come back with our hands empty...

66
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,033
- We won't.
- We won't?

67
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,704
- Nah... Call your girl.
- Who?

68
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,789
The forensic girl...

69
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:47,003
Tracy! Of course! She'll
spill the beans for us!

70
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,047
Of course she will. She's crazy about you.

71
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,924
She sure is...

72
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,678
Hey wait... Maybe I
should take a shower first.

73
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,264
Don't worry. She won't notice...

74
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,474
- Are you sure?
- Of course...

75
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,352
She's used to smelling
corpses all day long so...

76
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,187
Shut up!

77
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,149
Something smells funny...

78
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,777
- Does it?
- Yeah... I think it's the cheese...

79
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,111
That could be...

80
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,825
So you were saying it was a double murder?

81
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,870
Yeah. The girl had her
throat slit from ear to ear...

82
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,706
She bled to death. We see that everyday.

83
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,957
Of course...

84
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,671
But the dude... Man! That was a shocker!
His throat was all torn, like chewed up.

85
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,634
He had flesh hanging all over
his neck... It was something else!

86
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,262
- Maybe a dog did it.
- Yeah, or maybe rats...

87
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,425
We'll find out as soon as we get
the lab results, but there's more!

88
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,475
More?

89
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,979
We found tissue under his nails...

90
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,063
From a fight!

91
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,122
Probably!

92
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,983
So you've got the killer's DNA now!

93
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,903
You would think so,
only it was dead tissue...

94
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,654
What do you mean?

95
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,909
Whatever he scratched had
been dead for a very long time.

96
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:06,749
I mean it was rotten flesh.
Stinky dead rotten tissue!

97
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,002
- That's crazy!
- I know, right?

98
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,089
The cheese is fine...

99
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,549
It's good, actually!

100
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,636
Are you eating yours?

101
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,845
Excuse me!

102
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,350
Can I have this to go, please?

103
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:05,910
- Get the fuck out of the car!
- Get out of the car! Get out of the car!

104
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,579
- Get the fuck out of the car!
- Please, don't shoot me!

105
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,555
Oh god, they're coming back!

106
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,211
Marvin, d'you know what time it is?

107
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,462
What?

108
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:47,636
No, no, no, no, no... Don't send Ron, no! We are on
it! Yes, we got this! We'll be on time, I promise.

109
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,889
What happened?

110
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,557
Hurry up, we have to move!

111
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,699
Move where?

112
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,728
Another double murder! There's
a press conference in an hour.

113
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,899
- Does it mean you can take a shower this time?
- I hope so!

114
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,402
Yeah, that makes a bunch of us.

115
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,675
I talked to Tracy. She says one of the
carjackers had his throat ripped off.

116
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,034
Are you kidding me?

117
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,911
Tracy just sent me a text. She says the
Lieutenant is already speaking!- Shit!

118
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,956
Step on the gas, Shelley!

119
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,959
I don't wanna have an
accident; we don't have insurance!

120
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:27,418
The second carjacker was a twenty-year-old male, with four previous arrests
for charges including burglary, child endangerment, and domestic battery.

121
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:36,977
Lieutenant Pulaski, can you comment on the rumor that this was some kind of
street justice by the people who are tired of gun violence and crime in the city?

122
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,971
That's ridiculous, because...

123
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,982
Lieutenant; I'd like to respond to that...

124
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,568
Of course, Madam Mayor...

125
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:59,867
That was an irresponsible question... We need real dialogue that goes beyond just a
discussion about who has the best data but rather expands to a conversation about...

126
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:09,835
how to responsibly use these statistics to drive smart decision-making and the reduction
of violent crime. From our perspective, we want to talk about how to save lives...

127
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,434
reduce violence and eradicate the
socioeconomic factors that contribute to it.

128
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,428
I - I have a question, Mayor...

129
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,478
Yes?

130
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,814
For Doctor Fabrizi...

131
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,481
For me??

132
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,092
Could you confirm or not whether these two
crimes were committed by the same person?

133
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:33,200
What kind of question is that, Franco? Of course they were. They
were killed in the same parking lot within minutes of each other!

134
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:40,666
No, I'm not talking about the two carjackers; I'm talking about this
crime and the photographer and the model that were killed last weekend.

135
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,295
Well, both crimes are under investigation,
so there's no need for speculation.

136
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:52,261
- I'm not speculating; I'm just asking...
- And I'm responding. Nothing indicates these two crimes have anything to do with each other.

137
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,305
Not even the fact that their
necks were all chewed up?

138
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:02,980
That's it! No more questions! A full statement will
be sent to your contact information. Thank you!

139
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,491
I can't... How did they know that??

140
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,703
I know; right?! You guys've
been talking to your wives?

141
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,329
Not me! No, no, no!

142
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,073
You were terrific!

143
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,207
Thank you!

144
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,084
Excuse me, ladies...

145
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,963
- Ladies?
- Yup; she said “ladies”.

146
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,714
Who are you with?

147
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,718
- S.J.N.
- Who?

148
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
“Social Justice Network”?

149
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,099
Social Justice my ass. You
two work for Marvin; don't you?

150
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,101
Oh, you know Marvin!

151
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,481
Yeah. Maybe I should give him a call about
reassigning this story to someone else...

152
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,609
What's the name of that
reporter he usually sends?

153
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,901
Sullivan.

154
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:55,532
Yes, Sullivan. I like Sullivan. He conducts
himself in a very professional manner.

155
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:04,208
Look... These are serious issues and I think Marvin shouldn't
be sending unprepared interns to cover city press conferences.

156
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,959
I agree.

157
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,296
If you'll excuse me... Ladies.

158
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,515
- Ugh... You know what this means!
- Calm down... Deep breath...

159
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,641
It's on!

160
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,509
- It's on!
- I knew it!

161
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,565
We are gonna stay on this story, we are gonna solve this case! We're
gonna catch the killer before the cops do! It's on, you hear me?

162
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,901
- Relax!
- It's on!

163
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:38,283
Intern? Who's is she calling an intern?? I know exactly what
I'm doing! I know exactly where I'm going! It's ON; I mean it!

164
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,582
- Where are the elevators?
- The other way.

165
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,833
It's on!

166
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,755
Lord, have mercy...

167
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:59,429
You are not going to use the airwaves of my radio
station to promote your crazy conspiracy theories!

168
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,573
Now wait a minute, Marvin!

169
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,866
“Airwaves”?
What century is this?

170
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:09,106
Listen, I'm not going to lose my license over some insane leaked
information on a killer biting people's necks! What are your sources?

171
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,527
I can't mention names and get people fired;
you know that! You know how it works!

172
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,405
Exactly! Because I know how it
works, it's my job to set the standards!

173
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,447
Oh, please...

174
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,495
This might be a new concept to you two, but there's
this little thing called “social responsibility”!

175
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,622
With whom? The Mayor?

176
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,350
I'm not even going to respond to that...

177
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,877
Of course not! Hey! Marvin!

178
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:35,090
Do me a favor: get some garlic, a crucifix,
and get the hell out of my station!

179
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,053
Son of a bitch...

180
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,266
Let go, Kolchak. You
need to relax; come on...

181
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,602
Hey, Maxwell...

182
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,979
What's up, Ron?

183
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,400
Is it true that the killer used his
teeth to bite on his victims' throats?

184
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,737
Not only that...

185
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:03,110
He twisted their spines and broke
almost every bone in their bodies...

186
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,328
Oh my god...

187
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,874
I've done two tours in Afghanistan
and never heard of anything like this...

188
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:16,206
There was blood... Flesh...
Organs all over the crime scenes...

189
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,925
Oh Jesus...

190
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,052
On top of that...

191
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,141
You should've seen your face, Sullivan!

192
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,184
That wasn't funny!

193
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,060
I bet your shitted in your Hanes!

194
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,520
It's not funny at all!

195
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,731
How did she know my brand?

196
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,070
What?!

197
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,114
You have another call.
It's the Mayor's office.

198
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,281
Again??

199
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,792
I wonder if he's gonna
kill again tonight...

200
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,129
What makes you so sure it's a “he”?

201
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,840
It's got to be. He's too sloppy.

202
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,926
I'm sloppy.

203
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:05,305
No, you're not. You're dedicated;
and your followers love that.

204
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,265
I don't know...

205
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,351
Speaking of followers,
how many views so far?

206
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,310
None.

207
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,887
I haven't posted yet.

208
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,231
You haven't? Why not?

209
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,317
What are you waiting
for? Marvin's “airwaves”?

210
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,603
I can't believe he said that.

211
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:24,241
The man is stuck in the eighties! We
are influencers! We control the message!

212
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,285
Until we get canceled...

213
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,495
Then we look for new platforms!

214
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,621
I guess you're right.

215
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,959
Of course I am! Go ahead, hit post!

216
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,587
Posted!

217
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,590
That's my girl! Now we need to celebrate.

218
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,759
How did you call it?

219
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:48,598
“Night Hunt - Blood thirsty killer
roams the streets of Chicago”

220
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,393
Damn, that's aggressive!

221
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,178
I thought you liked it!

222
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,189
I do, I love it!

223
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,983
Really love it!

224
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,444
This is good. It's gonna make me tipsy.

225
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,188
That's the plan.

226
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,773
Are you trying to seduce me?

227
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,950
Maybe; why?

228
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,994
It's working.

229
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,407
Don't pick up.

230
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,083
At least let me see who it is...

231
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,629
It's probably Marvin firing
us after reading your blog.

232
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,298
Hi Tracy.

233
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,675
I read your blog.

234
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,260
Did I get you in trouble?

235
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:31,433
No, that's not why I'm calling. Listen... we've got
some new evidence. The lab's results are back...

236
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:39,850
The DNA found on the carjackers and the photographer match,
so it's conclusive they were killed by the same person.

237
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,019
Good! So my report is accurate.

238
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,146
- Well... Not really.
- Why not?

239
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:50,994
The model was killed with a knife. The detectives now think she
was killed by the photographer, and I would agree with that.

240
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,371
That's interesting...

241
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,581
I'm interesting...

242
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:01,496
So now that the photographer changed from victim to
suspect... his studio is much more than a crime scene...

243
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,216
That's exactly what they
said at meeting this evening.

244
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,669
How long do you think we have before
the cops turn that place upside down?

245
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,680
I would say until tomorrow
morning at the latest.

246
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,551
Thank you, Tracy. You're the best!

247
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,603
I am the best...

248
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,814
Hold it; one more thing...

249
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,068
The saliva found on the
victims' throats is human.

250
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,820
Human??

251
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,865
Yes, no dogs, no rats;
human. Human and dead.

252
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,535
You mentioned the tissue before...

253
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:39,701
Whatever it was that they scratched or got bitten by... was dead. I mean long-time dead.
And that DNA doesn't match anything in our files, so this is gonna take a while...

254
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,131
Jesus...

255
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,260
Listen, I gotta go now. Good luck tonight!

256
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,472
Well?

257
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,975
- Get dressed.
- Get dressed?

258
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,435
We're going out.

259
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,869
Such a beautiful
night... to get arrested.

260
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,119
Or killed!

261
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,955
I thought the killer was dead.

262
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,917
The photographer is dead. And, according to
Tracy, the guy who killed him is “deader”.

263
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,461
- “Deader”?
- Aha!

264
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,242
- So we have nothing to worry about!
- What are you doing?

265
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,550
- We're gonna be seen from outside!
- How are we going to see inside?

266
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,594
Hold on...

267
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,349
- Oh!
- See? Night vision!

268
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,936
- Smart girl!
- Hmmm Genius!

269
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,384
He was a good photographer.

270
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,063
Meh... the models are hot, though.

271
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,028
What do you think happened here?

272
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,990
Everything? A ritual?

273
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,493
What kind of ritual?

274
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,120
The kind where they bleed people to death?

275
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,792
It happens in churches all around
the country. They call it “donations”.

276
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,586
Look over there!

277
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,009
This is weird...

278
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,303
Is that the photographer?

279
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,722
I don't think so...

280
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,849
The “deader guy”?

281
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,927
What'you doing?

282
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,979
Sorry, but I need to see more.

283
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,941
Alright, here we go. I hope
Marvin can bail our asses out of jail.

284
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,111
Look... Here's our photographer.

285
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,072
What the hell happened here?

286
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,741
Let's...

287
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,412
Let's compose this...

288
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,329
Uh oh...

289
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:27,002
First, the photographer kills the model
in some kind of satanic ritual right here.

290
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,628
Okay, that's the easy part.

291
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:29,671
Third...

292
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,840
Wait, wait... You are skipping “second”.

293
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,090
Bare with me.

294
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,843
Okay, Sherlock...

295
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,755
Third, the photographer
gets killed right here by...

296
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,099
- The “deader” guy!
- Correct.

297
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,476
And where did the “deader” guy come from?

298
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,269
That's...

299
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,897
See? That I have no clue.

300
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,774
And that's number two.

301
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,401
That's number two...

302
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,404
Something happened right here...

303
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,073
after a ritual over there...

304
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,994
that resulted in a son of a bitch
getting chewed up to death over there...

305
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,892
and I have no idea what it
was. And it's driving me crazy!

306
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,416
I know...

307
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,085
Who is the deader guy?

308
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,089
What are these prints?
Where did he come from?

309
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,508
Transylvania?

310
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,639
That little box?

311
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:27,354
Look... This seems to be a big-ass
“deader” guy, and that's a tiny-ass box.

312
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,940
- It's not a box; it's an urn.
- A what?

313
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,612
An urn. Like the ones they use to put
“deader” guys in when they're still ashes?

314
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,607
Still ashes, huh?

315
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,661
Yeah, you know how it works...
You've seen the movies too; haven't you?

316
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,038
I'm afraid I have...

317
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:53,246
Number one: devil worshiper crazy-ass photographer kills
one of his models and collects her blood in a cup.

318
00:27:54,422 --> 00:28:02,422
Number two: Dracula-fan son of a bitch photographer mixes dead model's
blood with “deader” guy's ashes and wakes him up from the grave.

319
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:14,768
And number three: Deader guy woke up moody and hungry and, instead of rewarding his
ass with eternal life, he decides to have a shit-head photographer for dinner.

320
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,912
I rest my case.

321
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,792
- Bravo! You should be a writer.
- I am.

322
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,380
Cool, Hemingway; you've got your story.
Can we go home now? It's getting creepy.

323
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:39,759
Not yet. I've got my story,
but I need some visuals.

324
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,803
Hey, that's my job!

325
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,347
I'll record some video too.

326
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,681
We need to find out
anything we can about this guy.

327
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,516
Dead or Deader?

328
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,319
Dead. The photographer. He's
the key to find the other one.

329
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,783
- Where's Porto Alegre?
- Who?

330
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,578
Porto Alegre. Portugal?

331
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,831
Don't look at me. I got lost in Indiana.

332
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,417
And Colonia del Sacramento?

333
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,910
California!

334
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,921
No; not Sacramento. Colonia del Sacramento.

335
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,424
Hum... Baja California?

336
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,012
Uruguay! At least the
money is from Uruguay.

337
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,557
Okay, I think I'm done. Can we go now?

338
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,644
- Take some pictures of these papers and we can go.
- Okay.

339
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,983
It's easier to look at pictures
later than to read in the dark now.

340
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,821
You're right... It's getting
creepy here. Let's go.

341
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,870
You don't seriously
believe any of this shit; do you?

342
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,197
- What do you mean?
- Vampires.

343
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,667
I believe anything and everything
first, and then I desbelieve later.

344
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,920
That's not very scientific; is it?

345
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,715
On the contrary: science is
constant doubt and it is never settled.

346
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,011
At this rate, we'll end up
writing for the QAnon Digest.

347
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,939
I wonder is he's out
there tonight... Hunting.

348
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,069
I hope not...

349
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,992
If he is, people need to know.

350
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,869
You can't save the world, Pilar.

351
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,082
By myself maybe not, but you
and I together? We got this!

352
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,459
Lord have mercy...

353
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:02,735
Man, this is bullshit! I don't understand why I can't
take her with me. She's not a suspect; is she?

354
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:08,324
Of course not, Mr. Stevens; but she's a witness
to a violent crime, and she could be in danger.

355
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,494
We can take care of my
sister way better than y'all can!

356
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,446
You know, even if that was true...

357
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,457
It is true! We don't need no cops!

358
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,867
Officer Pulaski!

359
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,436
- That's Lieutenant...
- Man, whatever!

360
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,839
And you need to go talk to her!
Your sister isn't ready to go yet.

361
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,342
Yeah? We'll see about that! Sandra!

362
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,679
Where's my sister at, man? Sandra!

363
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,099
I'll have the nurse bring
your medication, okay?

364
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,476
- For what?
- It will help you sleep tonight.

365
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,397
- I don't wanna sleep.
- I know, but you really need to.

366
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,233
Doctor Kahn...

367
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,442
Yes?

368
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,656
You do believe me, right?

369
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,160
I believe that you need to get some sleep.

370
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,459
Yes?

371
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,626
- Miss Stevens, I believe your brother is here...
- Get out of the way, man!

372
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,712
T.J.!

373
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,928
- Oh god!
- It's okay, sis... It's okay. I'm here.

374
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,014
- I got you! You alright?
- Yeah...

375
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,684
- Let them have a few minutes.
- Thank you.

376
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:57,493
Sister, you sure about this? You know me and my boys can
protect you better than the whole police department.

377
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,622
Yeah, T.J. I know you can! I just...

378
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,459
- I feel like I need to stay here...
- Why?

379
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,670
Because I want to help.

380
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,175
- If anything happens, you call me...
- Yeah...

381
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,218
- I'll be right back!
- Okay!

382
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,824
Oh shit...

383
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,452
I knew I forgot something...

384
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,831
I forgot something.

385
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,625
Now what?

386
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:50,630
Sis, I almost forgot... Momma...
she wants me to give you this...

387
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,798
- Give me what?
- Hold on...

388
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,052
- What is this?
- Look, she wanted me to give you this...

389
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,056
Alright... She says Jesus will protect
you. You know how momma is...

390
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:05,853
Yes, I know how momma is. And she
also knows I'm not a religious person...

391
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:10,566
Listen, just wear it, take a selfie and
send it to her. It'll make her happy, okay?

392
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,151
- Yeah, okay...
- Alright...

393
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,295
- I guess...
- That's all you gotta do.

394
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,403
Bye... Thank you

395
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,239
- Call me!
- Aha...

396
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,661
Hey man, you'd better
get your ass off that phone!

397
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,540
Something happens to my sister,
I'ma come back and kick your ass...

398
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,043
- Go home...
- Toy Cop...

399
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,018
Can I help you?

400
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,814
T.J.?

401
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,326
Oh my god... Oh my god!

402
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,753
T.J.!

403
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,577
- Where the hell did those shots come from?
- I think this way!

404
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,601
Let's go!

405
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,907
No!

406
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,621
No! No!!

407
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,385
No!

408
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,974
What the hell was that?

409
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,400
Two men down, two men down!

410
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,123
- No, no, no!
- Calm down, please!

411
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,254
Where did he go? Where
did he go? Where did he go?

412
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,884
Where did he go? Where
did he go? Where did he go?

413
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,475
Chicago has a new enemy...

414
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,109
As in other large cities in this country, Chicagoans
have learned to live with big challenges...

415
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,238
I told you I got you...

416
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:10,997
We have become accustomed to dealing with violence,
marginalization, racial tension, viruses, and lockdowns.

417
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:20,006
We are strong and resilient.
It seems that nothing can beat us.

418
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:26,637
We always find a way to overcome
adversity and move on with our lives.

419
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:43,696
However... very occasionally...
there are challenges that defy all logic.

420
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:59,628
The lessons of history that prepare us to adapt
to everything, or almost everything, fail us.

421
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,857
Suddenly, we
find ourselves unprotected...

422
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:13,277
confused, and scared. Against all reason, we are left to cling to old
forgotten forms of defense that we had already purposely disposed of.

423
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:20,418
Science is not enough and superstition becomes
the light at the end of the tunnel...

424
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,507
I'm Pilar Franco, and this is “The Hammer”.

425
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,808
Well, I'm glad you didn't
mention the “V” word.

426
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,433
Well, you told us you
would fire us if we did, so...

427
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,187
Yeah, that's quite an incentive, Marvin. Have
you considered a career in Human Resources?

428
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:47,611
I'm not firing your asses; at least not today. Not until
you... What's the word? “Engage” with your followers.

429
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:54,076
- Wow... I'm impressed, Marvin!
- Yeah, that's influencer talk 101!

430
00:40:55,077 --> 00:41:02,084
Okay, influencers, respond to your e-mails! You've got hundreds
of them. Our live-chat is on fire as well as our hot-lines.

431
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,464
“Hot-lines”? See that...
That's last century shit.

432
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,716
Yeah, you were doing just fine until now.

433
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,970
Enough of that! We're losing
revenue by the minute. Now, move!

434
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,519
Oh, Marvin, I wanted to talk to you
about some ideas I have for engagement...

435
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,314
Ron... I'm a married man.

436
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,195
Not even my type...

437
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,872
T.J., where are we?

438
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,749
Nicole's house.

439
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,710
Nicole's house? Why?

440
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,838
You said you'd be taking me home!

441
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,342
Look... Calm down. We can't go home.

442
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,426
Why not??

443
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,053
Sis, please!

444
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,888
Trust me, okay?

445
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,016
I know what I'm doing. I know how to hide.

446
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,685
- But T.J...
- Sandra, look...

447
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,065
If that son of a bitch decides to come
back around, I'm gonna be ready for him...

448
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,859
Okay? and it can get nasty...

449
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,862
- You know what I mean?
- Exactly, which is why we...

450
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,741
We don't want momma
to see that now... do we?

451
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,164
I guess not.

452
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,041
Alright...

453
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,126
Trust me...

454
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,003
You'll be safe here.

455
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,846
They let her go??

456
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,808
Yeah, her brother took her
home this morning... I think.

457
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,768
Can you try to find out where she lives?

458
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,103
I can try.

459
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,273
I can't believe they would
let her go! She's in danger!

460
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:52,570
I don't blame them after last night. Gee, I'm
glad I'm working the morning shift this week!

461
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,490
Sandra Stevens should be in a police
station surrounded by armed cops.

462
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:02,580
Armed? Armed with what? Wooden crosses
and stakes? Bullets didn't do much...

463
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,074
Oh my god, we got
653 e-mails in the last 24 hours!

464
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:44,163
When Marvin said the chat was on fire I didn't
know he meant California state-wide wildfire!

465
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,333
Engagement is the
dream of all influencers...

466
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,335
I don't know where to start!

467
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,672
Organize them by sender and start
with the ones who sent more messages.

468
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,925
Good idea. What would I do without you?

469
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,889
- Where's Crowley?
- Who?

470
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:08,262
Porto Alegre is in Brazil. Colonia del Sacramento
is in Uruguay; NOT in Baja California...

471
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,222
Okay, that was a wild guess...

472
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:13,233
And now I found a note that says “Crowley”.

473
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,612
Hey, I thought you were going
to respond to messages too!

474
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,156
I'll do that later; this is important.

475
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,242
How do you spell “Crowley”?

476
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,952
Never mind; I found it.

477
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,038
You're fast with Google!

478
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,790
I never use Google.

479
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:35,956
Here it says that there are 6 cities named Crowley and they're all here in the
US. They're in Texas, Oregon, Louisiana, Colorado, California and Arkansas.

480
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,717
Baja California?

481
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,054
Maybe it's not a place;
maybe it's a person.

482
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:49,186
Speaking of persons, we have a total winner here.
This girl sent fifty four e-mails this morning only!

483
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,980
That's the definition of “follower”.

484
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:57,403
More like a cult-follower. And many of
them are voice-messages. Should I play one?

485
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,397
Why not? I'm not making
much progress here anyway...

486
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,615
Here you go...

487
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,831
What the hell?

488
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,917
Sounds like someone speaking
Spanish with a broken jaw!

489
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,545
Not the Spanish I know. What's her name?

490
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,340
She signs “Lady Trotsky”. Must be Russian!

491
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,218
That's not Russian. Let me look her up...

492
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,045
Here's another one...

493
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,675
Did she say “Crowley”?

494
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,686
I don't know. I don't understand
one word of what she's saying.

495
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:36,734
Listen to this: Lady Trotsky a.k.a Renata Cezimbra
is a Brazilian writer from Porto Alegre...

496
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,394
Porto Alegre?

497
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:46,444
Listen: Cezimbra has published several novels and articles about vampirism claiming they're based
on historical facts. Most of her stories originate from local folklore from Buenos Aires...

498
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,288
- Uruguay!
- No, that's Argentina...

499
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,040
I told you I got lost in Indiana.

500
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,836
And Montevideo; now that's Uruguay.

501
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,705
Do you think she knew the photographer?

502
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,966
- She knows something and we have to get in touch with her.
- I'm on it.

503
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,043
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

504
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,054
- To the studio. I wanna try something.
- Do you need help?

505
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:12,561
No. Try to get Lady Trotsky on zoom or skype or
anything where we can record her. I'll be right back.

506
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:40,255
Now you see why I wanted to bring you here,
sis. I know the cops didn't have this set-up!

507
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,301
I guess not.

508
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:53,302
You don't even have to be right here to see it. I'm gonna send you a link and all you have to do
is look at your phone and you can see the cameras wherever you are! You don't even need an app!

509
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,523
Yeah, T.J... it's real cool...

510
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,861
Because if that son of a bitch shows up here
and we see him... we'll be ready for him!

511
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:11,745
- So you guys did all this for me?
- Not really... Nicole already had these cameras set up.

512
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,408
Why would Nicole need so many cameras?

513
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,501
Don't even ask...

514
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,754
Hey, Sandra... They're talking about you.

515
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:31,348
If you are watching this, please get in touch with me. My direct contact information
is on the live chat; please call me. I have information that can save your life...

516
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,682
She's lying!

517
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,804
I will not disclose your location, I
don't even need to know where you are...

518
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,522
Sounds sincere to me...

519
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,359
Thanks, Nicole.

520
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,902
Sure!

521
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,741
I don't know, T.J...
Maybe I should call her.

522
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,159
That's a bad idea!

523
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,720
But she says she wants to help.

524
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,621
She's lying through her teeth!

525
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,249
You're just a story to her!

526
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:05,749
Look, she will do exactly the opposite to what she said she wouldn't
do! She will expose our location! You can't trust the media!

527
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,765
Well, that was different...

528
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,392
I hope it works.

529
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,770
He will kill her, Shelley;
we both know that.

530
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,274
What the hell was that? Sending
private messages through my airwaves?

531
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,443
- The “airwaves” again...
- Marvin...

532
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,070
What is this? A Radio
Public Message Board??

533
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,738
- Marvin...
- What??

534
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:34,620
- What??
- Hi... You've got another phone call from the Mayor's Office... The sound pretty pissed...

535
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,663
Jesus...

536
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:45,455
I should have bought that farm in Wisconsin, but no, Marvin...
you had to spend your stimulus check on a radio station!

537
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,091
I could have been a farmer... in Wisconsin!

538
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,510
He would have made a good farmer.

539
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,421
Did you get in touch with Lady Trotksy?

540
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,223
- Yeah, she replied right away...
- I knew she would...

541
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,352
I have the chat open.
I'm just waiting for her.

542
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,330
Why are you running it through PowerPoint?

543
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:07,027
It's a hack I found on Reddit. It will solve our language barrier
problem. We'll have automatic translation captions; how about that?

544
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,905
- I thought Zoom had interpreters.
- They do, but...

545
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,658
Do we really want someone
else to listen to this conversation?

546
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,535
You mean other than Gates and Zuckerberg?

547
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,912
Oh, I think she's on!

548
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,197
Hi! How are you?

549
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,667
Oh, maybe we won't need any of this!

550
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,711
Hi Renata; that's your name; right?

551
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:29,925
Yes, Renata. Si... Yes... My name.

552
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,843
Can you speak English?

553
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,308
It works!

554
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,228
Don't worry! Can you understand English?

555
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,236
- Perfect!
- This is gonna work!

556
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:53,198
Renata, why did you get in touch with
us? Why did you write all those e-mails?

557
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,080
- Andrew Craig?
- The photographer...

558
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,499
Did you know Andrew Craig?

559
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,770
Did you mention Crowley
when you reached out to her?

560
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,941
Not at all. And we haven't
published those pictures either.

561
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,112
Renata... Who is Crowley?

562
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,411
Did you say 1600s?

563
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,673
So where does Andrew Craig fit in all this?

564
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,096
What did Andrew Craig want?

565
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,102
- It all makes sense now...
- Yeah...

566
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,205
I think we got everything we needed.

567
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:29,044
Renata, thank you so much! You're awesome!
You've helped us more than you'll ever know!

568
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,592
There's someone else trying to join us...

569
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,097
Who's Janet?

570
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,722
Let her in...

571
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,728
Met who? Craig?

572
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:52,983
“Hola”...

573
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,822
Only for you, Renata!

574
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,033
Excuse me...

575
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,579
Uh oh... language... translation!

576
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,991
Is it gonna work in two languages
at the same time? I mean three??

577
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,544
I don't know. I'm hacking
my way through this...

578
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,047
I speak English... A little “few”...

579
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:22,297
- Oh my god... I...
- I love your work!

580
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,559
You are very nice, thank you!

581
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,019
I didn't know... I didn't think...

582
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:35,610
I never write about Crowley and what happened back
in the 80s... I've never done it and I never will...

583
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,697
I leave that to Renata.

584
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,578
I've spent the last thirty
years trying to forget him...

585
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,511
But... I always knew this day was coming.

586
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,292
I'm not sure we are talking
about the same Crowley

587
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,377
There is only one.

588
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:56,965
Well, you certainly look gorgeous for
someone who's been around since the 1600s!

589
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,969
This is mi amiga Shelley. I do the
writing and she takes the pictures.

590
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:08,185
You two remind me of my friend Pato and I when
we were young. She was also a photographer.

591
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,396
A very good photographer.

592
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,983
What happened to her?

593
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,612
Crowley...

594
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,282
Pato and I were following him close...

595
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,035
Maybe too close...

596
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,371
And she paid the price with her life...

597
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:36,504
He almost killed me too, but
the... The sunrise beat him.

598
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,258
He didn't make it on time to his grave...

599
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,054
And the sunrise... the rays...

600
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:49,309
burned his flesh and his bones.

601
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,480
I saw him become ashes
right in front of my eyes!

602
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,108
And those ashes are the ones
that Andrew Craig brought here...

603
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:03,448
No... The ashes went to the bottom
of the river; I throw them myself.

604
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,734
But then how...?

605
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:12,832
In the last five years, we have... How do
you say? When the water comes down...

606
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,618
The tide?

607
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:22,668
When the river dries up, miles and miles of... land? appear. And people
from all over come looking for gold coins or other stuff in the sand.

608
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,014
Treasure hunters.

609
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,474
Yes.

610
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:35,146
Someone came looking for a
treasure but found a curse...

611
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,316
And now you have the curse.

612
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,570
Yes, but... thanks to you, we
are going to break this curse.

613
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,948
Yes, we're gonna beat his ass!

614
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,203
I think you need to be very careful...

615
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,290
Crowley is...

616
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,333
evil.

617
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,586
And... He won't stop.

618
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,131
You beat him once.

619
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,550
I was lucky...

620
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:08,305
And you will need to be lucky too.

621
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,819
I don't... I don't recognize this number...

622
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,280
Hello?

623
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,198
Hello?

624
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,742
Hi...

625
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,412
Is this the radio station?

626
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,249
This is Pilar Franco. Is
this... Sandra Stevens?

627
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,754
Yes... How did you know I would call?

628
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,507
I've been told I'm overly confident.

629
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,052
That makes two of us.

630
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,512
Not tonight, though.

631
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,723
I know what you mean.

632
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,226
Listen, I'm not being
recorded or anything, am I?

633
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,437
No, of course not.

634
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:02,150
And you don't have me going
live on the radio or anything, right?

635
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,644
No; it's just us talking.

636
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,694
Good...

637
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,075
Because if my brother knows that I
was talking to you, he would be pissed...

638
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,285
That's why I'm whispering here...

639
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,702
I understand...

640
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,024
- What happened with Betty last night, man?
- I'll tell you what happened with Betty...

641
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,176
I was with Betty and
her sister came by too...

642
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,479
Hey man, what the hell are you all doing?

643
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,317
T.J... it's cold outside.

644
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,819
You got this big fire,
man; we're gonna be seen!

645
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,322
Go check on Sandra. We got this...

646
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,408
Stupid!

647
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,120
Then he was like walking
in circles... He was furious!

648
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,748
But he also seemed
scared at the same time...

649
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,959
Was it there a crucifix on the wall?

650
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:02,643
No...

651
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,671
Did you have a cross on you?

652
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:09,259
Yeah, I did! I had a
crucifix with me... Why?

653
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,344
Do you still have it??

654
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:15,056
Hum... I think it's around
here somewhere... Why?

655
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,106
Keep talking...

656
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,387
I'm sorry if this all sounds
crazy and too far out...

657
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,434
Nothing sounds crazy or too far out...

658
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,146
Especially if you'd seen
the things that I've seen...

659
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,064
His eyes...

660
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,153
Are you safe? Do you
have enough protection.

661
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,490
Oh, I have a lot of protection...

662
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,743
But I don't feel safe.

663
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,579
Find the cross and...

664
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,291
Call me any time... I'll be up all night.

665
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,751
Okay...

666
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,670
Thank you.

667
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,682
Hey...

668
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,228
We are doing everything we can.

669
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,689
She sounds like such a
good person; you know?

670
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,900
And I'm sure she is...

671
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:54,405
We'll have a chance to meet her and... go
for a cup of coffee when this is all over.

672
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,572
God... I hope you're not another one...

673
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,119
What's wrong with that dog?

674
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,420
- Maybe it's seeing something.
- No, that crazy dog barks all night.

675
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,754
I wish it stopped barking

676
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,548
Maybe it needs to get laid...

677
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,508
It's getting on my nerves!

678
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,218
Maybe you need to get laid.

679
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,304
It's gonna keep on barking, man!

680
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,729
Did y'all hear that?

681
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,231
Seems like the owner finally had enough...

682
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,693
The owner works nights...

683
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,738
That's why the dog barks all night long.

684
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,537
What?

685
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,998
Where the hell are they going?

686
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:45,808
Sandra?

687
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:46,976
Are you alright?

688
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,518
Is everything okay?

689
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,897
Yes... I think so.

690
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:55,777
You said I could call at any
time... I hope you don't mind.

691
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,695
Of course, I asked you to do this.

692
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,906
Are you okay?

693
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,743
Yeah... I think so...

694
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,871
Everything is weird...

695
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,041
What do you mean? Where are you?

696
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,380
I'm in a room
looking at all these screens...

697
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,590
What screens?

698
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,217
Hold on...

699
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,182
This is serious!

700
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,518
She just sent us a link.

701
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,645
To what?

702
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,606
To everything.

703
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,817
Did you get it?

704
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,069
Yes, but I don't see you.

705
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,363
Yes... There are no cameras here.

706
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,906
Did they leave you alone??

707
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,157
Yeah...

708
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,366
Why??

709
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:50,623
What's going on?

710
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:51,873
I don't know.

711
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,044
Sandra!

712
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,133
Sandra, what's going on??

713
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,415
I don't know... I don't know...

714
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,167
I don't know... I don't know...

715
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,105
Run!

716
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:18,895
Sandra, stay there!

717
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,228
T.J.!

718
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,904
Sandra, you need to get out of there!

719
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,144
Shelley, we need to call the cops!

720
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,746
Pilar, we don't know where this is!

721
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,335
I don't see him!

722
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,212
Sandra, he's in the house!!

723
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,974
Nicole!!

724
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:53,936
Nicole!!

725
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,441
Where is he? Where is he??

726
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,819
Run! Run hide!!

727
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:12,538
Sandra!

728
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,248
Come on! Quick, come on!

729
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,665
Be quiet!

730
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,207
Wait... wait here... wait!

731
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,258
Get out!!

732
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:30,515
Sandra... wait... wait here...

733
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,059
I'll be right back...

734
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:38,689
Die!

735
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,941
Die motherfucker!

736
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,024
T.J.!!

737
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,527
God! Be careful!

738
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,915
Sandra watch out!!

739
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,464
- Run!
- No!

740
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:27,445
No!

741
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,569
I thought you two could use this.

742
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,245
Did you put anything in it?

743
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,247
Only the good stuff.

744
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,125
Thank you, Tracy. You're an angel.

745
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,253
Speaking of angels... He's on his way now.

746
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:28,090
He's been talking to the Mayor
for an hour and he's pissed!

747
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,302
Just another day in the life
of Lieutenant Pulaski, I guess.

748
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,054
Good luck, girls.

749
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,681
What the hell are you doing here?

750
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,182
Coffee.

751
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,435
Get back to your lab.

752
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,062
Yes, Mi Lord...

753
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,986
So you didn't record any faces...

754
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:54,283
No. As we already told you, we
didn't have permission to record.

755
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,077
What about the security cameras?

756
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,662
Same answer.

757
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,748
Honest reporters, huh? What a concept...

758
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,835
Did you check with the cell-phone company? I'm
sure they record everything all the time, anyway.

759
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:08,381
Yeah, we did and all we got was blurry video
of a bunch of guys shooting at each other.

760
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:09,757
What?

761
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,968
Same with the CCTV cameras.

762
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,095
Maybe he can't be photographed...

763
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,763
Like with mirrors...

764
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,432
Here we go again...

765
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,851
Listen Lieutenant, we know what we saw!

766
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,186
Yeah, I wish you did!

767
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:26,691
We do! And so do you!
At the hospital; remember?

768
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,998
I have no idea what you're talking about.

769
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,444
Oh, Jesus...

770
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,363
All this crazy talk needs to stop!

771
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,698
Because the Mayor says so?

772
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,449
No, because I say so!

773
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:39,328
What's wrong, Lieutenant? Are you and
the Mayor afraid of looking incompetent?

774
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,913
Don't push me, Franco.

775
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,935
A bunch of unresolved murders should be just another
day for the Cook County State's Attorney's office!

776
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:45,959
Enough!

777
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,602
You don't know what you're dealing with.

778
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,672
Actually, we do; and we have a suspect.

779
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:50,881
- Do you?
- Who?

780
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,818
I'm not going to discuss that with you two.

781
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,843
Of course!

782
01:06:54,176 --> 01:07:00,307
It'll be released today on a press conference. So stay low and
stay out of this investigation or I'll throw your asses in jail!

783
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:01,759
You can't arrest us!

784
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:02,927
I can and I will.

785
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,020
On what charges??

786
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,983
Obstruction of Justice and that's
an easy one. Just don't make me.

787
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,268
Can we go now?

788
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:12,945
Yeah, not soon enough!

789
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:30,796
You know, you can always close
your eyes, but you can't close your ears...

790
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,589
What?

791
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:37,344
- For as long as I live, I think I'll always remember the sounds that she made...
- Stop it...

792
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,765
Gasping for air while
she was being strangled...

793
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,602
Pilar, stop it! There was
nothing we could have done!

794
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,596
Maybe. Maybe not.

795
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,148
There was nothing...

796
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,193
- Maybe the cops knew where she was...
- Stop...

797
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,279
And all we had to do
was pick up the phone!

798
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,156
Maybe we should leave the city.

799
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,452
I'm sure he saw us.

800
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,996
I don't wanna run.

801
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,128
- Okay then, let's go shopping.
- What?

802
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,842
- I don't know about this one.
- Why not? It's Holy Water.

803
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,253
What if it's not? What
if it's just tap water?

804
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:22,264
That lady from the Botánica said
it was Holy Water and I believe her.

805
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,641
Do we wanna risk it?

806
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,760
Ouch! Shit!!

807
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,895
- And what is this??
- It's Christ Thorns.

808
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,248
What are we supposed to
do with it? Prick him to death?

809
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,358
I read it can bleed a vampire to death!

810
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,736
- This is stupid!
- Well, you didn't wanna leave the city!

811
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,648
How close do we need to get to use any of
this?? Did you see what he did to those guys??

812
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,234
I'm sorry, but they had just ran
out of wooden stake cannons!

813
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:46,705
And speaking of wooden stakes, we need
to make them. There's a knife on the table.

814
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,077
This is bullshit! He's gonna tear us
apart before we can even find his chest!

815
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,337
Do you have any better suggestions?!

816
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,057
Unknown. Let me screen this.

817
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,729
My name
is Rachel Stone. I'm an attorney.

818
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:11,564
Scam.

819
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:17,653
I represent Mr. Virgil Salcedo. My client would like
to discuss matters related to the late Andrew Craig...

820
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,313
Craig!

821
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:23,993
Please, give me a call back at your earliest convenience.
This is a fairly urgent matter. Thank you...

822
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,913
Hi... Yes...

823
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,624
This is Pilar Franco...

824
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,625
When and where?

825
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:54,732
I am the suspect that will be announced during
a press conference later this evening...

826
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,031
But as you know...

827
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,200
I am not the killer.

828
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,245
So why are they pinning this on you?

829
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:16,170
Let's just say that I'm not in good terms with the city... And my association
with Andrew Craig presented as the perfect opportunity to get rid of me.

830
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,190
Why aren't you in good terms with the city?

831
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,040
That's not part of this conversation...

832
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,801
Rachel... Let me handle this, please...

833
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:31,018
My beef with the city has to do with
politics, money, contracts... Not murder.

834
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:36,607
They want an enemy out of the picture and they need a scapegoat
for their incompetence, and you're looking at both right now.

835
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:41,195
- Mr. Salcedo... I still don't see...
- Please, please... let me just finish...

836
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:45,983
In about an hour I will turn myself in...

837
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,994
That's just the start of
the mediation process...

838
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:54,833
Rachel likes fancy legal terms, but the fact is that I'm
gonna get my ass handed for something I did not do.

839
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,544
The D.A. and the Mayor
will declare victory...

840
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,924
And after tonight, you two will be
the only ones looking for the real killer.

841
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,136
That includes the media. They're
not interested. I already asked.

842
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:12,142
- I bet you did.
- Yes, I did. I need you. I need the narrative.

843
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:15,854
We don't do “narratives”.

844
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,899
I need you to find the killer.

845
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,464
I haven't heard anything that
will get us any closer to that.

846
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,112
I can be generous.

847
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,738
Generous?

848
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:29,910
How old are you? Twenty six, twenty eight? I bet
you're drowning in student debt. I can help with that.

849
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,620
How about you?

850
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,740
The army paid for my
education. I don't owe a cent.

851
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,792
But I bet you don't own a cent either.

852
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,254
We are wasting our time here...

853
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:47,386
Andrew Craig hired me to find him several properties for
the past few years. Some here, some in South America.

854
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:53,892
More precisely, he was interested in buying a house in
Uruguay, in a small city called Colonia del Sacramento.

855
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:58,564
Go on...

856
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,985
He also asked me to find
him a building here in the city.

857
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:11,485
Something that had been abandoned for a long time, something
rundown, dark, and isolated with no next-door neighbors.

858
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,705
- Did you find it?
- Oh yes, I did...

859
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:19,293
And I sold it to him for an insane
amount of money. He didn't blink an eye.

860
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:28,711
On closing day, we went out to celebrate. Got a
couple of drinks. He got tipsy and spilled the beans.

861
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,515
He told me he'd bought it for his Master.

862
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,559
His Master?

863
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,937
If you ask me, I think he meant the Devil.

864
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,523
Close enough. Do you have an address?

865
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,275
I can do better than that...

866
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,319
I've got the keys.

867
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:19,311
What if Salcedo is part of this just
like Craig was? What if this is a trap?

868
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:27,111
We are under attack and people are dying. We can either
lockdown and hide or go out and fight. What will it be?

869
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,490
You know I can fight.

870
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,045
I know you don't
like to talk about the war...

871
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,881
Have you ever killed anyone?

872
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,804
Let's go.

873
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,417
I can't believe this...
He's not in this building.

874
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:56,713
Why would he lie? Why would Salcedo lie?

875
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,633
Maybe he didn't; I don't know.

876
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:02,210
I think we should get out
of here before it gets dark.

877
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,264
Yeah; maybe it's a trap. Let's go.

878
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,274
Pilar... What'you doing?

879
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,568
These windows have newspaper!

880
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,405
- So?
- Why would they do that?

881
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:24,116
I don't know... Paint job?

882
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:27,411
To prevent sunlight from coming in!

883
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,580
Or... to paint the interior
without messing up the windows...

884
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:34,793
There's nothing to see! Can we go now?

885
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,671
Clearly nobody's been here for years!

886
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:41,466
- I would agree, but...
- But what?

887
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,470
This edition is from two weeks ago.

888
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,109
Pilar!

889
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,081
Pilar!!

890
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,616
No!!

891
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,793
Nooo!!

892
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:38,179
For as long as I live, I think I'll
always remember the sounds that she made...

893
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:40,974
You can't save the world, Pilar...

894
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,170
No!

895
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,090
No!

896
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:58,510
No!

897
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,971
Pilar! Pilar!!

898
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:06,267
Wake up! Pilar! No!

899
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,603
No!!!

900
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:15,485
No! Take me! Take me,
motherfucker!! Take me!!!

901
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,840
Are you okay?

902
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:22,820
This morning, we woke up to the news that Virgil
Salcedo hanged himself before he was arrested.

903
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,114
Or was it afterward?

904
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:31,162
It doesn't really matter. We've all seen the memes and
popular wisdom indicates that they never hang themselves...

905
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:35,416
With Salcedo's death, the
official story is now fully confirmed:

906
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:42,882
After a week of terror, a dangerous criminal was identified and
took his own life before he was apprehended by our city heroes...

907
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:49,973
By the time you hear this story, you will be confronted
by two completely different versions of the truth.

908
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:55,887
Just remember that “two completely different
versions of the truth” cannot coexist.

909
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,231
One of them is false.

910
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:05,697
If history has taught us anything, is that most of the
time, the official story is not the truthful one.

911
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:12,620
You might find comfort in believing it since the
official story is usually the most convenient one.

912
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:16,624
Wow... What's the occasion?

913
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:19,877
Well... We killed Crowley.

914
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:26,592
You've got the right to speak. You've
got the right to speak and question...

915
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:30,213
And if they try to shut you up by telling
you that science doesn't back you up...

916
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:34,517
remind them that science
is never ever settled...

917
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:39,314
I'm Pilar Franco, and this is “The Hammer”.

918
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:43,317
One of these days,
you're gonna get us killed.

919
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:48,072
- Influencers don't get killed; they get deplatformed...
- Same shit.

920
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:53,453
Until that happens to us, let's keep our followers
happy and engagement is the name of the game.

921
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,705
Speaking of engagement...

922
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:01,836
I was hoping we need to find
a more permanent solution.

923
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,399
If you're talking about Marvin, we're
not ready to launch our own platform yet...

924
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,759
I'm not talking about our careers...

925
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:10,803
I was talking about us.

926
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,516
Don't play with me, girl...

927
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:20,980
Actually, I was hoping to play
with you for the rest of our lives.

928
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:26,235
Ouch!

929
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:33,910
Ouch...

930
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,121
I don't think this is gonna work...

931
01:29:37,288 --> 01:29:39,957
I guess not!

932
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:43,002
It's not gonna be easy, you know...

933
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,051
I wouldn't have it any other way...
