1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,040
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,490
(laboratory machinery beeps)

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,700
(mysterious music)

4
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,260
(music fades)

5
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,590
(monster movie music)

6
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,800
(gorilla roars)

7
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,510
(young woman screams)

8
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,660
(young woman screams)
(robot-gorilla roars)

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,180
- Here's your toast...

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,600
Sorry, it's a little burnt.

11
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,610
(young woman screams)

12
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,290
- Katherine, I'm out of Delta 100's.

13
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,660
- Well, is it my fault if you
smoke like a damn chimney?

14
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,630
Do you think I'm just gonna
drop whatever I'm doing...

15
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,060
and go out and
get you your cigarettes?

16
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,910
- The store's just through the park...

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,650
Go myself...

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,750
but you know I can't walk
on these damn useless legs.

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,840
- Oh, All right...

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,550
I'll get you your damn Delta 100's...

21
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,760
In fact, I'll get you a whole suitcase full...

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,930
just so you'll stop bugging me about it...

23
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,640
you old turd...

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,520
Christ, I hate it when you get all pitiful.

25
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,640
(young woman screams)
(gorilla grunts)

26
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,610
Pain in my ass...

27
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,830
It's always something else...

28
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,680
always something else.

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,240
(robot-gorilla groans)
(young woman screams)

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,160
(melancholy piano music)

31
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,860
It's like I have nothing better to do...

32
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,750
but to walk across this stupid park...

33
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,360
to pick up his damn Delta 100's.

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,240
He thinks I'm his God damn servant...

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,010
Well, I'm not!

36
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,580
- Come on, lady...give it up!

37
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,120
- Christ, I hate this park.

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
- Give me the purse, lady...
before I beat the shit outta ya.

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,500
- Blow it outta your ass, ya weirdo!

40
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,050
- Stupid bitch!

41
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,080
(Katherine grunts)
(intense music)

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,710
- Let go ya creep!
(intense music)

43
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,800
(groans)

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,100
- Oh!

45
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,640
Bitch!

46
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,850
(Katherine screams)

47
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,750
You think you're tough, bitch?

48
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,650
You gonna beat the crap out of me, now?

49
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,730
- I'm gonna rip your God damn balls off!

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,030
(Katherine gasps)

51
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,320
(intense music)

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,540
- [robber] Shit!

53
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,750
Sorry, lady!

54
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,570
(upbeat music)

55
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,130
(music fades)

56
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,380
- [female voice] Can I help you?

57
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,300
- Hello...

58
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,340
My name is Andrew March...

59
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,070
I have a nine o'clock
appointment with Dr. Benderfax.

60
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,100
(door buzzer)

61
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,400
(distant sleepy piano)

62
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,510
- Good morning.

63
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,950
- Good morning, Dr. March...

64
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,270
I'm Nurse Clench...

65
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,010
ward supervisor of
the Benderfax Institute.

66
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,040
- How do you do?

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,080
- Dr. Benderfax has been expecting you...

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,210
If you'll follow me...
I'll show you to his office.

69
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,240
(slow suspenseful music)

70
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,550
- In my next series of tests...
I shall again stimulate key organs...

71
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,680
to isolate the source
of the Telefaximial Field...

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,400
I suspect that the spleen
the gallbladder and the intestines...

73
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,610
may all be involved...

74
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,860
possibly working together...

75
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,400
Previous results indicate that
substantial electro-chemical...

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,530
amplification of the source image
will be required for optimum reception...

77
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,450
I'm very close to a breakthrough...

78
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,730
I'm sure of it!

79
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,670
(knock at door)

80
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,500
Come in...

81
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,570
- [Andrew] Dr. Benderfax.

82
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,700
- Ah...And you must be Andrew March...

83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,640
Please sit down.

84
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,490
- Thank you, Sir...

85
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,740
It's truly an honor to meet you, Sir.

86
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,550
- You have an impressive scholastic record...

87
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,010
and some excellent references, Doctor...

88
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,430
I'd have thought you could have
secured a position at any number of...

89
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,850
esteemed research institutions...

90
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,980
so, what enticed you to apply at our...

91
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,690
humble operation?

92
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,940
- Well, Sir...

93
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,860
I based my thesis in medical school...

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,300
on your psycho-neuroliptocism theories...

95
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,200
In many ways, you've been
my mentor, Dr. Benderfax.

96
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,240
- Well, I'm very flattered, Andrew...

97
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,200
if I may call you Andrew...

98
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,370
Cookie?

99
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,370
- Yes, Sir...

100
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,580
Thank you, Sir.

101
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,460
- Not many in the scientific community...

102
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,250
fully appreciated my
neuroliptocism work.

103
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,050
- Your discoveries of psychic
neuro-electric transmissions...

104
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,800
from organs other than the
brain is groundbreaking...

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,050
The implications are...

106
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,390
are staggering!

107
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,930
- You're very perceptive, Andrew...

108
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,770
In fact, my current experiments...

109
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,480
delve into a similar
area of investigation.

110
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,560
- I'm very happy to hear that, Sir.

111
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,770
- Now, about your qualifications.

112
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,970
- Yes, Sir?

113
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,820
- I was quite impressed by some
dog illustrations, you sent...

114
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,490
along with your resume.

115
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,720
- Well, thank you.

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,990
I pride myself on doing accurate
anatomical illustrations...

117
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,040
It's a skill that I've
practiced since my youth.

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
- Take a look at these sketches, Andrew...

119
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
I'd like your opinion.

120
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,780
(ominous music)

121
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,130
-[Andrew] These are, uh...

122
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,880
part of your current experiments?

123
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,510
-[Benderfax] Yes, that's right...

124
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,260
They're rough...
but all the structures are there...

125
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,560
Do you suppose you could produce
color renderings of these...

126
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,810
suitable for publication?

127
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,000
- Yes...

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,350
I would be honored to assist you
in any way that I can.

129
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,570
- Excellent...That's just what
I wanted to hear, Andrew...

130
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,030
I'd like you to get started
right away, if you can--

131
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,460
- I can start today, Sir.

132
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,610
- Very good....

133
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,780
Of course...

134
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,700
your primary responsibilities
will consist of patient testing...

135
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,410
psychological workups...endocrine panels...

136
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,750
that sort of thing...

137
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,830
But I'd like you to dedicate
at least three hours a day...

138
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,080
to the illustration work...

139
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,610
Sound reasonable?

140
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,130
- Yes...Fine, Sir.

141
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,830
- [Benderfax] Nurse Clench
will explain in detail...

142
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,630
your responsibilities on the ward...

143
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,550
and lay out the Institute rules...

144
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,970
It may be my name on the sign out front...

145
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,720
but it's Nurse Clench, who governs the ward.

146
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,460
(chuckles)

147
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
- I understand, Sir.

148
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,190
- I have a good feeling about you, Andrew...

149
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,130
I'm sure you'll fit in here just fine...

150
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,490
Welcome to the Institute!

151
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,570
- Thank you, Sir!

152
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,030
(distant piano)

153
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,250
- Haircut...

154
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,760
Haircut!

155
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,820
(spine-chilling music)

156
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,440
(distant piano)

157
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,450
- Miss Snow...
(distant piano)

158
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,740
- Miss Snow...

159
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,180
This is Dr. March...our newest staff member.

160
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,490
- [Carmen] Nice to meet you.

161
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:03,510
- [Andrew] The pleasure's mine.
- [Carmen] Nice to meet you.

162
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,950
- [Andrew] The pleasure's mine.

163
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,550
- When you've finished here, Miss Snow...

164
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,460
would you please show
Dr. March the wards...

165
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,220
and familiarize him with the patients?

166
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,500
- I'd be happy to.

167
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,630
- If you'll excuse me, Dr. March...

168
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,840
I have a pressing matter to attend to...

169
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,120
Miss Snow should be able to answer any...

170
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,510
questions you might
have about the Institute.

171
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,140
- Thank you, Nurse...Clench.

172
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,850
- Haircut.

173
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,940
(suspenseful music)

174
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,980
(music fades)

175
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,690
- Nice to see you working
as hard as usual, Martin...

176
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,320
Did you have any trouble
with the new admission?

177
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,040
- The stroker?

178
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,990
No...She was no problem...

179
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,080
But that freakin' ambulance
driver upped his rate...

180
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
to 75 bucks this time...

181
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,460
Speaking of which...

182
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,900
it's time I was getting a little raise...

183
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,420
Don't you think?

184
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
- Martin...

185
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,590
is money the only thing
you can think about?

186
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,130
- [Martin] What? You think I work here
for my freakin' health?

187
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,550
- If it wasn't for Dr. Benderfax...

188
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,800
you'd still be working in the
prison hospital, wouldn't you?

189
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,810
- [Martin] Yeah, Lavinia...

190
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,730
but I know you're glad I'm here instead.

191
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,010
- Martin, I find you vial and disgusting

192
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,730
in almost every way...

193
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
but you do have a certain attraction.

194
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,700
(suspenseful music)

195
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,290
(loud pants and grunts)

196
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,210
(distant piano)

197
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,140
(patient barks like dog)

198
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,510
- This is quite a facility...

199
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,920
I understand it was once
a military hospital.

200
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,760
- That's true...

201
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,640
Dr. Benderfax acquired it
for his neurological research...

202
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,630
when the Army moved
its base 10 years ago.

203
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,690
- That's very interesting...

204
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,270
I've read many good things
about Dr. Benderfax...

205
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,370
and his work here.

206
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,690
- Well, he's a fascinating man.

207
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,010
- I agree...

208
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,640
I can't tell you how happy I am...

209
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,810
that he was impressed
with my qualifications...

210
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,280
Unfortunately...I don't think Nurse Clench...

211
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,070
is nearly as enthusiastic.

212
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,940
Where does that door lead?

213
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,450
- Oh, that leads to the sub levels...

214
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,020
and Dr. Benderfax's personal laboratory.

215
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,620
It's off limits to the regular staff.

216
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,220
- Mm...like you and me...

217
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,550
- Right...You wanna see it?

218
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
- But if it's off limits, I...

219
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,140
- Come on. Don't worry...

220
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,070
I know where all the
security cameras are.

221
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,020
- Sure...it's not like I wanna keep the
job more than one day or anything.

222
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,400
(electric guitar song)

223
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,110
♪ Now that we are one ♪

224
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,930
Who's that?

225
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,040
♪ Our life has just begun ♪

226
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,650
- That's Martin Wise...

227
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,980
he guards Dr. Benderfax's laboratory.

228
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,190
- A guard...

229
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,020
What for?

230
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,630
- Well, about a year ago...

231
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,440
there was a doctor here...
named Clarence Blitz.

232
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,630
He went completely berserk...

233
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,760
and tried to destroy the laboratory.

234
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,470
He set loose all the animals...

235
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,350
and he even stoles some of
Dr. Benderfax's lab notes.

236
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,230
- Geez...

237
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,640
What did he do that for?

238
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
- Well, the police said he was some kind of...

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,550
radical animal rights activist...

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
They said he was probably
planning the break in...

241
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,830
from the beginning.

242
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,710
It all seemed so strange, though...

243
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,000
I knew Clarence...

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,520
He seemed completely normal...

245
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
You'd never have known.

246
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,070
- Well, What happened?

247
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,520
I hope they caught him.

248
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,380
- No...They didn't...

249
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,670
It's been at least a year.

250
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,620
- Oh...

251
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
You know, it's fanatics like that...

252
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,310
that really get me going...

253
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,160
I mean, everyone is entitled
to free expression, but...

254
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,880
some people they...
they just go over the edge.

255
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,210
(laboratory machinery beeps)
(dramatic music)

256
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,180
- [Benderfax] Can you hear me, Mr. Froom?

257
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,720
Mr. Froom, if you can hear me...
blink your eyes.

258
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,140
Very good, Mr. Froom...

259
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,100
Now, I'm going to stimulate
various areas of your brain...

260
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,650
with small amounts
of electric current...

261
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,570
Just relax, and I'll take care
of everything from here...

262
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,070
Okay?

263
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,240
(laboratory machinery beeps)
(dramatic music)

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,500
(loud beeps)

265
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,410
Now, what was that all about?

266
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,480
It's okay, Mr. Froom...

267
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,170
I'll figure this out...

268
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,720
Here, let's try something else.

269
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,140
(laboratory machinery beeps)
(dramatic music)

270
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,520
(heart beat thumps)

271
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,920
I think that might be your
lucky number, Mr. Froom...

272
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,820
You're feeling your
adrenal glands kick in...

273
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,980
Do you like that?

274
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,290
Everything seems normal...

275
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,790
Blood pressure's up a bit...

276
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,500
Hm...looks like you're getting
a stiffy there, Mr. Froom...

277
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
I wonder what you're thinking about?

278
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,880
All right...

279
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,550
Let's take things up a
notch or two, why don't we?

280
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,720
(laboratory machinery beeps)
(dramatic music)

281
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,120
Just a bit more, Mr. Froom...

282
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,060
(laboratory machinery beeps)
(dramatic music)

283
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,570
(electricity crackles)
(dramatic music)

284
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,280
Just a bit more...

285
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,540
Stay with me, Mr. Froom...

286
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:22,080
(rising overload drone)

287
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:29,460
(loud pulsing overload alarm)

288
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
This is not the response
I was looking for, Mr. Froom.

289
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,970
(Mr. Froom groans)
(dramatic upbeat music)

294
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980

295
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,860

296
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,820

300
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,660
(distant sleepy piano)

301
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,500
- Ah...Froom's room, I presume.

302
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,540
- Hm...Mr. Froom...

303
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,710
He used to decorate his door
to help him remember...

304
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,130
which room was his.

305
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,590
- Hm...So I take it Mr. Froom is...oh!
Checked out...

306
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,140
- Yeah, you could say that...
He died in his sleep last night.

307
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,100
- I'm sorry...

308
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,420
What was the cause of death?

309
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,100
- I think Nurse Clench said
it was a cerebral aneurism.

310
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,770
- Hm...Well how did they
determine that so quickly?

311
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,990
- Um...Dr. Benderfax examined him himself.

312
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,220
- Oh, really?

313
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,050
- Yeah...

314
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,770
There's a new patient
in Mr. Froom's room now...

315
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,970
A 70 year old woman named Wilma Beagle...

316
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,200
Apparently, she was homeless...

317
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,410
She was brought here
after suffering a minor stroke...

318
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,000
She's improving, but for now
she's still unable to speak...

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,960
and has no feeling in her left hand.

320
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,180
- Poor woman.

321
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,640
(dramatic upbeat music)

322
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,300
- Oh!

323
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,520
Hello?

324
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,350
Hm...

325
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,070
(distant sleepy piano)

326
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:08,200
(Andrew whistles)

327
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,550
- Hi Wilma.

328
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,600
What do you have there?

329
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,420
(dramatic upbeat music)

330
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,700
(phone rings)

331
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,180
- Hello.

332
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,410
- Hi, Carmen?

333
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,500
Hi, it's Andrew March, over at the Institute.

334
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,250
- Oh, hi Andrew...What a surprise.

335
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,460
- I hope you don't mind
me calling you like this...

336
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,550
I had your number in my office Rolodex.

337
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,330
- [Carmen] Oh no, not at all...

338
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,840
What can I do for you?

339
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,970
Really?

340
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,430
What did it say?

341
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,100
- I'm not quite sure...

342
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,270
but I'd like you take a look at it...

343
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,890
Could I interest you in a bite to eat?

344
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,480
- Oh, sounds fine...

345
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,910
Just give me a couple
minutes to change, okay?

346
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,610
- I can pick you up if you'd like...

347
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,400
Um...

348
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,610
Do you still live at 3967 Normal Street?

349
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,030
- So...

350
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,780
You know my address, too...

351
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:26,790
(Farance gasps)
You know my address, too...

352
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,780
(Farance gasps)

353
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,840
Very interesting.
(Farance gasps)

354
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,730
So, if you ever wanted to send me something...

355
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,290
- I guess I'd be prepared, wouldn't I?

356
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,460
How much time will you need?

357
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,710
- Just give me 20 minutes, okay?

358
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:41,720
(Farance gasps)
- Just give me 20 minutes, okay?

359
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,510
(Farance gasps)

360
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,390
Sounds great...

361
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,320
Bye Andrew.

362
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,810
(Farance gasps)

363
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,350
(grunts)

364
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,090
(romantic music in cafe)
♪ Now that love is won ♪

365
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,910
(Carmen and Andrew laugh)
♪ Life has just begun ♪

366
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,740
- Thanks.

367
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,160
- So, what about this note
you said Wilma wrote?

368
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,310
- Oh...

369
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,650
I have it right here....

370
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,710
I don't know...

371
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,300
It's probably just a bunch of scribbles.

372
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,460
- Hm...

373
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,260
In...

374
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,720
Innocent?

375
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,890
- Do you think she was trying to say...

376
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,600
she was an innocent victim?

377
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,700
- Well, she was attacked...

378
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,640
She's probably still very frightened.

379
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,230
- It just makes me sick
thinking of some creep...

380
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,950
beating up on that frail old woman...

381
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,820
I mean, what kind of world
are we living in anyway?

382
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,780
- Andrew, do you always get so
emotional over your patients?

383
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,000
- I'm sorry...

384
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,410
It's hard to be detached, sometimes.

385
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,660
- Yeah, like with Mr. Froom...

386
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,640
He was admitted to the Institute...

387
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,430
the day I started working there.

388
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,580
He was a sweet old man...

389
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,590
I guess that's why I keep
putting off taking down...

390
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,510
all those names from his door.

391
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,890
- Sounds like we're both a bit
sentimental, Carmen.

392
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,460
- I won't tell anybody, if you don't.

393
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,810
(Carmen and Andrew laugh)

394
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,330
(romantic music)

395
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,440
- [Andrew] I had a really nice time tonight.

396
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,710
- So did I...

397
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,990
By the way...thanks for the flowers.

398
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,780
- Flowers?

399
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,990
- Oh...

400
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,330
What am I saying? It must be getting late...

401
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,540
I meant, thank you for
inviting me out tonight.

402
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,330
- Well, it was my pleasure...

403
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,460
Oh and next time...

404
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm bringing flowers.

405
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
- Oh, I didn't mean...

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,130
that I thought that you should--
-Oh, no, no, no, no. Of course not.

407
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,640
- Goodnight, Andrew.

408
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,550
- Goodnight, Carmen.

409
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,280
(distant sleepy piano)

410
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,510
- Hello, young man...

411
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,160
Joe, isn't it?

412
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,350
- Farance, Ma'am.

413
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,180
- Oh, yes...

414
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,010
Farance...

415
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,240
I hope you won't mind if I pay
you for the milk next time...

416
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,090
My husband forgot to leave me
the money to pay you again...

417
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,550
He's getting so forgetful these days.

418
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,950
- It's no problem...
but it's only water, Mrs. Seawinner...

419
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,810
Did ya sleep well last night?

420
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,370
- Just like a log.

421
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,410
- Glad to hear it...

422
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,610
I'll see you later.

423
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,280
- Thank you for the milk, Farance...

424
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,370
Nice man, that Farance.

425
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,570
- Well...

426
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,160
This is it.

427
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,990
- Have you read many endocrine panels?

428
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,410
- A few...You?

429
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,890
- Well, all the patients
get tested once a month.

430
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,670
- How do they feel about blood tests?

431
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,420
- I haven't had any complaints yet.

432
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,960
- Well, you probably have
excellent bedside manner.

433
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,160
(glasses clatter)

434
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,840
- Oh, Farance...Have you met him yet?

435
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,860
- No, I haven't.

436
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,760
- Farance, can you come
over here for a minute?

437
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,680
I'd like you to meet someone.

438
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,930
- Yes, I'll be right there.

439
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,150
- Farance...this is Dr. March.

440
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,830
(spine-chilling music)

441
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,800
- [Andrew] It's a pleasure to meet you, Farance.

442
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,620
- Oh, welcome to the Institute, Doctor.

443
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,030
- [Andrew] Thanks, it's great to be here.

444
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,780
- If you would excuse me...
I was just on the way to the head...

445
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,490
- [Andrew] Huh?

446
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,030
- I mean the lavatory.

447
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,960
- Certainly...

448
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,680
Is he--

449
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,820
- Farance was once a
promising medical student...

450
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,260
until he developed schizophrenia...

451
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,820
and began having hallucinations.

452
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,770
- Really?

453
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,370
- Yeah...His condition's greatly improved...

454
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,900
since he's been on medication...

455
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,220
He's been living in the city
on his own for over a year...

456
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,680
but he likes to keep
in contact with the Institute...

457
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,470
delivering water to the patients...

458
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,560
helping out in the kitchen.

459
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,980
- I see.

460
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
- Andrew, uh...
Could you excuse me for a minute?

461
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,650
- Yeah, sure.

462
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,490
(water splashing)
- Oh...

463
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,790
(ominous music)

464
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,840
(distant piano)

465
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,480
- Farance, wait a minute...

466
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,880
Are you okay?

467
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,510
- Me? Yes, I'm fine...

468
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,310
What is it?

469
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,620
- Somebody sent me flowers last night.

470
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,890
- Yeah, really?

471
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,720
- Yeah...There was a note attached...

472
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,050
but it didn't say who they were from...

473
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,560
I thought maybe you--

474
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,580
- Me?

475
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,410
No, it wasn't me...

476
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,400
I had to work really late last night...

477
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,610
It must have been somebody else.

478
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,070
- I hope you're not lying to me, Farance.

479
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,390
- No, honest...

480
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,860
Maybe it was that new doctor, um...

481
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,070
What's his name?

482
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,820
- [Carmen] Dr. March?

483
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,480
- Yes, maybe he sent 'em.

484
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,490
- Why would you think that?

485
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,040
- I don't know...It's just that...

486
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,200
you an him seem to be getting on so well and--

487
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,080
- [Carmen] Yeah, well...

488
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,450
Dr. March said he didn't send them either.

489
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,280
- Hm...

490
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,550
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you, Carmen, but...

491
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,030
I hope you do figure it out.

492
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,520
- Yeah, sorry to bother you, Farance.

493
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,550
- Oh, no bother...See you later.

494
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,600
- These accidents are happening
too often, Thomas...

495
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,800
Mr. Froom had relatives, you know?

496
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,690
They're going to want to know
what happened to him.

497
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,510
- It's all in the death certificate...

498
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,180
A cerebral aneurism in his sleep...

499
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,200
Why should they question it?

500
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,570
They should be thrilled
the old bugger's dead!

501
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,190
- I'm not asking you to stop
your experiments, Thomas...

502
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,080
Just allow me to select the subjects...

503
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,410
as I have from the beginning.

504
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,620
- All right, Lavinia...

505
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,130
but I have to have a
replacement subject by tonight...

506
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,880
I'm in a critical stage
with my experiments...

507
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,840
and I don't want any further delays.

508
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
- [Clench] Your young doctor...

509
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,460
is running endocrine panels today...

510
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,660
We should get the results
by this afternoon.

511
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,350
- Hi, Mrs. Seawinner...How are you?

512
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,220
- Fine...Joe, isn't it?

513
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,270
- No, Ma'am, it's Andrew.

514
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,540
- Oh, yes, Andrew...

515
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,650
You're new, aren't you?

516
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,430
- Yeah, I just started here.

517
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,410
(Mrs. Seawinner screams)

518
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,260
Ah!

519
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,830
Here's hold this on there...

520
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,750
(Mrs. Seawinner gasps)

521
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,130
Sorry, Mrs. Seawinner.

522
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,160
(Mrs. Seawinner sniffles)

523
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,030
Hello, Larry...

524
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,740
[Andrew] Uh...

525
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,920
[Andrew] Uh...Larry?

526
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,960
[Andrew] Hi Fred, How you doing today?

527
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,680
You know, I saw you making eyes
at Mrs. Smithers, in room 201...

528
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,010
(Andrew laughs)

529
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,930
All right...You're all set.

530
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,930
- Hm...

531
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,230
What about that new admission...
the Jane Doe?

532
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,650
- She appears to have suffered a stroke...

533
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,010
She's mute, and there's some
paralysis in the left arm...

534
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,570
I went through the old files
the military left in the basement...

535
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,240
and I found her a good match...

536
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,820
with an Army nurse named, Wilma Beagle...

537
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,700
who died in 1945...

538
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,700
I admitted our Jane Doe under that name.

539
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,210
- Excellent...

540
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm anxious to see her adrenal output.

541
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,640
- You'll have to wait for the test results...

542
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,170
but I wouldn't get your hopes up...

543
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,880
She's quite catatonic.

544
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,170
- Hm...

545
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,090
That may not matter...

546
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,600
Get me those test results
as quickly as you can...

547
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,220
I'm looking forward to meeting our Wilma.

548
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,350
- [Andrew] Hi, Wilma...

549
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,980
Wilma, can you hear me?

550
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,940
What does this note say?

551
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,820
Does that say innocent?

552
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,080
- Maybe she can hear us...
but she's just unable to respond...

553
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,990
See if she'll write something.

554
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,540
- [Andrew] Here, Wilma...We'll take that...

555
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,500
Here, hold this pen...

556
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,300
Can you write something else for me?

557
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,120
[Andrew] There you go...

558
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,520
Thanks, Wilma.

559
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,820
- Maybe we can try again tomorrow.

560
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,280
- [Andrew] Yeah...
I guess she just needs more time.

561
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,540
(dramatic upbeat music)

562
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,720
(phone rings)

563
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,360
Andrew March.

564
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,350
- Have any plans tonight?

565
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,220
- [Andrew] Carmen...

566
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,720
I was just working on some, uh...

567
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,200
dog illustrations for Dr. Benderfax...

568
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
Did you have anything in mind?

569
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,810
- Well, no...

570
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,150
but there has been a lot of
activity in my ant farm, lately.

571
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,650
- I see...

572
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,860
Well, sure...

573
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,370
Sure, I think I could stop by
and see your...ants.

574
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,660
- What about your dog drawings?

575
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,910
- [Andrew] Oh, I think I've put in
enough time on them for one night...

576
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,580
Besides...

577
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,420
I think the little fella
I've been working on...

578
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,640
is just about finished.

579
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,090
(cheery music)

580
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,340
Um...

581
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,260
Ahh...

582
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,480
(spine-chilling ominous music)

583
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,570
(distant piano)
(phone rings)

584
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,050
Benderfax Institute...This is Dr. March.

585
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,260
- I'm looking for my wife, Katherine Grider.

586
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,430
- Well I don't recognize the name, sir...

587
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,300
but let me check the admissions records.

588
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,890
[Andrew] Let's see...
Graham, Gray, Griffin, Grant...

589
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,270
I'm sorry, I can't seem to
find her name in the records...

590
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,020
Perhaps she was admitted
to County Hospital.

591
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,070
- They don't know crap.

592
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,860
They told me to call
the Benderfax Institute.

593
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,700
- Well, maybe you could stop by tomorrow...

594
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,340
and talk to Nurse Clench...

595
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,240
If your wife is here...
then she would know for sure.

596
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,730
- Well how would I do that?

597
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,200
I can't walk worth a damn...

598
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,870
I can't do much of anything
without Katherine's help...

599
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,210
Help me out, Doc...

600
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,820
I'm gonna die here in this
God damned apartment...

601
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,840
I can't get around to even
get anything to eat...Nothing...

602
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,670
The damn police won't even take a report...

603
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:49,690
Nobody does crap!
The damn police won't even take a report...

604
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,430
Nobody does crap!

605
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,430
- Where do you live, Mr. Grider?

606
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,390
- Riviera Hotel...Room 112.

607
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,770
- Okay, I'll tell you what...
that's not too far from here...

608
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,210
Uh...I'll bring you
something to eat tonight...

609
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,690
and we'll see about
getting you help tomorrow.

610
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,360
- Bring me some cigarettes, Doc...

611
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,730
Delta 100's?

612
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,120
- Sure, all right, Mr. Grider.

613
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,030
(mysterious music)

614
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,040
- [Vincent] Who is it?

615
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,960
- Uh...Mr. Grider, it's Andrew March.

616
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,160
- [Vincent] Ah...Come in, Doc.

617
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,430
- Hello...

618
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,690
I got you something to eat.

619
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,250
- Ah...You bring cigarettes?

620
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,910
- Oh, yeah...Delta 100's, right?

621
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,620
- Well, Give 'em here, quick!

622
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,550
[Vincent] Give me a light, Doc...
Matches there on the table.

623
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,550
- Uh...sure.

624
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,940
- You don't know how long it's been
since I've had a smoke, Doc...

625
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,530
I thought I was gonna die...
I really did.

626
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,610
- Listen...

627
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,990
I could arrange for you to get a room
over at the Institute, until--

628
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,030
- I'm not goin' to no hospital...

629
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,170
Just find Katherine, that's all.

630
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,290
- Uh...

631
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,870
Do you...uh...have any pictures
of Katherine, I could look at?

632
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,630
- Pictures?

633
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,590
Uh...Yeah, there's a family album...

634
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,960
right there on the table beside you...

635
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,760
Here, let me have it.

636
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,220
There...

637
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,390
That's Katherine...

638
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,810
14 years old...

639
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,350
Oh, she hates that picture...

640
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,520
That was the year
the dog bit her in the ear...

641
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Swolled up somethin' terrible...

642
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,980
Uh...That's our wedding picture...

643
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,900
And there we are on our
honeymoon...Niagara Falls.

644
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,740
- Uh..No...What I meant is...

645
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,470
do you have anything taken
within the last year or two?

646
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,280
- Oh no...The camera broke
a long time ago...

647
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,200
Don't even know what happened to it...

648
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,700
Wait a minute...Here's somethin'...

649
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,710
This is 1954...That's Katherine
in her bee keepin' outfit...

650
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,500
We had that little bee farm
up by Ramona...

651
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
She never got stung neither.

652
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,970
- Did Katherine have an ID card
or a drivers license or--

653
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,260
- No...The state took her drivers
license away a long time ago...

654
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,610
on account of her vision...

655
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,850
She can't see worth a damn.

656
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,730
- Look...

657
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,230
Maybe I can take some of these
pictures back with me, and...

658
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,070
I'll see what I can find out.

659
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,150
- Well, all right...but...

660
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,980
don't let anything happen to 'em...

661
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,910
Katherine'd kill me.

662
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:12,170
(melancholy piano music)

663
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,710
(laboratory machinery quietly beeps)

664
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,920
- No need to worry, my dear...

665
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:19,930
You're in good hands...
- No need to worry, my dear...

666
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,550
You're in good hands...

667
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:27,310
I'll tell you a little story, while we're
waiting for the anesthetic to work...Okay?

668
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,690
It's about my dog, Boxy...

669
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,440
It was many years ago...

670
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,980
but I can still remember just how he looked...

671
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,820
hiding in that cardboard box
in my Father's laboratory...

672
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,620
Boxy loved me right from the start...

673
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,200
and I him...

674
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,950
My course was clear...

675
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,360
I rescued him from the lab
and made him my secret pet...

676
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,380
For more than a month
I kept him hidden in my room...

677
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,760
and for that brief period...

678
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,380
I was truly happy...

679
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,890
But then my father discovered him...

680
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,770
Father didn't care that Boxy was
my best friend in the world...

681
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,690
To Father...little Boxy...

682
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,400
was just a lab dog...

683
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,480
He took him back into his laboratory...

684
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,700
and I never saw him again...

685
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,870
Silly...

686
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,040
but I still think about Boxy sometimes...

687
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,080
The most loyal friend I ever had...

688
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,040
You really are an excellent patient...

689
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,920
Do you know that my dear?

690
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,720
(cheerful music)

691
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,970
- Industrious little guys...aren't they?

692
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,430
- Yeah...I could watch 'em for hours...

693
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,430
They always know exactly what
they're supposed to be doing...

694
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,700
They're always working
for the same purpose...

695
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,360
to make their little world
a little bit better...

696
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,400
People could learn a lot from ants.

697
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,610
- Mm...I agree.

698
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,700
- By the way, Andrew...

699
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,990
thanks for the flowers...They're beautiful.

700
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,540
- I'm glad you like them.

701
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,410
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here...I...

702
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,210
I went to see a man who called
the...uh...Institute about his wife.

703
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,590
- Oh, really?

704
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,130
- His name's Vincent Grider...

705
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,340
He says his, uh...

706
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,260
he says his wife is...uh...

707
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,890
She's been missing for a few days and so--

708
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,760
- Oh no.

709
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,890
- He's all alone in his apartment, so I just...

710
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,640
I brought some food
and cigarettes over...to him.

711
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,360
- Oh, that's so sweet of you.

712
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,110
- Oh, it was...it was no big deal.

713
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,320
- You're so modest.

714
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,120
(suspenseful music)

715
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,170
- Test subject K26...white female...late 60's...

716
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,340
possible stroke victim...

717
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,220
Image acceleration threshold was
much lower than previous subjects...

718
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,430
apparently due to a high adrenal output...
enhancing the electrochemical field...

719
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,770
This increase in field potential
seems inversely related to the...

720
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,480
sensor distance...

721
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,400
Therefore, placing the sensor
probes directly in contact...

722
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
with the adrenal cortex...

723
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,030
may resolve the interference problems...

724
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,740
(knocking)

725
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,930
Come in.

726
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,120
Oh, it's you, Andrew...

727
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,860
How are my illustrations coming along?

728
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,170
- Oh, just fine Sir.

729
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,920
- Glad to hear it...

730
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,340
Cookie?

731
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,370
- Thank you, Sir.

732
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,260
- [Benderfax] What can I do for you?

733
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,890
- Mm...actually...

734
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,760
I've gotten myself into
an awkward situation...

735
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,480
and I wanted your advice.

736
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,000
- What's the problem?

737
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,900
- A man called the Institute last night...
looking for his wife...

738
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,270
Apparently, County Hospital had
told him that she was here.

739
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,820
- The woman's name?

740
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,780
- [Andrew] Katherine Grider, Sir.

741
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,530
- Grider?

742
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,370
Not one of ours.

743
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,130
- Yes Sir, I know...

744
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,450
but Mr. Grider...

745
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,570
sounded pretty bad on the phone...

746
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,250
He said he hadn't eaten
since his wife left...

747
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,790
So, I went to see him.

748
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,540
- Oh?

749
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,290
- Yeah, he lives just a few blocks away...

750
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,000
at the Riviera Hotel...

751
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,020
Um...well...
at the Riviera Hotel...

752
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,880
Um...well...

753
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,710
I just by to check up on him...

754
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,050
and while I was there...

755
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,140
I told him I'd help him find his wife...

756
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,220
He gave me these photos of her...

757
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,480
I called the police about this...

758
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,850
but they have no report
of a woman matching her description...

759
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,880
I was hoping perhaps you'd
have some idea of what to do.

760
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,740
- These aren't recent, I take it?

761
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,320
- No...

762
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,280
Mrs. Grider is somewhere
in her mid 60's by now...

763
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,870
Not much to go on, are they?

764
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,250
- Hm...no...

765
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,870
I'll make a few calls...

766
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,500
and see what I can find out.

767
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,580
- Well, thank you Sir...
I would appreciate it.

768
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,460
- Consider it done, Andrew...

769
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,650
Is there anything else?

770
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,760
- [Andrew] Yes, actually...

771
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,340
I wanted to talk to you
to you about Wilma Beagle...

772
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,970
the new stroke patient...

773
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,600
She's been moved from her room...

774
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,510
and no one seems to know where she is.

775
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,020
- [Benderfax] You haven't heard?

776
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,430
- Heard what, Sir?

777
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,810
- Cerebral aneurism, I'm afraid...

778
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,100
late last night...

779
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,020
It was all very sudden.

780
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,400
- But...but I was working with her...

781
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,110
just yesterday.

782
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,110
- Yes, poor woman...

783
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,160
Sadly, these things
are quite hard to predict.

784
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,580
- I see.

785
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,670
(melancholy piano music)

786
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,730
(dramatic upbeat music)

787
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,690
(music fades)

788
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,150

(Farance hears ghostly voices
of his medical school doctors)

790
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,030
- [doctor's voices]
Make the incision, Mr. Wur.

791
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,870
- [doctor's voices]
The incision...

792
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,430
- [doctor's voices]
Make the incision, Mr. Wur...

793
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,950
- [doctor's voices]
Cut the flesh, Mr. Wur...

794
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:06,780
-The incision...

795
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,290
-Make the incision, Mr. Wur...

796
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,080
-I assure you...he's quite dead, Mr. Wur...

797
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,480
-He's definitely dead, Mr. Wur...

798
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,360
-Quite dead...

799
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,830
-Quite dead, Mr. Wur...

800
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,980
-We are all waiting, Mr. Wur...

801
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,400
-Are you ready to make
the incision, Mr. Wur?

802
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,140
-Make the incision, Mr. Wur...

803
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,730
-The incision...The incision...
The incision...The incision...

804
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,890
(knocking)
(ominous music fades)

805

(bat thuds)

806
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,200
- Carmen.

807
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,910
- Hi, Farance...Mind if I come in?

808
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,330
- No.

809
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,440
- Hey, you fixed up the place
since I was last here.

810
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,130
- I fixed the refrigerator.

811
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,550
Want a beer?

812
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,110
- Well, it's a little bit early, but...

813
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,390
sure, Farance...I'll have a beer.

814
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,190
(ominous music)

815
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,490
(ominous music)

816
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,620
You know, you shouldn't drink
too much beer being on medication.

817
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,580
(ominous music)

818
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,670
- It's okay...

819
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,090
I don't over do it.

820
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,300
- Thanks.

821
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,470
This is frozen, Farance...

822
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,470
I think you're set it a little high.

823
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,720
- No, don't!

824
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,300
- [Carmen] Don't worry...

825
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,600
I'm not going to break it...

826
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,140
just change the setting.

827
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,650
(ominous music)

828
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,980
Farance...

829
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,920
You haven't been taking
your medication, have you?

830
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,070
You know, it's very dangerous
to go on and off these drugs...

831
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,710
You could start having
hallucinations again.

832
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,240
(pills rattling)
(ominous music fades)

833
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:13,830
- So, is this a professional visit?

834
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,710
- I worry about you Farance.

835
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,710
- I can take care of myself.

836
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,550
- What am I gonna do with you?

837
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,380
You did leave those flowers
the other night, didn't you?

838
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,970
You're very sweet...

839
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,720
but you know I can't become
involved with a patient.

840
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,930
- I'm not a patient anymore!

841
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,400
[Carmen] Oh, Farance....

842
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
- Oh, Gosh...

843
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,190
Look, I gotta get going...

844
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,530
You've just got to stop
following me around...

845
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,580
You're only hurting yourself.

846
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,510
Take care...

847
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,440
I'll see you at work, okay?

848
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,420
- Okay.

849
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,550
(suspenseful music)

850
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,720
- What's goin' on, Lavinia?

851
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,390
- Martin, Dr. Benderfax
is still in the lab, isn't he?

852
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,930
- He's been in there all afternoon...

853
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,770
I thought you'd be stopping' by...

854
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,140
for a little visit.

855
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,730
- You're not paid to think, Martin...

856
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,860
and you shouldn't be
leaving the lab unguarded.

857
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
(Andrew breathing heavily)
(distant sleepy piano)

858

(sneezes)

859
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,990
- [Martin] I'm not paid to do a lot
of the things I do around here...

860
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,870
Just thought you'd be interested in
what Benderfax has his fingers in today.

861
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,130
- I thought you said you didn't know
or care what goes on in the lab.

862
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,500
- [Martin] Doesn't take a
freakin' genius to figure it out.

863
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,050
- What are you getting at?

864
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,140
- [Martin] Benderfax has been cutting'
on that new stroker since yesterday...

865
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,350
Probably has her all over his lab by now.

866
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,730
- Martin!

867
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,270
- Might even have her...

868
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,810
mutilated beyond recognition.

869
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,940
- Martin, this isn't the time...

870
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,610
or the place for this discussion.

871
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,280
(suspenseful music)

872
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,660

(police station phones ring)

901
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,150
(Detective sighs)

902
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,690
- Can I offer you some coffee, Doctor?

903
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,280
- Uh, no...Thank you, Detective.

904
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,540
- These allegations about
Dr. Benderfax are very serious...

905
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,990
Benderfax is a well known man in this area...

906
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,830
Are you sure you want to pursue this?

907
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,920
- Those incisions could
only have been made...

908
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,130
while that woman was alive, Detective...

909
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,210
Someone has got to stop Benderfax...

910
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,420
It's obvious that he's gone mad!

911
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,420
- I'd like to believe you, Doctor...

912
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,020
I truly would...

913
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,760
You see...?

914
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,890
I had a run in with Benderfax once, myself.
(sad piano music)

915
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,890
- Oh?

916
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,560
- Yep...

917
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,310
A few years back...
I had an old dog named, Murphy...

918
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,020
It may sound sentimental...

919
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,690
but I really loved that dog...

920
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,190
He wasn't very intelligent...

921
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,480
but he had spirit...
You know what I mean?

922
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,280
One time, I had to go out of town
for a couple of weeks on business...

923
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,370
When I came back...

924
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,540
Murphy was gone...

925
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,870
Got out of the yard, somehow...

926
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,170
There was a letter from
the pound in the mailbox...

927
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,460
They picked him up...
so I went down to bail him out...

928
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,360
But they said it was too late!

929
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,340
The pound said he'd been sold...

930
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,590
to a laboratory for research...

931
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,190
The Benderfax Institute...

932
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,260
Benderfax refused to
sell Murphy back to me...

933
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,720
There was nothing I could do...

934
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,810
Yep...

935
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,100
I still think about him sometimes...

936
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,980
being tortured in some dark laboratory...

937
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,150
finishing out his life a part
of some sadistic experiment!

938
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,490
Oh, I've been waiting for an excuse
to check out Benderfax's lab...

939
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,110
for a long time.

940
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,370
- So, you will investigate Benderfax?

941
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,450
- No, Doctor...I'm afraid not.

942
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,960
- What?

943
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,000
- As much as I'd like to...
there just isn't enough evidence...

944
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,170
I could lose my badge for
throwing around accusations about...

945
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,520
Benderfax doing human experiments...

946
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,970
Sorry...

947
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,220
Thanks for coming in.

948
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,930
- What...what?...That's it???

949
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,770
- I'm afraid so...

950
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:45,180
If you get any hard evidence...

951
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,850
we can talk so some more.

952
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,890
- Like what for instance?

953
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,650
- Like a corpse.

954
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,610
(suspenseful music)

955
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,080
(electronic static)
(music fades)

956
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,130
- I seem to remember putting you in charge...

957
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,460
of security at this facility, Lavinia...

958
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:20,050
but apparently you and Martin...
consider screwing in the supply closet...

959
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,300
a little bit more important!

960
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,220
I could've expected this kind of behavior...

961
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,470
from that cretinous thug...

962
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,850
but never from you.

963
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:32,020
- Perhaps, if you'd screened your
new applicants more carefully...

964
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
you wouldn't be in this predicament.

965
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,940
- Yes, I've made some errors of judgment...

966
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,240
Blitz, and now, March...

967
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,070
I'm beginning to wonder whether
any of these new doctors...

968
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,990
is worth a damn!

969
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,790
- What are you going to do?

970
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,370
(suspenseful music)

971
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:53,640
- I've sent Martin to tidy up a few loose ends...

972
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,750
If he follows my instructions...

973
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,420
we may be able to resolve...

974
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,670
an unfortunate situation...

975
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,760
before it gets out of hand.

976
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,100
- I don't want to hear any more, Andrew...

977
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,870
I can't be a part of this.

978
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:15,310
- Carmen, you didn't see what I saw.

979
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,860
- No, I didn't...

980
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,150
What am I supposed to think, Andrew?

981
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,160
This all sounds crazy...

982
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,370
I cannot believe that Dr. Benderfax...

983
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,580
would do those things.

984
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,990
- Carmen, do you really think...

985
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,160
that I would make something like this up?

986
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,620
- People have tried to
infiltrate the Institute before...

987
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,670
How can I be sure that you--

988
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,300
- Please, Carmen!

989
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,960
I am not a fanatic!

990
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,930
I am not a fanatic...

991
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,010
I know that...

992
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,140
everything I'm saying...

993
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,060
may sound crazy...

994
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,470
but it's true...

995
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,810
it's true...

996
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,640
It's terrible...

997
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,310
but it's true.

998
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,400
- I want to believe you, Andrew...but I can't.

999
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,490
- Carmen, Dr. Benderfax is killing people...

1000
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,860
We have got to stop him...

1001
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,120
before he kills again.

1002
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,080
- You'd better leave now, Andrew...

1003
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
I need some time to think.

1004
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,790
- Fine.

1005
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,790
Think!

1006
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,680
(suspenseful music)

1007
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,520
(Andrew grunting)

1008
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,410
(intense music)

1009
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,810
(knocking)

1010
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,730
(slow suspenseful music)

1011
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,360
- Horrible.

1012
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,150
- His name is Vincent Grider...

1013
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:26,280
We found him like this
in his apartment this morning...

1014
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,830
What would make a person do
something like this, Dr. Benderfax?

1015
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,370
- Well, Detective...

1016
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,370
My field is neurology, not psychiatry...

1017
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,830
but I would say...no one thing...

1018
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,170
It could be a combination of...

1019
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,750
instability...genetic flaws...

1020
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,130
paranoid thinking...

1021
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:48,050
perhaps, latent schizophrenia...

1022
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,470
repressed rage and hatred...

1023
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,310
all combining with some...

1024
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,560
drastic happening to drive a person...

1025
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,890
over the edge!

1026
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,600
Do you have a suspect?

1027
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,440
- As a matter of fact, we've identified...

1028
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,320
the fingerprints of one of
your staff at the crime scene...

1029
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,370
a Dr. Andrew March.

1030
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,030
- Are you suggesting that Andrew?

1031
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,700
- Were you aware that Dr. March
filed a police report on you last night...

1032
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,370
Dr. Benderfax?

1033
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,330
- A report on me?

1034
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,830
Whatever for?

1035
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,080
- March claimed you were
using patients here for...

1036
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,920
terminal experiments!

1037
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,450
He wanted me to shut your operation down.

1038
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,840
- Absurd!

1039
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,260
- Yeah, that's pretty much what I told him...

1040
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,850
Then, this morning we find Mr. Grider, here...

1041
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,310
and I figured I'd better talk to ya.

1042
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,270
- Surely, you don't suspect me?

1043
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,690
- No, Doctor...

1044
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,560
But I think March could
be trying to set you up.

1045
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,360
- Set me up?

1046
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,110
But why?

1047
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,780
- That was my next question, Doctor.

1048
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,950
- [Benderfax] I really wouldn't know.

1049
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,450
I just hired Andrew a couple of days ago...

1050
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,410
He has excellent credentials...

1051
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,500
and he's a very fine medical illustrator.

1052
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,630
- [Detective] Oh...

1053
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,920
Do you have any examples
of March's illustrations?

1054
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,300
- Why, yes...

1055
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,430
I have some of his drawings right here...

1056
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,680
[Benderfax] There you are, Detective.

1057
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,230
(suspenseful music)

1058
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,650
- March did this?

1059
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,860
- [Benderfax] That's right.

1060
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,570
- Tell me, Doctor...

1061
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,280
do you have any reason to think...

1062
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,990
March would want to move
from dogs to humans?

1063
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,330
- I'd never have guessed it...

1064
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,120
He seems like such a nice young man...

1065
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,920
but you never can tell, can you?

1066
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,420
Is he under arrest?

1067
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,460
- [Detective] We've had an A.P.B.
out on him for a few hours...

1068
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,510
But don't worry...

1069
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,590
we'll find him...

1070
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,310
Can I take this drawing with me, Doctor?

1071
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,770
- Please take them all.

1072
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,060
- I appreciate your cooperation, Sir.

1073
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,940
- Anything to help the police, Detective.

1074
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,990
(suspenseful music)

1075
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,820
(sad piano music)
(duck quacks)

1076
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,160
- Vincent...

1077
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,830
Vincent!

1078
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,380
(duck quacks)

1079
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,510
(dramatic upbeat music)

1080
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,310
(phone rings)

1081
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,450
- Hello.

1082
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,870
- Hello, Carmen...

1083
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,920
I hope I haven't caught you at a bad time...

1084
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,750
You haven't been answering the phone, dear.

1085
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,300
- Dr. Benderfax...

1086
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,220
I'm sorry...I was in the shower.

1087
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,720
- Ah...

1088
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,550
Nothing like a steamy shower...

1089
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,470
as therapy for the conscience...

1090
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,260
my father always used to say.

1091
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,390
- Come on...Carmen...Get off the phone.
(dramatic upbeat music)

1092
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,110
- What can I do for you, Dr. Benderfax?

1093
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:19,070
- Carmen...

1094
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:20,910
I need you to come into the Institute...

1095
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,700
and meet me in my office, immediately.

1096
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,490
- What's wrong, Sir?

1097
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:28,530
- I'm afraid I can't discuss
it on the phone, Carmen...

1098
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,790
Get here as quickly as you can...

1099
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,460
I'll explain everything in detail...

1100
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,420
when you arrive.

1101
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,210
- All right, Dr. Benderfax...

1102
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,470
I'll leave now, if it's that important.

1103
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,840
- Thank you, Carmen...

1104
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,380
I wouldn't ask you, if it wasn't.

1105
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,770
- Yes, Sir.

1106
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,770
(dramatic upbeat music)

1107
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,580
(engine revs)

1108
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,090
(dramatic upbeat music)

1109
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,890
(Farance screams)

1110
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,310
(bike crashes loudly)

1111
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:50,790
(sighs)

1112
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,040
(music fades)

1113
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,340
- [Andrew] I'm really sorry
about that, Farance...

1114
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,470
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the hospital?

1115
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,510
- No...No, forget about it...

1116
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,050
But I have something to tell you.

1117
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,300
- What is it?

1118
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,890
- I overheard a detective taking to...

1119
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,310
Dr. Benderfax at the Institute today...

1120
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,400
He seemed to think you killed
an old man named, Grider.

1121
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,900
- Vincent Grider?

1122
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,610
Oh, my God!

1123
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,610
- The detective said he has
an A.P.B. out on you...

1124
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,590
so you might not want
to be driving around.

1125
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,110
- But I didn't do it Farance.

1126
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,950
- That's not what the police think.

1127
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,200
- Great...

1128
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,990
First, Wilma is mutilated
in Benderfax's lab...

1129
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,750
and now this!

1130
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,370
- You were in Benderfax's lab?

1131
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:36,750
- Farance...

1132
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,340
what do you know about the lab?

1133
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,300
- My place is not too far up here...

1134
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,720
You can hide the car there
for awhile, if you want to.

1135
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,560
(music fades)

1136
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,110
- Nice closet, Farance.

1137
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,480
- [man's voice] Dog data! No...No...

1138
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,530
- [Andrew] What was that?

1139
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,900
- Blitz.

1140
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,490
- [Blitz] Dog...Dog...Dog...

1141
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,360
- Whoa, hold on. You mean the guy
who broke into Benderfax's lab?

1142
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,240
- Uh huh.

1143
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,450
(Blitz mumbling)

1144
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,440
- [Andrew] He's up there?

1145
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,290
- [Blitz] No...No...

1146
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,450
- Yeah...

1147
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,750
You go on up...

1148
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:18,210
I'm gonna wait down here...
if you don't mind.

1149
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,130
- [Blitz] No...No...

1150
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,500
(papers rustling)

1151
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,220
- Blitz?
- [Blitz] Dog...data...

1152
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,760
Can you hand me that notebook over there?

1153
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,100
- Yeah...

1154
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,060
Which one?

1155
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:36,100
- 21...The one sticking out...number 21...

1156
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,730
No...dogs...dogs...dogs...

1157
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,840
Dog data!

1158
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,220
This is nothing but dog data!

1159
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,490
I've wasted a whole afternoon on this!

1160
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,610
Did you want something, or what?

1161
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:49,110
- Blitz...

1162
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:51,240
- I know what Benderfax is doing in his lab...
- [Blitz] No...no...

1163
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,020
I found one of my patients...
mutilated on his operating table!

1164
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,660
- No...no...

1165
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,580
- Blitz!

1166
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,900
Blitz, I need your help...

1167
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,420
You have evidence against Benderfax...

1168
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,340
the notes that you took out of his lab!

1169
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,550
(suspenseful music)

1170
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,860
Blitz...

1171
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,400
What'd you find out in these lab notes?

1172
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,270
I mean...

1173
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,320
What's Benderfax doing down there?
Who's involved? Martin? Clench?

1174
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,990
- Nurse Clench...

1175
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,660
She assisted Dr. Benderfax
in his research, for years...

1176
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,250
In one experiment, Nurse Clench...

1177
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,830
amputated the arms and legs of...

1178
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:38,370
mother chimps with newborn babies...
to see how they'd cope...emotionally...

1179
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:41,040
Grief studies...yeah...
They called 'em grief studies!

1180
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,050
Nurse Clench repeated
the experiment for a year...

1181
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,050
and it was a complete success!

1182
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,850
Consistently, the babies died of neglect...

1183
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,800
and the mothers became catatonic...
and died of starvation...

1184
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,590
despite intravenous feeding...

1185
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:55,100
That bitch helped take the study of grief
right into the 21st Century!

1186
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,020
Something to be proud of...don't you think?

1187
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,560
(suspenseful music)

1188
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,000
- Blitz...what about human experiments?

1189
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:25,630
- Human subjects are not readily available
for Benderfax's types of experiments...

1190
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,710
That's why he took over the East Hill
Mental Hospital, 10 years ago...

1191
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,130
and changed the name
to the Benderfax Institute...

1192
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:35,510
It gave him a virtual warehouse
of societal rejects to choose from...

1193
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,100
He had control of their records...

1194
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,890
and nobody seems to miss 'em...

1195
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:41,440
Wow! What a great setup!

1196
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,440
(suspenseful music)

1197
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,380
- So, he's definitely
experimenting on the patients?

1198
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,000
- Oh...Well that's all he does...

1199
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,500
I mean, he keeps a few
dogs and cats around...

1200
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,760
just in case the state inspector
might want to check out the facility...

1201
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,990
I mean, he fakes all the
animal research data...

1202
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:16,990
to keep the grant money rolling in...

1203
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,720
You can't run a lab without cash...

1204
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,560
You can't run a lab without cash!

1205
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,070
You got a cigarette Doctor?

1206
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,850
(loud crash)

1207
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,360
(tense music)

1208
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,370
- Hey, Farance...

1209
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,280
I want to talk to you about this...

1210
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,290
(electric guitar song)

1211
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,330
I thought we were friends, Farance...

1212
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,670
Is that the way you treat a friend?

1213
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,670
Bash 'em in the skull
with a frigging baseball bat?

1214
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,010
I don't think so, Farance...

1215
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:59,850
I think I need to square
this situation up, Farance...

1216
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,860
It's only fair...Don't you think?

1217
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,600
Don't you agree...
I have reasonable cause to want to...

1218
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,480
blow your frigging head off...
You little freak?

1219
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,480
[Martin] I know you're here, Farance.

1220
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,490
- [Farance] Come on...

1221
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,740
- [Martin] I can hear you pissing your pants!

1222
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,450
- [Farance] Bastard...

1223
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,160
(rattling door handle)

1224
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,860
- Found you, you little shit!

1225
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,700
(gasps)

1226
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,540
(bat thuds to floor)

1227
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,330
Geez, Farance!

1228
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,230
What a pitiful little pansy!

1229
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,790
(Blitz laughs)

1230
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,090
- Laugh it up, fuzz-ball!

1231
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,220
(gun shots)

1232
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,220
Jesus Christ!

1233
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,090
(tense music)

1234
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,860
[Martin] Weird...

1235
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,990
(phone rings)

1236
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,250
- Benderfax...

1237
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:08,250
- Doc...I tailed Farance, like you told me to....

1238
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,420
Turns out that little freak's been
hiding Clarence Blitz up in his attic...

1239
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,880
Looks like he's been living
up there for quite awhile.

1240
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:16,300
- Really?

1241
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,260
How very convenient...

1242
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,830
I assume you've...spoken with them both?

1243
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:21,850
- Yeah, Doc...
I assume you've...spoken with them both?

1244
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,010
- Yeah, Doc...

1245
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,680
I gave 'em both a real good talking to.

1246
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,890
- Splendid...

1247
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:31,520
And have you by any chance come
across our young Dr. March, today?

1248
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,770
- March?

1249
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,610
No...

1250
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:34,690
Not yet...

1251
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,190
But don't you worry, Doc...

1252
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,990
I'll find that pencil neck.

1253
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,150
- You just did, asshole!

1254
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,030
(bat thuds)

1255
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:42,200
(loud crash)

1256
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,830
Benderfax!

1257
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,580
You've gone too far this time!

1258
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,000
- I'd like to speak to you at leisure, Doctor...

1259
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,750
but you see, I'm presently in a
meeting with one of my nurses...

1260
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,710
Carmen Snow...

1261
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,050
Perhaps you've met...

1262
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,090
You're very welcome to
drop by my lab sometime...

1263
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:02,050
and we can continue this
discussion in person...

1264
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,260
Goodbye, Doctor.

1265
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,060
- Carmen! Carmen!

1266
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,850
- Well, now...

1267
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:11,140
Where were we, my dear?

1268
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,820
- Farance...

1269
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,980
(groans)

1270
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,700
Don't move.

1271
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,830
(groans)

1272
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,290
- It's very kind of you, Carmen...

1273
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:37,340
to want to spare my feelings...

1274
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,420
but you must try to understand...

1275
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,030
that Andrew March is a
loathsome, conniving man...

1276
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:46,260
with no sense of morality, whatsoever...

1277
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:50,100
He would do absolutely
anything to destroy me...

1278
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,630
even becoming close to you, Carmen...

1279
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,690
with the intention of manipulating
your opinions of me...

1280
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:01,400
Andrew did try to turn you against me...

1281
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,570
Isn't that true?

1282
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,490
- Andrew said that he went
into your laboratory...

1283
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,700
He said that he found the
new patient, Wilma...

1284
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:12,080
mutilated on the operating table.

1285
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,290
- I see.

1286
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,670
- He said that she had been operated on...
while she was still alive...

1287
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:19,210
that you had been experimenting on her...
(suspenseful music)

1288
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,420
I'm sorry, Sir...

1289
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,510
I know I should I have told you before...

1290
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,590
I'm so sorry.

1291
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,850
- Here you are, my dear.

1292
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:29,100
- Thank you, Sir.

1293
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,210
- That's a good girl...

1294
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,900
Go ahead and get it all out.

1295
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,570
- I didn't believe him, Dr. Benderfax...

1296
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:40,190
I hope you believe me...

1297
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,570
I know you would have
never done those things.

1298
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:45,030
- No...Of course not, Carmen...

1299
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,660
Of course not...

1300
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:51,100
If only I had more employees...
as loyal as you, Carmen...

1301
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:54,870
You're truly an asset to the Institute...

1302
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:58,880
I'm very proud to have hired you.

1303
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,590
- Thank you, Dr. Benderfax...

1304
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,670
I'm happy that you feel that way.

1305
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,680
- Oh...I do, Carmen....

1306
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,810
I truly do...

1307
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,970
(dramatic music)

1308
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,920
(suspenseful music)

1309
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,950
- [Benderfax] I'm truly sorry
it's come to this, my dear...

1310
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,160
but you've been conspiring against me...

1311
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,030
and I simply cannot be expected...

1312
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,120
to tolerate this kind of disloyalty...

1313
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,460
from a member of my own staff...

1314
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:38,630
Oh...I've seen you whispering in the corridors...

1315
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:41,040
with that deviant, Farance Wur...

1316
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:42,880
and you made no secret of your...

1317
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,220
extracurricular activities with Dr. March...

1318
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,050
Did you think I couldn't put...

1319
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:51,050
two and two together?

1320
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:54,100
(dramatic music)

1321
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,200
(machinery beeps)
(suspenseful music)

1322
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,950
Subject K27...white female...
age 24...excellent health...

1323
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:13,740
For this subject I've
placed the sensor probes...

1324
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:17,410
behind the ocular orbits in an attempt...
to reduce brain activity interference...

1325
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:19,370
encountered in previous operations...

1326
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:22,500
There is minor bleeding...
but minimal tissue damage...

1327
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,670
If all goes well...Carmen's pretty eyes...

1328
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,800
will not be harmed in any way.

1329
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
(dramatic music)

1330
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,270
Larry...What are you doing?
(all yelling)

1331
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,270
Get...Get off!
(all yelling)

1332
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,070
Larry! Get...
(all yelling)

1333
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,990
(all yelling)

1334
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,070
Get off me! No!
(all yelling)

1335
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:52,280
Let...go! Get off!
(all yelling)

1336
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,070
(all yelling)

1337
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,750
Larry!

1338
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:05,880
(tense music)

1339
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,340
(breaths heavily)

1340
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,510
- Oh, flesh....

1341
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:20,850
the bliss of it...

1342
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,650
- Dr. Benderfax...

1343
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:25,450
Where are you?

1344
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,230
- I'm right here, Carmen.

1345
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:30,110
- What's happening?

1346
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,240
- My dear...

1347
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,780
the time has come for us
to get to know each other...

1348
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:38,200
in a more intimate way.

1349
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,580
(dramatic music)

1350
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,540
(machinery beeps)
(tense music)

1351
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:50,420
(breaths heavily)

1352
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,340
Oh, Carmen...

1353
01:12:56,390 --> 01:13:00,270
Wonderfully healthy organs...

1354
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:02,060
(sighs)

1355
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,440
(dramatic music)

1356
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,240
(machinery beeps)
(tense music)

1357
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,280
(ethereal music)

1358
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,290
Can you feel it, Carmen?

1359
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:23,120
The Telefaximial Field...(gasps)

1360
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,040
It's incredible...

1361
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,590
It's beautiful...

1362
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:34,340
(ethereal music)

1363
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,010
(machine loudly prints)

1364
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,180
(music fades)

1365
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,140
(laughs)

1366
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,520
Fantastic!

1367
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,140
Exactly as I visualized it!

1368
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,610
- You bastard...What have you done?

1369
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:34,360
- Andrew, you won't believe all that's
happened, since we last spoke.

1370
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,700
- You lousy--

1371
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,490
- This isn't a pair of forceps, Andrew...

1372
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:39,560
so please stay where you are.

1373
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,240
- You'll never get away with this, Benderfax!

1374
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,490
- Oh, but I will, Andrew...

1375
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,410
You see, I've just made the
greatest breakthrough of my career...

1376
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:46,830
You see that printout?

1377
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,630
It's my dog...Boxy!

1378
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,250
A perfect reproduction of
my own visualized thought...

1379
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,760
telepathically transmitted from my brain...

1380
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,840
to Carmen's interior organs...

1381
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,550
then relayed from her brain
to these probes...

1382
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:02,540
which feeds the telepathic
data to my computer here...

1383
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,430
which first amplifies, then
reproduces my thought picture...

1384
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:08,270
into hard copy form...
and there you have it...

1385
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,650
Boxy!

1386
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,610
I've finally done it!

1387
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:15,030
I've achieved true
telepathic Telefacsimile!

1388
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:17,950
- So you have been killing your patients...

1389
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,740
and now you've done this to Carmen...

1390
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,240
just so you can send a psychic...

1391
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,580
FAX of your dog?!?

1392
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,910
- You idiot...

1393
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:28,540
You're just like all the others
who criticize my work....

1394
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,670
You suffer from
chronic short sightedness....

1395
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,630
You attack me...
because I'm willing to do...

1396
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:35,170
whatever it takes
to reach a scientific goal...

1397
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,670
You know that I have achieved...

1398
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,930
what you and the others like you
could never achieve...

1399
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,220
Admit it...

1400
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,760
You're jealous of me and my breakthrough!

1401
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,350
- You are a sick, twisted bastard, Benderfax...

1402
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,270
and you can bet...that this...this...

1403
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,690
breakthrough is going to be your last! --

1404
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,690
- Andrew...

1405
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,570
- Carmen...

1406
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:56,940
(dramatic music)

1407
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,840
(gun shot)
(tense music)

1408
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,160
(Andrew's blood squirts)

1409
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,240
- Andrew...

1410
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,080
Andrew...

1411
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,370
- It's too bad, Andrew...

1412
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:12,080
I honestly liked you...

1413
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:16,000
I had even hoped we might
someday work together...

1414
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,090
(tense music)

1415
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,670
Sorry, Andrew...

1416
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:22,680
but I'm afraid it's sacrifice time...

1417
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,220
(Benderfax gasps)

1418
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:28,520
Lavinia...why?

1419
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,140
- I'm sorry, Thomas...

1420
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,270
(thuds to floor)

1421
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,110
This is all your fault, you know...

1422
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:39,070
You should never have come here...

1423
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,610
He's a brilliant scientist...
(Andrew's blood squirts)

1424
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,780
a true visionary...
(Andrew's blood squirts)

1425
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,620
You've no right to judge him...
(Andrew's blood squirts)

1426
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,240
not by this...

1427
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:49,500
He was never evil...

1428
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,460
just ahead of his time...

1429
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,330
There's a difference!

1430
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:56,460
(Andrew's blood squirts)

1431
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,670
(thuds to floor)
(Andrew's blood squirts)

1432
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:03,050
(sad piano music)

1433
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,390
For these past 10 years, I've taken
care of everything for you, Thomas...

1434
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,930
chosen the best test subjects...

1435
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,520
altered their records...

1436
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,270
even dealt with their remains...
when you'd finished with them...

1437
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,730
I did it all...

1438
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:20,570
because I believed the work you
were doing here was important, and...

1439
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,990
because I love you, Thomas...

1440
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:28,030
I have from the beginning, you know...

1441
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:30,870
Though, you've rarely had a kind word for me...

1442
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:32,790
or my ideas...

1443
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,380
Remember those grief studies
we did, years ago?

1444
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,800
They were my idea, weren't they?

1445
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,960
I even won a grant to do them...

1446
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,470
but you didn't care...

1447
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:45,090
You had to tell me...

1448
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:48,600
that amputating the arms and legs
of 200 mother chimps...

1449
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,680
was a stupid idea...

1450
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,270
after I'd already done it!

1451
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,520
Still...

1452
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,520
I've remained loyal to you
all these years, Thomas...

1453
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,270
but lately...

1454
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:02,590
things have got out of hand...

1455
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,070
and what we're doing here...

1456
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:07,240
just doesn't feel right anymore...

1457
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,300
so I'm going to make it right...

1458
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:14,120
I know you can never
forgive me for this, Thomas...

1459
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,330
but I can live with that.

1460
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,460
(whirring drill)
(tense music)

1461
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,590
(music and drill fade)

1462
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,750
- Well, you folks wanted to see Benderfax.

1463
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,480
- Has he spoken yet, Detective?

1464
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,200
- Not a word, since the incident, a month ago.

1465
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:48,280
- What's gonna happen to them now...

1466
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,240
Benderfax and Nurse Clench?

1467
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,410
- Don't worry, Doctor...

1468
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,660
We got enough evidence to
keep them out of circulation...

1469
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,540
for a very...very long time...

1470
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,880
Not that Benderfax is
gonna be much of a threat...

1471
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,420
after what Nurse Clench did to him.

1472
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:05,050
- Did she say why she did it, Detective?

1473
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:08,050
- Uh...Something about a chimp experiment...

1474
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:10,220
I couldn't make much sense of it...

1475
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:12,010
Oh, Doctor...

1476
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,920
did I tell ya the good news?

1477
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,850
- What? What news?

1478
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,850
- You're aware that Benderfax
faked the animal experiments...

1479
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:21,100
hadn't done any for years, right?

1480
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,940
Well, after we picked up Benderfax...

1481
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,820
I checked the Institutes kennels...

1482
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,360
and there he was...

1483
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,740
Murphy!

1484
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,990
- Who?

1485
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:31,530
- Murphy, my dog.

1486
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:34,200
- Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah...Murphy.

1487
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,100
- Boy, was he glad to see me...

1488
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:38,460
Of course, he was understandably distraught...

1489
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:41,540
but...uh...no worse for wear...

1490
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,050
Here, look...I have a Polaroid of him.

1491
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,550
- I'm glad that you got
your dog back, Detective...

1492
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,720
- I just wish I could have
stopped Benderfax...

1493
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,640
before he got to Katherine
and Vincent Grider...and...

1494
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,230
all the other victims...

1495
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:04,360
I feel like we were
helping him the whole time!

1496
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,940
- Andrew, don't talk like that...

1497
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,530
There's nothing we could have done...

1498
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:12,370
At least it's over, now.

1499
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:14,410
- Yeah, I guess it is...

1500
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,950
for Benderfax, anyway!

1501
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,950
(blood-chilling music)

1502
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,330
- [Benderfax] Morons!

1503
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:25,840
(dramatic music)
(laboratory machinery beeps)
