00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,750
Listen, I don't want the
kids to hear us. Let me just...

178
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,360
What are you talking about?

179
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,880
Look, Jake, I've never been comfortable
hiding our intentions.

180
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,960
Look, Katie is happy here.
She loves Andrew and Michael.

181
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,530
I mean, you should see the way the three...

182
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,690
Katie is my daughter!

183
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,330
Well, yeah, of course she is.
But we're very comfortable.

184
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,850
Staying at St. Francis for a year,

185
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,850
I imagine you ran through
most of your money.

186
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,860
You could see her
whenever you want,

187
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,180
and this is gonna free you up
to concentrating on your...

188
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,740
- Katie!
- Jake.

189
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,020
- Come on, we're going.
- BOTH: Jake! Jake!

190
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,390
JAKE: Potato Chip.

191
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,550
So I thought we rehearsed this.

192
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,470
- He killed my sister, not yours.

- Thank you.

- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

- Studying.

graduating degree in psychology,

201
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,560

whine about their problems all day.

202
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
I like helping people.

203
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,760
You can help me.

204
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm lonely as hell.

205
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,080
What could I possibly do
to help you, Evan?

206
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,210
I don't know. We could go out
for a date sometime.

207
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,210
You're a confident man, huh?

208
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,010
Am I? I think so.

209
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,810
So tell me,
what do you really want?

210
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,490
Do you wanna date me,
or do you wanna fuck me?

211
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,420

No, man.

217
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,460
Why'd you do that if you don't
wanna see me again?

218
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,460
I didn't have time
to work out today. (LAUGHS)

219
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,030

All right.

223
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
A case just got transferred to us.

224
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,450
A 12 year old girl.

225
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,090
Lucy Carter.

226
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,130
Her father died when she was an infant.
Drug overdose.

227
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,460
His mother was a prostitute
murdered by a John almost a year ago.

228
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,860
Where's she living?

229
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,500
Foster parents on 133rd.

230
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,980
She hasn't spoken a word
since her mother's funeral.

231
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,510
She hasn't spoken for a year?

232
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,150
How was her speaking before?

233
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,630
Just normal.

234
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,470
Any physiological?

235
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,550
Not a thing.

236
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,680
Thought you might be interested.

237
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,080
Definitely.

238
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,560
Good.

239
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,330
Which one's your favorite?

240
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,770
You can just point.

241
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,290
I like the cat.
But that's just me.

242

Lucy, I know you're scared.

243
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,070
But you're in a really
safe place, okay?

244

There's nothing.

It's like... It's an empty well.
It's...

254
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,270
just dry and barren.

255
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,870
Is that why you sleep with all these men?

256

- No.
- So what is it you want?

257
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,430
- I don't want anything.
- Well, you must want something,

258

- No!
- So what?

264
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,610
It makes me feel...

265
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,460
It makes me feel... something,

266
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,660
because most of the time
I feel nothing.

267
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,060
And these are men that
you don't even like.

268
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,420
Right.

269
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,230
So what would you do if you met a man
that you actually did like?

270
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,790
I don't know.

271

No way!
I got a buddy over there..

who's just shooting pools
also studying psychology.

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,090
she's a very experienced
psychologist.

350
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,060
I just need more time.

351
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,460
And I need something to put
into her sixty-day report.

352
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,220
Look, this isn't about trying
to impress the state agency

353
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,390
that just so happens to fund us
at a time of severe cutbacks.

354
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,390
It's about helping this little girl...

355
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,430
who's suffered such severe trauma
she can't even speak anymore,

356
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,400
and will live an unbearably bleak life
if we don't connect with her, and soon.

357
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,520
Now we've failed her,
and we have to fix it.

358
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
We've not failed her.

359
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,610
Katie, you're a very
bright young woman.

360
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,010
You're gonna be an exceptional
psychologist someday.

361
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,330
But you need to know when
to admit defeat, and move on.

362
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,900

- There's no environment, as therapist.

364

You know we can't let you take her off grounds.
But you got your week.

365
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,670
Thanks.

366
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,790

I just wanna tell you again
how sorry we all are about Patricia.

big loss for our whole community.

- Yeah?

When she left Copen, she moved in
with her aunt and uncle?

379
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,590
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

380
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,470
- But she's back with me now.
- Oh, good, good.

381
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,280
And, uh... I would really like her
to come back to Copen.

382

Well, it's the middle of the year,
you know.

383

Do you really think pulling her out of
Worthington is the best thing right now?

384
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,360
I already did.

Oh! Uh... Gosh!

to have Katie back with us,

- The faculty get priority for admission.

budgeted for something like that.

Okay, you really wanna teach
creative writing to 12th graders?

I really want my daughter
to go to Copen.

for the college applications?

then talent them.

01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,640
Yeah.

874
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,600
Yeah. Maybe a million,
if I stop eating hot dogs.

875
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,840
Daddy?

876
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,290
I will be such an old man, all right?

877
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,810
You'll have your own house
and your own husband.

878
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,090
You'll have a whole
bunch of kids.

879
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,850
You'll have a dog and a cat

880
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:38,970
and everybody will be running around
putting ketch-up on everything.

881
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,860
Promise.

882
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,940
I promise.

883
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,510
Pinky swear?

884
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,110
Pinky swear.

885
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,880
MAN: Jake Davis?

886
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,760
Yeah.

887
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,690
You've been served.

888
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,490
I have to admit I was shocked
when Bob shared your case with me.

889
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:22,380
It's unprecedented for an aunt and uncle
to sue for the custody of their niece

890
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,580
when the biological father
is not only alive and well.

891
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,740
The famous author of The Boot.

892
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,630
Jake, John Wilton is the best
custody lawyer in the country.

893
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,750
I can't tell you how happy
I am he sent us your case.

894
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:40,360
Sometimes these cases more about hurt feelings
than a geniune desire to obtain custody.

895
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,840
First step is for you to sit down with William,
try and talk him out of pursuing this.

896
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,480
And if he refuses to drop it?

897
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,530
We'll file a motion to dismiss,

898
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,850
argue the case is completely without merit.

899
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,010
And if that fails?

900
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,210
We'll kick their ass in court.

901
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,790
Jake.

902
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,870
Scotch, neat.

903
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,030
WAITER: Right away, sir.

904
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,480
I'll start.

905
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,210
Look, I want you to know it's
not a vendetta against you.

906
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,410
We don't blame you for
what happened to Patricia

907
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:39,050
and we're not retaliating
because you kept Katie

908
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:43,020
away from us after we took care
of her for a year in your absence.

909
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,420
Our only concern is Katie's welfare.

910
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,550
And if you asked her, she tells you in a
heartbeat she wants to stay with me?

911
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,910
Well, she's eight.

912
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,590
It's inadmissible in court.

913
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,510
It still matters.

914
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,800
You're a reasonable man, William.

915
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,200
And you're a father.

916
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,370
I know that in your heart you
know what you're doing is wrong.

917
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:18,410
Now I admit, I was angry
when I came to pick up Katie

918
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,580
and you talked of adopting her
out from under me.

919
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:27,180
And perhaps, at the party
I overreacted.

920
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,390
Perhaps, you overreacted?

921
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:35,430
I'm truly sorry for what
happened at Elizabeth's party.

922
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:37,670
You provoked me,

923
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,760
but that still doesn't
justify my action.

924
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:48,400
And I would welcome
you and Elizabeth

925
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,810
being more involved
in Katie's life.

926
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,570
Jake, I...

927
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,810
Hey, I didn't file the lawsuit
as a bargaining chip.

928
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:59,530
You know my lawyer John Wilton.

929
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,580
He's a great attorney.

930
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,580
He's not cheap.

931
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,420
He tells me you
don't have a shot.

932
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:12,430
He tells me they'll never separate a
daughter from her sole biological parent.

933
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,830
You know you're gonna
lose, why do this?

934
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,830
You spent a year in a mental institution
which did nothing

935
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,960
to relieve you of your
psychotic breaks.

936
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,560
3 dozen people witnessed you attack me
in my home at a birthday party

937
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,890
'cause I didn't like your last book.

938
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:33,810
You gave testimony to the Connecticut
state police that you were having

939
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,850
a heated argument and speeding
at the time of your wife's death

940
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,780
and while they didn't charge you
with reckless endangerment

941
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:43,940
that is how it's gonna appear
to the custody judge.

942
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,260
Your last book tanked,

943
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,870
critically and commercially,
putting into doubt

944
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:53,150
whether or not you can even
provide for Katie.

945
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,390
And I've got a feeling
you're running out of money.

946
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:00,920
But I'll know soon enough when I
subpoena you for national records.

947
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,040
I got more money than God.

948
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,730
If we lose, we'll appeal.

949
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:13,010
If we lose the appeal,
we'll appeal that.

950
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,900
How are you positioned to handle
a prolonged legal battle?

951
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,340
You are a very good
lawyer, William.

952
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,590
I'm trying to be a
very good uncle.

953
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:34,790
No, what you're trying to do?

954
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,870
Is you're trying to separate
a little girl

955
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,320
who's already suffering deeply
from the loss of her mother,

956
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,760
away from the father she loves

957
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,480
and who loves her.

958
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,600
That is what you're trying to do.

959
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:54,490
I would hope there's a special place in hell
for somebody who would do that.

960
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:58,170
(CAMERON & KATIE LAUGHING)

961
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,220
That did not actually happen!

962
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,100
- No, impossible.
- Yes, it did.

963
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,460
- Really?
- Yes.

964
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,220
Wow.

965
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,060
- We need a drink.
- Okay.

966
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,100
- You want another one? Yeah?
- Yes, please.

967
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,220
Okay. I'll be...

968
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,550
(LAUGHS) I'll be back.

969
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,030
JOHN: Hey.

970
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:16,990
Hi.

971
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,230
How you doing?

972
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,840
Okay.

973
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,160
You look beautiful.

974
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
Thanks.

975
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,200
You don't remember me, do you?

976
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,520
Yes, I do.

977
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,800
What's my name?

978
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,480
- Um...
- It's John.

979
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,250
We met at Walker's Pub,

980
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,090
like a year ago, you remember that?
We had drinks.

981
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:34,970
Right.

982
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,330
Do you still have that place with
that incredible view of the park?

983
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,090
I do.

984
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,340
- Really?
- Yes, same place.

985
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,740
let's go there, tonight.

986
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,460
Okay. You see, actually,
I gotta tell you someone is sitting there

987
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,540
and I need you to...

988
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,060
You had fun, didn't you?

989
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,910
Listen, can you go?

990
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,270
I mean, 'cause he's gonna be
right back, and...

991
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:56,190
All right. You're like one of those girls
who just into the one night thing.

992
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,030
Right? Is that you?

993
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,630
Can you go, please?

994
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,720
Well, I just... I don't give a shit.
I can pay you for it.

995
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,920
- All right. Here, I'll help you.
- You want a hundred?

996
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,920
Come on, thanks.

997
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,720
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, man.

998
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,600
You know what, you're a bitch.

999
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,560
Here you go.
Just take that with you.

1000
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,600
You take that, bitch.

1001
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,960
CAMERON:
What's going on?

1002
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,050
She's a one night kind of girl.

1003
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,490
And tonight's your night,

1004
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,650
so enjoy.

1005
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,090
'Cause I did.

1006
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:20,900
Who's this guy?

1007
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,380
JOHN: You know I banged you
on your kitchen floor,

1008
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,260
you could at least
remember my goddamn name.

1009
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,070
You want a hundred?

1010
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,190
Get out of here!

1011
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,150
Get your hands off me.

1012
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:35,230
- Get out of here!
- Get your...

1013
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,070
Get out!

1014
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,450
You ever hear you thought you were
getting potato chip

1015
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,810
and you wind up with some
cheap piece of ass.

1016
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,580
Hey, stop that.

1017
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:01,380
No.

1018
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,380
Kate, the woman I'm crazy about
isn't Potato Chip, it's you Katie.

1019
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,260
Okay? You.

1020
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,430
Well...

1021
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:28,600
There are ways that I came up
to help me cope with

1022
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,650
my situation in life that
I know aren't healthy.

1023
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:36,730
I know they're not good for me.

1024
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:42,300
(STAMMERING)
but, it helped me fill this void.

1025
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,740
And you know what?
I'm like pretty shamed of...

1026
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,380
CAMERON:
Hey, Kate, come here.

1027
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,820
It... It's not....

1028
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,950
Come here, okay?

1029
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:02,520
Hey, all that is just
behind you now, alright?

1030
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,360
Yeah.

1031
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,920
These cupcakes are
really something.

1032
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,650
I'm really ridiculous.

1033
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,250
I'm trying to feel
sick but it's worth it.

1034
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,570
(CHUCKLES)
It's so worth it.

1035
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,130
Oh.

1036
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:17,090
Hey, um...

1037
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:20,460
So it's my mom's birthday
this week,

1038
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:26,660
and my dad is throwing her a dinner
Saturday night up in Greenwich.

1039
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,550
You wanna go?

1040
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,550
Really?

1041
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,230
Yeah.

1042
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,190
Only if you want to.

1043
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,270
It'll be fun.

1044
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,440
Okay.

1045
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,280
Yeah?

1046

1402
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,840
Katie.

1403
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:36,990
It is a great honor to accept this Pulitzer
on behalf of my client, the late Jake Davis.

1404
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:41,360
That Fathers and Daughters
has won every major literary award

1405
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,360
and been perched to top
the best sellers' list for a year

1406
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,280
is every agent's dream.

1407
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:52,890
That I never got to buy Jake a drink
and slap him on the back

1408
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:55,530
is my own personal nightmare.

1409
01:46:57,050 --> 01:47:00,980
Katie, I think you're the only person in the world
who will miss him more than I will.

1410
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:04,820
- Thank you. Thank you.

1412
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,690
ELIZABETH:
I've had a hard life.

1413
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:39,130
I suppose I was hard right back.

1414
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:45,220
I'm a grown woman
who's never known love.

1415
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:48,220
Isn't that something?

1416
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:57,030
My parents were just the same,

1417
01:47:57,070 --> 01:48:00,200
my mother was a terribly mean woman.

1418
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:06,480
And my father, someone we saw
at the occasional Sunday dinner.

1419
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,450
You know Katie.

1420
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:13,770
Men...

1421
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:16,610
...they can survive without love.

1422
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:20,740
but not us women.

1423
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:05,900
Come here.
