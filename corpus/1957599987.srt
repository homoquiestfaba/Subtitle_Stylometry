00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,198
SO, WHAT ABOUT AIDS?

174
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,066
AREN'T YOU AFRAID?

175
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,535
IT'S MY ONLY CHANCE TO PLAY
HERO.

176
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,439
( people talking quietly )
 IF YOU DON'T STOP SMOKING,

177
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,819
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE.

178
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,156
WELL, HERE I AM, FOUGHT FOR
MY COUNTRY, YOU FOREIGNERS COME

180
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,228
I'M GONNA WRITE MY CONGRESSMAN.

181
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,331
YOU DO JUST THAT.

182
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,032
HEY, DOC.

183
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:51,437

184
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,405
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,543
HI, ABE.

186
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:02,214
OOPS. I MEAN, DR. VERGHESE.

187
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,949
IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

188
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:11,457
SADIE, CAN I HAVE A QUICK
WORD, PLEASE?

189
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,059
YOU SHOULD BE USING GLOVES.

190
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,395
YOU KNOW THE NEW RULES, DON'T
YOU?

191
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,898
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I KEEP
FORGETTIN'.

192
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,400
BESIDES, I CAN'T DRAW BLOOD WITH
GLOVES ON, 'CAUSE I CAN'T FEEL

193
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,601
ANYTHING.

194
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,204
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO LEARN,
SADIE.

195
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,438
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.

196
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,975
THERE IS NO AIDS AROUND HERE.

197
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,511
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT OLD
BLOWHARD.

198
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:38,484

OR HOMOSEXUAL TO YOU?

199
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,886
ABE!

200
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,055

204
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,501
WE HAVE AN AIDS EXPERT IN TOWN.

205
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,236
THERE'S SO MUCH IGNORANCE HERE.

206
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,105
AND WE'VE BEEN FEELIN' THE
PINCH.

207
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,374
FEWER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DONATIN'

208
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,276

209
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,048

I SHOW IT AGAIN?

212
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,224
ALL RIGHT, OLIVIA.

213
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,526
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GAY
POPULATION HERE?

214
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,996
WE OUGHTA SHOW THE TAPE AT
THE CONNECTION.

215
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,231
THANK YOU FOR REMINDIN' ME.

216
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,132
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

217
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,534
THE CONNECTION?

218
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,703
IT'S A GAY BAR.

219
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,306
( Indian music plays )
 I CAN'T DECIDE WHICH SHIRT

220
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,964

221
00:14:58,998 --> 00:14:59,832
THIS IS A SMALL TOWN.

222
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,501
WHAT IF ANYONE SEES YOU GO IN
THERE?

223
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,303
YOU KNOW WHY I'M GOING.

224
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,437
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MYSELF.

225
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,206
I'M TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

226
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,741
YOU KNOW HOW THEY TALK.

227
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,978
AND AS AN INDIAN, YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY INVISIBLE.

228
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,280
NO, NO, IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

229
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,448
I CAN'T LET OLIVIA DOWN.

230
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,550
HELP ME.

231
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,186
WHY BOTHER? GO NAKED.

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,480
THIS IS DR. ABRAHAM VERGHESE.

234

HE'S A SPECIALIST IN AIDS.

235
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,884
NOT EXACTLY.

236
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,553
MY SPECIALTY IS INFECTIOUS
DISEASES, AND AIDS HAPPENS TO

OF AN EXPERT THAN ANYBODY ELSE

239
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,326
IN THIS TOWN.

240
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,261
WHAT CAN I GET YOU TO DRINK?

241
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,630
COULD I HAVE SOME WATER,
PLEASE?

242
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,099

243
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,702

IT'S A BIG NAME WITH EVEN
BIGGER IMPLICATIONS.

249
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,596
WE WOULD ESTIMATE THERE ARE
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION PEOPLE

250
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,698
WHO'VE BEEN INFECTED WITH THE
VIRUS.

251
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,801
OUR FEAR, THAT WE MAY FACE AN
EPIDEMIC, IS CERTAINLY

252
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,103
JUSTIFIED.

253
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,139
THERE HAS BEEN A SUDDEN AND
RAPID SPREAD OF AIDS TO

254
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,341
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY.

255
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:54,346
SOME 50% OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE
DIED.

256
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:02,554
GENTLEMEN, AND LADIES,
I GIVE YOU DR. ABRAHAM VERGHESE.

257
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,191
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

258
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,427
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF
GETTIN' AIDS HERE IN JOHNSON

259
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,795
CITY?

260
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,564
IF YOU WEAR A CONDOM, IT
SHOULD BE EXTREMELY LOW.

261
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,434
WHAT IF YOU DON'T, OR YOU
HAVEN'T?

262
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,703
( giggling )
 IF YOU DON'T, IT DEPENDS UPON

263
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,607
HOW MANY OF YOUR PARTNERS WERE
INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS.

264
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,742
IT'S A BIT LIKE RUSSIAN
ROULETTE.

265
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,311
IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK, SAN
FRANCISCO, BOSTON, MOST OF THE

266
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:30,182

THEM.

267
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,419
IN JOHNSON CITY, I JUST DON'T
KNOW.

268
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:40,225
WELL, I MEAN, LET'S SAY YOU
WERE REAL CAREFUL, AND, UM...

269
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,163
AND YOU TRUSTED SOMEONE,
ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT

270
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:48,200
THAT SAME PERSON WAS CARRYING ON
WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY.

271
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:53,672
AND, UH, AND HE WAS THE ONLY
PERSON THAT YOU'D BEEN WITH.

272
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,374
IS HE HIV-POSITIVE?

273
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,475
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T KNOW.

274
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,211
HE LEFT FOR ATLANTA.

275
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:05,284
BUT LAST I HEARD, 
HE WAS... HE WAS SICK.

276
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,487
IN FACT, I THINK...

277
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,858
I THINK HE'S DEAD.

278
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:17,162
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE VIRUS
WAS RIGHT IN OUR MIDST.

279
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:22,868

HAVE TAKEN THE TEST?

280
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:27,573

CONFIDENTIAL.

LEST YE BE JUDGED."

"LOVE THY BROTHER AS THYSELF."

00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,186
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

343
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,654
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

344
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,656
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU TODAY?

345
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,959
THREE PACK OF CHILI PEPPER.

346
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,660
AND TWO KILO BASMATI RICE.

347
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,965
I GIVE YOU DISCOUNT ON FIVE
KILO.

348
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,533
HI, MAMA.

349
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,934
HI, GORGEOUS.

350
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,170
SEE HOW THE GENERATION HAS
CHANGED?

351
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,172
CAN I HAVE MY RICE, PLEASE, THAT
I ORDERED LAST WEEK?

352
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,541
Woman on answering machine:
DR. VERGHESE, THIS IS MATTIE

353
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,942
VINES FROM VIRGINIA.

354
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,212
I'M VERY UPSET ABOUT MY BROTHER
GORDON.

355
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,982
I'LL JUST BE REAL HONEST WITH
YOU.

356
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,550
GORDON HAS HIV FACTOR.

357
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:44,055
COULD YOU CALL ME AT HOME
AT 555-8009?

358
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,257
IT'S URGENT.

359
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,226
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

360
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,497
MY FIRST AIDS PATIENT IN
TENNESSEE IS ON HIS WAY.

361
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,534
MATTIE'S BROTHER.

362
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,572
ABRAHAM!

363
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,244
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD COME SEE
US SO QUICKLY.

364
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
MATTIE, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

365
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,749
I HEARD YOU WERE BACK IN
JOHNSON CITY, AND I SAW YOU ON

366
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,017
TV, THAT'S HOW I KNEW TO CALL.

367
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,920
I HEARD YOU WERE AT THE LAB
WHEN I GOT BACK, BUT I MISSED

368
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,154
YOU.

369
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,990
I WORK AT THE LAB CLOSE TO
HOME NOW, WHICH IS GOOD, NOW

370
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,091
THAT GORDON'S BACK.

371
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,894
LET ME COME STRAIGHT TO THE
POINT.

372
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,832
MY BROTHER GORDON'S BEEN SICK
A LONG TIME.

373
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,534
I MEAN, A VERY LONG TIME.

374
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,206
BUT HE IS REAL SICK TONIGHT.

375
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,745
SO WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU
CONTACTED THE VIRUS?

376
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,181
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

377
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:47,219
YOUR TEST SAYS OCTOBER, 1985,
BUT DO YOU THINK IT COULD'VE

378
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,653
BEEN BEFORE THAT?

379
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:54,292
I GUESS I MUSTA GOT THE VIRUS
IN '80 OR '81.

380
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,229
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
FEELING POORLY?

381
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,898
MONTHS. NO, YEARS.

382
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:04,669
I WAS SICK FOR SO LONG AND,
AND LOSIN' WEIGHT...

383
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,837
EVEN BEFORE I CAME HOME.

384
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,574
AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
FEELING SINCE YOU GOT HOME?

385
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,977
TIRED AND FEVERISH.

386
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,180
I STAY COLD ALL THE TIME,
AND THEN, I'LL SUDDENLY BREAK

387
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,048
A SWEAT.

388
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,618
OTHERWISE...

389
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:25,223
OTHERWISE, I'M DOIN' PRETTY
GOOD.

390
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,892
OKAY, GORDON.

391
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,661
I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE YOU NOW,
IF I MAY.

392
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,763
OKAY.

393
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,608
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADMIT
HIM.

394
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,078
HE'S ANEMIC, HE NEEDS
A TRANSFUSION, HE HAS YEAST IN

395
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:53,985
HIS MOUTH, AND I CAN HEAR RALES
IN BOTH LUNGS.

396
00:25:54,019 --> 00:26:01,726
HONEY, DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
A THING.

397
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,864
GORDON, I THINK YOU NEED
TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL.

398
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,633
I DON'T WANNA BE IN THE
HOSPITAL.

399
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:12,037
CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ME SOME
MEDICINE AND SEND ME HOME?

400
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,238
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

401
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,240
THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT.

402
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,909
YOU DO WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS.

403
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,010
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT GORDO.

404
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,913
WE'LL TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF
HIM.

405
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,849
I'LL COME BY AND SEE YOU IN
THE MORNING.

406
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,851
IN THE MEANTIME, GET SOME SLEEP.

407
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,253
I'M GONNA STAY RIGHT HERE.

408
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,722
I BROUGHT MY THINGS.

409
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:59,050
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN RIGHT
BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT MY

410
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,252
BREAST CANCER.

411
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,321
YOU HAD CANCER, MATTIE?

412
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:08,026
I BEAT IT, THANKS TO GOOD
LUCK AND THE GOOD LORD ABOVE.

413
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,465
I TELL YOU, BAD LUCK JUST HAS A
WAY OF STRIKIN' OUT OF THE BLUE.

414
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,034
WHEN GORDON CAME HOME, IT WAS
LIKE ANOTHER TEST GOD WAS

415
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,303
GIVIN' US.

416
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,840
IT'S LIKE HE'S SAYIN, "OKAY,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU ALL CAN DO

417
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,308
NOW."

418
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,011
AND I TELL YOU WHAT I'M GONNA
DO.

419
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,712
THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT.

420
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,849
I'M GONNA PLAY THE LORD'S HAND.

421
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,054
GORDON'S YOUR ONLY BROTHER,
RIGHT?

422
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,889
NO, THERE'S THREE OF US.

423
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,425
HERMAN'S THE OLDEST, HE WAS THE
HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHEN PA

424
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,261
WAS AWAY, THEN ME, THEN GORDO.

425
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,930
WE WERE TOUGH KIDS, HERMAN AND
ME.

426
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,833
ONLY GORDO WAS A SICKLY ONE.

427
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,936
POOR KID WAS IN AND OUT OF THE
HOSPITAL FROM THE TIME HE WAS

428
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,238
FOUR YEARS OLD.

429
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,842
HE HAD THE CROUP, HE HAD
BRONCHITIS.

430
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,079
AND HE HAD THEM FITS.

431
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,383
I THINK HE WAS 14 WHEN THE FITS
JUST WENT AWAY.

432
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,186
SUDDENLY, HE PUT ON INCHES.

433
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,789
HE DEVELOPED A STYLE.

434
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:19,097
HE BECAME THIS DAZZLING,
DAZZLING CREATURE.

435
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,400
IT WAS NOTHING SHORT OF 
A MIRACLE.

436
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:26,037
HE WAS A VERY GOOD-LOOKIN' YOUNG
MAN.

437
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:36,948
♪ THERE YOU ARE
LIKE A DREAM FROM AFAR

438
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:47,859
NO OTHER VISION WILL DO
MY ONLY PASSION IS YOU

439
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:59,137
EVEN WHEN I'M FEELIN' BLUE
THERE YOU ARE ♪

440
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,406
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

441
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:05,977
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE
YOU TO MEET THE TWO PEOPLE IN

442
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,413
THIS WORLD WHO HAVE MADE MY LIFE
WORTH LIVIN'.

443
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:14,285
MATTIE, MY SISTER, AND MY MA...

444
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,088
VISITIN' US ALL THE WAY FROM
PREACHER'S CREEK, VIRGINIA.

445
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:29,167
( applause and cheering )
 DANCE WITH ME, MATTIE.

446
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,140
ONE YEAR, GORDO DID NOT CALL
ON MOTHER'S DAY.

447
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:40,044
THEN MAMA'S BIRTHDAY CAME AND
WENT, AND STILL NO CALL.

448
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:44,949
IT WAS LIKE HE JUST DISAPPEARED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

449
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:52,257
FOR FIVE YEARS, WE DID NOT KNOW
WHETHER HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE.

450
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,095
( woman humming )
 ( gasps )

451
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,911
HEY, MATTIE.

452
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,314
WHAT YOU DOIN'?

453
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,117
MA!

454
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,887
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

455
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:27,158
WHY HAVE YOU NOT CALLED
ALL THESE YEARS?

456
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:33,531
( Gordon laughing )
 MA! MA!

457
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:38,002
MAMA, I'VE COME HOME.

458
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,312
Mother: THANK YOU, LORD.

459
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:56,421
( Gordon laughs )
 GORDON?

460
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,990
HEY, PA.

461
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,334
HALLELUJAH.

462
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,081
OH, OH, MATTIE, LOOK WHAT
I GOT YOU, LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.

463
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:27,318
( Mattie exclaims
wordlessly )

464
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,686
Mother: PRAISE THE LORD!

465
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,523
PRAISE THE LORD!

466
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,002
DANCE WITH ME.

467
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,719
GORDON, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

468
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,254
SHOULD I CALL THE DOCTOR?

469
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,555
NO, I'M OKAY.

470
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,124
OF COURSE HE'S ALL RIGHT.

471
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:09,060
HE'S JUST TIRED FROM ALL THAT
TRAVELIN'.

472
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:13,064
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO PUT
SOME FLESH ON HIM.

473
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,334
I KNOW I AIN'T BEEN MUCH OF
A FATHER, AIN'T BEEN AROUND

474
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,769
THAT MUCH.

475
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,306
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE HOME,
THINGS ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

476
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:25,677
WHAT THINK YOU, WHEN YOU GET
RESTED UP, WE GO INTO BUSINESS

477
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,078
TOGETHER.

478
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,614
I'VE BEEN THINKIN' ABOUT ROOFIN'
AND TILIN'.

479
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,482
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

480
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,320
YEAH. THAT'D BE GREAT.

481
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,623
MA.

482
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,059
THANK YOU, MA.

483
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,609
( weakly ) HEY, MATTIE.

484
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,079
WHAT YOU DOIN'?

485
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,381
FOR YOU.

486
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,251
YOU'RE ALWAYS COLD.

487
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:18,663
( breathing heavily )
MATTIE, I'M SICK.

488
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,632
CAN YOU HELP ME?

489
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,574
ANY CHANGE IN HIS FEVER?

490
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,677
NO, SIR.

491
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,245
WHAT'S THAT?

492
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:44,322
HE SAID HE LOVED CHOP SUEY,
SO I GOT HIM SOME.

493
00:33:44,322 --> 00:34:13,351
HE SAID HE LOVED CHOP SUEY,
SO I GOT HIM SOME.

494
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,187
COME ON, CLYDE.

495
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,259
( grunts )
OH.

496
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:25,329
NOW, LOOK, Y'ALL, JUST LOOK AT
HIM.

497
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:29,300
WOULD DEPRESSION OR NERVES
DO THIS TO A GROWN MAN?

498
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:34,338
WOULD THEY MAKE HIM LOSE WEIGHT,
HUH?

499
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,207
JUST LOOK AT HIM.

500
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,142
LOOK AT HIM!

501
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,179
WOULD NERVES MAKE HIM STOP
TALKIN' AND BECOME LIKE A BABY

502
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,882
OR LOSE WEIGHT OR HICCUP FOR
WEEKS?

503
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,485
COME ON, KIDS.

504
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,488
YOUR HUSBAND'S CAT SCAN
INDICATES A GLOBAL DETERIORATION

505
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,323
OF ALL COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS.

506
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,625
CAN YOU SPEAK IN PLAIN
ENGLISH?

507
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,562
IT MEANS HIS BRAIN HAS
SHRIVELED.

508
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,730
IT'S THE SORT OF THING WE FIND
IN 70-YEAR-OLD PATIENTS WITH

509
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,566
ALZHEIMER'S.

510
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,734
WELL, HONEY, I HATE TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE, BUT CLYDE'S

511
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,969
A 35-YEAR-OLD TRUCK DRIVER.

512
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,672
IT AIN'T LIKE SOMEBODY PUT HIS
BRAINS IN THE DRYER AND JUST

513
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,539
LEFT IT RUNNIN'.

514
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,909
HAS HE EVER USED INTRAVENOUS
DRUGS?

515
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,547
KIDS, WHY DON'T YOU WAIT ON
OUTSIDE?

516
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,649
THAT'S IT, GO ON.

517
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:22,553
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT THERE. GO ON.

518
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,322
NOW WHAT?

519
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,624
HAS HE EVER USED INTRAVENOUS
DRUGS?

520
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,193
NO, NO. HE JUST DRINKS.

521
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,462
HAS HE EVER HAD SEX WITH
ANOTHER MAN?

522
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,930
OH, HELL, NO.

523
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,765
HELL, YES.

524
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,234
WHAT?

525
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,669
YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH MEN?

526
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,804
YEP.

527
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,540
OH, HE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S
SAYIN'. THEY GOT HIM ALL

528
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,474
PUMPED UP.

529
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,675
I LIKE SEX, VICKIE.

530
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,643
YOU KNOW I DO.

531
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:49,680
WITH MEN? CLYDE? YOU LIKE
SEX WITH MEN?

532
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:50,915
YEP.

533
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,750
YOU TWO-TIMIN' PERVERT.

534
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,751
MRS. TALLEY.

535
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,687
YOU HAD SEX WITH MY SISTER,
TOO, DIDN'T YOU?

536
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,955
DIDN'T YOU?!

537
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,657
ANSWER ME, CLYDE.

538
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,426
DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW IT,
YOU TWO-TIMIN' SON OF A BITCH.

539
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,961
MRS. TALLEY, PLEASE.

540
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,232
PLEASE.

541
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,235
YOUR HUSBAND SHOWS SIGNS OF
AIDS-RELATED DEMENTIA,

542
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,639
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO TEST HIM TO
BE CERTAIN OF THAT.

543
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,543
I ALSO SUGGEST WE TEST YOU,
AND YOUR SISTER, AND ANYONE ELSE

544
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:23,681
YOU FEEL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

545
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,717
OKAY.

546
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,353
SHIT.

547
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,863
HAVE YOU WASHED YOUR HANDS?

548
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:43,634
YES, RAJANI, I WASHED MY
HANDS, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT

549
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,272
PASSED THROUGH TOUCH.

550
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,816
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THIS PERSON
NEXT TO ME.

551
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,586
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT RAJANI
WAS MERELY FRIGHTENED,

552
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,355
AS ANY WIFE OR EXPECTANT MOTHER
WOULD BE IN THOSE DAYS WHEN WE

553
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,359
UNDERSTOOD SO LITTLE ABOUT
AIDS.

554
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,963
I NEVER THOUGHT OF HOW DESERTED
SHE FELT AT HOME, WHILE I WAS

555
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:16,367
OFF PLAYING HERO.

556
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,037
I WANT YOU TO THINK OF THE
IMMUNE SYSTEM LIKE AN ORCHESTRA,

557
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,841
AND THE CD4 CELL LIKE THE
ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR.

558
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,645
NOW IF THE CONDUCTOR BREAKS DOWN
OR COLLAPSES, THERE IS TOTAL

559
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,846
CONFUSION.

560
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,515
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH
AIDS, AND THE BODY IS LEFT

561
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,485
VULNERABLE TO EVEN THE SIMPLEST
INFECTIONS.

562
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,623
BUT HOW IN THE WORLD DID
OUR GORDO GET IT?

563
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,526
YOU KNOW HOW HE GOT IT, MAMA,
DON'T YOU?

564
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,464
ALL I KNOW IS, THE GOOD LORD
DID NOT BRING HIM BACK JUST TO

565
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,667
TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN.

566
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:57,675
I DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS THIS AIDS
THING, OR NOTHIN' LIKE IT.

567
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,077
HE'S GONNA GET BETTER.

568
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,414
I JUST KNOW IT.

569
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,060
CHESTER MEWS AND LANGDON
ARWOOD.

570
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,662
THEY WANTED TO BE SEEN TOGETHER.

571
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,363
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

572
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,032
THEY WANNA BE EXAMINED.

573
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,834
I'VE ALREADY GIVEN THEM 
THE BLOOD TEST.

574
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,936
ALL RIGHT.

575
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:35,680
THIS MOMENT, THIS WAITING ON
THE THRESHOLD OF NEW PATIENTS,

576
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:44,021
WAS ONE THAT I WOULD COME TO
KNOW WELL.

577
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,724
I'M DR. ABRAHAM VERGHESE.

578
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,459
LANGDON ARWOOD.

579
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,162
I'M CHESTER MEWS.

580
00:38:51,195 --> 00:39:05,443
GOOD TO MEET YOU. 
HAVE A SEAT.

581
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,445
WE'RE FROM ABINGDON.

582
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,113
WE'RE HERE FOR THE AIDS TEST.

583
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,749
I'D HAVE HAD IT DONE THERE,
BUT LANGDON REFUSED.

584
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,752
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANNA BE 
THE TALK OF THE TOWN.

585
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:15,953
NOT THAT WE'RE NOT ALREADY.

586
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,656
DOES ABINGDON HAVE A MEETING
PLACE LIKE THE CONNECTION?

587
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,424
OH, LORD, NO.

588
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,161
I WISH.

589
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,631
LANGDON, HAVE YOU ALWAYS
BEEN GAY?

590
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:31,769
YES, THOUGH I TRIED TO BE
STRAIGHT.

591
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,673
I WAS HAVIN' SEX WITH CHESTER
WHEN I WAS SEVEN.

592
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,509
BUT I KEPT TELLIN' MYSELF
IT WAS WRONG.

593
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,045
SO HE GOT MARRIED AND HAD
THREE KIDS.

594
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,748
YOU LEFT TOWN. WHAT WAS 
I TO DO?

595
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,149
YOU GOT MARRIED FIRST.

596
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,083
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO LEAVE.

597
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,453
SO YOU WERE CHILDHOOD
SWEETHEARTS, HUH?

598
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,623
SAY THAT, YES.

599
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,825
ARE YOU STILL MARRIED?

600
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,794
OH, LORDY, NO.

601
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,163
NO, I FINALLY HAD TO ADMIT IT.

602
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:03,033
I'M ABOUT AS STRAIGHT AS 
A THREE-DOLLAR BILL.

603
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,738
CHESTER CAME BACK FROM NEW YORK
'CAUSE I WAS SO ALLURIN',

604
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,241
AND, UH, I GOT DIVORCED.

605
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:15,679
WE SET UP HOUSEKEEPIN' GOIN' ON
TWELVE YEARS NOW.

606
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,915
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE
ANAL-RECEPTIVE INTERCOURSE?

607
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,049
NOT OFTEN ENOUGH.

608
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,752
CHESTER!

609
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,555
HAVE YOU HAD OTHER PARTNERS
IN THE RECENT PAST?

610
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,823
YEAH.  CHES.

611
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,860
ON WEEKENDS, WE LIKE TO HAVE
WHAT WE CALL RECREATIONAL SEX.

612
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,564
WE LIKE TO DRIVE UP 
THE INTERSTATE TO TRUCK STOPS.

613
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,566
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE.

614
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,902
WE CALL 'EM, WHAT IS IT?

615
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,236
PICKLE PACKERS.

616
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,738
OR PECKER PICKLERS.

617
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,239
ARE THEY GAY?

618
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,574
LORD, NO. NO.

619
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,109
THEY JUST WANT RELIEF.

620
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,845
AREN'T THERE WOMEN TURNING
TRICKS AT THESE PLACES?

621
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,079
YEAH.  YOU BET.

622
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,182
WHY WOULDN'T A TRUCKER GO
WITH A WOMAN IF THAT'S WHAT HE

623
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,683
WANTS?

624
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,252
FOR ONE THING, HE'D HAVE TO
PAY FOR IT.

625
00:40:55,286 --> 00:41:00,191
LORD KNOWS, HE WOULDN'T LIKE
IT HALF AS MUCH.

626
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:04,295
CHESTER, I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE
YOU NOW, IF I MAY.

627
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,630
YEAH.

628
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:25,883
WOULD YOU LEAN BACK FOR ME,
PLEASE?

629
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:30,054
OKAY, LOOK UP. RIGHT UP.

630
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:52,843
CAN YOU TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF,
PLEASE?

631
00:41:52,843 --> 00:42:05,856
CAN YOU TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF,
PLEASE?

632
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,325
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DOC.

633
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,793
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ME.

634
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,863
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

635
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,232
HE'S BEEN REAL TIRED.

636
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,668
SOMETIMES AT NIGHTS, HE...

637
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:23,874
HE BREAKS INTO A COLD SWEAT,
AND HE CRIES IN HIS SLEEP.

638
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,678
WILL YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM, DOC?

639
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,682
I LOVED HIM SINCE WE WERE SEVEN
YEARS OLD.

640
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,352
HE IS MY LIFE.

641
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,823
I WOULDN'T WANNA LIVE...

642
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:44,795
( sobbing )
 OKAY, HONEY, COME ON.

643
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,835
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

644
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,370
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

645
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,906
I PROMISE YOU I'LL DO 
MY BEST.

646
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,109
WHEN THE RESULTS COME IN, WE'LL
PLOT OUT A STRATEGY, OKAY?

647
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,378
OKAY.

648
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,215
IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE TRY
NOT TO WORRY.

649
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,686
YOU ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

650
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:33,410
LORD, I'D DIE FOR A MAN TO LOVE
ME LIKE THAT.

651
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,914
OH, I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

652
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,183
I GOT CAUGHT UP AT THE CLINIC.

653
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:53,097
I'LL JUST RUN UPSTAIRS AND TAKE
A SHOWER. WON'T BE A MINUTE.

654
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,299
SAME GYM, SAME PEOPLE.

655
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,368
OH, DIFFERENT HOST.

656
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,871
NO BLOODY BOOZE.

657
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,873
HELLO, SIR.  VIKRAM, HI.

658
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,241
MEET MY WIFE.

659
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:07,277
RAJANI, THIS IS VIKRAM, ONE 
OF MY INTERNS.

660
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,081
NAMASTE.

661
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,017
IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME HERE?

662
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,152
YES, SIR.

663
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,422
YOU'LL NEED SOME OF THIS.

664
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,328
RAJNITI! HOW ARE YOU?

665
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,196
SO YOU'VE GIVEN UP DANCING.

666
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,431
AHA, THAT'S JUST FOR NOW.

667
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,434
WE WERE HOPING YOU WOULD KICK
OFF THE CULTURAL PROGRAM AT

668
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,103
THE INDIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY
CELEBRATION.

669
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,439
SARYUJI, I HAVE STOPPED
PERFORMING.

670
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,042
I FEEL TOO OUT OF TOUCH IN
THIS COUNTRY.

671
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,476
NO MUSICIANS, NO COLLEAGUES.

672
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,211
NOW I ONLY DANCE FOR MYSELF.

673
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,447
VERY SELFISH OF YOU,
DEPRIVING US.

674
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,848
SMILING, LADIES.

675
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,383
SMILING, SMILING, SMILING.

676
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,319
VERY GOOD.

677
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,089
SO, HOW IS AIDS, VERGHESE?

678
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,824
OH, PICKING UP.

679
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,027
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE STILL
RENTING THE HOUSE FROM V.A.

680
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,529
SUCH FOOLISHNESS.

681
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,730
YOU MUST BUY.

682
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,900
I LIKE OUR HOUSE, AND WE HAVE
THE MOST WONDERFUL GARDEN.

683
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,269
YES, YES, YES, THAT IS RIGHT,
BUT WHAT ABOUT EQUITY?

684
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,504
ABRAHAM, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

685
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,474
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR
SPECIALTY...

686
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,476
IN SWEDEN, THORACIC SURGEONS
AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES

687
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:13,977
SPECIALISTS GET THE SAME SALARY.

688
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,114
THAT IS WHY WE DON'T LIVE
IN SWEDEN.

689
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,017
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,
GENTLEMEN, THIS WAY, PLEASE,

690
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,185
PLEASE, PLEASE. BE HAPPY.

691
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:25,389
SO THE UROLOGIST REMOVED
REAGAN'S PROSTATE, RIGHT?

692
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:29,860
REAGAN SAID TO HIM,
( imitating Reagan ) "IS

693
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,997
EVERYTHING OKAY, DOC? WILL 
THE PLUMBING WORK WELL NOW?"

694
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,467
( interns laugh )
 UROLOGIST SAID,

695
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,103
( Indian accent ) "SIR,
EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

696
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,238
YOUR BLADDER'S FINE.

697
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,941
YOUR PENIS IS 100%.

698
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,543
YOU CAN GO OUT AND FUCK 
THE COUNTRY FOR ANOTHER

699
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,280
FOUR YEARS!"
 BUT, LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE SEEIN'

700
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:54,952
YOUR PATIENTS, DON'T THEY, LIKE,
SEE YOU AS A FOREIGNER?

701
00:45:54,985 --> 00:46:01,458
I MEAN, LIKE, ISN'T IT HARD
OVERCOMIN' THAT?

702
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,328
ACTUALLY, NO.

703
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,464
IT WORKS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

704
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,835
THEY TELL ME THINGS THAT THEY
WOULDN'T TELL A WHITE DOCTOR.

705
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:16,039
THEY FEEL... THEY FEEL I WON'T
JUDGE THEM.

706
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:22,346
MAYBE THEY FEEL I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO JUDGE THEM.

707
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:27,084
MY TEST CAME BACK POSITIVE,
DIDN'T IT?

708
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,555
YES.

709
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,463
YOU'RE WHAT'S CALLED AN
ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER, VICKIE.

710
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:44,368
YOU HAVE THE VIRUS, BUT YOUR CD4
COUNT IS HIGH.

711
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,403
ALMOST NORMAL, IN FACT.

712
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,272
HOW LONG WILL I LIVE?

713
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,508
IF YOU QUIT SMOKING, YOU
SHOULD BE AROUND FOR SOME TIME.

714
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,644
WHAT, A YEAR?

715
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,013
TWO YEARS?

716
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,247
TEN YEARS?

717
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,184
THIS IS STILL A RELATIVELY
NEW DISEASE.

718
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,451
DON'T BULLSHIT ME.

719
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,154
IF YOU DON'T KNOW, JUST SAY SO.

720
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,191
THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH
BEING DONE.

721
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,126
I'M SURE THEY'LL FIND A CURE.

722
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,627
WHEN?

723
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,497
WHEN?

724
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:18,435
I DON'T KNOW.

725
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:26,543
WHAT ABOUT MY SISTER?

726
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:31,081
SHE'S POSITIVE, AS WELL.

727
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,220
OH, MY GOD, I KNEW IT.

728
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:40,958
I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT.

729
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,492
I'M SORRY.

730
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,263
OH, ME, TOO.

731
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,466
ME, TOO.

732
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,691
MOM?

733
00:48:52,462 --> 00:49:01,638
SO WHAT IS OUR CD4 COUNT,
DOC?

734
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:05,142
LANGDON'S 500.

735
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:09,680
YOURS, I'M AFRAID, IS ONLY 30.

736
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:27,097
HEY, WHAT THE HELL, HUH?

737
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,033
( telephone rings )
 SAY, DOC, WILL YOU HAVE

738
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,440
A COFFEE WITH ME?

739
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,774
NOW?

740
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,577
FORGET IT. SORRY I ASKED.

741
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,713
NO, NO. OF COURSE I WILL.

742
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,148
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

743
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:55,092
( both laughing )
 SEE, DOC, I GOT NO REGRETS,

744
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,426
YOU KNOW.

745
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,764
I MEAN, I HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME
BUT MYSELF.

746
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:04,101
I'VE HAD MORE SEX THAN TEN
HETEROSEXUALS WOULD'VE HAD

747
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,569
IN A LIFETIME.

748
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:09,539
I WAS IN NEW YORK IN THE HEYDAY
OF BEIN' GAY--BATH HOUSES,

749
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,409
FIRE ISLAND, AND ALL THAT.

750
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,578
OH, HO, HO, HO.

751
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:20,350
I MEAN, WE FUCKED LIKE CRAZY.

752
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,586
AND NOW, HERE WE ARE.

753
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:26,123
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S
A PUNISHMENT FROM GOD OR ANY

754
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,591
OF THAT CRAP.

755
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:32,596
I DO AGREE IT'S THE CONSEQUENCE
OF A CERTAIN LIFESTYLE.

756
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:37,534
BUT IF I WAS TO BE REBORN,
I'D WANNA COME BACK GAY.

757
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,304
I MEAN, NO INSULT TO YOU, DOC,
BUT MOST STRAIGHT MEN ARE

758
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,207
BEER-GUZZLIN' SLOTHS, AT LEAST
FROM AROUND HERE.

759
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,510
WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP?

760
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,479
OH, THE USUAL. I HAD TO HIDE,
PRETEND I WAS STRAIGHT.

761
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,716
PRETEND TO LAUGH WHEN SOMEBODY
TOLD A FAGGOT JOKE.

762
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,585
WHEN I GOT TO NEW YORK,
WE STARTED A GROUP CALLED

763
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,421
THE GAY LIBERATION FRONT.

764
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,490
ALL OF US WERE YOUNG, FULL OF
REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT.

765
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:04,494
I MEAN, WE WERE OUT THERE IN
YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME.

766
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,630
SO WHAT BROUGHT YOU BACK
TO TENNESSEE?

767
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,399
I MISSED LANGDON SOMETHING
AWFUL.

768
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,235
WHICH IS WHAT I WANNA TALK TO
YOU ABOUT.

769
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,638
YOU SEE, HE'S NEVER REALLY BEEN
GOOD ABOUT TAKING CARE

770
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,675
OF HIMSELF.

771
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,178
WHEN I GO...

772
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:29,486
WOULD YOU KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR HIM?

773
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,754
ABRAHAM?

774
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,223
HMM.

775
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,859
ARE YOU SEXUALLY ATTRACTED
TO GAY MEN?

776
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,561
WHAT?

777
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,263
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

778
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,933
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING
ME THIS.

779
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,634
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

780
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:50,173
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU SEEM VERY
COMFORTABLE AROUND THEM.

781
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,408
YOU'RE RIGHT.

782
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,511
IN A STRANGE WAY, I'VE COME TO
LEARN MORE ABOUT BEING A MAN

783
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:57,280
FROM GAY MEN THAN FROM STRAIGHT
MEN.

784
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,949
REALLY?

785
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:02,219
MEANING I'VE LEARNED THERE
ARE OTHER SIDES TO BEING A MAN.

786
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:06,423
THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE THE
ARTS, TO REALLY LISTEN TO WOMEN

787
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,860
AND BEFRIEND THEM.

788
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:14,531
YOU'RE NOT TURNING SWEET ON
ME, ARE YOU?

789
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,300
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

790
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,703
LISTEN, WITH GAY MEN, YOU'RE
LOOKING AT MEN WITHOUT THE

791
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,304
INFLUENCE OF WOMEN.

792
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,974
MEN WHO ARE NOT CONDITIONED BY
WHAT WOMEN WILL ALLOW,

793
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,909
WHAT WOMEN WILL ACCEPT.

794
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,478
MEANING WHAT?

795
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:32,616
MEANING THE SEXUAL LIFE OF 
A GAY MAN IS PERHAPS WHAT

796
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,653
ALL MEN WOULD LIKE, IF LEFT 
TO THEMSELVES.

797
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:41,958
VARIETY OF PARTNERS, ANONYMOUS
SEX.

798
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:46,663
EXCEPT THEY CAN'T GET WOMEN
TO AGREE, SO...

799
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:53,937
IS THAT WHAT YOU'D REALLY
LIKE?

800
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:58,475
BY THE WAY, THE ANSWER TO
YOUR QUESTION IS NO.

801
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,577
I'M ATTRACTED TO YOU.

802
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:06,683
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY
ABOUT WHAT THE NEIGHBORS THINK.

803
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:10,554
HAVE YOU HAD ANY NEGATIVE
REACTIONS FROM ANYONE?

804
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:14,524
IF THEY GOT ANYTHING NEGATIVE
TO SAY, THEY SURE BETTER NOT

805
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,928
SAY IT TO ME.

806
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,531
SOME WOMEN FROM OUR CHURCH HAVE
COME BY AND BROUGHT FOOD.

807
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,733
NOT THAT GORDY WANTS TO EAT
ANYTHING.

808
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:28,371
ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT IS TO GET
BAPTIZED.

809
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,341
Gordon:
LAST NIGHT, I SAW
JESUS.

810
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,777
♪ ... BE UNBROKEN
BY AND BY, LORD, BY AND BY ♪

811
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,847
I WOKE UP, AND THERE WAS
THIS CLOUD AROUND MY BED.

812
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,617
I WASN'T DREAMIN', MIND YOU.

813
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,687
MY EYES WERE WIDE OPEN, AND
I COULD SEE MAMA LAYIN' THERE.

814
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,923
♪ WILL THE CIRCLE
BE UNBROKEN... ♪

815
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,392
AND A VOICE SPOKE OUT OF
THE CLOUD.

816
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,928
"EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT,
GORDON."

817
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,897
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT...

818
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,533
AND A HAND REACHED OUT
TO ME...

819
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,335
HALLELUJAH!

820
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:04,841
AND I JUST KNEW IT WAS HIM.

821
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:27,564
I'M READY TO DIE, MATTIE.

822
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:37,641
I KNOW HE'S WAITIN' FOR ME ON
THE OTHER SIDE.

823
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:59,529
I KNOW HE'S WAITIN' FOR ME ON
THE OTHER SIDE.

824
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,999
THAT'S MY COUSIN GRACE TOOTH 
WHAT DONE THAT.

825
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:07,137
Y'ALL ARE GONNA THINK I'M AWFUL,
BUT WHAT THE HELL?

826
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,672
SEE, THERE'S MY COUSIN GRACE.

827
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,774
SHE WORKS HERE AT THE HOSPITAL.

828
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,543
SHE DONE TOLD EVERYONE IN
CHESTER HOLLER THAT CLYDE AND

829
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,878
I HAVE AIDS.

830
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,714
PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE SO DAMN
INQUISITIVE.

831
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,983
THEY WOULDN'T HESITATE TO STOP
A FUNERAL TO ASK WHAT DECEASED

832
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,184
THE CORPSE.

833
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,887
ANYWAY, GRACE AND HER HUSBAND
ANDREW, THEY BEEN GOIN' TO

834
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,055
THIS HOLINESS CHURCH.

835
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,256
I NEVER GO NO MORE.

836
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,858
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THAT BABBLIN'
IN TONGUES AND HOLY SPIRIT

837
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:29,959
STUFF.

838
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,595
OH, THAT SCARES THE SHIT OUT
OF ME.

839
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,632
BUT CLYDE, NOW THAT HE'S SICK,
HE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO GO.

840
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,468
SO GRACE STANDS UP IN CHURCH,
SHE TELLS THE WHOLE GODDAMN

841
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:42,772
CHURCH THAT CLYDE HAS AIDS,
AND WOULD THE CHURCH BE WILLIN'

842
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,842
FOR HIM TO COME THERE 'CAUSE HE
VERY MUCH WANTS TO.

843
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,645
DID YOU OR CLYDE ASK HER 
TO DO THAT?

844
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,914
HELL, NO! SHE JUST TOOK IT ON
HERSELF TO DO IT.

845
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,817
AND BY THE WAY, THE CONGREGATION
SAID NO.

846
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,686
THEN THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE
TO TELL ME THIS.

847
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,789
I JUST SAID TO HER, "YOU LITTLE
DUMB ASS. WHO TOLD YOU TO GO

848
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:00,957
TALKIN' LIKE THAT?

849
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,526
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THE
SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT?

850
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,029
DON'T YOU EVER SET FOOT IN
MY HOUSE AGAIN OR I'LL JACK SLAP

851
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,931
YOUR ASS TILL KINGDOM COME."

852
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:11,067
"WELL," ANDREW SAYS, "WE'LL COME
VISIT OUR COUSIN CLYDE ANY TIME

853
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,202
WE PLEASE."

854
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,904
THAT'S WHEN I PICKED UP
THE POKER AND WENT AFTER HIM.

855
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,807
BUDDY, HE LIT ON OUTTA THERE
LIKE HIS PANTS WERE ON FIRE.

856
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,042
GRACE WAS JUST STANDIN' THERE.

857
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:22,545
I GOT SO MAD JUST LOOKIN' AT HER
FACE, I WENT AFTER HER WITH

858
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,780
MY FISTS.

859
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,082
I DROPPED HER WITH ONE SHOT,
THEN I SAT ON HER AND JUST GIVE

860
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:26,750
IT TO HER.

861
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,685
BUST A FEW TEETH, I RECKON.

862
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:33,656
WHOMPED HER REAL GOOD.

863
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,897
REMIND ME NOT TO MESS 
WITH YOU.

864
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,800
OH, DOC, I'D NEVER DO THAT TO
SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T DESERVE IT.

865
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:48,471
VICKIE, WOULD YOU MIND
REMOVING YOUR BANDANNA, PLEASE?

866
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:52,876
I NEED TO DO A FULL EXAMINATION.

867
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:06,923
OH, I'M REAL ASHAMED
ABOUT THIS.

868
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:12,262
OH, I'M REAL ASHAMED
ABOUT THIS.

869
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:15,031
I DID IT.

870
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,000
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

871
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:24,607
I JUST SAT IN THE TRAILER AND
YANKED IT OUT A HAIR AT A TIME.

872
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,976
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED
OF.

873
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,012
YOU'RE UNDER INCREDIBLE STRESS.

874
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,880
IT HAPPENS.

875
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,282
THERE'S EVEN A NAME FOR IT.

876
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:34,617
IT'S CALLED...  CRAZY.

877
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:42,258
NO, IT'S CALLED
TRICHOTILLOMANIA.

878
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,994
IT'S NOT FAIR.

879
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,163
IT'S NOT FAIR.

880
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:51,134
I KNOW IT ISN'T.

881
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,203
DOOCHIE.

882
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:31,608
HEY, MATTIE.

883
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,110
DOOCHIE, I WANT YOU TO OPEN
UP THAT CASKET.

884
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,312
HMM?

885
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:41,251
WELL, MATTIE, YOU SAID YOUR
BROTHER WANTED A CLOSED CASKET.

886
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,753
HE WANTED IT CLOSED FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT I WANNA

887
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:44,954
SEE HE LOOKS ALL RIGHT.

888
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:49,225
YOU GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP.

889
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:18,021
GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE BOTTOM
HALF OF THIS CASKET.

890
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,190
OH, WHITE SUIT, THE WHITE SUIT.

891
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,860
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.

892
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,696
HIS FAVORITE.

893
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:30,733
DOOCHIE, WHY DON'T GORDON HAVE
ANY SOCKS ON?

894
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:36,005
MATTIE, WE DON'T USUALLY
PUT NO SOCKS ON.

895
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,841
I DON'T WANT GORDON GOIN' TO
HEAVEN WITHOUT ANY SOCKS.

896
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:48,284
YOU GO GET HIM SOME SOCKS 
RIGHT NOW.

897
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,253
DOOCHIE!  EH?

898
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:53,356
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU 
THINK YOU'RE GONNA CATCH

899
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,824
FROM HIM NOW?

900
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,025
YOU DONE PICKLED HIS BODY.

901
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,161
THERE'S NOT A BUG IN THE WORLD
THAT'S GONNA SURVIVE THAT.

902
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,429
WELL, MATTIE...

903
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:03,900
OKAY, JUST PUT HIS SOCKS ON.

904
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,772
OOH! DOOCHIE!

905
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,443
TAKE OFF THEM CAMPIN' GLOVES AND
YOU PUT HIS SOCKS ON RIGHT.

906
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,346
YOU THINK THIS IS THE LAST TIME
YOU'RE GONNA BE CALLED UPON

907
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,147
TO DO THIS?

908
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,383
NOW I WANNA SEE YOU DO IT.

909
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,318
OKAY.  GET...!

910
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:27,457
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

911
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,394
LET ME HELP YOU.

912
01:00:49,946 --> 01:01:01,858
THIS IS WHERE HE WANTED
TO BE BURIED.

913
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:12,301
THIS IS WHERE I'D WANT TO BE
BURIED, TOO.

914
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,271
THAT'S MY PLOT.

915
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:32,522
( phone ringing )
 DR. VERGHESE.

916
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:34,390
DOC, CHESTER'S VERY SICK.

917
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,393
HE'S VERY, VERY SHORT OF
BREATH, AND HE'S RUNNIN'

918
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,095
A FEVER OF 104.

919
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,531
DR. VERGHESE, HE'S TURNIN'
BLUE ON ME.

920
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,866
LANGDON, LANGDON, CALM DOWN.

921
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,469
CALL AN AMBULANCE, TELL THEM TO
BRING YOU TO THE MEDICAL CENTER.

922
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:49,205
COME STRAIGHT TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM, AND I'LL MEET YOU RIGHT

923
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:53,276
THERE, OKAY?

924
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,314
DOCTOR, NO MACHINES, PLEASE.

925
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,149
NO MACHINES.

926
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,150
WHY?

927
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,419
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD
ME, NO MACHINES.

928
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,454
WHEN DID HE TELL YOU?

929
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,555
JUST NOW?

930
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,090
NO, NO, A LONG TIME AGO.

931
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,357
DID HE PUT IT INTO WRITING?

932
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,492
NO.

933
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:12,562
( Chester gasping )
 GET A GOWN, GOGGLES AND MASK

934
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,197
READY FOR ME.

935
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,099
SHOULDN'T WE CALL AN
ANESTHETIST?

936
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:20,269
WE HAVE NO TIME TO FIND ONE
WHO'LL WORK ON AN AIDS PATIENT.

937
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,038
THIS IS DR. VERGHESE.

938
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,040
THESE ARE CHESTER'S BROTHERS.

939
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,542
CAN I TELL THEM WHAT'S
GOING ON?

940
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,544
TELL 'EM EVERYTHING.

941
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,379
CHESTER IS VERY SICK.

942
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,248
HE HAS AIDS.

943
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,017
RIGHT NOW, HE HAS A BAD
PNEUMONIA, SO I HAVE TO PUT HIM

944
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,920
ON A BREATHING MACHINE IN THE
NEXT FEW MINUTES OR HE WILL DIE.

945
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,923
BUT LANGDON TELLS ME CHESTER
HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE NOT TO BE

946
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:41,924
PUT ON THE MACHINE.

947
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:45,061
HE SAYS HE NEVER WANTED TO BE
ON NO MACHINES.

948
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,329
WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS.

949
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,898
WE HAVE NO TIME. I NEED TO GO
RIGHT BACK IN.

950
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,300
THEN PUT HIM ON THE BREATHING
MACHINE IF YOU HAVE TO.

951
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,236
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

952
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:57,073
( Langdon weeping )
 WE ARE HIS FAMILY.

953
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:05,214
WE ARE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIM.

954
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:09,519
LANGDON, I HAVE TO GO IN.

955
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,495
( whispers ) CHES.

956
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:23,199
I HAD, WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO
THE FINAL MOMENT, GIVEN

957
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:26,903
CHESTER'S BROTHERS THE POWER OF
FAMILY, NOT LANGDON.

958
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:31,107
I, TOO, HAD BETRAYED BOTH OF
THEM, BUT THERE WAS NO TIME

959
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,909
TO LOOK BACK NOW.

960
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:37,480
BRING HIM DOWN.

961
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:50,960
( gurgling sounds )
 COME ON, ABE, YOU CAN DO IT.

962
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:01,237
YOU CAN DO IT.

963
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:08,911
BAG HIM.

964
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,038
HELLO.

965
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:40,276
ALLEN, I NEED SOME HELP.

966
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,312
SADIE, DID YOU KNOW
INTUBATION WAS INVENTED BY

967
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,982
A PHYSICIAN NAMED O'DWYER
AS A LIFESAVING MEASURE IN

968
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,350
DIPHTHERIA?

969
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,484
MM-MM.

970
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,520
IT IS, THEREFORE, AN
INFECTIOUS DISEASES PROCEDURE.

971
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,222
YEAH, RIGHT.

972
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:56,125
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

973
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,629
( pager beeping )
 ( phone ringing )

974
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:20,049
DR. VERGHESE, YOUR FRIEND
ALLEN CALLED.

975
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,350
YOUR WIFE'S BEEN ADMITTED.

976
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:26,222
YOU'RE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY.

977
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,625
I WAS TOTALLY AT THE MERCY
OF GOD OR NATURE.

978
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,329
GIVEN ALL THAT I HAD SEEN
RECENTLY, ALL THE SUFFERING,

979
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:37,033
ALL THE SADNESS, AN EASY,
UNCOMPLICATED BIRTH SEEMED

980
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:41,103
ALMOST TOO MUCH TO HOPE FOR.

981
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,542
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO BUY YOU
A CIGAR.

982
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:50,346
CONGRATULATIONS, DOC, IT'S
ANOTHER FINE SON!

983
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,315
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, DOC.

984
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:56,152
WITH A BOY, ALL YOU HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IS ONE DICK IN TOWN.

985
01:05:56,185 --> 01:06:06,228
WITH A GIRL, YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ALL THE DICKS IN TOWN.

986
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:16,772
WITH A GIRL, YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ALL THE DICKS IN TOWN.

987
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:22,244
WHERE WERE YOU?

988
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,814
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

989
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:30,686
I WAS AT AN EMERGENCY, AND
I RUSHED RIGHT OVER.

990
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:38,060
SWEETHEART, I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

991
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,663
LET'S MAKE THIS A NEW BEGINNING.

992
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:45,634
I PROMISE YOU, THINGS ARE GONNA
CHANGE. THEY'LL CHANGE.

993
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,472
I'LL WORK HARD TO MAKE THINGS
BETTER FOR US.

994
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:54,844

995
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:59,582
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE JACOB?

996
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:03,152
WHERE IS HE?

997
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,422
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

998
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,876

DR. VERGHESE,

BLUE.

1000
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:36,752
GO, BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
STEPHEN WITH YOU.

1001
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,220
COME ON, STEPHEN.

1002
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,723
COME ON, BABY.

1003
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:55,571
CLAIRE. CLAIRE!

1004
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,444
HE'S HAD ANOTHER AMP 
OF BICARB.

1005
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,747
STOP CPR.

1006
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,417
HE'S ASYSTOLIC.

1007
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:09,919
THERE'S NO OUTPUT.

1008
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:12,521
WE'VE BEEN GOIN' AT THIS 
LONG ENOUGH.

1009
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:15,891
LET'S CALL IT.

1010
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,836
THANKS, EVERYBODY.

1011
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,933
I DIDN'T THINK HIS HEART WOULD
QUIT SO QUICKLY.

1012
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:02,838
I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE HIM
ANOTHER FEW MONTHS.

1013
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:05,541
WELL, THEY'RE ALL GONNA DIE,
AREN'T THEY?

1014
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:09,812
THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT TO THIS.

THANK YOU.

1031
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:18,407
ABRAHAM, IT'S SARAH PRESNELL,
FROM KENTUCKY.

1032
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,111
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AT HOME,
BUT I HAVE A SAD, SAD SITUATION

1033
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,013
HERE.

1034
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:27,916
A WONDERFUL MAN I KNOW,
LLOYD FLANDERS,

1035
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,052
IS INFECTED WITH HIV.

1036
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,722
NOBODY BUT ME, NOW YOU,
KNOWS THAT HE'S INFECTED.

1037
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,492
NOT EVEN HIS SON AND DAUGHTER
KNOW.

1038
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,960
I CAN'T TREAT HIM.

1039
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:40,896
I'M WILLING TO TREAT HIM, BUT
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS HIM.

1040
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,631
HE'S A PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY.

1041
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,632
HOW DID HE GET IT?

1042
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,034
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

1043
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,903
THEY DID OPEN-HEART SURGERY
AND GAVE HIM A TRANSFUSION,

1044
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,806
JUST WEEKS BEFORE THEY STARTED
SCREENING BLOOD.

1045
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,374
SO YOU WANNA SEND HIM OVER?

1046
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,077
TONIGHT, IF IT'S OKAY
WITH YOU.

1047
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:59,915
OKAY. RIGHT. VERY GOOD.

1048
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,788
MR. FLANDERS?

1049
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,158
OH. DR. VERGHESE.

1050
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:14,029
OH, I'M JUST DELIGHTED TO
SEE YOU.

1051
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,499
HOPE, THIS IS DR. VERGHESE.

1052
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:21,737
SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

1053
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,606
ADMIT THEM. I'LL FILL OUT
THE FORMS LATER.

1054
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,641
YES, DOCTOR.

1055
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,909
THANK YOU.

1056
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,510
ALLOW ME.

1057
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:32,915
THANK YOU.

1058
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:42,057
OH, IT'S EASIER FOR THE QUEEN
TO SLIP OUT OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE

1059
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:46,061
THAN IT IS FOR US TO BE GONE
FROM HOME.

1060
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:49,198
SARAH TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR
SITUATION, DIDN'T SHE?

1061
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:52,034
YES, SHE DID, MR. FLANDERS.

1062
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,937
CALL ME LLOYD, SON.

1063
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,506
ALL RIGHT, LLOYD.

1064
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,677
NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW WE
HAVE AIDS.

1065
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,679
WE?

1066
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,815
WHAT?

1067
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:10,552
I GAVE HOPE THE VIRUS.

1068
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:16,458
WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

1069
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:27,169
BABY KEPT ME AWAKE TILL NOW.

1070
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:29,171
I THINK IT COULD BE COLIC.

1071
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,807
AS WE WALKED DOWN THAT
CORRIDOR, I FELT AS IF THEY

1072
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,176
WERE MY PARENTS.

1073
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:37,179
OR A FAVORITE UNCLE AND AUNT
WHO WERE SICK AND NEEDED

1074
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:40,516
MY HELP.

1075
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,152
AND I FELT GUILTY.

1076
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:46,989
I MEAN, I NEVER ESCORT MY
PATIENTS UP TO THEIR ROOM.

1077
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,192
I NEVER CARRY THEIR LUGGAGE.

1078
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:56,632
WHY WAS I DOING ALL THIS?

1079
01:13:56,665 --> 01:14:03,605
MAYBE BECAUSE I, TOO, THOUGHT
THEY WERE INNOCENT VICTIMS.

1080
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,842
MAYBE I ALSO HAVE A BLIND SPOT.

1081
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:17,953
EAT. ABRAHAM.

1082
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:20,522
I WONDER WHAT LIES THEY HAD
TO INVENT TO TELL THEIR

1083
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:25,561
CHILDREN.

1084
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:30,532
I WISH THIS DISEASE WAS GONE.

1085
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:34,603
THAT YOU WERE NOT SO CLOSE
TO IT.

1086
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:40,008
IT'S KIND OF BECOME WHO YOU ARE.

1087
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:47,182
STEPHEN, JACOB AND I ARE LOSING
YOU TO IT.

1088
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:50,018
I WISH IT WAS GONE, TOO.

1089
01:14:50,052 --> 01:15:00,095
( baby crying )
 BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO, IS IT?

1090
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:20,983
( baby crying )
 BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO, IS IT?

1091
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,618
OH!

1092
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:23,919
MR. FLANDERS.

1093
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,221
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

1094
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,823
THE SAME.

1095
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,892
ALWAYS THE SAME.

1096
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,127
PLEASE.

1097
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,996
HOW ABOUT YOU?

1098
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,865
OH, FINE.

1099
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,869
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HELP
WORRYING.

1100
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,671
WHY?

1101
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:47,109
IT'S SUCH A LONELY BUSINESS
TO CARRY THIS BURDEN.

1102
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:50,112
I'M SURE YOUR CHILDREN WILL
UNDERSTAND.

1103
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,380
YOUR CHURCH MEMBERS.

1104
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:57,152
IF ANYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY
KNOWS, NEXT TIME HOPE AND I GO

1105
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,689
TO CHURCH, IT'LL BE AN EMPTY
CHURCH.

1106
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,391
I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

1107
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,360
I HAD A PATIENT HERE WHO HAD THE
SUPPORT OF JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY

1108
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,828
IN HIS CHURCH.

1109
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,831
I WORRY ABOUT HOPE.

1110
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:15,203
WHO'S GONNA LOOK AFTER HER
THE WAY SHE'S LOOKED AFTER ME?

1111
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:20,008
AFTER I DIE, I DON'T WANT HER TO
SUFFER THE STIGMA OF AIDS.

1112
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,679
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW OUR CHILDREN
WILL REACT TO THIS.

1113
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:26,014
HOW WILL OUR SON-IN-LAW FEEL
ABOUT US BEING WITH HIS

1114
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,016
CHILDREN?

1115
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,086
IT SEEMS SUCH A SHAME TO BE
WASTING SO MUCH ENERGY ON

1116
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,922
KEEPING UP THIS SECRET.

1117
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:36,892
THE TWO OF YOU ARE SO ALONE--
 ABRAHAM, I DON'T THINK YOU

1118
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,293
UNDERSTAND.

1119
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,162
WE ARE NOT ALONE.

1120
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:44,299
THE ONE UNSHAKEABLE PRESENCE
IN OUR LIFE IS CHRIST.

1121
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:48,971
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS
VIRUS IS FROM HELL.

1122
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:52,074
IT IS NOT FROM GOD.

1123
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:56,445
AND I MEAN TO FIGHT IT WITH ALL
I HAVE.

1124
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:02,684
OH, IT'LL GET ME IN THE END, BUT
NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT.

1125
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:07,389
I WILL NEVER GIVE IN. NEVER.

1126
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,930
WHAT?

1127
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,732
NOTHING.

1128
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:17,866
LIKE HELL, NOTHIN'.

1129
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,936
( trailer rattles )
 THAT'S JUST CLYDE TURNIN'

1130
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,237
IN BED.

1131
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,906
YOU COULD FEEL A TICK BURP
IN HERE.

1132
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,411
IT DON'T TAKE MUCH TO SHAKE 
THAT TRAILER.

1133
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:33,949
HOW ARE THINGS BETWEEN YOU
AND HIM, VICKIE?

1134
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,485
ARE YOU STILL ANGRY WITH CLYDE?

1135
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:43,892
WELL, I CAN'T GET ANGRY
NO MORE.

1136
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,194
SEE, I LOVE THE MAN.

1137
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,963
CAN'T HELP IT.

1138
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,799
I ALWAYS HAVE.

1139
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,902
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I LOST IT
WITH HIM, THOUGH.

1140
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:56,505
I WAS AT THE STOVE, FIXIN'
OATMEAL, WHEN HE PIPES UP,

1141
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,808
"HELL, I THINK I MIGHT JUST GO
AROUND AND GIVE THIS TO AS MANY

1142
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,377
PEOPLE AS I CAN, SEEIN' AS HOW
SOMEONE DONE GAVE IT TO ME."

1143
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:05,280
I WAS SO SHOCKED, I ALMOST HIT
THE FLOOR.

1144
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,083
I HAD THE OATMEAL IN MY HAND,
IT WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN MUCH FOR

1145
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:09,317
ME TO FLING IT AT HIM.

1146
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,887
BUT I SAID, "CLYDE, YOU DONE
ALREADY PUT THE DEATH SENTENCE

1147
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,121
ON TWO PEOPLE.

1148
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,791
DON'T YOU DARE THINK ABOUT IT,
OR I'LL KILL YOU MYSELF, YOU

1149
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:19,995
SON OF A BITCH."

1150
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,398
I ASKED MYSELF, WHAT WOULD 
IT BE LIKE TO BE IN VICKIE'S

1151
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,100
SHOES?

1152
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,536
COULD I HAVE REACTED LIKE
SHE DID?

1153
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:31,239
WOULD I HAVE HAD HER COURAGE?

1154
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,308
Clyde: CHANGE CHANNELS.

1155
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:34,509
CHANGE CHANNELS!

1156
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,977
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

1157
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:43,885
I BET HE'S MESSED HIS PANTS,
TOO.

1158
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,520
CHANGE CHANNELS!

1159
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,255
OKAY, CLYDE.

1160
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,423
CHANGE CHANNELS!

1161
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:49,791
OKAY, CLYDE, I'M COMIN'.

1162
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,493
I'M CHANGIN', I'M CHANGIN'.

1163
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,895
CALM DOWN.

1164
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,299
THERE.

1165
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,201
THERE'S BUGS BUNNY.

1166
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:03,472
THERE HE IS.

1167
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:08,176
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

1168
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,112
CLYDE?

1169
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:12,447
ZOO.

1170
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,283
HE STARES AT THE TUBE DAY
AND NIGHT.

1171
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:18,386
IF I TURN IT OFF, EVEN WHEN HE'S
DOZIN', HE WAKES UP MADDER THAN

1172
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,823
A WET NEST OF HORNETS.

1173
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:26,495
I WANNA GO TO THE ZOO.

1174
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:31,466
WE'RE ALREADY THERE, BABY.

1175
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:47,949
OH, ONE OF MY PATIENTS
STARTED THIS SUPPORT GROUP

1176
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,452
FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS.

1177
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:55,524
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU AND CLYDE
COULD TRY ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS.

1178
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:58,627
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CLYDE WILL
GET OUT OF IT, BUT IT MIGHT

1179
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,363
HELP YOU.

1180
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:04,099
WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO SIT
THERE AND TALK WITH A BUNCH

1181
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,200
OF QUEERS?

1182
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,370
TRY IT. THIS DISEASE IS TOO
MUCH TO CARRY ALONE.

1183
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,472
HELL, I AIN'T CARRYIN' IT
ALONE.

1184
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,107
EVERYONE IN THIS HOLLER KNOWS.

1185
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,976
I WISH THEY DIDN'T, BUT THEY DO.

1186
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,947
HEY, DOC, YOU EVER SEEN ONE 
OF THESE?

1187
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,215
IT'S CALLED HEARTS A-BUSTIN'.

1188
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:27,422
IT'S ALSO CALLED SWAMP DOGWOOD,
BUT I DON'T CARE FOR THAT MUCH.

1189
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:30,458
HEARTS A-BUSTIN'.

1190
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,496
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW I FEEL
SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENIN'

1191
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:38,633
TO ME.

1192
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:12,601
ABRAHAM, YOU'VE GOT IT NOW.

1193
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,409
NO, NO.

1194
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:56,278
( screaming )
 I'M A DOCTOR.

1195
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:09,557
A SCIENTIST TRAINED IN
PROFESSIONAL DETACHMENT.

1196
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:15,063
ALL THE USUAL POSTURES SEEM LIKE
A JOKE IN THE FACE OF AIDS.

1197
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:18,233
SOMETIMES, I FIND MYSELF
THINKING, WHAT IF I WAS

1198
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,735
A CARDIAC SURGEON?

1199
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,438
WHAT IF I EARNED A MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR?

1200
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:27,409
WHAT IF I WAS A RADIOLOGIST
WHO PIPES MUSIC THROUGH INTO

1201
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:32,247
HIS OFFICE, AND HAS A GAME OF
GOLF READY FOR HIM EVERY

1202
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,518
AFTERNOON AT THE COUNTRY CLUB?

1203
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,521
YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE,
ABRAHAM?

1204
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:43,325
I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS PART OF
CHRIST'S INTERVENTION, THAT WHEN

1205
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:48,096
WE CAME TO JOHNSON CITY FOR
TREATMENT, WE FOUND YOU.

1206
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:58,173
TO US, YOU'RE LIKE A MESSENGER
FROM ANOTHER WORLD.

1207
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:08,216
TO US, YOU'RE LIKE A MESSENGER
FROM ANOTHER WORLD.

1208
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:17,459
MY LIFE IS SLIPPING DOWNHILL
FASTER THAN I CAN HANDLE.

1209
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:24,065
I CAN'T SEEM TO JUGGLE IT
ANYMORE.

1210
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:27,235
MY CASELOAD.

1211
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:32,073
MY WIFE.

1212
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,843
MY SANITY.

1213
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:38,780
RAJANI TREATS AIDS LIKE IT'S
A MISTRESS THAT'S TAKING ME AWAY

1214
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:50,325
FROM HOME, SO I CAN'T EVEN
TALK ABOUT IT WHEN I'M AT HOME.

1215
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:58,533
I FEEL AS TAINTED BY THIS
DISEASE AS MY PATIENTS ARE.

1216
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:04,806
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME HERE
TWO YEARS AGO, I...

1217
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:09,644
I FINALLY THOUGHT I'D FOUND
MY OWN COUNTRY.

1218
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:15,884
NOWADAYS, DEATH SURROUNDS ME.

1219
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:19,687
ALL THE JOY HAS DISAPPEARED.

1220
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:28,363
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1221
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:33,134
I MYSELF HAVE LOST ALL LIBIDO.

1222
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:41,609
WHAT WAS ONCE AN ACT OF LOVE
AND JOY...

1223
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:47,615
AN ACT OF LIFE,
HAS BECOME AN ACT OF DEATH

1224
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,918
FOR ME.

1225
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,354
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME NOW...

1226
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:59,594
BUT HORROR.

1227
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:18,313
( sobbing )
 ( Indian music playing )

1228
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:21,609
( crying )
 YOUR PATIENT VICKIE CALLED

1229
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,555
AN HOUR AGO.

1230
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,590
HER HUSBAND CLYDE...

1231
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:39,661
JUST PASSED AWAY.

1232
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:47,502
I COULD THINK ONLY OF ALL
THE INEVITABLE CALLS TO COME,

1233
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,505
AND I WANTED TO RUN.

1234
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,282
I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO THE MAN
FOR SO LONG, GOD, I COULD READ

1235
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:04,285
HIS MIND.

1236
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:08,456
I SAID, "IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

1237
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,459
GO ON. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1238
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:13,361
GOD LOVES YA.

1239
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,797
GO ON, CLYDE."

1240
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:19,300
AND THEN, HE OPENED HIS EYES
AS IF HE'D SEEN OR HEARD

1241
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:29,677
SOMETHING RIGHT ABOVE HIM,
AND, OH, THAT WAS IT.

1242
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,946
I WANNA THANK YOU, DOC.

1243
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:37,085
GOD, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE
FOR ME.

1244
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,420
OH, VICKIE.

1245
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:40,822
VICKIE, VICKIE.

1246
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:43,524
VICKIE.

1247
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:47,528
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SOMEONE I'VE
THOUGHT OF AS A PATIENT I'M PAID

1248
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,932
TO HELP.

1249
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:57,772
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE LIKE
A SISTER TO ME.

1250
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:01,743
A VERY BRAVE SISTER.

1251
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:10,718
WELL, WE ALL GOTTA DIE
SOMETIME, RIGHT?

1252
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,489
HMM.

1253
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:30,705
OH, GOOD TO SEE YOU!

1254
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,674
OH, YES!

1255
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:35,076
DR. VERGHESE, I'D LIKE YOU TO
MEET MY GRANDDAUGHTER

1256
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:36,644
WILHELMINA.

1257
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:37,845
HELLO, WILHELMINA.

1258
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:42,083
HI. CAN I GO IN AND SEE
GRANDDAD?

1259
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:47,955
HE'S WAITIN' FOR YOU. GO ON.

1260
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,957
I TOLD THEM.

1261
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,759
I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH.

1262
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,394
YOUR SON AND DAUGHTER?

1263
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:54,929
YES.

1264
01:28:54,962 --> 01:29:00,001
I DIDN'T WANT LLOYD TO DIE ALONE
WITHOUT OUR FAMILY BY HIS SIDE,

1265
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:01,869
SO I MADE THE DECISION.

1266
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,538
DIDN'T TELL HIM.

1267
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:05,173
WENT TO THE PHONE AND CALLED.

1268
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:08,543
COME IN AND MEET THEM.

1269
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:19,654
I THINK I'M READY TO GO HOME,
ABRAHAM.

1270
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:22,957
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

1271
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:34,102
DR. VERGHESE, WE APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU DO HERE.

1272
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:38,639
IT'S JUST THAT, AIDS PATIENTS
ARE SUCH A BIG DRAIN ON

1273
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,541
OUR FUNDS.

1274
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:47,515
THIS CHESTER MEWS, FOR EXAMPLE,
COST US $85,000.

1275
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:50,685
THE LIST DOES GO ON.

1276
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,721
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT
PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE SO

1277
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,824
MANY AIDS PATIENTS IS BECAUSE
OF YOUR REPUTATION?

1278
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,660
ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE TURN
THEM DOWN?

1279
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:03,097
AS A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
WHICH TAKES PUBLIC FUNDS,

1280
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,032
ARE YOU NOT OBLIGED TO ACCEPT...

1281
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,803
NO, I'M NOT SAYIN' WE SHOULD
TURN THEM DOWN.

1282
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:11,572
I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD
GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO ATTRACT

1283
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:13,608
THEM, EITHER.

1284
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:17,812
DR. VERGHESE, YOU'VE DRAWN
PATIENTS FROM THREE DIFFERENT

1285
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:20,114
STATES TO THIS HOSPITAL.

1286
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:24,685
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE 82 CASES
IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE MIDDLE

1287
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:25,820
OF NOWHERE.

1288
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:29,157
IN FIVE YEARS' TIME, YOU'LL BE
LOOKING AT 600 CASES,

1289
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,259
AND THEY WON'T ALL BE GAY.

1290
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:33,628
AND WHEN THIS DISEASE STARTS
KILLING STRAIGHT PEOPLE,

1291
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:38,733
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.

1292
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:42,970
LET'S SEE. LET'S SEE IF AIDS
JUST DISAPPEARS LIKE THEY HOPE

1293
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,105
IT WILL.

1294
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,574
THEY ACTUALLY THINK I'M BRINGING
AIDS TO THEIR HOSPITAL,

1295
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,876
DISRUPTING THEIR PRECIOUS
BOTTOM LINE, THEIR BIRTHING

1296
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:52,046
SUITES, THEIR ONE-DAY SURGERY
CENTER, THEIR HIGH-TECH

1297
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:56,584
MONEY-MAKING RUBBISH!

1298
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:59,520
JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT A PROFIT
CENTER, MY PATIENTS SIMPLY

1299
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,022
DON'T MATTER.

1300
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:04,725
HELL, IN OTHER HOSPITALS, THEY
GOT... THEY GOT WHOLE TEAMS

1301
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:06,027
OF DOCTORS.

1302
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:13,301
HERE, I'M TREATING 82 PATIENTS
ON MY BLOODY OWN!

1303
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:16,003
RELAX, DOC.

1304
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:18,139

1305

I DIDN'T KNOW.

1312
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:53,774
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW DEVASTATED
I WOULD FEEL TO WATCH MY

1313
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,910
PATIENTS DIE.

1314
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:57,678
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

1315
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:01,249
TAKE A BREAK, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

1316
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:07,355

I DON'T BLAME YOU, DOC.

I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DO IT
DAY AFTER DAY.

1319

HELL, I BLOW AN ENGINE, IT
BREAKS MY HEART, AND IT'S JUST

1320

01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:07,468
HI.

1363
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:09,804
HIYA, SADIE. WHAT'S NEW?

1364
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:12,339
WELL, LAST NIGHT, I WENT OUT
AND GOT MYSELF A LITTLE BLACK

1365
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:15,242
DRESS. CREPE NUMBER.

1366
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:17,978
THAT'S WHAT'S NEW?

1367
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:22,983
I HAVE THIS MIRROR ON MY
CEILING, AND I LOOKED AT MYSELF

1368
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:24,985
IN IT.

1369
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:30,057
DAMN, IT MADE ME HOT.

1370
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:40,067
I'M IN THE PHONE BOOK.

1371
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:51,145
I FELT LIKE A DEATH CAMP
INMATE.

1372
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:55,883
IN THIS SETTING, WHAT DID 
A FRIENDLY FLING...

1373
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:59,320
A QUICKIE, MATTER?

1374
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:06,060
( muttering ) CAROL.

1375
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,395
CAROL.

1376
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,264
YES, SIR.

1377
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,166
DO YOU HAVE YOUR CAR TODAY?

1378
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:13,601
UH-HUH. WHY?

1379
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:15,302
WILL YOU DRIVE ME?

1380
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,005
I WANT TO TAKE ALL THE PATIENT
RECORDS HOME.

1381
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:19,206
WHY?

1382
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,575
CAROL, HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
WHERE OUR 80-ODD PATIENTS

1383
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,277
HAVE COME FROM?

1384
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,546
UH-UH. I CAN'T SAY I HAVE.

1385
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:26,981
THINK ABOUT IT.

1386
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:29,316
TWO YEARS AGO, THERE WAS NO AIDS
IN THESE PARTS.

1387
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,519
THE ENTIRE GAY POPULATION 
TESTED NEGATIVE.

1388
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,187
SO?

1389
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:38,959
SO, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I HAVE
A HUNCH, I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

1390
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:40,327
YEAH.

1391
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:43,898
YEAH!

1392
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:46,834
ALL THOUGHTS OF THE LITTLE
BLACK DRESS HAD FADED.

1393
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:34,515
ABRAHAM.

1394
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:38,552
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

1395
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:41,255
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

1396
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:44,959
I'VE JUST DISCOVERED A PARADIGM
WHICH MIGHT BE TRUE FOR OTHER

1397
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:46,160
RURAL AREAS, AS WELL.

1398
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:49,663
HIV IN TENNESSEE IS LARGELY AN
IMPORTED DISEASE, IMPORTED

1399
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:50,898
TO THE COUNTRY FROM THE CITY.

1400
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:54,602
IMPORTED BY NATIVE SONS WHO
LEFT LONG AGO AND THEN RETURNED

1401
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:58,973
HOME TO DIE.

1402
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:01,675
I'VE JUST HAMMERED OUT A PAPER
WHICH I'M SENDING TO THE

1403
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,310
JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

1404
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:13,087
ABRAHAM, I WANT US TO GO IN
FOR COUNSELING.

1405
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:24,698
RAJANI, RAJANI, I WANT US TO
LEAVE TENNESSEE.

1406
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:28,002
THANKS.

1407
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:33,173
I'M BEGINNIN' TO BELIEVE I WAS
GIVEN THIS DISEASE FOR A REASON.

1408
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:36,677
I MEAN, I WAS JUST THIS
EVERY-DAY TYPICAL HOUSEWIFE,

1409
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:39,313
AND NOW, WOW!

1410
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:40,648
I'M ON THE BOARD OF TAP.

1411
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:42,016

1413
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:48,255
I KNOW THAT I HAVE THIS TIME
BOMB WAITIN' TO BLOW UP IN ME,

1414
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:51,458
BUT I CAN'T LET IT RUIN MY LIFE.

1415
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:54,995
AFTER I LOST CLYDE, I'M NOT
A-SCARED OF DEATH ONE BIT.

1416
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:58,165
WHEN IT COMES, I'LL DEAL
WITH IT.
