1
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,438
What is this whiny crap
we're listenin' to?

2
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,370
Rawlins, you suck, man.

3
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,385
They gay bar's
across the street!

4
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:01,017
I bet she still sings
better than you!

5
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:13,912
Don't know what he's playin'.
Is that guitar in tune?

6
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,833
To top that,
he looks like he's 12.

7
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,913
He's a little boy.

8
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,185
He walks in here
trying to be tough

9
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,522
with the leather jacket
and boots.

10
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,504
And then he's singin'
about love.

11
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,248
He probably ain't even
been laid yet.

12
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,920
He sings like that, he won't be
gettin' laid any time soon.

13
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,641
<b>LAND OF LEOPOLD</b>

14
00:03:56,642 --> 00:04:02,943
<b>LAND OF LEOPOLD
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

15
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,098
<i>The cards dealt to me
were rags.</i>

16
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,226
<i>All I saw in my hands
was pain and violence.</i>

17
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:28,345
<i>I wanted to escape
what my father did.</i>

18
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,432
<i>If I didn't...</i>

19
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:32,730
<i>I would end up the person
I despised the most.</i>

20
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:37,338
<i>Growing up,
nothing was simple.</i>

21
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,895
<i>My mom was always gone...</i>

22
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:41,656
<i>on the road performing.</i>

23
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:50,233
<i>We would talk
through letters often...</i>

24
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:52,249
<i>but only see her
once in a while.</i>

25
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:57,017
<i>I got to spend
most of my time with Dad.</i>

26
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,584
<i>Well...</i>

27
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,984
<i>you can guess
what life with him was like.</i>

28
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:07,448
<i>Drank himself near to death
before he grabbed that gun...</i>

29
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,073
<i>killed Mom and himself.</i>

30
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,561
<i>So I ran...</i>

31
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,961
<i>away from the world.</i>

32
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,807
<i>I tried to shut it
out of my mind,</i>

33
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,791
<i>but the images never left.</i>

34
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,400
-Morning, Michael.
-Morning, Reggie.

35
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,872
Reggie, do you know
what time it is?

36
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,753
We're already short of staff
as it is.

37
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,448
Your tray's
on the counter there.

38
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,857
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:05,719
[footsteps approaching

40
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,087
Morning, beautiful.

41
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,103
Morning, Reggie.

42
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:12,183
You have my stuff?

43
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,344
The other stuff.

44
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,129
Come on, Reggie,
we made a deal.

45
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,360
If I find out
you're skipping your meds...

46
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,936
You're the best.

47
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,511
Kisses.

48
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:36,984
Don't get caught this time.

49
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,360
Can you dare imagine
what it must be like

50
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,568
to stand at the foot
of the great beast...

51
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,318
between you and the hot
flesh, only a sliver of steel?

52
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,344
Emphasis!

53
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:54,168
If you're going to play
in one of my productions,

54
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,319
professionalism,
embody it!

55
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,304
Closed rehearsals!
Go away!

56
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,447
You're disrupting
the tranquility.

57
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,918
Come on, Francis,
you gotta take your meds

58
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:02,583
just like everybody else, man.

59
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:07,192
Okay, everyone.
Take five.

60
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,023
Where's Cal?

61
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,464
Stepped out.

62
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:14,583
Places, class!

63
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,951
Objectives, obstacles,
intent, triggers.

64
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,391
What are they?!

65
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,152
Corrina!

66
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:21,686
You guys are
really quiet today.

67
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:22,934
Shut up.

68
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,576
Corrina, you make me so happy!

69
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,463
When my skies are gray!

70
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:30,359
Cal!

71
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,248
Get down from there!

72
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,711
Not until Corrina accepts me
as her soulmate!

73
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,151
She knows it.

74
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:37,432
It's her destiny.

75
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:39,863
Cal, just get down already,
man.

76
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:40,854
No!

77
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,968
He doin' the roof thing again?

78
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,207
He's obsessed with you.

79
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,871
This shit gotta end.

80
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:54,359
<i>As far as I can remember
I was a runaway.</i>

81
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,663
<i>No home, no family...</i>

82
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,350
<i>disconnected
from the world...</i>

83
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,304
<i>drifting in and out
of trouble.</i>

84
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,543
<i>A good lawyer
and enough money</i>

85
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,271
<i>can get you out of anything.</i>

86
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:07,766
<i>A so-so public defender</i>

87
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,750
<i>and three dollars
in your pocket...</i>

88
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:10,999
<i>well...</i>

89
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,719
<i>that'll get you 12 months.</i>

90
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,606
<i>I did a year
at Northridge Penitentiary</i>

91
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,646
<i>for beatin' the grin
off that face.</i>

92
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,270
<i>Northridge proved to be
a real hellhole.</i>

93
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:25,207
<i>But before the State
threw me back on the streets,</i>

94
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,871
<i>they sent me
to a halfway house</i>

95
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:28,503
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

96
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,590
<i>It was for people
who didn't fit in...</i>

97
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:41,879
<i>in other words, those who
are mentally unstable.</i>

98
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,375
Come on down here
before I whoop your ass!

99
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:46,647
Are you serious?

100
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,023
Corrina!

101
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:50,935
I love you so much!
Boom!

102
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,087
<i>The first person I saw</i>

103
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:53,367
<i>when I got there
was Cal.</i>

104
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,838
Try this.

105
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,847
Corrina!

106
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,246
That's hospital property!

107
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,358
<i>He wasn't what you'd call...</i>

108
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,638
<i>a big supporter of the arts.</i>

109
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,630
That's it.

110
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,325
I'm comin' up there
and gettin' your ass, man.

111
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,038
Ignore him and he'll have
no one to jump for.

112
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:15,318
Hey, Reggie, it looks like
we got ourselves another one!

113
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,030
He looks sad...

114
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,942
but in a kinda cute way.

115
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:07,989
18, she's legal.

116
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:09,879
Damn.

117
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:13,621
So... have a seat here.

118
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,382
Dr. Warren will see you
when he's ready.

119
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,406
All right?

120
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,261
News now, Pete.

121
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,366
It ain't good.

122
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,927
We gotta move on, partner.

123
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:30,134
You're next in line.

124
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:34,101
What's the compensation?

125
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,285
It's like this.

126
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,790
The State's check isn't nearly
as sweet as an insurance claim.

127
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:45,141
I don't know how I feel
about this.

128
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:48,374
It doesn't make a damn
how you feel about it, Deece.

129
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,902
The State board
doesn't bargain.

130
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:52,949
What's your take?

131
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:56,757
50 percent.

132
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,598
That's a hefty take.

133
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,061
You ain't got
anything else, pal.

134
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,205
I'm your only ally.

135
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:09,110
Small State contractors
like you...

136
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:12,629
don't cut it anymore.

137
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:16,118
If Northridge takes
your psycho clients...

138
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,334
you can forget it.

139
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,894
I got your back...

140
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:23,093
as long as you live up
to your end of the deal.

141
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:27,573
You could be livin' high,
my old friend.

142
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,550
You could be livin' high.

143
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:46,837
What's it like...

144
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,588
to kill?

145
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:54,325
E.O.P. at Northridge
for a year...

146
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,716
It says that...

147
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,510
you're a violent type...

148
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,269
a convicted criminal.

149
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,340
Says you're prone
to running away?

150
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,230
I like the exercise.

151
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:08,820
Ain't nothing' wrong with that.

152
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:12,149
Yeah... but don't get
any ideas...

153
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,549
'cause nature
around these parts...

154
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:16,694
ain't too forgivin'
to city folk.

155
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,733
You know, you could've,
joined the service

156
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,973
and put that anger to good use.

157
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:23,638
Rejected.

158
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,389
They think I'm nuts.

159
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,300
I didn't even kill anybody.

160
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,789
Seriously injuring people
is your thing?

161
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:33,973
Well...

162
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,797
there'll be none of that
here.

163
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:38,486
Get me?

164
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,565
Get me?!

165
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,381
-Get it.
-Good.

166
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:48,148
Give me those.

167
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,421
Maybe you can earn 'em back.

168
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,341
If you follow the rules,
that is.

169
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,893
And those fancy sunglasses too.

170
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,005
Your shoes.

171
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,501
Any other contraband
I should know about?

172
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:13,972
That's it, Doc.

173
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,444
I told you not to call me that.

174
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,325
You're lucky to be here.

175
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,116
You might want to take
advantage of the opportunity

176
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,780
before it's too late.

177
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,637
Too late for what?

178
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,715
Your file must be signed by me

179
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:31,220
and approved by the State

180
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,045
before release.

181
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,389
You mess up here,

182
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,629
you go right back
to Northridge,

183
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,860
and you can kiss all your
rockstar dreams goodbye.

184
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,364
This is my rodeo...

185
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,229
and you're late
for group meeting.

186
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,668
Reggie'll show you the way.

187
00:13:58,227 --> 00:13:59,379
The pen.

188
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:00,308
Nurse.

189
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,100
Frank, hand it over.

190
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,821
Are you incompetent?

191
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,677
Don't you see he's just
pining for attention?

192
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,148
-Cal, please wait...
-Nurse Verona?

193
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,676
This is Leopold Rawlins.

194
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,916
Hello, Leopold.
Please join us.

195
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:14,325
Leopold.

196
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:20,404
Leopold, why don't you introduce
yourself to the group?

197
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:21,589
Not today.

198
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,540
Well, it is customary
for new patients to...

199
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,333
Nurse Verona, is it?

200
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,851
Not today.

201
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,308
Very well.
Tomorrow you can share.

202
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,004
Why do we gotta bring
another queer to the group?

203
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,051
That's enough, Cal.

204
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,939
Okay, now, Mary Bell,

205
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,563
are you still having
the nightmare?

206
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,388
No, not anymore.

207
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,476
Good!

208
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,644
Positive reinforcement
through negative association.

209
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,115
That's what we covered
last week.

210
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:49,460
I do have a new dream, though.

211
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:50,419
Really?

212
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,947
It's about a bow tie

213
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,188
that wraps itself
around my neck...

214
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,948
softly...

215
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,827
slowly, and it tightens

216
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,939
until I'm on the verge
of death,

217
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,987
and then it loosens just enough

218
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,355
so that I can feel
the warm air

219
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:08,467
tease my cold lungs,

220
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,027
and then it tightens
back up again.

221
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,075
And it does this
over, and over, and over,

222
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:15,283
and over, and over,
and over again until...

223
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,851
until I finally wake up.

224
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,195
Good, improvement.

225
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,210
-Improvement?
-I like that last one better.

226
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,164
We'll open up the floor
when we finish with Mary Bell.

227
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,698
You need to learn how to lead.

228
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,555
Cal, this is your second
and last warning!

229
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:27,860
For fuck's sake!
She's making these dreams up!

230
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,875
My God, could you be
any more fucking dim-witted?

231
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:31,347
I'm not finished yet,
Nurse Verona.

232
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:32,338
I know.

233
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,060
I'm not finished yet!

234
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,627
-Ern.
-Yeah, Ern!

235
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,354
If I have to
stop this session one...

236
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,922
What?
You're gonna do what?

237
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:41,780
I'm not finished yet!

238
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:47,923
Go on.

239
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,595
I wanna fuck you
in the bathroom.

240
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:53,811
No.

241
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,179
-I like it on the sink.
-Shit everywhere.

242
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:57,747
That is
extremely inappropriate.

243
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,668
Good grief,
what is going on with...

244
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,331
Old hag!

245
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:03,122
I'll light your pussies
on fire.

246
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:06,068
All of 'em. They're burning
in the shit box as we speak.

247
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,314
Meow.

248
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:09,523
Meow. Meow.

249
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,636
<i>This was the circus...</i>

250
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,747
<i>and that's how
I met Corrina.</i>

251
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:14,898
<i>I didn't know who she was,</i>

252
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:17,203
<i>but there was something
about her.</i>

253
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:19,188
<i>I wanted to find out more.</i>

254
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,323
<i>Being out here
in the middle of nowhere</i>

255
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:24,372
<i>kind of forced you
to connect with one another</i>

256
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,548
<i>and clear up your thoughts.</i>

257
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:29,427
<i>I started thinking more
about my family.</i>

258
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,603
<i>Seeing my parents die
at a young age</i>

259
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:33,138
<i>was a hard thing to shake.</i>

260
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,058
<i>All I had from my mother</i>

261
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,098
<i>was a few letters
and this photograph.</i>

262
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,794
She's gorgeous.

263
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,386
I was gonna be a mother.

264
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,171
I grew up on this...

265
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,899
artists' commune...

266
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:55,668
and all we did all day
and all night was paint...

267
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:58,899
and time didn't exist...

268
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:01,363
and there was never
enough of it.

269
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,275
I can barely remember
what that feels like.

270
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,131
My life's always going in...

271
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:08,531
opposite directions.

272
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:09,716
What do you mean?

273
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:11,635
It's just not...

274
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:13,618
easy.

275
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:15,476
Fate's heavy on some.

276
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,947
When...

277
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:23,059
When Grandma found out
that I was coming...

278
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,483
she made this quilt
for my mom...

279
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,915
and it was covered
in caterpillars.

280
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:32,689
My mom used to wrap me in it...

281
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:35,473
and sing me to sleep,
and she told me...

282
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:37,298
that one day
I would do the same...

283
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:39,282
but then...

284
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,875
I snagged it on a tree...

285
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:45,011
and she got mad...

286
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,834
'cause it started to unravel.

287
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:54,739
Sometimes things, they...

288
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,658
they just don't fit
like they should.

289
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,778
<i>"To my Leo...</i>

290
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:12,530
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

291
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,497
<i>Everyone says
you're gonna grow</i>

292
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,546
<i>into such a handsome man.</i>

293
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:23,219
<i>Do you like the new guitar
I sent you?</i>

294
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:28,081
<i>There's something new and fun
to learn every day.</i>

295
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,963
<i>The best part of life
is what we don't expect.</i>

296
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:35,442
<i>Music has taken me
far and wide...</i>

297
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:37,745
<i>sometimes, to the other side
of the world...</i>

298
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,306
<i>but remember...</i>

299
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,419
<i>even if I'm not close by...</i>

300
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:44,690
<i>I know that
I'm always with you.</i>

301
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:49,266
<i>We live our life in stages.</i>

302
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:51,889
<i>When one ends,
another one begins.</i>

303
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,530
<i>Change is constant...</i>

304
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:58,578
<i>and life is short.</i>

305
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,362
<i>Seize every moment...</i>

306
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:02,706
<i>every breath.</i>

307
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:08,051
<i>I'll be back soon,
my baby boy.</i>

308
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,505
<i>I miss you
more than words.</i>

309
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:14,289
<i>Love, Mom."</i>

310
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:22,705
Baby giraffe.

311
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,433
Gazelle, gazelle, gazelle.

312
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,985
<i>Francis was a novelty.</i>

313
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:31,441
<i>He liked games
and kept the morale high.</i>

314
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:32,754
<i>I figured...</i>

315
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,226
<i>he was in pretty deep.</i>

316
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,241
How're you likin' the place
so far?

317
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,121
Are you thinkin' about
makin' a run for it?

318
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:53,746
Here's your pen.

319
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:56,369
Keep it.

320
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:00,946
You want to be friends?

321
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:08,625
Go get the keys
and un-cuff me.

322
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,354
I'm the boss.

323
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:11,889
Yeah, I heard you the
first time, you fucking loon-o.

324
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:13,746
Now go get the goddamn keys.

325
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,658
They left you hangin'?

326
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:20,178
Reggie, Reggie told me
to watch him.

327
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,234
I'm the boss.

328
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:24,433
No, Eddie, no you're not...

329
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:25,521
Make good use of yourself

330
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:27,953
and rinse this cup out for me,
would you please, Eddie?

331
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:34,930
Thanks.

332
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,409
Where in the hell
are you getting these blades?

333
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,944
I don't have it anymore.

334
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:56,529
Why are you doing this, Callum?

335
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:58,673
Why?

336
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:02,448
You know I'm gonna have to have
your room searched.

337
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,594
I'm fine.

338
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:07,122
Why'd they cuff you?

339
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,041
Look, they just cuffed me here.
All right?

340
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,536
I don't believe that.
Not for a second.

341
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,801
It was Verona.

342
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:17,296
Don't worry about staff issues.
All right?

343
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,153
-Mr. Deece?
-No.

344
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:20,561
So, you gonna un-cuff me
already?

345
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,665
I mean, this is...
This is probably illegal.

346
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,385
-Mr. Deece.
-Eddie, I said...

347
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,753
Th-there's someone
here to see you.

348
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:31,568
What can I do for you?

349
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,128
Why is that patient
handcuffed to the chair?

350
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,408
That's what I wanna know.

351
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,265
I'm sorry. You are...?

352
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,480
Catherine Windgate,

353
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:41,040
State Inspector
assigned to Milton Way.

354
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:42,321
I'm looking for
the clinical director,

355
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:43,248
Dr. Warren.

356
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,000
Well then, look no further.
I'm Dr. Warren.

357
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,016
I've been assigned
by the board to...

358
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:50,032
assess your establishment.

359
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:52,273
Very well...

360
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:55,761
Whatever you need,
I'm always here to help and...

361
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:58,705
I'm, sorry about
this little mix-up here.

362
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:00,943
Eddie, go grab the keys for me,
would you?

363
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:02,095
Okay.

364
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,761
Go.

365
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,296
Okay, Dr. Warren...

366
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,217
We'll be in touch.

367
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:08,623
Okay.

368
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:09,809
Take care.

369
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,849
I'll be damned

370
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,544
if I don't pass this place on.

371
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:17,776
<i>300k is big money.</i>

372
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:19,568
<i>Enough to hang your hat on
for good.</i>

373
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,545
<i>Just make sure it looks
like an accident.</i>

374
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:26,416
We'll see.
We'll see.

375
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,073
But please, you try
to stall 'em on your end.

376
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,185
<i>That's more like it.</i>

377
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,624
I gotta go.

378
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,120
Thanks, Frank.

379
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,424
Those bastards, they never
give me more than two.

380
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,601
How's the new boy toy?

381
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:10,672
You're gonna let him
get away with that?

382
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:25,647
Don't.

383
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:27,759
It's okay.

384
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,960
Can I help you?

385
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:40,847
If you wanted seconds...

386
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,160
you should've just asked.

387
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,208
Fuck!

388
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,479
Again, people?

389
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:03,984
Sir, it was the new guy,
Leopold.

390
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:05,743
He just threw a try of food
at me for no reason.

391
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,695
He's lying, Dr. Warren.

392
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,264
Why are you stickin' up
for him?

393
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,175
Your first day, Leopold...

394
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,671
and you're already
on thin ice.

395
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,751
Look, it was an accident.

396
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,319
I dropped my tray.

397
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,679
Maybe you do wanna go back
where you came from?

398
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,007
Maybe I'm headed there already.

399
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,767
Leopold will clean this up,
Reggie.

400
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:32,752
Busted.

401
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:33,967
Cal, you'll be joining him.

402
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,183
W-wait!

403
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,056
All right.
Clean 'em off,

404
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:42,479
then lights out,
except for those two.

405
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,720
And make sure they get the best cleaning
equipment we've got, all right?

406
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,999
I'm gonna keep my eye on 'em.

407
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:48,240
All the stunts and charades
end today.

408
00:24:57,774 --> 00:24:59,759
I can tell who's real
and who's not.

409
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:02,959
Ain't no room
for faggots here...

410
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,463
Not on my watch.

411
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,694
Stay clear of Corrina.
She's mine.

412
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,120
She always has been.

413
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,758
I'll do what I want.

414
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,038
You think so?

415
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,782
Whatcha lookin' at?

416
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:27,311
Nothin'.

417
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,871
Fucking bitch!

418
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,182
You want what you want?!

419
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:12,590
Is this what you want?!

420
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:13,806
Give it to me!

421
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,502
What are you afraid of?!

422
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,167
What are you afraid...

423
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,838
What happened to that broom,
Rawlins?

424
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,983
It was an accident.

425
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,487
Another accident?

426
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:37,647
You two, get up to your rooms.

427
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:40,910
<i>I saw myself in Cal.</i>

428
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:46,574
<i>Somewhere inside
when I was young...</i>

429
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:51,055
<i>without a home...
without a friend.</i>

430
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:55,630
<i>Deece was trying hard
for his son...</i>

431
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,486
<i>but Cal was so damaged.</i>

432
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:00,813
<i>My mom's letters
were the only memory</i>

433
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:03,375
<i>of what having a family
felt like.</i>

434
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:08,047
<i>"Leo... I'm missin' you.</i>

435
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:10,477
<i>I think about you
growing up.</i>

436
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:13,614
<i>I think about your music.</i>

437
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:15,727
<i>I loved your last letter.</i>

438
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,182
<i>I know it's tough
without me there.</i>

439
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,790
<i>I wish I could
ease your mind.</i>

440
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:26,702
<i>I know I'm gettin' older.</i>

441
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:32,142
<i>No one is around forever.</i>

442
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:34,606
<i>Just remember
how special you are...</i>

443
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,622
<i>to see the good in people.</i>

444
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,830
<i>Look for the beauty
in the world.</i>

445
00:27:41,486 --> 00:27:43,982
<i>There are bad people, but...</i>

446
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:45,997
<i>you're not bad.</i>

447
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:48,718
<i>You come from a good place.</i>

448
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,781
<i>Remember...</i>

449
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:59,534
<i>even if I'm not
next to you...</i>

450
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,973
<i>I'm always with you.</i>

451
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,142
<i>I hope you know
I'm comin' for you soon...</i>

452
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,670
<i>like I always said.</i>

453
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,549
<i>And now...</i>

454
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:11,597
<i>I'm close.</i>

455
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:15,022
<i>Everything's going to be okay.</i>

456
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,550
<i>Love... Mom."</i>

457
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:20,142
[distant train horn.

458
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,669
This is my favorite place...

459
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:33,133
my little sanctuary.

460
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,925
What's on your arm?

461
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,517
Words...

462
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:52,398
to a song.

463
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,765
How's it go?

464
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:56,846
Not finished yet.

465
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:00,429
I'd like to hear it
when you're done.

466
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:06,829
They're gonna be free.

467
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:12,109
I'm thinking about escaping.

468
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,276
Maybe tonight.

469
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:18,860
Maybe tomorrow.

470
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:20,877
Maybe next year.

471
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:23,757
Maybe tonight?

472
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,725
I'm all better now.

473
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,805
Promise this stays between us.

474
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,253
Milton Way is shutting down.

475
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:47,181
They're sending all of us
to Northridge.

476
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:50,700
I ain't goin' back
to Northridge

477
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,206
no matter what.

478
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:03,949
I know my lines.
I'm a tiger.

479
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,453
You know your lines.
Lines are all over you.

480
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:06,957
You should be in the...
in the zoo,

481
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:08,525
not the movie business!

482
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,573
Dinner in 30 minutes!

483
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:17,773
What's on the menu
tonight, garçon?

484
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:20,460
Rice stew,
same as every Monday night.

485
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:25,004
And ain't it the best rice stew
this side of sane?

486
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:26,477
You don't tell me shit.

487
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:28,076
I'm the master here.

488
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,677
You're the apprentice.
Hey.

489
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,566
Hi.

490
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:37,676
Your use of monochromatics
continues to impress, Cor-Cor.

491
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:38,892
You should hang it up
in the entrance.

492
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,485
Can't.
Milton Way is no more.

493
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:43,179
It's Northridge
from here on in.

494
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:44,365
Right, Leopold?

495
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,468
Do they have paints
at Northridge?

496
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:50,156
Okay, listen.

497
00:30:50,187 --> 00:30:52,172
Promise this stays
between us three.

498
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,116
We got no one else to tell.

499
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:57,675
It's a prison.

500
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,821
No paints, no music...

501
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:01,676
That sounds like exaggeration.

502
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:03,660
Sounds like an exaggeration?

503
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:12,013
Hospitals are moving patients...

504
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,412
into prisons.

505
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:17,068
It's not somewhere
you wanna be.

506
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:18,316
I know where I'm headed.

507
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,485
Where?

508
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:24,011
Anywhere but there.

509
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:27,629
Listen...

510
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,509
I know these parts pretty well.

511
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:32,843
I can draft a plan.

512
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,531
<i>I could've made
my own escape, no problem,</i>

513
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:38,060
<i>but if it meant getting closer
to Corrina...</i>

514
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,195
Okay, let's do it.

515
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:54,157
I love you.
Do you love me, too?

516
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:56,555
<i>I need to speak with Dr.
Warren, please.</i>

517
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,540
Dr. Warren.
I'm sorry.

518
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,268
He was found decapitated.

519
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,451
A stripper cut his head off.

520
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,540
<i>Excuse me?</i>

521
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,492
I know. Tragic.

522
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,155
<i>Is this some sort
of sick joke?</i>

523
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:08,620
<i>Have Dr. Warren
call me immediately.</i>

524
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,708
<i>It's urgent.</i>

525
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,756
Beautiful day at Milton Way.

526
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,556
Who was that, Mary Bell?

527
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,739
God.

528
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:22,315
You are never to answer
this phone again, you hear me?!

529
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:23,629
Never!

530
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,540
God.

531
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,299
It's in the back.

532
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:21,642
<i>Deece had started
selling Milton Way off</i>

533
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:23,084
<i>piece by piece.</i>

534
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:25,130
<i>The debts were
so high, though,</i>

535
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,371
<i>that it wasn't enough.</i>

536
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:30,251
<i>Felt that
the ship was sinkin'</i>

537
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:32,299
<i>but he would never
let anyone know.</i>

538
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:41,323
<i>Corrina would always paint
the same picture.</i>

539
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,827
<i>Sometimes of a young boy</i>

540
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:45,580
<i>and sometimes
of a young girl.</i>

541
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:48,011
<i>I guess that was her way
of imagining</i>

542
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:50,507
<i>what it would be like
to be a mother.</i>

543
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:54,730
<i>Francis had such
a childlike innocence</i>

544
00:33:54,762 --> 00:33:56,650
<i>and imagination about him.</i>

545
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:59,307
<i>He had to be shutting out
his past life very well.</i>

546
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:05,162
<i>He refused to talk
about what got him there...</i>

547
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:06,666
<i>and I never asked.</i>

548
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,514
<i>At Milton Way...</i>

549
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:12,170
<i>the patients created
their own world.</i>

550
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:14,603
<i>They felt safe when they
were able to dream.</i>

551
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:19,403
<i>Deece had done a good job</i>

552
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,195
<i>makin' a home
for these people.</i>

553
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:26,219
Everyone...

554
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,066
Ron, you too.

555
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,115
Good morning, troops.

556
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:34,923
Today... we're gonna go out
on a field trip.

557
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:36,139
All right?
Everybody up!

558
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,370
You like to get it up,
don't you, Deecey Boy?

559
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:42,506
Mary Bell, you stay here.

560
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,138
You look a little peaked.

561
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:46,667
Let's go!

562
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:26,889
I remember the last time
I had to take a hill like this.

563
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:29,899
Why are we out here?

564
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,489
Nothin' like Texas...

565
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:34,091
Nothin'.

566
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:35,658
Is that woman
gonna shut us down?

567
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:40,073
She's a member
of the State board.

568
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:43,339
They've already passed a grant
to renovate our facility.

569
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,290
Why don't we have pizza
and movie night tonight?

570
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:47,530
Reggie, can we move it up?

571
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,938
Sir, good as great.

572
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,474
All right.

573
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,554
Yes, Leopold. You wanna
share something with us?

574
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:55,242
What lies to the north
beyond the river?

575
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:56,074
What do you care?

576
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,201
Past the river there's
the Jenkins' farmland.

577
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,346
The cotton field
and corn fields...

578
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:05,131
used to be an ancient
Indian burial ground.

579
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,906
Before that, it was plains
full of wild buffalo.

580
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:09,801
I think he's talking about

581
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,945
the physical characteristics
of the land.

582
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:13,801
Well,
there's a dense forest,

583
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,722
and there's
the Jenkins' farmland.

584
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:16,874
Then there's another forest.

585
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,698
And beyond that forest?

586
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,137
A spring.

587
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:22,282
I didn't know
there was a spring.

588
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,562
What's after that?

589
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,337
An untamed land.

590
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,729
An untamed land.

591
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:32,585
An untamed land.

592
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:01,610
-Got a minute?
-Not now.

593
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:05,321
Rendezvous in 27 seconds.

594
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:08,649
Yeah.

595
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:11,113
I forgot about
your big concert tonight.

596
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,298
Shut up.

597
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,153
Don't blow our cover.

598
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,913
We're being watched.

599
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,184
Nobody's watching us.

600
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,233
Yeah?
Check out Hawkeye over there.

601
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:21,674
Easy.

602
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,521
No bite.

603
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:25,928
Cal seems onto us.

604
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:28,618
He has it out for you.

605
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:31,146
Anybody Corrina
takes a liking to

606
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:32,713
he automatically targets.

607
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:35,241
Hold this.

608
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:55,210
Hey.

609
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:56,586
Hi.

610
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,944
Operation White Tiger
is in effect.

611
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:05,256
It's now or never.

612
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:07,144
What's "White Tiger"?

613
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:08,745
No time to explain.

614
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:10,537
I'll give the green light
at dinner.

615
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:11,817
This is the spot.

616
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,544
Remember this spot, Leopold.

617
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:15,752
This is where the pillowcases
have to be buried.

618
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:17,640
Pillowcases?

619
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:20,456
Yeah, we need to fill them
with food at dinner.

620
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,561
I'll take care of the rest.

621
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:25,064
Listen...

622
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,920
I've collected
all the information we need.

623
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,864
Thanks, Corrina.

624
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:32,136
We're here,
and we need to get there.

625
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:34,089
In between are obstacles
of all sorts.

626
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,753
Big payoff is just
past the river

627
00:38:35,784 --> 00:38:37,097
at the Jenkins farm,

628
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:39,465
but we gotta make it
past the dragon.

629
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:40,777
Dragon?

630
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:42,792
It's a hound.

631
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:44,520
Dragon.

632
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:45,609
Okay, good.

633
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,054
And since the drought,

634
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:48,174
we might be able to

635
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,257
-make the crossing here...
-Dinner time!

636
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:52,137
...without trouble,
but we gotta book it,

637
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:54,025
'cause the rains are comin'.

638
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:54,856
How do you know?

639
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:57,833
-I heard it on the radio.
-Teddy bear.

640
00:38:58,983 --> 00:38:59,944
Leopold, you do the talking.

641
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:00,841
Hey, what's goin' on, guys?

642
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,369
Here.

643
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,872
just...

644
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:07,241
picking wildflowers...

645
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,192
They're in bloom.

646
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,145
Want one?
Yeah.

647
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:13,256
It's dinner time.
Everybody inside.

648
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:15,303
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

649
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:48,550
Hey.

650
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:49,927
Hey, where's my milk?

651
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,976
I told Reggie
to fill it last night.

652
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,319
Can't sleep without my milk.

653
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:57,480
Come on.
I want warm milk, too.

654
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:20,615
Abort White Tiger.

655
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,527
Abort White Tiger.
I repeat, abort White Tiger!

656
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,287
I put them there.

657
00:42:27,398 --> 00:42:29,255
Double-crossing us?

658
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:31,079
Look, I figured
it would save us the trouble

659
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:32,775
of finding 'em in the dark.

660
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:34,566
Improvising already.

661
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,015
Risky... but smart.

662
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:58,214
<i>I found myself running
once again.</i>

663
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:03,943
<i>This time... with company...</i>

664
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:07,431
<i>a plan, and where to...</i>

665
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:10,983
<i>no one could really be sure.</i>

666
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:14,279
<i>I just knew
if we stayed behind...</i>

667
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,671
<i>it was a one-way trip
to Northridge.</i>

668
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:30,214
The water level's
not that high.

669
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,727
A little muddy...

670
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:44,999
but not that bad.

671
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,886
I could do without the smell.

672
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,886
What a big crazy fucking world.

673
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:01,381
We're only here
for a nanosecond

674
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:02,821
when you think about it.

675
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:06,310
Well, I cannot believe
we're actually doing this.

676
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:08,006
We could always go back.

677
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:09,766
They wouldn't even know
we left.

678
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:13,638
-It is too late.
-No, no one is... going back.

679
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,382
Now is our chance to live free.

680
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:18,374
Free.

681
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:21,541
Free.

682
00:44:21,573 --> 00:44:23,269
Francis...

683
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,510
If you could go anywhere
in the world...

684
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,887
where would you go?

685
00:44:31,622 --> 00:44:32,807
New York.

686
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:35,398
Broadway!

687
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:38,757
Let's do it.
What about you, Corrina?

688
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:44,679
I...

689
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:49,093
I haven't figured out
that one yet.

690
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:51,878
Well...

691
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:55,045
My mother...

692
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:57,733
she was a hell of a
guitarist. She toured...

693
00:44:59,494 --> 00:45:00,678
all over the world.

694
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,925
Told me about gettin' lost
on the streets of Berlin...

695
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:08,197
seeing the lights in Paris...

696
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:13,413
getting fat on pasta and wine
in Italy...

697
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,077
She was free as free can be.

698
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:23,846
I just wanna go
where my music takes me.

699
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:28,549
I could be your song.

700
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:37,382
I'm gonna have to
take a tinkle.

701
00:45:38,885 --> 00:45:40,998
I'll see you guys
in a little bit.

702
00:45:57,252 --> 00:46:00,453
Do you think the stars
are attached by strings...

703
00:46:05,124 --> 00:46:08,549
and if we just... snip 'em,
they would...

704
00:46:09,317 --> 00:46:10,790
fall to the Earth?

705
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,230
I like that.

706
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:24,483
Wha...
Shit! Kneel!

707
00:48:24,516 --> 00:48:26,052
Jenkins' place.

708
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,005
We gotta go around.
No other way.

709
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:31,620
Corrina, come on!

710
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,068
-There he is.
-No!

711
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,116
Scurry.
Go, go, go, go, go!

712
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:05,892
I think he's dozing.

713
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:07,428
Stay light on your feet.

714
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,180
You little bastards!

715
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:25,827
Come back again,
I'll put your ass down!

716
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,292
Stay off of
my fuckin' property!

717
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:29,764
I thought you said
there was a hound!

718
00:49:29,794 --> 00:49:31,684
-Slight miscalculation!
-God!

719
00:49:31,714 --> 00:49:33,732
Blow your god damn head off!

720
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:36,995
Francis, you fucking idiot!

721
00:49:37,027 --> 00:49:37,635
It was a mistake!
I-I-I...

722
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:43,939
We're getting shot at
back here!

723
00:49:44,835 --> 00:49:46,018
You're gonna get us killed!

724
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,043
I never make a mistake!

725
00:49:47,075 --> 00:49:48,131
Yes, you do!

726
00:49:48,163 --> 00:49:48,995
Never!

727
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,499
What are you talking about?!

728
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:02,402
You know, that map of yours
almost got us killed.

729
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:04,484
Almost... but not quite.

730
00:50:04,514 --> 00:50:06,211
Not quite?

731
00:50:06,243 --> 00:50:08,132
Told you to make it good.

732
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:10,884
There are a lot of things wrong
in this world, Leopold...

733
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:15,012
including me.

734
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:16,579
But this map...

735
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:18,370
This map is right,
I'm sure of it.

736
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,243
Let me see this map.

737
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:26,276
It seems wrong.

738
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,066
Well, according to this map,

739
00:50:28,098 --> 00:50:29,922
which is right...

740
00:50:29,954 --> 00:50:31,202
we're close.

741
00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:32,995
Hey, guys!

742
00:50:33,026 --> 00:50:34,563
Look what I found.

743
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:01,859
<i>And then... it hit me.</i>

744
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,323
<i>There we were...</i>

745
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:06,594
<i>our own little family...</i>

746
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:09,730
<i>living in the moment.</i>

747
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:12,546
<i>It felt like we were startin'
our lives from scratch.</i>

748
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,219
<i>All the bad, forgotten...</i>

749
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:19,875
<i>free from our past...</i>

750
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,435
<i>even for a little while.</i>

751
00:51:23,522 --> 00:51:25,379
<i>It all seemed so perfect...</i>

752
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,866
<i>but so fragile.</i>

753
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:50,562
Boys!

754
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:51,683
Look!

755
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:03,874
My God!

756
00:52:03,905 --> 00:52:06,242
I've never seen such a place.

757
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:09,027
That's quite a drop.

758
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:10,658
Yeah.

759
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,715
Look at that.

760
00:52:11,746 --> 00:52:12,674
Corrina, look at that.

761
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,746
It's beautiful.

762
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:18,211
<i>One summer...</i>

763
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:20,482
<i>I don't remember where...</i>

764
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:26,050
I was really little
and my dad lifted me up.

765
00:52:27,553 --> 00:52:29,410
<i>We went flying.</i>

766
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,218
<i>And then
the water hits you.</i>

767
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,074
<i>It felt like an eternity.</i>

768
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:39,970
<i>You know that feeling when...</i>

769
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:41,538
<i>your heart stops?</i>

770
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:45,539
Freedom.

771
00:52:57,857 --> 00:52:59,490
When I was a kid...

772
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:02,914
<i>my mother left for good.</i>

773
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,171
<i>Where is she now?</i>

774
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,946
She's gone.

775
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:19,009
<i>I just haven't felt anything...</i>

776
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:22,081
<i>since my mother died.</i>

777
00:53:25,378 --> 00:53:26,690
And now?

778
00:53:33,506 --> 00:53:34,946
It's different.

779
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,618
Corrina!

780
00:54:49,313 --> 00:54:50,913
Corrina!

781
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,049
Corrina!

782
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:04,321
Frank, we fucked up, man!

783
00:55:04,353 --> 00:55:05,441
We're gonna get you outta here.

784
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:06,753
You're gonna be okay.

785
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:08,608
We're gonna get you
out of here.

786
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,081
It's my fault.

787
00:55:47,201 --> 00:55:48,545
A truck!

788
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,489
I'm sorry.

789
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,784
<i>Deece...</i>

790
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,175
<i>Deece!</i>

791
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:31,648
Hello.

792
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,696
<i>Deece, it's Pete.</i>

793
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,048
<i>The State's takin' action.</i>

794
00:57:38,975 --> 00:57:41,087
<i>Your boys are headed
to Northridge.</i>

795
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:45,855
<i>Listen, small hospitals
just can't cut it anymore.</i>

796
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,400
When?

797
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:53,824
<i>In the morning.</i>

798
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:56,255
<i>Got word today.</i>

799
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,608
<i>You can still make good.</i>

800
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,280
<i>It's the only way to get back
what's yours.</i>

801
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,719
<i>Deece?</i>

802
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:08,800
<i>Hey!
You listenin'?</i>

803
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:10,784
<i>Deece?</i>

804
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,512
<i>Hey, Deece!</i>

805
00:58:42,176 --> 00:58:43,360
Corrina!

806
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:46,336
Corrina!

807
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,215
Corrina!

808
00:58:53,246 --> 00:58:55,614
No!
Get the fuck off me!

809
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:00,414
Cal!

810
00:59:00,926 --> 00:59:02,303
Cal!

811
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:16,479
No!

812
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,759
No, no, no, no, no, no!

813
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,839
No! No!

814
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:21,503
Please, God!

815
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:22,815
God damn it!

816
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:25,119
No! No!

817
00:59:26,783 --> 00:59:28,798
-Cal!
-No!

818
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,878
Wake up! No!

819
00:59:30,911 --> 00:59:34,015
No! He's bleeding to death!
God damn it!

820
01:00:23,197 --> 01:00:25,566
I tried to have you
in long life.

821
01:01:29,758 --> 01:01:32,605
<i>Your mother died
behind closed doors.</i>

822
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:34,238
<i>No witnesses.</i>

823
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,606
<i>You try to think
of her music,</i>

824
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:39,134
<i>but the screams
creep into your mind...</i>

825
01:01:40,062 --> 01:01:41,342
<i>so you run...</i>

826
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:46,654
<i>but the pain
follows you everywhere.</i>

827
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:47,870
<i>Who are you?</i>

828
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:50,814
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

829
01:01:54,302 --> 01:01:55,678
<i>The lights blind you.</i>

830
01:01:57,149 --> 01:01:59,933
<i>You lose your way,
your voice, muted.</i>

831
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:07,902
Fuck! Fuck!

832
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:13,789
<i>You plead with God...</i>

833
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:16,541
<i>just once to make it right.</i>

834
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,622
You want to hit me,
don't you?

835
01:02:31,805 --> 01:02:33,885
I wanna hit everything.

836
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,613
Fine.

837
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:37,341
Go ahead. Hit me.

838
01:02:37,373 --> 01:02:38,620
Come on.

839
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:39,965
Show me what you got.

840
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:41,692
Come on, fuck me up!

841
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,174
Feels good, doesn't it?

842
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,956
If you use a crutch
too often...

843
01:03:00,988 --> 01:03:02,973
it becomes a prison
of another kind.

844
01:03:22,556 --> 01:03:23,517
When you first came here,

845
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,950
you asked me how it feels
to kill.

846
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:30,748
War has a way
of exposing demons...

847
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,334
deep down inside you that
you'd rather not have exposed.

848
01:03:34,364 --> 01:03:36,284
But I dealt with my demons
head on...

849
01:03:37,245 --> 01:03:38,909
in a room like this one.

850
01:03:40,124 --> 01:03:41,373
They were all kneeling...

851
01:03:42,108 --> 01:03:43,741
in a row.

852
01:03:44,669 --> 01:03:46,813
Their faces will always
be with me.

853
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:48,764
I looked into their eyes...

854
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:51,229
They're still searching.
They're still hoping.

855
01:03:52,284 --> 01:03:54,109
They're still asking why.

856
01:03:54,812 --> 01:03:56,060
Why?

857
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:57,661
Hate...

858
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,924
is horribly destructive.

859
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:04,028
Hate takes over
when reason fades away.

860
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,876
Hate shows itself
in violence and abuse,

861
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:08,285
and the pain
of that violence and abuse

862
01:04:08,316 --> 01:04:09,981
only intensifies the hate

863
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,468
'til all you wanna do
is strike out at something!

864
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:14,813
Everything!

865
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:26,173
I started this place
to be close to my son.

866
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,789
I opened my doors...

867
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:32,540
to help others
who were like Cal.

868
01:04:32,572 --> 01:04:33,980
I thought...

869
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:36,764
this is a good way
to keep him close to me...

870
01:04:38,684 --> 01:04:41,308
so I could protect him
from the outside world.

871
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:44,252
Well now,

872
01:04:44,284 --> 01:04:46,204
I've done all I can do...

873
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:50,365
and I'm tired.

874
01:04:56,603 --> 01:04:58,012
So tired.

875
01:05:10,332 --> 01:05:12,156
We all need help.

876
01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:33,595
Dr. Warren?

877
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:35,005
Everything okay?

878
01:05:36,028 --> 01:05:36,891
Reggie...

879
01:05:37,979 --> 01:05:39,867
I need you to get everyone
out of the house, now.

880
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,083
Deece, what...
What's goin' on?

881
01:05:41,116 --> 01:05:42,685
I said now!

882
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:45,501
Everyone out!

883
01:05:46,939 --> 01:05:48,411
Right away, Dr. Warren.

884
01:06:05,468 --> 01:06:07,739
Give me strength, Father!

885
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:09,596
I don't wanna go like this!

886
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,563
Leo-Leopold, stop.
It's burning.

887
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,675
Everybody out now.
Get Corrina.

888
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:17,659
-Corrina?
-Leopold, get out, man.

889
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:18,620
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

890
01:06:18,651 --> 01:06:19,706
Where's Corrina?

891
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:21,595
Leo, I'll get her.
All right?

892
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:22,939
I need you to get out
right now.

893
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:25,436
All right?
Cassandra! Sandra...

894
01:06:30,747 --> 01:06:31,772
Corrina!

895
01:06:33,915 --> 01:06:35,867
Corrina, open the door!

896
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:49,883
Hi.

897
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:52,732
I thought I killed you.

898
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:56,220
Who'd kill me?

899
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:45,563
Dr. Warren!

900
01:07:48,187 --> 01:07:49,499
Reggie...

901
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,676
thanks for your service.

902
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:54,811
It's a pleasure, sir.

903
01:08:10,939 --> 01:08:12,411
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

904
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:13,530
-What?
-I'll be right back.

905
01:08:13,563 --> 01:08:14,459
Hey!

906
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:17,882
Corrina, get down.
Get down.

907
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:20,698
Stay there.

908
01:08:25,946 --> 01:08:27,130
Okay.

909
01:08:28,763 --> 01:08:30,619
Yeah, let's go.

910
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:31,771
Come on.

911
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:12,474
<i>"We all need help,"
Deece said to me...</i>

912
01:09:12,506 --> 01:09:14,331
<i>and I knew he was right.</i>

913
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:20,890
<i>Milton Way went up in flames</i>

914
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,650
<i>and was never again.</i>

915
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:24,697
<i>After his son's death,</i>

916
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:26,714
<i>there wasn't much there
for him.</i>

917
01:09:32,825 --> 01:09:35,065
<i>Maybe we were Deece's family.</i>

918
01:09:35,098 --> 01:09:36,603
<i>We just didn't realize it.</i>

919
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,978
<i>And that's how
our journey began...</i>

920
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,769
<i>to the untamed land.</i>

921
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:18,650
<i>We escaped...</i>

922
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,697
<i>but that's not
what made us free.</i>

923
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,513
<i>I feel something
for the first time</i>

924
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:24,890
<i>in a long while.</i>

925
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:29,209
<i>I got this warm feelin'
in my heart...</i>

926
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:32,666
<i>the kind of feeling you get
after a crazy dream...</i>

927
01:10:32,697 --> 01:10:33,881
<i>with a happy ending.</i>

928
01:10:35,513 --> 01:10:37,466
<i>I don't wanna
let this feeling go.</i>

929
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,601
<i>When I was ready
to give up...</i>

930
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:43,418
<i>life wouldn't let me.</i>

931
01:10:45,112 --> 01:10:47,417
<i>Guess it figured
I wasn't done just yet.</i>

932
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:50,841
<i>Destiny came knockin'...</i>

933
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:51,450
<i>loud.</i>

934
01:10:58,808 --> 01:11:00,729
<i>And it all happened
right here...</i>

935
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:04,634
<i>on this very rock
that we breathe on.</i>

936
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,121
<i>Mama would be proud.</i>

937
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,352
<i>I'll never forget Deece,</i>

938
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:13,401
<i>Cal and the whole lot of them.</i>

939
01:11:14,872 --> 01:11:17,375
<i>They will be the song
when I need to remember.</i>
