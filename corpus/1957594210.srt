00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:04,797
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,613
(light classical music)

3
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,694
- Jimmy.

4
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:40,542
Come here.

5
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,040
Gunshot victim.

6
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,330
Asian male, unidentified.

7
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,532
- [Jimmy] No ID on him?

8
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,040
- We've had a couple of
different sets of IDs.

9
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,063
You'll need gloves.

10
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,680
When I swabbed his mouth, I saw this.

11
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,116
- I need a closer look.

12
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,323
Blue?

13
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,563
- That's right.

14
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,265
- [Jimmy] Blue hairs.

15
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:29,575
(siren blaring in distance)

16
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,580
- [Gerri] I'll go see where they are.

17
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,413
- Relax.

18
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:34,483
- No, I'll go check.

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
- Peter sent our deposition.

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,970
He wants to know if you need him.

21
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,803
- Why?

22
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:40,750
We're just signing papers.

23
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
Tell Peter all we need
are the papers, okay?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,100
- I've got the papers.

25
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,113
I apologize, it's nuts today.

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,270
Do you need a pen?

27
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,363
- We'll read first.

28
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,370
- Will Jim be here today?

29
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
- Jim?

30
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:55,740
- The other party in the divorce?

31
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:58,290
You want him here, we'll get him here.

32
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,820
- Mr. Burton's already
signed but I can check-

33
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,330
- Oh no, no.

34
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,910
It's all right.

35
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,923
He's already signed.

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,270
I would like it though
if someone would tell him

37
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,390
that I think this agreement is fair.

38
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,180
I hope he does too.

39
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,770
And that I wish him the best.

40
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,295
- I'll tell him.

41
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:21,720
- Thanks.

42
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,553
- So?

43
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,223
Sign.

44
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,560
- Thank you for all your help.

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,420
- Sure thing.

46
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,786
Mrs. Croft?

47
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,383
- Tell Peter we'll talk.

48
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,700
Wanna share a cab?

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,533
- [Christine] Sure.

50
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,100
- Actually, Mr. Broadbent
was hoping to meet you.

51
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
- Daniel Dawes Broadbent?

52
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,933
- Yeah.

53
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,210
- Gerri, thanks for all your help.

54
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,860
- No, no, let's go see Broadbent.

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,310
- Really, no, you go on.

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,880
I promise you I won't sign anything.

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,830
- Okay, sweetheart.

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,283
You take care,

59
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,116
hmm?
- I will.

60
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,699
(bell dinging)

61
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,560
- Ah, can you get these
fellas to get it for me

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
about two o'clock seven.

63
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,573
- [Dan] Oh, good, come in.

64
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,750
- Christine Cagney.

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,817
- Dan Broadbent.

66
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:29,940
- Hello.
- Hi.

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,030
Let's be comfortable.

68
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,975
- [Christine] Thank you.

69
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,500
- You have to get back to
DA's office right away?

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,480
Can you stay a bit?

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,780
- [Christine] I have time.

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,040
- Ah, my biggest failure, 1956.

73
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,680
We got wind that Horace
Stoneham was making a deal

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,583
to take the Giants to San Francisco.

75
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,360
So a bunch of us decided to build Stoneham

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,763
a new stadium to replace the polo grounds.

77
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,790
We even made him an offer on the club.

78
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,943
(chuckling) It still kills me.

79
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,350
I mean you hear endlessly about Brooklyn

80
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,343
and the Dodgers.

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,623
We lost Willie Mays.

82
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,720
- Mr. Broadbent.

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,820
- Dan.

84
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,260
- Dan.

85
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,510
You're breaking my heart.

86
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,083
- You know that old story doesn't,

87
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,979
(laughing) doesn't work
quite as well as it used to.

88
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,651
(all laughing)

89
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,430
- Well I say screw nostalgia.

90
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,660
It's just eyes straight ahead, Dan.

91
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,603
It's the only way.

92
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,483
What?

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,910
- What the hell are you doing

94
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,410
assigned to our little
pig-eyed District Attorney?

95
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,190
- Well I know that you're
the mayor's best friend

96
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,740
but the DA's a very good man.

97
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,090
- He's a pill.

98
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,330
He can't possibly think
he can be elected mayor.

99
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,140
- How do you know that's
what he's thinking?

100
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,000
- [Dan] Are you gonna support him?

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,490
- Right, like I have to really worry about

102
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,800
which way to throw my influence.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,191
- Don't underestimate your influence

104
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,173
or your friends.

105
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:03,860
You know you're up for a nomination

106
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,670
to the Law Enforcement Oversight Board?

107
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,953
- The LEO?
- Mhmm.

108
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,994
- I've heard it's a pretty long list.

109
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,000
- Well if it was such a long list

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,130
I wouldn't have asked
to get a look at you.

111
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,370
You want the appointment?

112
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,720
- Yes, very much.

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,540
- [Dan] Then don't be coy about it.

114
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,940
- No problem.

115
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,380
Who's my competition?

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
- Not for me to say.

117
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,670
The best advice I can offer you

118
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,500
is don't be faint-hearted when it comes

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,900
to acting in your own self-interest.

120
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,770
The LEO Board makes policy.

121
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,630
That's not a bad way to introduce yourself

122
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,603
to public life.

123
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:35,662
Well.

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,553
Nice to see you.

125
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
- Same here.

126
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,613
Thank you.

127
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,077
Was I too in his face?

128
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,500
I mean he sort of asked for it, but,

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,350
- You were great.

130
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,980
- Oh, we're never gonna
get a cab at this hour.

131
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,280
- We've got a car for you.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,250
- Hello.
- Good morning.

133
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,087
- Well.

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,961
We'll have to do this again sometime.

135
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,294
- I'd like that.

136
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,210
(light music)

137
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,798
It was nice meeting you.

138
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:24,670
- Bye.

139
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,503
- [Tom] Bye.

140
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,433
(light music)

141
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:44,885
- Oh.

142
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,103
How was it?

143
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,253
- It's done.

144
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,340
- Did you get to talk with Jim?

145
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,400
- [Christine] He wasn't there.

146
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,340
- Oh.

147
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,780
- It's all right.

148
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,210
I would have preferred more of a closure,

149
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,260
you know, face to face, but

150
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,620
he didn't, so.

151
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,453
- So.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,090
You got all dressed up for a room

153
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,455
full of lawyers. (laughing)

154
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:12,433
- (chuckling) Yeah.

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,753
Well.

156
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,913
Mary Beth, I'm up for the LEO Board.

157
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,530
I mean I'm way high up on the list.

158
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,940
- When did you hear that?

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,830
- I met with Daniel Broadbent.

160
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,020
- I know that name.

161
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,810
- Course you know that name.

162
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,698
He's the one-

163
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:32,531
(phone ringing)

164
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:33,510
- That's Douglas Trayne.

165
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,920
He's been asking about you all afternoon.

166
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,700
I promised I'd buzz as
soon as you got back.

167
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,159
Lacey.

168
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,033
Yes.

169
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,390
Yes, well I know she's on her way so I...

170
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,623
Oh, oh here she comes right now.

171
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,383
Right away.

172
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,083
Right.

173
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:54,380
- It's the end of the
day, what does he want?

174
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,960
- [Mary Beth] Come on.

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,723
- I'd gotta get coffee.

176
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,968
(sighing)

177
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:07,301
I hate looking this good for these guys.

178
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,040
- [Douglas] Come in, Mrs. Lacey.

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,873
- We're here.

180
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:12,120
Lieutenant Cagney's right behind me.

181
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,030
- I wanna be very clear on something.

182
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,700
You're an investigator
for the District Attorney.

183
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,170
You serve at his pleasure.

184
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,770
Your loyalties, wherever
your emotions may take you

185
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,590
belong right here, right?

186
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,440
- I understand, sir.

187
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,500
- You're not a cop, no bleeding
blue on this assignment.

188
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
- I understand, sir.

189
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,350
- What's up?

190
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,950
- I'm supposed to be loyal
to the District Attorney.

191
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,480
- She knows that.

192
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,140
Why would you think
she wouldn't know that?

193
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,550
- I don't want anybody to
misunderstand anything.

194
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,537
- Anyhow, the police and the DA

195
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,023
are on the same side.

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,793
Aren't they?

197
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,340
- Two nights ago, a volunteer

198
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,220
from the Christ is Savior soup kitchen

199
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,530
discovered the body of a
young male in the dumpster

200
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,210
between the church and a
building at 2141 South Vandemeer

201
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,970
in the 27th precinct.

202
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,803
The victim was carrying

203
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:00,360
two different sets of identification.

204
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,840
He could be a resident alien,

205
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
a naturalized citizen,

206
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,280
or an illegal with forged docs.

207
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,580
He is ethnic Chinese.

208
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,200
Died of a single gunshot
wound at point blank range.

209
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,460
Now, the coroner found this stuff

210
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,570
caught in his front teeth.

211
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,270
I want you to take a look at that.

212
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,492
- They're little hairs, like fuzz.

213
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,270
- And blue.

214
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,103
- Exactly.

215
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,470
The lab thinks these
are fibers from fake fur

216
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,550
found on the collar of
a patrolman's jacket.

217
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,050
- So what are you saying?

218
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,530
If the victim was struggling
with a police officer,

219
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,620
he might have used his teeth?

220
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,340
- And some of the hairs stuck there?

221
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,890
- [Douglas] That is the theory.

222
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,850
- What's the caliber of the slug?

223
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,090
- Nine millimeter.

224
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,360
- [Christine] Any officer
involved shootings

225
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,490
reported that night?

226
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,523
- None reported.

227
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,320
Now listen, Homicide is
cooperating with Internal Affairs,

228
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,770
and the District Attorney's
gonna be involved

229
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,963
in this investigation.

230
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,310
It could be one bad cop.

231
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,210
- It could be no bad cop.

232
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,000
It could be a civilian in a police jacket.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,310
- Yeah, or it could be something worse.

234
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,820
Last time there was a PD
scandal, we weren't ready.

235
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,530
And the former District
Attorney got creamed.

236
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,390
Now whatever kind of bombshell this is,

237
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,570
that will not happen this time.

238
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,540
Our District Attorney
has a very bright future

239
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,220
of service to the city
of New York ahead of him.

240
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,640
And it's my job to see to it

241
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,790
that it stays that way.

242
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,960
- So?

243
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,793
- So nothing.

244
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,193
So.

245
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:31,364
- What don't you like?

246
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,280
- Our Mr. Trayne has already
decided what this is.

247
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,490
- No he hasn't.

248
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,673
- I take it back.

249
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,330
- Don't start with me, Mary Beth.

250
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,453
It's been a long day.

251
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,453
- I know.

252
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,930
(beeping)

253
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,160
- [Harvey] Hi, hon.

254
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,420
It's 5:15.

255
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,045
Alice called from her piano lesson

256
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,080
which must have got started late.

257
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,840
She'll be done at six.

258
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,160
If you can pick her up, don't call me.

259
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,793
- [Tom] Hi, it's Tom Cornell.

260
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,320
You want to meet me and a
couple of friends for dinner?

261
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,470
How's that for forward?

262
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,373
Oh, I just thought, what the hell, right?

263
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:14,923
You can always ignore the call.

264
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:17,925
(light music)

265
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:18,780
- Who was that?

266
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,990
- A lawyer, I just met him.

267
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,290
- Today, divorce day?

268
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,493
- I was not flirting, I swear to God.

269
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,743
- He sounds young.

270
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,433
- Well.

271
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:33,490
(phone beeping)

272
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,250
- [Tom] We're meeting at
Mucho Gusto's at eight.

273
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,800
55th and third.

274
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,050
I hope to see you there, buh-bye.

275
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,763
- Mucho Gusto's, he is young.

276
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,210
- What do you think?

277
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,930
- Go.

278
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,380
It can't be good, be careful.

279
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,010
- Night.

280
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,070
(phone beeping)

281
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,130
- [Harvey] Listen, one way or the other,

282
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,410
you better call me, I'll just worry.

283
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,390
Oh, Alice says there's a weird message

284
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,223
on the phone at home.

285
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,477
You should probably check it out, bye.

286
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,686
(phone beeping)

287
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,960
(phone ringing)

288
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,410
- [Woman On Phone] Yeah,
I'm calling May Beth Lacey

289
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,120
on behalf of her father Martin.

290
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,680
If you get this message,

291
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,090
meet me at Winny's this
evening in Yonkers.

292
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,690
I'm sorry, but I don't have a phone

293
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,370
and I must talk to you this night.

294
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,890
It's about your father.

295
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,170
I hope to be making your acquaintance.

296
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,003
Thank you.

297
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,931
(bus revving)

298
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:09,528
(chill music)

299
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,363
- May Beth?

300
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,723
- [Mary Beth] Close enough.

301
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:30,800
- God, I'd just about given you up.

302
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
- [Mary Beth] What is this about?

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
- Sit down a minute, sweetheart.

304
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,580
You want something to warm you up?

305
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,774
- [Mary Beth] No thanks.

306
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:39,607
- Aw.

307
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,589
- [Mary Beth] Can I buy you a drink?

308
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,590
- Thank you, darling.

309
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,766
I'll have one more please, huh?

310
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:46,855
- [Bartender] Coming right up, sweetheart.

311
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:50,522
- (sighing) It's just cold.

312
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,033
Well.

313
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,300
Your father and I, we've
been living together

314
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,870
for sometime now.

315
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,370
I hope that doesn't shock you.

316
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,623
- No, not if you're both happy.

317
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,457
- Well, he's a dear, dear man.

318
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,387
You know this.

319
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:09,887
- [Mary Beth] Hmm.

320
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,550
- It's never a bed of roses.

321
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,027
I know you two have had your problems.

322
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:23,670
I've had trouble with my loved ones too

323
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,310
but I'm happy to say we've
let bygones be bygones and

324
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,913
my sister has very kindly
offered me an extension.

325
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,913
She's extended me the offer
of her apartment in Arizona.

326
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,663
'Cause these winters, you know,

327
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,890
they take five years off your life.

328
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,603
Last winter nearly did me in.

329
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,030
My sister doesn't want to
have any part of Martin

330
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,600
which is understandable, so,

331
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,240
I thought, you being his daughter-

332
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,140
- Where is Martin?

333
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,930
- He's sitting back over there.

334
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:10,382
(tense music)

335
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:17,038
- Martin?

336
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,323
He doesn't recognize me.

337
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,123
Ma'am?

338
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:43,693
Lady?

339
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:46,608
(fire whooshing)

340
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,720
- [Waitress] Scotch and soda for the lady?

341
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,260
- No, mine's the club soda.

342
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,093
- So I finally got a chance

343
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:53,220
to ask him about the car.

344
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,017
So I said "Commissioner,
how can you justify

345
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,880
"taking a limo to get to work?"

346
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,257
He starts flapping his
arms and he's screaming,

347
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:01,397
"It's a sedan!

348
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,330
"And it's not a perk, it's security."

349
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,810
- [Christine] Who wants to kill him?

350
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,800
- [Tom] Nobody.

351
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,847
- Well that's what I say to him, I said

352
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,907
"Nobody wants to kill you, Commissioner.

353
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,570
"You're not important enough to kill."

354
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,270
- Actually I hear he's
got a restraining order

355
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,103
on his wife,

356
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:14,630
she's come after him.
- Oh, ex-wife.

357
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,780
- Wife.

358
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,630
She's on Paximum but
she won't quit drinking

359
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,920
so she hallucinates.

360
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,850
- [Paul] You're kidding.

361
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,810
- [Pam] And he's scared to death of her

362
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,850
but all the money's from her side, so.

363
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,160
- [Christine] So that's
why none of this stuff

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,670
gets into the paper.

365
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,700
- You know, I am so sick up to here

366
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,321
of having to apologize
for working for a tabloid.

367
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,040
And number one, we never get to print,

368
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,873
- Any of the good stuff.

369
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,476
- The really good stuff, right.

370
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,844
And the people I talk to, this
is what they want to hear.

371
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,268
- Don't worry, the
mayors race will heat up,

372
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,580
you'll both have plenty to print.

373
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
- [Pam] Oh man, dull and duller.

374
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,660
- [Tom] So which way do
you think your paper's

375
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,493
gonna jump, Pam?

376
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:47,240
They gonna endorse my guy,
pick a winner for a change?

377
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,369
- I hear they like the DA.

378
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,820
- [Christine] Well, not such you'd notice,

379
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,970
I did a little press
liaison stuff last year

380
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,540
and your metro editor cut us no slack.

381
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,780
- [Paul] Well, don't take it personally.

382
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,200
- [Christine] I don't take it personally.

383
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,050
Do you take it personally?

384
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,210
- You just think the mayor's dull

385
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,590
because he's got the
city running so smoothly.

386
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,221
- [Pam] Tom, the man's a cipher.

387
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:08,180
- (laughing) Well, you're all too young

388
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,373
but I remember the last
mayor who had real charisma.

389
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,153
What?

390
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,680
John Lindsay, what?

391
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,511
- [Tom] I couldn't think
of anyone but La Guardia.

392
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,984
- La Guardia?

393
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:23,993
- [Tom] I know.

394
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,961
- La Guardia was during the depression!

395
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:30,658
God, Tom, just because I remember Gimbles

396
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:34,360
does not mean I voted
for Fiorello La Guardia.

397
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,826
- My father worked for Lindsay.

398
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,160
- [Christine] Oh, well thank you, Paul.

399
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,036
- In high school.

400
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,250
(everyone laughing)

401
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,520
- Isn't that swell.

402
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,920
People, I'm sure you all remember

403
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,789
my favorite governor, Peter Stuyvesant.

404
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,286
(Pam laughing)

405
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:51,203
(melancholy music)

406
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:31,962
(clock ticking)

407
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:49,348
- Morning.

408
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:50,181
- Morning.

409
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,793
- What's wrong?

410
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,120
- Can you get Alice to school?

411
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,073
I think he's sick.

412
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,000
- Mary Beth, he's just old.

413
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,833
It's a shock to you.

414
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,390
- I'm gonna take him into emergency.

415
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,892
His breathing's not right.

416
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:06,725
- Okay.

417
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:12,827
Go.
(buzzer buzzing)

418
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,851
(sighing)

419
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:24,493
(people chattering)

420
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,300
- Doctor?

421
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,890
I hope I was right to
bring Mr. Zibiski in.

422
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,010
- You're Mr. Zibniski's,

423
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,387
- Daughter yeah, what can you tell me?

424
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,020
- I have a few questions.

425
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,700
What medications is he taking?

426
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,020
- [Mary Beth] I don't know.

427
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,133
- [Doctor] All right, is he
allergic to any medications?

428
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,210
- [Mary Beth] He didn't
have anything on him.

429
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,020
- Well I'm gonna need a
word with his physician.

430
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,853
Who does he see?

431
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,010
- [Mary Beth] I don't know.

432
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,992
- [Doctor] Does he have a physician?

433
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:58,168
- I can't tell you that.

434
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:59,001
- I see.

435
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:02,470
Mr. Zibiski's residence is here in Queens.

436
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,950
- Ah, no, that's my address.

437
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,050
He spent the night.

438
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,923
Is he all right?

439
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,570
- He has pneumonia.

440
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,290
And a rather severe
infection in his left ear.

441
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,120
Does he suffer from dementia?

442
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,953
- Dementia?

443
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,923
- [Doctor] Is he disoriented?

444
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,030
- He didn't know me and my husband,

445
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,350
but if he's got a high fever,

446
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,428
couldn't that account for it?

447
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:26,428
- We'll have to see.

448
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,510
What do you know about the bruises?

449
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,790
- Bruises?

450
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,260
- [Doctor] On his arms and torso.

451
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,160
- I don't know anything about bruises.

452
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,833
Look, Doctor.

453
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,703
We're estranged, for years and years.

454
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,170
I only saw him again last night.

455
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:52,333
- I understand.

456
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,890
I see it must have been
a shock, I can imagine.

457
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,093
- It was a real shock.

458
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,250
- Your husband as well?

459
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,793
- We both were, sure.

460
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,760
I'll try to find out his
medical history, Doctor, but-

461
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,950
- Thank you.

462
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,200
I'd like to get back to last night.

463
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,860
Did you and your husband
have words about your father?

464
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,060
- A fight, no.

465
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,900
- [Doctor] I'm just trying to
explain the bruises, ma'am.

466
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,630
- Well, he's pretty unsteady.

467
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,840
Maybe he fell down.

468
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,673
- [Doctor] Do you consider your father

469
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,770
an intrusion in your life?

470
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,420
- I didn't hit my father, Doctor,

471
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,800
neither did my husband.

472
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,633
- [Doctor] That tone was uncalled for.

473
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,350
- I'm sorry, but I don't
know how he's been living.

474
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,522
Maybe the woman he was
with knocked him around!

475
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,355
- [Doctor] Will you
lower your voice please?

476
00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:33,800
- Hey, I'm a retired police officer.

477
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,320
I know the questions that get asked

478
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,040
when there's suspected domestic abuse.

479
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,670
I don't hit, never ever!

480
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,507
Last 12 hours is the first time

481
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:42,030
I've seen him in seven years,

482
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,070
that's three times since
I'm eight years old.

483
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,770
- Is everything all right, Doctor?

484
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,560
- I'm not gonna do anything.

485
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,150
I'm sorry for the way things look.

486
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,593
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

487
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,550
- [Doctor] Mrs. ?

488
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,243
- Lacey.

489
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,733
- [Doctor] Mrs. Lacey has
agreed to keep her cool.

490
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,703
I think we'll be all right.

491
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:25,218
(bystanders chattering)

492
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:33,460
(siren blaring in distance)

493
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,977
- Yeah, I've heard it all my life

494
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,241
and I don't have to hear it from you!

495
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,074
- You don't ever listen!
- Look, I'm offering you

496
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:37,907
the chance to talk.
- And you don't ever listen

497
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:38,740
or shut up!
- I'm not gonna hear it

498
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,573
from you at all!
- Don't touch.

499
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,017
- I'm gonna shut him up!
- Okay, don't touch me!

500
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:42,764
Look please, just go right this way.

501
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,058
You're gonna complicate things.

502
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:44,891
- [Man] You don't ever shut up.

503
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,679
- [Cop] You're gonna
complicate this, shut up.

504
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,087
- Morning, Sergeant.

505
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:50,260
I'm supposed to see Captain Cardenas.

506
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,410
- I'm Captain Cardenas.

507
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,300
- How do you do?

508
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,130
Mary Beth Lacey, District
Attorney's office.

509
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,110
- Yes.

510
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,690
Why are you here?

511
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,523
- Oh, well.

512
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,760
This is part of an
attempt by the DA's office

513
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,130
to increase communication.

514
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,090
- [Cardenas] Why did
the DA's office pick us?

515
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,923
- [Mary Beth] Well.

516
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,310
- I'd like to know what we've done

517
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,650
to merit any kind of attention from the DA

518
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,240
so we can be sure of doing it again.

519
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,590
- Have there been problems?

520
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,350
- Are you an attorney, Miss Lacey?

521
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,743
- Me?

522
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,820
I'm a retired police officer.

523
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,950
Put in quite a few years at the one four.

524
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,920
- Oh, so you know Burt Samuels?

525
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,753
- He's a good man.

526
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,250
- [Cardenas] Yeah, you see him?

527
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,620
- No, he's in Florida.

528
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,263
- Oh, well.

529
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,640
Let me give you the picture here.

530
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,130
Over 60 percent of our
population is resident alien.

531
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,000
We have problems with language,

532
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,350
with witnesses who are
afraid of deportation,

533
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,240
problems that come with thousands of men

534
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,130
separated from their families

535
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,000
living too close to each other

536
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,580
and raised not to call on the police

537
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,850
when they get into trouble.

538
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,683
- I see.

539
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,480
- So when someone comes
here from the DA's office

540
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,053
my expectations are low.

541
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,240
But they got off on the
right foot with you.

542
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,640
You let me know if you need anything.

543
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,060
- Thank you, Captain.

544
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,460
- I'm telling you, this
is a big assignment.

545
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:18,041
What?

546
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:18,874
What?

547
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:21,841
- I don't like spying on police officers.

548
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,320
- You're not spying.

549
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,410
This is undercover work.

550
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,733
You love going undercover.

551
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,070
- Well, I like putting on the wigs

552
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,170
and making up stories,

553
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,513
but this is going into a,

554
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:37,380
going into a precinct as me

555
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,163
and lying about why I'm there.

556
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,900
- [Christine] Like it?

557
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,450
- What do I need an office for?

558
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,213
- For me.

559
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,550
Well, you know how you're always saying

560
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,870
that the sky should be the limit

561
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,200
for me and police work?

562
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,033
- True.

563
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:02,700
In terms of talent, I
never met anyone better.

564
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,190
- Yet I have done everything to run away

565
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,707
from the potential, have I not?

566
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:08,040
I mean I'm always acting
like I have all the time

567
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,930
in the world for everything while I don't.

568
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,230
So I am putting the message out

569
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,410
that I am serious.

570
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,463
Politics and all.

571
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:18,010
And every stick of furniture
and every new phone line

572
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,083
is a vote of confidence.

573
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,630
- Okay.

574
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,463
- Good.

575
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:25,617
I prepped a sheet here of the officers

576
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,030
that I want you to get in contact with.

577
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,510
I'll be getting the personnel files later

578
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,810
but you can start on that.

579
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,910
Are you all right?

580
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:38,623
- My father's back in my life.

581
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,437
- [Christine] Oh, Mary Beth, that's great.

582
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,853
- How is that great?

583
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,933
- Are you speaking to him?

584
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,130
- Yeah, we're speaking.

585
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,223
- This is good!

586
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,680
Obviously you have
mixed emotions about it.

587
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,993
But I think it's good.

588
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,930
I'd give anything to spend
another day with my Pop.

589
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,520
- That's two different
things, Christine, completely.

590
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,800
- It is not, he's your father.

591
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,343
It's good you're seeing him.

592
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,133
How is he?

593
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,103
- He's good.

594
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:21,871
- Good.

595
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,710
- I'm not his keeper, Angela.

596
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,880
I don't know why your
boyfriend hasn't called.

597
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,220
- [Angela] The watch commander
says Jacques is sick.

598
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,657
I wanna know how he's feeling is all.

599
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,787
Forget it, all right?

600
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,390
- I'd be happy to.

601
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,840
Hey if Jacques wants to
call you, he'll call you.

602
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,160
- [Angela] This is a restricted area.

603
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,993
- Oh yeah.

604
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:49,539
I got the CO's permission.

605
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,320
Officer Lum?

606
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,670
- That's right.

607
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,710
- [Mary Beth] Mary Beth Lacey,
District Attorney's office.

608
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,890
- Ah, nice to meet you.

609
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,840
- I'm offering a workshop this week

610
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,250
on DA-PD relations and I was wondering

611
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,170
if you would be my co-conspirator.

612
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,600
I don't know a soul here

613
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,320
and I got your name off of this report

614
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,143
that was filed a couple days ago.

615
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,070
The seventh.

616
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,240
And it is a very good example
of a well-written report.

617
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,580
I was wondering if I could
use it in my workshop.

618
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,155
- What report is that?

619
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,530
- It's the young Chinese homicide victim.

620
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,180
You found him in the what, the lot?

621
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,610
- Dumpster.

622
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,940
Pretty routine report, no witnesses,

623
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,500
mean we just secure the area for Homicide.

624
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,760
- You recognize the victim?

625
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,930
- No.

626
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,976
Oh, he was dressed like a fob though,

627
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,070
fresh off-

628
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,930
- [Mary Beth] The boat, yeah.

629
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,380
- But I think he'd been here a while

630
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,810
and he was making money.

631
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,860
- Why?

632
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,380
- Well you see guys entering this country

633
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,040
are thousands of dollars
in debt for their passage.

634
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,440
You know, they spend a dime on stuff

635
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,546
like haircuts, they cut each other's hair.

636
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:51,610
But you see this guy's hair was styled.

637
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,010
And you can see that he had one of those

638
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,712
kind of eyebrows that,

639
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,090
you know, kind of go right across.

640
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,030
It was plucked right here.

641
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,023
- And why didn't any of
that make the report?

642
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,020
- 'Cause it's speculating.

643
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,870
I thought we were supposed
to keep the reports

644
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,250
by the book.

645
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,530
- [Mary Beth] Right you are.

646
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,040
I knew I was right to look you up.

647
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,400
So, wanna introduce me around?

648
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,500
- Sure thing, come on.

649
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:16,364
(light music)

650
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:17,477
- [Christine] That's Lum, L-U-M?

651
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:18,390
- [Mary Beth] Yeah.

652
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,450
- [Christine] Angela.

653
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,903
- [Mary Beth] She was at the scene.

654
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,973
- Yeah, pulled her jacket.

655
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,040
- I'll come in in the morning,
go over the files with you.

656
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,370
- [Christine] I'll be here another hour,

657
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,933
why don't you come in, we'll do it now.

658
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,223
- I can't, sorry.

659
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:39,043
(phone ringing)

660
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:43,970
- Who you looking for?

661
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,180
- I wanted to know how Mr. Zibiski is.

662
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,200
- [Nurse] 522, that way.

663
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,970
Just stick your head in.

664
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,900
- I don't wanna disturb him.

665
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,020
I just wanna know how he is.

666
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,340
- Beverly's the RN.

667
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,173
She's with him now.

668
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,006
Just go ahead in.

669
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,860
- I'll wait.

670
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,163
- [Nurse] It's really okay.

671
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,613
- I'll wait.

672
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,620
- [Announcer] Dr. Lancaster, 451.

673
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:10,399
(melancholy music)

674
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:14,130
- 11 and a half minutes, okay, all done.

675
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,053
Watch out baby, here I come.

676
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:19,269
(humming)

677
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:22,080
(laughing)

678
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,787
Oh my god, there's enough
there for an army, eh?

679
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,280
Hey!

680
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,697
How's that for timing, eh?

681
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,940
- He's responding to the antibiotics.

682
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,810
They're still giving him oxygen.

683
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,230
- [Harvey] Tube up his nose?

684
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,541
- I guess.

685
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,283
And they drained the ear.

686
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:40,810
- Ew!

687
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,080
- Don't ew, you used to get
ear infections all the time.

688
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,930
Take that inside.

689
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,220
- Was he out of it?

690
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,883
- I didn't ask.

691
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,118
- Well, didn't you see him?

692
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,233
- It wasn't a good time.

693
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,533
(cars honking)

694
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,770
Where's the skirt I ironed for you?

695
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,090
- Daddy said I should wear pants

696
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,483
if I'm gonna play kickball.

697
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:14,873
- Daddy's right, I forgot.

698
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,710
- [Alice] Mom?

699
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,543
- What?

700
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,203
- [Alice] How many grandpappies do I have?

701
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,413
- One.

702
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,050
Where'd you hear that word?

703
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,440
- I told Britney that
Martin was at our house.

704
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,610
And she said she had three grandpappies,

705
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,010
'cause from her two daddies.

706
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,663
- You have one.

707
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,460
- [Alice] Does Martin love me?

708
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,153
- He never had the
pleasure of knowing you.

709
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,440
Don't you think knowing a person

710
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,570
has something to do with loving them?

711
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,593
- I love him.

712
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,953
- Why?

713
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,123
- Because.

714
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,193
See?

715
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
- That's for Martin?

716
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,063
Very nice.

717
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,663
Love, love, love.

718
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
You know what love is, Alice?

719
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,970
Love is your daddy remembering

720
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,290
that you have kickball today,
you have to wear pants.

721
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,800
But you don't think about that, do you

722
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,140
because your daddy is always there.

723
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,257
See, where's the cards and
the stickers for daddy?

724
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:31,357
When's the last time you made one for him?

725
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,563
- Saturday.

726
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:46,041
- [Harvey] Morning.

727
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,503
- Harvey, why didn't you show me this?

728
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,043
Very nice.

729
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,969
- Yes sir, just take them
right through that door.

730
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:00,719
- [Man] Thanks a lot.

731
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:04,955
(knocking)

732
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:06,230
- [Christine] Come on in.

733
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,990
- [Douglas] So I gave him my tie.

734
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,560
Can you imagine wearing a black tie

735
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,523
on the day you're gonna
announce for mayor?

736
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:12,356
(Christine and Douglas laughing)

737
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:13,189
- [Mary Beth] I'm sorry to interrupt.

738
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:14,676
- No, no, Mary Beth, come on in.

739
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,580
- [Douglas] No, I'm going.

740
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,660
- What's up?

741
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,400
- [Christine] I was coming in
to look at the personnel files

742
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,280
on the two-seven.

743
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,330
- I got them right here.
- Oh, right.

744
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,700
- [Douglas] I'll need
these back before one.

745
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,990
- Okay, thanks.

746
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,913
- A black tie. (laughing)

747
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,930
- Mary Beth, these are pure gold.

748
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,763
Sit down.

749
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,853
Gigi Cardenas is a lesbian.

750
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,750
Her girlfriend runs a travel agency

751
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,380
and she got in big trouble

752
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,240
because someone accused her

753
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,917
of sending police business her way.

754
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,400
I mean she was cleared, but, (laughing)

755
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,150
- You think that's any of our concern?

756
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,170
- Course not.

757
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,640
That's why it's so much fun to know!

758
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
- [Mary Beth] This is
everybody's nightmare.

759
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,010
You know that, don't you?

760
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,160
- I'm sure she's a very worthwhile person.

761
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,250
- People snooping around
in confidential files

762
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,100
like they were Jackie Collins novels.

763
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,075
Gushing and giggling over
private secret stuff.

764
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:11,690
IRS secretaries, FBI clerks.

765
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,190
People in doctor's offices,

766
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,480
how would you like people snickering

767
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,064
over your medical history?

768
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:17,300
- Would you lighten up?

769
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,823
It's just dishing.

770
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:21,750
(sighing)

771
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,810
I went over the names you gave me.

772
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,160
I pulled the people
with the worst records.

773
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,770
Got a 15 year veteran
who's been suspended twice.

774
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,373
He likes to use his baton.

775
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:34,490
The officer who just
transferred to the 27th

776
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,620
who does moonlighting in a
topless bar on the island.

777
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,640
- So?

778
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,270
- Well the bar is owned
by a Chinese landlord

779
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,810
who's done time for pandering.

780
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,300
- Oh.

781
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,551
- They have a fair amount
of drugs and alcohol rehabs

782
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,730
including Angela Lum, by the way.

783
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,350
- Does that make the 27th any different

784
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,620
than any other precinct?

785
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,340
- Well, until we get a lead elsewhere,

786
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,670
that matches up with somebody else's

787
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,310
personal his-
(phone ringing)

788
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,143
Cagney.

789
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,043
Oh, hi.

790
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,090
Actually this isn't a good time, but,

791
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,040
yeah, let me call you back.

792
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,410
Five minutes.

793
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,403
Okay, bye.

794
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,330
- You run across somebody named Jacques?

795
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,490
- Jack?

796
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,760
- No, like in French.

797
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,470
J-A-C-Q-U-E-S.

798
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,980
- No , I would remember Jacques, why?

799
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900
- I heard the name yesterday,

800
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,290
it stuck in my brain.

801
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,410
I'll try and get the full name.

802
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,243
- Great, thanks.

803
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,553
Oh, hey.

804
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,650
Watch the news tonight,
our guy's announcing.

805
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,857
- Zero tolerance.

806
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,900
Zero tolerance of punks,

807
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,593
zero tolerance of corruption,

808
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,883
zero tolerance for business as usual.

809
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,667
(crowd applauding)

810
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:55,793
Thank you.

811
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:56,840
Thank you very much, thank you.

812
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,380
- That's a good color on you, Chris.

813
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,840
- Oh, thank you, that's what I thought.

814
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,200
- Zero tolerance for charisma.

815
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,980
- He is a good man, Tom.

816
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,270
- Well he's got the Elmer Fudd vote,

817
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,824
I gotta hand it to him.

818
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,333
- What do you think of
the zero tolerance thing?

819
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,844
- Eh.

820
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:12,677
- [Christine] He paid big bucks for it.

821
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:15,240
- Listen, it worked in
a bunch of other races.

822
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,530
- Zero tolerance?

823
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,844
The exact words?

824
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:19,580
- [Pam] Mhmm.

825
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,890
- God, with all the money
they paid for a consultant

826
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,570
you'd think he'd come up with something

827
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,403
a little more unique.

828
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:24,620
- These guys don't want unique.

829
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,580
They love the fact that
he plays in Peoria.

830
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,560
- Anybody ever hear of
a DA who had to keep

831
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,340
reminding people he was tough?

832
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,710
This guy's doing it.

833
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,840
- You wish.

834
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,163
- He's running a classic female campaign.

835
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,608
- I beg your pardon.

836
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:39,810
- Classic, it's Christine
Whitman's campaign.

837
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,620
- Huh, he should only do so well.

838
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,170
- He should only look so tough.

839
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,720
- I've learned the trick to getting Pam

840
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,840
to spill the really good dirt.

841
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,900
You gotta catch her between
drinks two and three, mhmm.

842
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,050
- You don't drink, huh?

843
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,890
- Not today.

844
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,240
- Not the last time either.

845
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,853
- Right.

846
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,010
- And all I do is take you
to these margarita palaces.

847
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,640
- Oh, that's all right.

848
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,150
I've been on the wagon for seven years.

849
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,349
I fell off a bit this summer,

850
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:13,820
but hey I had a good time

851
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,523
but apparently nobody else did.

852
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:22,439
(Tom whistling)

853
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,433
This was fun.

854
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,753
I had a great time.

855
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:32,910
Oh, god.

856
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,460
I had a great time.

857
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,720
I'm sorry, I'm out of practice.

858
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,970
- I had a great time too.

859
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,290
- Are we finished talking?

860
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,883
- Not nearly.

861
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,933
- Would you like to
continue this at my place?

862
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,163
- I can't.

863
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,903
Good night.

864
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:00,757
- Night.

865
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,403
- Zibiski, right?

866
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,410
- Right.

867
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,243
- He's gone.

868
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,950
Someone was supposed to call you.

869
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,810
They put him on the other side

870
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,620
when he stabilized.

871
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,090
- What?

872
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,040
- [Nurse] He's stable, so they
put him in a different room.

873
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,440
- He's all right?

874
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,683
- Yeah, he's doing good.

875
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,140
Yeah, where's Mr. Zibiski at?

876
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,340
I'll get you the number.

877
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:51,403
Mhmm, 503, thanks.

878
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,563
503, that-a-way.

879
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:59,479
(melancholy music)

880
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:12,483
- Pardon me.

881
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:15,305
Mr. Zibiski in 503,

882
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,540
he could use a shave.

883
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,143
- I'll make a note for the morning.

884
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,320
- Thank you very much.

885
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,589
Night.

886
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,422
- You have a good one.

887
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:42,743
(car honking)

888
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:56,370
- So?

889
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,700
- Well, they would have
been a whole lot easier

890
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,120
if Angela had said the man's name was Giac

891
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,700
instead of Jacques.

892
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,584
- Leonard P. Di Giacomo.

893
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:07,510
- Giac, right?

894
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,439
- Oh wow, was in the two-seven, huh?

895
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:10,272
- When I searched,

896
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:13,310
he had enunciated more
clearly and said Giac.

897
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,510
- No, that was my fault.

898
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,630
- You're suspicious of her, huh?

899
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,880
- I don't like that she
called in sick today.

900
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:23,369
(buzzing)

901
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,970
- Think she's gonna disappear?

902
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,690
- I don't like coincidences, that's all.

903
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,523
- [Angela] Yes?

904
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,500
- Angela, hey, it's Mary Beth Lacey,

905
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,333
can I come up?

906
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,213
Angela?

907
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,460
(door buzzing)

908
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,683
- Good decision, Angela.

909
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,173
- Hi.

910
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,443
- [Angela] Hi, come on.

911
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,000
- This is Lieutenant Chris Cagney.

912
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,833
- Officer Lum.

913
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,193
- Come in.

914
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,530
- Oh, this is nice.

915
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,200
- Yeah, the kitchen's huge and

916
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,110
bedroom gets a lot of light.

917
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,460
- What do you pay, if
you don't mind my asking?

918
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,083
- 875.

919
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,253
- In this location, that is nice.

920
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,160
- So am I gonna lose it?

921
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,760
- What?

922
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,763
- My Manhattan fantasy place.

923
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,920
This is the best apartment I've ever had.

924
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,960
- What makes you think
you're gonna lose it?

925
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
- She's from Internal Affairs, isn't she?

926
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,368
- No.

927
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,430
No, we're both with the DA.

928
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,133
- But you're looking into that
homicide case, aren't you?

929
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:48,732
(sighing) I knew it.

930
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,283
I don't have anything to say.

931
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,333
- Chris, could you read this for me?

932
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,310
We've worked together so long,

933
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,785
she reads my writing better than I do.

934
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:04,535
Can I have a glass of water please?

935
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,353
- Sure.

936
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,443
- Is that a G or a six?

937
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,323
- It's a six.

938
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,703
- Thank you.

939
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,143
Thanks.

940
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:26,883
You wanna take a minute
and think this over?

941
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,233
It's a pretty big deal, not cooperating.

942
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,062
- This was at the scene.

943
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,544
- [Christine] What is that?

944
00:44:08,544 --> 00:44:09,593
- Key tag.

945
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,160
- Virginia is for lovers.

946
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,690
- [Angela] It was on the
ground near the dumpster.

947
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,263
- Why would you steal evidence?

948
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,893
- I wouldn't, never.

949
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,553
These are mine.

950
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:48,320
- It's the same tag.

951
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,880
- I just assumed that it was mine.

952
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,660
I tucked it into my blouse
pocket, kept working.

953
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,753
I didn't even register what I was doing.

954
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:59,290
And when I got home and used my keys,

955
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,330
I saw I hadn't lost my tag.

956
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,453
- So you turn it in.

957
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,380
Angela, what's the problem?

958
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,980
- I thought I knew whose it was.

959
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,480
I mean they must have made
a million of these but,

960
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,130
I wanted to check.

961
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,233
- Leonard Di Giacomo?

962
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,013
Is it his?

963
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,333
- I think so.

964
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,903
I can't get Giac to call me.

965
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:42,232
(knocking)

966
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:47,232
(birds chirping)
(dog barking in distance)

967
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:52,330
(kids chattering in distance)

968
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,747
- [Mary Beth] Mr. Di Giacomo?

969
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,618
(knocking)

970
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,047
- [Woman] Who is it?

971
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,133
- Christine Cagney.

972
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,183
Hi.

973
00:46:40,183 --> 00:46:41,200
- Do I know you?

974
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,033
- [Christine] No, ma'am.

975
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,640
I'm looking for one of your neighbors.

976
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,210
Have you seen Giac lately?

977
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,040
- Across the street?

978
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,820
- [Christine] Yes, Ma'am.

979
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,560
- This is ridiculous.

980
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,610
Come inside.

981
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,443
- Oh, thank you.

982
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:56,660
Thank you.

983
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,540
None of us have seen Giac for over a week.

984
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
Does he always leave his porch light on?

985
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,720
- [Mary Beth] Nobody on
this side of the street

986
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,700
has seen him in days

987
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,210
and it's impossible to see in the house.

988
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,647
- Let me tell you a story about Giac

989
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:11,060
and you tell me if it matters.

990
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,110
He barely squeaks through the Academy.

991
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,320
His career is marginal,

992
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,790
he has problems with every
Sergeant that he works with,

993
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,330
but he takes the detective exam

994
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,160
and he scores through the roof.

995
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,270
Now they throw out the results

996
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,250
but they let him take the test again.

997
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,083
- And?

998
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,423
- He decides not to take it.

999
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,610
- You think he sounds like a cheat.

1000
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,560
- [Christine] Yeah.

1001
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,393
- So do I.

1002
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,116
- Okay, I wonder if I should stay-

1003
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:37,949
(knocking)

1004
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:39,200
God!

1005
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,033
What?

1006
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:45,080
- The boat is gone, I
thought I'd tell you.

1007
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,930
- What boat?

1008
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,160
- Your friend, kept the big ugly boat

1009
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,773
all winter in the drive.

1010
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,043
- [Mary Beth] Thank you.

1011
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,260
- [Christine] Really.

1012
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,664
- The heck was that?

1013
00:47:58,664 --> 00:48:00,426
(knocking)

1014
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:01,259
- Giac?

1015
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,703
After you.

1016
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,410
- Don't worry about it Mary Beth,

1017
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,570
it's practically a desk job.

1018
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,370
- Practically is the operative word.

1019
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,090
- Oh, gee.

1020
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,003
- [Christine] Careful.

1021
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,450
- What they got beds down there?

1022
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,213
- Below.

1023
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,213
They call it below.

1024
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,501
Giac?

1025
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:45,800
(knocking)

1026
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,713
- Easy.

1027
00:48:53,573 --> 00:48:56,073
(light music)

1028
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:06,156
Well, in a guess,

1029
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,886
I'd say it's a party boat.

1030
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,123
- You hear that?

1031
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,413
- Yeah, it's the boat
knocking on the pier.

1032
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,200
- It's not on the pier side.

1033
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,040
- Well it's probably, you know,

1034
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,811
a lobster pot or what do you call it?

1035
00:49:32,811 --> 00:49:33,965
(tense music)

1036
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,359
A crab trap.

1037
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,526
- Thank you, Captain Nemo.

1038
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:39,777
- Funny, Chris.

1039
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:48,355
(ominous music)

1040
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:00,899
(radio chatter)

1041
00:50:00,899 --> 00:50:03,066
(zipping)

1042
00:50:07,937 --> 00:50:11,687
- [Detective] Did you
see Di Giacomo's hands?

1043
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,770
- What, he was wrapped in a tarp.

1044
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,283
- Somebody cut off his hands.

1045
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,520
- They cut off his hands?

1046
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,353
- Yeah.

1047
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,740
I gotta go.

1048
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,737
There's the CO.

1049
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,610
- That's Captain Cardenas.

1050
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,440
- Let's go.

1051
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,753
- No, she's made me.

1052
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:42,390
- Detective Tsu, what have you got here?

1053
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,223
- Swell.

1054
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,360
- Busted by Captain Cardenas.

1055
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,320
She looks like the type
that'll hold a grudge.

1056
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,470
- Not funny, Christine.

1057
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,040
- You cut off hands if someone's
stealing from you, right?

1058
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,180
- Right.

1059
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,263
So what was Giac stealing?

1060
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:04,990
Chris, I don't like not seeing your face

1061
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,330
when we talk.

1062
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,770
And do we have to have separate offices?

1063
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,830
I feel ridiculous in that room!

1064
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,460
- You feel ridiculous 'cause
you were spying on your own

1065
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,357
and you got caught.

1066
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:15,440
Am I right?

1067
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,273
- Possibly.

1068
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:20,190
- [Announcer] Mr. Sharp
to admitting office.

1069
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,013
Mr. Sharp to admitting office.

1070
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:35,350
(Martin gasping)

1071
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,183
- What's wrong?

1072
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,618
- [Mary Beth] I'm sorry,
I thought you were asleep.

1073
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:40,693
- Is that wrong?

1074
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,483
- No, no.

1075
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:46,334
How you feeling?

1076
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,810
- I feel good, how are you feeling?

1077
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,210
- Beat.

1078
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,590
- Oh.

1079
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:52,423
You look good.

1080
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,613
- [Mary Beth] Thanks.

1081
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,410
- Can I ask you something?

1082
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,423
- [Mary Beth] Sure.

1083
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,683
- What kind of place is this?

1084
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:04,506
- It's a hospital.

1085
00:52:04,506 --> 00:52:05,339
- I see.

1086
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,993
Am I sick?

1087
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,223
- [Mary Beth] You got one or two things.

1088
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,317
- I'll be damned.

1089
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,480
- Don't you feel sick?

1090
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,830
- [Martin] No, I feel good.

1091
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,400
- Okay.

1092
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,100
- I just don't like

1093
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,580
not knowing where the hell I am.

1094
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,023
- [Mary Beth] You, the happy wanderer?

1095
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:29,085
- Me?

1096
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,933
- You can't stand the old familiar places.

1097
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,090
- That's the other guy.

1098
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:39,273
- Who, what other guy?

1099
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,633
- The guy with the hat.

1100
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,500
- [Nurse] How you doing, Martin?

1101
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,950
- [Martin] I'm good.

1102
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,260
- Oh, you've got your daughter here.

1103
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,110
Maybe your daughter will
help you finish your dinner.

1104
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,620
Does that sound like a plan?

1105
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,233
- Oh, sure.

1106
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:02,003
(chuckling) Yeah.

1107
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,500
- Well, let's see what you got here.

1108
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,164
(Martin chuckling)

1109
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:09,830
What?

1110
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:10,663
What's so funny?

1111
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,823
- She thinks you're my
daughter. (laughing)

1112
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:19,958
- She's a riot.

1113
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:20,810
- [Martin] Yeah she is.

1114
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,370
Oh my goodness.

1115
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,013
- Cream corn, rice and,

1116
00:53:25,908 --> 00:53:27,876
your guess is as good as mine.

1117
00:53:27,876 --> 00:53:29,331
What do you want?

1118
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,748
- I'd rather guess than know.

1119
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,810
- The last thing to go is the charm.

1120
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:35,880
You should have seen him.

1121
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,380
- Now listen, if you
didn't know who you were,

1122
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,360
you'd rely on the basics too.

1123
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,500
Be nice, talk nice,

1124
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,440
don't argue, and all the
strangers won't hurt you.

1125
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,273
- So?

1126
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,470
- What are you gonna do when he's better?

1127
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,068
- [Mary Beth] Wait, slow down.

1128
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:53,116
- Well, you gotta think about it, I mean,

1129
00:53:53,116 --> 00:53:55,560
when the hospital decides he's okay,

1130
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,890
he's gonna be out on
the sidewalk like that.

1131
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,620
- Nobody's putting him on the street.

1132
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,370
- No, they'll put him in
the first convalescent home

1133
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,750
with an open bed.

1134
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,180
- Then fine.

1135
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,063
That'll be fine.

1136
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:13,020
(sighing)

1137
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,060
(cars honking)

1138
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,524
- [Christine] Thanks,
just give me the five

1139
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:17,443
and keep the change.

1140
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:22,120
- [Tom] Hi.

1141
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,953
- Hi.

1142
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,340
- Pam and Paul bailed.

1143
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,000
Pam's gotta work late.

1144
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,370
- Yeah, I talked to her this afternoon.

1145
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,400
She said she had a
deadline she had to meet.

1146
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,300
- So I thought we'd take a break

1147
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,860
from the same old, same old.

1148
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,810
Is this place okay?

1149
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,343
- Actually, I don't eat a lot of steak.

1150
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,673
- Then what are we doing here?

1151
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,633
- No problem?

1152
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:44,466
- No.

1153
00:54:44,466 --> 00:54:46,710
Candid was never a problem with me.

1154
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,894
- You like people who
just get it out, huh?

1155
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:49,727
- Yeah, don't you?

1156
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:50,560
- Absolutely.

1157
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,873
So Tom, what's going on here?

1158
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,083
- What?

1159
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,180
- Well we seem to get
along at every department.

1160
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,487
But one, is this the sun also rises?

1161
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:06,693
So tell me about the war, Tom.

1162
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,164
- You know, there's a Jamaican Jerk place

1163
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,730
just a sec, between first and second.

1164
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,990
You like Jerk?

1165
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,000
- I like Jerk very much.

1166
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,743
Big jerk who wiggles off subject.

1167
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:20,603
What's going on?

1168
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:23,805
- We can't sleep together, Chris?

1169
00:55:23,805 --> 00:55:25,040
(Christine laughing)

1170
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,280
- God.
- Okay, I'm starting

1171
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,530
from there.

1172
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,910
But knowing that, I just decided

1173
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:30,050
it would be counter-productive

1174
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,683
to do the ancillary sex things.

1175
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,910
I just thought it'd be easier to stop

1176
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,963
if we never got started, don't you think?

1177
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,770
- Why can't we sleep together?

1178
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,480
- It's too embarrassing.

1179
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:49,663
- Are you gay?

1180
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,800
- You think that's embarrassing?

1181
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,190
- Not at all, are you?

1182
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,450
- No.

1183
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,450
- I didn't think so.

1184
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,950
- Listen, I'm sure I'm not
the only person in the world

1185
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,233
who's made mistakes in the area of sex.

1186
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,650
- You're not the only
person in this couple

1187
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,033
who's made those mistakes.

1188
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,253
You wanna swap embarrassing stories?

1189
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,203
- Well maybe if you weren't looking at me.

1190
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,643
- Okay.

1191
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,723
Oh, the stuff I could tell you.

1192
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,940
The coyote mornings

1193
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,370
where you'd rather chew off your arm

1194
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,020
than wake the person next to you.

1195
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,310
The recurring search for
where you left your car

1196
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,920
the night before.

1197
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,753
- Okay.

1198
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:36,368
I went down to St. Bart's last month.

1199
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,133
And I came back with this thing.

1200
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,533
- Oh.

1201
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,630
A treatable thing?

1202
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,255
- Oh, completely.

1203
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:50,430
And I'm in the midst of treatment.

1204
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,633
I'll be as good as new.

1205
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,993
You better have some good tales, lady.

1206
00:56:59,897 --> 00:57:02,314
- [Christine] Where to begin?

1207
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:06,886
(lightly somber music)

1208
00:57:32,096 --> 00:57:34,429
- It's all right, Mary Beth.

1209
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:37,070
- What is that supposed to mean?

1210
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,610
- What you're feeling about Martin.

1211
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,850
- Thank you, go to bed.

1212
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,160
- Come in yourself, let me hold you.

1213
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,410
- Harv, if I wanted to be held,

1214
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,553
I wouldn't be ironing naked tablecloth.

1215
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,030
- Mary Beth, he's not gonna
be your father for you ever.

1216
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,700
The kids never had him as a grandfather,

1217
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,790
they never will.

1218
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:55,923
Your head knows that.

1219
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,190
- You told me to make up with him.

1220
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,440
Over the years, and you
were probably right, Harv.

1221
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,400
- Forget about it, babe.

1222
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,585
- No, Harvey, let me,
- Whoah.

1223
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:10,585
- Let me alone.

1224
00:58:23,262 --> 00:58:25,579
- [Woman] Hey, you can't park here!

1225
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:26,454
- [Man] Hey!

1226
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:27,911
(car honking)

1227
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:28,950
- [Woman] Child, get in here, please!

1228
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,367
- [Man] That's on you, Larry.

1229
00:58:40,423 --> 00:58:42,310
- [Harvey] Good morning.

1230
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,230
- My alarm didn't go off,

1231
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:44,600
she's gonna be late for school.

1232
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,400
- [Harvey] I took her, let you sleep in.

1233
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,180
- [Mary Beth] I appreciate it.

1234
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,200
- [Harvey] Body you found made the paper.

1235
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,498
- [Mary Beth] Yeah?

1236
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:52,953
- [Harvey] Yeah, look at this.

1237
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,240
- [Mary Beth] To protect and sever?

1238
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,957
- I don't think it's funny.

1239
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:00,960
I mean no matter how
rotten an egg the guy was

1240
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,793
he was a cop.

1241
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:05,460
They got no business with this headline.

1242
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,613
Oh, listen to this.

1243
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,410
In a city already bleeding from
a reputation for corruption,

1244
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,904
the brutal slaying of
officer Leonard Di Gia,

1245
00:59:14,904 --> 00:59:16,443
- Di Giacomo.

1246
00:59:16,443 --> 00:59:19,330
- Di Giacomo, discovered handless

1247
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,190
and frozen yesterday,

1248
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,903
may be the unkindest cut of all.

1249
00:59:23,903 --> 00:59:24,736
- [Mary Beth] Ugh.

1250
00:59:24,736 --> 00:59:26,190
- An investigation by the Globe

1251
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,550
reveals that Di Giacomo may be linked

1252
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:32,330
to the death of an unidentified
man early this week.

1253
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:36,540
Di Giacomo was assigned to
the notorious 27th Precinct.

1254
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,370
- [Mary Beth] Notorious, since when?

1255
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,260
- Which according to records obtained

1256
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,580
exclusively by the Globe,

1257
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,200
appears to be the
Department's dumping ground

1258
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,387
for misfits of every stripe.

1259
00:59:48,387 --> 00:59:49,550
- What?

1260
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,760
- Run by a homosexual commanding officer,

1261
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,960
who herself has faced
accusations of misconduct.

1262
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,960
- Wait a second, go back, Harvey.

1263
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,710
Did that say, according to records?

1264
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,310
- [Harvey] Which according to records

1265
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:06,130
obtained exclusively by the Globe.

1266
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,130
- Douglas Trayne.

1267
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,680
- Oh, he's quoted in the story.

1268
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,550
No, no he's not.

1269
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,520
Listen, an Assistant District Attorney

1270
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,263
who asked to remain unidentified.

1271
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,740
- Yeah.

1272
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:22,810
They ran everything.

1273
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,380
The unproven allegations,
the times in rehab,

1274
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,420
everything all lumped together,

1275
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,700
everything sounding connected,

1276
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,360
and it's got nothing to do
with these murders, nothing.

1277
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,893
- When has the press
ever gotten it straight?

1278
01:00:31,893 --> 01:00:33,370
They decide what the story is

1279
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,930
then they morph the facts to fit it.

1280
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,270
To us it's two unsolved murders,

1281
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,050
to them it's the rotten precinct story.

1282
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,020
Just be glad that it's
not another one of those

1283
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,550
what's not working in the city

1284
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,713
or where was the DA story.

1285
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:48,948
(elevator dinging)

1286
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:49,781
Hold it!

1287
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:51,800
Excuse me.

1288
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,537
- I know who leaked,

1289
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:54,923
who leaked those files.

1290
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,663
- You do not.

1291
01:00:59,020 --> 01:00:59,853
- I do, Chris.

1292
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,740
He's the ADA who's quoted in the story.

1293
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,810
He's campaigning for his boss

1294
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,360
and he has access to the files.

1295
01:01:10,322 --> 01:01:11,779
Douglas Trayne.

1296
01:01:11,779 --> 01:01:13,196
Douglas Trayne.

1297
01:01:13,196 --> 01:01:16,610
(elevator dinging)

1298
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,761
I hated that we let him
see those. (sighing)

1299
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,763
He's a lawyer, for God's sake.

1300
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,740
Those were confidential records.

1301
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,560
I am gonna tell him what I think of him.

1302
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,003
- Conference, Mary Beth.

1303
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,260
Don't do it.

1304
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,380
He's gonna deny it

1305
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,610
and he's gonna resent
you for accusing him.

1306
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:52,980
- Too bad.

1307
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,540
Douglas Trayne won't be my best friend.

1308
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,600
I could live with his resentment.

1309
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,560
- Well, then think about me.

1310
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,931
You're gonna go blast him,

1311
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,603
I'm the one who's gonna take the heat.

1312
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,910
Look, we serve at his pleasure.

1313
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:03,743
It's okay for you,

1314
01:02:03,743 --> 01:02:06,410
you know, Harvey's back in a good job.

1315
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,740
You can kiss this off.

1316
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,840
I'm serious about seeing how far I can go.

1317
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,300
I'm through ditzing around with my career,

1318
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,580
and politics is part of what I do now.

1319
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,413
- Yeah.

1320
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,840
- And as politics goes,

1321
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,940
this isn't that big a deal.

1322
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,710
- Your political friends are responsible

1323
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,310
for broadbrushing an entire precinct

1324
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,640
full of police officers!

1325
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,170
It is the very biggest sort of a deal!

1326
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:30,282
- Hey, I didn't cut off
the guy's hands, back off!

1327
01:02:30,282 --> 01:02:33,115
(toilet flushing)

1328
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:56,060
Look, the best thing we can do now

1329
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,930
is find out why Di Giacomo was killed.

1330
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:58,943
Do you wanna work?

1331
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,510
- Of course I wanna work.

1332
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,360
- Fine.

1333
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,760
Now if we went back over
the evidence support

1334
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,777
from Giac's house.

1335
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:06,290
They found a bank book

1336
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,530
and a Jersey driver's
license for a Robert Dory.

1337
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:11,034
- I don't get it.

1338
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:11,867
- Well the first victim

1339
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:14,380
was found with two
different sets of ID on him.

1340
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,263
A green card and a
Jersey driver's license.

1341
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,120
Didn't you say that the
27th was full of immigrants?

1342
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,353
- Forged documents?

1343
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:23,186
- Yeah.

1344
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,920
So I'm gonna run it by Bunko.

1345
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,960
I may even call INS.

1346
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,760
And you want me to go
back to the precinct?

1347
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,993
- [Mary Beth] I better be.

1348
01:03:33,535 --> 01:03:36,120
- Hey, your father's in the hospital?

1349
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:36,953
- Yeah.

1350
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,860
- I called your apartment, Harvey told me.

1351
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,430
- [Mary Beth] Yeah.

1352
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,263
- Well you didn't mention,

1353
01:03:43,263 --> 01:03:44,817
is he gonna be okay?!

1354
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,673
- He'll be fine.

1355
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,310
- I have a message for
the District Attorney.

1356
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:57,923
Two can play at this game.

1357
01:03:57,923 --> 01:03:59,150
(door slamming)

1358
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,630
- Yes, Captain.

1359
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,200
I don't know that the District Attorney

1360
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,650
is responsible for that article.

1361
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,110
- I don't care what you know.

1362
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,090
This precinct is off limits to you.

1363
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,560
Now my offices have been instructed

1364
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,960
to cooperate with Homicide
and with Internal Affairs.

1365
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,110
Until I am satisfied that the DA

1366
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,650
is going to stop playing politics

1367
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,840
with the lives of my people,

1368
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,810
his representatives here are not welcome

1369
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,020
in this precinct!

1370
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,200
Get it?

1371
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,033
- Yes.

1372
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,490
The release of those
documents is an outrage.

1373
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,710
- I've asked for an investigation.

1374
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,010
I don't need your outrage.

1375
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:31,843
- Yes, ma'am.

1376
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:43,798
(patrons chattering)

1377
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,703
Angela.

1378
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,553
I'm so sorry.

1379
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,400
- Don't be sorry for me.

1380
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,590
I was an idiot about Giac.

1381
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,740
I ruined my life over the guy,

1382
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,823
him and his scams.

1383
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,153
- [Mary Beth] Can I sit down?

1384
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,043
- Yeah.

1385
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,143
- Scams, you say?

1386
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,560
Look it, Angela.

1387
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,683
Did Giac ever offer to get you a fake ID?

1388
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,990
- How'd you know about that?

1389
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,040
- [Mary Beth] He did.

1390
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,183
- A driver's license.

1391
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,820
He knew how petrified
I was about the test.

1392
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,223
Everybody here knows.

1393
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,390
Last time I had to take it

1394
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,083
three times before I passed.

1395
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,740
He just said, forget
about it, he'd get me one.

1396
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,320
- [Mary Beth] From Jersey?

1397
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,153
- Yeah.

1398
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:46,677
Listen, can I tell you about something,

1399
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:48,180
this has always stuck in my brain.

1400
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,013
- Sure.

1401
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:53,127
- I mean when we rode
together only once one night,

1402
01:05:53,127 --> 01:05:55,490
and I remember this guy
coming up to him in the car,

1403
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:58,020
started trotting up, we were at a light.

1404
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,610
And Giac reached up to turn on the,

1405
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:03,250
what do you call it, the dome light on.

1406
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,200
And then he just switched it right off.

1407
01:06:06,117 --> 01:06:08,301
The guy just spun around and ran off.

1408
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:09,860
It's so strange, I remember.

1409
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:10,880
- I don't get it.

1410
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,610
- See he came up like a friend.

1411
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,443
But with the light on,

1412
01:06:13,443 --> 01:06:16,349
you can see that Giac
wasn't alone in the car.

1413
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:17,930
Giac must have wanted to warn him off,

1414
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,380
that's what I think.

1415
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,220
- Did you recognize this guy?

1416
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,930
- No, it was the first
time I ever saw him.

1417
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,890
But when they brought him
in a couple months later

1418
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:26,743
I recognized him.

1419
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,370
- [Mary Beth] Felix J. Marcola,

1420
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:31,410
he's doing a nickel in Fort Snow.

1421
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,400
- [Christine] For what?

1422
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,550
- Armed robbery.

1423
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,820
Hijacked a truck delivering
office equipment.

1424
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,230
Took 20,000 dollars worth of
four color toner cartridges.

1425
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:40,200
- What's that?

1426
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,780
- The toner for copy machines.

1427
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,434
Big laser copiers.

1428
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,300
The cartridges were for machines

1429
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,830
that were so new, they
barely got on the market.

1430
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,300
Marcola leaves a truck full of computers,

1431
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,250
only takes the cartridges.

1432
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,350
You're right about there being forgers,

1433
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,250
I know you were.

1434
01:06:58,517 --> 01:07:00,350
You going out tonight?

1435
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,810
- No, I didn't hear from him today.

1436
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,095
- Oh.

1437
01:07:05,095 --> 01:07:06,553
- It's all right, I just didn't hear.

1438
01:07:06,553 --> 01:07:08,563
He's a busy guy, I'm a busy girl.

1439
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,430
- Are you on a even keel?

1440
01:07:14,357 --> 01:07:15,670
- What's that supposed to mean?

1441
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,653
About Tom?

1442
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,290
- [Mary Beth] About Tom, about Jim.

1443
01:07:24,677 --> 01:07:25,820
(somber music)

1444
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,653
- I'm okay.

1445
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:31,477
I did some drinking this summer.

1446
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,023
- I know.

1447
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,503
- What do you mean you know?

1448
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:38,336
How could you know?

1449
01:07:38,336 --> 01:07:40,843
I only drank at night.

1450
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,770
- I knew when you were drinking

1451
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,070
and now I know you're not.

1452
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,125
(light music)

1453
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:55,044
(phone ringing)

1454
01:07:55,044 --> 01:07:55,961
- You knew.

1455
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,093
Cagney.

1456
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:01,530
Yes, sir.

1457
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,850
Yes, sir, we've got some information.

1458
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:04,883
Could you hold on just one moment please?

1459
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:07,047
Okay Mary Beth, this is it.

1460
01:08:07,047 --> 01:08:10,680
Now we broke this case, your
little old brains and mine.

1461
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,210
Yeah we'll send this stiff up the channels

1462
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,260
and see what happens.

1463
01:08:16,317 --> 01:08:18,817
(cab zooming)

1464
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,810
- ADA Trayne, meet Bob
Cortez, Associate Director of-

1465
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,290
- It's managing Director.

1466
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,110
- [Ben] Ah, congratulations,
Managing Director,

1467
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,650
Atlantic State's Metro North Division.

1468
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:29,710
- So what's the matter, Ben,

1469
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:32,420
you didn't think we had
enough agencies working this?

1470
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,250
- Our old friend Terry Lou Casey from INS.

1471
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,260
- Sure, we've spoken.

1472
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,440
- Special Agent Randall Mark,

1473
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,710
New York State Task
Force on Organized Crime.

1474
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:39,543
- Randall.

1475
01:08:39,543 --> 01:08:41,750
- And you know Detective Shu,

1476
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,008
I get it right?

1477
01:08:43,008 --> 01:08:43,925
- It's Tsu.

1478
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:46,760
- NYPD Homicide.

1479
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,713
And Captain Gigi Cardenas of the 27th.

1480
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,560
And that's everyone.

1481
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,660
If we take our seats,

1482
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:55,960
we can begin the briefing.

1483
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,290
Now I've asked these locals to join us

1484
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:01,420
because their investigations have impacted

1485
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,690
on our project codenamed Bogus.

1486
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,690
The locals came in time for all the fun.

1487
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,930
Bogus is the single largest source

1488
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,890
of counterfeit documentation
operating in the country.

1489
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,480
They prey on immigrant populations

1490
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,854
who are in the country illegally,

1491
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:18,790
and they have proven
themselves to be ruthless

1492
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:21,010
in their response to less organized

1493
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:23,170
Mom and Pop forgers.

1494
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,550
The death and dismemberment
of Leonard Di Giacomo

1495
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,373
is further proof of their viciousness.

1496
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
It's due to the work of
a unit in the DA's office

1497
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,807
that the connection with Bogus was made.

1498
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:34,893
- Pardon me, sir.

1499
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,313
- Yeah?

1500
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,840
- Mary Beth Lacey with
the District Attorney.

1501
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,480
I just want to clear up the record.

1502
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,610
The connection was made
due to a great lead

1503
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,420
provided by a patrol officer

1504
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:51,103
in the 27th Precinct of the
New York Police Department.

1505
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,800
That's for the record.

1506
01:09:58,590 --> 01:09:59,490
- [Ben] All right.

1507
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,960
Let's go over the plans
for tomorrow's action.

1508
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,260
At 0800 hours tomorrow, Eastern time,

1509
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,111
agents will gather in seven locations.

1510
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:12,611
(light music)

1511
01:10:20,374 --> 01:10:21,710
- What, you don't want one?

1512
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,936
- It's yours, coffee with.

1513
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:24,476
- Thanks.

1514
01:10:24,476 --> 01:10:25,780
- Lacey.

1515
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,090
- Yes, ma'am?

1516
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,670
Captain Cardenas, this is
Lieutenant Christine Cagney.

1517
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:30,503
- Captain.

1518
01:10:30,503 --> 01:10:31,720
- [Christine] Lieutenant.

1519
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,060
- Well, good luck today.

1520
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:33,893
- Excuse me.

1521
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,120
- This is some setup, huh?

1522
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:43,743
- Look.

1523
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,160
This isn't exactly an apology.

1524
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,203
- No, Captain.

1525
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,670
You don't have anything to apologize for.

1526
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,143
- No, you should know.

1527
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,740
Right before we had words,

1528
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,120
I heard that I'd fallen out of contention

1529
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,610
for an appointment I had high hopes for.

1530
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,023
- Ah, oh.

1531
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,560
- Well the Law Enforcement Oversight Board

1532
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,493
isn't exactly the Supreme Court, but,

1533
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:11,861
I guess I took it pretty hard, so.

1534
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,523
I guess this is an apology, sorry.

1535
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,093
- No.

1536
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:23,204
The LEO Board, that's
what you're talking about?

1537
01:11:23,204 --> 01:11:24,371
- Yeah, right.

1538
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,623
Oh, don't worry, Lacey,
it's only a career.

1539
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,663
- Mary Beth!

1540
01:11:35,153 --> 01:11:36,780
Move, we're rolling, let's go.

1541
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,130
- You be careful out there.

1542
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,853
- Yes ma'am.

1543
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:41,686
- Come on!

1544
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,265
What?

1545
01:11:58,938 --> 01:11:59,771
What?

1546
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:05,150
Whatever, we'll talk about it later?

1547
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,313
- You got that right.

1548
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,847
(tense music)

1549
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:03,684
(crashing)

1550
01:13:03,684 --> 01:13:04,517
- Police!

1551
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:05,684
- Hands up, come on!

1552
01:13:05,684 --> 01:13:06,607
Do it!

1553
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:07,440
Get down!

1554
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,899
- All right, all right,
all right, all right!

1555
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:11,277
- You, you, right there, right there!

1556
01:13:11,277 --> 01:13:12,600
Put your hands in the air.

1557
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,499
Get your hands up in the air, up up up!

1558
01:13:14,499 --> 01:13:15,499
- Face down!

1559
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:18,440
- [Mary Beth] Don't act
stupid, you won't get hurt.

1560
01:13:22,808 --> 01:13:23,808
- I got him!

1561
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,336
(suspenseful music)

1562
01:13:34,653 --> 01:13:37,153
(tense music)

1563
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:05,668
(sirens blaring in distance)

1564
01:14:11,065 --> 01:14:14,232
(helicopter whirring)

1565
01:14:20,864 --> 01:14:23,200
Show me your hands.

1566
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,033
Your hands!

1567
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,023
I need to see your hands, both of them!

1568
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,752
Get them up!

1569
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:32,416
Both of them up!

1570
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,249
Up!

1571
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,911
(suspenseful music)

1572
01:14:51,447 --> 01:14:52,280
Agh!

1573
01:14:56,269 --> 01:14:59,437
- Freeze, you son of a bitch!

1574
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:02,980
Don't move!

1575
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,880
Don't you breathe.

1576
01:15:08,455 --> 01:15:09,333
Leave it go.

1577
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,493
You motherless piece of filth!

1578
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:17,662
Chris, you cut?

1579
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:21,628
- A little.

1580
01:15:22,659 --> 01:15:23,492
I'm okay.

1581
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,190
- Talk to me, Chris.

1582
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,203
- I'm okay!

1583
01:15:31,032 --> 01:15:34,199
(helicopter whirring)

1584
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:50,113
- They give you something for pain?

1585
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:51,890
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1586
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,843
Mary Beth, would you talk to me?

1587
01:15:56,477 --> 01:15:57,683
- Nah, it'll keep.

1588
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,023
- No, now!

1589
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,870
- You leaked those files, Christine.

1590
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,587
Don't tell me, there's
gonna be an investigation

1591
01:16:08,587 --> 01:16:10,953
and I won't lie for you, so don't tell me.

1592
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:14,900
- First of all, there isn't
gonna be any investigation.

1593
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,733
- You did it!

1594
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,650
You let me think it was Doug Trayne.

1595
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,900
You shipped me off to Siberia,

1596
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,020
that was part of it too.

1597
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,130
You let a whole precinct
full of police officers

1598
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:26,980
get their reputations torched

1599
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,470
and you humiliated one of
the only handful of women

1600
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,360
in this city to work
her way up to Captain!

1601
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,710
- I did not make up her file.

1602
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:35,190
She sleeps with girls,

1603
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,880
look if her private
life is so humiliating,

1604
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,600
- She's not ashamed and you know it.

1605
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,703
She's realistic!

1606
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,363
- It wasn't personal.

1607
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:48,360
Come on, do I care who
mows her lawn, come on!

1608
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,610
You know me.

1609
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,120
- I don't know you.

1610
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,910
- No, what you don't know

1611
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:55,067
is what you got to do to get ahead now.

1612
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,460
- That's right.

1613
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,210
I'm so small time, I don't understand

1614
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:00,750
how doing something wrong can be right.

1615
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,131
- Oh, go home, Mary Beth.

1616
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:02,964
- I'm done, Christine.

1617
01:17:02,964 --> 01:17:05,900
- Just go home to big
Harvey and little Alice.

1618
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,993
And forget how the real world goes!

1619
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,350
- I'm done with you.

1620
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,933
I thought I'd owe you for
Harvey's life forever.

1621
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,550
I owe you nothing anymore.

1622
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,000
- Sorry about that.

1623
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:35,883
I'm sorry.

1624
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,840
Hey, I'm sorry.

1625
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,297
What do you want from me?!

1626
01:17:56,326 --> 01:17:57,159
Oh God.

1627
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:04,129
I feel like crap.

1628
01:18:06,785 --> 01:18:09,368
(somber music)

1629
01:18:22,683 --> 01:18:24,850
(sobbing)

1630
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,374
- Hi, Martin.

1631
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,340
- There you are.

1632
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,617
- [Mary Beth] I'm late, huh?

1633
01:18:30,617 --> 01:18:31,620
- Ah.

1634
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,660
I was just telling the gang,

1635
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,310
where the hell's my favorite gal?

1636
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,633
- Ooh, well.

1637
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,174
Want a little dinner?

1638
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,968
- (clears throat) Huh?

1639
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,118
- Are you starved?

1640
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,035
- [Martin] I'm starved.

1641
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:47,248
- Mmm.

1642
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,423
Macaroni and cheese.

1643
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:55,795
- [Martin] Hey, what's the matter?

1644
01:18:55,795 --> 01:18:58,010
- [Mary Beth] Nothing.

1645
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,802
- Sit down, kid.

1646
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:01,302
Come on, sit down.

1647
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:05,803
- I just lost a friend.

1648
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,445
My friend.

1649
01:19:08,445 --> 01:19:10,028
- [Martin] You did?

1650
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:14,370
- You think you know a person, I mean,

1651
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,470
we're different, but I...

1652
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,700
At heart I thought we
knew who each other was.

1653
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:26,323
And that's gone now.

1654
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,293
- Hey now, don't worry.

1655
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,123
You got me.

1656
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:42,453
- What did you say?

1657
01:19:42,453 --> 01:19:47,453
- You can always count on me.

1658
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:50,492
(laughing)

1659
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:57,522
- That's right, Martin. (laughing)

1660
01:19:57,522 --> 01:20:02,522
I could always count on you. (laughing)

1661
01:20:02,768 --> 01:20:04,401
(light music)

1662
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:07,068
(both laughing)

1663
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:21,095
(light piano music)

1664
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,110
- Mary Beth?

1665
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:28,413
- [Mary Beth] Yeah.

1666
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,520
- The bust was on the national news.

1667
01:20:32,782 --> 01:20:33,615
- [Mary Beth] Yeah?

1668
01:20:33,615 --> 01:20:35,730
- Yeah, they showed it
in Texas and Florida.

1669
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:36,563
I taped it.

1670
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:41,460
- [Mary Beth] Is Alice asleep?

1671
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,970
- Yeah.

1672
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:45,030
But she wants you to read
her history homework.

1673
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,863
- Okay.

1674
01:20:49,919 --> 01:20:51,553
- Did you see Martin?

1675
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:52,386
- Mhmm.

1676
01:20:53,662 --> 01:20:56,926
And then I went to see Antonio
Grasso's sister-in-law.

1677
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:57,759
- Who?

1678
01:20:57,759 --> 01:20:59,413
- Antonio Grasso from bowling.

1679
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,690
The sister-in-law is Filipina,

1680
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,950
she runs a group home for the elderly.

1681
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,278
And I thought I would
check it out for Martin.

1682
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:10,860
(Harvey chuckling)

1683
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,590
It's clean as a whistle, Harv.

1684
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,170
But homey.

1685
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,600
And it's right in the neighborhood.

1686
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,570
And there's six residents,

1687
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:19,623
two of which are men.

1688
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,880
Which is lucky because

1689
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,020
usually it's all women,

1690
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:25,013
I don't know, he'd go nuts with all women.

1691
01:21:26,134 --> 01:21:27,238
What do you think?

1692
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:28,630
- It won't matter to him.

1693
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:29,680
You know that, right?

1694
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:31,770
- It'll matter to him.

1695
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,970
And it matters to me.

1696
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,870
There's something there, Harv.

1697
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,693
Between him and me.

1698
01:21:44,806 --> 01:21:46,906
And I think it's a gift straight from God.

1699
01:21:59,303 --> 01:22:02,220
(Harvey chuckling)

1700
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:06,733
(bell tolling)

1701
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:12,440
- Pam?

1702
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,273
- [Pam] Hi.

1703
01:22:13,273 --> 01:22:14,106
- Thank you.

1704
01:22:15,186 --> 01:22:16,019
- Have you been waiting long?

1705
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:17,180
- No, I just got here.

1706
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,180
- Sorry, what's up?

1707
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,670
- They've decided on the
appointment to the LEO Board.

1708
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,637
It's not you.

1709
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:39,002
- I hope leaking those files
did your career some good.

1710
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:41,313
Because it didn't do a damn thing for me.

1711
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:46,650
Still, I'm surprised they
went with Gigi Cardenas.

1712
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,400
- Oh no, not after that lesbian stuff.

1713
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,610
You know, it's really
appalling how uptight

1714
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,530
everybody's gotten over lifestyles.

1715
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:55,213
They're naming Audrey Paulson.

1716
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:00,200
- Who's Audrey Paulson?

1717
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,400
- Civil Rights Attorney,
married with a couple kids.

1718
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,850
From what I hear, you got shafted.

1719
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,150
It's a complete double standard.

1720
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:08,033
A guy with your past, no problem.

1721
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,593
- My past?

1722
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:12,413
What past?

1723
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,378
The drinking?

1724
01:23:15,378 --> 01:23:16,950
Are they kidding, oh come on!

1725
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,150
- Chris, it's so disgusting.

1726
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,520
It's not just the drinking and
it's not just all the guys.

1727
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,150
They read it as an instability.

1728
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,390
- All the guys?!

1729
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:24,740
- [Pam] That's what I hear.

1730
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,480
- How would anybody know about any guys?

1731
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,093
- I guess you told somebody.

1732
01:23:35,485 --> 01:23:39,634
(elevator dinging)
(hectic music)

1733
01:23:39,634 --> 01:23:40,467
- May I help you?

1734
01:23:40,467 --> 01:23:42,203
- Yeah I wanna see Mr. Broadbent.

1735
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:45,822
Tell him I've got Willie
May's jock strap for sale.

1736
01:23:45,822 --> 01:23:47,854
That ought to get him out here.

1737
01:23:47,854 --> 01:23:48,687
Forget it.

1738
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,463
- Excuse me, but Mr.
Broadbent is very busy!

1739
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:05,020
- [Christine] Hey, if you wanted to know

1740
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,740
about my sex life, Dan,
all you had to do was ask.

1741
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:09,863
- Excuse me, fellas.

1742
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,150
I owe you an apology.

1743
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:13,940
- Kiss my ass.

1744
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,970
Kiss my Irish ass!

1745
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,613
- I sympathize completely.

1746
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:21,250
The public is on a hair
trigger these days.

1747
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,700
So unwilling to forgive,

1748
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,740
so quick to judge.

1749
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,230
If there's a safer candidate,

1750
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,120
that's the way we have to go.

1751
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:29,953
Now listen.

1752
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,200
I wouldn't pass most of them myself.

1753
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,663
Don't think I'd ever
set judgment of you, I,

1754
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:39,650
- You are slicker than black ice, fella.

1755
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:41,280
The public, what a load of crap!

1756
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,670
The public did not invade my privacy.

1757
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:45,040
The only people who entered my life

1758
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,970
under false pretenses and screwed me blue

1759
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:51,283
were Tom Cornell and yourself.

1760
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,213
And to set me up on the day of my divorce?

1761
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:58,773
You really are a schmuck.

1762
01:25:02,366 --> 01:25:04,949
(somber music)

1763
01:25:11,268 --> 01:25:14,724
(elevator dinging)

1764
01:25:14,724 --> 01:25:15,891
Well, Tom, hi.

1765
01:25:17,303 --> 01:25:19,363
Well come on out, I'm not gonna kill you.

1766
01:25:20,676 --> 01:25:21,800
I'm not gonna carve your heart out

1767
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,240
and stick it on the window

1768
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,990
of a Mexican restaurant.
- Stop this.

1769
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:25,823
- Hey I'm not even gonna go out

1770
01:25:25,823 --> 01:25:28,980
and spread the word
about your dirty deeds.

1771
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,623
After all, you have an
entire career ahead of you.

1772
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,080
No, I'm gonna wait

1773
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,547
till you got a lot more to lose.

1774
01:25:48,478 --> 01:25:49,311
- Cagney!

1775
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,250
Cagney, we're getting a great response

1776
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,083
on this whole thing.

1777
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:53,050
Come on upstairs with me.

1778
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,180
We're gonna debrief the boss

1779
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:56,060
and get a little slice of the glory.

1780
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,730
- [Christine] Okay, I'll get Mary Beth.

1781
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:00,380
- I know, she took off a
couple hours ago, I let her.

1782
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:03,993
- Oh.

1783
01:26:04,871 --> 01:26:06,450
- Her father had a stroke or something.

1784
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:08,947
I didn't hear the details
but it sounded pretty bad.

1785
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:14,158
(equipment beeping)

1786
01:26:15,023 --> 01:26:17,815
- [Announcer] Aileen Wilson, 5243.

1787
01:26:17,815 --> 01:26:18,648
- Martin?

1788
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:28,236
Martin?

1789
01:26:33,803 --> 01:26:34,636
Daddy?

1790
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:55,893
- Hi.

1791
01:27:04,296 --> 01:27:05,129
- Hi.

1792
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,300
They want me to make a
decision and I can't.

1793
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,413
Massive stroke.

1794
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:31,493
Massive, brain damage.

1795
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:34,140
When he went code blue,

1796
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,940
they broke some of his ribs
getting his heart restarted.

1797
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,913
He can't breathe on his
own, he's in a coma.

1798
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,533
Kidneys are failing.

1799
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:50,310
And I'm supposed to,

1800
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,800
I'm supposed to tell
them what he would want.

1801
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,570
I know what I'm supposed to do.

1802
01:28:00,926 --> 01:28:03,093
(sighing)

1803
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:06,550
If it was mother I'd know.

1804
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:10,640
But you have to really, you
have to know someone for that.

1805
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:13,160
Or Harvey.

1806
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,110
How can I decide this for Martin?

1807
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:20,943
It's too late.

1808
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,703
I know what they want.

1809
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,423
They want me to let him go. (sighing)

1810
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,613
I just got him back.

1811
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:48,152
(Mary Beth sobbing)

1812
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,287
(somber music)

1813
01:29:03,501 --> 01:29:05,078
(birds chirping)

1814
01:29:05,078 --> 01:29:05,911
1152.

1815
01:29:13,064 --> 01:29:13,897
1190.

1816
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,103
Here.

1817
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,110
- Yup.
- 1202,

1818
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:21,943
this is it.

1819
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:27,570
What do you think?

1820
01:29:28,983 --> 01:29:31,819
It's an awful lot of money
for a hole in the ground.

1821
01:29:31,819 --> 01:29:32,969
- Well, it's up to you.

1822
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,750
I always figured Dad for
a scatter to the winds

1823
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,583
kind of guy.

1824
01:29:42,493 --> 01:29:44,221
- I want him in Queens.

1825
01:29:44,221 --> 01:29:45,054
- Good.

1826
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:48,380
- I never want to wonder
where he is again.

1827
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,473
This'll be nice.

1828
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,100
Very New York.

1829
01:29:58,162 --> 01:30:00,995
(Harvey laughing)

1830
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:05,654
(Mary Beth sighing)

1831
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:29,488
(light music)

1832
01:30:53,778 --> 01:30:55,028
- Is this okay?

1833
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:07,472
- Okay.

1834
01:31:10,493 --> 01:31:13,320
- I put a call in to Captain
Cardenas this morning.

1835
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,170
I figured you wouldn't wanna miss it.

1836
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:19,181
- [Mary Beth] You got that right.

1837
01:31:24,827 --> 01:31:27,494
(phone ringing)

1838
01:31:31,615 --> 01:31:32,448
- Cagney.

1839
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,683
Yes, Captain.

1840
01:31:39,707 --> 01:31:44,707
Yes, I did call you. (clears throat)

1841
01:31:52,563 --> 01:31:55,063
(light music)

1842
01:32:44,608 --> 01:32:47,441
(Multicom Jingle)
