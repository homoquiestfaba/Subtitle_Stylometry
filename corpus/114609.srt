1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,607
It was the middle of the Earth year 2261.

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,608
The year between wars
and the beginning of a new age.

3
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:20,742
The Shadow War was over, but there was
still a darkness waiting for us at home.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,223
President Santiago had been assassinated,
and his successor President Clark...

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,756
was turning Earth into a prison camp.

6
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,028
We'd broken away from Earth,
and in retaliation, they quarantined us...

7
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,293
trying to strangle our supply lines.

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,932
We were desperate...

9
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:39,165
and we couldn't afford to lose
even a single supply ship.

10
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:43,973
In the midst of all of this,
we made contact with Thirdspace...

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,239
and we almost didn't survive it.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,310
I only hope we never
come across it again...

13
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,248
because next time,
no one's going to survive it.

14
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,741
Delta 7, they're coming in behind you.

15
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,745
Watch your 12.

16
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,307
Form up. Keep them away from
the transport. We can't let them get it.

17
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,443
Roger that.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,987
Deltas 2 and 9,
I'll lay down suppressing fire.

19
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,955
- Cover me.
- Right behind you.

20
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,828
Stand by.

21
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,189
Break, Fox 2!

22
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,871
Commander lvanova to raiding party.
We're too evenly matched. You can't win.

23
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,077
I suggest that you surrender or withdraw
before you're destroyed.

24
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,483
Not a chance.

25
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,155
We know there's Quantium 40
aboard that ship.

26
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,659
It's going for millions of credits,
and we're not leaving without it.

27
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,420
Tough. You're not getting it.

28
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,392
We could make a deal,
give you a piece of the action.

29
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,800
Forget it. There's no way
you're coming out of this a winner.

30
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,496
At best, it's a standoff.

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,435
You mean, it was a standoff.

32
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,007
Now, about that surrender.

33
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,952
That's funny.
I was just about to say the same thing.

34
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,958
This is the White Star fleet
to raiding party.

35
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,696
We've just cut off your means of escape...

36
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,671
and the nearest jumpgate
is several hours from here.

37
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,768
You've got nowhere to go.

38
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,205
We have locked
our weapons onto your ships.

39
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,208
Surrender and prepare to be boarded.

40
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,213
I won't ask again.

41
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,021
We hear you.

42
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,621
Standing down.

43
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,894
A wise move.

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,426
Commander lvanova, since this mousetrap
was your idea, you get to go home...

45
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,799
while we escort these gentlemen
to the penal colony in the Drazi Freehold.

46
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,841
Are you sure I can't go with you?

47
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,036
I want to see their faces
when they get a sniff of Drazi cooking.

48
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,703
Negative, Commander.

49
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:39,751
Make sure everyone hears about this.
If we can make the raiders worry...

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,184
that every valuable cargo might be
another mousetrap, it'll discourage them...

51
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,658
from hitting more ships
bound for Babylon 5.

52
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,751
Thank you, sir.

53
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:53,060
With this embargo against the station,
we need every supply ship we can get.

54
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,798
Basically, I should just take my cheese
and go home. Is that it?

55
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,336
That's affirmative.

56
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,367
You got them to risk
exposing that battle wagon...

57
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,604
they've been using as a base,
so you're entitled to a little rest.

58
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,438
Will do. See you back at the barn.

59
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:11,847
Let's go, Delta Squadron, it's a long way
to the nearest jumpgate. Maximum burn.

60
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,041
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,309
That's all right. It's perfectly all right.
I've waited a long time for this.

62
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,010
- I can wait a few more minutes.
- So now he's patient.

63
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,850
- Twenty years ago you weren't so patient.
- Twenty years ago I had twenty years.

64
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,652
Now I got Felmar's Syndrome, I'm 65,
I don't know how much time I've got.

65
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,387
I would like to get some satisfaction
before I die.

66
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,689
Mr. Rosen...

67
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,358
Alex. Please call me Alex.
Him, you can call Mr. Rosen.

68
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,799
A very unfriendly man
once you get to know him.

69
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,360
Alex, your brother tells me
that you have agreed...

70
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,168
to a telepathic scan,
but I need you to confirm this.

71
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,699
Fine. I confirm.
I'm only doing this because he's sick.

72
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:16,075
Supposedly sick.
You don't look like a very sick man to me.

73
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,149
You, however, don't look so well.
Are you okay?

74
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,088
I'm fine. Just a headache.

75
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,517
I sympathize. Whatever he's paying you,
it's not enough.

76
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,290
For your information,
this won't be a deep scan.

77
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,323
I'll be looking at surface thoughts only.
Answer yes or no to the questions.

78
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,859
I will determine whether you're telling
the truth. Any questions?

79
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:43,398
Questions? No, I have no questions.
Leo has all the questions. Go ahead, ask.

80
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,936
Yes, I've been waiting a long time for this.
Now we'll finally get to the truth.

81
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,207
Waiting, waiting all this time...

82
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,683
Twenty years ago,
I said you were having an affair...

83
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,555
No, I know you were having an affair
with my wife.

84
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,356
He was always crazy jealous,
wouldn't listen to reason.

85
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:07,695
We haven't spoken to each other
in two decades, not that it's a bad thing.

86
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,559
He denied the whole thing,
so it made me look like a fool...

87
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,902
so Sheila left me,
the whole family sided with him.

88
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,244
Alex, you and I know the truth.
I haven't got long left.

89
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,646
So let's let everybody know the truth.
I want to get some satisfaction.

90
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,808
Were you having an affair with my wife?

91
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,523
- This won't hurt, will it?
- You won't feel a thing.

92
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,083
Good, because I had this tooth removed,
and they said the same thing...

93
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,493
Were you having an affair with my wife?

94
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,624
No! I was not having an affair with Sheila.

95
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,407
Is he telling the truth?

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,481
- Yes, he's telling the truth.
- I'm sorry. What?

97
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
She said I'm telling the truth.

98
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,149
What part of that sentence
don't you understand?

99
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,115
You missed something, maybe.

100
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,422
- It's probably dark in there, so...
- It's not necessary...

101
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,396
You know, I think, maybe
Alex is so guilty about what he did to me...

102
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,831
he's blanked it all out like it didn't happen.

103
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,200
I am trained to separate
false memories from real ones.

104
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,068
Look, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

105
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,839
- I'm really not feeling well.
- That's a good idea.

106
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,575
Have a nice lie-down, a cup of tea,
you'll feel better.

107
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,640
I want to thank you for your time...

108
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,016
you are a lovely young woman,
and if I was 30 years younger...

109
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,248
and you were a little blind in one eye...

110
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,883
what a wonderful life
we could have together.

111
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,592
I'll need the balance of my fee
deposited by morning.

112
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,598
Twenty years.
How could I have been so stupid?

113
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,737
Sorry.

114
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,278
I'm picking something up.

115
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,598
Say again, Delta 7. You're breaking up.

116
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,931
I'm getting a reading
on the long-range scanners.

117
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,939
It's way off the beacon.
Transferring data to your system.

118
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,175
Whatever it is, it's huge.

119
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,941
Delta Squadron to Babylon 5.
Do you copy, Babylon Control?

120
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,150
Confirm, Delta Squadron.
This is Babylon Control.

121
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,452
Have you had any reports
of missing ships in this area?

122
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,823
Negative, Delta 1. What have you got?

123
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,692
I'm not sure.
It's almost as big as an explorer ship.

124
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,790
It's at least half a mile across.
It's well off the jump beacons.

125
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,028
It may have been damaged or lost power...

126
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,697
and been pulled off course
by the hyperspace tides.

127
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,502
Can you leave a marker?
We'll send an investigating team.

128
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,634
Negative. It's moving diagonal
to the beacon.

129
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,976
If we leave it now, we'll never find it again.
We'll investigate and get back to you.

130
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,608
Delta Leader out. Are you there, Delta 7?

131
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,151
Right here, Delta Leader.

132
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,312
We'll go after it.
We'll determine what it is...

133
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,720
and see if it's safe
to call in a rescue operation.

134
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,123
We'll form a relay from the homing beacon
to avoid getting lost.

135
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,058
Roger that, Delta Leader.

136
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,324
Delta 6, you're the anchor.

137
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,499
Hold here so we can link to your signal...

138
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,035
and extend toward the target
like a string of pearls.

139
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,868
Don't stray or you'll lose contact
and get lost in the gravitational eddies.

140
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,272
Then we'll have two rescue missions
to worry about.

141
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:40,278
Be careful, only a moron would go this far
off the beacon on purpose.

142
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,945
There's still a chance it could be a trap.

143
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,423
Distance to target?

144
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,526
Estimate 3,000 kilometers.

145
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,571
Distance to relay ship: 1,000 kilometers.

146
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,339
Delta 9, take relay position and maintain.

147
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,172
Roger that, Delta Leader.

148
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,748
The bounce-back signal is everywhere.
It doesn't make any sense.

149
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,754
Whatever's out there
doesn't match any known silhouette.

150
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,653
Possible first-contact situation?

151
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:29,184
Whatever it is, it isn't under power.
It's definitely either dead or abandoned.

152
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,055
Damn, that thing's big.

153
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,568
- Delta 4 taking relay position.
- Acknowledged, Delta 4.

154
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,572
We're almost to target.
Should have it on visual any time now.

155
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,602
Stay close and go weapons hot...

156
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,406
but nobody fires without authorization.
Keep scanning.

157
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,142
Still nothing.

158
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,584
We should be on top of it by now.

159
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,896
Oh, hell.

160
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,933
Delta Leader to Babylon Control.

161
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,810
C&C on-line.

162
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:24,342
We'll launch a salvage operation. We need
five White Stars and some Starfuries.

163
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,681
Make sure they're armed
and running weapons hot.

164
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,811
This thing could be dangerous.

165
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,721
Confirmed. How many Starfuries
do you want?

166
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,724
All of them.

167
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,336
- Any word from lvanova?
- She's about to arrive.

168
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,246
- Thought she'd be here.
- We're having to move the struts...

169
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,444
of the jumpgate far enough
to allow the artifact to get through.

170
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,419
- It's that big?
- Bigger.

171
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,993
Optimum distance achieved.
You're clear for jump, Commander.

172
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,388
Roger that, C&C. We're coming in.

173
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,975
I hope you understand
that this is a bit awkward for me...

174
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,285
but with Londo back home,
things kind of fall onto me.

175
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,823
With financial matters,
the League expects the Centauri...

176
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,384
to speak on their behalf.

177
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,056
It's all right, Vir. What is it?

178
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,034
The artifact that you brought back
from hyperspace...

179
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,072
the others would like to know what it is.

180
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:06,104
Then we have something in common.
We'd like to know that for ourselves.

181
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,011
But it's going to take a while
to figure that out.

182
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,513
All we do know is that it's very old.

183
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,951
What it is and what it does,
your guess is as good as mine.

184
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,889
In that case, can they take part
in examining the artifact?

185
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,628
- Not at this time, no.
- Vir, we understand their interest.

186
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,591
The race that created this artifact
must have been extremely advanced.

187
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,194
There may be some valuable
technology inside.

188
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,673
But if everyone starts pulling at it at once,
nothing will get done.

189
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,643
Delenn and I discussed this earlier,
and we both agreed...

190
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,374
that anything we find will be shared
with everyone...

191
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,416
in the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.

192
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,748
That's all well and good,
because you trust her and she trusts you...

193
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,412
and I trust both of you.

194
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,219
That's the sort I am. I'm the trusting kind,
you know, ever since I was...

195
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,729
Anyway, the others don't trust anyone,
especially when it comes to money.

196
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,363
- Would you like me to speak to them?
- No.

197
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,834
It's not the speaking that's the problem.
It's the listening.

198
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,840
Still, I'll see what I can do.

199
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,805
Perhaps Vir is right.

200
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,447
No matter how much we reassure them...

201
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,487
the other races will always think
we're holding something back.

202
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,387
I know. We can't take that chance.

203
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,589
You know as well as I do...

204
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,522
they'll be grabbing stuff
as soon as they get there.

205
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,533
And if it looks like someone
is going to get a new weapon...

206
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,764
before they can, they'll sabotage it.
They'll blow it up.

207
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,601
No. There's no other way.

208
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,172
They may have resources
that could be useful.

209
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,304
Babylon 5 is a diplomatic station,
a free port.

210
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,109
Not a research facility.

211
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,485
We have no archeologists,
no experts in alien technology.

212
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,521
I know.
So it'll take us a little longer, that's all.

213
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,412
But we'll get there.

214
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,589
May I assume that this has nothing to do
with you wanting to be...

215
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,154
the first to unlock whatever secrets
this thing brings with it?

216
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,231
Me? When have you ever known me
to have a personal agenda?

217
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,070
John, whenever something comes
into our proximity...

218
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:20,703
that has to do with the unknown,
your eyes light up like two tiny suns.

219
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,612
And you know what words
these two tiny lights spell out?

220
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,718
- What?
- "Mine."

221
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,549
Now, that is a lie.

222
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,987
- Minbari do not lie.
- Then it is slander.

223
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,082
To be slander, it must be false.

224
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,758
That's two down.

225
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,661
- Then it's damned inconvenient.
- The truth always is.

226
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,794
Besides...

227
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,088
it is mine.

228
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,126
Investigation team, this is Security.
I'm making out signs of weapon fire...

229
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,689
on the outside of this... Whatever it is.

230
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,865
Suggest you proceed with caution.

231
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:56,431
Place could be rigged with booby traps,
bombs, other defense systems, anything.

232
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,807
Until we know what this is
and where it came from...

233
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,482
we have to definitely consider it
a potential threat to station security.

234
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:09,351
Team One to Security. We'll be careful.
It's beautiful, though.

235
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,485
Yeah, it is that. But so is a cobra.

236
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,493
So be damned careful.
I don't want anybody to get bit.

237
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:23,127
Understood. Okay, everybody,
move to prescribed safe distance.

238
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,662
Sending in a maint bot
to take a surface sample.

239
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,691
Stand by. We got a problem.

240
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,521
What's the problem? Talk to me.

241
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,927
Registering a 15% drop
in the bot's power supply.

242
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,825
20%, 50%.

243
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,331
- All right, move it away. Pull it back.
- Not responding.

244
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,198
80%, it's dead.

245
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,647
We still don't have a lot to go on,
but it looks as if the device...

246
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,518
drained every last milliwatt of power.
We can't even recharge it.

247
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,318
We've tried three times,
and the charge doesn't stick.

248
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,849
Why didn't it affect our Starfuries
when we pulled it out of hyperspace?

249
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,955
I don't know. My guess is that it has to do
with the proximity of the power source.

250
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,933
You were able to fire grapples
from a safe distance...

251
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,301
the bot and its power source
were within just a few feet.

252
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,398
I'll let you know when we finish
the rest of our test.

253
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,634
The power drain seems to be short-range,
so if we're lucky...

254
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,237
it won't constitute a hazard to navigation.

255
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:48,208
We'll have to make sure to keep a distance
or come up with some kind of shielding.

256
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,688
But that'll make it nearly impossible
to do a proper analysis.

257
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,619
Sheridan. Go.

258
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,025
Captain, we've got a ship from IPX
coming in through the gate.

259
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,325
Interplanetary Expeditions? That was fast.

260
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,629
I figured they'd hear about it,
they got sources everywhere.

261
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,137
Did anyone tell them we're not having
anything to do with Earth anymore?

262
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,164
Confirmed. But one of the passengers
is still asking to speak with you.

263
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,806
All right. My office, 20 minutes.

264
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,709
If you'll excuse me...

265
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,310
I think I have some old-fashioned
horse-trading to do.

266
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,281
The vultures are starting to circle.

267
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,758
I thought they only circled
after you were dead.

268
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,022
Maybe they know something we don't.

269
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,739
There is danger.

270
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,706
Dr. Elizabeth Trent, field coordinator
for Interplanetary Expeditions.

271
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,577
It's a pleasure to meet you.

272
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,980
It's certainly a surprise to meet you.

273
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,953
In case you hadn't heard, we're
on President Clark's quarantined list.

274
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,047
No ship from Earth
is allowed to dock at Babylon 5.

275
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,588
We're aware of the embargo,
but IPX is a special case.

276
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,793
- May we?
- Sure. Make yourself at home.

277
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,797
- Let me get right to the point, Captain.
- I expect nothing less.

278
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,533
We'd like access
to the alien artifact parked outside.

279
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,348
I'll certainly take your request
under consideration.

280
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,949
That's bureaucratese for "take a hike."

281
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,747
It is, indeed.

282
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,625
Captain, you're not set up to investigate
a find like this.

283
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,990
You don't have the people, the equipment,
or the training.

284
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,560
Now, you could poke around
like aborigines playing with a Starfury.

285
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,366
And maybe you might find
something useful by sheer accident.

286
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,708
But maybe you'll push the wrong button,
blow yourself up.

287
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,869
I know. Exciting, isn't it?

288
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,745
All right. What do you want?

289
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,013
First, some information.

290
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,089
Why aren't you or your people
afraid of retribution...

291
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,989
for breaking the embargo?

292
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,486
IPX is a multiplanetary corporation.

293
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,125
We have agreements with over
half a dozen alien governments...

294
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,192
allowing us movement
across borders without restrictions.

295
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,204
We can explore any world...

296
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,237
provided we guarantee access
to whatever we find.

297
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,106
You see, there's politics,
and there's business.

298
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,645
This is business.
Your problems have nothing to do with us.

299
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,615
- You can come and go as you want?
- That's correct.

300
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,325
All right. Then here's the deal.

301
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,926
I'll give you access to the artifact.

302
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,525
You will work with my people at all times.

303
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,004
You will give us full access to your data
at every step along the way.

304
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:06,066
We have first call on anything you find.
If the technology behind that thing...

305
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,840
can be used by Earth
against the other races...

306
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,309
that information never leaves here.

307
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,012
- Captain, l...
- You try, we'll destroy it.

308
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,488
You wouldn't. That's the find of a lifetime.

309
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:27,693
It's scrap metal, guaranteed.
I will pull the trigger myself if I have to.

310
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,724
- Second.
- There's more?

311
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,567
Thanks to the blockade, we are
running short of supplies around here.

312
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,433
Spare parts,
certain foods we can't grow...

313
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,442
And you want us to break the blockade
and bring you whatever supplies you need.

314
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,907
If you're going to work here,
you may as well bring lunch.

315
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,281
I'm just trying to make sure
you bring enough for everybody.

316
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,688
All right, Captain. Let me think about it.

317
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,851
We still have to decide if what's out there
is worth all these conditions.

318
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,219
Sheridan.

319
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,561
They finished going over
the sample we took from the alien artifact.

320
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,295
The carbon dating indicates
that whatever that thing is...

321
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,428
it's over a million years old.

322
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,508
Still thinking about it, Doc?

323
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,343
Have your people stand by, Captain.
We have a deal.

324
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,563
Don't put that there.
Never mind. Okay. Forget it.

325
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,070
Excuse me, I would appreciate it
if you keep this whole area clear.

326
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,072
There's explosives... Thank you.

327
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:47,605
- You should see your face.
- This is horrific. I mean, look at this!

328
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,673
You know, back home on Earth...

329
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:55,083
along the Amazon in South America,
they've got these army ants.

330
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,479
They sweep across the forest
in a 5-inch carpet, millions of them.

331
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,557
They're no more than an inch long,
but they can devastate a forest...

332
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,220
in less than an hour.

333
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,193
I wonder if they know they've got cousins
this far out in space.

334
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,059
You think anybody would notice
if I just killed a few of them?

335
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,099
- Well, how many?
- I don't know.

336
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,835
- Ten?
- Yes, they'd notice it.

337
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,709
- Six?
- Go for it.

338
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,241
Commander? Dr. Elizabeth Trent, IPX.

339
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,152
I assume Capt. Sheridan's briefed you
on our mission.

340
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,689
Yes. Actually, this is my station, Doctor.

341
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,191
Anything happens around here,
I know about it.

342
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,852
This is Dr. Stephen Franklin.

343
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,658
You'll be coordinating with him
on any organic findings.

344
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,460
- Nice to meet you.
- Doctor.

345
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,034
I think we should get together
for a few minutes.

346
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,828
Discuss how we want to split up work
before things get crazy.

347
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,569
"Before things get crazy." I see.
What exactly would you call this?

348
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,736
Science.

349
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,576
Dr. Trent, could you take a look at this?

350
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,115
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

351
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,947
Maybe if I just killed one of them,
that would do me.

352
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,957
In that case, I think I should be elsewhere.

353
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,250
Watch out!

354
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,563
That's it. I'm going to go get some sleep.

355
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,417
Lyta.

356
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,796
Long day?

357
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,601
Seems like
they just keep getting longer every day.

358
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,567
Looks like you've had
one of those days yourself.

359
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,937
Believe me, I understand.
One damn thing after another.

360
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,642
Listen, Lyta,
there's something I wanted to...

361
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,019
- Warning, power failure.
- There you go.

362
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,255
- Security to C&C.
- On-line.

363
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,454
We got a power failure in Tube 9.
What's the story?

364
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,097
We've been having power fluctuations
for the last couple of hours.

365
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,260
We'll get it back on ASAP.
It'll just be a minute.

366
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,068
"Lt'll just be a minute."

367
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,011
As long as we're not going anywhere...

368
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,446
I wanted to, you know...

369
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,146
I wanted to ask you...

370
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,856
Do you want to go out sometime?

371
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,223
I don't know, get some dinner,
maybe catch a vid?

372
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,555
Bottom line is...

373
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,325
I like you.

374
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,833
I've liked you ever since you got here.

375
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,905
I know things have been tough
on you lately...

376
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,571
and I know I could do right by you.

377
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,777
I'm not the Captain.

378
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,716
I don't bring in big bucks.
I'm nothing to write home about.

379
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,812
I know there's a big gap between us.
The life that you lead...

380
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,518
that maybe I could never understand...
Maybe I could understand.

381
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,650
Maybe I could try.

382
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,728
You're the kind of person
makes a guy want to try.

383
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,596
There's something about you...

384
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,073
frankly, I'm nuts about.

385
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,004
So I think it would be great...

386
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,380
if, you know,
maybe I could see you once in a while.

387
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,119
Listen, you don't have to answer now.

388
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,622
Take your time. Think about it for a while.

389
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,686
Not to imply that you have to answer,
because you don't.

390
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,062
You don't owe me one, that's for sure.

391
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,563
I think that I could care for you.

392
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,873
You've been through a lot.

393
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,779
And I guess I just wanna do for you.

394
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,758
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.
I didn't mean to offend you.

395
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,562
This was probably the wrong time.
Both had a hard day.

396
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,201
We've gotta work together.
You know how that goes.

397
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,837
It's just...

398
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,470
awkward.

399
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:24,341
So maybe you're right.
Maybe it's best that we don't.

400
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,039
Power restored.

401
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,317
Looks like they fixed it.

402
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:34,084
I can't remember where I'm going.
My brain jumped the track. It does that.

403
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:40,355
Look, tell you what. Like I said, I'm sorry.

404
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,923
I shouldn't have said anything.

405
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,836
Let's just pretend that this didn't happen.

406
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,774
This way, you won't be embarrassed...

407
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:59,211
I won't be embarrassed,
and I promise I'll never bring it up again.

408
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,816
Unless you bring it up first.

409
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,355
I guess this is where I get off.

410
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,658
Look, I hope I wasn't
too far out of line, Lyta.

411
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,056
I hope...

412
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,392
Good night, Lyta.

413
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,738
Maybe it was for the best.

414
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,472
Three dates,
I probably would have married her.

415
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,424
How's that beam coming?

416
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,190
Moving into position.

417
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,602
Better check those struts.
Make sure they're ready to hold this thing.

418
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:59,036
- I don't wanna mess with this twice.
- Roger that. Stand by.

419
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:08,247
- Control, what's with the bots?
- What about them?

420
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,852
You mean, you're not doing that?

421
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,427
Mayday, C&C!
They're on a collision course!

422
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,266
I repeat, they're going to ram the artifact!

423
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,880
C&C, we can't override the bots.
You've gotta stop them.

424
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,946
We've got it. Stay clear.

425
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,436
Take them out!

426
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,707
Alpha Squadron to C&C.

427
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,275
Targets destroyed.
You get someone in Maintenance...

428
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,615
to find out what happened.

429
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,083
Miller, Jankowski, hang back,
seal off this section. Rest of you, with me.

430
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,651
Aye, Chief.

431
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,301
- I don't believe it!
- Is he alive?

432
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,933
He's okay. Jason, get a med team up here
just to make sure.

433
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,477
Medlab, we need
a med team in Maintenance.

434
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,212
Security override nonfunctional.

435
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,510
Take it down.

436
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,123
Lights.

437
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,270
Lyta?

438
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,884
We have to stop it.

439
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,366
Where's that med team?

440
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:48,405
And you can't remember anything
since yesterday afternoon?

441
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,807
No, nothing.

442
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,219
How did you get into
the main bot control room?

443
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,085
- I don't know.
- What were you doing there?

444
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,358
Stephen, what part of "I don't know"
is unclear? Look, this is me.

445
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,730
If I knew what happened in there,
I would tell you.

446
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,192
I don't mean to be short with you.
I'm as confused by this as you are.

447
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,237
It's possible that you were walking
in your sleep.

448
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:20,336
Telepaths are prone
to eccentric dream behavior.

449
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,743
But I've never done that before.

450
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,642
Which means it may have
needed a trigger event...

451
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,208
for your subconscious
to get things moving.

452
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:33,479
Can you think of any reason why
you would want to destroy the artifact?

453
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,492
No, well...

454
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,759
Not really. I've just...

455
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,262
Ever since it got here,
I've had the strangest feeling about it.

456
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,570
Like I've seen it before somewhere.

457
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,536
Makes me nervous.

458
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:57,302
And before you ask, no, I don't know why.
It just does.

459
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,743
Look, I'm really tired. Can I go,
or am I being placed under arrest?

460
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:07,552
No, you can go. Let me give you
something to help you sleep.

461
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,464
She knows she's being watched.

462
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,357
The security cameras are carefully hidden.

463
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:22,372
Yes, but she knows where the camera is,
and she knows we're watching her.

464
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:26,204
Just look at her.
Is there another camera in there?

465
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,047
- Yes, but...
- Humor me. Switch to the alternate view.

466
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,119
Well, that's a neat trick.

467
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,256
A low-rated commercial telepath
can't sense electronics like that.

468
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,819
Only a P-9 or above could do that.

469
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:47,125
- Lyta's a P-5.
- So you told me.

470
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:51,092
But that rating was determined before
she went to the Vorlon homeworld...

471
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,068
as you very well know.

472
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,804
How do you know about that?

473
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:02,870
IPX tracks every long-range ship
that approaches quarantined space.

474
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,275
We probably know more about it
than you do.

475
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,016
According to our records...

476
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,383
two years before the war between
the Vorlons and Shadows heated up...

477
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,252
Lyta was on Mars,
on the run from the psi corps.

478
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:17,588
While there, she arranged
to meet a starship captain, David Slayner.

479
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,661
According to information
we received from Slayner...

480
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,724
she told him she felt drawn
to the Vorlon homeworld...

481
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,932
the result of a previous encounter
with the Vorlon Ambassador, Kosh.

482
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,040
Until this time, anyone who entered
Vorlon space never came back.

483
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,874
So the Captain
was understandably reluctant.

484
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,041
But the money was right, so they went.

485
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,783
He took her as far as their border.

486
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,255
They sent a continuous signal
inviting the Vorlons to appear.

487
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,358
After several days,
when the Vorlons didn't show...

488
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,726
the Captain decided to head back.

489
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,425
At that point,
Lyta commandeered a life pod...

490
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,524
and ejected into Vorlon space.

491
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,934
The Captain wisely took off
and never saw her again.

492
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,569
We suspect
that was what they were waiting for.

493
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,306
Life pods are short-ranged craft.

494
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,578
She was 10 days away
from the nearest jumpgate...

495
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,677
with only three days
of air, food, and water.

496
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:20,884
There is no way she could have survived
if the Vorlons hadn't come for her.

497
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,654
Our records also indicate
that while she was there...

498
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,788
the Vorlons altered her,
increased her ability.

499
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,692
Assuming that you're right...

500
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,600
I'm surprised that you haven't
been keeping an eye on her.

501
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,169
What makes you think we haven't?

502
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,109
Captain, in the past the Vorlons have done
everything in their power...

503
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,236
to keep humans from getting their hands
on advanced technology.

504
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,873
If she is under their influence,
she may have tried...

505
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,077
to destroy the artifact
to keep us from figuring out what it is.

506
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:52,782
She may not even know she's doing it.
Nonetheless, she's a danger to the project.

507
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,115
I suggest you keep her
under house arrest...

508
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,059
until we do a little more groundwork
on this thing.

509
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,931
I'll consider your suggestion.

510
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,930
That's it? You'll consider it?

511
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,663
We do have this little thing
called due process, Dr. Trent.

512
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,340
We'll keep an eye on her.

513
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,571
There's no proof this was anything
other than an isolated incident.

514
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,909
If that changes, we'll take action,
but not before.

515
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:22,612
In the meantime, I suggest you attend
to the artifact and leave the station to us.

516
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,519
Suit yourself.

517
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,494
But if she endangers any of my crew,
we'll take care of her ourselves...

518
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,096
and worry about due process later.

519
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,806
Probe One to Base,
we are ready to proceed.

520
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,476
Stand by.

521
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,376
- Activate light grid.
- Okay.

522
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,616
Activating scanner array.

523
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,423
Let's start with a metallurgical analysis...

524
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,332
and continue
with a deep-field resonance scan.

525
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,867
Let's see what's inside that thing.

526
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,810
Probe One, we're losing the light a little.
Can you correct?

527
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,848
Confirmed. Increasing power
of the lighting grid.

528
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,483
Perfect.

529
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,096
Keep it away!

530
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,962
It knows we're here!

531
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,732
Don't you hear me? Don't you understand?

532
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,663
Keep it away!

533
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,940
It's looking at us right now!

534
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,579
Keep it away!

535
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,388
Report 17.

536
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,621
A hundred years ago
the Centauri gave us jumpgates...

537
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,687
and changed the future forever.

538
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,692
The artifact may be even more important.

539
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,232
Preliminary findings have
started coming in...

540
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:58,173
and they confirm that the alien artifact
is definitely not a ship...

541
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,309
but rather a mechanism.

542
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,443
We're picking up readings
beyond anything we've seen before.

543
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,912
I think I have an idea
what it may be designed for...

544
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,318
but as long as it's sitting dead in space,
I can't be sure.

545
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,252
We have to probe further,
and we have to do it soon...

546
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,590
before anyone else starts poking around.

547
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,959
If I'm right, what we're looking at here...

548
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,363
could make jumpgates
look like nothing in comparison.

549
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:31,338
This could be the most
significant discovery in human history.

550
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,074
It could change...

551
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,878
everything.

552
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,390
And so far, we've had 10 outbreaks
in the last five hours.

553
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,287
That's just in down below.

554
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:53,060
- What kind of outbreaks?
- Fights, mainly.

555
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,997
We found some people
locked in their rooms just...

556
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,827
screaming.

557
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,099
Same in the Zocalo, Green Sector,
the Casino...

558
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,600
we've given the worst cases to medlab
to see what they can do.

559
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:09,669
The rest we've got in lockup,
but we're gonna run out of room soon...

560
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,146
unless this stops.

561
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,210
- All this started after the artifact got here?
- Definitely.

562
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,982
- You think there's a connection?
- I don't know.

563
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,125
All right, I want write-ups
on every incident...

564
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,287
that happens in the next 10 hours.

565
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,359
Anything they say,
I want it taken down for analysis.

566
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,963
Maybe there's a connection...

567
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,198
or there's just a whole lot of full moons...

568
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,298
all lined up, beaming bozo rays
into everybody's brains.

569
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,969
But, either way, I want answers.

570
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,038
All right, that's all.

571
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,181
Good work. Get some sleep.

572
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,401
Beautiful.

573
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,914
God, it's so beautiful.

574
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,596
It's beautiful, isn't it?

575
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,742
I want to go there.

576
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,302
I want to be there.

577
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,952
What...

578
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,489
is it?

579
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,160
You shouldn't ask questions like that.

580
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,252
I'm sorry, is there something
I could do for you?

581
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,592
Why don't you take a picture?
Lt'll last longer.

582
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,967
You're not moving fast enough.

583
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:10,131
You have to go faster.
You have to make it work.

584
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,151
- What have you found so far?
- Nothing I feel confident talking about.

585
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:32,025
- You've had five days.
- We have barely scratched the surface.

586
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:36,599
Look, with all due respect,
this is not your area of expertise.

587
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,031
It's not like you can push a button on it...

588
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,629
and a manual pops out
and tells you what it is and how it works.

589
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,903
I could study that thing for five years,
let alone five days...

590
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,443
and still not crack it.

591
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,809
Science does not pay attention to a clock.

592
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,839
It'll take however much time
it needs to take. No less. No more.

593
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,717
You're right. I'm not a xeno-archeologist.
But my wife was.

594
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,446
She talked about her work, same as I did.

595
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,754
After a while, you pick up a few things.

596
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,157
By this time, you should have...

597
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,094
surface reports,
magnetic resonance scans...

598
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:11,362
some idea if it's a ship or a mechanism,
and a general notion of what it does...

599
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,666
whether or not you've figured out
the specifics of it yet.

600
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:19,335
In a conventional dig, that's true.
But this is hardly conventional.

601
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,741
There we agree.
Nothing about this is conventional.

602
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,713
Ever since we brought it here
we've had a 30% increase...

603
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,646
in violent activity on the station.

604
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:30,550
Captain, that is your problem.
That has nothing to do with me.

605
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,780
Maybe. But what if you're wrong?

606
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,383
Look, Captain, I'm sorry.

607
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,657
I'm working on two hours of sleep
out of the last 36.

608
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:44,262
Right now, I'm running on adrenaline
and coffee. I don't have time for this.

609
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,059
Now, you gave me permission
to handle this thing...

610
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,105
and I'm doing the best job I know how...

611
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:52,869
with limited resources
and not a hell of a lot of cooperation.

612
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,309
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna get back to work.

613
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:58,905
Is that a copy of the hieroglyph
you found on the artifact?

614
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,344
Yes.

615
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:05,218
- That's Vorlon.
- You know Vorlon?

616
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:06,855
You'd be surprised.

617
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,221
Any good xeno-archaeologist
would have recognized it...

618
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,421
and any decent one
would have mentioned having found it.

619
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:18,466
I am giving you another 48 hours.
Then I want a report on your findings.

620
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,902
If I don't like what I see,
I am pulling the plug.

621
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,131
- Is that clear?
- Whatever.

622
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,177
Okay, Deuce, I'm gonna ask you again.

623
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,811
What were you doing
in the maintenance area?

624
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:41,117
You were trying to open up
the airlocks. Now why?

625
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,052
I was going to go for a walk.

626
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,227
Do you know what
explosive decompression looks like?

627
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,736
Do you have any idea
what it would do to this place?

628
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,533
I wanted to go outside.

629
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,573
- Why?
- Because it's outside.

630
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:03,673
It's calling me. It's calling all of us.

631
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,612
They know who we are, they're in the city.

632
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,750
- What city?
- You know.

633
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,981
You've been there. You've seen.

634
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,194
I can tell by looking at you.

635
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,856
We belong to them, you know.

636
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,733
And they're going to come for us soon.

637
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,530
We have to open the door.
We have no choice.

638
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,068
Those of us who hear the call...

639
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,607
we belong to them.

640
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,313
The others, who do not hear the call...

641
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,177
will not survive it.

642
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,090
That's it. Get him out of here.

643
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:51,018
Maybe the doc can figure him out.

644
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,896
I just don't get it. I mean...

645
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,591
Deuce is a survivor.
He runs half the rackets down below.

646
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,362
- He wouldn't do anything this stupid.
- I agree.

647
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,968
What was that about a city?

648
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,736
Nothing. He was just
getting to me, that's all.

649
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,441
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive. What else could it be?

650
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,742
Still, let me hear if anybody else
talks about this, all right?

651
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,925
- Engineering, what's your ETA?
- About 15 minutes.

652
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,486
Great. Yeah, that's an affirmative.

653
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:31,197
Bill, what's the penalty for killing a captain
aboard his own vessel?

654
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,758
It's death by spacing.

655
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,669
- How long does it take?
- About three, four minutes.

656
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,207
A couple of minutes less,
it might have been worth it.

657
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,405
Imagine the nerve of this guy blaming us
for his problems enforcing discipline.

658
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:46,609
Well, in all fairness, things have been
getting strange since we got here.

659
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,947
Just this morning,
while I was having breakfast...

660
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,577
there were all these people who...

661
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:54,090
You know what? I know what he's doing.
He wants this all to himself.

662
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:57,388
He wants us to do all the hard work,
and he'll just come right in...

663
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,190
and grab all the credit
right out from under us.

664
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,961
No way in hell.

665
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,931
This thing is gonna make my career, Bill.
I won't have it.

666
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,804
We have to accelerate the program.

667
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,273
Elizabeth, I want to show you something.

668
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,374
- This grid. Is this a power relay?
- We think so. Dr. Mankowitz believes...

669
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:23,146
that an external power source was used
to kick-start the internal generators.

670
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,948
- They look damaged.
- Someone wanted to shut that down.

671
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,490
They shot out the internal relays
of the power grid.

672
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:32,358
After that, whatever original charge it had
dissipated while it was drifting...

673
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,896
through hyperspace.

674
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,989
I want it reconnected.

675
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:40,360
Use spit and baling wire if you have to,
but I want those relays connected.

676
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,136
Let's use our biggest power cells.
See if that works.

677
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:47,836
I don't think it's wise,
not until we know what it is. The risks...

678
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,436
Are insignificant compared to the benefits.

679
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,713
I am sorry.

680
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,213
A radical move like that
requires the two of us agree.

681
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,344
I don't.

682
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,749
Bill, we have to do this.

683
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,727
Then convince me.

684
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,897
What I'm about to tell you
does not leave this room.

685
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,196
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

686
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:17,540
For 200 years,
after we first went into space...

687
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:21,270
ships from Earth would take months
to travel from one planet to another.

688
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,802
And travel between the stars,
hundreds of light years apart...

689
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,611
just was impossible.
Then we met the Centauri.

690
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:31,048
They gave us jumpgates,
which, of course, gave us hyperspace.

691
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,988
So instead of hundreds of years,
it now takes days or weeks...

692
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,684
to travel from one star to another.

693
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,227
That's old news. Fact is, the way I hear it...

694
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:41,695
the Centauris didn't exactly invent
jumpgate technology, either.

695
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,460
None of the current races did.

696
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,468
They found them when they got out
to space, took them apart...

697
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,003
and put them back together again.

698
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,096
No one even knows
who built the first gates...

699
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,233
but what does any of that have to do
with the artifact?

700
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,877
I think this is an original gate...

701
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,447
left behind by whatever ancient race
first came up with them.

702
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,246
But this one's different.

703
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,949
Maybe it was an experiment
that got away from them, I don't know.

704
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:10,425
But I do know that it doesn't open
into normal space or hyperspace.

705
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:15,328
I think it leads
to a totally different kind of space.

706
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:18,433
Call it a Thirdspace,
for lack of a better term.

707
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:22,202
And it works under
a whole different set of rules.

708
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,936
Now, if I'm right, travel in Thirdspace...

709
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,406
is even faster than hyperspace.

710
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,879
Where it took days or weeks
to travel from one star to another...

711
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,549
in Thirdspace, travel would be
almost instantaneous.

712
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,483
My God.

713
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,558
It would completely
revolutionize star travel.

714
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,355
It would open up
new avenues of commerce.

715
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,589
It would be one hell of a weapon.

716
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,857
No more hyperspace probes
giving you a two-day notice...

717
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,835
of approaching battle groups.

718
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,298
Whoever has Thirdspace capability...

719
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,041
can come in wherever,
whenever they want...

720
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,975
make the hit and get out
before anybody could react.

721
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,677
It is the ultimate form of commerce,
it is the ultimate weapon...

722
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,444
it's a twofer, Bill,
and it's just sitting right there...

723
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,919
waiting for us to figure it out.
And once we do figure it out...

724
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,389
all we have to do is figure out
where to put our Nobel Prizes.

725
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,853
That might explain what happened.
The signs of damage.

726
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,561
Whoever created it originally
might have intended...

727
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,599
to use it as a weapon
against another race.

728
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,692
Only, that race attacked
before it could be activated.

729
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:30,071
But that doesn't explain
how it got into hyperspace.

730
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,336
I mean, wouldn't they have wanted
to keep it for themselves?

731
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,673
It doesn't matter. It's ancient history.

732
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,475
What does matter is that
somebody's gonna figure out...

733
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,745
what we've got here,
and they'll try and take it away from us.

734
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:44,651
The only thing we can do is get in there,
crack this thing...

735
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,416
and get out before they do.

736
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,049
And the only way to do that
is to turn it on.

737
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,252
Assuming it still works after all this time.

738
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,590
It works. I can feel it.

739
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,094
Look, Bill, this is the big one.

740
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,466
It's gonna put us in the history books
for a thousand years.

741
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,071
Can I count on you?

742
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,367
Can I?

743
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,502
Okay.

744
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,881
Good. Let's get to work,
because we don't have a lot of time.

745
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:17,475
Right.

746
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,163
- Good afternoon, Commander.
- Hello, Vir.

747
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:36,697
I should tell you, only because it's a sign
of good luck among my people...

748
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,540
that I saw you in a dream last night.

749
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,668
- Did you?
- Yes. You and several other women...

750
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,110
but I don't think we need
to go into the details.

751
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,672
- Yeah, I suppose not.
- Boy, it was such a vivid dream.

752
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:53,449
And there was this city, you know,
this gorgeous place.

753
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,186
- A city?
- Yes.

754
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,891
- A big, black city?
- Yes.

755
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,856
With a big, black tower
about five miles high?

756
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,455
Yes, that's amazing.

757
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,033
Vir, do you remember
what happened to me?

758
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,568
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

759
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,336
- I wasn't going to mention that part.
- What?

760
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:19,106
You were killed.
Eaten, actually, by something.

761
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:23,015
I really didn't get a good look at it.
It was just...

762
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,345
That's all I remember.

763
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,752
- Ivanova to Sheridan.
- Sheridan. Go.

764
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,021
I think we have a problem
with the artifact.

765
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,160
Careful.

766
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,400
Five degrees to starboard.

767
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:41,963
Ease it on in.

768
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,833
C&C to work crew,
what are you doing out there?

769
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:49,400
The others modified an energy cell.
We're seeing if it works in the...

770
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,946
By whose authority?

771
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,512
Yours, I thought.

772
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,984
Negative. We never authorized this.
Break off immediately.

773
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,015
It's too late. We have contact.

774
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,871
Something's happening out there.

775
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,242
Com system's breaking up.

776
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,115
Get the hell out of there!

777
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,882
C&C, we have no power to the bay doors.

778
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:45,453
You are all in violation
of station ordinance 22B3A!

779
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,826
That means, get the hell out of here!

780
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,491
Hands off!

781
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,837
Engineering reports a 15% drop in power,
continuing to fall.

782
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,064
Yeah, the artifact.

783
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,835
They jump-started the thing
and now it's draining us dry.

784
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,103
- How many squadrons are out there?
- Just Delta.

785
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,805
- Get the rest outside.
- The power drain has shorted out...

786
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,644
the controls for the Cobra Bay doors.
They're working on it.

787
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,776
Tell them to hurry. At this rate,
pretty soon we won't be able...

788
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,184
to launch at all. Use 'em or lose 'em.

789
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,987
Do we have com systems?

790
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,687
Yes, but I don't know
how much longer they'll last.

791
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:21,559
Warning. Power loss.

792
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,692
We can't lose power to the tubes.
This place is too big to get around on foot.

793
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:29,534
Direct power to life support,
rotational systems, and transportation.

794
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,664
Sheridan. Go.

795
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,732
Captain, we got a problem
down in Cobra Bay 2.

796
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,244
People are trying to
keep the fighters from launching.

797
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,336
You need backup?

798
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,506
I called in the troops.
We can hold them here.

799
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,675
We got similar problems
all over the station.

800
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:45,517
It's all random violence,
they're trying to keep us off balance.

801
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:50,389
It's organized. Looks like they're under
some kind of telepathic influence.

802
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:55,230
I told my men to avoid killing anybody,
though I'm pretty tempted right now.

803
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,062
It's not their fault.
They're under outside control.

804
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,795
You can't kill them for that!

805
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,202
- At least, not yet!
- All right. Hang tight.

806
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:07,368
- Just keep them out of the bays.
- I'll do the best I can!

807
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,604
You get to Dr. Trent.
See what she has to do with this.

808
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,476
Maybe she knows what this thing is
and what it does.

809
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,314
I have the nasty feeling
that this is only a warm-up.

810
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:21,447
It's shut us down, it's immobilized us,
and now it's powering itself back up.

811
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,357
The question is,
what is it powering back up for?

812
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,818
I'm gonna see Lyta.

813
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:30,889
If that thing is putting out telepathic
impulses, she may be able to help.

814
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,425
Besides, it's got Vorlon writing all over it.

815
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:37,563
Know anyone that got closer
to the Vorlon than she did?

816
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,474
This is Security to all station personnel
and guests.

817
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,418
The situation has become
critically dangerous.

818
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,148
We are imposing immediate curfew
and lockdown.

819
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:57,852
Do not leave your quarters.
I repeat. For your own safety, stay inside.

820
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,155
Come on!

821
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:19,180
All right, we've got power. Go for launch.

822
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,021
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

823
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,927
Scanners indicate they're moving fighters
all around it.

824
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,637
- We've got to do something.
- Yes, we do.

825
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:54,611
All right, people, form up. Weapons hot.

826
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,017
We're to take that thing out without
getting close or it'll kill the engines.

827
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:02,785
- How close can we get?
- Just inside weapons range.

828
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,894
That far, and we won't even
be able to hurt it. The diffusion...

829
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,557
We have to keep hitting it and hope
our strikes have a cumulative effect.

830
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,930
Deltas 2 and 6, you'll be my wingmen.

831
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,027
3 and 9, hang back with the rest
and hit in the next wave.

832
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,230
Roger that.

833
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,170
Come on.

834
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,615
- Looks like you had the same idea.
- It seemed the logical choice.

835
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:39,722
Lyta, it's Delenn and John Sheridan.
We need to talk to you.

836
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,022
Lyta?

837
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,865
Security override.

838
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:55,374
Station alert. Lockdown in progress.

839
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,136
All civilian personnel,
please remain in your quarters.

840
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,616
- Lyta?
- We tried to stop it.

841
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,410
Tried to warn you.

842
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,483
We failed.

843
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,486
And now it is too late.

844
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,655
The door is opening.

845
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,932
- Negative on hit, Delta 7.
- Damn.

846
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,374
- Okay. Come around and we'll...
- Delta 7, the artifact...

847
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,250
Who are you?

848
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:46,383
An echo of what was. A memory.

849
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,024
A warning embedded in the thoughts
of each generation...

850
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,930
and passed on to the next.

851
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:56,396
We were exploring memories,
when the device was found.

852
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,706
That activated this memory...

853
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,138
this message.

854
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,770
Lyta once told me...

855
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:09,374
there might be some
leftover programming still inside her...

856
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:12,580
put there by the Vorlons
when they took off for the Rim.

857
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:15,114
This could be part of it.

858
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,716
Yes. A race memory.

859
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,327
Our great mistake.

860
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,258
Our failing.

861
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,761
And now your failing.
The error is compounded.

862
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,803
What mistake?

863
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:35,573
The first one,
the one from which all mistakes proceed.

864
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,771
The error of pride.

865
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,776
We had traveled to a thousand worlds.

866
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,012
We brought order, discipline.

867
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,814
We appeared to them as beings of light.

868
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:53,318
They saw us as emissaries
from the universe.

869
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,888
They saw us as gods.

870
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,131
And we, in our pride...

871
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,834
began to believe them.

872
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:06,603
We believed that we were superior
to the universe that gave us birth.

873
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,376
We believed we could
transcend this dimension...

874
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:13,006
that we belonged to another higher plane.

875
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:17,182
And in the end,
in terms you can understand...

876
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:21,186
we resolved to storm
the gates of Heaven itself.

877
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:25,151
We applied all our wisdom,
all our knowledge...

878
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,889
to opening a door to another dimension...

879
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:31,160
a place we believed
was the well of souls...

880
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,827
the foundation for all life.

881
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,672
We would touch the face of God...

882
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,205
and in so doing, become gods ourselves.

883
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:47,209
We forgot that a door
may swing in two directions.

884
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:51,444
We were so concerned with getting out
that we never stopped to consider...

885
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,718
what we might be letting in
until it was too late.

886
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,340
Holy...

887
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,514
What the hell is that?

888
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:39,063
They are a power beyond comprehension.

889
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,103
A hunger beyond understanding.

890
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,274
They are anti-life itself.

891
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,478
Older even than we were.

892
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,277
Telepathic, all of them.

893
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,774
They modified the gate...

894
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,945
so that it enhances
their telepathic impulses...

895
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:03,288
created an army of our own people
willing to die for them.

896
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:09,261
We fought them back,
disabled the device...

897
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:13,264
but those of us controlled
by their influence...

898
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,566
dropped it into hyperspace
before we could stop them.

899
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,398
Hid it from us.

900
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:25,343
- What do they want?
- To destroy all life that is not their own.

901
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:30,618
They believe only they have
the right to exist in the universe...

902
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:34,679
that all other life forms are inferior,
and must be exterminated.

903
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:39,760
In their own universe,
they have destroyed thousands of races...

904
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,854
and continue to destroy thousands more.

905
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,596
Because of our pride...

906
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,968
they know we are here.

907
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,371
They watch us
from within their dark cities...

908
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,874
waiting for the chance to come here...

909
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,845
and destroy.

910
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,309
Why can't they make a gate
from their side?

911
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,488
The door must be open on both sides.

912
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,559
Close this one,
and they cannot come through.

913
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,655
We've been searching for it for centuries...

914
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,533
hoping to find it and destroy it.

915
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,864
We feared this day would come.

916
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,333
They must be stopped...

917
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,807
or hundreds of worlds will die.

918
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,139
How?

919
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,880
Learn.

920
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,537
What is that? Some kind of field?

921
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,005
Doesn't matter.
We got a job to do, and we'll do it.

922
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,634
- Come around for another run.
- Roger that.

923
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,436
Break off!

924
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,411
- You sure you're all right?
- I think so.

925
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,410
You know what to do?

926
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:49,016
- You should take someone with you.
- I can't. I have to go alone.

927
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,184
You heard it... Her.

928
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:55,422
Now go on.
Do what you have to do. Go on.

929
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,440
Our mistake.

930
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:11,136
One of many. So many.

931
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,458
Dr. Trent?

932
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,666
There's so much going on
and everybody's acting so strangely.

933
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:38,103
- I just had to make sure it was you.
- What happened to him?

934
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,404
He saw your Starfuries
coming after the artifact...

935
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,411
and was going to interfere.

936
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,612
I think the device
took control of him somehow...

937
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,644
and I stopped him.

938
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:52,581
He came for me. I shot him.

939
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,487
There was no other way.

940
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,058
It's happening all over the station.

941
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,890
The device is using some kind of
a telepathic signal...

942
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,160
to control people, to use them
to keep us from shutting it down.

943
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,828
It seems they're doing a good job.
Listen, the Captain needs to know...

944
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,929
what you found out about the artifact,
anything that can help us.

945
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,497
Doesn't he have any ideas of his own?

946
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,941
- A few, but...
- I can't exactly advise you...

947
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,945
if I don't know what it is you want.

948
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,844
Well, I... Ivanova.

949
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,542
I'm on my way to Bay 9.

950
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,446
Scramble everybody you can.
Get them out.

951
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,488
Delenn's bringing in the Minbari Cruisers...

952
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,546
but I'll need you
to command the White Stars.

953
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,149
Me? What are you
gonna be doing when I'm...

954
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:34,089
Susan?

955
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,627
Stand by.

956
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,268
You said that you shot him
when he was coming towards you, right?

957
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,565
That's right.

958
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,466
Then why is the PPG burn
on the back of his jumpsuit...

959
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,238
and not the front?

960
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,587
Lvanova to C&C. Notify Security.

961
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:06,059
I need an arrest team
in Dr. Trent's office ASAP.

962
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,653
Confirmed.
There's something else, Commander.

963
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:12,596
We estimate two hours until
the energy drain leaves us dead in space.

964
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:16,860
Prepare all fighters for launch
and call in all the White Stars in the area.

965
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,406
We're going out there.

966
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,938
Repeat, hold position.
We've got reinforcements on the way.

967
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,673
They'd better get here soon.
I don't know what'll come out next...

968
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,683
but I'd bet good money
it's a hell of a lot bigger than we are.

969
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:53,172
Ivanova to Assault Fleet.
We're out. You're clear to proceed.

970
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,684
Remember, hold position.
Do not fire until ordered.

971
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,461
Don't take too long.
They're tearing the place apart in here.

972
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:32,543
Watch it! Look behind you!

973
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,467
Access confirmation required.

974
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,375
Sheridan, John J., Captain.

975
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:10,345
Password: Abraxas, 7-9-7-1-3.

976
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,280
Identity confirmed.

977
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,205
- Is everyone ready?
- Affirmative, Commander.

978
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,720
- Delenn, you set?
- Ready when you are.

979
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,283
- We'll wait for the Captain's signal.
- We may not have that much time.

980
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:05,738
Control to Assault Fleet, break and attack.
Target the front of the artifact.

981
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,934
I repeat, target the front
of the artifact only.

982
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,225
Hard to starboard! Fire!

983
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,023
- Stephen!
- Chief!

984
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:33,754
Go on! I'll catch up later!

985
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,560
- I thought I told everybody to stay in.
- You did, but we have wounded here.

986
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,361
- I can't just leave them.
- Yeah, I know.

987
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,459
Come on. Let me give you a hand.

988
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,938
- Put your arm around me.
- Here we go.

989
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,341
Watch it!

990
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,647
- Franklin to Medlab.
- I told you, com systems are down.

991
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,451
We can't move her.
We need a trauma team.

992
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,856
- What's going on?
- I don't know what you're saying.

993
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:07,622
- What are you doing outside?
- Don't do anything, all right?

994
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,995
- We need to move this girl to a medlab.
- I asked you a question.

995
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,591
- What's going on outside the station?
- What the...

996
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:16,899
Vir, don't make me do this.

997
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:31,183
- Maybe next time you'll listen!
- Yeah, if there's a next time!

998
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:37,152
Alpha 6 to Control,
we can barely hurt those things.

999
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,693
We have to hit them four times
before they even notice.

1000
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,730
- You'll have to be four times as accurate.
- We have to withdraw.

1001
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:45,994
Negative! This is the first wave
to soften us up for the main fleet.

1002
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,468
If we can't take these guys,
we can't take the rest. You keep at it.

1003
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:52,165
Defend yourselves,
continue to target the energy field...

1004
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,366
surrounding the artifact.

1005
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,932
Hit as much as you can and do not stop.

1006
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,391
I have got to be out of my mind.

1007
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:28,938
Sheridan to lvanova, I'm in position.

1008
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,936
- Go.
- Confirmed.

1009
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:32,343
Control to Assault Fleet.

1010
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:36,407
Anybody that has a clear shot
of that energy field, take it. Now.

1011
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,543
Entering artifact.

1012
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,012
Control to Delenn.

1013
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:12,776
- Yes?
- He's in.

1014
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:20,143
Thermonuclear
detonation sequence armed.

1015
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:36,027
- Delenn to Ivanova. Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you. What is it?

1016
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,825
Look at the artifact, Susan.

1017
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,332
Put it on screen.

1018
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,465
Give me a break.

1019
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:23,337
Flight system, retrace path.
Automatic navigation. Top speed.

1020
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:24,876
Confirmed.

1021
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:16,760
Sheridan to Assault Fleet. I'm clear.
Break off!

1022
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,760
All ships, break off!
Get the hell out of the way!

1023
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:12,918
Mission accomplished, Delenn. We got it.

1024
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:23,792
What are you doing?

1025
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:39,705
What am I doing here?
Why are you hitting me?

1026
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,474
I was just in the transport tube
with lvanova.

1027
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,596
Delenn to Assault Fleet.

1028
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:00,691
Escort all damaged ships to base,
and be careful.

1029
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,532
Some of the smaller enemy ships
may have survived.

1030
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,003
By the way, Delenn...

1031
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:07,906
- while you're making suggestions...
- Yes?

1032
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:10,569
...it looks like I used up
my last navigation pack...

1033
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,169
getting out of the artifact.

1034
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,908
Can you swing by and pick me up
on your way in?

1035
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,347
Of course.

1036
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:18,180
In the fullness of time.

1037
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:20,049
And how long is that?

1038
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:23,348
This isn't funny, Delenn.

1039
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:26,359
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1040
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,495
Station lockdown has been lifted...

1041
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:44,303
but the following areas are still off-limits
due to damage and debris.

1042
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,309
Grade 1, Grade 10...

1043
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,508
I'm sorry for what happened, Captain.

1044
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:51,614
It's not your fault.

1045
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:55,544
A lot of people fell under the influence
of that thing.

1046
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,725
More would've fallen
if we hadn't stopped it.

1047
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:00,624
However...

1048
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:05,224
that doesn't explain your decision
to hold back information...

1049
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,166
before that thing started broadcasting
telepathic signals.

1050
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:13,364
But we won't mention that part, will we?

1051
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:17,467
Make the conversation so depressing.

1052
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:19,669
Yes, it would.

1053
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,082
Bill should be alive right now.

1054
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:32,218
This is everything I have on the artifact.

1055
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,424
Maybe it'll be useful someday.

1056
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:37,294
Maybe not.

1057
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:39,756
What about you?

1058
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,963
I'm going to go away for a little while.

1059
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:50,339
After everything that's happened
I have to decide if I want this job anymore.

1060
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:55,312
I didn't like the part of me
that thing brought out.

1061
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:59,746
Maybe it's a learning experience for you.

1062
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:04,552
If it is, it's a hell of a painful one.

1063
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,588
Ain't no other kind, Dr. Trent.

1064
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,534
I was sure she didn't give me
all the information.

1065
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,403
She just wanted out of there.

1066
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:24,411
And if a little lie got her out the door,
that was fine with her.

1067
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:26,903
Fine with both of us, really...

1068
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:30,810
because, as Mr. Garibaldi
has been known to say from time to time:

1069
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:33,014
"We all lie."

1070
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,426
When the dust settled
and people wanted explanations...

1071
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,118
we gave them one.

1072
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:45,564
We said that the device was a weapon,
a mousetrap, which was true.

1073
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:48,661
We told them that it used
a telepathic trigger...

1074
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,897
and caused an outbreak of fighting.

1075
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:54,032
And we told them
that it was finally destroyed.

1076
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,309
It's all true.

1077
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:59,278
And of course, it's all a lie.

1078
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:04,509
Because there are times
we don't need the whole truth.

1079
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,748
The Vorlons made an error
thousands of years ago...

1080
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:10,313
and we paid the price for it today.

1081
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:13,355
Why encourage anyone else
to do the same?

1082
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:16,060
Hell, we've got more than enough trouble
of our own.

1083
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:19,224
We don't need to inherit
anyone else's mistakes.

1084
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:22,793
We got through it alive,
and everyone's okay.

1085
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,963
That's the important thing.

1086
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:29,472
And this isn't the kind of problem
that's likely to ever happen again.

1087
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,410
One mistake.

1088
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:37,473
One mistake out of so many.
So many others.

1089
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,129
