00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,048
{\an8}<i>was waged between Samaritan
and Nemesis.</i>

5
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,470
{\an8}<i>Twin brothers who became
sworn enemies.</i>

6
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>But let me start at the
beginning.</i>

7
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,934
{\an8}<i>They were freakishly strong.</i>

8
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,146
{\an8}<i>They unintentionally
hurt people.</i>

00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,610
{\an8}<i>The residents of the town</i>

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,278
{\an8}<i>grew to fear the brothers.</i>

11
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,866
{\an8}<i>They waited
until the family slept,</i>

12
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,451
{\an8}<i>boarded up their home,</i>

13
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,661

14

{\an8}<i>The parents were burned alive,</i>

15

16
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:27,713

{\an8}<i>Samaritan tried to contain
his brother's fury,</i>

21
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:44,104
{\an8}<i>so Nemesis forged
a powerful weapon.</i>

22
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,651
{\an8}<i>A hammer that he poured
all his hate and rage into.</i>

23
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,112
{\an8}<i>It was the only thing
that could destroy Samaritan.</i>

24
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,242
{\an8}<i>Nemesis lured him to the
power plant,</i>

00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,705

Man, Cyrus loves Nemesis.

Wanna be just like him.

134
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,215
We're going to Cyrus' place?

135
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,342
You didn't tell me
we were going to Cyrus' place.

[man 1] Yeah, you got a problem?

177
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,888
Come on, come on.

178
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,556
All right.

179
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,892
- You see him? Old guy?
- [Sam] Yeah.

180
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,036
Stop looking. Stop looking.

181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,371
We're just taking
the lotto tickets, right?

182
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,396
All right.

183
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,790
He's not gonna shoot you
over that, probably.

184
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,107
What do you mean, shoot?

185
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,316
You know what to do.

186
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,460
- Wait. No.
- [Reza] Come on.

187
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,568
[man1] Pow.

188
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,913
[coughing] Help!
Help, please!

189
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,832
Help! A car...

190
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,250
I don't need this shit.

191
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,584
[panting, grunting]

192
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,129
- [Sam] A car ran the light.
- [shopkeeper] What?

193
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,213
[Sam] Help! Please!

194
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,524
[Sam] Get the hell out of here.

195
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,608
This is none of my business.

196
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,509
{\an8}[Sam] I need your help.
I can't get up.

197
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,302
Come here.
What the hell is that?

198
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,846
[sniffs] Hot sauce!

199
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,472
- [Reza] Run, run!
- Goddamn thieves!

200
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,182
- [man 2] Let's go.
- [Sam] Go, go, go!

201
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,517
Goddamn sons of bitches.

202
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,603
[all laughing, cheering]

203
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,149
- [man] Okay!
- [Sam] Let's go!

204
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,025
[all laughing]

205
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,795
- [man 1] Open the box, open the box.
- [man 2] Yeah. Yes.

206
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,130
[Reza] There's some
serious value in there, cuz.

207
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,656
- And we can do that shit anytime.
- Anytime, huh?

208
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,967
What the hell's wrong with you?

209
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,151
[Reza] I told them to check
inside the boxes, cuz, I...

210
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,596
- You didn't look inside the boxes?
- Hey, chips is good though.

211
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,913
It was him.
Cuz, it was him, man.

212
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,433
- He took the wrong boxes.
- That didn't happen.

213
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,666
I did exactly what you said.

214
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,543
Are you calling me
a liar, bitch?

215
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,421
- [Sam grunts]
- [all exclaiming]

216
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,630
[Reza] Yeah, boy.

217
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:36,715
[all laughing]

218
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,508
[Cyrus] Are you a liar, Reza?

219
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,094
[laughter dies]

220
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,220
Nah, Cyrus.

221
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,279
How old are you, pal?

222
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,324
Thirteen.

223
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,659
Youngest and the smallest, huh?

224
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,871
Used to happen to me too.

225
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,291
That gets old.

226
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,793
Shit rolls downhill.

227
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,757
That's what's happening here?

228
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,431
Should be grateful.

229
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,475
The little man knows
when to keep his mouth shut.

230
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,809
Cyrus, that's bullshit.

231
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,144
Reza.

232
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,737
He likes you.

233
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,241
He likes people that got bite.

234
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,868
[chuckles]

235
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,288
I was scared as shit.

236
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,623
But you didn't rat.

237
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,208
That means something.

238
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,670
Yo! Come on.

239
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,673
Shit.

240
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,885
{\an8}[Cyrus] Big fan, huh?

241
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,972
Let me guess.

242
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,059
You like him
'cause he was the good guy.

243
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,146
Me...

244
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,777
I got a different perspective.

245
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,155
Nemesis hurt people.

246
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,074
Sometimes.

247
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,619
But it's not always if you hurt,
but who you hurt.

248
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,955
Nemesis always punched up.

249
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,707
I was about your age
when he died.

250
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,542
He was my hero.

251
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,043
Nemesis humbled the proud,

252
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,588
gave people a beating
who needed a beating.

253
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,216
To people around here,

254
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,136
Nemesis was a god.

255
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,430
Samaritan,

256
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,391
just another cop
to protect the rich

257
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,184
while the rest of us
went hungry.

258
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,774
For what you did today.

259
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,199
For what you'll do
for me in the future.

260
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,452
[bell tolling]

261
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,209
You do this every month.

262
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,129
And every month, I tell you
I get my check on the 5th.

263
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,297
Like, why do you do this?

264
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,649
Why do you
embarrass me like this?

265
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,008
- Mom...
- We got rules.

266
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,402
- Has my check not been there before?
- Mom.

267
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,486
- [man] Not on the first.
- Mom!

268
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,511
- Mom.
- No.

269
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,596
- Mom.
- No.

270
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,680
You enjoy doing this.

271
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,949
I'm not running a shelter here.

272
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,558
Take the damn money.

273
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,519
Here.
Open the goddamn door!

274
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,897
It's not personal.

275
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,651
Same shit every, every time.

276
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,569
Can't open it fast enough, huh?

277
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,405
Come on.

278
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,949
The nerve of this guy
locking me and my son out.

279
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,953
As soon as I get enough money,
I'm gonna quit this job,

280
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,307
we're gonna get on a bus,
and we're just gonna leave this city.

281
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,833
You will never have to deal
with that creep's face again.

282
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,210
- [water running]
- And go where?

283
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,170
I haven't figured that out yet.

284
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,131
What's that all over your face?

285
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,467
I went to the store,
and I slipped,

286
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,553
and I broke a shelf,
and I got sauce all over me and in my eye.

287
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,281
And the guy at the counter
gave me some money

288
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,057
so I wouldn't tell anybody
about it, okay?

289
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,479
What have I always told you?

290
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,314
Sam? What have I
always told you?

291
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,192
The decisions you make add up.

292
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,819
Exactly.

293
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,198
Where did you
get that money from?

294
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,875
Why didn't you ask me that
before you took it?

295
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,501
[sighs] Even if I'm not very good
at the job, I'm still your mother.

296
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,882
Ma.

297
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,976
[Cyrus] Good.
They're here.

298
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,547
The guy who led us to 'em said
they pack one hell of a punch.

299
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,568
Where'd you get 'em?

300
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,051
You know that army base
they're closing down outside of town?

301
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,990
We planted one of our guys
to the burial ordnance.

302
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,159
The things you bury
tend to haunt you.

303
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,493
Like a ghost.

304
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,039
- Oh!
- Boom!

305
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,250
[man] When are we gonna do this?

306
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,710
[Cyrus] Tomorrow.

307
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,882
[reporter on TV]

Hey! You thought
I was kidding?

316
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,003
I want the money you cost me.

What's that?

382
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,327
Nemesis.

383
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,294
It's here.

384
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,337
I feel its power.

385
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,022

what Nemesis started.

Wait, that thing is for real?

392
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,705
[Farshad] Of course, it's real.
You think he's messing around?

- I gotta talk to you.
- No, you don't.

- No, you didn't.

- Hi, kitty.
- [purring]

398
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,082
Seriously.
I found him.

399
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,917
Samaritan.

400
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,335
Yeah, you told me months ago.

401
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,920
The custodian
at your school, right?

402
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,296
No, not him.

403
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,423
Turns out, he was just
really strong for a janitor.

404
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:53,219
Or the mailman
who outran the bulldog, right?

405
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,179
A breed known for quickness.

406
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,391
That dog was so fast,
you gotta see him run.

407
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,351
Look, kid, I am
a serious journalist.

408
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,769
An intellectual.

409
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,022
I know. I respect
your work.

410
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,900
{\an8}Did you even buy my book?

411
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,529
Of course, I bought your book.

412
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,408
Okay.
I watch you online.

413
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,952
- Yeah.
- No, but...

414
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,205
I love your videos.
I watch them all the time.

415
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,665
Come on.

416
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,751
Look, kid, you can't just come in here
and harass me,

417
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,628
and scare away all my customers

418
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,792
every time you see an old man
make a sudden movement.

419
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,840
Get out.

420
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,842
But this time is different,
I'm telling you.

421
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,844
Look. I got ten bucks.

422
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,765
I'll buy one of your books,
if you just hear me out.

423
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,152
This is sweet.

424
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,242
Twenty years of blood, sweat,
and tears on these walls.

425
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,328
[pet food clatters]

426
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,204
[Sam] Whoa.

427
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,788
Hey, I actually...
I have something I wanna show you.

428
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,631
Now, you can't touch this.

429
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,884
Do not touch.

430
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,302
Just look.

431
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,849
Ten years ago, I had a friend who was
a custodian at the police impound.

432
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,225
He took this photo.

433
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,604
{\an8}That is a special
hand-forged hammer.

434
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,688
{\an8}It's a beauty.

435
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,106
Do you know where it was found?

436
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,191
No.

437
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,319
They found it at the death site.

438
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,363
Oh, wow.

439
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,574
Bet that hammer was forged from the hatred
that Nemesis had for his brother.

440
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,409
[searing]

441
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,706
And that that hammer
is the only thing

442
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,376
that could leave a scar
on either twin.

443
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,294
Now my theory is that Nemesis

444
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,338
started the fire
in that power station

445
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,966
because he wanted to throw
the whole city into anarchy and chaos.

446
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,251
And, of course, he wanted to
lure his brother into a trap.

447
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,684
But that plan went haywire.

448
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,482
Ultimately, it was his own hatred
that destroyed him.

449
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,608
Man.

450
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,902
Okay, let's get
to the main event.

451
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,030
Who is your Samaritan this time?

452
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,408
He's a garbage man.

453
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,427
<i>He lives in the apartment
building across from me.</i>

454
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,512
[Casler] <i>That's convenient.</i>

455
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,163
[Sam] <i>Look, this time</i>
<i>is really different.</i>

456
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,333
He beat up these kids
that always bully me.

457
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,001
He beats up children?

458
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,171
No, no. Like, older kids.
Like, gang kids.

459
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,465
He has this big,
nasty scar on his back.

460
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,259
Exactly like he was in a fire.

461
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,886
And how did you see this scar?

462
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,556
I can see him in his window.

463
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,599
Okay, I don't know
what's more concerning here,

464
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,494
that you think Samaritan
lives across from you,

465
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,645
or that you're peeking
in the windows of old men.

466
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,398
No, no, no.
It's not like that at all.

467
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,900
Look, kid, you've said your piece,
that's ten dollars' worth.

468
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,402
Okay, just wait
one second, okay?

469
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,486
Let me grab something.

470
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,152
Let's go, grab your stuff.

471
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,614
Look.

472
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,660
He did this.
Just by grabbing it.

473
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,704
With his bare hands?

474
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,831
How cool is that?

475
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,686
How do you know
the knife wasn't like this

476
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,030
before the garbage man
grabbed it?

477
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,921
I saw him do it.

478
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,759
Oh, kid.

479
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,821
You're gonna need more than
a horrifically scarred old man,

480
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:23,929
and a bent knife, Tim.

481
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,473
Sam.

482
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:26,974
Close enough.
Grab your stuff.

483
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,579
I see you up there, a-hole.

484
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,544

488
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:51,976
Whoa.

491
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,305
What?

492
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,062
"Samaritan
saves the day."

493
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,564
Samaritan.

494
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,858
[chuckles]

495
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:52,786
[Farshad] You understand what it makes me
look like, when my cousin lies to Cyrus?

496
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,705
It looks bad.

497
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,708
I vouched for you.

498
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,561
- Farshad, what do you want me to say?
- Nothing.

499
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,961
Just stop talking.

500
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,588
Yo.

501
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,799
That's him.

502
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,260
That's that old man.

503
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,779
[Tuna chuckling]
That's the old man that beat you up?

504
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,573
[Reza] Tuna, you go try him.
He'll beat your dumb ass, too.

505
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,806
That's him.

506
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,375

Sam?

509
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,637
Sam. Come here.

<i>Sam!</i>

512
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,903
What, Ma?
What are you doing?

513
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,488
[Tiffany] What do you mean,
"What?"

514
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,115
I thought we could have dinner.

515
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:12,950
I...

516
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,410
- What happened there?
- That?

517
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,829
I ran into a locker.

518
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,706
A locker? Does that locker
have a name?

519
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,417
What? [chuckles] No.

520
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,793
Just a locker.

[banging on door]

522
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,093
Yes?

523
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,928
Your kid took
something valuable of mine.

524
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,515
What?
Who are you?

525
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,600
Joe Smith.
I live over there.

526
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,935
What did he take?

527
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,061
My scrapbook.

528
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,274
Sam. Get over here.

529
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,077
You have something
that belongs to this man?

530
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,992
Let's have it.

531
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:56,994
Apologize.

532
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,996
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,539
Is that all you have to say?

534
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,623
I don't know.

535
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,584
I'm a fan?

536
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,879
What is wrong with you?

537
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,756
What is that even
supposed to mean?

538
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:09,923
Wait.

539
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,427
Could I ask you for a favor?

540
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,262
He's a good kid.
He really is.

541
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,139
So please,
don't call the police.

542
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,767
He won't do this again,
I promise.

543
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,603
[sighs] And this is not
an excuse.

544
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,355
His father...

545
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,732
Look, he's changed.

546
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,776
And you can blame me.
It's just...

547
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,360
He's good.
He's just a little

548
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,196
lost.

549
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,576
No harm done.

550
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,330
You have a good mother.

551
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,499
Lucky.

552
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,334
Very lucky.

[Sam grunts, groans]

557
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,481
I've already checked out
that dumpster.

558
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,149
Not much in it.

559
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,570
You know, I wasn't gonna
keep the album.

560
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,781
I just thought you were him.

561
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,742
That's all right. You know,
I used to steal some stuff, too.

562
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,119
But who did you think I was?

563
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,165
Him?

564
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,375
Yeah.

565
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,876
Samaritan's dead.

566
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,753
That's what they say.

567
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:32,339
Yeah. I just pick up garbage
for a living. That's what I do.

568
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,384
Don't punch me in my face
if I don't agree with you.

569
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,012
I would never
punch you. What?

570
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,682
Why do you have that scrapbook?

571
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,477
Because I'm a fan. Like you.

572
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,145
That's it.

573
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,773
So, why don't you go play
football or whatever you do,

574
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:53,151
because all this questioning is
just starting to get on my nerves now.

575
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,612
Calling me this person
and calling me that.

576
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,698
You mind your business, I'll
mind mine.

577
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,074
You're a liar!

578
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,450
I don't believe you!

579
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,994
Listen, kid...

580
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,162
Oh, we got him.

581
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:09,877
Oh, he's out. He's out.

582

Oh, my God.

587

Oh, my God!
I knew you were him!

601
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,767
I knew it!

602
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,143
I knew it!

603
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,442
- Come on.
- [Joe grunts]

604
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,277
I knew it was you this whole
time.

605
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,987
I need water.

606
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,656
I knew it, everybody!

607
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,866
- Hold it down.
- Okay.

608
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,159
- Water.
- Okay. All right.

609
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,953
Okay, go.

610
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,412
Get lost. You're bad luck.

611
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,082
No way. This is the best day
ever.

612
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,166
For you!

613
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,210

00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,671
Heaven!

[exclaiming]

617
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,595
I can't believe I found
Samaritan.

618
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,930
Wrong.

619
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,599
You're just a dude
who gets hit by a car,

620
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:48,809
gets his bones broken,

621
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,268
and eats mad ice cream.

622
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,772
I eat this stuff
to cool my body down.

623
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,524
Why don't you just drink some
ice water?

624
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,359
I don't like the taste.

625
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,655
-Can I have some? No. undefined
-undefined

626
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,408
Sorry. I need it for
emergencies.

627
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,078
Why were you steaming?

628
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,707
You know anything about binary fission,
cellular thermodynamics?

629
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,126
What? I'm 13 years old.

630
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,461
You know what happens during a
heat stroke?

631
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,839
When I get hurt, my body
overheats,

632
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,924
and if I don't cool it down,

633
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,802
my heart explodes.

634
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,138
That is not human.

635
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,391
Wait. Is this how it was for
Nemesis?

636
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,394
You guys were brothers, right?

637
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,897
Enough with the Nemesis stuff.

638
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,441
Why don't you go have some ice
cream?

639
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,026
Thanks.

640
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,035
You saved my dad once.

641
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,203
Where do you come up with this
stuff?

642
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,330
Have you ever looked up
the word "delusional,"

643
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,624
because that's what you are.
You're delusional.

644
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,418
I'm not delusional.
I'm serious.

645
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,003
You saved my dad.

646
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,171
He used to boost cars.

647
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,007
You caught him one night.

648
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,676
And instead of busting him,
you talked to him.

649
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,636
What'd he do,
write fairytales for a living?

650
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,305
No, he died.

651
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,563
Let's see if we can wake these
people up.

beat the crap out of you.

in a cave. See, I'm a caveman.

711
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,004
I live in a tiny apartment, and
it's fine.

712
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,673
I'm good with it. I like being
alone.

713
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:56,426
You know what bothers me?
What really depresses me?

714
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:00,263
Being around other people.

715
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:01,765
Follow me?

716
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,224
No.

717
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,809
-Sure, you do.No. undefined
-undefined

718
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,561
That doesn't make any sense.

719
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,605
You save people. That's not a
loner.

720
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,607
Smells like bullshit to me.

721
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,404
You got big balls.
I'll give you that.

722
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,507
[Sam] So, how much do you think
you're gonna get off the camera?

723
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,532
I don't know.

724
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,493
10 bucks, 20 bucks?

725
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,162
God, what are you,
an accountant or something?

726
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,165
Do me a favor,
stay here while I go in there.

727
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,249
Still want me to come in?

728
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,710
No, yeah. That's why I said,
"Wait here."

729
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:31,795
Hey!

730
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,881
What are you looking at?

731
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,050
[Joe growls]

732
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:41,763
[sighs]

733
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,725
Sorry.

734
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,731
What? You just let that happen?

735
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:53,900
Should've thrown him
over a tree or something.

736
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,696
I'm disappointed.

737
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:03,910
[Joe] Stay out.

738
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,998
What the hell did you do?

739
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,668
Just snapped off. It's falling
apart, like both of us.

740
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,545
Yeah, well, speak for yourself.

741
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,966
This is solid brass.

742
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,468
I know. But even brass gets
tired.

743
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,862
[Arthur] I'm taking this
out of your account.

744
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:22,887
[Joe] That's fair enough.

745
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:26,266
[Arthur] Another Sunday,
another piece of junk.

746
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,685
- Give you $25.
- Whoa. Really?

747
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:29,811
Here we go again.

748
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:30,895
It's not a Canon.

749
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,982
How about $50
and I take your picture with it?

750
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,151
- [Arthur laughs]
- Okay.

751
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,735
[alarm ringing]

752
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,737
[burglars laughing]

753
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,674
- [car honking]
- Hey, come on! What are you doing?

754
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,217
- Stop! Thief!
- [Joe] Look at this. See?

755
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,452
This is what happens when you
let

756
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,371
a couple of genetic freaks
try to fix your city.

757
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,665
People gotta
get rid of their own problems,

758
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,294
or their problems
gonna get rid of them, right?

759
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,628
Right.

760
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,422
How many bad guys did you fight
at once?

761
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,840
100.

762
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,425
Wow.

763
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,719
How strong are you?

764
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,846
I'm still pretty strong.
You saw that.

765
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,390
But not like I once was.

766
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,768
Things start to fall apart when
you stop caring, and I stopped caring

767
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,813
a long time ago.

768
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,315
[Sam] <i>How far can you jump?</i>

769
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,734
Then, maybe over 10 cars.

770
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,402
Now, nine.

771
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,446
No way. Let's see you do it.

772
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,491
No, forget it. I'm not gonna
wreck my knees entertaining you.

773
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,869
Have you ever had to jump off a
building?

774
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,246
No, but I've thrown
a lot of people off 'em.

775
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,748
I'm just kidding.

776
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,708
Man, I've told you too much.

777
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,337
You can trust me.

778
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,671
You should know that.

779
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:54,938
You ever get scared?

780
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,733
Why? Are you scared of
something?

781
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,449
- Just...
- Sure, I get scared.

782
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,077
Come on. Everybody does.

783
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,287
Fear, that's natural.

784
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,581
But you'd still fight.

785
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,250
Yeah, when necessary.

786
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,794
But I don't want to. I don't
like it.

787
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,882
When I get scared, the first
thing I think about is running.

788
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:25,093
And I always freeze up.

789
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,595
Hey. Come here.

790
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,224
That's the smart thing to do.

791
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,977
Street fighting is for fools.

792
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,646
Why would you wanna get into a
fight with some stranger

793
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,398
who has nothing to do with your
life,

794
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:40,942
who could take your life?

795
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,490
What you're doing is right,
okay?

796
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,329
You better get going
before your mother calls the cops.

797
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,707
All right. Good night, Joe.

798
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:57,625
Sam.

799
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,295
Let me see your watch.

800
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:17,687
I'll try.

801
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,813
But no promises.

802
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:21,524
Thanks, Joe.

803
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,984
You're welcome.

Well, funny you say that.

lucky?

Why you like working
on all this old junk so much?

See? Breaking things
comes easy.

884

Now, fixing them,
that helps me relax and focus,

885

things deserve a second chance.

1238
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,251
Yeah. Yeah.

1239
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,340
Samaritan.

1240
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,135
Welcome, good guy.

1241
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,386
You came.

1242
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,890
You really came.

1243
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:47,603
I never saw Samaritan care so much
about anyone in my part of town before.

1244
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:52,859
Let him go.

1245
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,993
And we'll do this, you and me.

1246

[scoffs, grunts]

1247
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,831
No.

1248
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,543
I want him
to watch his hero fall.

1249
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,297
To see what everyone
should know,

1250
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,133
that you're a fake.

1251
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:26,684
No one can help you
but yourself, good guy.

fall, Sam.

1265

How we all felt!

1274
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:41,259
You keep calling me
the "good guy."

1275
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,723
I'm not the good guy.

[Samaritan screams]

1277
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,442
I'm the bad guy!

Nemesis?

Yeah.

stayed buried, old man.

Look at you.
You're weak. You're pathetic!

you never could, your plan.

The power station, the grid,

Look at your hero.

1346
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:07,681
He betrayed you, Sam.

1347
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:09,141
He betrayed everyone.

1348
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:14,313
But no one betrays me!

1349
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,735

1371
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,370
[Joe] Thanks, kid.

1372
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:00,330
That's

1373
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:02,875
some sucker punch.

1374
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:07,421
Come on, Joe, let's get up.

1375
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:08,505
Yeah.

1376
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,133
I got you.

1377
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,013
Come on.

1378
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,150
All right.
Don't be afraid.

1379
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:29,902
We got this.

1380
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,236
Wait, what?

1381
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:37,117
Oh, my...

No!

[Sam grunts, coughs]

1384
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:54,593
[Joe] That hurt.

1385
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,598
Holy shit.

1386
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,226
Come on, dude.

1387
01:32:03,477 --> 01:32:05,062
Man, we gotta get outta here.

1388
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:06,271
Come on.

1389
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,566
You got it. Let's go.

1390
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:11,902
Is it true?

1391
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:14,279
- There's people coming, let's go...
- Is it true?

1392
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,367
What, that I'm him?

1393
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:21,536
Yeah, it's true.

1394
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:24,998
You can fix that.

1395
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:28,460
I've seen you fix things before.

1396
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,545
You can change.

1397
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:36,510
Kid, let me tell you something.

1398
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:41,098
If there was only bad people
doing bad things,

1399
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:42,933
it'd be easy to get rid of 'em.

1400
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:46,228
But the real truth is,

1401
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:50,816
good and bad live in
everybody's heart.

1402
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:56,363
And it's gonna be up to you
to make the right choice.

1403
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,826
And I know you will.

1404
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,789

Fourth floor.

1405
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:10,002
All right, let's go.

[sirens wailing in distance]

1407
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:27,704
[reporter] Protestors here
witnessed

1408
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:30,647
this building behind me
going up in flames.

1409
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:34,109
A figure, who some think
may have been Samaritan,

1410
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,861
carried a young boy to safety.

1411
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,047
We're hearing some cheers right now.
It's the boy. Let's go.

1412
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:40,198
Shut up! Nemesis!

1413
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,367
Hey, kid.
What's your name?

1414
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:44,369
It's Sam.
His name is Sam.

1415
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,413
You were right, Sam.

1416
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:49,624
Well, Sam, can you answer the question
that everyone has been asking?

1417
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,418
Yes, Samaritan lives.

1418
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:53,211
You're certain
that it's really him?

1419
01:33:54,046 --> 01:33:57,090
Man, it was hot in there.
