    (Skateboard scratching)

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,599
  Legend has it, that when the
         moon's full...

3
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,169
   ...you can still spot ole
          Pitchfork...

4
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,472
    ...wandering the woods.

5
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,383
 Young Corey: My dad says we're
    not suppose to play back
            here...

6
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,385
   ...He says a monster lives
             here.

7
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,396
              Run!

8
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,629
  You shoulda seen your face.

9
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,465
  Wincer: It's the worst thing
        I've ever seen.

10
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,826
 There's a legend around here,
that a farmer killed his family.

11
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:08,046
    Morgan: If you mess with
  Rayborn's daughter, you mess
      with the pitchfork.

12
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,554
  This is right outside of out
           perimeter.

13
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,989
Does anybody live out this way?

14
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,889
       I don't think so.

15
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,164
            (Cheers)

00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,844

           (Screams)

18
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,132
         Run! Run! Run!

19
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,414
            No! No!

20
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,382
        (Scream in pain)

21
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,550
     Who the hell is that?

22
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,022
      I know who that is.

23
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,579
             Sorry.

24
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,745
        (Radio chatter)

25
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,259
   This shit doesn't happen.

26
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:50,569
  I mean we caught the fucking
    Boogie Man, or Dracula,
  or hell, the devil himself.

27
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,673
You understand what I'm saying?
 - Yeah, you guys grow 'em big,
   and you grow 'em crazy...

28
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,640
      I'll give you that.

29
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,176
   Nah, it's more than that.

30
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:04,115
 Did you ever play that Bloody
 Mary game when you were kids?

31
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,985
 What where you stare into the
    mirror and say her name?

32
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,353
             Yeah.

33
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,621
          Yeah, sure.

34
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,191
 Did she ever come to life and
    start murdering people?

35
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,497
      I'm not trying to be
     insensitive, I'm not.

36
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,798
       It's just that...

37
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,568
when we was kids, growing up...

38
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,505
       He's the reason we
    didn't playin the woods.

39
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,075
       Those stories you
       tell each other...

40
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,644
  trying to keep each other up
    late at night at camp...

41
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,380
        were about him.
     - When you were a kid?

42
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:39,217
             Yeah.
  - Dang. That dude looks good
      for like, a hundred.

43
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,619
              Ha!

44
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,122
 I might have been a teenager,
     but you get my point.

45
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,558
  Why were you still going to
      camp as a teenager?

46
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,694
 It was vacation bible school.

47
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,831
       That's not weird!

48
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:03,375
    You know I saw him once,
      or I thought I did.

49
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,713
      We were working late
       on Christmas Eve.

50
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,584
     Car wreck, completely
      engulfed in flames.

51
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,586
      Couple lost control.

52
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,323
    Well it just felt weird.

53
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,694
   I don't know if it was the
      wind or the cold...

54
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,730
  or it was Christmas Eve and
I just didn't want to be there.

55
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,507
    (On Radio): Hey Wincer,
         what you got?

56
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,112
     I didn't really think
        about it then...

57
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,848
      but on the way home,
       from the scene...

58
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,619
       I passed right by
     the old Rayborn place.

59
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,656
 Well, I wouldn't have admitted
   then, but I'll tell you...

60
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,959
  scared the shit out of me...

61
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,394
    that some fucking crazy,
           old hermit

62
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:00,398
would've been that close to me,
    in the dark, at night...

63
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,168
   well, it'd scare anybody.

64
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,304
   Was Rayborn his real name?

65
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,773
             Yeah.

66
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,711
 'Til they started calling him
           Pitchfork.

67
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,088
Hey, if they can keep him alive,
  you're gonna need to put...

68
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,056
 ...a small army on his floor.

69
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,658
         Yeah, no shit.

70
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,627
Yeah, media's gonna be a bitch.

71
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,629
      I thought you meant
        if he wakes up.

72
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,232
  I don't believe in monsters.

73
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,003
             Fuck!

74
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,208
          (Screaming)

75
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,217
          (Screaming)

76
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,930
           (Grunting)

77
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,396
       Morgan: Let me ask
        you something...

78
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,865
     what do you think the
   chances are that Steven...

79
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,368
      would come work with
     us down on the boats?

80
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,569
            (Laughs)

81
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,571
   Well, let's see after you
        sold half our...

82
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,573
      ...gear to send him
        off to college.

83
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,608
Yeah. Does he have to know that?

84
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,814
  Morgan: It's good to see you
   boys back together again.

85
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,218
       You know I'd sell
     everything I own if...

86
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
     I thought there was a
       chance in hell...

87
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,689
   you'd wise up and get the
       hell out of here.

88
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,192
     Bring it on, alright.
         Alright buddy.

89
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,935
  (Whispering) They said like
  25 dead, including his dad.

90
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,838
  Oh my God. That's terrible.

91
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,108
       Make sure you give
     that to Dr. Shapiro...

92
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,010
      he needs it as soon
      as you can. Thanks.

93
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:35,787

95
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,111
             (Sobs)

96
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,337
  Steven hasn't come out yet?

97
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,039
            Not yet.

98
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,676
         He'll be fine.

99
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,083
  We use to play pretty rough
    when we were kids, so...

100
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,719
          he knows how
       to take a beating.

101
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,657
            (Laughs)

102
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:59,898
     I saw him tear up from
        a splinter once.

103
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:09,908
               ¶

104
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,911
    Tiburon: It's called the
       Day of the Dead...

105
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:17,315
    (Speaking spanish), it's
     a time to remember...

106
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,350
 those that we've lost, and...

107
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,853
     the ones who have gone
         on before us.

108
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,521
    I've seen that on TV and
             stuff

109
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,823
 it's like a scary Mardi Gras,
             right?

110
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,963
       Yeah, pretty much.

111
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,868
            (Laughs)

112
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,503
      They didn't let you
       have the day off?

113
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,172
         I did not ask.

114
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,742
     Man, if I was Mexican,
  I wouldn't be working zombie
          Mardi Gras.

115
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,047
You know, that is disrespectful.

116
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:55,453
It's a celebration of a passing
 soul and to remind us that...

117
00:15:55,455 --> 00:16:00,858
   life is just a dream, and
     death is when we wake.

118
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,195
       That's beautiful.

119
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,599
           Thank you.

120
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,736
   But, you have parades and
     throw candy too right?

121
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,438
       That's Mardi Gras.

122
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,440
        Woah woah, hey!

123
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,241
             Yeah?

124
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,309
        Where ya headed?

125
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,311
    Second floor, what's up?

126
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,612
         Is it urgent?

127
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,881
       Man, I'm at work!

128
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,952
      You got a minute to
        conference call?

129
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,455
 Didn't your ass just go smoke?

130
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,757
        Maybe, slow day.

131
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,828
You know, one of these days they
  gon' catch on to the fact...

132
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,130
    that you don't do shit!

133
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:42,133
            (Laughs)
      Yeah. Maybe, maybe.

134
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:46,371
Alright man, you twisted my arm.
    Yo Tiburon, you coming?

135
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,008
    Oh no, I get to get back
      to these checklists.

136
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,643
      Alright well, don't
      work too hard, man.

137
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,079
         He won't, it's
      mexican Mardi Gras.

138
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,382
            No shit?
       - I shit you not.

139
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,384
            Gringos.

140
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:05,957
           (Laughing)

141
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,925
   Mardi Gras, Cinco de Mayo,
      they got everything.

142
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,228
   Hey man look, who was that
    they brought in earlier?

143
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,897
    I don't know. They came
      in through the back.

144
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,866
       Through the morgue
        entrance right?

145
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,533
             Yeah.

146
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,567
              Why?

147
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,436
         I don't know.

148
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,239
  They did that shit that last
 time the mayor got his DUI...

149
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,241
         snuck his ass
      through the back...

150
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,343
    like I wasn't suppose to
       know who he is...

151
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,245
      shit, I know who the
      fuck he is. Ah Shit!

152
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,179
             What?

153
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,280
 Man, I gotta go back to the...

154
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,615
   break room, get my smokes.

155
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,116
    I'll bum you one, c'mon.

156
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:36,254
          Hell no man!
         You smoke that
      nasty menthol crap.

157
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,623
              So?
             - So?!

158
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,493
Dude that's full of fiberglass.
        That shit's way
       worse for you man.

159
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,564
    Oh. So it's more deadly
       than just smoking?
             Idiot.

160
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,682
          (Door Slams)
            (Grunts)

161
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,855
       (Noise continues)

162
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,778
             Shit.

163
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,120
         (Violent thud)

164
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,708
           Oh, sorry.
          - It's okay.

165
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,382
           You okay?

166
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,087
      Said might have some
        nerve damage...

167
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:17,889
      physical therapy...

168
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:23,694
          It'll be ok.
        Baby, baby, it's
         fine, really.

169
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,063
        Said it could've
        been alot worse.

170
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,267
       Has anyone checked
          you out yet?

171
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,836
          Not really.

172
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,506
       They want to check
      for a heartbeat, so.

173
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,242
   Did they do your CAT scan?

174
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,144
          No, not yet.

175
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,246
        Checking you for
        "dain bramage?"

176
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:45,316
            (Laughs)
      New "dain bramage."

177
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,987
     Have you..had a chance
     to talk to anyone yet?

178
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,924
         No, I gotta...

179
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,160
          go down and
      identify the... umm.

180
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,872
            Amanda?

181
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,146
  They towed that truck out of
    here about an hour ago.

182
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,682
 You know a bunch of kids head
  out here for some thrills...

183
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,717
       and end up in this
    crazy fucking nightmare.

184
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,488
 Whole thing turns my stomach.
      - You see that poor
     bastard in the woods?

185
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,390
        With the fucking
       thing on his face?
            - Yeah.

186
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,659
       Yeah, I saw it...

187
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,695
  I don't fucking believe it.

188
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,230
       I mean honestly...

189
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,131
       have you ever seen
      anything like this?

190
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,303
     Man, there ain't ever
    been anything like this.

191
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,343
          Lt. Dayton?

192
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,578
             Yeah?

193
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,749
    The city guys posted at
       the hospital said
 the ambulance isn't there yet.

194
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,652
You sure? They told everyone to
  else use the back entrance.

195
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,721
        He said they're
      covering both sides.

196
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,923
      They never made it.

197
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,595
    Ole Wincer could fuck up
 a cup of coffee, couldn't he?

198
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,664
  I'll tell you what, you tell
      them to stay put...

199
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,732
   in case they radio in, you
     follow me up the nine,
 see if we can chase them down.

200
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,735
     'Til we locate Wincer
    everyone reports to me.

201
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,934
       Wasn't sure if you
     were a coffee drinker.

202
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,736
      Only if it's Irish.

203
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,206
            Thanks.

204
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,515
          You know...

205
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,885
  I remember you from school.

206
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,120
           Fairhope?

207
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,059
          Go Pirates.

208
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,531
 Yeah, you were a couple grades
     ahead of me, but I...

209
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,499
        I saw you in the
        halls and stuff.

210
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,568
  You were in Steven's grade.

211
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,469
             Yeah.

212
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:24,275
      I didn't know him or
      anything, I just...

213
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,145
    Small school, you know?

214
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,215
          Yeah, tiny.

215
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:38,155
   You...you left before the
   year was over, didn't you?

216
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,596
  I'm not a stalker I promise,
              I...

217
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,598
          I just, uh.

218
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,737
  Yeah, I dropped out to help
      my dad on his boat.

219
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,805
       He was gonna lose
        it to the bank.

220
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,177
           I never...

221
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,316
             So...

222
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,353
     your dad, I mean he...

223
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,190
             Yeah.

224
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,796
              I...

225
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,632
          I wasn't...

226
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,936
           I'm sorry.

227
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,441
      I wasn't even there.

228
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,047
 Do you want to talk about it?

229
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,318
      I just want answers.

230
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:46,090
   The police are telling us
     two different things.

231
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,593
   It doesn't make any sense.

232
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:58,369
          You know...

233
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,105
      I've been here for a
      couple of years now.

234
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:06,277
     And I've seen alot of
   people dealing with loss.

235
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,978
             But...

236
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,816
    nothing quite like this.

237
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,621
 Whenever there's a tragedy...

238
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:25,830
      It's always so hard
       on the survivors.

239
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,335
        And I don't just
       mean the families.

240
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,239
       I mean the people
      who were involved...

241
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,010
      who could've just as
      easily not made it.

242
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:52,189
   Not only do you have this
     pain and loss, but...

243
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,795
      but you can get a...

244
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,598
   guilt that comes with it.

245
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,272
  Sometimes it's hard to find.

246
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,261
  It's hard to be a survivor.

247
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,835
    It starts to feel easier
       just to give up...

248
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,741
    but you can't, you know?

249
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,779
Mary: You have to keep fighting.

250
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,383
     (Heartbeat on monitor)
          There it is.

251
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,859
   Sounds really strong too.

252
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,029
  I'll give you two a minute.

253
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,138
 I don't mean to be intrusive.

254
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,541
   No, my dad would have told
     me to suck it up too.

255
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:23,147
    That's not exactly what
         I was saying.

256
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,782
            I know.

257
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,784
         (Phone rings)

258
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,555
    I have to deal with the
 families that come in here...

259
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,591
      all the time and...

260
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,428
    it's never easy for the
       one that made it.

261
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:45,135
   (Phone ringing continues)

262
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,272
     If you need anyone to
     talk to or anything...

263
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,642
        I work until 10.

264
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,314
            Thanks.

265
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,352
   (Phone ringing continues)

266
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:17,501
        Hi, front desk.

267
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,505
     Down in the archives?

268
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,942
      Ok, sure, what file?

269
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,346
     Ok, yeah it'll just be
      a couple of minutes.

270
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,051
   On TV: Hey boys and girls,
      it's Captain Morgan.

271
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,853
  And you know what, it's that
      time of year for...

272
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,922
        Captain Morgan's
        Haunted Hayride.

273
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,425
 We got werewolves, we got ...

274
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,427
    zombies, we got headless
     people running all...

275
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,695
         we got it all!

276
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,866
So, come on down Friday the 30th
    and Saturday the 31st...

277
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,702
 that's Halloween night and if
     you're brave enough...

278
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:55,005
     to ride in our ride of
     terror and survive...

279
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,175
  well then you might just get
       to meet Pitchfork.

280
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,044
      Pitchfork, himself!

281
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,147
 Make sure you bring the kids!

282
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,182
      (Laughs maniacally)

283
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,751
            No! No!

284
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,923
       (Screams in agony)

285
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,293
          Feel better?

286
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,862
          Not really.

287
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,665
    I mean, about the baby,
       little Steven, Jr.

288
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:37,234
         You mean Lily.

289
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,236
             Lily?!

290
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,804
   Yeah, you don't like Lily?

291
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,472
        I really don't.

292
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,242
       This is gonna be a
       problem isn't it?

293
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,177
   I can almost guarantee it.

294
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,484
 We're not naming our son Lily.

295
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,386
          (Both laugh)

296
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:01,491
     Sorry Mr. Summers, the
    doctor will see you now.

297
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,903
           Love you.
        - Love you too.

298
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,003
    (Metal door swings open)

299
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,127
      (Screams) Oh my god!
        - Sorry, sorry.
   Oh, my god! You scared me.

300
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:41,831
     Yeah...I thought I was
      going the wrong way.

301
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,100
        Where ya headed?

302
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,368
         Waiting room.
  - No, that's the right way.
 Everything just looks kinda...

303
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,638
        messed up cause
      they're remodeling.

304
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,709
  Tax dollars at work I guess.
   - Alright, thanks...sorry.

305
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:02,452
        (Muffled shriek)

306
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,564
           (Screams)

307
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,821
              Hey!

308
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,222
             Corey!

309
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,224
       Hey, put her down!

310
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,226
            Rayborn!

311
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,192
Security Guard: Drop the knife!

312
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,795
        Drop the knife!

313
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,699
       Drop the knife you
     motherfucker drop it!

314
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,906
           (Gunshots)

315
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:53,423
   Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
   to stay back, let's go...

316
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:57,627
  come on, nothing to see down
    here, let's go, come on.

317
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,542
Sir get back in the waiting room
 until we've secured the area.

318
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,112
        Corey. That's my
        fucking brother!

319
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,985
         Are you okay?

320
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:26,723
        I tried Steven.
            - Tried?

321
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,529
        Where's Amanda?

322
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,568
      Alright, I know you
        boys are tired.

323
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,740
 It's been a long fucking day.
      Some of you been on
       24 hours already.

324
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,578
 ER Doctor: Ok, what do we got?

325
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,147
45 year old male, unresponsive,
    motor vehicle accident.

326
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,518
    But, I don't wanna hear
    about that right now...

327
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,656
 and I don't want to hear about
   the Boogeyman, monsters...

328
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:01,691
    or spook stories either.

329
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,196
  Local legends, no matter how
 many times we've heard them...

330
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:08,231
    are still just legends.

331
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:26,683
What I need you concentrating on
 is finding that little girl...

332
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,419
    and bringing that son of
      bitch to his knees.

333
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,421
     Now she's got a family
     that's missing her...

334
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:33,423
        people that are
      worried about her...

335
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,892
   now I know I don't need to
tell you, this guy's already...

336
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,927
    taken the lives of some
        of our brothers.

337
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,641
    So you keep that in mind
     when you run into him.

338
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:01,117
   I remember when you first
    came to live with us...

339
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:07,724
     dad told me it was my
   job to take care of you...

340
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,959
      cause I was bigger.

341
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,196
I remember this stormy night...

342
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,065
     ...after the ride and
     you couldn't sleep...

343
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:23,506
  so we sat on the porch with
dad, watched him finish a sixer

344
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:29,746
 and just listened to the rain.

345
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:36,119
      You asked dad if he
   ever got scared, remember?

346
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:41,457
   You remember what he said?

347
00:42:54,072 --> 00:43:00,243
 I wanna tell y'all something.
  Every man on this planet is
gonna have to face his demons...

348
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,245
       and his monsters.

349
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:09,319
 Now demons are tough, because
 they come from inside of you.

350
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:14,057
         Now monsters,
    completely different...

351
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,594
       the only monsters
      you have to fear...

352
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:21,764
       are the ones that
       walk on two legs.

353
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:33,042
      I remember thinking
    it was my job to protect
     you from the monsters.

354
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,546
   I never expected anything.

355
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:44,220
You may not be my little brother
  but you might as well be...

356
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:48,424
        and it's my job
       to protect you...

357
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:53,429
         and I'm sorry.

358
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,375
           (Screams)

359
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:16,199
Nurse: I think he's gonna be ok.
            - Yeah.

360
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:19,268
       Did they find that
       missing girl yet?
            - Nope.

361
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,740
      I sure hope they do.
        Bless her heart.

362
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:41,224
     Hey, hey, no no let...
    - What did you do to me?

363
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:46,295
Just save your life, that's all.
  - Then why does my ass hurt?

364
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:57,073
      Hey, did we get him?
  - No, he got a little girl.

365
00:47:58,443 --> 00:47:59,575
        Ah, we gotta...

366
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:02,979
       You just rest man
      let them handle it.

367
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:06,682
      Don't underestimate
        this guy again.

368
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:12,855
   There's a reason that some
    stories become legends.

369
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:16,492
We will get him, you just rest.

370
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:20,029
 I'd feel better about this if
    you were in play on it.

371
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:24,467
   Yeah, I'm working on that.

372
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:27,103
     Nurse: Officer Loomis?

373
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:27,904
              Yes.

374
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:29,572
   Somebody's here to see you

375
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,673
            Thanks.

376
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:43,352
        What'd you get?

377
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:44,353
    Everything I could find.

378
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:45,521
            Perfect.

379
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,590
      It's only for Wincer
        that I do this.

380
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,525
  If you get caught with this
  I'll tell them you stole it.

381
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,929
Hey, black man from out of town,
    I'm sure they'll buy it.

382
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,931
      I'm sure they will.

383
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,466
What are you looking for anyway?

384
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,135
   I mean no offense, but...

385
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,470
     the convict, that was
      your jurisdiction...

386
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,439
   this is a whole new thing.

387
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,007
      Just trying to help.

388
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:09,045
    You need to be careful.

389
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,081
   Listen, it's my fault that
       Wincer got hurt...

390
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,616
       so I'm gonna help
         any way I can.

391
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:16,118
 And I've heard enough word of
mouth stories about this guy...

392
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,522
    I do not care about the
   campfire version anymore.

393
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,791
        In this case...

394
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,893
  I think it's the same thing.

395
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:58,087
  Our investigation indicates
    that Ms. Rayborn left...

396
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:03,459
     of her own free will.
  Apparently, with a young man
 she had been seeing secretly.

397
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:08,164
       Frankly, given her
 home environment, I'm glad she
       finally got away.

398
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,199
           Thank you.

399
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,445
   (On radio) This is Dayton.

400
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,617
  I think we found her sir...

401
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,619
           the girl.

402
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,165
  Dayton: I want every officer
hat's not watching that house...

403
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,034
      walking these woods,
          high alert.

404
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,304
  This is ground zero, we fan
   out from this location...

405
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,708
  and we go in every direction
   until we find the fucker.
         Now let's go!

406
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,576
    Let's move! Let's move!
          Let's move!

407
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,513
            Mooney.

408
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,883
  This is Dayton, we're gonna
       set up a new grid.

409
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:35,217
        Figure that out.

410
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,812
       Loomis: Endurance.

411
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,784
     I asked my father what
     a lifetime as a police
      officer taught him.

412
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:12,321
That's what he said, endurance.

413
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,761
      He said that in the
    aftermath of tragedy...

414
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:21,897
     endurance is our only
  contribution to one another.

415
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,633
     Because, we can endure
     what they can't right?

416
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:28,003
  We're not directly involved.

417
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,174
      But he never had to
    face anything like this.

418
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:38,080
       He's right though,
   endurance is all we have.

419
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:43,085
 Sometimes the families of the
   victims turn against us...

420
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,321
      'cause it makes them
          feel better.

421
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:47,323
     And if it does, great.

422
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,993
      We've done our job.

423
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,930
     Now, this Dayton, he's
     an arrogant asshole...

424
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:58,701
  but he's a motivated asshole
and he will hunt this guy down.

425
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:03,505
  I'm sure this is the resume
 builder he's been waiting for.

426
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:06,408
       Did you read this?

427
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:11,547
   Yeah, interesting read but
    nothing really to go on.

428
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,383
  Yeah, now you know why these
   stories are so popular...

429
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,018
   with the kids around here.

430
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,887
    No, I became a believer
         this morning.

431
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,223
     Sometimes you hear so
      much of this shit...

432
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,627
       you forget it all
   started with real people.

433
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,032
            Oh fuck.

434
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,936
        Where's the kid?

435
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,973
           What kid?

436
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,377
      Easy, I don't think
      that's a good idea.

437
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:43,279
    I've been sitting on my
        ass long enough.

438
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,228
         Mind if I sit?

439
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:05,734
  We don't feel like answering
    any questions right now.

440
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,906
  I don't have any questions.

441
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:13,909
  I don't know where to start.

442
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,579
       12 years ago I was
       working a wreck...

443
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,684
  near here on Christmas Eve.

444
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,423
There wasn't much we could do...

445
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,426
  just waiting around for the
  fire department to show up.

446
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:37,666
   The hardest part of my job
      is notifying family.

447
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:59,822
 Your uncle was suppose to meet
   your parents in Atlanta...

448
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:02,858
        but instead, he
       brought you here.

449
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:11,133
     They let me go out on
       the boat with him.

450
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:22,978
 We go back early so he brought
me here instead of meeting them.

451
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:27,583
    My parents were pissed.

452
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,387
      They hated it here.

453
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,389
   Son they didn't hate it...

454
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,391
    they were scared of it.

455
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:08,223
        Yeah, Detective
       Loomis for Dayton.

456
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:11,059
       What the hell's he
     doing on Brewer Road?

457
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:14,062
 Dammit, get him off there he's
not doing us any good up there.

458
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,232
        This is Dayton.

459
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:20,302
    Yeah, patch him through.

460
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:24,072
      Dayton, it's Loomis.

461
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,042
     Hey there city, how's
      our boy holding up?

462
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:29,645
 Yeah, I'm looking at it now...

463
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,448
   figure if he's a hermit he
   might show up back here...

464
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,416
        but trust me, we
     searched that house...

465
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:36,418
    I got forensics sniffing
   around he's not in there.

466
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,653
          No, listen.

467
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,656
      Dayton, listen there
         is more to it.

468
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,892
 Look, as soon as Wincer starts
 feeling better you boys are...

469
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,662
 welcome to take a little walk
down here and see for yourselves

470
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:48,163
        but until then I
     gotta get back to it.

471
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:51,133
    No, listen dammit you've
      gotta look under it!

472
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,634
    There's a cellar you...

473
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,338
             Hello?

474
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,307
             Fuck!

475
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,199
   Forensics: I'd say time of
 death was sometime yesterday.

476
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,168
Ground's still dry under it too.

477
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,020
         That's my mom.

478
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:54,263
   I've never seen a picture
   of her this young before.

479
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,299
  That picture is from an old
police report from our station.

480
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:00,636
    She was the center of a
   missing persons search...

481
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,638
  when she was about that age.

482
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:04,640
             No...

483
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,611
       Dad was from here,
      she lived up north.

484
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:13,215
 Your dad and your mom had run
away from her abusive father...

485
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:17,686
  a farmer who lived near here
    by the name of Rayborn.

486
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:28,397
  Your father probably didn't
    know anything about it.
    He was just a baby then.

487
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:31,800
    He and uncle Mike didn't
      grow up together...

488
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,704
 they didn't get together until
    Steven and I were born.

489
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:40,776
  But that's not the story my
      father use to tell.

490
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,612
   That's not what I believe.

491
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:47,015
Your parents probably wanted you
 as far away from that past...

492
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,417
          as possible.

493
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:50,118
         Do you know...

494
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:57,392
  Do you know for sure that my
    parent's accident was...

495
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,395
            I don't.

496
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,601
They know not to come back here.

497
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:10,105
They avoided this place like the
   fucking curse that it is.

498
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:16,278
  They only came back for me.

499
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:24,786
 (On radio) Officer: Hey boss.

500
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,121
     Dayton: Yeah go ahead.

501
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,991
  This ain't the chick that's
       missing over here.

502
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:32,127
What the fuck you talking about?

503
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:35,497
   CSI is saying this girl's
 been dead a day, maybe longer.

504
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,833
          Easy, easy.

505
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,637
      We'll get her back.

506
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:47,109
         I need a car.

507
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:48,276
        What's going on?

508
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,512
 Your boy Dayton's about to let
         that girl die.

509
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,482
  The house has a basement or
  cellar or something to it...

510
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,517
   it's obviously well hidden
 and he wouldn't listen to me.

511
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,953
   Ok, find Sgt. Adams, he's
      a friend of mine...

512
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,055
   he's got a real knack for
       disobeying orders.

513
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:01,423
      Get him to lead his
        team out there.

514
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,425
    I'll get Wincer settled
  in and I'll meet you there.

515
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,599
           What's up?

516
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:13,101
    Loomis thinks Rayborn's
   hiding under his house...

517
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,836
   in a cellar or something.

518
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:15,937
    So he's going out there.

519
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,005
              And?

520
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,041
    Dayton wouldn't listen.

521
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,543
    Schmidty, I want you to
       watch these two...

522
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:26,815
      Shit, I want you to
    watch out for this guy.
      You, you're with me.

523
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,942
 (On radio): Suspect is a white
male, blue jeans, white t-shirt

524
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:56,511
       last seen heading
     towards the basement.

525
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,106
       Ah, hell with it.

526
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,008
    Alright, we're searching
        the house again.

527
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:03,078
        We searched it.

528
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:06,214
    We're gonna do it again,
        inside and out.

529
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:09,351
  If we breach the house we're
  gonna give up our position.

530
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,620
 Alright, did you not hear me?
 I said we're taking the house.

531
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:12,821
        That's an order.

532
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:13,955
     You don't give orders.

533
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,957
I do today, now let's move out.

534
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:33,441
         You got a gun?

535
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,377
Beats the hell out of a machete.

536
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:05,340
          Clear left.

537
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:07,309
          Clear right.

538
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:12,747
       Bathroom's clear.

539
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,131
    What are we doing here?
     I gotta get something.

540
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:30,859
         Do me a favor.

541
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,161
        If I don't make
       it back tonight...

542
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,132
    come back here and burn
   this place to the ground.

543
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:26,147
(On radio): This is team leader
      giving the all clear
      on the house, over.

544
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,983
 Looks like the house is clear.

545
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:30,452
      Surprise, surprise.

546
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:33,455
      I gotta take a piss.

547
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:46,768
       (Loud bang on car)

548
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,838
          Shit, shit.

549
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,742
        What the fuck?!

550
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:02,250
       (Gurgling noises)

551
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:14,996
Alright, so that cop said theres
  a cellar in Rayborn's house.

552
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,767
I'm gonna go distract the cops,
      you go around back.

553
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,169
        Hey, be careful.

554
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:43,551
       (Screams in pain)

555
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:17,018
             Hands!

556
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,688
     Let me see your hands!

557
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:24,125
What the hell are you doing here

558
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:27,662
     Looking for the cops,
     I can't find anybody.

559
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:33,301
            Ah shit.

560
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:41,809
  Where the hell is everybody?

561
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:45,647
  We don't know, we got blood
  all over this cruiser here.

562
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:48,816
    There's another cruiser
       up on the hill...

563
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,285
       but nobody inside.

564
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:51,619
        Try your radio?

565
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,655
    I couldn't reach anyone.

566
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,226
    Gotta search the house.

567
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,131
     Hold on just a second.

568
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,172
              Hey.

569
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:13,741
      I want you to go get
     in that cruiser and...

570
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:15,710
   lay down in the back seat
 until I come get you, alright?

571
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,812
           Fuck that.

572
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:25,019
      I wasn't asking you.

573
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:26,921
            Alright?

574
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,923
           After you.

575
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:40,028
      Is that gun loaded?

576
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:45,033
           Shoot me.

577
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,704
 I can't lift my arm to do it.

578
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,583
   Use my gun, they'll check.

579
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:14,896
    Don't go in that house.

580
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,765
        Close your eyes.

581
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,276
       I fucked this up.
       I fucked this up.

582
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:30,511
         No you didn't.

583
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,513
          We got him.

584
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,515
         You did good.

585
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,954
   I thought I was just gonna
       have to bleed out.

586
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,885
           Door left.

587
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:19,894
         (Man screams)

588
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,315
       It's me, it's me.
           - Steven?

589
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:49,016
       Back up. Back up.
      - Okay, okay, okay.

590
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,389
       Oh my god, Steven.
        - Are you okay?

591
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,024
      I'm okay. I'm okay.

592
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,059
          Where is he?

593
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,393
  I don't know, I don't know,
         I don't know.

594
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:00,461
       Alright, let's go.

595
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:02,463
        No, no this way.
           This way.

596
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:20,982
        (Both coughing)

597
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:32,059
             What?

598
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,095
    Corey's still in there.

599
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:36,964
     No, no Steven please.

600
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:39,233
Listen to me, I know he got out.

601
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:41,469
  Ok, he's not still in there.

602
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:44,138
   He would come back for me.

603
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,641
        Please don't go.

604
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:49,510
    Please, I know he's not
     still in there, okay?

605
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:55,683
 The villagers always kill the
monster with fire and pitchforks

606
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,119
             What?

607
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:02,623
  I'll come back for you, just
  stay in the truck you'll be
             safe.

608
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,659
   Please stay here, please.

609
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:06,661
    I'll come back for you.

610
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,064
              OK.

611
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:08,289
         Corey: Steven!

612
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:43,791
    (Corey screams in pain)

613
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:38,292
   Morgan: The only monsters
      you have to fear...

614
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:40,427
       are the ones that
       walk on two legs.

615
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:21,568
 I'm not afraid of you anymore.

616
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,392
           (Gunshot)

617
01:23:18,127 --> 01:23:20,427
         My dad says...

618
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:23,397
     a monster lives here.

619
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,635
          Not anymore.

620
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:03,330
      How you holding up?

621
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:05,265
        I'll be alright.

622
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:11,738
       I'll endure. You?
             Yeah.

623
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:18,645
 My dad use to say that people
  look at their scars as proof
      that they were hurt.

624
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:25,018
      It's also proof that
      there's healing too.

625
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:28,689
           Smart dad.

626
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,724
         Yeah, he was.

627
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:34,761
           Mine too.

628
01:26:43,299 --> 01:26:46,867
               ¶

629
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,354
   You know, I'm really glad
   you didn't sell the place.

630
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,990
         Yeah, me too.

631
01:27:09,992 --> 01:27:13,026
  I'm especially glad that you
  didn't have to burn it down.

632
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:18,865
   You still talk to Loomis.

633
01:27:19,034 --> 01:27:20,534
Not as much as before but, yeah.

634
01:27:20,536 --> 01:27:21,969
          Doing good.

635
01:27:21,971 --> 01:27:23,904
          Had a baby.
           - No shit.

636
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,939
      Well, his wife did.

637
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:33,780
 So how's the business running?

638
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:37,684
 It's going, got two new boats.

639
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:42,456
     Look at you, commodore
        Corey over here.

640
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:45,459
     Yep, I'm big time now.

641
01:27:46,195 --> 01:27:49,863
    Seriously though, uncle
     Morgan would be proud.

642
01:27:51,634 --> 01:27:56,470
       Jealous, yeah, but
     definitely not proud.

643
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:02,476
     Wanna go let baby girl
      open some presents?
    - Yeah, I guess we can.

644
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:12,252
   You didn't really get her
     a can of mace did you?
     - Nah, not this time.

645
01:28:12,254 --> 01:28:15,389
 Seriously, Amanda freaked out.

646
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:16,957
     Well, I mean not until
     I can get her a taser.

647
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,992
     I mean if she grows up
   half as pretty as her mom.

648
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:22,796
   Or worse, as pretty as me.

649
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:28,769
     That won't be so bad.
 - What? I'd be crazy hot as a
             girl.

650
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:33,440
  C'mon baby let's go inside.

651
01:28:35,044 --> 01:28:37,110
      Uncle Corey's ready
       to open presents.

652
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:40,947
            Morgan.

653
01:28:46,422 --> 01:28:47,654
             C'mon.

654
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:53,827
        You ready to go?
        - Why? Why? Why?
