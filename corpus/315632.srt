1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,352
Emma!

2
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,338
<i>Can you survive... on faith alone?</i>

3
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:28,419
My sister! My sister!

4
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:34,397
<i>Oceanic flight 815 has crashed
somewhere in the South Pacific</i>

5
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,365
<i>Two groups of passengers survived.</i>

6
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:40,192
Let it out.

7
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,353
- You are ok?
- Where is my mom?

8
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:45,577
<i>Separated...</i>

9
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:49,906
<i>on different sides of the same island.</i>

10
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:52,764
You a doctor?

11
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:56,057
Clinical Psychologist.

12
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:01,978
Saved that girl's life...
You a doctor?

13
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:05,039
No.

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,186
Help!

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,573
Hey! I need some help!

16
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:11,280
Someone in the jungle!
Its alive!

17
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,369
Please help me!

18
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:17,790
Help!

19
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,235
What's your name?

20
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,945
- Bernard.
- You are gonna be alright, Bernard.

21
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:34,349
You couldnt find any matches?

22
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:35,713
Dry ones?

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,745
Will be dark soon.

24
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,687
Gonna get a signal fire
started so they can find us.

25
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:44,642
- What are you, a boy scout?
- I'm in the peace corps.

26
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,725
They still have that?

27
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,973
I'm just happy somebody your
age actually knows what it is.

28
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,646
- I'm Ana Lucia.
- Goodwin.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,171
<i>The fight for survival will continue.</i>

30
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:03,608
<i>For on this island,
there are the survivors.</i>

31
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:06,475
<i>And... there are the Others.</i>

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,627
The Kids!
They took the kids!

33
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:19,461
They're gone.

34
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,598
- What is that?
- Its a list.

35
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:25,172
A list of what?

36
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,358
Of us.

37
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:29,699
Nothing?

38
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:32,499
They dragged nine
people into the jungle,

39
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:33,585
the kids,

40
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:34,974
and there's no sign of 'em?

41
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:36,576
Calm down.
Let's figure this out.

42
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,837
Here are the names of every
single person they took--

43
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:42,598
One of them had a list of us.

44
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,558
Maybe they're watching us.

45
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,052
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know...

46
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:48,995
- Anything.
- Why would they try to...

47
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,186
...infiltrate us?
I mean, that's crazy.

48
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,509
Why do you think
they're doing this?

49
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:56,871
Why do I think
who's doing what?

50
00:02:58,002 --> 00:02:58,635
Them.

51
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:02,125
Don't you ever wonder
why they attack us?

52
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:06,500
Maybe they're not attacking us.

53
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:11,289
Yeah, they just drag us into
the jungle every now and then.

54
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,533
No real harm done.

55
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,452
Can I ask you something?

56
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:18,797
Sure, Ana.

57
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,647
The day of the crash,

58
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,919
you ran out of the jungle

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,189
Ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.

60
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,655
You were never
even in the ocean.

61
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,794
Nathan...
Did you kill him?

62
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:36,946
Nathan was not a good person.

63
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,435
That's why he
wasn't on the list.

64
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,192
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?

65
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:46,144
The children are fine.

66
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,669
They're better off now.

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,975
<i>The two camps of survivors
are unknown to each other.</i>

68
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:27,485
<i>and on the other side of the island,
the search for help is set to launch.</i>

69
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:58,325
<i>and this hope for rescue
rises along the shore...</i>

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,088
<i>Fellow survivors make an
extraordinary discovery...</i>

71
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,983
My god...

72
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,391
What is this thing?

73
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,298
How long have you known
about this?

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,110
Three weeks, give or take.

75
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:18,434
You've been out here for three weeks digging
this thing up, and you never told me about it.

76
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,801
All due respect, Jack, but
since when do I report to you?

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,393
All due respect, John,
but you lied.

78
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,545
So how do we open it?

79
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:30,636
What?

80
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,710
You want to open it?

81
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,841
Best case scenario, there's supplies.
Worst case, we use it as a shelter.

82
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,780
Actually, Jack I can think
of much worse cases than that.

83
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,975
I'm happy to say goodbye
to this place forever.

84
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,999
What about everybody else?
Think they'll be okay?

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,136
Hope so, buddy.

86
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:53,873
At least until we can
get them some help.

87
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,972
I need for you to explain to me what the hell's
going on inside your head, John.

88
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:02,055
I think that's why you and I don't
see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

89
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,949
Because you're a man of science.

90
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,197
Yeah. And what does that make you?

91
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:08,262
Me? Well, I'm a man of faith.

92
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,719
Do you really think all this
is an accident?

93
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,937
You think we crashed
on this place by coincidence?

94
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,403
Especially this place?

95
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,598
We were brought here for a purpose

96
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,666
And who brought us here, John?

97
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:25,264
The island.

98
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:29,755
- It's destiny.
- I dont believe in destiny.

99
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:35,407
Something's out there.

100
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:42,727
Kate, you run the fuse.

101
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:45,526
Jack and I will rig the charges.

102
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,900
How many do we need
to blow the hatch?

103
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:54,713
Two should take care of the hinge.

104
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,185
Three to be safe.

105
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:12,305
What are you folks
doing this far out here?

106
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,050
We were on a plane crash.
We've been on an island for a month, man!

107
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,520
It's a good thing we found you.

108
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,495
Yeah!

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,100
Only the thing is,
we're gonna have to take the boy.

110
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,528
What? What'd you say?

111
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,833
Just give us the boy.

112
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,490
Hey! What?

113
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,461
Sawyer!

114
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,761
- Dad!
- No!

115
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,214
Walt! No!

116
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:40,915
Dad!

117
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,991
Help Dad! Help me!

118
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:52,060
Dad! Help me Dad!

119
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,686
Please!

120
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,343
Walt!

121
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:02,872
<i>But on this island...</i>

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,211
<i>the greatest test of faith...</i>

123
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:10,965
<i>...lies deep beneath the surface.</i>

124
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,425
<i>Nobody can tell ya</i>

125
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:33,752
<i>there's only one song worth...</i>

126
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,205
<i>The lower the surface...</i>

127
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,988
<i>A confrontation...</i>

128
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:17,853
Do not move!

129
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:22,165
Oh! What did you do?

130
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,298
<i>Across the island...</i>

131
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,020
<i>a discovery...</i>

132
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,650
Libby...

133
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:39,810
<i>As two cane ups make first contact...</i>

134
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,640
Is he alive?

135
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,047
Get Ana Lucía!
Quick!

136
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,300
You are gonna tell me
what's going on.

137
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:51,755
- Just let me...
- but you wanna get to work?

138
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,140
you're gonna tell me
how you got here.

139
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,210
It was three years ago.

140
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,420
I was on a solo race
around the world,

141
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,226
and my boat crashed into the reef,
and then Kelvin came.

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,024
Kelvin?

143
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,713
Kelvin. He comes
runnin' out the jungle.

144
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,110
"Hurry, hurry, come with me."

145
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,810
He brings me down here.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,900
First thing he does,
'cause it's beepin' already,

147
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,785
he types in the code,
he pushes the button, and it stops.

148
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,325
"What was all that
about?" I say.

149
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,570
"Just savin' the
world," he says.

150
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,140
Saving the world?

151
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,745
Then Kelvin died,
and now here I am all alone.

152
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,555
The end.

153
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
You are alright, Mike?

154
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,060
It was my fault.

155
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,350
I never should have
brought him on the raft.

156
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,035
I'm gonna get him back.

157
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:43,710
I'm gonna get back my son.

158
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,464
How about that?

159
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,060
Current brought us back.

160
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,215
We're home.

161
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,910
Don't tell me you believe this.
This is crazy.

162
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,535
You think that makes sense,
pushing a button?

163
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,920
You're gonna take
his word for it?

164
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,920
His word is all we have, Jack.

165
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,545
You don't have to
take my word for it.

166
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,000
Watch the film.

167
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,350
What?

168
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:16,500
The bookcase, top shelf,
Projector's in the pantry.

169
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,450
Welcome. I'm Dr.
Marvin Candle,

170
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,285
and this is the
orientation film

171
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,255
for station 3 of the
Dharma Initiative.

172
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,300
You and your partner are currently
located in station 3-- or the swan--

173
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,225
and will be for
the next 540 days.

174
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:41,270
Every 108 minutes,
the button must be pushed.

175
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,380
From the moment
the alarm sounds,

176
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,900
you will have four
minutes to enter the code

177
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,150
into the
microcomputer processor.

178
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,370
When the alarm sounds, either you or
your partner must input the code.

179
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,190
do not attempt to use
the computer for any--

180
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,400
Congratulations, until
your replacements arrive,

181
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,460
the future of the
project is in your hands.

182
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,880
We're gonna need to
watch that again.

183
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,241
<i>Across the island...</i>

184
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,980
- I'm Libby.
- Michael.

185
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,950
We're here.

186
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,150
<i>Another hidden station provides refuge.</i>

187
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,300
Did you ever think that
maybe they put you down here

188
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,890
to push a button every hundred
minutes just to see if you would--

189
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,815
that all of this--
the computer, the button--

190
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,360
it's just a mind game,
an experiment?

191
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,350
Every single day.

192
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,755
Hey, man...

193
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,590
It's okay. Sun?

194
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,400
You'll be with her again. Soon.

195
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,720
All right, all of you, get up.

196
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,240
We're moving out.

197
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,145
Moving out where?

198
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,120
Back to where you came from.

199
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,840
He pushed that button
every 108 minutes?

200
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,784
He did indeed.

201
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,730
And what happens
if we don't push it?

202
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,050
We're not going to find
out. I'm setting up a system.

203
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm still working on it, but
it looks like it's going to be

204
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,500
2-person shifts every 6 hours or so.

205
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,580
shifts?

206
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,040
Pushing a button?

207
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Hey.

208
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,860
Hey.

209
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,120
You, um, you took a shower.

210
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
I had to see if it worked.

211
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,000
How was it?

212
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,050
smelled a little bit
like sulfur, but

213
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,150
it was a shower.

214
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,740
Yeah. I know what you mean.

215
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,550
You could use one.

216
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,763
Maybe a little later.

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,390
I'll leave the shampoo for you.

218
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,050
Im fine.

219
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,542
Shut up.

220
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,760
If he talks he's gonna
get us all killed.

221
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,710
What happened to you people?

222
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,780
They came the first night...

223
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,650
they took three of us.

224
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,740
Then they came back
and took nine more.

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
They're smart,

226
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,900
and they're animals.

227
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,700
And they could be
anywhere at any time.

228
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,000
Now we're moving
through the jungle--

229
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
their jungle--

230
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,650
And if you think that one gun and
one bullet is gonna stop them,

231
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,550
think again.

232
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,520
They took my son.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,450
They took a lot of things.

234
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,035
You hooked it.

235
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:20,565
Try keeping your
left arm straight.

236
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,000
So you think you
could do better?

237
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,430
Anyone can hit a ball.
That's not golf.

238
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,150
And what's golf?

239
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,990
Golf is accuracy.

240
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:34,660
Well, why don't we
play a few holes

241
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,330
and see which one of
us is more accurate?

242
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>The journey across the island,
nears its end.</i>

243
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,302
Hey, hey.

244
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:49,886
Sawyer.

245
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,239
Got it.

246
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:56,350
You may wanna move.

247
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,631
What?

248
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,000
Where is the doctor?

249
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:09,700
I got him.

250
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,680
- Is he okay?
-To the bathroom.

251
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,590
He's burning up.
Gotta get him in the shower.

252
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,065
and bring his fever down.

253
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,300
<i>Two camps...
separated...</i>

254
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,181
<i>now finally....
reunited.</i>

255
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

256
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,770
Swallow....
Swallow, swallow.

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,900
Here, I'll do it.

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,900
- No, no. I got it.
- I can do it.

259
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Sawyer...

260
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,125
It's Kate.

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,685
You need to listen to me, okay?

262
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,300
The only way that you are gonna get
better is if you take this pill.

263
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,500
Swallow.

264
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,250
Swallow.

265
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,600
- Ok.
- Nice job.

266
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,765
Never learned the whole
whisper-in-the-ear thing in med school.

267
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,948
<i>You are confused...</i>

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,515
- Im sorry.
- Are you?

269
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,150
<i>...and afraid.</i>

270
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,500
Yeah. Im sorry.

271
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,970
- What's going on with you?
- Just forget it.

272
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,975
- No, no, dont walk away from me, no.
- Let me go! Don't!

273
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,650
<i>So, where do you turn?</i>

274
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,000
Its ok. Its ok.

275
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,085
<i>You listen to your head...</i>

276
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:15,665
Its alright. Its alright.

277
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,100
<i>or you follow your heart?</i>

278
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,420
Is this washer and dryer newer
than everything else in here?

279
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,170
It washes clothes.
That's all I need to know.

280
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,628
Ah, finally.
Someone who keeps it simple.

281
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,435
Oh, hey, look at this.

282
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,730
You think I can pull this off?

283
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,600
Uh?

284
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,265
Turn aroud. I wanna try it on.
Around.

285
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,833
- Oh. Oh, sure, yeah. Go ahead.
- No peeking.

286
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,035
Okay, turn around.

287
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,590
- What do you think?
- It's awesome.

288
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,000
Thanks.

289
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,810
What are you writing?

290
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,742
Things I need to remember.

291
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,565
So you're Eko, huh?

292
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,300
Yes.

293
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,230
Claire.

294
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,035
And this is Aaron.

295
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,300
Aaron?

296
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,150
The brother of Moses?

297
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,126
Yeah, that must have been
tough to live up to, right?

298
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,750
Pressure of everyone saying,

299
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,730
"why can't you be more
like your brother Moses?"

300
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,935
Yes, I'm sure it was.

301
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,221
<i>A father...</i>

302
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,645
<i>...separated from his son.</i>

303
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,080
<i>A call for help...</i>

304
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,695
Locke?

305
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
<i>An act of desperation...</i>

306
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,095
John...

307
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:48,135
- Stay in there. Stay--
- Michael!

308
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,725
I'm going after my son,
and nobody is going to stop me, okay?

309
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:54,750
Okay? That is my right.
That is a father's right.

310
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,510
We can do this together. Ok?

311
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,625
I have to do it alone.

312
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,070
I think we'd better head back.

313
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:05,945
What?

314
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,985
- Just find the trail, John.
- I've lost the trail.

315
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,460
You don't just lose a trail.

316
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,695
Yeah, that's right, Jack.

317
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,315
I've been running
through the jungle

318
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,345
toward the sound of gunfire
because I don't care about Michael.

319
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,378
You know what happens if we
just turn around and go back?

320
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,800
We're never gonna
see him again,

321
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,465
and that's gonna be on us--

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,900
You're exactly right, Jack!

323
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:29,520
But if I were you,

324
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,800
I'd listen to Mr. Locke.

325
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,615
Who are you?

326
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,850
He's the son of a bitch
who shot me on the raft.

327
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,000
Why don't you
point the gun down?

328
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:49,050
Probably be best if we just keep
our hands at our sides, gentlemen.

329
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,415
Where's Michael?

330
00:21:50,455 --> 00:21:51,775
Dont worry about Michael.

331
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:53,725
He's not gonna find us.

332
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:55,470
You took Walt.

333
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:57,755
Walt's fine.

334
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,155
Very special boy.

335
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:06,250
Tell me, you go over a man's
house for the first time,

336
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:10,575
you walk in the kitchen and eat
food that doesn't belong to you,

337
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:14,145
open the door to rooms you
got no business opening?

338
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,350
This is not your island.

339
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,000
This is our island.

340
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:22,486
And the only reason
you're living on it

341
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:25,140
is 'cause we let
you live on it.

342
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,073
I don't believe you.

343
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:33,017
I  think you've got one
guy up there with a gun.

344
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,010
I think there's more of
us than there are of you.

345
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,100
It's an interesting theory.

346
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,300
Light 'em up!

347
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,985
We got a
misunderstanding, Jack...

348
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,745
So listen carefully.

349
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:54,000
Right here there's a line.

350
00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:59,085
You cross that line,
we go from misunderstanding to...

351
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,825
something else.

352
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:06,770
Now give me your weapons, turn around.
Go home.

353
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:09,027
No.

354
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:12,187
- Jack, maybe--
- No!

355
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,400
I hoped it wouldn't
come to this.

356
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:20,010
Bring her out, Alex!

357
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:23,460
She was following you.

358
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:25,315
Dont.

359
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,295
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

360
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:52,850
Jack, I...

361
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:01,420
- You all right?
- Yeah.

362
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,400
<i>A new day dawns...</i>

363
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,400
<i>and the same thread remains.</i>

364
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,050
Is it true that you
killed one of them?

365
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:36,760
Sayid tells me
that you're a cop.

366
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:38,355
I was a cop.

367
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,000
May I ask you something?

368
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:42,548
Shoot.

369
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,470
How long do you think it
would take to train an army?

370
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,368
<i>And this conflict with the Others
grows closer...</i>

371
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,100
<i>Some questions...</i>

372
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:54,335
We are here.

373
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,225
<i>May be answered.</i>

374
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:57,620
Over Here!

375
00:24:57,902 --> 00:24:59,065
Help me!

376
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:00,645
Dont believe a word he says.

377
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,575
Help!

378
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,815
It's one of them.

379
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,506
My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota.

380
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,825
He's lying.

381
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:11,400
- Please.
- I'm going to cut him down.

382
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:13,265
You're making a
serious mistake.

383
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,380
Wait!

384
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:24,040
- Minnesota, huh?
- That's the question, isn't it?

385
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:29,178
- Who are you?
- Henry. Henry Gale.

386
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:30,835
How did you get to this island?

387
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,000
We crashed, my wife and I.

388
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:35,200
- Crashed in what?
- A balloon.

389
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:37,880
We were trying to
cross the Pacific.

390
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:42,850
She died.
she got sick three weeks ago.

391
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:44,155
What the hell is going on here?

392
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,375
Rousseau trapped
him in the jungle.

393
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:49,935
She believe he's an other.

394
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:53,102
You let Jack treat him first,
then we'll get our answers.

395
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:55,980
I think he's pretty convincing.

396
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,105
The real problem
is there's no way

397
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,700
we can be sure he's
telling the truth.

398
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,795
That is not necessarily true.

399
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,638
Sayid!

400
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,260
Hey, what the hell you doin'?

401
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,216
- Sayid!
- What needs to be done.

402
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:23,550
Why isn't this
combination working, John?

403
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:24,765
Did you change it?

404
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:25,635
Yeah.

405
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,600
Why would you do that?

406
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,365
Tell me who you are!

407
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,900
Sayid!

408
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,120
Sayid!

409
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:36,135
Jack.

410
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,950
Open it. Open it now.

411
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:44,135
Open that damn door, you understand me?!
You open it now!

412
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:45,445
No.

413
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:48,240
You want to push the button?
Open the door.

414
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:51,200
<i>When its all on the line...</i>

415
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,095
<i>where do you stand?</i>

416
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,800
- You wouldn't.
- What? I wouldn't what?

417
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,128
If we don't...
you would risk everyone's lives?

418
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't think anything's gonna
happen when we get down to zero.

419
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,635
- Jack...
- You want to see what's gonna happen?

420
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,505
Let's just see
what's gonna happen.

421
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:12,770
<i>Do you listen to reason?</i>

422
00:27:15,695 --> 00:27:16,815
<i>or at life?</i>

423
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:42,763
That's enough!

424
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:45,335
<i>How do you know...</i>

425
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,035
What are we doing, Jack?

426
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:54,500
What are we doing?

427
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,130
We can't hide him
down here forever.

428
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:57,295
No, just..

429
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,595
I want to know what
the long-term plan is.

430
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:03,800
Well, John,
let me ask you this--

431
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,880
we don't have a long-term
plan for the button,

432
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,695
but we keep pushing it,
don't we?

433
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:15,430
- No cheeseburgers, huh?
- No cheeseburgers.

434
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:17,814
Bon appétit.

435
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:22,020
I just don't understand why you
let the doctor call the shots.

436
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,365
No one calls the shots.

437
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:30,650
Jack and I make
decisions together.

438
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:33,885
Right. Okay.

439
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,530
Morning, Jack.

440
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,810
You couldn't wait 'til
I was done in here?

441
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,515
The steam opens up my pores.

442
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:09,460
I also thought this might be
a good time to talk about our problem.

443
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,905
- Our problem?
- Our Henry problem.

444
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,325
I think we need to bring in
some new blood.

445
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,455
Obviously, you have someone in mind.

446
00:29:17,095 --> 00:29:18,985
What do you think about Ana Lucia?

447
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:21,290
I'll talk to her.

448
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,865
I already did.

449
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:25,830
In there with him now.

450
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,475
Where did Sawyer
find one of these anyway?

451
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,840
I mean, who flies
with a pregnancy test, right?

452
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,015
Have you ever taken one?

453
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,350
Yeah.

454
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,815
You're pregnant.

455
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:52,370
Sayid.

456
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:54,690
Can I talk to you?

457
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:56,070
Of course.

458
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:57,635
Alone?

459
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:02,065
Whatever you need to say
you can say it here.

460
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:06,550
- It's about the hatch.
- You mean the guy locked in the closet there?

461
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,985
What about him?

462
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:12,678
It's to his balloon.

463
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,584
How did you get him to do this?

464
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,395
I asked nicely.

465
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:20,085
This is at least a day's walk.

466
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,720
Then we should get going.

467
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,650
These tests are pretty accurate.

468
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,720
But it's impossible.

469
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:31,400
Oh no,  it's possible.

470
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,600
Congratulations, Sun.

471
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm going to get back to the hatch.

472
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:37,735
You've been down there a lot, Jack.

473
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,000
Is everything okay?

474
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:40,255
Sure.

475
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:42,450
Yeah. Everything is fine.

476
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,365
That cliff there appears to be this.

477
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,110
Score one for Henry.

478
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,050
Pointing out
a geographical touchstone

479
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,025
does not mean
he's leading us to a balloon.

480
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,465
Maybe not, but at least
we're on the right island.

481
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,855
This must be my reward
for good behavior, huh?

482
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,800
I guess I earned myself some good will
for finally drawing that map for Ana.

483
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:10,820
What map?

484
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:12,220
To my balloon.

485
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:14,590
- Did you...
- No.

486
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:19,380
Wow, you guys have some real
trust issues, don't you?

487
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:21,885
Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you.

488
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,620
I mean, with the two of you
fighting all the time.

489
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,115
Of course,
if I was one of them --

490
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,035
these people that you
seem to think are your enemies --

491
00:31:32,185 --> 00:31:34,645
I'd draw a map to a real secluded place

492
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:37,290
good place for a trap

493
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,575
And when your friends got there a bunch
of my people would be waiting for them.

494
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,935
Then they'd use them to trade for me.

495
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,230
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

496
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,130
You guys got any milk?

497
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:57,760
Easy.

498
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,475
That's good. Ok, one more.

499
00:32:00,225 --> 00:32:03,530
Uh, Sawyer, when you were
over there across the island,

500
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:06,440
how well did you get
to know those tailies?

501
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,385
Well enough, why?

502
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:11,270
That Libby chick
seems pretty cool.

503
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:13,190
I mean, is she?

504
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,725
Whoa, you got a little love
connection brewin' over there, Jabba?

505
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:19,820
- No, just askin'.
- Yeah, I hear you askin'.

506
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,030
Forget it.

507
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:35,205
<i>What do you do when your faith
is put to the test?</i>

508
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,000
<i>four...</i>

509
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:37,511
<i>three...</i>

510
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:38,760
<i>two...</i>

511
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:39,870
<i>one...</i>

512
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:50,715
What happened?

513
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,725
Hurley. You seen Ana Lucia?

514
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:57,820
She took off into the jungle with
Charlie and Sayid yesterday.

515
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,485
They say anything about
where they were going?

516
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:02,445
That would, like, assume that
anyone actually tells me anything.

517
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,145
Maybe, if I were in the loop,
I could be more helpful.

518
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:07,650
There is no loop, Hurley.

519
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:09,300
Lets go.

520
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,470
<i>Trapped in the hatch...</i>

521
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:13,075
<i>...and no way out.</i>

522
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:13,780
Harder!

523
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:15,665
<i>Who do you trust?</i>

524
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,125
The toolbox. Get the toolbox.

525
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,000
Come on! Come on! Put it under.

526
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,990
John, John, wait. Don't you think--

527
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,130
All right. We'll wait till
somebody comes. All right?

528
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:35,260
No, we don't have time.

529
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,985
That button has to be pushed.

530
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,140
Over here! This way!

531
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,000
He said he buried her, right?

532
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:51,920
Why isn't it raining here?

533
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:06,400
Henry!

534
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:15,400
<i>In crisis...</i>

535
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:18,100
<i>...comes discovery.</i>

536
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,720
<i>but where does it all lead?</i>

537
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,420
Hey, Jack.

538
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:41,495
- You heading back to the hatch?
- Yeah.

539
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,350
Mind if I join?

540
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:46,400
Been a while since I had a shower,
and I was just hoping that--

541
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:48,625
Actually, the--
the plumbing's busted.

542
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,265
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

543
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:56,530
Its a parachute.

544
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,000
Wait!

545
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:11,500
What'd you find?

546
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,200
I did what you told me to.

547
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,665
I punched in the code and
pressed the execute button, but

548
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,025
nothing happened.

549
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,435
- Get away from him!
- Wait. You don't--

550
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:24,575
Step back right now.

551
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:26,705
- I said get away!
- It's all right.

552
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:30,245
Couldn't you find my balloon?

553
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,355
We did find your balloon, Henry Gale.

554
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:35,655
We also found the grave you described--

555
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,030
Still I did not
believe it to be true.

556
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,600
So I dug up that grave,

557
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,415
and found that there was not a
woman inside. There was a man.

558
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,435
A man named Henry Gale.

559
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,450
Sorry.

560
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:00,235
Good.

561
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,235
- How you holding up?
- Depends on Jack's best guess.

562
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:06,655
There's a small fracture.

563
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:07,860
How long until I can walk?

564
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,530
You're gonna have to keep
off it a couple of weeks.

565
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:15,400
Come on, you're doing great.
You know, exercise is addictive.

566
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,855
I can't see why.

567
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,680
Guess I need to
drop a few pounds.

568
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,655
Don't be so hard on yourself.

569
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:27,270
Some people's metabolisms
are just a little slower.

570
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,110
It's not my metabolism.

571
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:32,755
I'm sick.

572
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,675
When we first crashed here,
I thought this isn't all bad.

573
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,690
It's like the all-mango diet.

574
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,225
I wasn't turning any
heads or nothing, but

575
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:44,090
I did drop a
couple belt sizes.

576
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:45,465
Then we found this hatch,

577
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:47,185
and it was full of food...

578
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,025
tons of food.

579
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:53,260
You want to change?
Then change.

580
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,850
They found something! Come on!

581
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:25,960
How many of you are there?

582
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,990
If I told you about them,
you have no idea what he'll do.

583
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,550
- He?
- He mean their leader.

584
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,515
The guy with the beard?

585
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:38,000
He's no one. Nothing!

586
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,275
Hey.

587
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:41,245
How many of you are there?

588
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,800
- He'll kill me!
- I'll kill you!

589
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,155
You can't do this!
I am not a bad person!

590
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,325
What the hell's wrong with you?

591
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,345
What's going on?!
I heard a gunshot!

592
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,525
- Jack!
- I've got it covered, John.

593
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:03,210
- I saw it first.
- You are stealing my stuff!

594
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:06,525
You guys are like locusts.
How about a little order here?

595
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:09,055
I'm sure everyone can manage
to just take what they need.

596
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,490
Great plan, moonbeam.

597
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:13,148
After that, we can sing "kumbaya"
and do trust falls.

598
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:16,585
So, Henry...

599
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,755
I was thinking about
something you were saying

600
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,625
You were saying that
if you were one of them,

601
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:24,945
that you'd lead
us into a trap...

602
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,385
capture our people...

603
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:29,820
force a trade.

604
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,010
Us, for you.

605
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:34,970
Pretty good idea, Henry.

606
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:38,395
I'm going out to the line that
we're not supposed to cross

607
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,530
and telling them
that we've got you.

608
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,100
And if they want you back,
its gonna cost 'em.

609
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:48,455
And when we get Walt back...

610
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
You might just have been
worth all the trouble.

611
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,105
They'll never give you Walt.

612
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,855
I'm flattered.

613
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:06,725
Yeah? Why is that?

614
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,160
'Cause you chose me to go
with you instead of Sawyer.

615
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,100
I only asked you
because they don't want you.

616
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,990
They grabbed you,
had you at gunpoint.

617
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,845
They could have kept you,
but they didn't.

618
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,725
Then again,
they didn't really want me, either.

619
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:21,705
Damaged goods.
Both of us.

620
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,690
Its a doll.

621
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:28,555
Wait, wait, no-- no, don't--

622
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:35,825
- You okay?
- Yeah.

623
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,295
Oh, good. So you can hear me.

624
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,985
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get the gun.

625
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,440
- I can't get my arm around.
- All right, here, let me.

626
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,865
Ok.
Got it, got it, got it.

627
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:03,335
Nice shot.

628
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,025
You're in my spot.

629
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,535
I can move.

630
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,430
Can you?

631
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,215
Oh, that's funny.

632
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,495
I guess your sense of humor got
trapped under that door with your leg.

633
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,295
So what are you doing
down here, John?

634
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:28,840
I'm done with the hatch.

635
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,535
Oh, now,
you're just frustrated.

636
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:36,453
You'll be out of that splint and running
around the island again in no time.

637
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,745
And yet Jack said it'd
be at least four weeks.

638
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:44,800
But, honey, you and I both know
it's not gonna take that long.

639
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,915
<i>Can you survive on faith alone?</i>

640
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:50,710
We are here.

641
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,075
Right there is where I...

642
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:56,450
where I laid my gun down.

643
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:01,305
<i>Or you take matters
into your own hands...</i>

644
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,050
Hey!

645
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:04,255
You hear me?

646
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,199
<i>to right what is wrong?</i>

647
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,530
We've got your man!

648
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,952
<i>What would you do?</i>

649
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,355
If you want him back,
you're gonna have to come out here!

650
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,250
- Come on out!
- Jack!

651
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,525
I know you're out there!
I know you can hear me!

652
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:19,220
Jack, they're not here.

653
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,965
I'll be right here
until you talk to me!

654
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:26,550
I'll be right here!

655
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,690
How long are you
gonna wait, Jack?

656
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,825
Till I get my voice back.

657
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,765
Then I'm gonna yell some more.

658
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,050
I'm sorry I kissed you.

659
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:47,790
I'm not.

660
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,235
Michael.
