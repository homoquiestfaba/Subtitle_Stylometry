- Mainly when there 
nothing to worry about. 

63

- You will have to get me out of 
penalty area after school. 

71 
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,972

other children, right? 

72 
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:05,014

We will share this office. 

109 
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,791 
- The Department of Anthropology 
had no more space ... 

110 
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,327 
... then I spent here. 

111 
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,091

- I do not remember having directed 
word, Mr. Tyler. 

117 
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:03,710

118 
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,048 
- Maybe counted in dog years. 

119 
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:09,886

00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,741

127 
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,343 
- Pests! 

128 
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,817 
- She did one of those novels 
passing night. 

129 
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:40,820 
- You know, those full of sex and scandal? 
She quickly makes friends, right? 

130 
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:45,587 
- I think it is far from dying 
suffocated by his own vomit. 

131 
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:46,889

- I met her sister. 
- I know! 

134 
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:55,032 
- You're the kind of ... 
"My friends call me Ty." 

135 
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,998 
- And I bet you want to cause 
a good impression, right? 

136 
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:02,541 
- I have a job for you. 
Come! 

137 
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:06,782 
- Then, Bryn, always take pictures 
when you move into a new place? 

138 
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:11,082 
- Well ... yes. 

139 
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,919 
- I think so. 

140 
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,927 
- I always do. 

141 
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:21,565 
- It is cocnocer the new place? 
Have more control? It's smart. 

142 
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:27,171 
- What do you do, Will? 
- Work on "KIein, Horstman & Enos." 

143 
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:29,737

- Monitoring the Stock Market 
Singapore. 

146 
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:37,373 
- That is, basically ... 

147 
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:41,313 
... an elegant way of saying 
I'm stuck 
the night shift. 

148 
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:45,388 
- These photos are yours? 

149 
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,118 
- Yes, take a few years ago. 

150 
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,797

some newer. 

151 
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,398 
- Yes, I think so. 

152 
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,366 
- Will, could you bring me that box? 

153 
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:09,471 
- White and black? 

154 
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,980 
- I like things 
the old fashioned way. 

155 
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:16,517 
- The black and white is not a 
bad way to see the world. 

156 
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,155 
- Look around ... 
As the call? 

157 
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:23,460

158 
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:35,839 
- What is it? 

159 
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,132 
- Do not know. 

160 
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:40,742 
- A shadow maybe, the mechanism? 

161 
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,240 
- No, that's an arm. 

162 
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,547 
- And that's a face. It's a ... 

163 
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:51,452 
-No. 
- It's a boy! 

164 
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,248 
- No, it can be. 

165 
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:42,229 
- Hello? 

166 
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:16,038 
- You must help me! 
Following me! 

167 
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,037 
- Who? Who is followed? 

168 
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,099 
- We got it! Here was 
that the thief entered and left. 

169 
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,673 
- He was to be behind the car radios. 

170 
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:54,435 
- There is a building block ... 

171 
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:57,910 
... where all the cars stolen 
the garage. 

172 
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:01,912 
- I will send repair this door 
and install a safety lock. 

173 
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:03,611 
- Excellent. 

174 
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:08,416 
- And you sir? There is something else you 
or your spouse wish to report? 

175 
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,389 
- We are not married. 
- Really? 

176 
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:13,597 
- Sorry. 

177 
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:16,767 
- I like to go 
my department. 

178 
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,696 
- The accompany. 

179 
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:20,336 
- The hero, the salvos! 

180 
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:23,598 
- It is "the winner" official. 
To the victor, the salvos. 

181 
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:29,710 
- And is not no hero! 

182 
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,873 
- I know. 

183 
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,649 
- Third, please. 

184 
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:46,189 
- I'm sure the police 
find the man. 

185 
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,828 
- You must be new in town. 

186 
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,733 
- Is sure to be right? 

187 
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:59,137 
- Yes. Nothing a bath 
warm and long no cure. 

188 
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,818 
- Thanks. 

189 
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:15,924 
- Excuse me, what is your name? 

190 
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,923 
- Vanessa Carver. 
- Paul Shaw. 

191 
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:23,997 
- Nice, Paul Shaw. 

192 
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:51,657 
- Hello? 

193 
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:54,554 
- Bryn? Dear? 

194 
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:56,756 
- I'm here! 

195 
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,468 
- You took pictures! 
- Yes, some things. 

196 
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:07,735 
- Nothing important. 

197 
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:09,911 
- And how did it go? 

198 
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:20,915 
- This was an excellent idea. 

199 
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,889 
- It occurred to me suddenly. 

200 
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,793 
- Then, she was pretty? 

201 
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:30,133 
- Who? 
-Who? 

202 
00:21:31,702 --> 00:21:34,535 
- Your damsel in distress. 
It was pretty? 

203 
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:38,367 
- No, she was a witch. 
Calva, three teeth. 

204 
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:39,565 
- You're lying! 

205 
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:43,406 
- She had an eye on 
middle of the forehead. 

206 
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:46,917 
- One of the things 
I love you. 

207 
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:50,951 
- Today I met a friend of Christine. 
Will Tyler. He is handsome. 

208 
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:54,516 
- Should fall in love 
and have babies. 

209 
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:58,922 
- And you think that Chrissy? 
- I think he will. 

210 
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:02,996 
- Today he saved me 
a horrible woman in the hall. 

211 
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,430 
- Vanessa. 

212 
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:11,264 
- Vanessa? 
- Yes, it's an actress or model or something. 

213 
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:18,175 
- So, back to the woman 
you saved today. What is your name? 

214 
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,587 
- In the midst of confusion 
I forgot to ask. 

215 
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,429 
- Danny! 

216 
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:50,170 
- Danny! Danny! 

217 
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:51,635 
- Danny! 

218 
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:09,682 
- Find a focus, girls. 
That. 

219 
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,320 
- Smile. 

220 
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:20,166 
- Fingers stretched. 

221 
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,083 
- The kids call him 
"Surfing in the elevator." 

222 
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:41,382 
- They get on the roof of the elevator 
and jump from one to another. 

223 
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:43,355 
- And where are the parents? 
Where are the parents? 

224 
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,791 
- They are drunk? Drugged? 
This is dangerous! 

225 
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,897 
- I mean, look at these pictures! 
"No! 

226 
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,363 
"No, look! This guy ... 
"It's not Daniel. 

227 
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,762 
- Not Daniel. 

228 
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:58,468 
- I know it's not Daniel! 

229 
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:00,870 
- You think that's the point? 

230 
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:03,046 
- And is not it? 
-No. 

231 
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,252 
- Okay, Bryn. 
No problem. 

232 
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:14,952 
- No problem. 

233 
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,024 
- I'm having dreams again. 

234 
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:27,601 
- You told Paul? 
"No, he is with his new job. 

235 
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:34,173 
- Two classes per week 
for repeaters in Science. 

236 
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:37,005 
- Three years ago, 
it rained bids. 

237 
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:41,150 
- He should not blame yourself. 
"He did not do it. 

238 
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,476 
- I do not blame. 

239 
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,534 
- Professor Paul! 
I brought donuts. 

240 
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:10,077 
- I hope you enjoy. 

241 
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:46,408 
- Hello, darling. 
Are you okay? 

242 
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:55,018 
- I told you not to go out! 

243 
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:57,921 
- Please, no! No! No! 

244 
00:26:58,128 --> 00:27:00,494 
- Look at me! 
Look at me when I'm talking about! 

245 
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:02,028 
- Look into my eyes! 
"Please, Dad! 

246 
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:04,462 
- Look at me! 

247 
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:09,664 
- Now you'll see! 
I'll give you a lesson! 

248 
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,905 
-Paul! 
-Bryn, what happens? 

249 
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:20,174 
- He was beating 
I heard the blows and screams! 

250 
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:22,147 
- And I could not ... 
- What? Who? 

251 
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:24,718 
- You are Mr. Shaw? 
- Yes, Paul Shaw. 

252 
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:26,412 
- Bryn, who is going? 
Are you okay? 

253 
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:28,181 
- Yes. 
- I Karasic official. 

254 
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:30,724 
- This is the official Ford. 
- Mr. Shaw. 

255 
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:32,520 
- His wife says he 
witnessed aggression. 

256 
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,356 
- I saw the children get there! 

257 
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:36,294 
- I heard screaming, 
and then I heard the shots ... 

258 
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,593 
... and now let us 
go there ... 

259 
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:41,999 
- You did not understand ... 
"Please, Mr. Butters. 

260 
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:44,970 
- Mr. Butters, you can open 
the door and show us? 

261 
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:53,081 
- Police! 

262 
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,563 
- I saw him coming here, Paul. 
It's true. 

263 
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:10,756 
- No one lives here for months! 

264 
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,728 
- The apartment is empty. 

265 
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:17,532 
- Maybe these people fled as 
I call my wife to you. 

266 
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,470 
- And how they could get? 

267 
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:22,338 
- Change the locks whenever 
a tenant moves out. 

268 
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:24,946 
- I hold the keys 
in a chest down. 

269 
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:26,410 
- Who lived here? 

270 
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,484 
- The Nash family. 
They moved six months ago. 

271 
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,816 
- Why? 

272 
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:36,857 
- There was an accident. 
Their son was playing ... 

273 
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,551 
- In the elevator? 

274 
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,732 
- The boy slipped, fell down. 
It was terrible. 

275 
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,895 
- I saw him. 

276 
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,571 
- Damn, how many types of 
shampoo can be? 

277 
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:06,316 
- No one should underestimate 
the imprtancia a good shampoo. 

278 
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:08,115 
- One bottle can last for weeks. 

279 
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,986 
- Much more than a few 
of my relationships. 

280 
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,524 
- I think I can 
with commitment. 

281 
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:14,060 
- Well, lets see what is 
most important to you. 

282 
00:29:14,264 --> 00:29:17,961 
- A good body? Resilience? 

283 
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:20,500 
- The elasticity provided 
is welcome. 

284 
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:22,604 
- Most men 
I prefer easy. 

285 
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:25,604 
- I prefer not sting the eyes. 
"Oh, you're the sensitive! 

286 
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:27,305 
- Here. 

287 
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,877 
- "Makes brushing." 
It is not for you. 

288 
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:33,415 
... "Balance", "fruity" ... 

289 
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:36,017 
- How about this? 

290 
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:39,450 
- "Bold"? 
I think it's an excellent choice. 

291 
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,951 
- And you are doing here. 
These harassing me? 

292 
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,154 
- I still have my way to work. 

293 
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:52,233 
- Oh, yeah. Bryn told me 
you work at night 
in a bank. 

294 
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:54,734 
- That must be exciting. 

295 
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:58,374 
- I used to be. Now I would like 
more time for me. 

296 
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:01,543 
- Maybe we can get 
agreement on that. 

297 
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,773 
- Where is your cart? 

298 
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:07,775 
- Oh, you better 
Go look. 

299 
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,014 
- Or I'll walk 
to your car. 

300 
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:22,194 
- Hello, Bryn. 
Oh, Hello. 

301 
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,924 
- I'm coming. 

302 
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:32,842 
- Something does not smell right here, 
Indeed, Bobby? 

303 
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:36,672 
- A false alarm 
never smells good. 

304 
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,814 
- Why? 

305 
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:42,076 
- It's just a hunch. 

306 
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:45,652 
- You know that woman 
not told us everything. 

307 
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,416 
- Let, Kit remember what 
happened the last time. 

308 
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,287 
- Believe me. 
Your psychiatrist would say the same. 

309 
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,589 
- And who said the officers? 

310 
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,727 
- Is upset, 
and gave us a sermon. 

311 
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,021 
- I was told that Bryn 
under psychiatric treatment? 

312 
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:30,332 
- Yes. The officer said that as 
half of the city ... 

313 
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,331 
... following treatment. 

314 
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:34,031 
- Bitch! 

315 
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:37,331 
- The building superintendent, Mr. Butters, 
I try to calm things down. 

316 
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:44,239 
- Bryn told me that you showed 
photos of the child. 

317 
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:47,382 
- Yes, I asked him to forget it. 
She did not want to mess. 

318 
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:53,845 
- You said you are having 
dreams again? 

319 
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:26,789 
- Here you go. 

320 
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,220 
"Shoot the spider" 

321 
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:41,903 
- Hey, son! Let me take you out 
a photo. Come here! 

322 
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,504 
- Mom, I'm going to lose 
"Shoot the spider! 

323 
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:45,402 
- Only one more to the album! 

324 
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,099 
- Now smile! 
That! 

325 
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,743 
- Look at the sky. 
A picture for Dad! 

326 
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:51,345 
"Mom! 
- I know, you're going to lose 
"Shoot the chandelier." 

327 
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:53,106 
- Okay! Done. 

328 
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,307 
- Now you can go. 

329 
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:58,153 
- Look at me, Mom! 
Look at me! 

330 
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:02,983 
- Thanks. 

331 
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,467 
- Thanks. 

332 
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,514 
- He's coming. 

333 
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:46,685 
- I'm dreaming, right? 
You Ronnie Nash, right? 

334 
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,735 
- What is happening? 

335 
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:06,245 
- It was just a dream. 

336 
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:09,179 
- Everything? Are you calling me 
it was all a dream? 

337 
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,920 
- There was no child 
in the elevator. 
It's just ... 

338 
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:18,584 
... I believe that these 
mixing your feelings. 

339 
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:22,623 
- No, you do not understand ... 
"No, I understand, yes. 

340 
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:27,064 
- When Danny disappeared, 
I listened to mourn your 
all the time. 

341 
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,294 
- Disarming the whole house. 

342 
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,666 
- And then the child who 
followed in the shopping ... 

343 
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:34,571 
- I scared! 
- I thought it was Danny. 

344 
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:38,372 
- It seemed so 
Danny ... 

345 
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:41,106 
- He was identical to it, Paul! 
-Bryn, nor seemed ... 

346 
00:35:41,317 --> 00:35:43,877 
- It was like, yeah. 
- He did not looked like Danny! 

347 
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:55,594 
- Dr. Kirke warned us that we could 
move feel guilty. 

348 
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,828 
- And I want you to call her tomorrow ... 

349 
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,798 
... recommended for you 
any doctor in the city. 

350 
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:03,063 
- Paul, why are you doing this? 
- Bryn, Bryn. 

351 
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:06,242 
- We lost our son. 
We lost Danny. 

352 
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:09,037 
- And so, 
I almost lost you you ... 

353 
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:13,909 
... and I will not let it happen again. 
I will not let it happen! 

354 
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:17,077 
- You understand? 

355 
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,486 
- Is that I have fear. 

356 
00:36:21,758 --> 00:36:23,783 
- Of what? 

357 
00:36:23,993 --> 00:36:28,225 
- I should be attending, 
was my responsibility! 

358 
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:34,027 
- I have so much fear that Danny hates me! 
God! The hate me? 

359 
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:39,064 
- Our son hates me! 

360 
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:44,179 
- Please do not hate me! 

361 
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,871 
- He does not hate you, dear. 

362 
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:50,118 
- He can not hate you. 

363 
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:28,349 
- I love you. 

364 
00:37:55,218 --> 00:37:57,345 
- Oh, my God! 

365 
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:05,751 
- You know, appear to rescue 
is becoming a habit. 

366 
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:08,658 
- Very gallant. 
"Well, I'm new in town. 

367 
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,428 
- Where do you ride? 
- How about Colorado? 

368 
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:14,432 
- I have not ski. 

369 
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:16,468 
- Sorry, I have 
snow covers. 

370 
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:18,402 
- Then you can leave in the middle. 

371 
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:21,008 
- I must settle accounts 
to my agent. 

372 
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,200 
- Why? Have you done? 

373 
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:25,313 
- I intend to make the mother 
of a teenager in a commercial ... 

374 
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:27,642 
- Perhaps I have mother's face 
of a teenager? 

375 
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,716 
- How are you? 
Thirty? Thirty-one? 

376 
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:32,285 
- You are an amazing man 
perpicaz. 

377 
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:36,082 
- Astronomers are 
very observant. 
- I'll have to kiss you again. 

378 
00:38:45,435 --> 00:38:49,235 
- I hate when I have reason. 
- Not true! 

379 
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:53,438 
- Here is a report of 
Polícia of Peccadillo County. 

380 
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:54,837 
- How did you get? 

381 
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,512 
- Still I have some 
friends in the Department. 

382 
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:01,912 
- Our "Ms. False Alarm" 
Bryn Shaw, has a history. 

383 
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:04,177 
- She had a son. 
- "He"? 

384 
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,785 
- Yes, he disappeared. 
About three years will 
next Halloween. 

385 
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:10,957 
- It was given as drowning, 
but never found the body. 

386 
00:39:11,694 --> 00:39:14,629 
- It must have been hard for her 
and husband, then? 

387 
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:18,561 
- So call us now 
to report abuse of a child ... 

388 
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:21,259 
.. Who happened also is dead? 

389 
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:25,668 
- It sounds like remorse. 
"Kit, do not do this. 

390 
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,574 
- Do what? 
My job? 

391 
00:39:27,777 --> 00:39:32,009 
- You're not a detective. 
You came back to wear the uniform 
for a reason. 

392 
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:34,716 
- Something stinks here. 

393 
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:39,115 
- If you mess up again 
familiia other suffer. 

394 
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:43,320 
- And I think you can not 
live with it. 

395 
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,714 
- Where are you? 

396 
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:25,965 
- Oh, you crazy lady! 

397 
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,096 
- Gossip run. 

398 
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:31,432 
- Well, people in this building 
care should check their own lives. 

399 
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:33,799 
- So, you're not mad? 

400 
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:37,376 
- Totally. From head to toe. 
With certainty. 

401 
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,140 
- Well, I think the madness 
is underestimated. 

402 
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,045 
- Thanks. 
- Pass. 

403 
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:44,378 
- In fact, 
I need to do me a favor. 

404 
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:47,688 
- Going to speak well 
me your sister? 

405 
00:40:50,426 --> 00:40:51,426 
- Okay. 

406 
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:57,958 
-Mr. Butters, occurred again. 
"You shook the handle? 

407 
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:02,661 
- Yes, the shaken, the turn, rolled her. 
So I gave a little dance. 

408 
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:08,037 
- Well, let's fix that bathroom 
before you suffer under others! 

409 
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:48,217 
"Please send emails 
Nash, Rev. 418, a :.... 
Rev. B 2533 Gibson Street " 

410 
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:51,038 
- Mr. Nash? My name is Bryn Shaw. 
I live in the Beacon Building y. .. 

411 
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:57,578 
- Mr. Nash? Mr. Nash? 

412 
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,453 
- Mr. Nash? 

413 
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:17,970 
- Mr. Nash? 

414 
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,913 
- Sorry for the inconvenience ... 

415 
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:32,451 
... but wanted to ask 
about Ronnie. 

416 
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:35,780 
- You know about the game? 
Surfing in the elevator? 

417 
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:46,897 
- A neighbor said she heard screams 
coming from your apartment ... 

418 
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:52,439 
... and noise, as if someone 
was being beaten, 
and need to know ... 

419 
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,367 
- Mr. Nash? 

420 
00:43:56,445 --> 00:43:59,312 
- Mr. Nash, I just wanted to know ... 

421 
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:02,006 
- You hit your child? 

422 
00:44:02,218 --> 00:44:04,846 
- Ronnie was running 
you, Mr. Nash? 

423 
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:08,182 
So he was hiding 
in the elevator? 

424 
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,482 
- Mr. Nash, I need to know. 

425 
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:12,854 
- What was your child doing 
in the elevator shaft? 

426 
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:24,335 
- Mr. Nash! 

427 
00:44:34,617 --> 00:44:35,914 
"He is coming" 

428 
00:44:46,495 --> 00:44:49,293 
- Call the police a 
public phone ... 

429 
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:50,760 
... and said she was worried 
by a friend. 

430 
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:52,696 
- I do not know how 
could explain it. 

431 
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:55,063 
- They will find it, right? 
And will take care of it? 

432 
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:57,068 
- If, yes. 

433 
00:44:57,273 --> 00:44:58,865 
- You want to call Christina 
or your husband? 

434 
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:04,843 
- No, please. Because neither 
I know how to explain. 

435 
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,384 
- My God! 
dying alone and so! 

436 
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,213 
- It's hard to believe that 
whole family died. 

437 
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:15,656 
- What do you mean, the whole family? 

438 
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:18,619 
- The child, parent, and now the mother. 
All dead. 

439 
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:20,921 
- No, Ronnie's father was there. 

440 
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,860 
- Bryn, do not play well. 

441 
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,925 
- Why lie, Will? 
It was he who opened the door. 

442 
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:31,470 
- I do not know where it went. 
Not know how ... 

443 
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:33,373 
... he came out of that bathroom. 

444 
00:45:33,576 --> 00:45:35,476 
- Jim Nash died. 

445 
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,374 
- It happened here, just a week 
after the death of his son. 

446 
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:44,417 
- Mr. Nash took the sewing kit 
his wife, took out a scissor ... 

447 
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,056 
... I get the screw 
connects the two parts ... 

448 
00:45:48,357 --> 00:45:51,190 
... And one of the sheets, 
he cut his own throat. 

449 
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,290 
- No way. 

450 
00:45:54,497 --> 00:45:56,226 
- Thank you, Lieutenant. 

451 
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:58,400 
- Lt. Hutton adopted 
Beacon Building ... 

452 
00:45:58,601 --> 00:45:59,590 
... after what happened. 

453 
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:01,667 
- It's a good place. 

454 
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:06,035 
- People come, live, 
build their lives. 

455 
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:07,709 
- Most. 

456 
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,538 
- If the majority. 

457 
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:50,274 
- Take me to bed. 

458 
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:15,101 
- I'm not mistaken. 
Not this time. 

459 
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:45,662 
- Mail, Professor Paul! 

460 
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:51,901 
- Department of Science Festival? 

461 
00:48:52,107 --> 00:48:53,335 
- Yes, I do every semester. 

462 
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:55,601 
- For students and 
teachers have 
opportunity ... 

463 
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,439 
... fun together. 

464 
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:03,952 
- It will be Halloween. 
"Yes, that's the good part. 

465 
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:09,847 
- Because it is a folk tradition? 
"No, women in disguise. 

466 
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:13,222 
- They're hot. 
As I was told. 

467 
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:16,989 
- Bryn hates Halloween. 

468 
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,071 
- Look, I know this ... 

469 
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:28,004 
- Hey, we need to take 
a normal life, remember? 

470 
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,646 
- Even so, sorry. 
- You look very handsome. 

471 
00:49:32,448 --> 00:49:33,779 
- Hey, buddy. 

472 
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:35,416 
- Reinforcements! 

473 
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:39,712 
- You look fantastic. 
- Thanks for the invitation. 

474 
00:49:39,922 --> 00:49:42,254 
- Interesting costume for 
a financial analyst. 

475 
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:46,017 
- And the scientist says 
Dress magician! 

476 
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:53,164 
- What? 

477 
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:56,099 
- I remembered something I said 
on women in disguise. 

478 
00:50:22,298 --> 00:50:25,825 
- ... That particular issue, no ... 

479 
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:28,133 
- Thanks. 

480 
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:33,704 
- Well, I like everything 
related to the holidays. 

481 
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,433 
- I know ... 

482 
00:50:39,682 --> 00:50:42,082 
- Darling. 
- Thanks, dear. 

483 
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:43,410 
- Sure. 

484 
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:44,608 
- Look at them. 

485 
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:49,314 
- ... collision with a Ford, 
and only got ... 

486 
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:50,617 
- Better go rescue them. 

487 
00:50:50,826 --> 00:50:53,021 
- Ah, no, no. Stay here 
and make your contacts ... 

488 
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:55,719 
... Share with your colleagues. 
I'll take care of that. 

489 
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:58,798 
- Are you sure? 
- Claro. Abracadabra! 

490 
00:51:01,704 --> 00:51:03,501 
- Esses is my point: 
everything is cyclical. 

491 
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:07,540 
... The earth revolves around the sun, 
blood flows through our body. 

492 
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:10,610 
... the water evaporates, returns as rain 
and evaporated again. 

493 
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,440 
- As my patience. 

494 
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:16,607 
- So if we have physical cyclic 
why not a cyclical paraphysical? 

495 
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:18,286 
- Type something supernatural? 

496 
00:51:18,487 --> 00:51:20,148 
- No, no, everything belongs 
the natural world ... 

497 
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:23,086 
- Nothing can be "supernatural." 
Maybe out of the ordinary ... 

498 
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:27,160 
... unusual. We die 
we become pure consciousness, o. .. 

499 
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:28,853 
- Ghosts? 

500 
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:31,056 
- Spirits, more precisely. 

501 
00:51:31,266 --> 00:51:33,564 
- Or "soul" if you 
parateológico brain. 

502 
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:35,828 
- Ghosts are different 
dealing with minor cycles. 

503 
00:51:36,071 --> 00:51:41,031 
- Why are not talking? 
I'll give you a ride. 

504 
00:51:45,581 --> 00:51:50,644 
- I think I was annoying. 
- Maybe a little anxious. 

505 
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:52,753 
- Professor Valencia 
I'm Bryn Shaw. I am the ... 

506 
00:51:52,955 --> 00:51:56,447 
- The wife of Paul! Should have 
recognized by the holder portrait! 

507 
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:59,059 
- He looks pretty 
- Really? 

508 
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:04,754 
- You said that ghosts 
cycles occupy less ... 

509 
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,198 
- You ... you think 
they exist? 

510 
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:11,567 
- I think it always pays 
worth asking. 
Why? 

511 
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:17,769 
- You saw the two appearances? 

512 
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,074 
- The child, several times. 
The father, only once. 

513 
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:23,444 
- In the apartment of the mother? 
- Yes. It was very strange ... 

514 
00:52:23,652 --> 00:52:27,281 
... had several scissors 
hung on the walls. 

515 
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:32,216 
- They were open, so? 

516 
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,325 
- Yes, exactly. 

517 
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,988 
- The scissors is a cross 
to ward off evil spirits. 

518 
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,829 
- I think it worked. 
- The cross is a symbol of faith. 

519 
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,904 
- If you need more of them 
because they do not think enough. 

520 
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:47,575 
- I think the boy was 
seeking help from her mother ... 

521 
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:50,472 
... and the father followed him. 

522 
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:55,915 
- As I said, it appears that 
Nash dominated the life of your child. 

523 
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:58,551 
- Your spirit can follow 
dominate in death. 

524 
00:52:58,754 --> 00:53:00,813 
- So, you think of me? 

525 
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,026 
- Was I lying about? 
- Could be disrupted. 

526 
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:08,321 
- The disturbance can cause 
chemical changes in the brain. 

527 
00:53:08,664 --> 00:53:10,757 
- The ghosts are 
a symptom of the imbalance ... 

528 
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:13,662 
... disturbance or leaves it 
attuned to their world? 

529 
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:19,565 
- How I can release the child? 

530 
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:22,243 
- And because he thinks I should try? 

531 
00:53:22,444 --> 00:53:27,245 
- Because it's just a kid ... 
lost, scared. 

532 
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:31,044 
- Parent, no. Appearances 
suicide are dangerous. 

533 
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:32,150 
- There is so much hatred. 

534 
00:53:32,354 --> 00:53:35,380 
- For many years, suicide 
was considered a mortal sin. 

535 
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:38,583 
- The suicide could not be buried 
on holy ground nor enter into Heaven. 

536 
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:42,262 
- They were buried at night, 
secret, at the crossroads ... 

537 
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:44,728 
... where criminals and witches 
were buried. 

538 
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,491 
- Look. 

539 
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:48,794 
- Literally nailed 
the drawer with stakes ... 

540 
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:51,370 
... Not to be lifted. 
- Like vampires. 

541 
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:53,564 
- There came 
the vampire myth. 

542 
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:55,471 
- As a vampire, it was believed 
the ghost of a suicide ... 

543 
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:58,077 
could take 
a corporeal form. 

544 
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:00,811 
- Corporal? You mean ...? 

545 
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:04,975 
- Meat. A reminder of life 
that was wasted. 

546 
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:09,347 
- Everyone dies. 

547 
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:12,584 
- Death is inevitable: 
self-destruction, no. 

548 
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:17,388 
- Neither indifference. 

549 
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:22,865 
- It mantedrá away from father? 
- I promise. 

550 
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:26,797 
- Please, just tell me 
and free the child. 

551 
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:31,204 
- Both are imprisoned in a cycle 
of abuse and guilt. 

552 
00:54:31,413 --> 00:54:34,143 
- Break the cycle before he arrives 
at its most traumatic. 

553 
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:35,577 
- That would be the fall of the boy. 

554 
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:37,684 
- But be careful not 
reinforce the trauma ... 

555 
00:54:37,886 --> 00:54:40,150 
... or be trapped forever. 

556 
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:44,825 
- Simon? 

557 
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:48,326 
- If I break the cycle and assist 
the boy to make the passage ... 

558 
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,761 
... He could ...? 

559 
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:55,966 
- What? 

560 
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,230 
- He could take a message? 

561 
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:13,481 
- Someone was mixing 
came with the medication. 

562 
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:16,791 
- It's good to be alive. 

563 
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:27,124 
- Hello, Mrs. Shaw. 
- Hello, Paul. 

564 
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:46,444 
- Bryn? 

565 
00:55:46,655 --> 00:55:48,816 
- I'm tired. 

566 
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,144 
- It was so embarrassing 
occurred in the elevator last night. 

567 
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,218 
- I do not suppose you told 
your wife about me. 

568 
00:58:01,656 --> 00:58:04,181 
- "About You" would be 
exaggerate the situation. 

569 
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:08,227 
- Poor Lancelot! She forced you 
to sleep on the couch? 

570 
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:13,894 
- Vamos! I did not know 
I was a secret. 

571 
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,431 
- Nothing important, at least. 
- What do you mean? 

572 
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:23,839 
- Discretion should be mandatory 
for someone in your field. 

573 
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,320 
- Looks like someone was 
research on the Internet. 

574 
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:38,015 
- It was good to flirt with a star 
decadent, but not with depraved. 

575 
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,594 
- I was not flirting with you. 

576 
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:51,668 
- Just need someone 
I may go to work. 

577 
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:00,705 
- Sign. 

578 
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:13,020 
- If I break the cycle and assist 
the boy to make the passage ... 

579 
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:16,523 
- He could take a message? 

580 
00:59:18,967 --> 00:59:20,958 
- Tell ... 

581 
00:59:24,706 --> 00:59:27,607 
... I'm very sorry. 

582 
00:59:32,347 --> 00:59:36,681 
- Tell him I love, 
I love him so much ... 

583 
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:43,314 
- Tell him to give 
my life ... 

584 
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:47,393 
... my life 
just to see him again. 

585 
00:59:49,664 --> 00:59:54,533 
... Just for a moment ... 
Just to see him again. 

586 
00:59:57,572 --> 01:00:03,841 
- Tell him I'm sorry! 
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! 

587 
01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:26,392 
- Professor, I got information 
about our ghost hunt. 

588 
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:28,660 
- Still not investigate 
the story of his building. 

589 
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:30,929 
- In cases of apparitions, 
Most importantly is the place ... 

590 
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:32,697 
... but in this case it is necessary ... 

591 
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:36,139 
... since we have the luxury of knowing 
when they started 
the INDICATED ... 

592 
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:37,174 
- What are you talking about? 

593 
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:40,507 
- Instead investigate 
such as expelling a ghost. 

594 
01:00:40,715 --> 01:00:42,342 
.. ruling out a formal exorcism ... 

595 
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:44,849 
... since the Catholic Church 
was more selective ... 

596 
01:00:45,053 --> 01:00:46,714 
... from that movie 
with green vomit. 

597 
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:49,390 
- Simon ... 
- But it is much folklore 
less elitist. 

598 
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:51,183 
- Then, if we 
a piece of clothing ... 

599 
01:00:51,393 --> 01:00:53,122 
Nash 
or your child ... 

600 
01:00:53,328 --> 01:00:55,262 
... could make a thread 
giving 7 knots ... 

601 
01:00:55,463 --> 01:00:57,260 
... and burn. Hence the ghost 
would be forced to return ... 

602 
01:00:57,465 --> 01:00:59,057 
- What ghost? 

603 
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:01,502 
- Ops! 

604 
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:05,169 
- You've been talking to 
my wife about ghosts? 

605 
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:07,568 
- James and Ronald Nash. 

606 
01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:09,673 
- Find some newspapers 
they say that ... 

607 
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:11,436 
- Enough! For that! 

608 
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:14,615 
- My wife is 
under medical treatment. 

609 
01:01:14,816 --> 01:01:17,546 
- She is sick, and need not 
your leave it worse. 

610 
01:01:17,919 --> 01:01:18,908 
- But she seek. 

611 
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,111 
- And you did not see 
I was disturbed? 

612 
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:28,886 
- You are a tremendous desatre. 

613 
01:01:44,012 --> 01:01:46,606 
- Nothing I say will change. 

614 
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:49,079 
- Nothing I say will change. 

615 
01:01:49,284 --> 01:01:52,481 
- Nothing I say will change. 

616 
01:02:35,563 --> 01:02:37,758 
- No one here? 

617 
01:02:39,534 --> 01:02:42,332 
- The job ends at 5. 

618 
01:02:56,284 --> 01:03:01,153 
- We raised videos on the Internet, 
we do photo shoots. 

619 
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:03,982 
- It's not pornography. 

620 
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:09,824 
- No need to justify yourself. 
"I do not. The Porn pay more. 

621 
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,461 
- In addition, so do not need 
take off my clothes ... 

622 
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:16,967 
... to which I sometimes 
forced in Hollywood. 

623 
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:23,741 
- Why did you come here, Paul? 
- I came to apologize. 

624 
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:26,410 
- Really? 

625 
01:03:26,614 --> 01:03:30,243 
- I know how it feels to be 
caught in a difficult situation. 

626 
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,215 
... listening to others 
judging. 

627 
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:38,751 
- I had no right. 

628 
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:42,320 
- It is very noble of you. 

629 
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:50,362 
- Not really understand 
the grace of all this ... 

630 
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:52,597 
... but that should not affect 
the way I treat you. 

631 
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:56,800 
- You do not understand grace is this? 
"No, I do not understand. 

632 
01:04:11,526 --> 01:04:13,460 
- Vanessa ... 

633 
01:04:13,661 --> 01:04:19,725 
- You understand the grace, Paul. 
Grace is to have control. 

634 
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,369 
- I did not come here for that. 

635 
01:04:25,573 --> 01:04:30,101 
- No? I have asked you 
apologies in the building. 

636 
01:04:34,682 --> 01:04:38,778 
- I'm going. 
- Too late. I'm stuck. 

637 
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:41,888 
- I can leave here, Paul. 

638 
01:04:43,825 --> 01:04:47,522 
- Paul! Paul, wait! 

639 
01:04:49,464 --> 01:04:51,625 
- Paul, please! 

640 
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:56,797 
- I can not let go, Paul! 
I'm helpless! 

641 
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,364 
- Paul? 

642 
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:01,174 
- Why are you doing this? 

643 
01:05:01,376 --> 01:05:05,335 
- You said you understand how 
it feels to be trapped. 
Who caught you? 

644 
01:05:05,547 --> 01:05:07,447 
- Nobody. 
I was not talking about me. 

645 
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:12,143 
- I am prey. 
I can not let go. 

646 
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:15,083 
- I am helpless, Paul. 

647 
01:05:23,932 --> 01:05:27,129 
- Wives are false. 
Toys for the camera. 

648 
01:05:27,335 --> 01:05:30,498 
- To be imprisoned is just ... 
- An illusion. 

649 
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,826 
- Where were you? 

650 
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:09,367 
- What happened? 
Where is Bryn? 

651 
01:07:10,004 --> 01:07:12,973 
- I came to visit Ty, 
but stop by here before. 

652 
01:07:13,174 --> 01:07:15,540 
- She was lying in the bath 
babbling about Danny ... 

653 
01:07:15,743 --> 01:07:17,870 
... and a guy named Ronnie. 

654 
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:20,837 
- I gave him sedatives and lay down. 

655 
01:07:21,149 --> 01:07:23,276 
- I was afraid that 
was hurt. 

656 
01:07:23,484 --> 01:07:25,145 
- You did the right thing. 

657 
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:29,049 
- I know. 
But it should have been me. 

658 
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:40,225 
- Sorry you had 
to bother. 

659 
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:46,404 
- It will not happen again. 

660 
01:07:57,218 --> 01:08:00,676 
- You can not leave you alone. 
Bryn What is happening is ... 

661 
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:05,052 
- What is happening Bryn! 
How could I forget? 

662 
01:08:05,259 --> 01:08:06,988 
- Do not be selfish! 

663 
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,730 
- I lost my son. 

664 
01:08:11,933 --> 01:08:15,699 
- My son disappeared 
 and probably dead. 

665 
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,733 
- And I can not even mourn for him. 

666 
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:20,931 
- I can show my pain ... 

667 
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:23,939 
... I stay calm 
and support ... 

668 
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:27,376 
... but lose 
 my wife also. 

669 
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:29,674 
- Listen, I know ... 
- No! 

670 
01:08:30,752 --> 01:08:31,980 
- You do not know. 

671 
01:08:32,186 --> 01:08:34,984 
- You stayed with us 
 3 weeks after 
 the first attempt. 

672 
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:38,852 
- I live 3 years ago 
 counting pills, hiding scissors ... 

673 
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,324 
... Knives hiding, hiding ... 
- Your anger? 

674 
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:44,130 
- Well, she should have 
better care, right? 

675 
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:50,098 
- I said it once. 
- But that's what you think, Paul. 

676 
01:08:50,304 --> 01:08:54,331 
- That she did not care. 
"No, I do not think so. 

677 
01:08:54,742 --> 01:08:58,075 
- But sometimes I like to ... 

678 
01:09:00,748 --> 01:09:03,182 
... to take care of itself. 

679 
01:09:04,452 --> 01:09:07,080 
- And also me. 

680 
01:09:07,288 --> 01:09:10,780 
- She is in a limbo, Paul. 
She is trapped. 

681 
01:09:10,992 --> 01:09:15,326 
- You have no idea of power 
that gives a person 
 being trapped. 

682 
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:23,069 
- You know, when my girlfriend started 
 to talk about being cornered ... 

683 
01:09:24,005 --> 01:09:27,839 
... was usually because they had 
 made some stupidity. 

684 
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:31,603 
- You're really angry, right Paul? 

685 
01:09:34,982 --> 01:09:37,678 
- You must learn to hide 
better. 

686 
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,035 
- Ground floor, please. 

687 
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:32,463 
- We need to know 
 Health Insurance Plan ... 

688 
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:35,329 
... or the person being 
responsible for paying the bill. 

689 
01:11:35,536 --> 01:11:38,403 
- We can see that count? 
- No, sir. I need it now. 

690 
01:11:38,606 --> 01:11:41,200 
- Put my name. 
Paul Shaw. 

691 
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:46,407 
- After we solve the rest. 
She is from the family. 

692 
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:57,583 
- Bryn, we go home. 
- I can not. 

693 
01:11:57,925 --> 01:12:00,485 
- They will call us ... 
if anything changes. 

694 
01:12:03,664 --> 01:12:07,623 
- I do not know what is real, 
since we moved there. 

695 
01:12:09,737 --> 01:12:14,470 
- But what happened to Chrissy 
is real, and I stay with her. 

696 
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:18,376 
- And I need you by my side. 

697 
01:12:19,647 --> 01:12:21,774 
- And the department 
 and everything else? 

698 
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:27,244 
- Everything went wrong, I do not know why. 
I know we have a contract ... 

699 
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:28,405 
- No matter the contract. 

700 
01:12:32,793 --> 01:12:34,988 
- We were better, Bryn. 
We felt better ... 

701 
01:12:35,196 --> 01:12:38,461 
... But the move, 
 we started a. .. 

702 
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:42,894 
- Get out of there. 
- How? 

703 
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:45,095 
- Let's get out of there. 

704 
01:12:45,306 --> 01:12:47,001 
- Let's stay in the apartment 
Christina. 

705 
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,766 
- We will stay in his apartment 
is closer to the hospital ... 

706 
01:12:48,976 --> 01:12:52,776 
... we stay with it. 
We will be moving today. 

707 
01:12:54,882 --> 01:12:57,476 
- Okay? I go to school ... 

708 
01:12:57,685 --> 01:13:00,245 
... find someone to take 
my classes for a few days. 

709 
01:13:00,454 --> 01:13:04,220 
- You go home and pack your bags. 

710 
01:13:06,494 --> 01:13:11,227 
- I love you. 
Not survive without you. 

711 
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:16,267 
- Everything will be fine. 

712 
01:13:32,753 --> 01:13:35,017 
- We're going. 

713 
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:51,361 
- Thanks, Mr. Director. 
I appreciate that. 

714 
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:55,205 
- I'm sure if Mr 
Thanks. 

715 
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:56,535 
- Paul! 

716 
01:13:56,744 --> 01:13:59,338 
- I cut, Mr. Director. 
Ty, you're doing here? 

717 
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:00,707 
- I knew what happened to Chrissy. 

718 
01:14:00,915 --> 01:14:03,213 
- I went to the hospital, 
but let me see her. 

719 
01:14:12,059 --> 01:14:13,822 
- Karasic. 

720 
01:14:14,528 --> 01:14:17,053 
- You received the call 
the hospital, sir? 

721 
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:22,161 
- I knew you were doing 
Bryn questions about Shaw and her husband. 

722 
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,099 
- Yes, sir. 

723 
01:14:24,605 --> 01:14:27,267 
- As we make a visit. 

724 
01:14:28,142 --> 01:14:30,110 
- No family 
can have such bad luck. 

725 
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:33,769 
- I will call my partner. 
We find there. 

726 
01:14:54,068 --> 01:14:55,433 
- Only allow relatives. 

727 
01:14:55,636 --> 01:14:58,969 
- Call your department, 
but nobody answers. 

728 
01:14:59,173 --> 01:15:01,437 
- We were with her. 

729 
01:15:01,642 --> 01:15:03,872 
- I came here because 
do not know what to do. 

730 
01:15:07,915 --> 01:15:09,041 
 - Professor Paul? 
- Simon! 

731 
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,047 
- I should not have ... 
"Who is this? 

732 
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:12,310 
- Paul! 
- Who is this? 

733 
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,080 
- Calm down, man! 
- This is James Nash. 

734 
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:19,225 
- James Nash! He committed suicide. 
- When? When was that? 

735 
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:23,295 
- About six or seven months, after 
that his son fell into the elevator shaft. 

736 
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:28,259 
- I saw him. 

737 
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:30,699 
- When we moved 
the building, I saw it. 

738 
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:33,631 
- You see it? 
- In the parking lot ... 

739 
01:15:33,841 --> 01:15:35,934 
... was behind a woman 
a neighbor. 

740 
01:15:36,143 --> 01:15:39,579 
- No way! 
- I saw him. 

741 
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:44,250 
- He appeared to you, also to Bryn, 
and that other neighboring ... 

742 
01:15:45,553 --> 01:15:47,180 
- It's the one who is asking for help. 

743 
01:15:47,388 --> 01:15:51,347 
- The child's dominant 
dangerous. 

744 
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:53,986 
- Your wife is in danger. 

745 
01:16:05,973 --> 01:16:07,201 
- Ronnie? 

746 
01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:09,971 
- She wanted to break the ICFI 
and Iiberar the child ... 

747 
01:16:10,177 --> 01:16:13,112 
... but hate the child was 
I believe in the cycle. 

748 
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:15,282 
- I told her that 
 not to mess with suicide. 

749 
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:18,816 
- Suicide? No, the child's death 
was accidental. He fell, right? 

750 
01:16:19,186 --> 01:16:21,620 
- And if the leap? 
- To escape from the father? 

751 
01:16:22,056 --> 01:16:26,390 
- What difference would it? 
- In an appearance? You have no idea. 

752 
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:34,694 
- Explicame. 

753 
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,937 
 - Ronnie? Ronnie? 

754 
01:16:39,173 --> 01:16:40,606 
- Ronnie? 

755 
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:43,105 
- Please let me help. 

756 
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:47,874 
- I also had a son. 
His name was ... 

757 
01:16:49,316 --> 01:16:51,216 
... was ... 

758 
01:16:52,186 --> 01:16:53,813 
- His name is Daniel. 

759 
01:16:54,021 --> 01:16:55,215 
- Mama? 

760 
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:57,624 
- Danny? 

761 
01:16:57,825 --> 01:17:02,489 
- Look at me, Mom! 
Look at me! 
- Okay, honey. Okay. 

762 
01:17:02,696 --> 01:17:05,164 
- No! No! 
- No, Danny! 

763 
01:17:05,633 --> 01:17:07,931 
- Ronnie ... 
- He is coming! He is coming! 

764 
01:17:08,135 --> 01:17:12,435 
- No! Please! 
Please open! 

765 
01:17:23,851 --> 01:17:26,979 
- Suicides were fixed 
stakes in their graves ... 

766 
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:30,453 
... with a stone on the face 
or chains around his head. 

767 
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:34,023 
- Chains around his head? 
- That they will not be lifted. 

768 
01:17:34,228 --> 01:17:36,321 
- You said Bryn 
was under medical care. 

769 
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,657 
- Please tell me she 
not suicidal. 

770 
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:41,429 
- Why? 

771 
01:17:41,635 --> 01:17:43,694 
- Creatures with her 
is dealing, Nash and his son ... 

772 
01:17:43,904 --> 01:17:45,166 
... only know the anguish. 

773 
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:46,703 
- And the only way they 
to reduce your pain ... 

774 
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:50,468 
... is seducing other 
to follow suit. 

775 
01:18:03,524 --> 01:18:05,048 
- Ronnie? 

776 
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:14,696 
- Ronnie, I will not hurt. 

777 
01:18:20,774 --> 01:18:21,968 
- You did? 

778 
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:23,643 
- Do not serve. 

779 
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:28,012 
- Let me talk 
with Danny again. 

780 
01:18:30,117 --> 01:18:32,210 
- No, no. 

781 
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:35,988 
- Danny ... you're there, Danny? 

782 
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:38,488 
- He is coming. 

783 
01:18:42,096 --> 01:18:43,495 
- Danny? 

784 
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:46,830 
- Look at me. 

785 
01:18:47,534 --> 01:18:49,024 
- No! No! 

786 
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:52,531 
- No, Danny! No! 

787 
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:58,201 
- No! Again no, please! 

788 
01:19:00,381 --> 01:19:02,315 
- Please let me wake up! 

789 
01:19:02,516 --> 01:19:04,575 
- Let me wake up! 
- Let me wake up! 

790 
01:19:04,785 --> 01:19:06,116 
- Let me wake up! 

791 
01:19:06,553 --> 01:19:08,316 
- Find sometHing in the records! 

792 
01:19:08,522 --> 01:19:11,650 
- Before Building 
Beacon was the Beacon Hotel. 

793 
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:13,690 
- And, before that, was 
Hosted by the Beacon Street. 

794 
01:19:13,894 --> 01:19:14,918 
- And that has to do with us? 

795 
01:19:15,129 --> 01:19:18,724 
- Before that, he was the street corner 
Beacon Avenue to Church! 

796 
01:19:19,233 --> 01:19:22,532 
- A crossroads! Where victims 
suicide were buried. 

797 
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:24,101 
- Then The Beacon 
is on a graveyard? 

798 
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:25,294 
- A deposit of bodies. 

799 
01:19:25,506 --> 01:19:26,871 
- Then, when the child 
committed suicide ...? 

800 
01:19:27,074 --> 01:19:28,939 
- The trigger that. 

801 
01:19:30,077 --> 01:19:32,307 
- God helps those who mess with that! 

802 
01:19:42,623 --> 01:19:44,523 
- Hello, darling. 

803 
01:19:44,725 --> 01:19:46,955 
- Paul and I are going ... 

804 
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:49,629 
... and I would like you 
do the same, Ms. Carver. 

805 
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:54,132 
- Considering all that we share, 
 you should call me Vanessa. 

806 
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:12,478 
- That's ... 

807 
01:20:15,556 --> 01:20:18,423 
- That's disgusting. 
- Really? 

808 
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:21,627 
- I think it's very sexy. 

809 
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,924 
- I know someone who also believes it. 

810 
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:46,374 
- Paul? Paul? 
- Almost there. 

811 
01:20:47,287 --> 01:20:49,949 
- It was very easy. 
To control ... 

812 
01:20:50,157 --> 01:20:52,352 
... coarse convince 
that I was helpless. 

813 
01:20:54,294 --> 01:20:56,285 
- Paul would not do that, 
the no ... 

814 
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,959 
- Not what? 
- He does not leave me alone. 

815 
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:08,106 
- Ah, my dear, people like us 
 are always alone. 

816 
01:21:18,419 --> 01:21:19,408 
- These wrong. 

817 
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:27,954 
- Fast! 
We do not have much time! 

818 
01:21:29,763 --> 01:21:31,993 
- Paul, does not open! 

819 
01:21:32,633 --> 01:21:34,498 
- Stay in the car! 

820 
01:21:34,701 --> 01:21:35,998 
- Do not turn off. 

821 
01:21:36,203 --> 01:21:38,364 
- Paul, does not open! 

822 
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:43,903 
- Did you see that ...? Caramba! 

823 
01:21:44,111 --> 01:21:47,410 
- He does not want to go up. 
Something is happening! 

824 
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:51,709 
- Call the police! Go through the basement. 
4O9 apartment. 

825 
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:55,814 
- What will I say? 
- Tell my wife is in danger. 

826 
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:09,702 
- And who are you? 

827 
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:16,739 
- Came from the university ... 

828 
01:22:16,944 --> 01:22:19,708 
... when we reached the parking lot 
try taking the elevator ... 

829 
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:23,246 
... and saw a child 
just not a child. 

830 
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:24,940 
- Really? 

831 
01:22:25,786 --> 01:22:27,413 
- And you think you saw? 

832 
01:22:29,456 --> 01:22:32,584 
- Are the Shaw! 
- Okay. Stay calm. 

833 
01:22:32,793 --> 01:22:34,886 
- Damn, Bob! 
- Kit? 

834 
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,264 
- You were a good man! 

835 
01:22:38,465 --> 01:22:41,662 
- How could you be so selfish 
to lose against someone like me? 

836 
01:22:41,902 --> 01:22:47,135 
- What happened between you two ... 
We can fix it. 

837 
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:51,334 
- We forget. 
We can forget you. 

838 
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,778 
- Impossible, Bryn. 
You do not want to forget. 

839 
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:59,376 
- You do not want to forget ... 

840 
01:23:01,154 --> 01:23:02,746 
- ... us. 

841 
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:12,384 
- Kit .. Kit .. 

842 
01:23:19,072 --> 01:23:22,098 
- This is not anything right! 

843 
01:23:28,048 --> 01:23:31,313 
- And, Bryn? 
Do not look delicious? 

844 
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:33,179 
- You can not be ... 

845 
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:38,654 
- Dead? Ah, my dear, 
we are all dead here. 

846 
01:23:38,926 --> 01:23:42,828 
- Son, I think it's time to go. 

847 
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:47,760 
- It's all the building! 

848 
01:23:48,602 --> 01:23:51,002 
- God! Is the entire building. 

849 
01:23:51,204 --> 01:23:53,502 
- Son, you're talking about? 

850 
01:23:53,974 --> 01:23:56,568 
- Officer, who knows about this place? 

851 
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:59,005 
Knows how many suicides occurred here? 

852 
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:01,575 
- Many. 

853 
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:11,920 
- Bobby, respond! Bobby! 

854 
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:13,217 
- What the hell?! 

855 
01:24:13,427 --> 01:24:15,691 
- Kit .. 
- Bobby, respond! 

856 
01:24:16,196 --> 01:24:19,495 
- Bobby? Answers! 
- He can not hear you ... 

857 
01:24:20,133 --> 01:24:23,000 
- He does not know that you are here. 

858 
01:24:29,276 --> 01:24:31,574 
- Let me alone! 
Let me alone! 

859 
01:24:31,778 --> 01:24:34,542 
- Honey, you cried unto 
we came to you. 

860 
01:24:34,881 --> 01:24:37,179 
- The only thing I think is 
 to complete your life. 

861 
01:24:37,384 --> 01:24:40,444 
- We are butterflies 
attracted by your light. 
- You're all I have, dear. 

862 
01:24:40,821 --> 01:24:43,221 
- You are our beacon (beacon). 
- Not true! Not true! 

863 
01:24:43,423 --> 01:24:46,358 
- Vives distraught 
your husband betrayed you ... 

864 
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,860 
... and you ... you lost 
your son ... 

865 
01:24:55,102 --> 01:24:57,400 
... forever. 

866 
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:19,887 
- Where do you think that you, boy? 

867 
01:25:25,032 --> 01:25:27,694 
- You think you know about us? 

868 
01:25:29,736 --> 01:25:33,001 
- Come to us ... 

869 
01:25:37,544 --> 01:25:39,011 
- Police! 

870 
01:25:40,147 --> 01:25:42,206 
- I want to see Danny ... 

871 
01:25:42,482 --> 01:25:44,609 
- I want to see Danny again ... 

872 
01:25:44,818 --> 01:25:46,752 
Once again, please ... 

873 
01:25:46,953 --> 01:25:49,581 
- Yes, dear ... 

874 
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:53,682 
... have exactly what you want. 

875 
01:25:53,927 --> 01:25:55,588 
- All we had. 

876 
01:26:09,443 --> 01:26:11,775 
- Drive a stake into his grave. 

877 
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:15,011 
- Drive a stake into his grave. 

878 
01:26:15,782 --> 01:26:17,841 
- Drive a stake into his grave. 

879 
01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:24,252 
- He's coming. 

880 
01:26:30,564 --> 01:26:34,159 
- You can not save it, Paul. 
Now it is ours. 

881 
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:36,335 
- Vanessa? 

882 
01:26:41,908 --> 01:26:46,538 
- Are you one of them! You are ... 
"Say, Paul! A ghost. 

883 
01:26:46,747 --> 01:26:50,945 
- Dressed in a body 
a body that feels. 

884 
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:53,483 
- But that was what 
 all were looking for here. 

885 
01:26:55,355 --> 01:26:57,550 
- Bryn is what you want. 

886 
01:26:58,058 --> 01:26:59,286 
- No! 

887 
01:27:00,794 --> 01:27:03,592 
- No pain, no joy ... 

888 
01:27:03,797 --> 01:27:07,528 
... no reason to scream 
but we are crying ... 

889 
01:27:07,734 --> 01:27:09,793 
... forever. 

890 
01:27:11,171 --> 01:27:13,605 
- Let her out of here, please. 

891 
01:27:14,975 --> 01:27:16,670 
- No, we then need. 

892 
01:27:16,877 --> 01:27:19,277 
- Why? 
"Because she still feels. 

893 
01:27:20,013 --> 01:27:21,878 
- And, at the time 
in which she cut ... 

894 
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:28,282 
... at that moment of agony delicious 
 We feel with her. 

895 
01:27:28,488 --> 01:27:30,285 
- And you condemn her for that? 

896 
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:33,015 
- I would condemn a 
fraction of the time. 

897 
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,888 
- I do not really feel anything? 

898 
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:39,694 
- So this is just for me. 

899 
01:27:51,244 --> 01:27:53,804 
- I lied when I said 
that prison is an illusion. 

900 
01:27:56,683 --> 01:28:00,050 
- She is already ours. 
You no longer need. 

901 
01:28:00,253 --> 01:28:02,346 
- No need to go there. 

902 
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:05,519 
- I love her. 

903 
01:28:08,662 --> 01:28:10,562 
- Poor Lancelot. 

904 
01:28:10,831 --> 01:28:15,063 
- Boy! Sal! 

905 
01:28:15,268 --> 01:28:18,169 
- Get out of where you are! 

906 
01:28:32,085 --> 01:28:35,248 
- Drive a stake 
 - Drive a stake into his grave. 


907 
01:28:46,499 --> 01:28:47,329 
- Tyler. 

908 
01:28:47,534 --> 01:28:50,401 
- She is ours now, Paul! 
"We trust you. 

909 
01:28:50,604 --> 01:28:52,595 
- You gave back 
 and lost. 

910 
01:29:23,169 --> 01:29:25,729 
- You can bring me back? 

911 
01:29:26,606 --> 01:29:28,130 
- No, son. 

912 
01:29:28,341 --> 01:29:30,639 
- You just gonna die. 

913 
01:30:10,317 --> 01:30:11,750 
- Bryn, no! No! 

914 
01:30:11,952 --> 01:30:15,979 
- Danny! I want to see Danny! 

915 
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,960 
- I want to see Danny! 
- You can not! He was! 

916 
01:30:32,172 --> 01:30:33,469 
- He died! 
- Stop! 

917 
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:44,801 
- Calm down, Kit 
Calm down. 

918 
01:31:48,348 --> 01:31:50,475 
- Your weapon, Officer. 

919 
01:32:04,297 --> 01:32:06,561 
- I found 
my partner? 

920 
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:07,630 
- I'm not crazy! 

921 
01:32:07,834 --> 01:32:09,301 
- We came together! 
I'm not crazy! 

922 
01:32:09,502 --> 01:32:11,732 
Here again ...! 

923 
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:15,230 
- Quiet. Let 
find your companion. 

924 
01:32:15,442 --> 01:32:18,570 
- Those damned detectives me 
treated as if he were crazy. 

925 
01:32:19,746 --> 01:32:21,976 
- I thought he was going to kill her. 

926 
01:32:22,315 --> 01:32:24,977 
- I thought he was going to kill her. 

927 
01:32:25,685 --> 01:32:27,846 
- Do not worry. 

928 
01:32:49,075 --> 01:32:51,635 
- All is well. 

929 
01:32:52,612 --> 01:32:56,548 
- All is well. 
We take care of you. 

930 
01:33:37,657 --> 01:33:39,454 
- I love you. 

931 
01:33:58,811 --> 01:34:01,939 
- What am I doing here? 

932 
01:34:11,524 --> 01:34:13,890 
- Sorry. 

933 
01:34:15,128 --> 01:34:18,655 
- I'm so sorry. 

934 
01:34:24,971 --> 01:34:27,462 
- I would give my life to change this. 

935 
01:34:27,674 --> 01:34:29,938 
- To go back. 

936 
01:34:43,122 --> 01:34:45,454 
- Everything will be fine.
