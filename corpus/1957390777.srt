1
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,200
Now this is more like it.

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,210
Relatively safe, quiet.

3
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,210
Quiet?
It's a ghost town.

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,210
It's the off season.

5
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,210
Look how peaceful this is.
You're going to be missing
this after Memorial Day

6
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,720
when the place is
crawling with tourists.

7
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Maybe.

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I just hope
someone's hiring.

9
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,730
Yeah. Start slowing up
'cause we should be
coming up to it.

10
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,730
What's the address?

11
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,230
Uh, it's the Viking Motel.

12
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,230
We're living in a motel?

13
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,240
Oh, yeah. They rent out
long term when there's
no tourists around.

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,740
There it is.
There it is.

15
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,250
At least we know what
we'll be paying in rent.

16
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,250
So will everyone else.

17
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,250
I hope it's
a safe neighborhood.

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,760
You're kidding, right?

19
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,760
You can never be
too careful.

20
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,280
Yes?

21
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,780
Hi, I'm Rick Holland.
This is Kathryn Bennett.

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,780
I spoke to you last week
about the apartment.

23
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,290
Now wait a minute.

24
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,290
You called last week?

25
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,290
Yes, I told you
we'd be arriving
today or yesterday,

26
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,800
and you said a unit
would be available.

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
You came here
yesterday or today?

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
Well, which was it?

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,810
No. We called you
last week from New York
about an apartment.

30
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,810
Oh, New York!
You're the couple
from New York City!

31
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,310
That wasn't yesterday
that I talked to you.

32
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,820
That was last week.

33
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
- How was the drive up?
- Oh, great.

34
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
I suppose you want
to see the unit.

35
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh, I thought the unit
was on the second floor.

36
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,360
It is.

37
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Too many keys.
I tried to have
just the one master,

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,870
but these people
keep changing
the lock on me.

39
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
What do you think?

40
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Well, it's fine.

41
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,380
I just-- I thought
we were going to be
on the second floor.

42
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,390
Well, this is the model unit.

43
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,390
It's been empty
for quite a while, so I
just use it to show people.

44
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,400
All the units are the same.

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
The one you two
would be getting is
on the second floor.

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
But I'm getting old,

47
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,910
and you can't expect me
to go traipsing up and down
the stairs all day long,

48
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,910
showing apartments if
people aren't going
to take it.

49
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,910
That's fine,
if they're all the same.

50
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,910
It's a great deal, you know.

51
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,920
During the summer,
I can get $120 a night

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
for a unit like this.

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,930
But it's a been a little slow
the past few years,

54
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,930
so we're all filled up
with long-termers.

55
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,440
Now there's no guarantee
that you can stay past
the off season.

56
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,440
We were pretty busy
last summer,

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
but we'll just have to see what
the tourist traffic is like.

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Now, there's
no pets allowed...

59
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,950
and no drugs.

60
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,950
And you'll have
to sign a paper

61
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,950
saying that you're not gonna
fool with the smoke detector.

62
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,470
Hey.

63
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,980
Well, we've actually
found someone who's
immune to your charms.

64
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
I guess.

65
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,490
- Oh, God.
- It smells in here.

66
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,990
Probably just needs
airing out.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
Finally, a bathroom.

68
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- What is it? Honey?

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,510
- It's disgusting!
- What is it?

70
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,010
Turn on the light!
Don't come in!

71
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,010
- Oh! I'm gonna puke.
- Just get out of there.

72
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,010
Wash yourself off
in the kitchen, I guess.

73
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,520
- I can't believe this!
- I'm going to puke.

74
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
- Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey!
- Yeah?

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
We just moved into unit 16,
and the whole bathroom is
covered in excrement!

76
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
- What?
- Excrement!
The lights were off

77
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,030
and my girlfriend
went in there and
got it all over herself!

78
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,530
- What are you talking about?
- Excrement!

79
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,030
Feces! Poo-poo! Shit!

80
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,530
It's everywhere in there!

81
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,040
And you want me
to clean it up?

82
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,560
Well, Mrs. Farthing
was beside herself,
apologizing.

83
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Are you gonna be
all right about living
on the first floor though?

84
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,070
I just don't think
I could ever feel clean
in that bathroom after that.

85
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,070
Me either. I can probably
rig something up
for these windows.

86
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,070
If it makes you feel better,
but, honestly, I think
this town looks safer

87
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,580
than where my dad lives
in Westchester.

88
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,580
But there's a lot
of drifters and bikers
that go to towns like this.

89
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,080
Stop worrying.
We'll be fine.

90
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,090
Hey, you know,
the previous tenant in here
was a writer too.

91
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,590
Really? What kind?

92
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,590
Well, she didn't say,
but she did refer to him
as "Mr. Warren."

93
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,590
Oh. You think it was
Peter Warren?

94
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,100
Yeah, I think so.
He's from up here, you know.

95
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Maybe that'll give you
inspiration.

96
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
To write a crappy best seller?
Let's hope not.

97
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,610
- Still, it's pretty cool.
- [voice on radio]

98
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,110
What is that noise?

99
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,610
Mrs. Farthing said
the woman next door
has a police scanner,

100
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,120
so we may need to move
the head of the bed to
the other side of the room.

101
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Um, in the meantime,
why don't you, uh,

102
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,120
take those dirty hands off me
and get in the shower

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,630
while I unload the car.

104
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,630
Sounds like a plan.

105
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,650
Warren!

106
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,650
Hi.

107
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,660
Are you all right?

108
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,160
Oh. Yes.

109
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,660
Yes, of course.
New neighbor.

110
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,670
We're moving in
next door.

112
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,170
I'm Rick.

113
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,170
Of course you are.

114
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,680
Oh, hey, moving in?
Want a plant?

115
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Excuse me?

116
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
A houseplant.
A fern maybe?

117
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Never mind.

118
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,690
Oh, hey, I guess
I should get to know
my new neighbor.

119
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,190
The name's Ted.

120
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,190
Hi, I'm Rick.
Rick Holland.

121
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,700
Of course you are.

122
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,200
[police scanner]

123
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,210
[voice]
Kathryn?

124
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,210
Kathryn. Beautiful name.

125
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,720
So what brings Rick and Kathryn
from New York City

126
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
up to our
horse's neck of the woods?

127
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,220
Well,
I work in the theater,

128
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,220
and New York is
pretty expensive.

129
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,730
We moved up here
so I could finally
get some writing done

130
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,230
and maybe open
one of my plays
in Portland.

131
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,230
You know, kind of
an out-of-town tryout

132
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,230
before bringing it
back to New York.

133
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,740
The theater? I hear
these satellite TV people

134
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,240
are putting you folks
out of business.

135
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,740
I think
we'll be okay.

136
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Ah, you do.

137
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,750
[police scanner]

138
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Rick?

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,260
[police scanner]

140
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
[thump]

141
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,770
[scanner off]

142
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,780
I thought that we'd be
getting a lot of snow
up here this time of year.

143
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,780
Not snow.

144
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
Rain.

145
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,780
You see? Wet.

146
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,790
Yeah, I saw that.
I guess I thought,
you know,

147
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,790
this time of year
we'd be buried in snow.

148
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,790
Snow, sleet, rain.
We get all sorts of
miserable weather here.

149
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,290
The worst of the snow
generally piles up inland.

150
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,800
Here on the coast,
it's usually rain this year.

151
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Gonna be a wet winter.
Forty days and forty nights.

152
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,310
Well, I guess I'll--
I'll be seeing you around.

153
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,810
Oh. Goodbye.

154
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,810
Goodbye.

155
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,310
I... I want your teeth.

156
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,310
This place isn't a motel.
It's an insane asylum.

157
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,320
- You mean that man?
- [groans]

158
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,820
One minute he doesn't
want to talk to me,

159
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,320
the next minute
he won't shut up.

160
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,820
And then he said
he wanted my teeth.

161
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,830
And you were trying
to drag me into it?

162
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,830
- What do you mean?
- I heard you calling me,

163
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,830
but I wasn't
coming to your rescue
wrapped in a towel.

164
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,330
I didn't call you.

165
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,340
I heard you.
These walls are paper thin.

166
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,840
I might have said your name
a couple of times.

167
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,350
It might have been
that lady's scanner too.
I can't believe how loud it is.

168
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,350
Yeah. We'll move the bed.

169
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,350
I just hope old Ted
doesn't snore.

170
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
I'm definitely
doing something tomorrow
to secure these windows.

171
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
I was out
in the parking lot
taking the stuff in,

172
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,870
there was
a guy out there
staring at me,

173
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,870
like he was
casing the joint
or something.

174
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,870
He was probably
just checking the rates
on that sign out there.

175
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,880
But you should
definitely fix the window
if it makes you feel better.

176
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Ah, you're probably right.

177
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,380
Sorry I'm such a coward.

178
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,390
What?

179
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,390
Nothing.
Can you grab the top sheet?

180
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,890
Yeah.

181
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,400
This mattress is
just a little uneven.

182
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
You're not a coward.

183
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,410
City living
does that to people.

184
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,910
If I'd been broken into
as many times as you have,
I'd have security issues too.

185
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,410
Come on.
Let's go to bed.

186
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm gonna start looking
for a job tomorrow.

187
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Tomorrow?

188
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,920
I thought that we were
going to take a couple
of days to, you know,

189
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,430
settle in and...
explore, get comfortable.

190
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,930
After I get a job.

191
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,930
We've got to have at least
one source of income
until you make us rich.

192
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,940
As a playwright?

193
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,940
You're going to be
selling fried dough for
a very, very long time.

194
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,940
I'm just waiting for you
to sell out and get some
of that Hollywood money.

195
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,950
Don't hold your breath.

196

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,400
What the--

199
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,910
What's he doing
in there?

200
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,410
[singing continues]

201
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,410
Do you think he's okay?

202
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,420
He's singing.

203
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
What?

204
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,920
Yeah.

205
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,420
Oh, my God.
It's awful.

207
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,930
- You think he heard us?
- No, I don't think so.

208
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,930
What time is it?

209
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,930
It's 2 a.m.
Must be his bedtime.

211
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,950
I thought old people
were supposed to be quiet

212
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,960
and go to bed early.

213
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,460
Should we
bang on the wall?

214
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,460
We don't want to seem like
jerks our first night here.

[rattling continues]

218
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,980
Oh, my God!
What is that, an earthquake?

219
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,480
In Maine?

220
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,980
It's just a crazy old man.

221
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
It's freezing in here.

222
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,990

Ted! It's Rick
from next door!

225
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,010
What the hell's
going on in there?

226
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,510
I'm trying to sleep!

227
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,510
Well, how is anybody else
supposed to sleep
with all this noise?

228
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,520
It's just a freight train.

229
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,020
In a few weeks,
you'll be sleeping
right through it.

230
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,520
Now go back to bed.

231
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,030
Sorry.

232
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,540
Sorry!

233
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,040
Sorry.

234
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,050
Sorry.

235
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,050
Damn kids.

236
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,060
So much for not
looking like jerks.

237
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,070
I just want
to go to bed.

238
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,570
It's freezing
in here.

239
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,570
Something's wrong
with that answering machine.

240
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,080
I hope it wasn't my dad calling.

241
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
It's bad enough he's all alone.

242
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I don't want him
worrying about me.

243
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,090
It's probably
just a wrong number.

244
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,590
Mrs. Farthing said that
our line's not even supposed
to be active until tomorrow.

What? What is it, honey?

250
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,450
Having a nightmare?

251
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,950
Yeah.

252
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,960
It was my mom.
She was here.

253
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
She was yelling at me.

254
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,960
[yawns]

255
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,970
It was just a dream.
Your mother loved you
so much.

256
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,970
I know. It's just
it was just so real.

257
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,970
Oh, my God.
You're burning up.

258
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,480
Oh, it's just
the long underwear.

259
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,490
It was just a dream,
Kathryn. You gotta...

260
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,000
stop feeling guilty
about that stuff
all the time.

261
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
I know.

262
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,010
You know,

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,510
if I had been there
when she died,
I wouldn't feel this way.

264
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,520
Well, why don't you
call your dad
in the morning?

265
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,020
That always
makes you feel better.

Hi, honey.

275
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,620
Hey. How are things
in the working world?

276
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,630
Thrilling.
Very quiet, lots of books.

You sound out of breath.

the crap out of me.

Oh, sorry.
How's the writing going?

Good, good.

I've got some ideas here
that I'm working on, you know.

Oh, great.

Well, I just wanted
to give you a call
and say I miss you.

Aww. Hey, do you know
what you'd like for dinner?

285
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,650
We can make something
together when I come home.

286
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,650
You just keep working,
okay?

287
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,150
I love you.

No, she's not.
Can I take a message?

292
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,190
I have to talk to Kathryn.

293
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,690
She's not here.
May I ask who's calling?

294
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,690
Rick? Is that you?

295
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,200
Who is this?

296
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
It's Barbara,
Kathryn's mother.

What do you want?

Rick, is that you?
It's Kathryn's mom.

This is not funny!
This call can be easily traced!

What is your problem?

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
Bla bla bla bla.

348
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,880
She says something like,
"I just worry about you

349
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,380
wandering out there alone
at night by yourself
with a killer on--"

350
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,890
[click]

351
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,400
[click]

352
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Gary: "No. The cops came by
and started harassing me."

353
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,400
Carol says: "No wonder,
with all the bodies

354
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
"that have been turning up
in the dumpsters around here.

355
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,910
I mean, look at you."

356
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,410
Gary gets kind of
sarcastic here.

357
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,410
"Trash-picking's a dirty job.
You want me to wear a tuxedo?"

358
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,910
Carol is, what, she's just
trying to show her concern.

359
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,920
Bla bla bla bla.

360
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,420
She says something like,
"I just worry about you

361
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,420
"wandering out there alone
at night by yourself with
a killer on the loose,

362
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,430
and I'm not crazy
about being left alone."

363
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,930
[tape continues]

364
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,430
[woman on tape]
Keep your mouth shut!

365
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Ohh!

366
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,440
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- It's okay. Are you okay?

367
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,450
- Uh...
- You're all hot again.

368
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,450
I feel like I'm freezing.

369
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,960
Can we just--
Can we just go to bed?

370
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,460
Yeah, sure.

371
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,930
[ringing]

372
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,770
[line ringing]

373
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,270
- [Rick] Hello?
- Kathryn, could you--

374
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,270
Oh, no. It's okay.
I was just calling home.

375
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,780
Everything all right?

376
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Yeah. I just forgot
to tell my boyfriend
something. Did need me?

377
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
I was wondering if,
before you go to lunch,

378
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,280
you could give us a hand
with the bar coding
over at audio-visual.

379
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,290
Oh, no problem.
I've still got
over an hour.

380
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,290
Great. I wish we had
ten more like you.

381
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,300
Hey.

382
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,800
You seen Stacy?

383
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,300
Who?

384
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Come on. Don't act like
you haven't noticed

385
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,310
the only other piece of ass
on this property
besides your wife.

386
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,810
The cleaning girl?

387
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,810
Uh, no,
I haven't seen her.

388
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,320
I saw you drinking
down at the...

389
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,330
Tidal Basin earlier, right?

390
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,830
Yep.

391
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,330
Thought so.

392
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,840
What are you doing there?

393
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,840
I'm trying to write.

394
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Yeah? What are you writing?

395
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,350
A play.

396
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,850
Really?

397
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,850
I'm a writer.

398
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,350
Really?

399
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,360
Yeah. Well,
writer-actor, really.

400
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,360
That's how me and Stacy met.
We were doing, uh...

401
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,370
Glass Menagerie
over at the Portland
City Theater last year.

402
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,370
Really?
You know, I was going
to go down there and--

403
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,870
Everything
all right here, Rick?

404
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,370
Yes, Ted.
Everything's fine.

405
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,880
Let's hope so.

406
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Uh, I gotta go.
I'll see you later.

407
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
- Maybe I'll buy you a beer.
- Yeah, sure.

408
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,380
Okay, man.

409
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,890
I'd watch that fella
if I were you.

410
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,890
Thanks, Ted.
I will.

411
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,400
- Well, here's Princess Kathryn.
- Hi, Ted.

412
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
- Howdy, milady.
- How are you?

413
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Can't complain.
Doesn't do any good anyway.

414
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,400
See you later.

415
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,410
Well...

416
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,410
Aren't you worried about
someone coming in
and robbing us blind?

417
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,410
I thought the place
needed airing out.

418
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,910
I can't argue with that.

419
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,910
I'm just wondering
what's happened to
my paranoid boyfriend.

420
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,920
There's nothing out there
to be afraid of.

421
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
[kiss]

422
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,420
Have you been drinking?

423
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,920
I stopped into a bar
to get out of the rain,

424
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,930
and I may have had
a beer, yes.

425
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,430
It smells like more than one.
And in the middle of the day?

426
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,930
That's not like you
at all, Mr. Holland.

427
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,930
I thought I was the drinker
in this relationship.

428
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,940
The way my writing's been going,
I'll take inspiration in
whatever form it may come.

429
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,440
You know, if things
aren't going well,
maybe I can help you.

430
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,950
- You can't help me write!
- Okay, okay.

431
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,950
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired or something.

432
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,450
- Or something.
- What?

433
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,960
Nothing. Forget it.

434
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,460
Why don't you just go lie down,
and I'll make us some dinner.

435
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
- No, that's not fair to you.
- Sure it is.

436
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
You've made dinner
every single night
since we've been here.

437
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
No. I haven't done
the dishes.

438
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,970
That's fine. It'll just
take me a few minutes.

439
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,970
Is it okay
if we close the door now?

440
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,470
- Yes.
- Thank you.

441
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,980
I'm all caught up.
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

442
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,490
Caught up?
It's not even noon yet.

443
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,490
You're amazing.

444
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,990
I suppose you could
give me a hand with
the new acquisitions.

445
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,490
Sure.

446
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,000
You know,
it's really a great way

447
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
to get first dibs
on the new materials.

448
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,520
There's an awful lot of this
paranormal stuff in here.

449
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Oh, I know:
ESPs, UFOs,

450
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,520
talking
to the dead.

451
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,030
I think it's good,
though.

452
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,030
It gives people a little
something to think about
in their lives.

453
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,030
A little mystery.

454
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,540
Oh, you think
you have a poltergeist?

455
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,540
No. Just crazy neighbors
and my boyfriend.

456
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
Oh, how's he doing?

457
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
I think he has a fever.

458
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,550
But it's not just that
I'm worried about.

459
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,550
What wrong?

460
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,050
I think spending so much
time alone is starting
to drive him a little nuts.

461
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,550
He goes out,
but he just ends up in bars.

462
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:03,060
And it's certainly
not helping him
get his writing done.

463
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,060
Well, uh,
maybe he's homesick.

464
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,560
Maybe.

465
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,570
Oh! Phantom stains.

466
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,070
Nothing a little
old-fashioned
elbow grease

467
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,570
and a stain remover
won't cure.

468
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,570
You know,
it's just mold.

469
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,080
My friend Maria
lives down the street.

470
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,080
She had
the Clorox bleach out.
She had everything--

471
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
- Looks like
an early day, ladies.
- What is it?

472
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,590
Bomb scare.
Time to go home.

473
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,090
Damn. Those kids these days.
This is their idea of a joke.

474
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:40,090
Well, at least you can
go and take care of that
homesick boyfriend of yours.

475
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,130
I guess you're feeling better.

476
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,640
Jesus.

477
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,150
God.

478
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,170
[arguing]

479
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
Coming!

480
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,690
Oh, hello!

481
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,190
- Is it rent time again?
- No.

482
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,200
- You're supposed to be at work.
- There was a bomb scare.

483
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, yes,
at the library.

484
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Mrs. Lameire
told me about it.

485
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
- She heard it on her scanner.
- Uh-huh.

486
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,710
There's a problem
in our room.

487
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,210
It's the mattress.
It's got something
all over it.

488
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,210
It looks like blood.

489
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,710
Could you come--

490
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,740
[arguing]

491
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,240
You there!

492
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,240
I thought I told you
to stay off this property!

493
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Mind your own business,
you old bat!

494
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,250
Stacy, leave that trash
in the gutter where he belongs

495
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,750
and get back to work.

496
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,750
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,260
If I see you anywhere near
that girl or on this property,

498
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm going to call
the police!

499
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,270
Stacy!

500
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,770
Mrs. Lameire's toilet
is still backed up,
the poor woman.

501
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,780
I'm sorry!
I'm going!

502
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:47,280
Now, did I hear you say
something about blood?

503
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Well, yeah.
It's a stain.

504
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,790
It was there before,
and now it just keeps
getting bigger,

505
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,290
and it's ruining
our sheets.

506
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,290
Oh, that's just mold.

507
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,290
No, the mold is
a whole other problem
altogether.

508
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,800
That's just mold.

509
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Shouldn't let it
get this bad.

510
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,810
Truthfully, the whole place
can do with a scrubbing.

511
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,810
I'll send Stacy in,
if it's too much for you.

512
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,320
No. No, thank you.
It wasn't mold. I told you.

513
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,820
It was a dark reddish brown,
like blood.

514
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,820
I don't see anything
like that in here.

515
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,830
It must be in the bed.

516
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,830
Sometimes I come home
and it's almost all dried up
and faded away,

517
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,330
and then that night it's back
and it's seeping through
the sheets.

518
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,830
Well, it's been
so damp lately.

519
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,340
It was right here.

520
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,340
Oh, my.

521
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,340
That's nothing.
You should have seen it
five minutes ago.

522
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,850
Oh, dear.

523
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,360
- What?
- Now I remember.

524
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,870
This mattress...
was in room 16

525
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,370
when Mr. DeLuca
was living there.

526
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,380
He was the victim
of a home invasion.

527
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,880
It was terrible.

528
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,380
They never caught the buggers.

529
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,890
Bikers, I bet,
or maybe even Canadians.

530
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,890
I don't know what
this world is coming to.

531
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,890
Well, what is it
doing in here?

532
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,900
We cleaned everything up
after--

533
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,400
well, you know--

534
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,400
and then we switched
the mattresses from
the one upstairs.

535
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,910
The stain was so small

536
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,410
compared to the blood
that was everywhere.

537
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,920
And then this room
was never used.

538
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,920
It hasn't been used
in ages, so...

539
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,930
I just forgot all about it.

540
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,930
That happens
when you get older.

541
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,930
Sometimes your mind
just doesn't think straight.

542
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,940
I am so terribly sorry.

543
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll call
the Bedding Warehouse
right away

544
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,950
and have them haul
this evil thing away

545
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,950
and bring you
a brand-new one.

546
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,450
Thank you.

547
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,460
Don't thank me.

548
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,460
I can't believe I made
such a terrible mistake.

549
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,960
And you've been
sleeping on this
all this time?

550
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,470
You should have
come and told me.

551
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,470
How quickly do you think
the new mattress
could be here?

552
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,470
I really don't want
Rick to see this.

553
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,470
He gets pretty upset about
things like home invasions.

554
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,480
Oh, they come pretty fast.

555
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm sure they'll be
in and out of here

556
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,480
before your boyfriend
gets back from work.

557
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Well, that's the problem.
He works from home,

558
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,490
so I have
no way of knowing
when he'll be here.

559
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,990
Oh?

560
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,490
I thought he went out
and got himself a real job.

561
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,000
Playwriting!

562
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Still, he keeps
pretty regular hours,

563
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,500
9:30, 10:00,

564
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,500
then he comes home
just before you do.

565
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,010
Really?

566
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:39,010
I am not sticking my nose
in where it doesn't belong.

567
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,520
Really, dear.

568
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,520
I just like to keep
an eye on things.

569
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Of course.

570
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,030
Well, I'll go call
the mattress folks.

571
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
[sighs]

572
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,480
You're home early.

573
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,980
What are you doing home?

574
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,990
Somebody called in
a bomb scare
at the library.

575
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,990
What's all this?

576
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:43,990
Mrs. Farthing said that they
have to change the mattresses
every certain number of years.

577
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,500
It's some state regulation
or something.

578
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,000
I see you cleaned.

579
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Just a little.

580
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,010
The place just needed
a little cleaning up.

581
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,510
I was gonna do it.

582
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,510
Hey, what's all this
"You're home early" stuff?

583
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,020
Mrs. Farthing was telling me
about your daily routine.

584
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,020
Nosy old farts just can't
mind their own business!

585
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,020
Where do you go
all day?

586
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,530
I take walks.
You know that.

587
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,530
Sometimes
I stop into this bar.

588
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,030
Oh, that I can tell.
You smell like a brewery.

589
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,540
You want me to stay cooped up
in this little place all day?

590
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,040
I need go out someplace
where I can sit,

591
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,550
think, write.

592
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,550
There are such things
as libraries.

593
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,050
I'm not going to the place
where you work to write.

594
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,050
I didn't mean my library.
There are two other branches.

595
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,560
But, of course,
they don't serve beer.

596
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,560
Why are you doing this?

597
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,060
Is it because I didn't do
some of my household chores?

598
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,070
I'm sorry.
Let's just forget it.

599
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:06,080
I'm trying to
adjust to, you know,
things in this apartment.

600
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,580
And I...

601
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
I don't know.

602
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,590
I'm not comfortable
here and...

603
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,590
I need to go out and
get comfortable to write.

604
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,090
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

605
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,090
Just don't drink
all of my earnings away.

606
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,600
Fine! I'll get a job!

607
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,100
I was joking, okay?
I don't want you
to get a job.

608
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,600
That would defeat
our whole purpose of--

609
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,610
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on?

610
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,610
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

611
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,610
I'm just not
feeling well.

612
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,120
Hey, no, no.
Just lay down.

613
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,120
It's all right.

614
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,620
You're not seeing
someone else,
are you?

615
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,130
[chuckles]
Not the way you're thinking.

616
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,130
What does that mean?

617
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,130
Uh, no, it's, uh--

618
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,140
Nah. It's--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

619
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,640
No. I have been hanging out
at this bar, yes,

620
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,140
with a guy and writer--

621
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,650
that writer-director guy.

622
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,650
He's a writer-director.
We have a lot in common.

623
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,650
[mumbles]

624
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,660
At least
you're making friends.

625
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,660
Yeah.

626
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,000
You don't have
to stay here
with me all day.

627
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,510
Oh, no. I'm just going to try
to get some writing done
in the laundry room.

628
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,010
You rest.

629
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,030
Cleanliness
is next to godliness.

630
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,050
[loud rattling]

631
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
What's wrong?

632
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,580
I just remembered
I need to go out.
Do you need anything?

633
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,090
- Where are you going to go?
- I need to meet Phil.

634
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,590
- Who's Phil?
- That writer-actor guy
I told you about.

635
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,090
He was going to have a meeting
with a big producer and--

636
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,090
- Oh, yeah?
- He might be able
to help me out.

637
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,100
Okay. Well, can you
call him or something?

638
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,100
I don't have his number.
Look, I won't be long.

639
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
The laundry is almost done.

640
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,600
I'll take it out
when I get back.

641
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,100
Okay, okay.

642
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,610
Can I take the car?

643
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,610
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

644
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,610
Rick, can you take the--

645
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,630
[ringing]

646
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,630
- Hello.
- [static]

647
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,630
- Hello? I can't hear you.
- [woman] This is the end--

648
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,140
[garbled]
Leave here now--

649
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,140
- Hello?
- Hello?

650
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,140
- Oh, Claudette.
- Can you hear me all right?

651
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,650
I can now. There was
a lot of static on the line.

652
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,150
How are you feeling?

653
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,650
Awful.

654
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,650
I just-- I can't
shake this thing.

655
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,650
It's been three days,
and I don't feel any better.

656
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,650
If anything, I feel worse.

657
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,660
Have you gone to a doctor?

658
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,160
No, not yet, but if
I don't get better soon,
I'm going to have to.

659
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,160
You really should
see someone.

660
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,160
I know,
but I can't afford it.

661
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,670
I'm supporting us both
right now.

662
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,170
You don't have insurance?

663
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,170
No. My policy
from the last job ran out,

664
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,680
and I haven't been
at the library long enough
to get a new one.

665
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,180
[sighs]
You know, I didn't want
to bring this up,

666
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,680
- but...
- What?

667
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,680
The director's
being a bitch.

668
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,690
She says that since you're
a new hire and you've been
out for a couple days now,

669
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,190
that you have to come back
to work with a doctor's note

670
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,690
or else they're going
to have to let you go.

671
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,200
I'm sorry.

672
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
That's okay.
I understand.

673
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,200
I tried to explain to her
how great you are.

674
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,700
That's all right.

675
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,710
I'll try to get a good night's
sleep tonight and see if I can
get in there tomorrow.

676
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,210
You sound terrible.

677
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,210
Why don't I try
to find you a doctor?

678
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,210
No, that's okay.

679
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,720
You know, I'm not being
totally selfless.

680
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,220
If we lose you,
I'll have to do all
of the work again myself.

681
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,720
Well, who do you see?

682
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,230
My doctor can only take
people through HMOs.

683
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,730
I'll see if I can find
some sort of clinic
or something, okay?

684
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,230
That would be great.
Thanks, Claudette.

685
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,230
It's my pleasure.

686
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,740
I'll let you
get some rest now.
Take care.

687
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,240
- Bye.
- Okay, thanks. Bye.

688
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,780
That's it?

689
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,280
One page?

690
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,790
[sighs]

691
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:26,820
Sorry I was out so late.
Phil and I had a lot
to talk about.

692
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,330
You didn't have to do that.
I said I would bring that
laundry in when I came back.

693
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,830
I didn't want Ted rummaging
through my underwear.

694
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,840
How did your friend's meeting
with the producer go?

695
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,840
Pretty well.
He said pretty well.

696
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,340
Is there anything in it
for you?

697
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,350
Maybe. I've got to get some
writing samples together.

698
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,850
You have anything?

699
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:01,850
Yeah. What do you think
I've been working on
this whole time?

700
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,850
One page.

701
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,860
There's more to it
than that.

702
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,360
What have you been doing,
going through my stuff
without telling me?

703
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,360
I didn't read anything.
I just looked at it.

704
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,360
I know I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry.

705
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,360
I can't take this.

706
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,870
I can't work like this.
I get no support from you!

707
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:23,870
No support?
I've done nothing but
support you since we got here!

708
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,880
That's not what I mean.
I'm sorry.

709
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,380
It's just
in this little room and--

710
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,880
I can't concentrate.

711
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,390
And I feel like I'm
going insane in here.

712
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,890
Why don't you talk to me
about this stuff?

713
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,390
You used to tell me everything.
Now you just clam up.

714
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,900
I just need
to be able think.

715
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,910
I can't think
in this apartment,

716
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,910
and I can't think with you
hassling me all the time.

717
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,910
I didn't realize
I was hassling you.

718
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
You don't understand.

719
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,920
I mean, you're not
a creative person.

720
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,920
Writing is not like
sitting at a desk,

721
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,430
typing in names
into a card catalog.

722
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,430
I need to...

723
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,930
I need to concentrate.

724
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,440
Maybe if you had some dreams
of your own, you'd understand.

725
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,940
Dreams of my own?

726
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,940
I have dreams of my own.

727
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,440
I just put them all on hold,
so I could help you
realize yours!

728
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:39,950
And I took all the same
creative classes
as you did in college.

729
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,950
The only difference is
that I actually graduated!

730
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,460
You took the safe route,
while I actually
went out and did stuff.

731
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,960
And look where it got you.

732
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,960
You're an assistant
at a library in the
middle of nowhere.

733
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,960
That job and all
the others before it

734
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,960
are what's made
this trip possible.

735
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,970
That's what paid
for the car,

736
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,970
and that's what paid for
the computer that you're
supposed to be writing on,

737
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,470
not to mention all the beer
you've been drinking.

738
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,980
Don't worry.
I won't forget that!
How could I ever forget that?

739
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,980
What is it?

740
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,990
I just don't feel so good.

741
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,990
I'm sorry, Rick.
I just--

742
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't know why
we're fighting so much.

743
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,510
You're really drunk,
and I feel like death.

744
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,510
Could we please just try
to work this out tomorrow?

745
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,020
No.

746
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,020
I'm leaving.

747
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,520
Come on. Please?

748
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,030
Just come to bed.

749
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,030
I can't stay here anymore.

750
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,530
It's driving me nuts.

751
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,530
Well, maybe I can just
work a few extra hours,

752
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,540
and we can get a place
that's bigger.

753
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,040
I'm tired of living
in the middle of nowhere!

754
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,040
There's nothing here!

755
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,050
I've been trying
to tell you for days now,

756
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,050
but you've been so sick.

757
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:22,050
Tell me what?
Tell me! What?

758
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,060
Phil made a deal
with that producer.

759
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:33,560
He's going out to L.A.,
and he's going to be
developing a TV show.

760
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,070
I might be able
to get on board.

761
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,070
It's not 100%,
but once he gets in,

762
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,070
I'll probably be able
to get a job.

763
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,570
L.A.?

764
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,070
You hate L.A.!

765
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,080
And TV?

766
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,080
Whatever happened
to never selling out?

767
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
It's a chance to get
my foot in the door.

768
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,080
- I'm not getting any younger.
- God! So that's it?

769
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,590
So that's it. This was
just a whole waste of time.

770
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,090
We're moving to L.A.?

771
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,590
No. Just me.

772
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,600
I need time alone
to write and...

773
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,600
Well, Phil's going to need
a roommate out there.

774
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,100
And what am I
supposed to do?

775
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,110
Stay here.

776
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,110
You seem to be doing all right.

777
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,610
There's always New York.
You can go back there.

778
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:27,120
So it's over?

779
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,120
You don't love me anymore?

780
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,630
It's just not good times
for us right now.

781
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,130
I mean, uh...

782
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,640
My career
and my life,

783
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,640
I mean, it's too
up in the air for...

784
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,650
us to have got so tied down
like we got here.

785
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,650
I've got to think
of my future.

786
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,150
I've got to think
of my writing.

787
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,150
I need to be able to write,

788
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,160
go and write
and experience living.

789
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Oh, yeah, by living in
Hollywood and getting drunk
all the time with Phil?

790
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,160
[sobbing]

791
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,670
It beats slaving away
at some nine-to-five job,

792
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,170
worrying about
credit card payments.

793
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,680
Okay.

794
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Okay, fine.

795
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,680
So when do you go?

796
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,690
Tonight.

797
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,190
What?

798
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,190
I said I've been trying
to tell you for days!

799
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,700
I just came to pick up
a few things,

800
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,210
and then I've got
to go meet Phil.

801
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:02,710
He and Stacy got into a fight,
and she kicked him out.

802
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,210
Wait a minute.

803
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,220
The housekeeper's boyfriend?
That's your friend Phil?

804
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,220
Yeah. He's a nice guy.

805
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,220
You can't be serious.

806
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,730
You're 34 years old.
What's happened to you?

807
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,230
Nothing.

808
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,730
I just gotta
get out of here.

809
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,740
So you're just
abandoning me here?

810
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,740
The rent is due
in two days. I either
have to move out tomorrow

811
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,740
or pay it for another month
and stay here by myself.

812
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,750
Take my advice: Move out.

813
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,250
Where am I supposed to go?

814
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,750
This is so sudden,
and I'm really sick.

815
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:47,760
You have credit cards.
You've got a job.
You'll be fine.

816
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,260
[sobbing]
Why are you
doing this to me?

817
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,770
- I don't know.
- No.

818
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,770
- Goodbye, Kathryn.
- No, no.

819
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,770
No, Rick, no. Please.

820
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,780
Please, Rick, please.

821
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,280
I'll... call you.

822
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,290
Thanks for getting
the laundry.

823
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,790
No, Rick. Rick, Rick!

824
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,290
Rick, please!

825
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:27,300
No, no, no, no!

[Claudette]
Kathryn,
it's the library again.

832
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,040
I've been calling you
for a few days now,

833
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,040
and I'm getting
really worried.

834
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,540
Please pick up, Kathryn.

835
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,040
I don't know if I should
come over there

836
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,050
or call the police or what.

837
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,550
Please give me a call
at the library or at home.

838
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,550
It doesn't matter what time.

839
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:00,060
Just let me know you're alive.

840
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,020
[hangs up]

841
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,560
- [knocking]
- [Claudette] Hello!

842
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,060
Kathryn?

843
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,570
- Hello?
- Who is it?

844
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,980
Kathryn, is that you?

845
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,490
[knocking]

846
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:19,490
Hello? It's me.
It's Claudette. Open up.

847
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,000
Oh, thank God!
You're alive!

848
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:25,000
I just-- Oh!

849
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What happened to you?

850
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,500
Um, I'm so sorry,
Claudette.

851
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,010
I... I just woke up.
I was going to give you a call.

852
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:35,510
I was gonna listen
to your messages.

853
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:39,010
Give me a call? I've been
trying to get in touch
with you for a week.

854
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:43,020
- What?
- I've been calling you
since last Thursday.

855
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,020
Wait. What day is today?

856
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,520
- It's Tuesday.
- Tuesday?

857
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,530
I lost a whole week.

858
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,530
Oh, God.

859
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,030
Oh, God.

860
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,540
You know, I can't believe
I've been so stupid.

861
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,040
You're so together at work, and
you've got those fancy clothes.

862
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,040
I didn't think
that there was a problem.

863
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,040
- That eye.
- What? What problem?

864
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,050
Come on. I'm not stupid.
I'm from Maine.

865
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,050
Our winters
are long and cold.

866
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:20,550
- I know about this.
- Wait. You think I'm a drunk?

867
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,060
- Well--
- [chuckles]

868
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,560
No, I mean, I'm just--

869
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,060
If you admit
that you have a problem,

870
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,060
then we can do something
about it and you'll get better.

871
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,560
I don't know. Maybe you can
even get your old job back.

872
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:36,070
Oh, she fired me?

873
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:41,070
Well, you know,
I... I warned you.

874
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,080
Look, Claudette,
I know what this
must look like,

875
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,080
but I'm not an alcoholic
or a junkie

876
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,580
or whatever this
looks like to you.

877
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,590
I-- I just, um...

878
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:57,590
I've just been
really sick and...

879
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,590
and Rick left me.

880
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,100
Oh, I...

881
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,100
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

882
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,600
Yeah, he just left.

883
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
It came out of nowhere.

884
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,100
But you know, maybe--

885
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:14,110
I mean, if he's
the kind of guy who's
going to do that to you,

886
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,610
you don't need him.

887
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:17,610
Rick didn't do this.
He would never.

888
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,110
- He's not like that.
- Well, then who did?

889
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:24,120
Well, I don't know.
I just woke up with it.

890
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,620
I mean, I must have
fallen out of bed or--

891
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,120
[sighs]
Okay, look.

892
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,120
I've got to go back to work.
I just, um...

893
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:36,130
You know, I have some numbers
of some doctors. Would you
just take them and--

894
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:40,630
No. Thank you very much,
but I told you
I really don't think--

895
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:46,140
It doesn't have to be now.
Just take them and call me
if you need anything.

896
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,640
- Okay.
- How are you set for money?

897
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,150
I have another check
coming from my last week
of work, don't I?

898
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:55,650
Right.
They'll mail it to you.

899
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,150
But is that enough?

900
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:02,150
Well, I have some money
in the bank, and I have--

901
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:06,160
Oh, the rent was due days ago.
[laughs]

902
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Well, I'll be fine, Claudette.
Thank you so much for coming by.

903
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,160
Oh, no. I was just--
You had me all worried.

904
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,170
Thanks.

905
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,670
No. Look, just please--

906
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,670
Oh, listen. Would you--

907
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,180
Would you take
these back for me?

908
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,680
I can't really afford
any overdue fines.

909
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,680
Yes. Please just call me
if you need anything.

910
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,180
- I will. Thanks.
- Okay.

911
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,190
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

912
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:03,720
[knocking]

913
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,220
Yes? Can I help you?

914
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,220
Hi, Mrs. Farthing.

915
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,730
It's Kathryn Bennett
from unit 13.

916
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,730
Unit 13 is rented.
You'll have to go
somewhere else.

917
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:24,740
No, it's me, Kathryn.
I already live in 13.

918
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,740
Oh, it is you.
I didn't even recognize you.

919
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,750
I'm sorry this is so late.
I've been sick.

920
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:36,250
I hadn't realized
it was that time already.

921
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,250
I was wondering
where you were.

922
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:41,250
I haven't seen
that man of yours
around lately either.

923
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,760
He moved out.

924
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,760
Oh, I see.

925
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,260
Why don't you come in
and rest for just a minute?

926
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,260
Oh, you look terrible.

927
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,770
- No, I'm all right.
- I insist.

928
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:54,270
Oh, my goodness! Oh!

929
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:57,270
- You all right, dear?
- I'm sorry.

930
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,270
Come in.

931
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,300
Oh.

932
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,810
Shh. Your head is getting pink.
You have to be careful.

933
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,310
Your skin is so fair.

934
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,810
You can get a sunburn
even though it's not summer.

935
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:40,310
Oh.

936
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,320
Oh, thank you.

937
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,820
I'm sorry the room
is such a mess.

938
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,820
Oh, it's not so bad.
It just needed
a little picking up.

939
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,330
It's hard keeping up
with all that mold.

940
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:58,830
You know, Mrs. Farthing said
she thinks that's what's
made me so sick.

941
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:00,830
Maybe.

942
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,840
What, you don't think so?

943
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,840
Whenever I'm in there,
I feel something.

944
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:13,350
It's like the room
is creepy, evil.

945
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:15,850
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

946
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,850
The place has always seemed
a little depressing to me.

947
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:23,360
It's like all the unhappiness
that you experienced in there
is still lingering.

948
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,360
It's like it's haunted
by bad feelings.

949
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,860
You think I'm crazy.

950
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,370
No, I don't.
I know what you mean.

951
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,870
Well, I can put some
herbs and stuff in there

952
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:38,370
that are supposed to cleanse
the spirit of the room.

953
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,870
- If nothing else,
it smells nice.
- Oh, that's okay.

954
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,380
Actually, I already did.

955
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,380
Thank you.

956
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,380
Why are you being
so nice to me?

957
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,380
I never thought
you liked us very much.

958
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,380
I'm sorry.

959
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,890
You know I was having
man troubles of my own.

960
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:55,890
Sorry.

961
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,890
Oh, it's okay.
It's over now.

962
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,890
He's gone.
I'm better off.

963
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:01,890
[Mrs. Farthing]
That's enough, Stacy.

964
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:06,900
We have to let this pretty
little lady get her rest.

965
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,900
- See you later.
- Thanks.

966
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,900
How are you feeling?

967
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,910
- A little better, thanks.
- Well, you look it.

968
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:18,910
I know how much
you like to read,
so I brought you the paper.

969
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:23,420
And these are some of the books
that the man who used to live
in your unit wrote.

970
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,920
He wrote a few of these
all while he was living here.

971
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,420
They're all about the lives
of various local celebrities
and politicians.

972
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,430
Eww!

973
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:35,930
I didn't mean
to bring out that one.

974
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,930
So it was Peter Warren.

975
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:40,930
That's his real name,
supposedly.

976
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:45,440
Lord knows why he decided
to use it for this trash.

977
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:50,940
Once he started making money
writing this nonsense,
he moved out of here.

978
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,450
He's a really famous writer.

979
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:56,950
I wouldn't know.
I don't read
that sort of trash.

980
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:00,450
And neither should you.
You're sick enough as it is.

981
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,460
Stick to his good ones.

982
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,460
They're all true stories,
you know.

983
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,460
Everyone should read.

984
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,460
Helps you
to keep an open mind.

985
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,480
- All done!
- Oh, thank you.

986
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,980
I'll have to
make it up to you sometime
when I'm feeling better.

987
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,490
Forget it.

988
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,490
- Did Mrs. Farthing
give you those?
- Yeah.

989
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:37,990
Pretty seedy, huh?

990
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,990
I didn't know Peter Warren
wrote this kind of stuff.

991
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:41,490
I don't think
he brags about it.

992
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,000
You can see why
he used a fake name.

993
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,500
I've never heard
of half these people.

994
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,500
You would if you were
from New England.

995
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,000
That guy was a very prominent
minister around here.

996
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Very important guy.

997
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,010
Then one day this book
comes out and tells
the world that he's gay

998
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,010
and that he paid some woman
to have a baby for him,

999
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,510
then the woman goes
and kills herself
and the baby.

1000
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:02,510
Did you know him?

1001
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,020
No. It was
way before our time.

1002
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,020
Most of it's supposedly
not true anyway.

1003
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,020
But don't tell
Mrs. Farthing that.

1004
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,520
She makes everyone
read these books.

1005
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,530
They're horrible.

1006
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:16,030
But actually I like
his horror stuff.

1007
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:19,530
I've never read any of it.
I used to think those books
looked kind of trashy.

1008
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:23,040
Oh. You know,
I can lend them to you.

1009
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,540
You should actually read them
because the first one was
written in your apartment.

1010
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,040
Oh, okay. Thanks.

1011
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,540
Sure.

1012
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,540
[Mrs. Farthing]
Stacy!

1013
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,050
See you later. Bye.

1014
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,210
Aha.

1015
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,230
Good afternoon, milady.
You're looking radiant today.

1016
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,730
Thank you, Ted.
How are you?

1017
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:25,230
Still plugging along.
Haven't seen you out
basking in the sun lately.

1018
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:28,730
Oh, I have a new job.
It keeps me indoors a lot.

1019
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,240
I'm doing research
on the Internet.

1020
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,240
The Internet?
Of course.

1021
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,240
Hey.

1022
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,740
You want a cactus?

1023
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,750
- What?
- It's a cactus.

1024
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,750
They grow in the desert.
They don't take much water.

1025
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:44,250
This one's been
in my back pocket
for I don't know how long.

1026
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,750
You want it?

1027
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,250
I don't think so.

1028
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,760
I'm with you.

1029
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,260
I can't seem to
stay away from plants.

1030
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,760
Somebody
drops in for a visit,
they give me plant.

1031
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,260
My nephew and his wife drive
all the way across country
from Amarillo.

1032
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,270
They smuggle me a plant.

1033
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,270
Comes my birthday,
all I ever get is plants.

1034
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,770
Really?

1035
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,270
I'm learning
to hate them.

1036
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:08,270
Trees, yes,
but houseplants,

1037
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,280
they shrivel up,
they get bugs and
spiders on them.

1038
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,780
Who'd want them things
in their house?

1039
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,280
And plus, our apartments
don't get very much sunlight.

1040
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,780
You know, you're right.

1041
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,290
Maybe that's why
mine are all dying.

1042
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,790
What's that you're reading,
Ms. Kathryn?

1043
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,790
Oh, uh, Peter Warren.

1044
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:25,790
Oh.

1045
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,790
That rattlesnake.

1046
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,800
Not a good neighbor?

1047
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,300
Good enough neighbor.
Just a bad man.

1048
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,300
Really? How so?

1049
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,300
I introduced him
to a friend of mine.

1050
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,810
- Didn't end so good.
- Did something happen?

1051
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:42,810
Well, it seemed like Warren
wanted to make it big

1052
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:46,310
by exposing folk''
dirty laundry.

1053
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:47,810
[sighs]

1054
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:50,320
My friend worked
for this minister.

1055
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,820
I suppose Mrs. Farthing
has forced that book
on you by now.

1056
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,820
She has.

1057
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,320
My friend Kurt looked after
the church grounds.

1058
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,330
It paid chicken feed.

1059
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,830
Time come when he needed
some cash real bad,

1060
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:07,330
so he let himself
sell Warren
one hell of a story.

1061
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:09,840
Anonymously,
of course.

1062
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,340
There were things
going on at that rectory.

1063
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,840
Nothing criminal.

1064
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,340
Just stuff ordinary folks
might not expect
of a minister.

1065
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,850
I read all about it,
but I didn't quite
understand it.

1066
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:24,350
The reverend was gay,
but he paid some woman
to have his baby?

1067
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,350
It didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me.

1068
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,850
Warren exaggerated some.

1069
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:31,360
Doesn't matter if
it was true or not.
It ruined the reverend.

1070
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,860
Kurt never
forgave himself.

1071
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:35,360
That's terrible.

1072
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,360
That book did in
a lot of people.

1073
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,370
Guilt can be
a real killer.

1074
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:41,870
Yeah.

1075
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:44,870
Say, Ms. Kathryn,
now that you're single,

1076
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:47,370
maybe the two of us
could get together
for dinner and a drink

1077
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:49,370
and some good talk.

1078
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:51,380
Uh...

1079
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,880
I think it's probably
a little too soon for me
to start dating again, Ted,

1080
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,880
but thank you.

1081
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
You're very sweet.

1082
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,390
Well, you can't blame
an old fool for trying.

1083
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,890
I'm going to check my mail,
then I'm off to the races.

1084
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,890
- Good night.
- Good night.

1085
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:22,410
[water running]

1086
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,960
[Kathryn screams]

1087
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,470
[screaming]

1088
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:27,970
Oh, my God!
What's wrong, Kathryn?

1089
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,980
Th-There's... m-m-man
in the show--

1090
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,980
- Is it your boyfriend?
- No! Old man! Old man!

1091
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,980
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

1092
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:39,490
[stammering]

1093
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,490
Hello? Hello?

1094
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:44,490
[gasping]

1095
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,490
There's nobody
in there.

1096
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:48,490
There's no one
in there. It's okay.

1097
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:50,500
No! In the shower!

1098
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,500
I didn't see anyone
in there. It's okay.

1099
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Just relax. Calm down.

1100
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Let's go to
Mrs. Farthing's place,
and we'll just relax.

1101
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,010
- No one's in there?
- Nobody's in there.

1102
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,010
Come on.
It's freezing.

1103
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:06,510
[whimpering]

1104
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,010
It's okay.

1105
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,520
You're still
not well.

1106
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,520
- It's okay.
- No, I'm all right.

1107
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:20,030
Oh, God.
[whimpering]

1108
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,030
I swear.
Nobody's in there.

1109
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,030
Let's lie down
on the bed.

1110
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:30,540
It's okay.

1111
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,050
[tapping]

1112
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,060
How you doing?

1113
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,060
- Fine. Yourself?
- Not too bad.

1114
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,060
I just hope the next time
you decide to go streaking,
you'll invite me.

1115
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,060
[laughs]

1116
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,570
How about a drink
with an old man?

1117
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,570
I promise to be
a perfect gentleman,

1118
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,570
and I won't
offer you a plant.

1119
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:08,070
Um...

1120
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:10,580
I'd love one.
A drink, not a plant.

1121
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,580
- My place or yours?
- Yours. Definitely yours.

1122
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,090
So, no union card,
no work.

1123
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:26,090
That's mainly why
I retired from the rodeo.

1124
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,590
Do you miss it?

1125
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,600
I miss the crowds,
the cheering.

1126
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,600
I miss the pretty ladies
who used to come up after,
looking to get acquainted.

1127
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:38,100
But the ground got too hard,
my head got bonked
one too many times.

1128
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:43,110
So I went roaming
God knows where.
I ended up here.

1129
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,110
What brought you to Maine?

1130
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,610
I come for the waters.

1131
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:51,620
Time does go by,
but look at me.

1132
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,620
I'm 76 years old,
I'm sitting here drinking
with a beautiful woman

1133
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,120
young enough to be
my granddaughter.

1134
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,620
Now, you promised
to be a gentleman.

1135
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,130
Don't mind me,
Miss Kathryn.

1136
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:04,130
I'm just a harmless
dirty old man.

1137
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:07,130
Though you're the first lady
to come in this place since--

1138
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:11,640
well, since the last time
Mrs. Farthing forced
spring-cleaning on me.

1139
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,140
I had some
good times though.

1140
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,140
Hold on a second.

1141
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,640
You know, after you
got me talking about
my old friend Kurt,

1142
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,650
I dug out these photos.

1143
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:24,650
Sentimental, you know.

1144
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:28,650
Oh, now, I know
I just saw one of him
in here somewhere.

1145
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:31,160
- Is Kurt still alive?
- No.

1146
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:35,160
He drank himself
to death.

1147
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,160
That thing
with the minister.

1148
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,160
That's terrible.

1149
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,170
After Reverend Martin
hanged himself,
Kurt lost it.

1150
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:48,170
I suppose I should feel
sort of responsible too,
but what's done is done.

1151
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:52,180
- It's not your fault.
- That's what I told Kurt.

1152
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:56,680
Kurt come here a day or two
before the book came out
and begged Warren to stop it.

1153
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,680
Warren said
it was too late.

1154
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,690
Kurt tried,
but what could he do?

1155
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:04,190
I told him to leave his guilt
in that room with Warren
and get on with his life.

1156
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,690
And did Warren ever
say anything to you about it?

1157
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:08,690
Same thing he always said:

1158
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,200
"The truth must come out."

1159
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,700
I always wondered why,
if he was so concerned
about the truth,

1160
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,700
he didn't use his own name
on those exposés.

1161
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,210
And whatever happened
to the woman--

1162
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:22,710
the woman who was paid
to have the reverend's baby?

1163
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,210
So she claimed.

1164
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:25,710
So it wasn't even true?

1165
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:30,720
Reverend Martin was
as gay as a wind chime.

1166
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,220
Baby was probably
some biker's.

1167
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:37,220
But that crazy lady was obsessed
with the reverend and wanted
to be part of his life,

1168
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,220
even if it was only
in Warren's book.

1169
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:43,230
She even threatened
to kill Kurt if he told
anybody it wasn't true.

1170
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,230
But why did she
kill the baby?

1171
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:47,730
Psychotic.

1172
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:51,740
She wouldn't
let up on Kurt,
Warren or Martin.

1173
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,240
If she hadn't killed herself,
she'd still be here
hounding somebody.

1174
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,240
Oh, wait a minute.
There it is.

1175
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,750
That's Kurt and me.

1176
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:05,750
We went to the races with
a few other old fogies.

1177
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:08,250
Even won a few bucks.

1178
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,260
That was the last time
I saw him smile.

1179
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,770
You know, Ms. Kathryn,
Mrs. Farthing never even
let out that room

1180
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:24,770
till you came along.

1181
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:28,770
I think you kind of
brighten the place up.

1182
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,780
I have to go.

1183
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,780
Already?

1184
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,280
- Oh, Ms. Kathryn, I'm sorry.
- No.

1185
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:38,280
- I promised to be a gentleman.
- You were. Thank you.

1186
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,790
Thank you.
Good night.

1187
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:43,290
Night.

1188
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:14,320

1189
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:18,820
- Hi. It's me.
- Rick.

1190
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,330
I hope you're doing okay.

1191
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:22,830
I just wanted to call
and see how you were doing.

1193
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,830
[woman]
Leave.

1194
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,910
[rings]

1195
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:47,910
[beeps]

1196
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:49,410
[woman]
Kathryn?

1197
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,920
Oh, my God.

1198
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,920
Kathryn?
It's me, Mom.

1199
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,920
- Mom!
- [high-pitched tone]

1200
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,420
[woman]
Keep your mouth shut!

1201
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:04,930
[rings]

1202
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:07,930
Kathryn, it's time to leave.

1203
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:12,440
You will stay here
and keep your mouth shut!

1204
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,940
[rings]

1205
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,440
Kathryn?

1206
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,450
Mom, I'm sorry.

1207
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:25,450
There is nothing for you
to feel sorry about, dear.

1208
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:27,950
This guilt isn't yours.

1209
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:30,460
It's time for you
to leave it behind.

1210
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,460
[rumbling]

1211
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,000
Kathryn!

1212
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Kathryn!

1213
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,500
Kathryn!

1214
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,510
Stupid damn keys.

1215
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,510
Never could get
these keys to work.

1216
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:30,520
Kathryn, open the door!

1217
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,520
Kathryn, go!

1218
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,020
I love you.

1219
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:44,030
I love you.

1220
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:50,620
- [knocking]
- [Mrs. Farthing]
Kathryn, are you there?

1221
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,620
Kathryn, answer me!

1222
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:34,610
[Kathryn]
I can take one more question
before the signing begins.

1223
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:36,110
- Yes?
- Ms. Bennett.

1224
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:40,120
Your first book focused
on Peter Warren's
earlier career,

1225
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:44,120
writing kiss-and-tell books
under the name of
"Monty Briggs."

1226
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:47,130
Now you write about
Warren himself,

1227
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:51,130
saying that the inspiration
for his best-selling
horror novels

1228
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:54,130
comes from
his own delusions,

1229
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:57,640
that he is plagued by
the guilt-ridden ghosts

1230
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,640
of people whose trust
you claim he betrayed.

1231
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:04,640
What do you say to
your critics who feel
that your current work

1232
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:08,150
is just as exploitative as
the supermarket paperbacks

1233
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:11,650
that you criticize Warren
for having written?

1234
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:15,650
The truth must come out.
