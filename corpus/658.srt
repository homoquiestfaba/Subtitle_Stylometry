1
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,923
They called it the car for Everyman.

2
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,469
Henry Ford himself called it
a car for the "great multitude."

3
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:41,392
It was functional and simple,
like your sewing machine
or your cast-iron stove.

4
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,273
You could learn to drive it
in less than a day,

5
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,028
and you could get any color
you wanted, so long as it was black.

6
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,077
When Ford first conceived the Model T,
it took 13 hours to assemble.

7
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:05,333
Within five years, he was
turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds.

8
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,800
Of course, the real invention wasn't the car,
it was the assembly line that built it.

9
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,764
Pretty soon, other businesses
had borrowed the same techniques.

10
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,976
Seamstresses became button sewers.

11
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,896
Furniture makers
became knob turners.

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,858
It was the beginning and the end
of imagination...

13
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,361
all at the same time.

14
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,209
Howard?

15
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,130
- Charles, I'm talking to you.
- Hmm?

16
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,676
They need spokes,
same as the others.
They oughta make a better spoke.

17
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,345
Yeah? Then what
would you do?

18
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:29,769
It was a land of opportunity.

19
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,482
The country was shrinking,
and there was life
to be made out West...

20
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:38,152
for any man with drive
and ambition.

21
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,365
If your dream was big enough
and you had the guts to follow it,

22
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,285
there was truly a fortune
to be made.

23
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,630
How are you, sir?

24
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,887
Damn thing blew on me.
What?

25
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,932
It's a Stanley Steamer.
The boiler blew.

26
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,019
- Oh?
- Can you fix it?

27
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,439
Uh...

28
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,862
Sure. Sure, I can fix it.

29
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,774
This is an amazing machine.

30
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:42,234
It's got a two-stroke boiler system...

31
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,279
that's heated
by this huge fire grate.

32
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,034
I mean, it's...
Well, it's basically
a very small locomotive.

33
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,745
Thank you.
Now, I made
some improvements.

34
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:55,664
It wasn't your boiler that was blowing;
it was your bleed valve.

35
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,251
So, with increased pressure,
I can see you getting
up to 40 miles an hour.

36
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:04,089
Really?
Oh, yeah. And if you superheat the excess,
I can see you reaching...

37
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,592
Fifty, maybe 60 miles an hour.
Is that right?

38
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:11,388
Easily. And the thing
of it is, Mr. Coughlin,
you don't feed it,

39
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:16,602
you don't stable it, and unless
you hit a lamppost, the thing's not
gonna get sick and die on ya.

40
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:20,648
- That's funny.
- To tell you the truth,

41
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,985
I wouldn't spend more than five dollars
on the best horse in America.

42
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,156
This is not the finish line, my friends.
This is the start of the race.

43
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,078
The future is the finish line!
And the new Buick White Streak
is just the car to take us there!

44
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,583
Four in-line cylinders,
421/2 horsepower,

45
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:26,422
- Wonderful.
- This is the same car you can buy at any
of our five showrooms across the Bay Area.

46
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:31,760
- "The age of the automobile is here,"
boasted Howard."The future has arrived."

47
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,685
Oh, my.
Read the part about
the future again.

48
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,564
- Oh, I'm kind of
dealing with it right now.
- Oh, sorry. Here. I'll take him.

49
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,692
Come here, big guy.
Come here. Come here.

50
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,362
Oh, are you the future, huh?
Are you the future?

51
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,699
Are you gonna...

52
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,744
Are you going to the moon?

53
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:59,788
The moon! Whee!

54
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,376
I'll take it.

55
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,297
Do we really
need all this?
No. No. We don't need it...

56
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,385
There's also a caretaker's house,
a paddock, a barn,
some very nice stables.

57
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,429
How big are the stables?

58
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,840
Got it.

59
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,510
Settle down. Settle down.

60
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:57,930
Quit. Quit. Whoa. Whoa.

61
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:01,767
Whoa.

62
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,104
Whoa.

63
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,006
Come on, Dad.

64
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,803
Whoa.

65
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:50,524
There you go.

66
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:01,868
You're not getting him a horse.

67
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,871
Why not?
He's great at it.

68
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:08,834
Because he's 16 years old.
- So?

69
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,670
So... he should earn it.

70
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:18,010
All right.

71
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,680
- All... All right. Quiet.
- Everybody knows it.

72
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:24,224
Nobody knows Longfellow.
Dickinson.

73
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,852
Ooh!

74
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,690
"We never know how high we are..."

75
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,527
Oh, I know that.
Yeah. I know.

76
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,113
I know it.
Well?

77
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:45,203
"We never know
how high we are
till we are called to rise."

78
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,748
- Good.
- Very good, John.

79
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,876
"And then, if we are true to plan,
our statures touch the skies."

80
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:54,713
- Excellent.
- Yes!
- That's really good.

81
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,386
Uh-oh.

82
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,432
- "The heroism..."
- Right.

83
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:08,060
Right."The heroism..."

84
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,271
"The heroism we recite...

85
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,107
"would be a daily thing,

86
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:19,321
That's it.
"Did not ourselves
the cubits warp,

87
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:23,408
for fear to be a king."

88
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,459
You should be riding it.
You knew the poem.

89
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:38,173
Yeah. But he
looks so perfect out there,
doesn't he?

90
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:41,593
Yeah. He does.

91
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,097
That's the poetry
right there, Agnes.

92
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,516
That's the poetry.

93
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:52,479
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

94
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,482
I came here 15 years ago
with 21 cents in my pocket.

95
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,443
I know a lot of us at the table
have a story like that.

96
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:01,613
And, you know,
I can't help thinking...

97
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:07,160
that if we can start out there
and end up here, where can't we go
in America?

98
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:12,958
Hmm? So, as corny as it sounds,
I'd like to propose a toast
to the future.

99
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:18,421
Because out here, my friends,
the sky is literally the limit.

100
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,465
To the future!
To the future!

101
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,511
To the future!

102
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,995
There were no suicides
on Wall Street that day.

103
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,915
It was a myth
that would grow over time.

104
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:01,673
The real effect of October 29
took a little longer to sink in.

105
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,598
By noon, all the gains
of the previous year
had been obliterated.

106
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:15,270
By 4:00 p. M., nearly $10 billion
of market value was gone.

107
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:22,527
Over the next two weeks,
the hemorrhage continued.

108
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,701
And before long,
25% of the workforce was unemployed.

109
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,877
A great national migration began.

110
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:42,547
Displaced families
took to the American highway...

111
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:46,009
in the last possession
that remained to them:

112
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,054
Their automobile.

113
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,517
And all at once,
millions of Americans...

114
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:58,396
had a new definition of home.

115
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,800
I made two dollars today.

116
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:31,429
- What?
- I made two dollars.

117
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:34,265
Here.

118
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:41,356
Where did you get these?

119
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:48,321
Yeah, your boy combed 'em out,
changed all the tack. I didn't have
to tell him a thing.

120
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,120
- Hey, Red,
Attaboy!

121
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:58,206
Where'd a young fella
like you learn so much about horses?

122
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,501
His name's Johnny.

123
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,628
You can call me Red.

124
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,717
Whoo!

125
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:18,810
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

126
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:57,098
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

127
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:07,066
What's that?
Everything.

128
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,777
Dickens, Wordsworth.

129
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:15,033
There's your Arabian Nights
and Moby Dick, even your Milne,
from when you were...

130
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,620
Why? What's wrong?

131
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:22,832
Mr. Blodget here,
he has a house, a real house.
Dad... Dad, what's wrong?

132
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,043
- And his wife cooks.
- She is a good cook.

133
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:28,713
No. No. Shh. Dad. Shh.
There's even a phone next door.
We'll call you.

134
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:31,424
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you,
and we'll tell you where we are.
No. No.

135
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:34,761
We're just gonna go home,
all right? Let's go.
Listen to me.

136
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:39,057
You have a gift.
You have a gift.

137
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,519
Don't... Don't do this.

138
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,564
Dad, don't do this.
We'll be back.

139
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,161
Go on. Go with Mr. Blodget.
No.

140
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:03,915
He's gonna take care of you, sweetie.
Go with him.
Mom, don't do this.

141
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:32,485
I don't know. You still
look pretty tall to be a jockey.

142
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:36,322
I've never been over 115.

143
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,450
Where'd you learn
to ride like that?
Home.

144
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:44,038
All right.
Here's the way it works.

145
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:47,667
I pay you $10 a week to ride.
You owe nine dollars for your meals,

146
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,753
six dollars to sleep in the stalls,
three dollar tack fee.

147
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:54,048
That's the deal.
How do I pay all that back?

148
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,300
You win.

149
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:59,387
Ow!

150
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:06,310
You son of a bitch!
Get off of me!

151
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:29,458
Yah!

152
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:33,880
Get lost!

153
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:53,399
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

154
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,242
Get off of me!

155
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,921
A nose?
You lose a race a nose,
you'd better fall off tryin!

156
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:20,384
Here. Muck these stalls down,
every damn one of'em!

157
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:23,429
A nose!
For Christ's sake!

158
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:33,439
No. No, Bill.
I'm not gonna do it.
No more layoffs.

159
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:36,484
Well, it can't
get any worse.

160
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:40,655
Look, if it stays like this,
we'll just...

161
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:45,701
Bill, we'll be fine, really.
We will.

162
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:50,081
All right. I'll see you in town.

163
00:20:56,587 --> 00:21:00,800
Frankie, come on.
It's a glorious day outside.

164
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:04,637
- Why don't... Why don't you
go fishing or something?
- I'm reading.

165
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,475
You can read when it's raining.
Come on. I'll teach you to drive the truck.

166
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,104
You already taught me
to drive the truck.

167
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:16,148
- Well, what are you reading?
- Flash Gordon.

168
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:21,278
Come on, Dad. It's about the future!

169
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,955
We'll be in San Francisco
till Wednesday.

170
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:53,746
Yeah? What?

171
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:11,091
Come inside.
- I'm not done.

172
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,635
Sam can do that.

173
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:18,807
I don't want Sam to do it.
I want to do it.

174
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,687
- Annie.
- Don... Don... No!

175
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:33,322
Ma'am.

176
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:29,086
Come on, Red!
Come on!

177
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:21,805
At a time when the world
really needed a drink,

178
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:26,018
you couldn't get one
in the United States of America.

179
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:29,521
Liquor was illegal.
Diversions were scarce,

180
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:33,483
and there's just so much
a human being can do without.

181
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:37,779
Soon, the border town was born,

182
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:43,285
providing everything to the south
that their neighbor to the north
would not.

183
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:48,957
You could find anything:
Food, companionship,

184
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:54,463
decent gin,
and with gambling outlawed as well,

185
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:58,842
- the chance
to turn bad luck into good.

186
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:06,933
Relax! You got it!
You got it! You got it!

187
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:09,686
Go!

188
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:13,356
That jockey was ridin'
like he's got an anvil in his pocket.

189
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,527
I'm gonna bet
with you no more.
I no like it.

190
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,534
Who's that?

191
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:27,579
George Woolf,
greatest jockey in the world.

192
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:43,053
That's Charles Howard?
Yeah.

193
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,223
I thought
he came down here for a...
Quickie divorce?

194
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:50,810
- Why?
Look at him.

195
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:54,731
Nothing quick about that.

196
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:19,422
It was in the palace
of the great sultan.

197
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:23,468
Sultan of where?
The Sultan of Araby.

198
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,598
I'd been living there
for almost a year, racing his Arabians
across the desert by day...

199
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:32,269
and finishing my personal history
of the region by night.

200
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:38,108
Then one day, the sultan
summons me into his throne room.

201
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:41,236
He looks at me and says,

202
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,365
- "John Pollard..."
- "John Pollard,
you are my greatest jockey.

203
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:51,204
It is you I have chosen
to ride my hundred-mile race
from Kusmat to Tripoli."

204
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:55,166
200-mile.

205
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,128
All right. 200-mile.
Excuse me, sahib.

206
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:05,677
- You didn't need to wreck it, Georgie.
- When you started tellin' that story,
it was only 50 miles.

207
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,347
Yeah, well,
everything gets longer
in the retellin'.

208
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:12,892
Just ask your friend Wanda
over there.

209
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:16,771
You know, if you start ridin'
a little more and talkin' a little less,
you might start winnin' some races.

210
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:19,733
- I got two bucks says
I beat you in this one.
- I'm not sure if you do,

211
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:22,319
but I got five says I beat you.
Done.

212
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:30,326
- Give me odds.
You're the favorite.
- Even money.

213
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:33,538
- Nah! Forget it! Two-to-one!
- Fine.

214
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:37,584
You got it. Hey, Johnny.
You're on a speed horse. What
are you doin' back here with me?

215
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:41,004
I like the conversation,
and it's not a speed horse.
Don't try to hook me.

216
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,214
You goin' tonight?
Nah. You?

217
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,675
Nah.
What time?

218
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:49,429
I don't know. 8:00?
Okeydoke.

219
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:52,891
Oops. There's my hole!
Gotta go! Yah!

220
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:01,232
Goddamn it!

221
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,910
Whoa!

222
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:15,205
We got him!

223
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:19,751
- I'll take him.
- Get the hell out of here.

224
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:24,255
- I said, I'll take him.
- He's got a fractured foot.

225
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:27,091
If you're gonna shoot him anyway,
I'll save you the bullet.

226
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:33,765
- Whoa.
- Fine.

227
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:37,435
Let him go. Hey.
Let him have him.
Mira.

228
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,783
Now, bud.

229
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:59,833
Yeah, boy.

230
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:47,964
Okeydoke, Johnny.
There's the hole! Gotta fly!

231
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:56,347
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

232
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,897
There once was a princess
from Siam...

233
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:08,693
who was sitting here
sort of like I am.

234
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:14,490
I wined her and dined her,
and then I reclined her.

235
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:23,166
Ah, shit.
What rhymes with Siam?

236
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:26,169
That's great.
You make that up?

237
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,006
Pretty obvious, huh?

238
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:35,345
- That's beautiful.
- No. You're beautiful.

239
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:38,514
Don't say that.
You pay me.

240
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:46,355
So, you wanna... you know...

241
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,691
get going?

242
00:33:50,568 --> 00:33:53,112
Sure. Why not?

243
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:14,967
- How do you miss a hole like that?
- There's my hole! Gotta fly!

244
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:17,053
Are you blind?

245
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:26,854
Ngel, are you okay?

246
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:32,151
OI!

247
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:35,404
OI!

248
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,767
You don't wanna watch?

249
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:08,938
No. Not really.

250
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:13,526
I don't either.

251
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:18,114
OI!

252
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:25,329
So, what? They brought you
down here to make you feel better?
Is that it?

253
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,668
Yes. Sort of.

254
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:33,879
Those guys, they think
everything is fixed with a party.

255
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:39,468
I'm sorry. Who are you?

256
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:43,598
Oh. Marcela Zabala.

257
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:51,188
My sister, Isabella,
she's married...
No. No, no. I know.

258
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:55,192
Nice to meet you. Charles.
Mucho gusto.

259
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:11,417
So, do you feel better?

260
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:20,926
No. No, not really.

261
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,931
No. How could you?

262
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:28,851
With something like that.

263
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:05,846
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

264
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,599
Come on.

265
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:22,071
- Did I lose?
- Oh, no. You clobbered him.

266
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:28,285
Easy.

267
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:30,955
Easy, easy.
Nice and slow.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

268
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:33,040
Come on. Let me
buy you some turtle soup.
I'm fine, George.

269
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:37,086
Go win yourself a race or something.
Let's go down to Sloan's,
and we'll just...

270
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:41,757
I'm fine, George.
I don't need your help, and I sure
as shit don't need your charity.

271
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:47,346
Leave me alone,
all right?

272
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:56,939
It's been 20 years
since I've been on a horse.
Don't worry.

273
00:37:57,022 --> 00:38:00,276
It's the kind of thing
that comes right back.

274
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:22,631
Let's go.

275
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:33,309
Come on!

276
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:17,353
What? She got you back up on a horse,
and now you wanna buy 'em?

277
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:21,857
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe a couple.
You wanna win or just own 'em?

278
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:24,943
I wanna win.
What sort of question is that?

279
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:27,863
Well, you're gonna
need a trainer before
you buy horses.

280
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:31,033
No. You need two.
So you can fire one, eh?

281
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,541
Randy Thatcher's barn.
Trains about 50 or 60 ponies.

282
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:44,838
Good fella too.
Real horse person.
A real horse-shitter. Scusa.

283
00:39:44,922 --> 00:39:48,258
Now, now. I don't know.
Maybe you want a smaller barn,
somebody who can take the time to...

284
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:52,346
Who's that?
- Huh?

285
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:57,101
Oh, he's a crackpot.
Lives alone in the bushes.

286
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,895
What's he do?

287
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:05,651
I don't know. He used
to be a trainer, farrier. Now he just
looks after that horse.

288
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:10,280
Come on.
Let's look at another barn.

289
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,884
- Howdy.
- Hello.

290
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:39,309
Wh... You hungry?
No. No, thanks.

291
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:42,396
I'm fine.
Charles Howard.

292
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:45,607
Tom... Smith.
Nice to meet you, Tom.

293
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:52,030
What's... What's in his bandage?

294
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:59,371
Oh, that's hawthorn root.
It increases circulation.

295
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:03,250
You wanna sit down?

296
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,295
Oh. All right.
Thank you.

297
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:13,468
Will he get better?

298
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:16,597
Already is... a little.

299
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,143
Will he race?

300
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:24,938
No. Not that one.

301
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:29,651
So why are you fixing him?

302
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,820
'Cause I can.

303
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:39,161
Every horse
is good for somethin'.

304
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:43,248
He could be a cart horse
or a lead pony.

305
00:41:43,332 --> 00:41:46,376
And he's still nice to look at.

306
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,923
You know, you don't
throw a whole life away...

307
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,592
just 'cause
he's banged up a little.

308
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:10,275
Is that coffee?

309
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,319
Yeah.

310
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:20,535
It's bad, though.

311
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:23,288
You always tell the truth?

312
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:26,416
Well, I try to.

313
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:45,936
It ain't just the speed.
It's the heart.

314
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:50,023
You want something
that's not afraid to compete.

315
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:53,819
Half these horses
are just show ponies.

316
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:57,280
You want something
that's not gonna run from a fight.

317
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:02,244
How do you find that?

318
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:05,914
Look, I won the Robles Handicap.
I was second in the Tijuana Derby.

319
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:09,084
I won the Manzanita Oaks.
You know, that used to be a stakes race.

320
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,796
I know.
I would've won T.J.,
but the piece of shit lugged out on me.

321
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:18,260
- Sounds great. We'll let ya know.
- Look. I can work 'em out in the morning.

322
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:23,598
Or even hot-walk 'em
if you need me to.

323
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:27,352
Really? You'll hot-walk 'em?

324
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:30,689
This is somethin' else.

325
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:33,150
A dream come true,
walkin' you around.

326
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:37,779
Hook you up to a plow,
pull me around for a little while.
Come on.

327
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:41,992
You ever run in the money?
Huh?

328
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:45,036
Hey. Hey.
You ever run in the money?

329
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,040
I don't think so. Couldn't beat
a human being, let alone another horse.

330
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:54,004
You goddamn sack-of-crap
old plater.

331
00:43:54,087 --> 00:43:58,592
Probably the fastest
you're gonna run in your entire life,
you piece-of-shit old glue-pot.

332
00:43:58,675 --> 00:44:02,596
That's right.

333
00:44:20,155 --> 00:44:25,327
The first time
he saw Seabiscuit, the colt was walking
through the fog at 5:00 in the morning.

334
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:30,832
Smith would say later that the horse
looked right through him...

335
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:34,169
as if to say,
"What the hell are you looking at?

336
00:44:34,252 --> 00:44:39,090
Who do you think you are?"

337
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:41,927
He was a small horse,
barely 15 hands.

338
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,765
He was hurting too.
There was a limp in his walk,

339
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:50,352
a wheezing when he breathed.

340
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:53,021
Smith didn't pay attention
to that.

341
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:57,734
He was looking the horse
in the eye.

342
00:44:57,817 --> 00:45:01,613
God... damn.

343
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:12,374
He was the son of Hard Tack,
sired by the mighty Man O' War.

344
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:16,211
But the breeding did little
to impress anyone at Claiborne Farms.

345
00:45:16,294 --> 00:45:19,214
Get rid of him.

346
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:28,223
At six months,
he was shipped off to train with
the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons,

347
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:32,060
who, over time,
developed a similar opinion of the colt.

348
00:45:32,102 --> 00:45:35,897
Is that a racehorse
or a lead pony?

349
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:40,318
The judgment wasn't helped
by his gentle nature.

350
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:45,115
Where his sire had been a fierce,
almost violent competitor,

351
00:45:45,198 --> 00:45:48,159
Seabiscuit took to sleeping
for huge chunks of the day...

352
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:53,415
and enjoyed lolling for hours
under the boughs of the juniper trees.

353
00:45:53,498 --> 00:45:57,085
His other great talent was eating.

354
00:45:57,127 --> 00:46:02,507
Though half the size of other colts,
Seabiscuit could frequently
eat twice as much.

355
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,845
Fitzsimmons decided
the horse was lazy...

356
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:10,515
and felt sure he could train
the obstinance out of him.

357
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:15,019
I want you to hit him
as many times as you can
over a quarter of a mile.

358
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:19,441
When he didn't improve,
they decided the colt
was incorrigible.

359
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:23,903
They made him a training partner
to better horses,

360
00:46:23,987 --> 00:46:26,448
forcing him to lose
head-to-head duels...

361
00:46:26,531 --> 00:46:28,908
to boost the confidence
of the other animal.

362
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,120
By the time
he was three years old,

363
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:35,665
Seabiscuit was struggling
in two cheap claiming races a week.

364
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:41,463
Soon he grew as bitter and angry
as his sire Hard Tack had been.

365
00:46:43,923 --> 00:46:47,343
He was sold
for the rock-bottom price
of $2,000.

366
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:54,017
And, of course,
it all made sense.

367
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,896
Champions were large,
they were sleek,

368
00:46:57,979 --> 00:46:59,939
they were without imperfection.

369
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:05,403
When they finally did race him,
he did just what
they had trained him to do.

370
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:07,405
He lost.

371
00:47:09,866 --> 00:47:11,784
What exactly
is it you like?

372
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:14,871
He's got spirit.

373
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:17,498
I'll say.

374
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,378
Can... Can he be ridden?
Oh, sure.

375
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:28,968
Eventually.

376
00:47:29,052 --> 00:47:33,014
He can be
a little touchy.
Yeah, I got it.

377
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:35,683
No. Really.

378
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,769
I'm fine.

379
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:48,988
Jesus Christ!
That horse is nuts!

380
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,385
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

381
00:48:10,426 --> 00:48:12,428
Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!

382
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:26,359
Let's go!
Come on!

383
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:30,446
Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!

384
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,241
I'll take all of you!
Come on! Come on!

385
00:48:57,598 --> 00:49:00,476
It's okay.

386
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:05,314
I'm not afraid of you.

387
00:49:05,398 --> 00:49:08,401
Sure. I know.

388
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:13,030
I know what
you're all about.

389
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:22,373
You hungry?

390
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:26,753
Huh?

391
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:31,966
Yeah. Bet you are.

392
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:36,679
Huh? Come on.

393
00:49:36,763 --> 00:49:38,765
Come on, boy.

394
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:50,526
Yeah.

395
00:49:54,614 --> 00:49:57,742
Why don't you just
breeze him around
one turn.

396
00:49:57,825 --> 00:50:00,495
Give the folks a look.
Right.

397
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:05,416
Red Pollard,
Mr. And Mrs. Howard.
Yeah. Hi.

398
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,920
Hello.

399
00:50:09,003 --> 00:50:10,922
Well, we'll just
be movin' on.

400
00:50:16,844 --> 00:50:18,971
Does he breeze?

401
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:21,432
Well, we'll find out.

402
00:50:40,243 --> 00:50:42,787
Seems pretty fast.
Yeah.

403
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,872
In every direction.

404
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,502
Hell, he's so beat up,
it's hard to tell what he's like.

405
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,964
I just can't help feelin'
they got him...

406
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:55,591
so screwed up
runnin'in a circle,

407
00:50:55,675 --> 00:50:59,637
he's forgotten
what he was born to do.

408
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:04,016
He just needs to learn
how to be a horse again.

409
00:51:05,685 --> 00:51:08,229
Well, how do
you do that?

410
00:51:15,695 --> 00:51:20,157
How far do you
want me to take him?
Till he stops.

411
00:51:21,617 --> 00:51:24,245
Okay.

412
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,289
That seems like
a pretty good ride.

413
00:51:27,915 --> 00:51:30,793
Hope so.

414
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:50,312
That's it, boy.

415
00:51:50,396 --> 00:51:52,314
You're all right.

416
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:54,984
Let's see what you got, boy.
Ha! Ha!

417
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:58,529
Ha! Ha! Whoo!

418
00:51:58,612 --> 00:52:01,449
That's it, boy. That's it!

419
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,665
Yeah!

420
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,674
Whoo!

421
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:24,263
Whoo-hoo!

422
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:36,650
Well, at least
he wasn't expensive.
No. That's true.

423
00:52:39,737 --> 00:52:43,115
Whoo!

424
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:50,498
Goddamn it!
You're an amazing animal!

425
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:58,130
Whoo!

426
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:19,443
You can
come inside, you know.

427
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:22,696
I'm fine. Thank you.
Yeah,
you look it.

428
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:26,492
No, really, I'm fine.

429
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:30,496
Okay.
Suit yourself.

430
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:44,552
Welcome.

431
00:53:58,524 --> 00:54:01,110
Thank you.
You're welcome.

432
00:54:12,454 --> 00:54:14,456
It's okay.

433
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,459
Oh, I'm not that hungry.

434
00:54:17,543 --> 00:54:20,170
Mmm. Sure you're not.

435
00:54:21,463 --> 00:54:23,382
It's just a lot of food.

436
00:54:28,637 --> 00:54:31,181
It's okay.

437
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:33,600
Rather have you strong than thin.

438
00:54:57,332 --> 00:54:59,460
They called it "relief,"

439
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:01,378
but it was
a lot more than that.

440
00:55:01,462 --> 00:55:03,672
It had dozens of names:

441
00:55:03,756 --> 00:55:06,258
N.R.A., W.P.A.,

442
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:08,761
the C.C.C.

443
00:55:08,844 --> 00:55:11,597
But it really came down
to just one thing.

444
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:16,351
For the first time
in a long time,

445
00:55:16,435 --> 00:55:18,437
someone cared.

446
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:22,941
For the first time
in a long time,

447
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:25,486
you were no longer alone.

448
00:57:09,923 --> 00:57:12,593
Goat racing?

449
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:16,597
Oh, no. Just trying
to calm him down a little.

450
00:57:16,638 --> 00:57:19,516
Smart ones
hate being alone
all the time.

451
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,436
Oh.
And sometimes
another animal,

452
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:25,439
it just...
just soothes them a bit.

453
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:06,646
Pretty quiet in there.

454
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,316
What'd you do?

455
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:11,401
Go take a look.

456
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:22,871
Oh.

457
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:27,834
# Rock of ages, cleft for me #

458
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:32,923
# I am hid and safe in thee #

459
00:58:33,006 --> 00:58:37,928
# For the water
and the blood #

460
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:40,055
# From thy riven... #

461
00:58:40,138 --> 00:58:42,349
Okay. You don't
break him or anything,

462
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:45,435
but we gotta see
what he's got.

463
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:48,647
You take him
to the 5 pole...

464
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,024
and turn him loose.

465
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:54,194
Turn him loose?
Yeah, son.

466
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:56,279
He's a racehorse.

467
00:59:00,408 --> 00:59:02,786
Ha! Ha!
Come on!

468
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:11,336
Come on!

469
00:59:11,419 --> 00:59:15,465
Ha! Come on!
I know you got more than this!
Let's show 'em, boy!

470
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:22,264
How's he look?

471
00:59:22,347 --> 00:59:24,474
Asleep.

472
00:59:25,642 --> 00:59:29,521
Come on!
Let's show 'em, Pops!
Come on!

473
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:42,868
Whoo! There it is! Yeah!
Whoo!

474
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:45,078
Oh, my.

475
00:59:56,423 --> 00:59:59,092
Yeah, you and me! Let's go!

476
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:00,885
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

477
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:14,441
- Boy. Fast?
- Oh. Yeah.

478
01:00:14,482 --> 01:00:16,484
How fast?

479
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:21,239
Your horse just broke
the track record at Tanforan.

480
01:00:26,244 --> 01:00:28,788
Sometimes they...
they just, uh,

481
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:30,790
hanker for a little competition.

482
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:41,593
As long as we're talkin' long shots,
I got a real doozy for you, folks.

483
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:44,262
We got a horse
that's going off at 70-to-1,

484
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:46,306
and that's a short price, my friends.

485
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:49,434
This horse couldn't win
a church raffle, let alone
a $2,000 allowance.

486
01:00:49,517 --> 01:00:51,770
Yeah, talk about
a jump in class.

487
01:00:51,853 --> 01:00:53,813
This is the skunk
of the garden party.

488
01:00:53,855 --> 01:00:55,815
Yes, he's the surprise
in the punch bowl.

489
01:00:55,857 --> 01:00:59,903
As a matter of fact, I'll lay
even money that this nag, Seabiscuit,
couldn't even finish six furlongs.

490
01:00:59,986 --> 01:01:03,323
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin
live at Clockers' Corner.

491
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,746
Wow.
I wanted maroon.
They only had bright red.

492
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:12,999
Oh, it looks great.
You don't think
the "H" is too big?

493
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,418
You seen the size
of our jockey?

494
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:18,797
Come on.

495
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:31,976
Okay. Favorite's
that gray over there.

496
01:01:32,018 --> 01:01:34,020
He's got a big late charge,

497
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:38,650
so lock in early with him
and stay right off his flank.

498
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:42,529
Okay.
Once our boy sees
who the competition is,

499
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:44,531
he'll do most of the work.

500
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:46,533
But don't move
till that gray does.

501
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:48,701
What if it's late?

502
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:51,329
Let's go.

503
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:53,915
Twelve minutes to post.

504
01:01:53,998 --> 01:01:55,917
I don't think
it's gonna matter much.

505
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,670
Honestly.

506
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:30,702
- Come on in.
Number 3, Pollard on Seabiscuit.

507
01:02:33,204 --> 01:02:37,584
Hey, sahib.
Kinda small, isn't he?

508
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:40,295
Gonna look a lot smaller
in a second, Georgie.

509
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:42,171
I got five bucks
says he doesn't.

510
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,510
Starter's poised. The flag is up.

511
01:02:47,594 --> 01:02:51,389
And there they go.

512
01:02:51,431 --> 01:02:55,268
Pirate's Gold breaks first,
followed by Geronimo
on the outside.

513
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:58,646
Silver Treasure is third,
followed by Seabiscuit.

514
01:03:10,867 --> 01:03:13,202
They're coming by
the five-furlong pole.

515
01:03:13,286 --> 01:03:17,373
It's Pirate's Gold, Geronimo,
Hill's Army and Agua Dulce.

516
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:24,714
Whoa!

517
01:03:24,797 --> 01:03:28,259
Son of a bitch!
Ha! Ha!

518
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:31,804
Piece of shit bastard!

519
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:36,601
What the hell is he doing?

520
01:03:36,643 --> 01:03:39,479
...opening up a 3...
a 4-length lead...

521
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:41,356
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

522
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:44,484
I'm gonna put you on the rail,
you piece of shit!

523
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,529
- Get off of me!
- How do you like that,
you son of a bitch?

524
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:51,574
You're gonna drop me, man!

525
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:55,578
The two horses are flying down...
- You like the rail?

526
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:07,340
- Here comes the cavalry charge!
- Knock me off my horse!

527
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:11,344
It's Silver Treasure on the inside.

528
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:16,516
Silver Treasure on the inside.
Silver Treasure and Pirate's Gold.

529
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:19,977
And at the wire
it's Silver Treasure.

530
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,026
Aw, damn it.

531
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,195
What the hell
were you thinkin'?
He fouled me.

532
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:33,658
- What am I supposed to do,
let him get away with that?
- Well, yeah, when he's 40-to-1.

533
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:36,369
- He almost put me in the rail!
- Well, did he?

534
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:38,746
Look, we had a plan.

535
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:43,000
He fouled me, Tom!
What am I supposed to do?
He cut me off!

536
01:04:47,338 --> 01:04:49,549
He fouled me!

537
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,260
Son? Son.

538
01:04:54,178 --> 01:04:56,180
What are you so mad at?

539
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:10,194
There's a phone next door.
We'll call you.

540
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:12,905
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you
and tell you where we are.

541
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:16,325
No. We're just gonna
go home. All right?

542
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,086
You have a gift.

543
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,630
You have a gift.

544
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:38,931
I need to borrow some money.

545
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:45,188
All right.
I, uh,

546
01:05:45,271 --> 01:05:47,815
I haven't been to a dentist,
and m...

547
01:05:50,109 --> 01:05:52,445
Well, l-I need to borrow
some money.

548
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:56,240
- That's fine.
- I don't know when
I can pay you back.

549
01:05:57,408 --> 01:06:00,328
I mean, when we win.
When we win, I can pay you back.

550
01:06:00,411 --> 01:06:03,873
That is if you
still want me to ride.

551
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,210
Of course I want you to ride.

552
01:06:12,089 --> 01:06:14,008
How much do you need?

553
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:16,010
Uh,

554
01:06:17,637 --> 01:06:19,639
ten dollars.

555
01:06:20,806 --> 01:06:23,643
Here.

556
01:06:27,396 --> 01:06:30,149
Than... Uh...
It's fine.

557
01:06:36,322 --> 01:06:39,408
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

558
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:51,754
That's it, Pops.
We're okay now.
It's all right, boy.

559
01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:55,633
Yeah, we're okay.

560
01:06:55,675 --> 01:06:57,927
Nothing to worry about.

561
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,097
All the time in the world, boy.
That's it, Pops.

562
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,933
Nice lead.
Just like that, boy.

563
01:07:04,016 --> 01:07:05,518
Just like that.

564
01:07:08,979 --> 01:07:12,274
What do you think, boy?
You ready to go?

565
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:15,528
You and me.
Let's go, boy. Let's go. Ha! Ha!

566
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,831
Ha! Ha!

567
01:07:56,318 --> 01:07:58,446
Whoo!

568
01:07:59,864 --> 01:08:03,159
In the end, it wasn't the dams...

569
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:06,579
or the roads
or the bridges or the parks.

570
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:10,916
Or the tunnels
or the thousands
of other public projects...

571
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,002
that were built
in those years.

572
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:16,338
It was more invisible
than that.

573
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:20,301
Men who were broken
only a year before...

574
01:08:20,384 --> 01:08:22,386
suddenly felt restored.

575
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,807
Men who'd been shattered
suddenly found their voice.

576
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:29,435
Well, I just think
this horse has a lot of heart.

577
01:08:29,518 --> 01:08:31,729
He may have been down,
but he wasn't out.

578
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:34,857
He may have lost a few,
but he didn't
let it get to him.

579
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,318
We could all learn
a lick or two
from this little guy.

580
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:39,320
Oh, and by the way,
he doesn't know he's little.

581
01:08:39,403 --> 01:08:41,530
He thinks he's
the biggest horse out there.

582
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:44,783
- So you got big plans
for this little horse?

583
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,119
Oh, yeah. See, sometimes
when the little guy,

584
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:51,040
he doesn't know
he's a little guy,
he can do great big things.

585
01:08:51,123 --> 01:08:53,250
Can we get a shot here?

586
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:56,045
See, this isn't
the finish line.

587
01:08:56,128 --> 01:09:00,507
The future is the finish line,
and the Biscuit is just the horse
to get us there.

588
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:03,052
"Just the horse to get us there."

589
01:09:03,135 --> 01:09:05,846
You certainly made a believer
out of me, Mr. Howard.

590
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,848
It's time for this old tout
to eat some crow.

591
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:12,478
Four and 20 blackbirds,
to be exact, all baked up
in some humble pie,

592
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:14,647
and I'll take mine la mode.

593
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:17,191
Oh.

594
01:09:17,274 --> 01:09:19,360
And one more thing, Mr. Howard.
I just wanna say...

595
01:09:19,443 --> 01:09:22,529
Thanks for the champagne.
Don't mention it.

596
01:09:22,613 --> 01:09:24,657
Did you see the infield?
No, not yet.

597
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:28,077
Take a look.
Your little horse is sellin' out
the cheap seats.
