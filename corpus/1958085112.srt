1
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:14,616
- Hey Vinny, where the hell is
anybody?

2
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:15,817
I mean, nobody picked me up.

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,851
I just got out.

4
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,754
Forget about it!

5
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,990
Are you still over there in my
apartment?

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,958
In St. Augustine, Florida.

7
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,428
Well, I want you out,

8
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,732
and I hope you don't
fucking destroy the place.

9
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,300
Whoever this idiot is, Nick,
that was supposed to get me,

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,870
you tell that motherfucker
I wanna see him someday.

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,239
Forget about it.

12
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,407
I'll walk to Amarillo

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,944
and I'll get a fucking bus
all the way to Jacksonville.

14
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:43,811
Bye.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,446
Asshole.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,649
Motherfuckers.

17
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:47,709
- Thanks, babe.

18
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,543
Keep the change.

19
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:49,376
- Always, Baka.

20
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,511
- Every time.

21
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,245
- Hey, how you doing?

22
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,514
- Hey.
- How much?

23
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,381
- 5.60.

24
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,354
Thank you.
- Thank you.

25
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,900
- How you doing?

26
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,703
- I talked to the police today.

27
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,237
I hope you are not here

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,140
to bring more trouble
to my business, are you?

29
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,111
- Hey, 20 years, I can't get
hug?

30
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:23,978
Come here.

31
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,051
Look, I know you have my life.

32
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,318
What, you can't gimme a hug?

33
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,720
What the, I mean,

34
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:33,855
you gimme not much of a choice

35
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,590
if you're gonna do that, you
know?

36
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,592
What are you doing?

37
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,227
I can't say hello to you?

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,730
Back in New York, you'll
be calling me every day.

39
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:46,734
I mean, you gimme no choice.

40
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,936
- Give me the fucking money!

41
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,940
- What the hell's wrong with
you?

42
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,474
The fuck are you doing?

43
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:56,944
Trying to rob the place?

44
00:02:56,978 --> 00:02:58,245
You crazy kid!

45
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,648
What are you robbing for?

46
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,616
What do you need money for?

47
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,950
Drugs?

48
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:06,020
- I need the money for drugs.

49
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,822
I need medicine for my mom.

50
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,756
I need the money.

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,625
- Your mom?

52
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,760
I don't believe you.

53
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,662
- For drugs, for my mother.

54
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,663
She needs medicine.

55
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,231
- What is this?

56
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,702
- It's her
prescription.

57
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:21,569
- Prescription.

58
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,402
You were gonna be a nurse.

59
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,236
What is this?

60
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,609
- It's for a woman,

61
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,611
a very, very sick woman.

62
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,312
- Get up!

63
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,749
You wanna go to jail?

64
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,450
You wanna know what prison's
like?

65
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,986
It's hell, kid!

66
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,189
Every day you die in there!

67
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,658
You wanna go in there?

68
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,226
They'd take you out in one day.

69
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,167
Take this and go get
your mother's medicine,

70
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,672
and don't come within
a mile of this place.

71
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,674
I'll blow your fucking kneecaps
out!

72
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:00,708
Get outta here!

73
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,680
Stupid, fucking kid.

74
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,682
Isn't time to lock up?

75
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,050
It's late.

76
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,033
- Sit down.

77
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,671
- You're crazy.

78
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,774
I thought this was only
like this in New York.

79
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,276
- Why are you here?

80
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,947
What you want from me?

81
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,683
Why are you here?

82
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,252
Why are you back?

83
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,155
You wanted to start
another new family again?

84
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,526
Anthony, have you looked
in the mirror lately?

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,796
You are an old man.

86
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,564
You shouldn't,

87
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,934
you wanted to have a family.

88
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,171
I bet you don't know the whole,

89
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,039
guess what happened to Sophia,
do you?

90
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,073
- I know she's dead.

91
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,912
- When you owed the Italian
crime family

92
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:14,282
and you couldn't pay
back the debt you owed

93
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,083
because you were where you were,

94
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:20,621
the small masters made it
impossible for you to pay back.

95
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:24,292
I guess it's because the feud
existed

96
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,560
in between your groups.

97
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,995
They wanted to hit you really
bad.

98
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,031
Back in New York,

99
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:30,965
Sophia,

100
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,302
she tried everything
to get you out of that.

101
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,138
She stayed completely loyal to
you.

102
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,539
They didn't know she was
pregnant,

103
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,406
or,

104
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:46,280
they just decided to kill her
anyway with the pregnancy.

105
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:49,550
I'm not telling you that to
bring you back bad memories.

106
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:53,420
I just, I don't want you to die

107
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,625
in cold blood like Sophie
and your unborn baby.

108
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,461
I couldn't get over that
for a very long time.

109
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,897
I really love you, man.

110
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,933
I just don't want you
to do anything stupid.

111
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,870
- But I gotta tell you what
happened for real in New York.

112
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,439
When the Don died,

113
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,841
after he took out Sophie,

114
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,646
I had him die like the
animal he is on the street.

115
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:27,088
And then his young wife, Gloria,

116
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,488
she became LaDonna.

117
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,126
She's the most evil bitch you
ever met.

118
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,462
She's not human.

119
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:37,531
The things she does,

120
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,699
I won't even repeat,

121
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,234
but I'm not here for revenge.

122
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,070
If they don't with fuck with me.

123
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,908
But if they come near you or me,

124
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,076
I'll kill 'em all.

125
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,015
- I don't wanna see you again.

126
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,851
I don't want you to come here
again.

127
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,154
I want you to stay away.

128
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,222
You understand?

129
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,658
I care about you,

130
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:04,525
so here,

131
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:09,063
here's a key to my apartment.

132
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,434
I'm gonna be leaving for
a vacation for two months,

133
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,238
just in case you need to hide.

134
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,839
It's not because I give a shit,

135
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:19,874
but I give a shit.

136
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,177
Now get the hell outta here.

137
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:24,245
Now.

138
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,080
- Thanks, Kitty.

139
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,928
- What the hell happened here?

140
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,597
Are you kidding me?

141
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:25,906
Won't be needing this in
Florida.

142
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,175
Look at this place!

143
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,780
Vito, never, ever again

144
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,048
do you come here again.

145
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,584
What the hell?

146
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,352
Stay in Brooklyn, you idiot.

147
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:41,989
Jesus.

148
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:08,783
Sophie.

149
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,934
Sophie.

150
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,380
I love you, Sophie.

151
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,247
I do.

152
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:43,518
I love you.

153
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,925
- Hey, where the hell is
Giuseppe?

154
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,161
Giuseppe, I'm not here to suck a
dick.

155
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:55,763
I'm here to make some money.

156
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,666
What the fuck is wrong with you?

157
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,067
What are you laughing at?

158
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,603
What you got for me?

159
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,909
I didn't ask you for cash.

160
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,377
I don't give a shit about that.

161
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,046
I want what's in the little box.

162
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,551
You see what's here in this
little box?

163
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:20,254
It worth more than all
you goombas put together.

164
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,723
Now you listen to me.

165
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,859
I wanna hit on Tony.

166
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,393
You think 'cause I'm a broad

167
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,895
you don't have to respect me?

168
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,898
You motherfuckers,

169
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,867
if my husband was still alive,

170
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,435
you'd all be dead.

171
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,171
Now you listen to me.

172
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:41,675
You take that reward from 25 to
50K.

173
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,679
I want Anthony D'Angelo dead.

174
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,949
I don't want him to know
this hit came from my family,

175
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,251
you bunch of mooks.

176
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,553
I want him dead.

177
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:55,422
I don't care if you've got hire
a jig or a fucking Russian,

178
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,893
get a wussie or a fucking
Mick to shoot him.

179
00:10:58,926 --> 00:10:59,793
I don't care.

180
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,296
Get a fucking leprechaun if you
have to.

181
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,432
Hey Sal, put this in the safe.

182
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,770
Now get the fuck outta here.

183
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,441
- Boss, I got the perfect jig.

184
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:15,943
I'll call 'em right now.

185
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,551
- I need some pussy after
those fucking mooks.

186
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,457
- You know,

187
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,860
you used to love taking
this carriage ride, honey.

188
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,630
Used to love coming by the old
cods.

189
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:37,064
Used to love it here, honey.

190
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,200
Remember?

191
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:43,771
Used to love coming by the
library and the castle.

192
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,606
What the?

193
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,240
Who the hell are you?

194
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,810
Hey, this guy's going to
knock you off this ride.

195
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:50,945
You're gonna be in jail

196
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,146
unless let you get off right
now.

197
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,013
What do you want?

198
00:11:54,782 --> 00:12:00,487
- I know you.

199
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,524
- I'll call the cops.

200
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:03,357
- No, it's okay, sir.

201
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,191
Don't worry about it, sir.

202
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,627
It's just a bum.

203
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,827
I got it handled.

204
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,662
I promise.

205
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:08,530
It's okay.

206
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,036
- What do you think,

207
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,738
I'm some gangster?

208
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:20,542
Ghetto fool?
- You want a cigarette?

209
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,876
- Not me.

210
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,378
- I'll give you a whole box.

211
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,547
What do you want?

212
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,384
- You're a master planner
and the best thief

213
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:35,289
someone like me could only pray
to meet.

214
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:42,229
Me and you go back further then
you could possibly imagine.

215
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,701
Remember back,

216
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:53,040
a child and his mother
crossing the Mexican border,

217
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,511
starving and hungry,

218
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:01,549
and you gave that boy a job as a
gardener.

219
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,350
- Ocho?

220
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:04,686
- The one and only!

221
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,520
- We were like this.

222
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:06,688
What happened to you?

223
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:07,921
You's just a skinny kid.

224
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,758
Look at you.

225
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,593
You grew up.
- That's right.

226
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,431
Ocho rose,

227
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,466
rose,

228
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,367
rose,

229
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:26,006
and now I run shit.

230
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,242
- Well, that's all good.

231
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,076
You want a hundred bucks?

232
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,010
All right, I'll give it to you.

233
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:30,978
I gotta go, all right?

234
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:36,450
- I have the means for
your financial good.

235
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:42,156
You should get an Oscar for
that job you did in Spain.

236
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,925
You robbed that town blind.

237
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,628
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

238
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:47,928
- Please come out.

239
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,899
I know he's still in there.

240
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,202
- Get your fucking hand off me.

241
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:59,206
- Yes, yes, yes!

242
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,642
You still have it!

243
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,277
You still have it.
- How does this happen

244
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,111
to me?

245
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,580
How does this happen?

246
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:06,447
- Look,

247
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,882
don't worry.

248
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,151
If I was gonna shoot you,

249
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,386
I would've already had.

250
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,189
Opportunity.

251
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:17,826
Call me.

252
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,294
You need me.

253
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,003
Sophie,

254
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,606
why don't you help me?

255
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,873
All these nuts around me.

256
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,691
Go away.

257
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:53,994
Who is it?

258
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:54,863
Get lost!

259
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,267
Knocking like a nut.

260
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:02,871
Who is it?

261
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,975
What do you want?

262
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,177
I have no disrespect, ma'am,

263
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,179
but I'm not a Jehovah's witness.

264
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,882
I'm a Catholic, all right?

265
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,315
- My name's Angela.

266
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,150
Call me Angie.

267
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,685
I'm here, your housekeeper.

268
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,520
- Housekeeper?

269
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,254
I didn't order no housekeeper.

270
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,157
- Are you gonna invite me in,

271
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,894
or are we gonna spend here
all day here in this space?

272
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,696
- I didn't order nobody.

273
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,532
Are you a cop?

274
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:31,498
Oh, Vito!

275
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,867
That's it.

276
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,569
Vito called you, right?

277
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,671
Vito called you.

278
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:37,572
He should.

279
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,074
How much is your rate?

280
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,149
What's your rate?

281
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,419
- I can't believe a human being

282
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,922
actually lives in this place.

283
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,061
You look familiar.

284
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,396
Are you a killer?

285
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,932
Are you a bad guy?

286
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,098
- You know, you're
making fun of an Italian

287
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,266
in his own home,

288
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,401
and that's not very smart.

289
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,435
And what is this, a mic?

290
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,303
What are you, a cop?

291
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,605
You gonna arrest me?

292
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:11,438
No, you can't,

293
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:12,439
'cause I just got out.

294
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,908
You got nothing on me.

295
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:16,210
- I didn't ask you about your
history.

296
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,947
But since we're doing that,
I used to be a doctor.

297
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,515
I came from Mexico.

298
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,817
My brother brought me here.

299
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,553
I am a woman with class.

300
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,956
Why am I even doing this with
you?

301
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,924
Do I have the job, yes or no?

302
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,024
I don't have all day.

303
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,927
- Oh with that attitude,
I'm gonna give you a job?

304
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,094
What are you?

305
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:34,929
What's going on with you?

306
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:35,897
What are you, nuts?

307
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,065
- I keep things professional
with my clients,

308
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:43,270
and clearly you need
someone to take care of you

309
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,304
and this place.

310
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,573
- Who contacted you?

311
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,945
- In time you will know.

312
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,046
I can start work tomorrow.

313
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:54,816
- No, not tomorrow.

314
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,283
I got business tomorrow.

315
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,285
I'll see you on Monday if you're
lucky.

316
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,926
- Hey, Nico.

317
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,927
Julia, look at this guy.

318
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,962
Look at this guy!

319
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:08,863
- Good to see you, Uncle Tony.

320
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:09,998
- Good to see you too.

321
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,934
- Hi, Uncle Tony!
- Hey, there she is!

322
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:13,768
Good to see you.

323
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:14,602
Look at that face.

324
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:15,435
I seen pictures.

325
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,871
You sent all those pictures.

326
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,071
Angela, how you doing?

327
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:18,940
- Hello, Uncle Tony.
- Hi.

328
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,340
Good to see you.

329
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,643
What's your dad doing?

330
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,845
- He's, uh.
- He's on the phone.

331
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:24,812
Business, right?

332
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:26,413
- It's so great to see you.

333
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,282
We've seen you all in the
newspapers.

334
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,818
You're a legend!

335
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:31,853
You are famous!

336
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:34,789
I've seen you all over
the newspapers for years.

337
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:38,191
We haven't been to Long
Island in such a long time.

338
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,827
- You're in Puerto Rico now,
right?

339
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,029
- Yeah.
- Living like kings

340
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,362
over there.

341
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,297
- I miss it,

342
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,666
but you should come down visit
sometimes,

343
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,334
especially 'cause you just got
out of the slammer and all.

344
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,004
- Oh, Tina.

345
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,039
Come, come.

346
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,842
- Hey, Francesca.

347
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,911
- Tony, it's so great to see
you.

348
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,546
- Hey, you looking lovely as
usual.

349
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,413
- Thank you.

350
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:05,218
- Nico Jr, you hit the grand
slam out of the park, huh?

351
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,588
- Thank you, Uncle Tony.

352
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:08,656
I saw your newspaper
clipping in Long Island.

353
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,358
I thought you were the
best thief out there, man.

354
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,192
- Yeah, okay.

355
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,160
- Hey, hey.

356
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,763
Okay, I'll call you back.

357
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,303
Won't you sit down?

358
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,672
Let's have a bottle.

359
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:25,506
A bottle,

360
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,340
a glass of wine.

361
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,307
- Kids, you know,

362
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,010
- They're grown.

363
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,078
Look at 'em grown up.

364
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:31,746
- How you doing?

365
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,347
- Let me take them to the walk.

366
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,550
Come on, kids.

367
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,151
- All right, honey.
- See ya, kids.

368
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,419
- Thank you.
- I'll go.

369
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,656
- I'm just gonna talk to my
brother for about 20 minutes.

370
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,057
I'll see you later.

371
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,224
I'll see you later.

372
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,392
- Tony, always.

373
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,432
- What are you doing?

374
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,968
What are you doing here in
Florida?

375
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,171
- Hey, the kids, must be nice.

376
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,042
Yeah, I wish I would've
seen them all those years.

377
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:01,876
They look great.

378
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:02,744
I'm proud of you.

379
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:13,387
Nothing like Uncle
Augustino's, but it'll do.

380
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,390
- Uncle Augustino's wine was
great.

381
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,793
This tends to cost a little bit
more.

382
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,628
Now tell me,

383
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,998
honestly, what the hell are
you doing here in Florida?

384
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,035
- You know, I think you
know what I'm doing here.

385
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:28,770
- Are you here to see LaDonna?

386
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,073
You still have this fucking
vendetta

387
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,575
that you've been carrying
inside of you like a poison

388
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,810
to avenge Sophie?

389
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,612
Is that why you're here in
Florida?

390
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,747
Let me tell you something,

391
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:43,151
if you come up against
her, you're gonna lose.

392
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,317
You're just like pop.

393
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,188
You're always out for revenge.

394
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,590
You have no fear.

395
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,459
And I don't want to bury another
one of my family members.

396
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,095
You could go anywhere you want.

397
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:57,131
California, Chicago,

398
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:58,599
Vegas even.

399
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,168
Everything's wide open.

400
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,170
But if you come up against
LaDonna,

401
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:06,507
with all the manpower that she's
built in the last 20 years,

402
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,743
that's why I'm here, brother.

403
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,812
I'm here to save you from
yourself.

404
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:13,848
I made a promise to pop to look
after you.

405
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,185
On his deathbed I swore to him

406
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,654
that I would protect you, and
guide you,

407
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,288
and look after you.

408
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,123
Come work with me.

409
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,991
Come to Puerto Rico.

410
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,292
You could be my partner.

411
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:27,294
You could start a new family,

412
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,696
meet a new woman,

413
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,330
have some kids of your own.

414
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,502
- Nico, I'm not leaving St.
Augustine

415
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:37,205
until I get justice for Sophie.

416
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,673
You got that?

417
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,411
- I know you're not afraid of
dying,

418
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,347
you thick headed, son of a
bitch.

419
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,618
Just like pop.

420
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,754
What the fuck is wrong with you?

421
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:53,888
Don't walk away that way.

422
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,490
It's been a long time since I've
seen you.

423
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:58,391
You just have a death wish,
don't you?

424
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:03,330
- Okay, you take care of your
kids.

425
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,398
You take care of your family.

426
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,034
You take care of me.

427
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:07,902
I love you, kid.

428
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:13,207
- You are my family, you
stubborn son of a bitch!

429
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,316
- Who are you?

430
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,317
What are you doing here?

431
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:27,255
Don't think I won't shoot.

432
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,089
What's your name?

433
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:28,923
Who are you?

434
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:29,891
- It's me, Angie.

435
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:30,892
You saw my brother.

436
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:31,893
I resumed today

437
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,995
because you didn't call
me to resume last week.

438
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:36,230
I tried to get a hold of you,

439
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,166
but you weren't anywhere around.

440
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,432
The screen door was open.

441
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,467
You told me to come.

442
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,502
Did you forget?

443
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:43,771
- The screen door was open?

444
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,472
Sit down.

445
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,277
The hell's wrong with you?

446
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,145
Can't believe I left the screen
door open.

447
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,214
I'm losing my mind with all this
pressure.

448
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:54,314
Can't believe this.

449
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,250
You know, you could have been
killed.

450
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:57,450
- I know who you are.

451
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,588
The legendary thief of the
nineties.

452
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,891
I know you're not a killer,

453
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:05,626
but you can if the need arises.

454
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:09,130
My brother and I met
after your first meeting.

455
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,932
He's not my favorite
person, I must confess.

456
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:13,601
We met and I needed to pick
something from a friend.

457
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:14,769
He accompanied me there.

458
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:16,604
I saw some files in his hand.

459
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,707
I went through the details and
I saw who you actually are.

460
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,908
You need me.

461
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,245
He brought me to your apartment
to become a cleaner for you.

462
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:27,114
I am very resourceful, trust.

463
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,217
- Maybe I'll trust you, but you
know what?

464
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,687
I didn't know you guys
were related at all.

465
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,155
This better not be a set up.

466
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:35,890
- What?

467
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:36,757
- Yeah, what?

468
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,264
All right, it's time I
met your brother again.

469
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,800
It's time he became my friend.

470
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,735
I need friends right now.

471
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:50,605
- I can make that happen
without any delay.

472
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:53,341
He's with a client at the moment
though.

473
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,177
Once I'm done with the
cleaning of the whole place?

474
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,212
- All right, you did a good job.

475
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,446
How long you lived here?

476
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,815
- Six years tomorrow.

477
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,651
But it's late

478
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,519
and it's a long way home.

479
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:06,621
- Well maybe, you know,

480
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:08,623
since we gotta do this
business with your brother

481
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:09,456
and all that,

482
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,391
maybe you stay here?

483
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,127
I mean, it's up to you.

484
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,795
- Hmm, I can do that.

485
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,797
Is it okay if I stay in the
guest room?

486
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:18,566
There's no guest room,

487
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,836
but you can stay in my bedroom
right behind the French doors

488
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,105
and I'll sleep on the couch, all
right?

489
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,339
- Can I trust?

490
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:27,108
- Yeah, you want me to trust
you?

491
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:27,909
You gotta trust me.

492
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:29,844
It's a two-way street, all
right?

493
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:31,345
- Maybe you can teach me to be

494
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:35,349
a very smart and creative thief
like you?

495
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:36,517
I mean,

496
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,286
I bet it'll be so much fun.

497
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,222
- You know, you remind
me so much of Sophia.

498
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,290
She was a lot like you,

499
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:43,891
funny like that.

500
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:45,660
Except she had a thick Mexican
accent.

501
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,128
How come you don't have one?

502
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,063
- My brother and I spend most of
our time

503
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,866
growing with the Americans
that came to the country.

504
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,869
I can hardly remember ever
spending time with kids like us.

505
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,737
I spent time with the American
doctors

506
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,839
and I loved medicine since then.

507
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,408
I've always imagined that

508
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,511
I'll probably go on an
adventurous
trip with a man I love.

509
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:04,612
- Sounds beautiful.

510
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,848
- I wish to run away again

511
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:11,185
from the drug cartel
my brother works with.

512
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,386
- Yeah, well, it's kind of
strange

513
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,989
how he meets me on a
horse and you're here now.

514
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,933
- I really want a different
life.

515
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:29,770
Very beautiful.

516
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,274
Very.

517
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,342
I'm a mess right now.

518
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,944
I, uh..

519
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,183
20 years inside there
does something to you,

520
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:43,017
believe me.

521
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:45,353
I, um..

522
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,657
a part of me died when Sophia
died.

523
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,126
I'm sorry.

524
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:10,978
Sophia taught me a few words

525
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:11,979
like,

526
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,481
but I, I'm Italian.

527
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,116
I don't speak Spanish, sorry.

528
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:16,717
- I mean, all black?

529
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:17,952
Why not add some color?

530
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:18,986
- When Sophia died

531
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,456
I promised myself I would
wear black every day

532
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:27,495
until I learned how to live
again.

533
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,530
- We've all have something we've
lost,

534
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:33,034
but we lose to gain something
back.

535
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,402
We have to keep living.

536
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:36,904
You can call it a gutsy
movement.

537
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:41,008
I call it whatever it feels in
my heart.

538
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:44,111
It's never too late to open your
heart.

539
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:46,347
- Get outta here, kid.

540
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,715
I'm too old for you.

541
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:49,518
Good night.

542
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,392
- You know, you really are a
nice person.

543
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,961
- Not all the time.

544
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:01,829
- Good night.

545
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:10,337
- Lights out.

546
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:21,682
Hey!

547
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,018
Hey, Jimmy!

548
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,319
- Hey.
- Yeah.

549
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:28,823
Gimme two grand on the
Tigers, plus two points.

550
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:29,657
- What you talking
about?

551
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,491
The spread ain't that.

552
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:31,192
- What the hell you talking
about?

553
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:31,992
- It's only one.

554
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,794
- What do you mean, one point?

555
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:34,595
In the papers it's plus two.

556
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:35,463
What the hell you,

557
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,897
get the fuck outta here.

558
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:38,432
- Spread New York's one
point.

559
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,835
- No, I'm not doing it
unless you gimme two points.

560
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:41,836
Forget about it.

561
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:43,938
- All right, all right,
all right.

562
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:44,805
You got two.
- All right.

563
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,806
That's more like it.

564
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,807
All right.

565
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:47,842
I got some guests coming in.

566
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,076
Talk to you later.

567
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:51,612
Hey, there they are.

568
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,718
Look at that.

569
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,720
Ocho, how you doing?

570
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:00,555
Look at this.

571
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,289
Coming to my house like old
times.

572
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:04,058
Hey Angie, you wouldn't believe
this.

573
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,159
When he was a kid,

574
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,561
your brother, when he was young,

575
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,663
he used to come by my place
in New York, him and his mom.

576
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,365
God bless your mother's soul.

577
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:15,369
I used to leave a $5 bill
underneath this pillow, right?

578
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:16,605
And he knew I knew

579
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:20,674
that he knew that I knew he
was taking it every time.

580
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:23,377
I don't forget things like that.

581
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,480
That little five you
slipped out every time.

582
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:28,115
- You know,

583
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,884
I brought you a gift

584
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:35,022
because I know how you
Guineas love your garlic.

585
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:37,825
You bathe in that shit, huh?

586
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,026
- Hey, what is this,

587
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,294
from Naples or what?

588
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,362
- No.

589
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:43,931
- The half a dollar store
from down the street?

590
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,268
Thank you very much.

591
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:48,702
Now you,

592
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:52,873
you have to have some of my
Uncle Augustino Iadellie's

593
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:54,775
red, basement wine.

594
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,944
- The basement, huh?

595
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:59,313
- Yeah, we also make sausage.

596
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:04,318
Gets you high, buddy.

597
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:06,187
- Shit.

598
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:08,623
Not bad.

599
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:11,792
- Now look, let me ask you a
question.

600
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:15,429
Did you set me and Angie up?

601
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:16,665
I'm just being frank.

602
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,165
Just tell me the truth,

603
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,634
and you know, I love her, so
it's okay.

604
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:20,467
I don't care.

605
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,004
- Actually,

606
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,408
kind of wondering why,

607
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:28,809
why the fuck she's here.

608
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:31,378
Huh?

609
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:34,281
I'm surprised at that.

610
00:28:34,315 --> 00:28:35,149
- I'm not.

611
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,420
- Hey, look.

612
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:43,224
It's all okay, all right?

613
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:48,162
- You wanna be in men's
conversations?

614
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,163
You know the drill.

615
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,201
- Well, look, I mean it's okay.

616
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:55,035
Put them on.

617
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:55,869
You know why?

618
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:56,705
Because it protects you.

619
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,539
You don't know anything,

620
00:28:57,572 --> 00:28:58,372
you can't say anything.

621
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,206
Nobody could ask you.

622
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,474
Hey, look, when I was young,

623
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,476
you know, my pops wouldn't
even let a woman in a room

624
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,477
when we were talking business.

625
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:04,812
So it's just, it's normal.

626
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:05,846
It's natural.

627
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:06,715
I love you.

628
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:12,119
- He does it every time he
talks about cartel business.

629
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:13,354
I'm used to it anyways.

630
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:16,658
- First of all,

631
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,994
did I come for a grand
inquisition?

632
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:21,730
Huh?

633
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,497
What are you gonna ask next?

634
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,466
What color my jonnies are?

635
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:26,900
Huh?

636
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:27,935
What is this?

637
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:32,039
Did you bring me here to
interrogate me?

638
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:35,943
What you wanna know?

639
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,545
My sign?

640
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:40,414
I'm a Libra.

641
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,549
- I want this to work out,

642
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,884
but I gotta know what
the you're talking about.

643
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,453
Number one, I got a problem
with LaDonna over there.

644
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:48,455
You know, LaDonna from New York.

645
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:49,724
The girl's an asshole already.

646
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,492
She's getting worse the older
she gets.

647
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,695
And now she's down in St.
Augustine.

648
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:55,296
I'm gonna have to look
for a job as a gardener

649
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,163
with you pretty soon

650
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:57,732
if I don't get something going
here,

651
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:58,866
you know what I mean?

652
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,602
You're afraid

653
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:01,435
of LaDonna?

654
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,903
- I ain't afraid of nobody.

655
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,674
I'm too stupid to be afraid of
people.

656
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:10,277
- There he is.

657
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,781
There he is.

658
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,149
I knew you were in there.

659
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:20,454
That's why I followed you.

660
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,090
That's why I came.

661
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:25,025
That's why I came.

662
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:28,262
I got a sweet deal for us.

663
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,598
- All right, look,

664
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:31,432
let's get off the bullshit.

665
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:33,033
Just jump to the gig, will you?

666
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,203
- We're talking about diamonds.

667
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:40,709
Pretty, little diamonds.

668
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,945
Not that crypto shit.

669
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:47,582
That stuff you can't see.

670
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:49,950
Old school, baby.

671
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,919
Old school.

672
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:53,153
You ready for this?

673
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,823
'Cause I'm talking 400,000.

674
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,627
How would you wops say it?

675
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:01,929
Calzones.

676
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:06,668
I am your Mexican connection.

677
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:09,336
Hey?

678
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,304
- You woke me up.

679
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:12,272
All that's good, you know,

680
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:14,743
and I think LaDonna,

681
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,344
she's got connection in South
Africa

682
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,581
with blue-white diamonds,

683
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,683
the most expensive diamonds in
the world.

684
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,184
But that woman is a snake.

685
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,554
Are you sure about the intel?

686
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:35,095
- Oh, I could smell that money
already.

687
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,197
I know you wops love your money,

688
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,701
just like us Mexicans.

689
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:44,739
Oh, we loves putitas,
pinatas, and mama's cooking.

690
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,412
- Yeah, but you know, Ocho,

691
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,914
you know, I'm very proud of you,
you know?

692
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:57,384
You become a big landscaper and
all that,

693
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,053
but this is like a real high end
heist.

694
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,523
You know what I mean?

695
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:03,924
And this ain't no fucking liquor
store,

696
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,727
you know what I mean?

697
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,030
- You don't have that drive
anymore.

698
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,232
Maybe you're just too old.

699
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:18,873
Maybe the younger lion, it's
ready.

700
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,041
It's time for him to strike.

701
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:23,277
People fear me all over the
world.

702
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:26,346
All over the world.

703
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:30,417
- Ocho,

704
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:33,387
fear doesn't give us any money,

705
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:35,322
any money.

706
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:38,827
- You're right.

707
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:43,598
You're right, you got a point.

708
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:45,265
- You know what?

709
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,133
I say,

710
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:52,574
we drink and celebrate to
the fact that I accept.

711
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,445
- Uh!

712
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,581
- Hey, just one thing.

713
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,483
I want you to know that I
promise you

714
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,387
that I will not exploit
your youth and inexperience.

715
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:48,596
- What?

716
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,364
You never seen a man
in boxer shorts before?

717
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:07,147
- Who do you think you are?

718
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,183
I've been trying to get
things done, like always,

719
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:13,053
and you have been acting cold to
me.

720
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:15,990
God.

721
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,359
I've been simply falling for you

722
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,161
and you've been acting like a
jerk.

723
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:27,301
Why don't you just grow up?

724
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,737
You've been walking around
that house in boxers

725
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:31,039
with a bowl of cereal.

726
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:36,076
- Hey, I'll eat cereal in
my house any time I want.

727
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,311
I'll wear boxers.

728
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:38,913
You don't need to tell me what
to do.

729
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:41,015
The hell's wrong with you?

730
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:48,957
- Dear me,

731
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,858
he definitely needs to clean up.

732
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:55,195
Huh,

733
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:56,965
Yankee drinks coffee.

734
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:01,168
Let's see some tea around here
somewhere.

735
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,904
Earl gray, man.

736
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:09,276
- I'm gonna dislocate
your fucking shoulder.

737
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:10,143
Who the fuck are you?

738
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:10,945
Are you ready?

739
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:11,779
- Ah!

740
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:14,414
Please refrain from breaking my
arm.

741
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:15,248
- Fuck you.

742
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,084
It's already dislocated.

743
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:16,951
Who are you?

744
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,321
- My name is Lawrence Windsor.

745
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:25,960
I do apologize, but Ocho sent
me.

746
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:27,260
- Ocho sent you to my house?

747
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,731
I never told him to send you to
my house.

748
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:32,466
- Yeah, but I'm actually part
your team.

749
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:33,367
- Get up.

750
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,638
I coulda shot you, you stupid
bastard.

751
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:39,107
- I know.

752
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:41,676
Excuse me a moment.

753
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:46,914
- Well, I know how to dislocate
'em,

754
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:47,749
but I don't know that trick.

755
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,050
How'd you put it back?

756
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,450
Where'd you learn that from?

757
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:56,323
- I was a doctor for 20 years
in the Special Air Service.

758
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:59,393
So I know how to do
things with one's anatomy.

759
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:00,160
- All right, what's the plan?

760
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:01,963
What's next?

761
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:04,966
- Well, I was told to
bring you to the location.

762
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:08,335
So, do you mind if we go now?

763
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,807
- This should be it. There he
is.

764
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:16,144
- Speak of devil.
- Gentlemen,

765
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:19,446
apologies for my tardiness.

766
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,615
Please be upstanding.

767
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:24,152
In fact, may I introduce
you to the one, the only,

768
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:27,789
Mr. Anthony Angelo.

769
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:28,923
- D'Angelo.

770
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,458
This place safe?

771
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:32,894
- Of course it's safe.

772
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:35,930
Would I bring you to a place
where the cops would get you?

773
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:36,931
Come on, man.

774
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:38,966
It's his place.

775
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,834
It's good.

776
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:41,769
- Lock it up.

777
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:45,673
Pull the divider in front of the
door.

778
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:46,607
Nobody can see in.

779
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:52,747
Pull it the way across,

780
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,715
all the way across.

781
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:56,283
- So what's you think?
- Hold on.

782
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:57,484
- Of our little rag tag,

783
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:01,321
motley crew of criminals, huh?

784
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,658
Let me introduce you first.

785
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:06,661
You met Ace,

786
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,996
master in weapons.

787
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,899
Killing comes nothing to him.

788
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:12,800
- Hey Ace,

789
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:16,537
you know the Feds, they got
these big elephant ears.

790
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,371
They're gonna hear
everything we say in here.

791
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,174
You know what I mean?

792
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,678
- No worries.

793
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,848
- Muscle.

794
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:28,149
Must I say more?

795
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:30,618
And the secret weapon,

796
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:33,588
the best part of the crew,

797
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,223
is the secret weapon:

798
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:38,226
the kid.

799
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:40,293
- What, we babysitting minors
now?

800
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:42,764
- Minor?

801
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,332
This kid has an IQ of 160.

802
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:47,802
He's smarter than all of us
combined.

803
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:51,973
To him, we're mindless apes.

804
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,141
A bunch of gorillas.

805
00:37:54,474 --> 00:37:56,577
This guy can crack any virus,

806
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,179
security system,

807
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:00,280
anything you put in front of
him.

808
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,719
And this salty, ugly South
African,

809
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:09,891
this guy right here can crack
any safe.

810
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:16,664
I know you used to be
the best 20 years ago,

811
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:20,134
but everything's digital now.

812
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,002
This guy, right?

813
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:23,037
- Hey, what's wrong with him?

814
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,905
Why is his hand shaking?

815
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,940
The guy's hand shaking.

816
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,575
- Yeah, he needs his meds.

817
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:28,576
Where is it?

818
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,410
Give it.
- The fuck is going on?

819
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,679
- He's having an event.

820
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:33,114
- Take your damn pills.

821
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,082
- The fuck is wrong with this
guy?

822
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,217
He's fucking shaking.

823
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,753
- It's probably an
epileptic fit, you know?

824
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,221
- Epileptic?
- Yeah, he has epilepsy.

825
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:42,056
He's a little schizophrenic,

826
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:43,624
but trust me,

827
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:45,726
this guy right here.
- The fuck?

828
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,395
- He's crazy like a fox.

829
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:49,964
Trust me, okay?

830
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:50,832
All right.

831
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,034
Snap out of it.

832
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,334
What the hell's wrong with you?

833
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,870
- Aren't you the motherfucker

834
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,805
that got his wife killed by the
mob?

835
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,707
- Ah.
- Fuck!

836
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,608
- Dude, dude.

837
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:03,778
Money, money.

838
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,646
Sit the fuck down right now.

839
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,317
- What the bleeding hell
is wrong with you, Yankees?

840
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,285
I mean the job hasn't even
commenced yet

841
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,155
and you are at each other's
throats.

842
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,591
I mean, it's all gone to pot,
hasn't it?

843
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:17,959
To think Ocho,

844
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:20,061
I gave up the Swedish job for
this!

845
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:21,229
- Shut the fuck up.
- No,

846
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,831
why don't you shut the fuck up?

847
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,901
- For once,

848
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:29,804
for once I agree with the Brit.

849
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:32,673
We all need to shut the fuck up.

850
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:33,541
- Hey look,

851
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,043
what's the plan?

852
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,313
- Don't worry about it.

853
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:40,380
I got it all handled.

854
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:44,852
- This guy looks like a milk
man.

855
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:47,487
- I know, I know what you up to,
man.

856
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,589
I know what you up to.

857
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:50,858
- Kid,

858
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:52,793
kid!

859
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:54,996
- I'm in the middle of a match.

860
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:56,097
- Let me tell you something.

861
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,430
I want the whole layout.

862
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,166
LaDonna's house,

863
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,368
the hotel,

864
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,202
and the place we're hitting it,

865
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,937
and I want it today.

866
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,838
You got it?

867
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:05,172
I just did that

868
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:06,007
two days ago.

869
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,474
That was fucking easy.

870
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:08,809
What'd I tell you

871
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,845
about this kid, huh?

872
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:11,846
Genius.

873
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:14,515
- Hey look, I just want
to get this job done.

874
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:19,720
We're not going in to do
anything but take one item.

875
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:22,390
A two carat, blue-white.

876
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,027
No gold, no silver.

877
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,728
You see the a hundred
dollars bills stacked up,

878
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,230
you leave them alone.

879
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,698
They're all traceable.

880
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,366
This fucking bitch is smart.

881
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,301
You got it?

882
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:35,236
You just take the blue-white.

883
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,737
That's it.

884
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,173
- Is it cut or is it uncut?

885
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:40,908
- It's beautifully cut.

886
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:43,110
Now, that's what we're looking
for.

887
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:48,015
I need you to help me find out
how many security he's got.

888
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,283
We're not gonna kill anybody.

889
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:50,551
- What?
- What we're gonna do is

890
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,053
you're gonna get some of those
darts.

891
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:52,920
Just regular darts.

892
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:55,756
We're gonna tranquilizer hers,
okay?

893
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,590
And we hit 'em with that.

894
00:40:56,624 --> 00:40:57,725
I know it sounds bad to you
guys,

895
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,459
but I'm not going to jail for
life.

896
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,861
I just got out.

897
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,129
No killing.

898
00:41:02,163 --> 00:41:03,965
We're there for the heist.

899
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:04,799
The job's over,

900
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:05,666
the worst case scenario,

901
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,668
we get hit for a little bit of
time.

902
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:09,370
You get what I'm saying?

903
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,237
All right.

904
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,041
Look,

905
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:19,547
I know you can take it like
anybody here.

906
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,381
All right?

907
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:21,649
But if you listen to me,

908
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,252
I'll fill all your bank accounts
up.

909
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:26,220
All of 'em.

910
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:31,592
You fuck with me, I'll kill you.

911
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,299
- That guy's nuts!

912
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:43,104
- Look, LaDonna killed his
wife and his unborn child.

913
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:46,974
He's the man for the job.

914
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,109
He's a genius.

915
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:49,977
A bloody genius.

916
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,846
- Yeah, he not working
with him.

917
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:12,833
- So I'm curious, Ocho,

918
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:14,969
I mean, are you considering
having children in your future?

919
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:16,771
Because the state of this car,

920
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:19,774
it's not really appropriate
for the job, is it?

921
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,976
- You chose the car.
- No, no, no, no.

922
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:23,677
I didn't.
- I chose it, okay?

923
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,146
I chose it for a reason.

924
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,180
You're gonna do a job.

925
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:27,848
You're not gonna go
around trying to show off

926
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:29,417
so the Feds can see you,

927
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,484
everybody else, the cops,

928
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,452
what is wrong with you?

929
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,721
- I'm just hoping people don't
see me.

930
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,157
- Well, I have to say,

931
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,658
I mean, compared to your
country,

932
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,093
I mean, let's face it,

933
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,295
I mean, we left you in 1776.

934
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:42,129
That's what?

935
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:43,197
300 years.

936
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,299
Whereas our current queen

937
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,201
has been on the throne for 70
years.

938
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:52,239
Just shows you that we
have style, and elegance,

939
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:53,374
and poise,

940
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,476
and what do you Americans have?

941
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,710
- How old's your queen?

942
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:57,711
- Oh, she's 95 now.

943
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,213
Shall I turn left here?

944
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,649
- So she's basically the crypt
keeper.

945
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:02,583
She should be dead.

946
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,352
- Well, I mean, you know, I,

947
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,220
she, you know what?

948
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,289
I'm absolutely flabbergasted

949
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:10,357
that you would say
something like that here.

950
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:11,459
- Hey, look.

951
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:12,561
- Look on the road!
- Hey look,

952
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:13,528
we gotta go to work, all right?

953
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,863
I'm done with this bullshit, all
right?

954
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,532
Now look, just go, just go.

955
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:20,367
- You know, I mean, we are
supposed to be working together,

956
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:22,504
and why say something?

957
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:23,370
- She's an old bat!

958
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,705
Who gives a fuck?

959
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:27,908
- Excuse me, better than Joe
Biden, yes?

960
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,210
Okay.

961
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:31,979
Now he's what?

962
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,248
85?
- Can we go to work?

963
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:36,150
You guys talk too much.

964
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:37,084
- Talk too much?

965
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,386
You put me in the front with
this?

966
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:56,003
- Is this the exact, exact one?

967
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,072
- It's very similar.

968
00:43:58,105 --> 00:43:59,173
It's a replica.
- What do you mean

969
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,074
it's similar?

970
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:01,108
- It's a replica.
- What do you mean,

971
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:01,675
a replica?

972
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:02,843
It's the same one.

973
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:03,978
It's not case hardened, the
one we're getting, right?

974
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,112
- No, not case
hardened.

975
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:05,913
- You're a hundred
percent?

976
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:06,714
- A hundred
percent.

977
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:07,948
- Why am I not involved in this?

978
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:11,886
You know, after working with
the Duchess of Marlborough

979
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:16,090
on that job in, oh 2016,

980
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:20,828
and I just can't understand
why I'm not being involved.

981
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:23,998
I mean, that is just elementary.

982
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:30,639
- Gas.

983
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,007
- Check.

984
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:35,109
- Stethoscope.

985
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,611
- Check.

986
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,145
- Drill.
- Check.

987
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,081
- Goggles.

988
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:42,816
- Check.
- I know what it is.

989
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,620
It's because I'm a Brit.

990
00:44:45,654 --> 00:44:47,922
- What the fuck are you
whimpering about over there?

991
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:48,989
Can't you see we're working?

992
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,592
- I know that.

993
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,458
- Crowbar.

994
00:44:53,127 --> 00:44:54,094
- Crowbar?

995
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:56,531
This is 2022.

996
00:44:57,965 --> 00:44:59,066
This savagery's gotta stop.

997
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,235
This primitive kind of thinking,
man,

998
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:02,469
for heaven's sake.

999
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:04,004
- I don't have time for this.
- Were you born in a jungle?

1000
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:05,306
Are you living in a tree?

1001
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,008
- I'm used to, you
know, a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

1002
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,210
- What the hell are you talking
about?

1003
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:10,311
- The digital age.
- What?

1004
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:12,379
- As I said to you, I
wanted a Lamborghini Diablo,

1005
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:13,615
a Ferrari Testarossa.

1006
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:15,684
Even the Porsche 9-11 Turbo

1007
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:17,952
does naught to 164.2 seconds.

1008
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:18,852
What do you give me?

1009
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,487
That funny wagon, clubbed out
vehicle.

1010
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:22,823
It was absolutely disgraceful!

1011
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:23,958
- Brit!

1012
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:25,527
I told you we can't have
any bling when we do a job.

1013
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,295
- And what does that mean?

1014
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,164
- This guy talks too much!

1015
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,099
Will you just shut the fuck up?

1016
00:45:32,132 --> 00:45:32,933
- That's right.

1017
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:33,901
Plug your cake hole.

1018
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:39,173
- Oh, please.

1019
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:43,043
I'm a Yankee doodle dandy.

1020
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:44,745
A Yankee doodle day!

1021
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:49,149
A Yankee doodle dandy!

1022
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,986
A Yankee doodle day.

1023
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,122
Stuart!

1024
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,024
There's an incoming!

1025
00:45:58,292 --> 00:45:59,393
On the right!

1026
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:01,696
Watch out!

1027
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:04,365
Watch out!

1028
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:09,036
I'm a Yankee doodle dandy!

1029
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:17,311
- So what's LaDonna want
us to do about this wop?

1030
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:19,146
- I don't know, but you
should keep it cool, man.

1031
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,148
You know Ladonna's wop too.

1032
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:24,051
You shouldn't be talking
like that around there.

1033
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:29,256
There he goes right there.

1034
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,358
What the hell?

1035
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:32,259
Hello?

1036
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:33,260
- They don't know
me,

1037
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:34,962
but I know you.

1038
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:37,766
Let's just say I'm a friend.

1039
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:38,600
Those two on the right,

1040
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,769
they want you back.

1041
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:50,177
- Follow him until he
come back to his car.

1042
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,900
- I don't see him anywhere, man.

1043
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,268
- LaDonna, we lost him.

1044
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:15,570
- He's stupid, so I'll
find him.

1045
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:16,738
- Come on, let's go.

1046
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:17,772
Get in.

1047
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:33,287
- Stupid fucks.

1048
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:52,473
- Where's your stupid wop
boyfriend?

1049
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:54,809
Driving around in a Cadillac
listening to Frank Sinatra

1050
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:56,578
while you're fixing to get
murdered?

1051
00:47:56,611 --> 00:47:58,613
- We're supposed to make it
messy.

1052
00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:00,180
But tell us where your wop
boyfriend is,

1053
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,949
and we'll let you keep your head
on.

1054
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,823
- She said she'd spit on our
mothers.

1055
00:48:08,857 --> 00:48:09,657
Fuck this bitch.

1056
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:11,158
Let's kill her.

1057
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,799
- Get the gun!

1058
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:21,135
Shoot him!

1059
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:22,604
- I don't know how to shoot.

1060
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:25,807
- Just shoot him!

1061
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,307
- I don't know how to shoot!

1062
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,877
- Shoot the son of a bitch!

1063
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:29,844
- I don't know how to shoot!

1064
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:31,178
I don't know how to shoot!

1065
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,248
- Pull the fucking trigger!

1066
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:39,386
Come here

1067
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,355
Gimme the gun.

1068
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:45,560
It's ok. It's ok you are doing
good

1069
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,595
Look at you, you are not even
phased.

1070
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,465
- What are you wearing?

1071
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:52,299
- Don't worry.

1072
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:53,100
I'll explain later.

1073
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,368
Don't worry about it.

1074
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,402
It's gonna be all right.

1075
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:56,370
We'll go stay at a friend's, all
right?

1076
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,204
Get your bag.

1077
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:58,907
I gotta a bag and clean this up.

1078
00:48:58,939 --> 00:48:59,741
Come on.

1079
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:01,341
Go, go, go.

1080
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:15,557
- Well, it's small.

1081
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:19,226
It's nice.

1082
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:20,762
Lock the door, please.

1083
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:21,629
Thanks.

1084
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,332
- It's a woman's place.

1085
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:27,802
I can smell the perfume.

1086
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:30,270
- It's a friend.

1087
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:33,908
- Hmm.

1088
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:40,981
- Hey, you sleeping?

1089
00:49:42,951 --> 00:49:43,885
Angie, you asleep?

1090
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:58,265
You know Angie, sometimes people
tell me,

1091
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,334
"Hey Tony, you're a good man."

1092
00:50:02,604 --> 00:50:03,805
I don't believe 'em.

1093
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:05,472
You want to know why?

1094
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:10,410
'Cause every time
someone gets close to me,

1095
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:14,516
they get hurt or in trouble.

1096
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:18,118
It's like what happened to you
today.

1097
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:21,455
I'm sorry.

1098
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:23,190
I'm sorry.

1099
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:30,464
Sophie's told me.

1100
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,533
She said,

1101
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,770
"Tony, you better find
somebody who loves you,"

1102
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:37,037
right before she died.

1103
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:41,776
You better find someone who
loves you.

1104
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:46,648
I never thought I would my whole
life.

1105
00:50:50,852 --> 00:50:51,686
Angie.

1106
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,722
Angie, baby.

1107
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,263
I got enemies all around me.

1108
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:06,668
Angie, you know your brother?

1109
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,703
I don't think he's what you
think he is.

1110
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,741
I can't put my finger on it,

1111
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:15,510
but there's something with that
guy.

1112
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:21,716
But I'm not gonna allow
anything to hurt you.

1113
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:27,956
Never again.

1114
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:47,240
- I can't believe I
just made love to Elvis.

1115
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:52,080
- I would've thought you
like Frank Sinatra better.

1116
00:51:56,149 --> 00:51:57,885
Hey, come here, kid.

1117
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:05,425
How come today you risked your
life?

1118
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,395
How come you did that?

1119
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:11,633
Risking your life and not
talking?

1120
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:14,769
- I knew that if I talked

1121
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,071
you'd probably be dead.

1122
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:20,908
And somehow I knew you'd
walk through that door.

1123
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:25,847
- You have more faith than I do.

1124
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,483
Would you do it again?

1125
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,654
- As long as my heartbeats.

1126
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,356
Hey, Tony?

1127
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:39,459
- Yes?
- I gotta tell you something.

1128
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:41,261
- Not now, let's just rest up.

1129
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:42,764
We talk seriously.

1130
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:44,098
- I have to tell you something.

1131
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:44,932
- Just do it later, baby.

1132
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:46,801
I'm so tired.

1133
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:47,635
It's all good.

1134
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,703
I got you.

1135
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:49,904
I got you.

1136
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:51,973
- Okay.
- I got you.

1137
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,519
- Food Dash, tacos.

1138
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:08,723
- I think the boys ordered
tacos.

1139
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:14,128
- Muscle, get your fucking ass
up here.

1140
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,347
- It's clear.
- Ocho,

1141
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,684
where'd the kids say the safe
was?

1142
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,152
- It's right in front of you.

1143
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:40,487
The honey pot's right there.

1144
00:53:42,824 --> 00:53:44,324
Let's get it, boys.

1145
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:48,196
- Bingo!

1146
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:49,329
- Didn't I tell you, brother?

1147
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:51,065
Didn't I tell you?

1148
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:51,966
- Fire!

1149
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:55,203
Goggles.

1150
00:53:57,038 --> 00:53:57,839
- Come on, come on.

1151
00:53:57,872 --> 00:53:58,673
We don't have time.

1152
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:00,541
Come on, come on!

1153
00:54:09,517 --> 00:54:10,350
- Action!

1154
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:11,552
Spark!

1155
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,988
- For five more K I could
have got that lock safe open.

1156
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,757
- Incidentally,

1157
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:20,027
how I wonder are we were
able to track them on camera?

1158
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,764
- I changed the camera a week
ago.

1159
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:25,499
The security system sucks.

1160
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:31,539
- Man of my experience
and superior intellect

1161
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,246
in a car with a 20 year
old playing on a computer.

1162
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:41,516
- I did a background check
on you three days ago.

1163
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:44,051
I hacked into the MI6 records.

1164
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:47,522
The only bond you've got is a
bail bond.

1165
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:49,422
- What's taking so long?

1166
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:53,995
Open it!

1167
00:54:54,028 --> 00:54:56,164
Open it, open it, open it!

1168
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,072
Keep it going.
Keep it going.

1169
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:06,406
- Don't make it too hot.

1170
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:07,542
Don't heat it up too much.

1171
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:09,110
Don't heat it up too much!

1172
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:10,011
- Come on, come on!

1173
00:55:10,044 --> 00:55:11,612
- Don't make it too hard.

1174
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,214
Gotta be careful.

1175
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:14,982
- Get it work!

1176
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:19,787
- Don't do too much.

1177
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:21,589
'Til the color changes.

1178
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:29,329
- Drill!

1179
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,838
- Be careful, be careful.

1180
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:41,909
Oh my god.

1181
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,255
- It's fucking case hardened!

1182
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:58,491
It's case hardened!

1183
00:55:58,526 --> 00:56:00,328
- Let me try this.
- It's case hardened!

1184
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,596
You gave me the intel!

1185
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:03,130
It's case hardened!

1186
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:04,332
Give me the stethoscope.

1187
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:05,867
- Trying to drop the tumblers.

1188
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:08,269
- You fucking kidding me?

1189
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:09,937
Oh, man!

1190
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:11,906
Come on, come on!

1191
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:13,274
- Okay, quiet.

1192
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:14,942
Tell me when to drop.

1193
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:15,977
Tell me to drop.

1194
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:16,944
- The heck,

1195
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:17,845
you think I came in
with the last rank drop?

1196
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:19,446
I know what the fuck to do!

1197
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:20,281
- Hey, listen.

1198
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:21,349
In my attention, man,

1199
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,552
we respected people who
are in the business, okay?

1200
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:27,420
Shit

1201
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:28,455
- I need a code.

1202
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,790
I need a code!

1203
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:31,025
Dammit!

1204
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,226
- I got the code.
- Give me the code!

1205
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,461
He's got the code!
- Give me your phone!

1206
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:35,763
Give me your fucking phone!

1207
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:37,098
- You gotta give him five more
grand.

1208
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:38,232
- Five more grand?
- Give it to him!

1209
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:39,200
- Give it to him, man.

1210
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,907
- I changed the digital locks.

1211
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:51,879
- Give him the code!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1212
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:55,349
- Four sevens.
- Okay.

1213
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:01,122
- I told you, man.

1214
00:57:01,155 --> 00:57:01,923
You gave it too much heat.

1215
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:03,224
- I didn't burn anything up!

1216
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:04,725
That was perfect heat!

1217
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:05,860
Give me the crowbar!

1218
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:06,861
The kid was right.

1219
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:07,695
I heard it drop.

1220
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:08,562
The lock dropped.

1221
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:09,864
I just need to pry it open.

1222
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:10,765
The code was right.

1223
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:13,701
Give me the crowbar!
- All right, man!

1224
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:14,802
What do you wanna do, this
primitive?

1225
00:57:14,835 --> 00:57:15,703
- Get off!

1226
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,238
The crowbar!

1227
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:18,539
- You're barbaric!

1228
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:20,908
I can open it with my mind!

1229
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:21,709
- Get off!

1230
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:23,811
Get your fucking hands off!

1231
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:25,880
Ah, shit!

1232
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:26,714
You stupid, old man!

1233
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,616
- My god!
- Fucking crazy bastard!

1234
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:32,219
- Wait, wait.
- Shit!

1235
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,054
- I can do it.

1236
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:33,988
I can do it with my mind!

1237
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:35,856
- Move your fucking hand!

1238
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,191
- Now wait a
minute.

1239
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:38,025
I can get it.

1240
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,393
- Get it, get it!

1241
00:57:39,427 --> 00:57:40,227
- Open, open, open!

1242
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:41,095
Open it!

1243
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:45,299
Turn it off!

1244
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,335
Turn it off old man!

1245
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,907
- Show me, show me, show me.

1246
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,941
Oh Yea

1247
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,944
- Authenticate.
-Authenticate.

1248
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,147
- Let's see.

1249
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:01,015
Shit, let me look.

1250
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:02,116
Here it goes.

1251
00:58:03,818 --> 00:58:05,619
See?
- All right.

1252
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:07,088
Is it real?

1253
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:08,756
- This ain't no jalapeno pepper.

1254
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,324
- Shut the fuck up.
- Is it real?

1255
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:11,559
- Hold on, let me look.

1256
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:16,630
Oh man, yeah.

1257
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:17,732
- Is it real?

1258
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,133
- It's a blue-white.

1259
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,001
- Yeah!

1260
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:23,037
We're fucking rich.

1261
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:23,838
- Looks like a blue-white.

1262
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,672
- Serious?

1263
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:26,507
- Blue-white, baby!

1264
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,875
- Yes, yes, yes!

1265
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:31,612
We're rich!
- Give it to me.

1266
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:32,713
- Move it, move it!

1267
00:58:32,747 --> 00:58:34,815
Give it to him.

1268
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,951
- Get his medicine, man!

1269
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:39,353
- Did one job!
- The fuck is wrong with you?

1270
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:40,488
- Fuck!
- Give his fucking pills

1271
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,089
to him!
- Shit!

1272
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:46,227
- Pills!

1273
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,028
Hold his tongue!

1274
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:48,229
Hold his tongue out!
- What?

1275
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:49,930
- Pull his tongue out!

1276
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,167
He fucking bit me!

1277
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,638
Calm down.

1278
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:59,807
Calm down, it's okay.

1279
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,641
Calm down.

1280
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:01,510
Calm down.

1281
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:08,682
Calm down, calm down, calm down!

1282
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:13,721
Calm down!

1283
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,090
He's good.

1284
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:23,864
- Can I keep it?

1285
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,011
- Quiet.

1286
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:38,646
Don't wake up the damn roosters.

1287
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:43,984
Hey, what are you doing?

1288
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:47,154
I told you not to fucking take
the cash!

1289
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:47,988
What is wrong with you?

1290
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:48,856
They'll trace us.

1291
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:53,528
- Mario, go wait by the car.

1292
00:59:53,562 --> 00:59:55,062
Go!
- Should I go this way,

1293
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,030
or that way?

1294
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:57,665
- Get the fuck out of here.

1295
00:59:57,698 --> 00:59:59,633
This guy's fucking crazy.

1296
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:01,869
- All right, put your
fucking hands up, man.

1297
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:04,972
- You wanna put that gun down

1298
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,174
unless you want do 300 years.

1299
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,175
- What are you talking about?

1300
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:10,010
- Shooting a government
official.

1301
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,612
- You're a cop?

1302
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:13,347
- Actually, old man,

1303
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,049
maybe your eyes are getting bad.

1304
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:20,221
You know the difference
between CIA agent and a cop?

1305
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:21,689
Give me that gun.

1306
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:23,592
- What about the tattoos?

1307
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:26,627
- The CIA has the best makeup
artists.

1308
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,664
Actually, I think it kind
of suits me, doesn't it?

1309
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,167
Where's the diamond?

1310
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,101
- I swallowed it.

1311
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:35,236
I felt the setup,

1312
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:36,704
but I didn't know you were cops!

1313
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:38,739
- You fucking swallowed it?

1314
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:40,074
You fucking swallowed it?

1315
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:42,109
- Get the fuck inside, man.

1316
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:44,345
- But now you're gonna go to a
room

1317
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:46,080
where you're gonna extract that
diamond

1318
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:46,881
your damn self.

1319
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:49,416
Better have it by the morning.

1320
01:00:55,524 --> 01:00:57,791
- Well, hello, Mr. D'Angelo.

1321
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:59,426
Have a seat.

1322
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,794
I trust you slept well?

1323
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:04,231
I trust even more,

1324
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:06,133
more importantly,

1325
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:09,436
I trust you extracted the
diamond.

1326
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,138
- Yeah, I shit the diamond.

1327
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,307
He's got it in the plastic bag.

1328
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:16,944
- Very good.

1329
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,647
Well, let's cut to the chase.

1330
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:22,216
You are a great safecracker.

1331
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:26,020
We could use someone like
you here in the agency.

1332
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:28,355
- You already did use me.

1333
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:32,527
Where's the big mouth Brit and
the kid?

1334
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,862
- The Brit and the kid have
been reassigned already

1335
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:35,796
up north,

1336
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:39,500
but that's no concern of yours.

1337
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:40,602
The main thing,

1338
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:42,870
the reason why we brought you
here,

1339
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:46,240
is right here in this folder.

1340
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:48,909
Everything you need to know.

1341
01:01:48,943 --> 01:01:53,948
As a matter of fact,
we have a common enemy,

1342
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:56,317
a common threat,

1343
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,484
LaDonna.

1344
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:01,088
She's not a small
potatoes criminal anymore.

1345
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:06,126
She's risen to be
someone of great concern.

1346
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:10,699
She now does dealings with both
the Chinese and the Russians

1347
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:12,833
selling important intel

1348
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:15,670
that could topple the whole east
coast

1349
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:20,808
and cause danger to the great
United States of America.

1350
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:23,410
We need to take her out.

1351
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:25,547
- Angie, huh?

1352
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,616
- Officer Sanchez.

1353
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:30,251
Nice to meet you, Mr. D'Angelo.

1354
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:33,053
- I can't shoot.

1355
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,090
What an actress.

1356
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:38,292
- First thing that is taught to
us

1357
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:40,729
when coming aboard the agency

1358
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:43,063
is how to be a good actor.

1359
01:02:43,364 --> 01:02:47,201
And Ms. Sanchez, you
served your country well.

1360
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:49,236
- Yeah, you took one for
the team, didn't you?

1361
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,071
You're a team player.

1362
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:54,241
- Wait, Jimmy.

1363
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,110
It's okay.

1364
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:01,683
Mr. D'Angelo has been in
a lot of stress lately.

1365
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:05,786
A lot of stuff has happened
within the last 24 hours.

1366
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,388
- Let's get this straight.

1367
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:09,624
I spent 20 years in jail.

1368
01:03:09,658 --> 01:03:10,858
I get out.

1369
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:12,727
You guys set me up for a
robbery.

1370
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:16,497
You use your agents and
that whack job over there,

1371
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,931
and then you arrest me.

1372
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,166
What the hell's this about?

1373
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:20,334
- If he insults me one more
time,

1374
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,836
I'll punch his little teeth in.

1375
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,806
- Officer Stern, that's
not the way we operate.

1376
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,241
We need to treat this individual

1377
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:29,877
under the rights under section
AN7.

1378
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:32,980
- You know about the
Russians of the Chinese.

1379
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:35,883
She's been smuggling kids,

1380
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,384
giving intel,

1381
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:38,886
gaining intel,

1382
01:03:38,919 --> 01:03:41,055
then selling it back to them.

1383
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:45,426
LaDonna is slated to meet
with a high powered official

1384
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:46,860
in China.

1385
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:50,799
She was gonna use that little
diamond as a bargaining chip

1386
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,767
to gain their trust.

1387
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,101
- What about the darts?

1388
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,170
They're waking up by now.

1389
01:03:56,203 --> 01:03:57,237
They'll tell her I was there.

1390
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:58,305
I did everything.

1391
01:03:58,339 --> 01:04:01,975
- Those guards that you
thought were knocked out.

1392
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,177
They're dead.

1393
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,747
We have a guy on the inside.

1394
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,848
One of her guards, right?

1395
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:08,916
There will be a gun.

1396
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:11,686
Right side,

1397
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,054
third seat from LaDonna.

1398
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:17,525
We're here to make,

1399
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,927
what would you gangsters call
it?

1400
01:04:21,128 --> 01:04:23,130
An offer you can't.

1401
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:24,833
- Fuck you very much.

1402
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:25,734
No, thank you.

1403
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,069
- Fuck you very much.

1404
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:34,642
Well, it's very humid here in
Florida.

1405
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:37,746
Wouldn't you say so, Officer
Sanchez?

1406
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,279
Really hot and humid.

1407
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:45,653
I would say it's probably the
worst place

1408
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:48,155
to have to serve 30 years.

1409
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:03,638
- Yeah?

1410
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:04,572
Of course I'm here.

1411
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:06,006
What the fuck you think?

1412
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,108
What time you getting here?

1413
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:09,309
Hurry the hell up.

1414
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:15,817
Sir?
- You guys need me,

1415
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:16,917
gimme a call.

1416
01:05:18,586 --> 01:05:22,423
- Is he clean?

1417
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:24,592
- He's clean.

1418
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:26,326
- Sit down.

1419
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:33,133
- LaDonna.

1420
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:35,837
Respect.

1421
01:05:36,805 --> 01:05:38,972
Ah, taste the wine.

1422
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:41,843
Uncle Augustino Iadellie's eh?

1423
01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:47,682
I needed that.

1424
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:48,550
Grazie.

1425
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,218
- Tony,

1426
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,587
as kids, you always had a way

1427
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,087
of talking your way out of
things.

1428
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:55,989
I remember when my husband had
control

1429
01:05:56,023 --> 01:05:57,357
of the lower east side,

1430
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:58,593
you got in trouble with the cops

1431
01:05:58,626 --> 01:05:59,928
and talked your way out of it.

1432
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,995
Everyone admired your silky
voice.

1433
01:06:02,897 --> 01:06:03,731
- Salut.

1434
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:05,667
Grazie.

1435
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,835
- All right, Tony,

1436
01:06:06,868 --> 01:06:08,469
you know I'm not here to suck
any dick.

1437
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:10,237
Let's get down to the skinny of
it.

1438
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,373
Listen here, Tony.

1439
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:16,076
I knew your father and
I knew your brother.

1440
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:19,046
What happened to Sophie
was just fucking business.

1441
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,615
Nothing personal.

1442
01:06:20,648 --> 01:06:24,351
My husband was taken down
like a pig in Times Square,

1443
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:26,086
but that's the past.

1444
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:28,957
Tony, Tony.

1445
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:30,457
I got big since you got in.

1446
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:34,094
I got bigger than the Don ever
dreamed of.

1447
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:37,030
I got ambassadors eating
out of this pussy.

1448
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:39,333
Worldwide shit, Tony.

1449
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:41,401
Tony, I got the world by a

1450
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:44,137
All these dirty, old men,

1451
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,907
all they need is a third world
bitch

1452
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,609
and some panties.

1453
01:06:47,642 --> 01:06:49,944
Got 'em bouncing like puppets.

1454
01:06:49,978 --> 01:06:53,113
And you know we got all
those old men on video

1455
01:06:53,146 --> 01:06:54,682
with all those young bitches.

1456
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:58,118
Tony, that's billions, not
millions.

1457
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:00,755
We could rule the world.

1458
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:02,824
Come with me, forget the past.

1459
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:04,993
You're gonna be family.

1460
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:07,629
I'll pay you like never before.

1461
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:08,997
No more hate.

1462
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,163
No more games.

1463
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:11,833
Just counting money.

1464
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:12,700
- LaDonna,

1465
01:07:13,568 --> 01:07:14,936
I don't know,

1466
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,136
fellows, I don't know how she's
done this.

1467
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:18,673
I mean, you know she's always
been smarter than the Don,

1468
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:19,541
right?

1469
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:20,542
I mean Mac, you know what I'm
saying?

1470
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:22,109
Hey, I knew your father, by the
way.

1471
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:24,044
He was a Wesite, right?

1472
01:07:24,077 --> 01:07:26,146
Yeah, he used to work for my
father.

1473
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:27,147
A good man.

1474
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,016
Rest his soul.

1475
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:32,386
- Tony, my safe was robbed last
night.

1476
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:34,556
Couple of my boys got it.

1477
01:07:35,957 --> 01:07:37,792
Tony, was it you?

1478
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:39,894
Give me one good reason

1479
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:42,530
I should believe this sit
down isn't just bullshit.

1480
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:47,134
Michael will kill you
right here right now,

1481
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:48,402
and you know it.

1482
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:52,372
You've got one minute to
convince me, motherfucker.

1483
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:53,206
- LaDonna,

1484
01:07:54,107 --> 01:07:55,442
what happened last night,

1485
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:58,078
I didn't cause it.

1486
01:07:58,111 --> 01:08:00,213
I hired outside guys.

1487
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:01,381
They lied to me.

1488
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:04,018
They said the darts are
tranquilizers.

1489
01:08:04,052 --> 01:08:05,920
They lied and they killed them.

1490
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:07,055
It was not me.

1491
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:08,255
The only thing I was doing there

1492
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:10,123
is trying to get this diamond

1493
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:13,027
so I could give it back to
you to show you respect,

1494
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,063
to show your peace offering.

1495
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:17,065
That's all I was doing.

1496
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:20,233
I just wanted to give you
this as a peace offering.

1497
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:26,507
- You slick son of a bitch.

1498
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,474
You got my diamond

1499
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:30,078
and gave it back to pay your
loyalty?

1500
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,013
I knew it was you, Tony.

1501
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:33,915
- So you took out my cousin?

1502
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:36,050
- What the fuck are you talking
about?

1503
01:08:36,084 --> 01:08:38,385
The fucking guy raped your
sister.

1504
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:39,921
You were gonna fucking kill him
anyway.

1505
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:42,090
Stop the bullshit!

1506
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:45,593
The chinks are gonna
give me the White House.

1507
01:08:45,627 --> 01:08:47,762
You know, the chinks own the
White House.

1508
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:52,466
- LaDonna, you know I've been
inside.

1509
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:54,936
I've been in hell for 20 years.

1510
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:56,904
And what I learned inside there

1511
01:08:58,973 --> 01:09:00,374
was that things,

1512
01:09:01,241 --> 01:09:02,710
they stopped making sense.

1513
01:09:02,744 --> 01:09:04,979
You understand what I'm saying?

1514
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:07,214
And I knew when I was in there,

1515
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:09,984
I realized that when Sophie
died,

1516
01:09:10,018 --> 01:09:10,985
part of me died,

1517
01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:14,388
and I knew when the Don
died part of you died.

1518
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:15,455
Am I right?

1519
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,393
Now look what happened.

1520
01:09:19,426 --> 01:09:21,029
We both lost,

1521
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:23,564
but now we have a chance,

1522
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:25,967
and there's only one thing we
can do.

1523
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,038
'Cause you see we're either
gonna die in the street

1524
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:31,673
like pigs,

1525
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:33,841
or we're gonna make a
lot of money together.

1526
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,175
Like billions, like you said.

1527
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:38,646
You know, you're like me,

1528
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,580
you don't give up,

1529
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:41,783
and I don't give up.

1530
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,316
So we have to make a choice.

1531
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:45,953
I mean, we're the same animal.

1532
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:46,788
You know what I mean?

1533
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:48,255
I mean, you're an animal,
LaDonna.

1534
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:49,123
- Stop.

1535
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,627
Anthony's actually making sense
right now.

1536
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,795
Go on.

1537
01:09:53,828 --> 01:09:57,431
- You're one of the smartest
people I know, all right?

1538
01:09:57,464 --> 01:09:58,666
You didn't come back to New York

1539
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,801
'till you was 20 years old,

1540
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,836
but they knew you was the brains

1541
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,304
that was gonna operate this
thing.

1542
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:05,139
LaDonna,

1543
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:08,509
when I was on the inside, like I
said,

1544
01:10:08,543 --> 01:10:11,112
you know, things stopped making
sense.

1545
01:10:11,145 --> 01:10:13,514
I knew that we only had one
choice,

1546
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:18,519
and that choice is to choose
survival.

1547
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,154
We have to survive.

1548
01:10:21,455 --> 01:10:22,790
I wanna live like you do.

1549
01:10:22,824 --> 01:10:24,357
I wanna live like a king,

1550
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,460
and I know you wanna live like a
queen.

1551
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:28,029
So we unite,

1552
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:30,230
we stop this war.

1553
01:10:30,263 --> 01:10:31,699
We come together.

1554
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:35,268
We make a lot of money.

1555
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:36,604
We survive.

1556
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:38,039
- Sounds good, Tony.

1557
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:39,707
It all sounds good.

1558
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:41,142
I'll forget the Don.

1559
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:42,275
You forget Sophia.

1560
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:44,311
- No!

1561
01:10:45,213 --> 01:10:46,047
- No?

1562
01:10:47,048 --> 01:10:48,415
What do you mean, "No?"

1563
01:10:50,051 --> 01:10:51,786
- What I was trying to say to
you

1564
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:56,057
was on the inside I learned

1565
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,059
that things stopped making
sense.

1566
01:10:58,893 --> 01:11:00,762
For example, you know these
young girls

1567
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:04,532
that you exposed to these old
men,

1568
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:07,001
you made a lot of money, right?

1569
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:10,505
And you made yourself very
powerful, did you not?

1570
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,978
I, LaDonna,

1571
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:19,614
I just lied to you.

1572
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:32,627
- She's dead.

1573
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,861
- Give me a gun!

1574
01:11:33,895 --> 01:11:36,429
- She's dead.
- Give me a gun!

1575
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:39,267
This is for Sophie and the young
girls.

1576
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:43,104
- She's dead, Tony.
