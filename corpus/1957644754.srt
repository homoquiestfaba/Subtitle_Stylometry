00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:37,710
(SINGING) I'm gonna
kiss you all over, baby.

4
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,299
I'm gonna take you there.

5
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:52,100
So take it slow and easy.

6
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:56,722
Gonna take our time tonight.

7
00:00:56,826 --> 00:01:00,615
I'm gonna fill you
up with my lovin'.

8
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,740
I'm gonna take you there.

9
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:13,232
I'm gonna kiss you
all over, baby.

10
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,117
I'm gonna kiss you.

11
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm gonna kiss you all over.

12
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:24,181
I'm gonna kiss you
all over, baby.

13
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,691
I'm gonna take you there.

14
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,679
I'm gonna kiss you all over.

15
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:35,545
I'm gonna kiss you
all over, baby.

16
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,327
I'm gonna take you there.

17
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,003
I'm gonna kiss you all over.

18
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:46,321
I'm gonna kiss you
all over, baby.

19
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:49,275
I'm gonna kiss you.

20
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,369
I'm gonna kiss you all over.

21
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:57,686
I'm gonna kiss you
all over, baby.

22
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,362
I'm gonna take you there.

24
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,057
CONNIE: Miami-- what can
I tell you about Miami?

25
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,810
Well, this is what's really
happening these days.

26
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:21,286
The good news, big
money keeps flowing in.

27
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,711
The bad news?

28
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:25,423
Too many sharks smelling
an easy killing.

29
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:29,176
So I say, be smarter
than the other guy.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,600
Do your homework.

31
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:31,991
Know your mark.

32
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:34,667
I mean, really know your mark.

33
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,857
For instance, I read
in the business section

34
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,395
this morning that
someone called Goldman

35
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:41,792
just quit some big ad agency.

36
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:45,512
So I do a little checking
here, a little checking there,

37
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:48,397
and I'm ready to do business.

38
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,830
Connie Coolidge to
see Mr. Goldman.

39
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,394
I have an appointment.

40
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:55,035
Well, please take a seat
and I'll have someone see you.

41
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,391
MAN: I don't know to tell you.

42
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:00,423
Goldman was let go
Friday afternoon.

43
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:02,716
Took me out to camp with him.

44
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,767
I think he's going independent.

45
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,609
MARSHA: This is a shock.

46
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:09,772
I even gave notice
at my other job.

47
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:12,345
You see, I flew in from Chicago.

48
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,473
Well, I have his home number
if you'd like to make a call.

49
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:18,600
Well, I do have
a slight problem.

50
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:23,467
Mr. Goldman promised he would
cover any of my expenses,

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,733
and I had to lay out
$600 for my plane ticket.

52
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,018
MARSHA (VOICEOVER):
Short and sweet.

53
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:42,930
Never say more than you have to.

54
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,495
Never stay longer than you need.

55
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,160
600?

56
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:51,793
Why did I say Chicago?

57
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,713
I should have said
LA and asked for 800.

58
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,589
Anyway, it's not
a bad day's work,

59
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,224
and it's not even lunchtime.

60
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,526
SALESPERSON: Ma'am,
it's our policy.

61
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:11,883
I'm sorry, but I
really can't do that.

62
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,663
WOMAN: Just charge it to
my room like I told you.

63
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,826
You're just too lazy
to do the paperwork.

64
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,675
235, do you have that?

65
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:24,430
And tell your boss to call
me when he comes back.

66
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,855
Gift wrapped.

67
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:33,536

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,422
MARSHA: I'll have
the lobster thermidor

69
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,055
and a glass of champagne.

70
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,236
French, if you have it.

71
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,279
WAITER: Thank you, ma'am.

72
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,435
Are you staying at the hotel?

73
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:44,763
Yes, room 235.

74
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,779
You can charge it.

75
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:49,073
Oh, and have a bottle of
champagne sent to the sales

76
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:50,567
girl at the boutique.

77
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:53,418
I think she'd like Dom
Perignon-- with a note.

78
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:57,345
Apologies for my
behavior, room 235.

79
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,839
You can charge that too.

80
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:00,820
WAITER: Very good.

83
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,154
Hello?

84
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,544
HENRY (ON PHONE): Marsha,
it's your friend, Henry.

85
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:11,178
What do you want,
old friend Henry?

86
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:14,723
How'd you like to make another
payment on your brother's debt?

87
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:16,079
MARSHA (ON PHONE):
How much, Henry?

88
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,060
500 for five minutes.

89
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,389
Sounds like a
pretty good rate.

90
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,196
Who do I have to shoot?

91
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,073
Oh Marsha, Marsha.

92
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:25,567
You know me.

93
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,923
I mean, your brother Frankie'd
still be in the slammer

94
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:31,615
if it wasn't for my
expertise as his counsel.

95
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,561
Yeah, I know, my brother
won't even speak to me,

96
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,960
and I'm still paying
for your expertise.

97
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:39,783
Well, it's time for you to
make another payment, sweetie.

98
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:40,896
OK.
All right.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,834
What's the poop?

100
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:43,120
The poop?

101
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,684
Well, the poop is
put on something sexy

102
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:49,689
and go to the car wash on
third tomorrow morning at 10.

103
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,879
There's a fancy
red sports car that

104
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:56,710
comes in every Tuesday for the
VIP treatment, only this time,

105
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,004
it's going bye bye to
South America-- that

106
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,985
is, as soon as you
can engage the owner

107
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,738
in a distracting conversation.

108
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:08,459

00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:18,225
Nice car.

111
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,901
Is it yours?

112
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,013
Yeah.

113
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:22,986
It's gorgeous.

114
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,034
Thanks.

115
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,710
Uh, do you have any change?

116
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,274
There's a machine in there.

117
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,838
It sells those little
tree air fresheners,

118
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:36,541
but it only takes dollar bills.

119
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,341
I don't.

120
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,426
I don't have any change.

121
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,538
I'll get some coffee.

122
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:41,651
They'll break it for me.

123
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,521
Do you want some?

124
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:52,461
Yeah.

125
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:58,855
Two regular coffees, please.

126
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,420
No, I'll have a cappuccino.

127
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,768
Thank you.

128
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:16,408
Thank you.

129
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,127
Cheers.

00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,287
I'm Cassandra.

00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,434
Matt.

132
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,976
So, Matt, you can't
be from around here.

133
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,061
Actually, I grew
up in South Beach.

134
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,104
Oh, yeah?

135
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,981
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,684
Graduated from the
University of Miami.

137
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,766
What do you do?

138
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:50,018
I get my car washed.

139
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:54,363
I do a little bicycling,
a little, uh, windsurfing.

140
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,648
Sounds like a good job to me.

141
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,387
Where do I apply?

142
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:59,368
I love windsurfing.

143
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:00,827
WOMAN (ON PA):
Attention, please.

144
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:02,878
The owner of the
white Mercedes 500,

145
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,102
your car is ready for pickup.

146
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,107
Matt Conrad?

147
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:12,401
Matt Conrad?

148
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:15,147
You're not the "Headless
Johnson's Revenge" Matt Conrad,

149
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:16,780
are you?

150
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:17,823
Yeah.

151
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:21,959
My eight-year-old
loves those games.

152
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:22,932
Thanks.

153
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,497
Tell him he's
gotta file a claim

154
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:25,991
with his insurance company.

155
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:28,146
They're not gonna do squat
unless he reports it.

156
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,502
Hey, why don't
you file a report

157
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:30,926
with your insurance company?

158
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:32,387
Lady, you got some nerve.

159
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,020
I'm not the one that was
preoccupied with my hormones

160
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:35,098
and left my car unattended.

161
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:38,156
Hey, there's no
need to be rude.

162
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:41,701
Step over this
way, please, sir.

163
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,196
Sir, I'd like to check
the documentation

164
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,282
on some of your workers.

165
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:47,089
I'm impressed.

166
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,939
The Matt Conrad.

167
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,858
What, it takes a
Lamborghini to impress you?

168
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,770
No, what impresses
me is a guy who's

169
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,785
able to start up a
multimillion dollar

170
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,332
business out of his garage.

171
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:03,112
I was just doing what I love.

172
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,050
Somebody wanted it.

173
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:07,178
I got lucky.

174
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,098
Makes two of us.

175
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:13,817
You have beautiful
eyes, you know that?

176
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,493
You say that to everyone.

177
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,162
No, I-- I don't.

178
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:25,357
Well, this is it.

179
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:26,885
Would you like to
come in for a drink?

180
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,824
I'd love to.

181
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,387
Wow.

182
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:46,767
My entire apartment could
fit in your living room.

183
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:49,825
Yeah, well.

184
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,702
So all this is yours?

185
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:52,779
Not quite.

186
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,578
Company owns it.

187
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,491
And you own the company?

188
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,687
No, they just kind
of need me right now,

189
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:02,650
so they figured
this'd keep me happy.

190
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:04,665
And are you?

191
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,578
Sometimes.

192
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:10,609
The shareholders say that
if I'm happy, they're happy.

193
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:11,617
So.

194
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:12,556
How about you?

195
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,780
Are you happy?

196
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,310
Uh, sometimes.

197
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,114
Pool, my favorite game.

198
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:24,269
Do you wanna play a game?

199
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,208
Yeah, I'd love to.

200
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:26,772
I'm not very good, though.

201
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,136
Oh, come on, rack the balls.

202
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,491
I'll show you how to play.

203
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,832
[inaudible]

204
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,258
You gonna break?

205
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,405
I'm going to break.

206
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,193
Now, pay attention.

207
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:57,671
Two balls.

208
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,165
Very impressive.

209
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:04,136
Excuse me.

210
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,186
It's quite all right.

211
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,124
I don't mind at all.

212
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,328
All right, you're
breaking my concentration.

213
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:16,475
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:19,186
The excuses are
starting already.

215
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,402
MATT: All right, go ahead.

216
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,385
You're breaking
my concentration.

217
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,061
Oh, isn't that awful?

218
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:34,999
It's my shot.

219
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,777
That's all you get.

220
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,672
[moaning]

221
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:18,749
Well, Smokey, gotta
go to work now.

222
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,279
I had a good time.

223
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,947
I just want you to know
I don't make a habit

224
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,059
of this kind of behavior.

225
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:32,929
So I guess you say
goodbye to number 52

226
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:37,414
and put another notch
in the old bedpost.

227
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,673
Well, actually, um,
the bed's antique,

228
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:44,087
So I keep track of my
conquests on my computer.

229
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,242
I'd like to read it sometime.

230
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,667
Mm-hm.

231
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:51,559
Sorry, I'm just afraid that--

232
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,985
That what?

233
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,105
That I go out with women once
and then I throw them away?

234
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,079
Well?

235
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,501
I like you.

236
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,828
Does that mean
I'll see you again?

237
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:04,802
Maybe.

238
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,382
Give me your phone number.

239
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,894
Top one's a cellular.
Bottom one's home.

240
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:24,961
Hm.

241
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,244
You know, you even
look good in my sweats.

242
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:34,589
You're gonna have to see me
again if you want 'em back.

243
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:35,527
I'm gonna want them back.

244
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:41,783
Bye.

245
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:42,722
See ya.

246
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,656
What do you say, slim?

247
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,800
Nice outfit.

248
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,226
What do you want, Henry?

249
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,797
How's your brother Frankie?

250
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,578
Last time I saw him was
when I put him on the bus.

251
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:14,316
He hasn't called,
and I can't find him.

252
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:15,706
I dunno.

253
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:17,618
I think maybe his pride's
getting in the way.

254
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:19,113
Call it "guilt."

255
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:22,520
And your brother isn't showing
much gratitude, letting

256
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,396
baby sister pay his bill.

257
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,370
He's my brother.

258
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:28,080
He helped me out
when I was a kid.

259
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,644
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:33,815
Well, how'd you like to pay
Frankie's debt in one shot.

261
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,822
Who do I have to kill?

262
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:35,761
Don't say that.

263
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:36,977
It hurts my ear.

264
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:37,742
No, no.

265
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,723
You've got other talents.

266
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:40,870
You're an artist.

267
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,926
We got this girl who works temp.

268
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,123
And right now she's
working at Steven Hayes,

269
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:54,496
transferring files onto
hard discs, floppy discs,

270
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,337
and putting it all
on one computer.

271
00:15:56,442 --> 00:16:00,370
Anyhow, she's coming up
with some pretty hot stuff.

272
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,489
Well, we got this one old
broad, she's about ready

273
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,122
to drop at any minute.

274
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:08,503
She's, uh, been living off of
the interest and the dividends

275
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:13,334
of a trust fund that her brother
set up for her before he died.

276
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:16,010
Anyhow, once she keels
over, the entire bundle

277
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:18,930
goes to this girl, Jean.

278
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,320
She doesn't know who Jean is.

279
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:21,918
She doesn't wanna know.

280
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:26,263
But Jean is the illegitimate
daughter of her dead brother,

281
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:29,877
and is destined
to become the, uh,

282
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:34,778
sole surviving blood
relative of the dynasty.

283
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,585
Capish?

284
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,525
Yeah.

285
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:38,775
Go on.

286
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,765
Well, Jean never
knew her father.

287
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:46,387
She doesn't even know she's
coming into all this scratch.

288
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:48,681
She's just out there.

289
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:52,227
You're gonna become
her new best friend,

290
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:55,146
and you're gonna get to
know every intimate detail

291
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:56,745
about her.

292
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,282
And when the old
lady dies, boom.

293
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:02,896
Out goes the old Jean,
in comes the new Jean.

294
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:07,971
And the new Jean suddenly finds
out that she's very, very rich.

295
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:09,258
Boom, Henry?

296
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,683
You know I don't do boom.
- Oh, come on.

297
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,491
You know, this is gonna
be nice and clean.

298
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,749
We're gonna take
good care of her.

299
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:18,885
We're gonna send her on a
nice, long trip to Fiji.

300
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:23,369
By the time she comes back,
the biscuits are done.

301
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:28,687
I mean, even if she finds
out, it's gonna be too late.

302
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,147
I dunno.
You have it--

303
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,433
Come on, Marsha.

304
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:33,379
I'm giving you the
chance of a lifetime.

305
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:37,827
All I'm asking you is to
inherit a few million.

306
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:47,108
20%, and your brother's debt is
off the books once and for all.

307
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:49,679
OK, nothing
happens to the girl.

308
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,279
My brother's debt is history.

309
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:52,599
I get 30%.

310
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:53,642
Oh, Marsha.

311
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:54,719
Come on, don't do this to me.

312
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:03,721
OK, OK, OK.

313
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:06,502
Here I got some scratch, 3,000.

314
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:10,013
Expenses, get
yourself a used car.

315
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:10,951
Pay cash.

316
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,967
Come on.

317
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,087
I want a receipt.

318
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:18,945
This isn't like you, actually
putting out money for a job.

319
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,802
Well, you gotta
speculate to accumulate.

320
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:25,548
I got you an apartment right
across the hallway from hers.

321
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:09,551
Hello, Jean Ivers.

322
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:18,970
[knocking]

323
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:19,909
JEAN: Yeah.

324
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:24,497
Hi.

325
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,096
I'm sorry to bother you.

326
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,771
I just moved into apartment
15, and I was wondering if you

327
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,691
had some decaf I could borrow.

328
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,978
Uh, sure.

329
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:33,951
Wait there.

330
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:34,889
Thanks.

331
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,228
Ah, thanks.

332
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:48,515
You're a lifesaver.

333
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:50,043
I'm Maddie.

334
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:50,842
Oh, Jean.

335
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,025
Welcome to Sunnyside.

336
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:54,457
It seems like a fun place.

337
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,508
Hey, well, thanks
for the coffee.

338
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,663
I'll get you some
more in the morning.

339
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,018
- No rush.
- Thanks.

340
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:00,991
Bye-bye.

341
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:08,812
[phone ringing]

342
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:12,427
Hello.

343
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:13,366
MARSHA (ON PHONE): Hey, Stein.

344
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,650
Can I see you?

345
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,736
Not, "hello Mr. Stein.

346
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,197
How are you?"

347
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,081
All right, Mr. Stein,
how the hell are you?

348
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:23,896
Not bad for an old guy.

349
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,642
Uh, 10:00, our usual place?

350
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:29,145
STEIN (ON PHONE): Suits me.

351
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:31,126
Are you all right?

352
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,273
Mm-hm.

353
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:34,671
Yeah, I just need
to talk to you.

354
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,097
I'll be there.

355
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,556
Bye.

356
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,155
[beep]

357
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:45,342
[music playing]

358
00:20:53,301 --> 00:21:00,357
(SINGING) All alone, I see you
standing there with nothing

359
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:02,929
left to show me but your tears.

360
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,421
Sorry I'm late.

361
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:12,139
I was beginning to think
you had a better offer.

362
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,364
I had an offer,
but it wasn't better.

363
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,133
Cheers.

364
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,761
Something's bothering you.

365
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,368
I'm OK.

366
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:33,446
Is it that bad?

367
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:39,910
Let me ask you a question.

368
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:44,359
If somebody offered you a big
break, something that could set

369
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:48,704
your life free, but
it involved something

370
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:55,273
that was against your
principles, would you do it?

371
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:57,497
Would you?

372
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,679
I dunno.

373
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:01,703
Marsha, you have your
whole life ahead of you.

374
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,406
And it'll be a good
life, if you let it.

375
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,758
I've been thinking
a lot about the past

376
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:17,240
lately, lamenting my regrets,
reveling in my accomplishments.

377
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,384
I thought about the time
we met in the art gallery,

378
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,408
and you came up to me as
if you'd known me forever.

379
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:32,810
You were the most magnificent
woman I'd ever seen.

380
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,687
And then you sold
me the Matthies.

381
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,287
It was a good buy.

382
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:40,039
I'd have bought out the whole
gallery if you asked me to.

383
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,395
I still have the Matthies.

384
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,333
I know.

385
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:43,793
It's worth double.

386
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:44,940
I'll never sell it.

387
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,988
You've never asked me
for anything, Marsha.

388
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:54,047
And whatever I've given you,
I've gotten back many times

389
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:55,402
over.

390
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,816
You're the closest I've
ever had to a family.

391
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:03,883
But if something's wrong,
honey, I wanna be able to help.

392
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:06,037
It's nothing, really.

393
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:09,896
I think I'm just feeling
a little bit guilty.

394
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,024
Well, I met somebody,
and I'm afraid I

395
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:14,657
may have blown it already.

396
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:18,968
So you slept with a
guy on the first date.

397
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,670
I wouldn't even
call it a date.

398
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,799
So you're having second
thoughts about him,

399
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,379
wondering if he
thinks you're easy,

400
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:30,125
or perhaps easy to forget?

401
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:32,036
Exactly.

402
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:35,720
If it'll make you
feel any better, Marsha,

403
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,493
you are not easy to forget.

404
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,888
What would I do without you?

405
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:46,182
You'll get by.

406
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:49,032
I promise.

407
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,466
[laughter]

408
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:55,879
Hi.

409
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:56,817
Oh, hey.

410
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:57,964
Better late than never.

411
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:01,649
Maddie, remember?

412
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,248
Of course.

413
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:04,256
Here you go.

414
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,715
You didn't have to do that.

415
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,897
I insist.

416
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,462
Now maybe you can tell
me what there is to do

417
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:12,042
around here for excitement.

418
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:17,741
Well, I just walked into this
bar and told 'em I was looking.

419
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,827
Asked me if I could tend bars.

420
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,218
I said sure.

421
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,998
Bingo, I'm a shot girl
at the Duke of Earl.

422
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:26,013
What is the Duke of Earl?

423
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:27,682
It's a strip place.

424
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:32,410
Very upscale, though, so they
call it "exotic dancing."

425
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,641
You know, guys come in,
drink, watch the girls.

426
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,901
So you're a stripper?

427
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:38,944
No, no.

428
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:40,195
Hardly.

429
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,705
No, the-- the shot girls
is where the real money is.

430
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:45,860
You just work the floor
pouring shots for guys,

431
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,529
and they tip you really great.

432
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:49,057
Sounds good to me.

433
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:50,378
What are you doing?

434
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:55,800
Uh, well, I guess I'm
back to waitressing.

435
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:58,059
I love your place.

436
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,588
Excuse my pigginess.

437
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,456
Don't worry about it.

438
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,749
You should see my place.

439
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:09,495
Jean, I have a big
favor I have to ask you.

440
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,884
Shoot.

441
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,248
Um, I don't know anybody
here, and I'm having

442
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:14,812
some money being wired to me.

443
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,064
Uh-huh.

444
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:17,558
And I don't have
a bank account yet.

445
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,470
So I was wondering if it
would be all right if I could

446
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:20,895
have it sent to your account.

447
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,293
You know, just for
now till I get setup.

448
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,371
I'll pay the charges and stuff.

449
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:25,934
Sure, when's it due?

450
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,368
Tomorrow, I hope.

451
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:30,001
Here, let me get it.

452
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:43,209
All my account
stuff's in here, so

453
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:44,599
just let me know
when they send it,

454
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,684
and I'll cash it out for you.

455
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:47,831
Great.

456
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,638
Thank you so much.

457
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:51,238
You know, you should
check out the Duke of Earl

458
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,323
if you need a job.
You should come by tonight.

459
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,366
I'm working.

460
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,686
Yeah?

461
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,007
Well, maybe I'll come
by and take a look.

462
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:57,876
OK.

463
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,023
It'd be fun to work together.

464
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:00,484
The place is a trip.

465
00:26:00,587 --> 00:26:01,422
Yeah?

466
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,160
Can't wait.

467
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,132
All right, I'll see you.

468
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,218
OK, bye-bye.

469
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:07,539
[music playing]

470
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:12,440
(SINGING) One, two--
one, two, three, four.

471
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:15,116
[cheering]

472
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:50,290
Driving in my car,
she slides next to me.

473
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:56,094
She puts her hand up
on my leg, shows me

474
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,188
where her interests be.

475
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:01,899
Oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh.

476
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:02,942
Can you feel it?

477
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,530
Yeah.

478
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:10,206
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

479
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,248
Can you feel it?

480
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:18,513
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

481
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:19,382
Can you feel it?

482
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:23,100
Dance and dance all night, baby.

483
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:26,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

484
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:27,862
Can you feel it?

485
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:39,123
On our way back home, gonna
turn the world around.

486
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:46,388
I'll take you into the
dark of night, speed south.

487
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:47,604
Rum and coke?

488
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:07,798
Hi.

489
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,587
Tabletop.

490
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:36,681
Tabletop.

491
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,245
Woo!

492
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,218
Tabletop!

493
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:44,397
Ah-hah!

494
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,201
Woo!

495
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:54,790
Yeah.

496
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:02,089
Woo!

497
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:04,625
$200 to lose the top.

498
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:06,433
200 bucks for the top.

499
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:09,665
200 bucks.

500
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,368
$200.

501
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:12,342
Top.

502
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,486
The top!

503
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,613
200 bucks.

504
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,707
$200 more for the top.

505
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:31,979
[chuckling]

506
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,385
Sorry, babe, wasn't
worth the extra.

507
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:53,425
Am I wrong?

508
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,058
Am I wrong?

509
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:56,100
Am I wrong?

510
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,824
What?
Was I wrong?

511
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,867
Was I wrong?

512
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,586
Was I wrong?

513
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,046
Are you OK?

514
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,583
What a jerk.

515
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,051
That bastard owes me $200.

516
00:30:16,156 --> 00:30:18,241
Don't worry about it, OK?

517
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:19,284
Be right back.

518
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,563
Good evening, sir.

519
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:30,962
I believe you owe the lady $250.

520
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,943
[chuckling]

521
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,959
They've called the police.

522
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:38,505
Now, give me the damn money, and
get your fat ass out of here.

523
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,609
He gave you an extra 50,
for pain and suffering.

524
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:03,633
Well, let me buy you a drink.

525
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:08,047
Two double stoli tonics on
the rocks, please, bartender.

526
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,312
Ooh, what a
night, what a night.

527
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,317
Just another
day at the office.

528
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:28,554
I'll make some coffee.

529
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:32,412
I know you need some.

530
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,525
No, no, no, no.

531
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:35,054
No coffee.

532
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:36,027
You got vodka?

533
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:41,519
Double vodka coming right up.

534
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,941
What a jerk.

535
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,201
And you, I don't believe you.

536
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:51,876
Yeah, well,
seeing is believing.

537
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:54,205
And I still can't believe
you took your clothes

538
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,090
off in front of all those guys.

539
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:02,547
Yeah, well, I guess
when someone is waving

540
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,354
the next month's
rent under your nose,

541
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,135
your inhibitions
go out the window.

542
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,316
Yeah, I know the feeling.

543
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:16,484
So anyway, on
to happier topics.

544
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:19,370
Tell me about your boyfriend.

545
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:23,608
Well, I don't even know if
I can call him my boyfriend.

546
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:26,286
We got real close, real quick.

547
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,336
And I don't know if I'm
afraid of hurting him

548
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,665
or he's afraid of
hurting me, but I

549
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:33,863
think we need some time apart.

550
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,357
Hm, been there.

551
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:40,362
Thing is, he's really
cute, incredibly nice.

552
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:42,309
And you wanna talk about money.

553
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:45,819
Ah, so finally
the truth comes out!

554
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:49,226
It helps, but
it's not the money.

555
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,223
I just can't stop
thinking about him.

556
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:55,933
Hm.

557
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:57,498
So what about you?

558
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,436
Ugh.

559
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,576
Well, there is this one guy
who comes into the club.

560
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,914
Everyone says he watches
me the whole night.

561
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:17,448
He never even watches the
show, just little old me.

562
00:33:17,553 --> 00:33:23,217
He wasn't there tonight, but
if he'd just say hello to me--

563
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,660
Ugh.

564
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:51,926
Oh, you saved my life.

565
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,908
What did I drink?

566
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,993
Not "what," my dear.

567
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:58,461
"How many."

568
00:33:58,565 --> 00:34:00,094
Get some sleep.

569
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:03,778
You're gonna feel
lousy in the morning.

570
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:05,586
MARSHA: Ugh.

571
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,985
WOMAN (ON PHONE): There's a Jean
Ivers to see you, Mr. Kronfeld.

572
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,582
HENRY (ON PHONE):
There's a what?

573
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:12,539
WOMAN (ON PHONE): A Miss Jean
Ivers is in the lobby, sir.

574
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:13,337
Well, all right.

575
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:14,450
I'm coming right down.

576
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,138
Jean Ivers, sir.

577
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:27,691
What the hell
are you doing here,

578
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:28,943
calling yourself Jean Ivers?

579
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,576
Would you relax, Henry?

580
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,758
It's OK.

581
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,851
Just get back
there and get on it.

582
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:37,597
You're seen here, I'm dead.

583
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,640
We're both dead.

584
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,482
Henry, I want out, OK?

585
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:41,872
She's a really nice girl.

586
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:43,575
I don't know what you're
planning to do to her,

587
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,669
but I don't want any part of it.

588
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:49,380
You don't what what?

589
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:51,952
You don't want what?

590
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:57,617
I set you up with the
deal of a lifetime!

591
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,598
Oh, no, no, missy.

592
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:01,823
We go back too far together.

593
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:05,785
You owe me money!

594
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:08,393
Now, you follow through on this,
or I'm gonna find your brother,

595
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:10,478
and I'm gonna end his
debt once and for all.

596
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:18,679
Just tell me you're
not gonna hurt her.

597
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:22,122
I already told
you, now just do it.

598
00:35:22,226 --> 00:35:26,257
You better eat, sleep,
and breathe Jean Ivers.

599
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:35,641
Hey, it's not like you
to fall for a mark, huh?

600
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:37,970
I mean, what happened
to the old Marsha.

601
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,490
All right, I'll do it.

602
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:43,636
But after this, we're through.

603
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,617
Clean slate.

604
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:49,058
And if anything happens to her,
Henry, I'm going to the cops.

605
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:51,039
Hey, nothing's gonna happen.

606
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:51,978
Promise.

ANSWERING MACHINE: You have
reached the office of Mr Stein.

609
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,861
Mr. Stein is not
available at the moment.

00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,503

The new girl get here yet?

615
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:38,725
Yeah, she's
trying on an outfit.

616
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,359
Oh, good.

617
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,931
But I don't think how it looks
on her is gonna be a problem.

618
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:43,904
Who's that?

619
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,979
Did you see that?

620
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,030
Oh, my gosh.

621
00:36:51,134 --> 00:36:52,593
You got it, baby.

622
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:53,706
Great!

00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:57,355
Hello?

00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,294

Hey.

627
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:04,932
Oh, your wire came through.

628
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:06,497
You want the cash?

629
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,068
Oh, I'm not quite set up
yet. you think you could hang

630
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,910
on to it for a couple days?

631
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,092
Sure.

632
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:15,534
Try not to spend it.

633
00:37:15,637 --> 00:37:17,584
Guess what?

634
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:18,661
I got the job.

635
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:19,669
Get outta here.

636
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:20,608
I'm a cocktail waitress.

637
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:21,580
That's great.

638
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,968
- Can you do me a favor?
- Hm.

639
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:28,358
I left my soda out
on the patio table.

640
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:29,610
Can you grab it for me?

641
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,583
Yeah.

642
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,901
You wicked girl, you.

643
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,535
You knew, didn't you?

644
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:47,614
Oops.

645
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:48,621
Good shot.

646
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,594
Pour.

647
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:58,493
OK, to, um-- to great wealth.

648
00:37:58,596 --> 00:38:00,161
I think I've reached
the point where I can

649
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:03,567
safely say that's passed me by.

650
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:04,888
Don't let it.

Even if you have to
trip it on its way up.

652

If I had your looks,
I'd go for it too.

653
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:16,566
It's-- it's not looks.

654
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,374
It's attitude.

655
00:38:18,478 --> 00:38:20,633
There's this older
friend that I have.

656
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:22,927
He's always given me as
much as I've given him.

companionship, no questions

659
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:32,207
He happens to be wealthy, but
he's got such style and grace

660
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,363
that even if he
didn't own a dime,

661
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,621
you'd still wanna
spend time with him.

662
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,880
He's amazing.

MARSHA: No.

665
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:43,642
No, he's way too
classy for that.

666
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:50,246
Have you heard
from your boyfriend?

667
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,609
He could be a dead issue.

668
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:55,737
He hasn't called.

669
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:57,997

You know, I gotta tell you,
ever since I met you it's--

I don't know what happened.

687
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,554
I was so numb and indifferent.

688
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:59,959
And now-- I dunno.

Everything just seemed so
black and white before,

00:43:03,312 --> 00:43:04,250
That's the guy.

723
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:05,223
He's cute.

724
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:09,464
Relax.

725
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:10,402

MAN: A special delivery.

776
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:08,428
Oh, thank you.

777
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,485
[phone ringing]

778
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:28,655
Hello.

779
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:30,324
Hello, Marsha.

780
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:31,992
Henry.

781
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:34,807
Listen, I don't know
how to tell you this,

782
00:46:34,912 --> 00:46:37,101
but I got a call
from the DA's office,

783
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,611
and they're-- they're
asking about you.

784
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:42,176
I don't know how much they know.

785
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:45,548
I couldn't get a read, but
you better get out of there

786
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:48,503
and lie low for a while.

787
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:51,803
I knew it was too
good to be true.

788
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:52,916
Where's Jean?

789
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,271
Listen, don't worry about her.

790
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:56,079
Worry about yourself.

791
00:46:56,184 --> 00:46:57,122
Go to your manager.

792
00:46:57,227 --> 00:46:58,929
Give him some sort of a story.

793
00:46:59,034 --> 00:47:00,667
Go down to Key West.

794
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:02,509

It's OK, boss, It's OK.

799
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:56,105
She's on her way to the Keys.

800
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,321
I'm coming back to town.

801
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:22,242
[phone ringing]

802
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:23,735
Hello.

803
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,196

Miss Thomas, we just
signed something for you.

806
00:48:30,479 --> 00:48:31,417
It's very important.

807
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,086
Can you hear me?

808
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,137
Miss Tho-- it's very important.

809
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:37,847
Must call Stein's office.

810
00:48:37,951 --> 00:48:38,890

Hello?

812
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:41,045
Miss Thomas?

- Hello, operator.

you could help me.

WOMAN (ON PHONE):
Oh, Miss Thomas.

822
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:27,967
Thank you so much
for calling back.

823
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:29,740
Something has come
up, and did you know

824
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:31,616
that Mr. Stein has been ill?

825
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:33,041
What?
I didn't.

826
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:34,502
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Listen,
try to get over here.

827
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:35,926
I can't discuss it on the phone.

828
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:37,560
We need to see you
as soon as possible.

829
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,253
Hey!

830
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:51,949
Can you give me a ride to Miami?

831
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:52,958
Sure, hop in.

832
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,087
Henry, this is Miss Jones.

833
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:06,721
She's been doing some
document transfers for us.

834
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:09,189
She always helps to
track down Miss Thomas.

835
00:50:09,293 --> 00:50:10,788
And this is Mr. Stevens.

836
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:14,055
Mr. Stevens is the trust nominee
for the estate of Mr. Stein.

837
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:14,993
How do you do?

838
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:16,210
I'll be brief.

839
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,634
I'm sure you're both
anxious to hear the terms.

840
00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:19,512
Uh, Miss Thomas
has been advised

841
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,494
that she's one of
the beneficiaries

842
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:24,448
to Mr. Stein's estate.

843
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:28,756
However, naturally, we're
not aware of the specifics.

844
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:29,695
Quite.

845
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:31,989
Miss Thomas?

846
00:50:32,093 --> 00:50:33,032
You can call me Marsha.

847
00:50:42,902 --> 00:50:47,039
Miss Thomas, shortly
before Mr. Stein died,

848
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,923
he created a living trust,
you as the beneficiary

849
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,287
and I am the trustee.

850
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:55,173
At your direction, however,
I may remain as trustee,

851
00:50:55,277 --> 00:50:56,875
or you may appoint
whomsoever you

852
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,413
wish as a replacement trustee.

853
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,915
Is this clear to you?

854
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:02,888
Perfectly.

855
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:03,966
Good.

856
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,225
He also intimated to
me that he trusted

857
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,927
your judgment implicitly.

858
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:10,466
So I must now ask you
if you wish to appoint

859
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:11,820
a replacement trustee.

860
00:51:11,925 --> 00:51:13,420
Yes, she does.

861
00:51:13,524 --> 00:51:17,452
And here is the appropriate
appointment document nominating

862
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:23,360
myself as trustee and the firm
of T Markowitz and Kronfeld

863
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:26,280
as legal advisors.

864
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:27,218
Yes.

865
00:51:27,323 --> 00:51:28,608
Very efficient.

866
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:30,347
Thank you.

867
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:33,371
May we we know
the exact terms?

868
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:36,221
Well, the list is quite long.

869
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:42,059
It's approximately $2 million
in cash, about six million

870
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:45,639
in stocks, shares,
and other assets.

871
00:51:45,743 --> 00:51:49,984
This is a schedule of the
assets and their disposition.

872
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:54,155
I will prepare my resignation
paper with your appointment

873
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:55,649
as replacement trustee.

874
00:51:55,753 --> 00:51:57,492
Those papers have to
be filed in court.

875
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:59,750
It may take a few days.

876
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:03,505
Meanwhile, I will
follow your directions.

877
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:06,771
Miss Thomas, I'd like to
reiterate a conversation

878
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,892
that I had with Henry.

879
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:12,055
With your permission, of course.

880
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,685
Miss Thomas, Mr. Stein
was a very private person.

881
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:20,674
Now, while he had
no immediate family,

882
00:52:20,778 --> 00:52:22,412
he did have some
very close friends

883
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:27,383
and associates who will
not benefit to the extent

884
00:52:27,488 --> 00:52:29,190
that you will.

885
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:34,924
In short, Mr. Stein
was very discreet.

886
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:37,600
We feel that it would be
in everyone's best interest

887
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:41,876
if your windfall, as
it were, were held

888
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:43,962
with a level of
discretion that Mr. Stein

889
00:52:44,066 --> 00:52:46,048
would have deemed appropriate.

890
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:47,993
In short, this is
a private affair,

891
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:53,137
I mean, private matter,
and not for publication.

892
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:55,188
Mr. Hayes speaks
perfect English.

893
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:58,733
You don't have to translate.

894
00:52:58,837 --> 00:53:03,565
What Mr. Stein and I did or
didn't do is nobody's business.

895
00:53:03,668 --> 00:53:06,380
I understand, Mr.
Hayes, is that it?

896
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,536
That's it, Miss Thomas.

897
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,420
I'll be in touch,
as will Mr. Stevens.

898
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:14,548
I'll see you in
the coffee shop.

899
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:15,590
Thank you.

900
00:53:18,024 --> 00:53:19,066
Thank you.

901
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:26,574
I've never had
a trustee before.

902
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:30,118
Well, you got one now, and
we're gonna have a lot of fun.

903
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:31,544
What did you do with Marsha?

904
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:33,317
I mean, you are gonna give
her a chunk of change,

905
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:34,637
like you said, right?

906
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:36,445
I got a little problem
with that right now,

907
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:37,869
but we'll work it out.

908
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:39,434
Right now,m it's best that
you lay low in the house

909
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:40,789
for a couple of days.

910
00:53:40,893 --> 00:53:44,091
Well, aren't we
going to the Bahamas?

911
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:45,377
You sure are.

912
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:55,839
WOMAN: Miss Thomas,
Mr. Stein died

913
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:58,203
rather suddenly a few days ago.

914
00:54:03,973 --> 00:54:05,432
I'm really sorry to be
the one to tell you this.

915
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:09,429
Can I, uh, get you
a glass of water?

916
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:11,098
No.

917
00:54:11,202 --> 00:54:12,661
No, thank you.

918
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:19,126
It was all very sudden, and
we were all pretty shocked.

919
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:22,394
He was a wonderful man.

920
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:23,332
Yes.

921
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:27,051
Thank you.

922
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,732
[music playing]

923
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:03,407
[sobbing]

924
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:53,735
Matt.

925
00:56:03,014 --> 00:56:04,545
Thanks for coming.

926
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:08,264
It's OK.

927
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:15,805
It's OK to cry.

928
00:56:15,909 --> 00:56:18,483
He was all I had
when my brother left.

929
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:20,498
He was always there for me.

930
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:24,391
This is so unfair.

931
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,151
Feeling any better?

932
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:44,445
A little bit.

933
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,626
I made you some tea.

934
00:56:50,354 --> 00:56:53,064
I have some things
I have to tell you.

935
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:57,549
And after I've said
what I have to say,

936
00:56:57,653 --> 00:56:59,148
I hope you'll still
wanna be with me.

937
00:57:13,954 --> 00:57:16,978
What is it, Cassandra?

938
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:19,966
First of all, my
name's not "Cassandra."

939
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:21,079
It's "Marsha."

940
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,544
[dialing]

941
00:57:32,097 --> 00:57:32,827
HENRY (ON PHONE): Hello.

942
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:35,781
They are both in the house.

943
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:36,998
What do you want me to do?

944
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:38,006
HENRY (ON PHONE):
I can talk to you

945
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,925
right now, so just sit tight.

946
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:42,732
Give it a half hour.

947
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:45,756
And if there's no movement, go
on over to my house and check

948
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,946
on the other girl.

949
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,267
Um, introduce yourself.

950
00:57:49,371 --> 00:57:50,935
Tell her you work for
me and you're there just

951
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:53,681
to see if she needs anything.

952
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:58,373
Just make sure she stays put.

953
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,354
Check with me later.
- OK, boss.

954
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:05,985
Henry, we've begun to
liquidate all the stocks

955
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,314
and other assets as
you've instructed,

956
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,607
selling them at
current market value.

957
00:58:10,712 --> 00:58:13,285
You know, Mr. Stein had sold
off most of his securities,

958
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,432
so the remainder
can be liquidated

959
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:17,456
within, oh, five business days.

960
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,123
As for the cash
and other assets,

961
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:21,104
they'll be transferred
immediately.

962
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,530
Yeah, yeah.

963
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:23,538
Here you go.

964
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:25,727
The First Bahamian Bank.

965
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:29,133
Yes, I know it well.

966
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:32,886
I assume you'll take care of
the regulatory requirements?

967
00:58:32,992 --> 00:58:35,286
As soon as possible.

968
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,953
Ah.

969
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:39,664
It shall be done.

970
00:58:39,768 --> 00:58:42,931
Henry, I'm awfully sorry
to lose this account.

971
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:45,435
I'm assuming that you
are not unhappy with us.

972
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:46,408
Oh, no, no.

973
00:58:46,512 --> 00:58:47,416
Nothing like that.

974
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,875
It's just business.

975
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:50,057
Ah-huh.

976
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:52,247
And Miss Thomas is aware
of what you're doing?

977
00:58:52,351 --> 00:58:55,131
Actually, it was
at her direction.

978
00:58:55,236 --> 00:58:56,938
She wants to keep it
liquid, and thought it best

979
00:58:57,043 --> 00:58:59,268
that we keep it all offshore.

980
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:02,396
She's a very sharp lady.

981
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,335
Thank you.

982
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,632
[knocking]

983
00:59:23,736 --> 00:59:27,073
(SINGING) And I need
someone to believe in.

984
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:31,661
Just give me someone
to believe in.

985
00:59:31,765 --> 00:59:37,466
Just give me-- and I
was lying to myself.

986
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,227
This is me and no
one else, I know.

987
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,772
Someone to believe in.

988
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:50,361
Just give me someone
to believe in.

989
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:54,323
Jose, what are you doing here?

990
00:59:54,427 --> 00:59:56,686
Don't I get a kiss?

991
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,112
Huh?

992
00:59:58,216 --> 00:59:59,119
Of course you do.

993
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:06,314
How did you find me?

994
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:07,912
I'm working for him.

995
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:13,995
He hired me to
keep an eye on you.

996
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:15,038
Isn't that something?

997
01:00:15,142 --> 01:00:16,845
Jesus, did you tell him that--

998
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:20,113
No, do you think I'm crazy?

999
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:22,477
Hang on a minute.

1000
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,457
What, so all those evenings
at the Duke of Earl,

1001
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:28,072
what you were working
for him, watching me?

1002
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:30,400
It's great work
if you can get it.

1003
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,613
Does he know that
you're here now?

1004
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,734
He asked me to come
over and introduce myself.

1005
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:42,669
This is too bizarre.

1006
01:00:49,969 --> 01:00:53,201
Did he say anything about us?

1007
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:55,703
I mean, about me and him?

1008
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:57,024
Mm-mm.

1009
01:00:57,128 --> 01:00:59,562
I'm strictly field work.

1010
01:00:59,665 --> 01:01:06,374
You know, surveillance,
sometimes persuasion.

1011
01:01:06,479 --> 01:01:12,595
Whatever he needs
done, I do for a price

1012
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,229
and the fringe benefits.

1013
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:23,960
How about a little more
enthusiasm, dear, huh?

1014
01:01:24,065 --> 01:01:27,888
You know Henry's
gonna come by.

1015
01:01:27,993 --> 01:01:29,522
No, I didn't know.

1016
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:36,021
We'd better hurry up, then.

1017
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:40,262
WOMAN (ON RADIO): This is Tina
Martell, with 93.9 FM Love 94.

steamy day in Miami.

Expect a high in the mid-90s.

1020
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:49,681

I'm gonna kiss you
all over, baby.

I'm gonna take you there.

So take it slow and easy.

01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,824
I'm gonna take you there.

1069
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:24,687
What did you mean
by "persuasion"?

1070
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:25,939
Hm?

1071
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:28,893
"Persuasion,"
what did you mean?

1072
01:05:28,997 --> 01:05:30,006
Oh, whatever it takes.

1073
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:36,436
What, like you beat people up?

1074
01:05:39,632 --> 01:05:42,483
It's generally
helping them to remember

1075
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:45,403
late payments and stuff.

1076
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:46,550
Oh.

1077
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:47,593
Well, is there
something that you

1078
01:05:47,696 --> 01:05:50,651
were gonna help me to remember?

1079
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:54,891
No, you were
only half the job.

1080
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:59,862
I had to take out that girl
you work with, Marsha somebody.

1081
01:05:59,966 --> 01:06:01,079
Only, I'm still on the case.

1082
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:07,404
You were gonna kill her?

1083
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:11,123
Well, I was gonna
do what I was told to.

1084
01:06:16,093 --> 01:06:17,830
I'm gonna be sick.

1085
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:19,707
Come on, I thought you knew.

1086
01:06:19,812 --> 01:06:20,646
Come on, hurry.

1087
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,758
Get dressed.

1088
01:06:21,863 --> 01:06:23,774
Henry's gonna be here soon.

1089
01:06:23,878 --> 01:06:24,747
Where is Marsha now?

1090
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:29,892
Where is she?

1091
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:33,020
She's playing with Matt
Conrad over at his place

1092
01:06:33,124 --> 01:06:35,314
in the Gables.

1093
01:06:35,418 --> 01:06:36,357
HENRY: Jean, it's Henry.

1094
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:39,346
Oh, my god.

1095
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:42,612
Come on, hurry.

1096
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:43,552
Jean?

1097
01:06:43,655 --> 01:06:44,525
JEAN: I'm coming.

1098
01:06:50,746 --> 01:06:52,831
Come on, get that little
money maker over here.

1099
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:04,440
You OK?

1100
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:05,413
Yeah.

1101
01:07:05,518 --> 01:07:07,707
Hey, did you meet Jose?

1102
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:09,653
Uh-huh.

1103
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:14,347
Listen, there's
been a change in plan.

1104
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:17,509
I've gotta go upstate on
business for a couple of days.

1105
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:20,533
Uh, we'll go to the Bahamas
when I come back, OK?

1106
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:23,557
Jose'll take care of you.

1107
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,120
Where is he?

1108
01:07:25,225 --> 01:07:26,059
I don't know.

1109
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:27,692
I think he--

1110
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:29,223
Jose?

1111
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:30,056
Jose?

1112
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,098
You wanted me, Boss?

1113
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:32,732
I was in the little boys' room.

1114
01:07:32,837 --> 01:07:34,505
HENRY: Yeah, come down here.

1115
01:07:37,806 --> 01:07:41,839
Yeah, you wanna, uh, grab
the luggage, take it outside?

1116
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:04,917
You can forget about
Marsha for a while.

1117
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:05,890
Stick with this one.

1118
01:08:08,671 --> 01:08:10,165
I got some papers.

1119
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:12,286
They're very important papers.

1120
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:17,882
Keep them away from her,
out of sight, and sealed.

1121
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:18,889
Claro?

1122
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,037
You got it, Boss.

1123
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,459
It's, uh, in the
brown envelope.

1124
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:47,321
What's that?

1125
01:08:47,426 --> 01:08:49,442
Something for Henry.

1126
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,979
Oh, well, here, I'll take it.

1127
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:54,411
No.

1128
01:08:54,516 --> 01:08:56,879
He wants me to keep it safe.

1129
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:57,852
No peeking.

1130
01:09:02,162 --> 01:09:07,550
Well, what do you
say we have a drink?

1131
01:09:10,365 --> 01:09:12,659
Maybe it'd put us in the mood?

1132
01:09:12,763 --> 01:09:13,631
Maybe.

1133
01:09:24,163 --> 01:09:25,032
I'll get the glasses.

1134
01:09:32,471 --> 01:09:33,339
Ugh.

1135
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:54,506
[honking]

1136
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:55,549
Open up, please.

1137
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:57,078
Please, open up.

1138
01:09:57,182 --> 01:09:58,052
Oh, god, it's Jean.

1139
01:09:58,156 --> 01:09:59,163
Let her in.

1140
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:04,377
Jean, I'm so glad you're OK.

1141
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:05,697
Do you know what's going on?

1142
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,818
JEAN: Mr. Stein had
created a trust for you.

1143
01:10:07,922 --> 01:10:09,972
And-- and Henry had
got his hands on it.

1144
01:10:10,077 --> 01:10:11,641
MARSHA: Can you
believe this guy?

1145
01:10:11,745 --> 01:10:13,726
JEAN: He was playing you
against me and me against you.

1146
01:10:13,831 --> 01:10:16,855
Oh, remember that-- that
guy, Jose from the club?

1147
01:10:16,959 --> 01:10:19,393
Ugh, did he turn out
to be a nightmare.

1148
01:10:19,497 --> 01:10:20,851
Come on, sit down.

1149
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:22,173
- Jean, this is Matt.
- Hi.

1150
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:23,007
Hi.

1151
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:24,744
I've heard a lot about you.

1152
01:10:24,848 --> 01:10:26,100
Same here.

1153
01:10:26,205 --> 01:10:27,352
All right, take your time.

1154
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,569
Tell us from the beginning.

1155
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:29,715
OK.

1156
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:34,477
Oh, first off, you have
to call Mr. Stevens.

1157
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:36,389
He's Stein's lawyer.

1158
01:10:36,493 --> 01:10:37,674
That's his number.

1159
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,898
And I don't care
what happens to me.

1160
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:41,775
I'm just so glad you're OK.

1161
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,522
Nothing's gonna
happen to you, but wait

1162
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:46,121
till I get my hands on Henry.

1163
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:47,754
JEAN: Well, you'd
better move fast,

1164
01:10:47,858 --> 01:10:49,665
'cause I think he's trying to
do something with your money.

1165
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:10,486
MATT: Yes, here it is, the Henry
Kronfeld financial records.

1166
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,751
Now we can access
his bank accounts.

1167
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:15,595
[typing]

1168
01:11:15,698 --> 01:11:17,541
Hm, looks like your friend
Henry is moving everything

1169
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:20,460
to a bank in the Bahamas.

1170
01:11:20,565 --> 01:11:22,719
Let's see what we
can do about that.

1171
01:11:22,823 --> 01:11:27,029
Let's give the system
10, 15 minutes.

1172
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:28,454
It pays to do a little hacking.

1173
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,718
May I get you coffee?

1174
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:37,039
He said it won't be long.

1175
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:38,116
What?

1176
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:40,237
May I get you coffee?

1177
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:41,626
No, no, no.
That's-- that's OK.

1178
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,226
WOMAN: If you need a
phone to call the States,

1179
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,797
there's one right over there.

1180
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:46,666
Oh, no.

1181
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:48,510
I'm sure everything's OK, yeah.

1182
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:53,687
[door opens]

1183
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:58,519
Mr. Kronfeld, sorry
to have kept you.

1184
01:11:58,623 --> 01:11:59,493
Oh, thank you.

1185
01:12:03,524 --> 01:12:05,610
May I offer you
something to drink?

1186
01:12:05,713 --> 01:12:06,791
Oh, no, no, no.

1187
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:10,476
Let's-- let's just get
right down to business.

1188
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:15,412
You did receive the wire
transfers into my account?

1189
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:16,696
Indeed, we received the wires.

1190
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:17,843
Well, all right, good.

1191
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:19,164
Now, here's what
I want you to do.

1192
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:21,980
I want you to divide
the transfers into three

1193
01:12:22,084 --> 01:12:24,482
separate accounts,
and then wire transfer

1194
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:29,592
them to these three different
banks in Switzerland right now.

1195
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:32,998
I'm afraid we can't
do that, Mr. Kronfeld.

1196
01:12:33,102 --> 01:12:35,223
What?

1197
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,064
I'm afraid we can't do that.

1198
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:38,871
Excuse me.

1199
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:43,251
Did you or did you not,
uh, receive the transfer.

1200
01:12:43,355 --> 01:12:44,259
We did.

1201
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:47,144
All right, so
then what's problem?

1202
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:51,489
Mr. Kronfeld, the money
was transferred and credited

1203
01:12:51,593 --> 01:12:55,763
to your account here, but
a short time ago, the money

1204
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:59,135
was removed from your
account here and transferred

1205
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,741
to a stateside account.

1206
01:13:01,846 --> 01:13:02,958
What?

1207
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:05,566
It appears that
of the $8 million

1208
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:11,717
that was transferred into your
account, only $75 was left in.

1209
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,211
$75?

1210
01:13:13,317 --> 01:13:15,679
That's the amount that
appears on your account balance.

1211
01:13:15,784 --> 01:13:19,085
Would you like to leave
it in or withdraw it?

1212
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,109
I am the sole
appointed trustee.

1213
01:13:22,213 --> 01:13:26,176
I mean, I did not grant you
the authority to do that.

1214
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,408
I'm afraid we have no say
in the matter, Mr. Kronfeld.

1215
01:13:29,513 --> 01:13:33,441
I suggest you take it up
with your bank in the States.

1216
01:13:33,545 --> 01:13:35,039
[phone ringing]

1217
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,499
Yes?

1218
01:13:36,603 --> 01:13:39,489
WOMAN (ON PHONE): I have a long
distance call for Mr. Kronfeld.

1219
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:40,948
Put it through.

1220
01:13:41,052 --> 01:13:41,921
Mr. Kronfeld.

1221
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:46,614
Hello.

1222
01:13:46,717 --> 01:13:48,281
Nice try, you bastard.

1223
01:13:48,386 --> 01:13:50,437
The $75 is to get
your ass back here,

1224
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,217
and we'll settle our
accounts once and for all.

1225
01:13:53,322 --> 01:13:55,616
Oh, and don't try using
your credit cards.

1226
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:57,110
We've terminated your accounts.

1227
01:14:09,865 --> 01:14:10,838
Are you all right, sir?

1228
01:14:14,106 --> 01:14:14,975
Sir?

1229
01:14:18,798 --> 01:14:24,151
Can-- can I withdraw
the $75 right now?

1230
01:14:24,255 --> 01:14:25,507
All right, now just relax.

1231
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:26,897
See the yellow ball?

1232
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:28,182
That's the two ball.

1233
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:29,677
Now, just hit it real
easy on the side.

1234
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:51,504
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.

1235
01:14:51,609 --> 01:14:56,093
Now, we-- uh, we gotta
work something out.

1236
01:14:56,197 --> 01:14:57,414
I mean, and--

1237
01:14:57,518 --> 01:14:59,777
And nothing, you bastard.

1238
01:14:59,881 --> 01:15:01,202
Where's my money?

1239
01:15:01,306 --> 01:15:03,634
It's right where it's supposed
to be-- in my trust account.

1240
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:05,338
I'm the trustee.

1241
01:15:05,442 --> 01:15:07,666
You don't touch it
unless I say so.

1242
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,917
So long as you're the trustee.

1243
01:15:09,022 --> 01:15:11,003
Well, you got the picture.

1244
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:14,271
Well, Henry,
you've been replaced.

1245
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,773
I've been replaced, huh?

1246
01:15:16,877 --> 01:15:19,275
I've been replaced.

1247
01:15:19,379 --> 01:15:20,422
I've been replaced.

1248
01:15:23,377 --> 01:15:26,262
Well, I'll tell you what.

1249
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:27,686
We'll split it 50/50.

1250
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:31,337
It's a win-win situation
for both of us.

1251
01:15:31,441 --> 01:15:33,317
No, no more deals, Henry.

1252
01:15:33,422 --> 01:15:35,958
Besides, you don't have
much to bargain with.

1253
01:15:36,062 --> 01:15:38,183
Oh, what about your friend?

1254
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,582
I mean, right now, she's
in a lot of trouble.

1255
01:15:40,685 --> 01:15:41,763
Come on, Henry.

1256
01:15:41,867 --> 01:15:43,397
Is that the best you can do?

1257
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:44,926
If she goes down, you go down.

1258
01:15:48,124 --> 01:15:49,653
[pool balls clack]

1259
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:52,781
I'll tell you what.

1260
01:15:52,885 --> 01:15:56,605
We'll flip a coin for it,
Winner takes everything.

1261
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:58,342
No, no.

1262
01:15:58,447 --> 01:15:59,836
I don't like games of chance.

1263
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,236
How about a game of skill?

1264
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,460
Name it.

1265
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:07,205
One game of eight ball.

1266
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:09,256
We play for it.

1267
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:10,994
You-- you don't know
what to think, do you?

1268
01:16:11,098 --> 01:16:11,932
Am I conning?

1269
01:16:12,036 --> 01:16:13,496
Are you conning me?

1270
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:15,060
I mean, I watched you play.

1271
01:16:15,165 --> 01:16:17,042
I could be thinking, "This
is gonna be a piece of cake."

1272
01:16:17,146 --> 01:16:18,883
Don't listen to him.
He's conning you.

1273
01:16:18,987 --> 01:16:19,856
Shut up!

1274
01:16:22,776 --> 01:16:24,757
So what's it gonna be, slim?

1275
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:28,233
We flip a coin or
we play for it?

1276
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:31,118
If you win, I sign
off as trustee,

1277
01:16:31,222 --> 01:16:34,836
and your brother's
debt is history.

1278
01:16:34,942 --> 01:16:36,227
And if you win?

1279
01:16:36,332 --> 01:16:37,270
I'll be generous.

1280
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:40,016
We'll split everything 50/50.

1281
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,275
Henry, why the hell
should I trust you?

1282
01:16:42,379 --> 01:16:44,152
A deal's a deal.

1283
01:16:44,256 --> 01:16:46,862
Tell you what,
you've got the break,

1284
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:49,470
and I'll let you keep shooting
till you sink the first one.

1285
01:16:49,574 --> 01:16:50,583
Now, how's that for a deal?

1286
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:56,768
it's your money.

1287
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:58,924
I didn't introduce you.

1288
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:01,218
Henry, this is Matt Conrad.

1289
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:02,573
He's the owner of
that Ferrari you

1290
01:17:02,677 --> 01:17:05,110
had sent down to South America.

1291
01:17:05,215 --> 01:17:07,439
Oh, well, sorry about that.

1292
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:08,377
Rack 'em.

1293
01:17:19,638 --> 01:17:20,785
What the hell was that?

1294
01:17:20,889 --> 01:17:24,713
You outsmarted yourself,
you greedy bastard.

1295
01:17:24,818 --> 01:17:27,216
Remember the Henry
Kronfeld con rules.

1296
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:32,534
First, know your mark.

1297
01:17:32,637 --> 01:17:38,685
Their likes, dislikes,
history, and abilities.

1298
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:39,658
Excuse me.

1299
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:44,247
Take nothing for granted.

1300
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:51,754
Everything is significant,
down to the last detail.

1301
01:18:00,374 --> 01:18:01,313
Excuse me.

1302
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:06,318
Not knowing something
can be fatal.

1303
01:18:20,568 --> 01:18:21,507
All right.

1304
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:22,550
Shit.

1305
01:18:22,653 --> 01:18:24,704
Well, guess the news.

1306
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:26,024
When I was in
college, my brother

1307
01:18:26,129 --> 01:18:28,354
Frankie couldn't always
afford my incidentals,

1308
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,396
so I played pool.

1309
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,933
Three hours a day,
seven days a week.

1310
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:34,576
Now, sign the papers and
get the hell outta here.

1311
01:18:42,257 --> 01:18:43,195
Here you go, big man.

1312
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:50,042
Henry, I've got
your dick in a bangle.

1313
01:18:50,146 --> 01:18:53,379
Any more shit from you
and I'll turn the handle.

1314
01:18:56,263 --> 01:18:57,167
Give me that.

1315
01:18:57,271 --> 01:19:00,330
Just sign the papers.

1316
01:19:00,434 --> 01:19:01,512
Can I read this first?

1317
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:02,485
Sign it.

1318
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:08,324
So where are you taking me?

1319
01:19:08,429 --> 01:19:09,992
What's the big secret?

1320
01:19:10,096 --> 01:19:11,243
Oh, you'll see.

1321
01:19:11,348 --> 01:19:13,884
I told you, it pays to do
a little bit of hacking.

1322
01:19:36,616 --> 01:19:37,971
Do you live here?

1323
01:19:38,076 --> 01:19:39,709
Why are you asking?

1324
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:43,012
Yeah, why are you asking?

1325
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:44,506
Is your dad home?

1326
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,287
My stepdad is.

1327
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:48,920
Why don't you
get some lemonade.

1328
01:19:49,024 --> 01:19:49,893
I'll be right back.

1329
01:19:55,767 --> 01:19:58,165
OK, let's have one
lemonade, please.

1330
01:20:02,823 --> 01:20:03,760
Thank you.

1331
01:20:03,866 --> 01:20:04,977
You're welcome.

1332
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:19,889
Frankie?

1333
01:20:25,624 --> 01:20:27,292
Frankie!

1334
01:20:27,396 --> 01:20:28,231
Oh.

1335
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:39,422
I thought I'd never
see you again.

1336
01:20:39,527 --> 01:20:41,820
I didn't wanna cause
you any more trouble.

1337
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:42,758
You're my family.

1338
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:48,771
I was so worried about you.

1339
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:54,853
I've been looking
and looking for you.

1340
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:57,322
I've been cleaning up my life.

1341
01:20:57,427 --> 01:21:00,381
I've been on the
wagon for two years,

1342
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:04,968
and I didn't even bet $1 on
the Super Bowl this year.

1343
01:21:05,072 --> 01:21:05,906
Oh, Frankie!

1344
01:21:09,557 --> 01:21:11,120
I thought I'd never
see you again.

1345
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:23,390
I guess you two have a lot
of, uh, catching up to do.

1346
01:21:23,494 --> 01:21:27,699
Um, we have a lot
of catching up to do.

1347
01:21:27,803 --> 01:21:29,368
[chuckling]

1348
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:32,322
[music playing]

1349
01:21:32,427 --> 01:21:36,493
(SINGING) I don't care
how it's supposed to be,

1350
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:43,340
only what you mean to me, how
I'd feel if you were gone.

1351
01:21:47,372 --> 01:21:51,265
You said that we
would never cry.

1352
01:21:54,844 --> 01:21:57,522
You said we'd never say goodbye.

1353
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:04,542
But that was long ago.

1354
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:09,582
More than yesterday.

1355
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:17,749
It was once upon a magic moment.

1356
01:22:22,547 --> 01:22:35,580
We had suns and silver moons and
the sky was filled with wonder.

1357
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:44,443
It was the greatest
love I've ever known.

1358
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:13,812
You said we'd never say goodbye.

1359
01:23:19,304 --> 01:23:21,981
You said that we
would never cry.

1360
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:30,913
That was long ago.

1361
01:23:31,017 --> 01:23:35,708
More than yesterday.

1362
01:23:39,463 --> 01:23:43,426
It was once upon a magic moment.

1363
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:52,810
La, la, la, la.

1364
01:23:55,626 --> 01:24:03,202
It was once upon a magic moment.
