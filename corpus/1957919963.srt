00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,545
in any of the pictures
that you sent me.

182
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,372
You sent pictures?

183
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,549
Grandma, can I speak
to you, please?

184
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,507
Of course.

185
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,335
My darling, why don't
you help yourself

186
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,902
to some pralines
in the living room?

187
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,469
They're my specialty.

188
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,992
- Thank you.
- So good.

189
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,128
I'm sure I don't know why

190
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,869
are you looking at
your grandma like that.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,002
You didn't tell me I was
going to have a partner.

192
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,960
Didn't I? Must have
slipped my mind.

193
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,851
Grandma, you are the
smartest woman I've ever met.

194
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,660
Nothing slips your mind.

195
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,590
I thought you could use
some help, that's all.

196
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,099
And she seems like the
perfect person to give it.

197
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,797
For the record, I am capable
of doing this on my own.

198
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:17,584
And if I hate the designs you
two come up with, you can.

199
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,543
But right now, you have to
at least try it with Grace.

200
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,328
This is what I want.

201
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,157
Okay, I'll try.

202
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:29,378
- [Loretta sighs]
- I'll try.

203
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,641
- Good.
- Grace... she's a good architect.

204
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,078
We're just very different.

205
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,125
You know what they say
about opposites, don't you?

206
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,698
Oh, oh, oh.

207
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:49,529
I'm so sorry. They
are just so good.

208
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:53,010
Of course. No one can
resist a Miss Loretta treat.

209
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,230
That's a praline promise.

210
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,537
Why don't you and Anthony
take a look around my house

211
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,539
and start coming
up with some ideas?

212
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,105
Don't you want to
brief us first?

213
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:03,020
I'll be brief.

214
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,892
Make the house look phenomenal.

215
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,371
Okay.

216
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,857
- Should we, uh...
- Let's start upstairs.

217
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,034
Oh, okay.

218
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:22,407
ANTHONY: So the house
was built in 1888,

219
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,303
and it hasn't been
updated since the 1920s,

220
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,151
so you can see how badly
this reno is needed.

221
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,829
The first thing I want to do

222
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,241
is probably blow out
these walls down here.

223
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,745
Oh no, no, no, no.

224
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,268
This is a beautiful,
historic home.

225
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,009
You can't just go
blowing out walls.

226
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,793
Well, up until a
few minutes ago,

227
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,447
we weren't doing
anything, were we?

228
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,014
[laughing]

229
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:43,408
Who got coal in his stocking?

230
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,150
You're afraid of me stealing
your spotlight, aren't you?

231
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,780
Grace, no one's going
to steal my spotlight.

232
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,197
Oh, yeah, no one but me.

233
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,851
It's just like old times.

234
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,722
- Old times?
- Mm-hm.

235
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,681
Back when I used to
beat you at everything.

236
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,310
You think you could stop
teasing me long enough

237
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,553
for us to get some work done?

238
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,425
Maybe when it's no longer fun.

239
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,471
It's very mature.

240
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,318
Listen, I've got to be
honest with you, okay?

241
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,083
This house, it needs to be nice.

242
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,216
I'm talking next level here.

243
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,411
And it is my family's house,
so I'm kind of feeling like

244
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,891
you should let me
take the lead on this.

245
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,700
Yeah, but your grandma hired me.

246
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,659
And I heard that. But it
is my family's legacy.

247
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,357
And I was hired to do a
job, and I'm going to do it.

248
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,403
- Grace...
- Okay, listen, Anthony.

249
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,187
Why don't we pick
this up tomorrow?

250
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,861
I'm going to give you
a little bit of time

251
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,147
to get your mind right.

252
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,279
That's the door, right?

253
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,020
I'll be going this way.

254
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,543
[Grace sighs]

255
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
Just like old times.

256
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,418
I mean, she has
this beautiful home

257
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,333
with these historic flourishes

258
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,900
and he just wants
to tear it all down.

259
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,510
Can you believe that?

260
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,555
What I can't believe

261
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,142
is that you didn't introduce
me to Miss Loretta.

262
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,125
- I'm obsessed with her.
- Not now, Alexis.

263
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,127
Anthony really got
under your skin.

264
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,062
Do you know that he doesn't
want to work with me?

265
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,740
And you know, quite frankly,

266
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,326
I'm not sure if I
want to work with him

267
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,525
right now, either.

268
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,222
- He's just so...
- Hot?

269
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,181
- No, he's so...
- Devastatingly handsome?

270
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,444
No, he's...

271
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:03,856
Better than any Christmas
present Santa ever brought you?

272
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,273
Alexis, stop.

273
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,102
This is my dream job, Alexis.

274
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,495
I just want to create a home

275
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:14,412
for this family that is warm
and loving and inviting.

276
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,199
And he just wants to make
it cold and unfeeling.

277
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,201
I think you both
want the same things.

278
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:21,526
You're just going about
it different ways.

279
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,987
I don't know about that.

280
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,642
Try to stick it out. Help
him see your point of view.

281
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,167
Who knows? Maybe you could
learn something from him too.

282
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:32,604
Ha! That would be a miracle.

283
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,607
And what better time for a
miracle than the holidays?

284
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:36,870
Oh, my goodness.

285
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,003
[Alexis laughs]

286
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,571
[jazz music playing]

287
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,120
- ANTHONY: I'm here to pull...
- CHRIS: Okay, I'm pulling.

288
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,886
Can't believe y'all still
haven't decorated this tree yet.

289
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,366
It's kind of hard to do when
the guy who's, you know,

290
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,978
best at untangling
lights is always working.

291
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,067
Chris, you keep this up,

292
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,261
he might never leave
the office again.

293
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,678
Thank you, Mom.

294
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,462
But he is right, you know.

295
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,813
You too?

296
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,573
Anthony, we have not seen
you since Thanksgiving.

297
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,425
You always hold up in
that workplace of yours.

298
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:11,619
Yeah, because I'm trying
to build something great,

299
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,645
like Grandma did.

300
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,778
And I got some new ideas, too.

301
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,172
Yeah, like your
scheme with the shop.

302
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,609
No, that's... that's not
a scheme. That's a plan.

303
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,264
One day that stubborn of a woman
is going to let me do it, too.

304
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:24,961
Look, if we modernized the shop,

305
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,789
gave her some
bells and whistles,

306
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,071
she wouldn't have
to work so hard.

307
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,618
Hey, man, I'm with you.

308
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,074
I would love some new
bells and whistles

309
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,403
at the shop myself.

310
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:33,796
- Thank you.
- Dope, man.

311
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,319
Anthony, you know
your grandmother.

312
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,278
The old ways are the best.

313
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,975
Mm-hm.

314
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,760
But, uh...

315
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,500
it's about that girl,
though, isn't it?

316
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,633
The one grandma hired.

317
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,765
Which girl?

318
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,204
Anthony? What girl?

319
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,814
You got a big mouth.

320
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,598
Mom, I don't have
time for some setup,

321
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,905
I got to focus on this redesign.

322
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,734
Grace is just another architect
that grandma hired, okay?

323
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,302
Let me talk about the shop.
Let's keep it at the shop, okay?

324
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,956
Well, if it's so
important to you,

325
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,479
why don't you show
your grandmother

326
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,009
that you respect
the old traditions?

327
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,004
Meaning?

328
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,354
What if...

329
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,835
What if you made her
pralines from scratch?

330
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,924
[giggling]

331
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,797
- Oh, Grandma's pralines.
- Mm-hm.

332
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,537
- The secret pralines?
- Mm-hm.

333
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,713
The secret recipe
that only Grandma

334
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,604
and one other person at
the shop knows about?

335
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,954
I didn't say it was
going to be easy.

336
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,806
It's not.

337
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,392
But if you want things
to change, it...

338
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,548
It might not be a bad idea

339
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,835
if you show her that you know
where it all started, huh?

340
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,511
Oh, I got to get
to the store. Here.

341
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,861
- Who's working too hard now?
- Only be a minute.

342
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,168
Mom, would you let me
know if Daryl dropped off

343
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,996
that last stack of
pralines, please?

344
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,824
Yeah, folks need to
get those by Christmas.

345
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,149
Yes, they do. Remember what
happened last Christmas?

346
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:47,957
[laughs]

347
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,935
You got 20 bags of pralines
at the store stocked up?

348
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,371
Yeah, and then we had
to go door-to-door

349
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,657
on Christmas Eve.

350
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:53,571
- That hurt that boy.
- [laughs]

351
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,182
You know Daryl, right?

352
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,097

00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,226
- So...
- So, uh...

874
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:55,316
[bell tolling]

875
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:57,405
- Oh, is it that time?
- What? What time?

876
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,668
I, uh... [sighs]

877
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,429
I told Jordan I'd go to
her Christmas pageant.

878
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,237
Oh.

879
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,457
- Would you want to come with me?
- Yeah.

880
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,763
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

881
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,437
I mean, we got to show our
bells off somewhere, right?

882
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,114
Yes, we do.

883
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,483
- [Grace giggling]
- Okay, let's go.

884
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:13,507
Okay, I'll follow you.

885
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,823
[indistinct conversations]

886
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,303
Anthony, you okay? [laughs]

887
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:27,566
- Yeah, why?
- You look nervous.

888
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,003
Dancing and prancing like
one of Santa's reindeer.

889
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,266
So, you got jokes tonight.

890
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:34,921
Well, I could talk about
your bad design aesthetic

891
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,531
if you want me to.

892
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:38,925
Please don't.
You're reminding me

893
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,927
I got to get back and
work on that redesign.

894
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,755
Tonight is about Jordan.

895
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:46,236
She's going to be so
happy that you are here.

896
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,977
- I hope so.
- [laughs]

897
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,892
[both laughing]

898
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:52,982
Is that my grandma?
Who is she with?

899
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:57,552
I don't know, but he is handsome
and she is looking very happy.

900
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,467
- Unbelievable.
- [laughs]

901
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,382
It's only been a day,
she's already got a man.

902
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:04,907
Listen, be nice, okay?

903
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,711
And I'm going to go get
in the hot cocoa line.

904
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,781
You want some?

905
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,019
I think I'll need something
stronger than cocoa.

906
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,043
I'll see what I can do.

907
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:14,917
Oh, thanks.

908
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:19,095
[indistinct conversations]

909
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,489
- Hey.
- Hi.

910
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,538
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

911
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,235
[phone ringing]

912
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,327
Hey, Grace, what's up?

913
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,679
Hey, um, did I catch you at
a bad time? Can you talk?

914
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,202
<i>Are you all right?</i>

915
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,943
Yes, I'm at a Christmas pageant.

916
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,423
<i>With Anthony?</i>

917
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,818
Uh, sounds romantic.
Dish, please.

918
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,734
No, no, no, no. There
is nothing to dish.

919
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:51,258
Right. Lots of architectural
drafting to be done

920
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,303
at a Christmas
pageant, I'm sure.

921
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,480
Okay, just... just...
Just listen, please.

922
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:59,397
So yesterday, I completely
embarrassed myself

923
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,137
in front of his whole family.

924
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:03,313
We're still not seeing eye
to eye on this project,

925
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,751
and for some reason, everyone
is being so nice to me.

926
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:08,362
I don't know. It's just...
It's just this weird feeling,

927
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,364
like I might
actually belong here.

928
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:12,758
<i>And that can't happen</i>

929
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,934
<i>because I'm so close to
getting this Toronto job,</i>

930
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,763
and I haven't felt
like this in so long.

931
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:21,244
Well, first of all, enjoy it.

932
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,247
Second of all, you never know
what everyone is thinking.

933
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,640
I remember...

934
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,425
Alexis, hold on one sec.

935
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:29,296
Actually, let me give
you a call back, okay?

936
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:31,223
But don't you wanna hear
the rest of my speech?

937
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,778
I'll call you later.
All right, bye.

938
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:37,957
Oh.

939
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,135
I give great advice.

940
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:49,969
[indistinct conversations]

941
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,673
Hey. I heard you back here

942
00:40:58,804 --> 00:40:59,326
and thought I'd
come wish you luck.

943
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,589
What's going on?

944
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,680
Did they send you back here
to try to make me go up there?

945
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,770
No, but why don't
you want to sing?

946
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,990
Can I tell you something?

947
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:14,994
And you promise you won't
tell any other grown-ups?

948
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,691
I promise.

949
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,345
Pinky promise.

950
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,436
There's a lot of
people out there.

951
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:25,918
I just wish mom was
here to sing, too.

952
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,007
Can you keep a secret for me?

953
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,010
I completely understand.

954
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,796
Because I feel the same way.

955
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:37,712
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

956
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:43,631
Do you know what makes
you so incredibly special?

957
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,198
What?

958
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:47,113
Even though your mom isn't here,

959
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,205
you have a whole
family of people

960
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,642
who are out in the audience

961
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:58,167
waiting to cheer you
on and loves you.

962
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:00,387
You know what? They don't
care if you forget the words

963
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,041
or if your voice cracks.

964
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:04,217
None of that matters to them.

965
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:06,480
Come on, I'll walk you out.

966
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,787
Oh, you've got this.

967
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:13,226
You got this, you
hear me? [laughs]

968
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:17,578

[bells jingling]

970
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,235
So, where's your colleague?

971
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,606
Shouldn't you be worried
about your boyfriend?

972
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,109
He is not my boyfriend.

973
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:28,894
Not yet.

974
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:32,332
Whoo! [laughs]

975
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,464
- [audience cheering]
- Ladies and gentlemen.

976
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,729
Welcome, everybody, to our
annual Christmas pageant.

977
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,167
I know you're excited to
get into the holiday spirit,

978
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:43,604
so I will go ahead

979
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:47,782
and introduce our first
number sung by Jordan Brown!

980
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:52,047
[cheers and applause]

[whispers] Go.

986
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:29,998
[lowered voice] Me?

987
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:31,609
Please?

988
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,614
Okay.

989
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:47,668
[audience murmuring]

990
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,844
[whispering] I don't
have the words.

991
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,280
It's okay.

992
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,980
Let's do this.

All right, I think I figured
out Grandma's recipe.

1007
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,053
These are the best
ones right here.

1008
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,969
Uh, are you sure?

1009
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,014
Because, listen, I'm still full

1010
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:14,842
from your grandmother's
jambalaya.

1011
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:17,125
- I can really sit this one out...
- Grace, stop making excuses.

1012
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,499
- [groans]
- Eat the praline.

1013
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:20,805
- [sighs]
- Ready?

1014
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:23,721

[munching loudly]

1016
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:33,948
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
That is awful.

1017
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:37,125
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but it is...

1018
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:38,953
The worst thing I ever
tasted in my life.

1019
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,433
I don't know what
I'm doing wrong.

1020
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,435
I mean, what are pralines?

1021
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:43,847
They're sugar, they're
butter, they're...

1022
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:46,439
Apparently, burnt
pecans. [laughs]

1023
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:48,658
- Funny.
- Well, listen,

1024
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:50,573
let's look at the
bright side, okay?

1025
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,967
At least you decided
to be an architect,

1026
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:54,664
and not a candy maker.

1027
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:57,015
- [sarcastically] Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1028
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:59,104
Speaking of which, let's
see what you got here.

1029
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:08,461
- Wait, Grace.
- Yes.

1030
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:10,593
What did you do with my
beautiful house design?

1031
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,944
Okay, look, you are not going
to put concrete finishes

1032
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:15,381
in this house. I'm
not going to allow it.

1033
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:16,904
I don't know.
You're impossible.

1034
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:21,648
Anthony, your grandmother
is a New Orleans icon,

1035
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:25,173
and we have to give her an
iconic New Orleans home.

1036
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,064
Yeah, but this New Orleans
is the 21st century,

1037
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:28,698
not the Dark Ages.

1038
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,265
New Orleans is a
melting pot, right?

1039
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,746
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

1040
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,749
And we have to give
your grandmother a home

1041
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,056
that reflects that melting pot.

1042
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:40,580
A little bit of French,
a little bit of Haitian.

1043
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,584
The warmth of reclaimed
wood with modern metal.

1044
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,673
It's classic meets modern.

1045
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:49,894
- That could work.
- Good.

1046
