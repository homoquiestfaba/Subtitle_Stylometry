00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,944
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>and welcome to Nashville.</i>

2
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,288
<i>In just a few minutes, we'll be preparing</i>
<i>our 4:45 departure for New York City.</i>

3
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,627
Howdy. How you doing?

4
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:53,504
Applications and pencils are on the bar.
Don't steal the pencils.

5
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,906
Hurry it up. Doors close at 4:05.

6
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,935
Anyone not inside at 4:05
doesn't audition.

7
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,571
When I call your name<i>,</i>
I want you to come right up on stage.

8
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,607
And if it's your first time here<i>,</i>
I think you should know...

9
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,475
that if you don't pass<i>,</i>
it just means I don't think you're ready.

10
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,413
So go home and keep on writing<i>,</i>
and come on back again.

11
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,486
- You gonna try for writer's night?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,045
I'm a writer myself.
I had a top 20 hit last year.

13
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,488
Really?

14
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,026
Young writers always hate it
when I tell them that.

15
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,028
Wanna know
what I'm still doing behind a wheel.

16
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,495
I tell them<i>,</i> live for the moment.

17
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,795
But don't ever get a picture of what
it's gonna be like when you finally hit...

18
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,267
'cause you ain't never gonna be
in that picture.

19
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,805
One<i>,</i> two<i>, un, deux, trois.</i>

20
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,341
- This is it.
- This is it?

21
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,576
Remember<i>,</i> no matter what it looks like
on the outside...

22
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,278
- it's what's going on inside that counts.
- Yeah<i>,</i> I guess.

23
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,014
- There you go.
- Thanks.

24
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,851
Hey<i>,</i> what time is it?

25
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,925
- 4:15.
- 4:15.

26
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,018
We have to do something about this.

27
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,858
- You're here with me.
- What?

28
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,830
I had to stop
and change a flat tire for you...

29
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,423
- which is why I'm late.
- Hey<i>,</i> wait a second.

30
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,570
- James<i>,</i> you know the rules. 4:05.
- I know.

31
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,937
I just stopped to fix this girl's flat tire.

32
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,272
- Oh<i>,</i> that was really nice of you.
- Which is why...

33
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,072
You are a regular Good Samaritan<i>,</i>
you are.

34
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,842
Next time<i>,</i> let the cab driver change
his own tire and you get here on time.

35
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,316
You should consider breaking
one of those rules sometimes<i>,</i> Lucy.

36
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:50,322
- It might be liberating<i>,</i> if nothing else.
- Hey<i>,</i> I don't know him.

37
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,517
That whole tire thing<i>,</i> that was his idea.

38
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,526
Look<i>,</i> I just came here
from the bus station.

39
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,893
In fact<i>,</i> all the way from New York<i>,</i>
and I mean<i>,</i> I didn't even<i>...</i>

40
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,455
Look<i>,</i> I know I'm late<i>,</i>
but I really did suffer to get here.

41
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:04,162
- What was your name<i>,</i> honey?
- Miranda Presley. No relation.

42
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,901
Well<i>,</i> Miranda Presley<i>,</i> no relation...

43
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,238
there is nothing you can tell anybody
in this room about suffering.

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,801
There's another audition next week.

45
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,084
Hey!

46
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,993
You know<i>,</i> I don't appreciate
you including me in your lie back there.

47
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,259
Especially without asking me.

48
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,468
Well<i>,</i> that's a fine point to make.

49
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,468
Thank you.

50
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,398
Okay.

51
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,000
There might be a song in that.

52
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,410
I was gonna ask you out for a beer...

53
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,718
but I've since changed my mind.

54
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,318
What is that<i>,</i> some kind of line?

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,148
Yes.

56
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,325
Does it work?

57
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,085
Sometimes. Rarely.

58
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,859
I'll bet.

59
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,261
I might change my mind again.

60
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,660
Maybe you should change your line.

61
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,279
- That'll be $20.
- I'll pay for the whole week.

62
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,583
That won't work.

63
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,492
Well<i>,</i> the strip is shot. The card is good.

64
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,030
You can call it in if you want.

65
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,794
No need for that. You said it was good.

66
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,928
Never did cotton to the idea
of trusting a machine over a person.

67
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,498
You've got an honest face<i>,</i> Miranda.

68
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,337
Have I got a room for you.

69
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,883
Come on in<i>,</i> sweetie.
Sit wherever you want.

70
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,291
- I'll be right with you.
- Thanks.

71
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,993
Applications<i>,</i> pencils are on the bar.

72
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,638
Don't steal the pencils.

73
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,014
Okay<i>,</i> next.

74
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,818
- Linda Lue Linden?
- That's me. Hi.

75
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,223
Is that really your name<i>,</i> honey?

76
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,293
I'm afraid so. Yeah.

77
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,493
Hey<i>,</i> my name is Linda Lue Linden.

78
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,196
And I'm from Briar Hill<i>,</i> Alabama...

79
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,867
and I just wrote this one<i>,</i> and it's called
<i>Heaven Knocked On My Door.</i>

80
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:23,275
<i>I had a dream last night</i>
<i>and there you were</i>

81
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,881
<i>Standin' at my bed</i>

82
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,579
Can I start over?

83
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,889
<i>I had a dream last night</i>
<i>and there you were</i>

84
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,763
<i>Standin' by my bedside</i>

85
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,096
<i>Devil in angel's clothin'</i>

86
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,103
<i>Talkin' about your crazy ride</i>

87
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,698
<i>I didn't know what to say at first</i>

88
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,971
<i>I couldn't get by those wings</i>

89
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,377
<i>Now here I am in the middle of the night</i>

90
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,243
<i>Talkin' to you about somethin'</i>

91
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,310
- Miranda Presley?
- Yeah.

92
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,028
Hi. My name is Miranda Presley.

93
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm from New York City<i>,</i>
and this song is called <i>Big Bar Hair.</i>

94
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,532
<i>You can see it in the shopping malls</i>

95
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,073
<i>Five-foot girls, six feet tall</i>

96
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,742
<i>Four-inch heels, fake fingernails</i>

97
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,147
<i>She's checkin' out all the sales</i>

98
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,153
<i>You could see it from a distance</i>
<i>She's a good ol' girl</i>

99
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,954
<i>She's gettin' ready to take on the world</i>

100
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,961
<i>Gonna torture my hair</i>
<i>Gonna burn it blond</i>

101
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,725
<i>Gonna tease it beyond repair</i>

102
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,368
<i>Gonna camouflage the brains in there</i>

103
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,567
<i>Gettin' my own big bar hair</i>

104
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,075
<i>Yeah, I'm gettin' my own</i>

105
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,739
<i>Big bar hair</i>

106
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,277
All right. Kyle Davidson.

107
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,083
Hello. I'm Kyle Davidson.
I'm from Connecticut.

108
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,720
This<i>...</i>

109
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,026
I'm a little nervous<i>,</i>
but it really doesn't show.

110
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,326
It's called <i>I Can't Understand.</i>

111
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,299
<i>If you could read my mind</i>

112
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,262
<i>You'd know how hard I tried</i>

113
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,107
<i>But losing was not my plan</i>

114
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,837
<i>And I can't understand</i>

115
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,776
<i>With all those tears I cried</i>

116
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,448
<i>I should have realized</i>

117
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,683
<i>That I'd never hold you again</i>

118
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,093
<i>And I can't understand</i>

119
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,559
<i>I can't understand</i>

120
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:02,198
<i>Why you left my love behind</i>

121
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,810
<i>I can't understand</i>

122
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,680
<i>But I'll love you till the end of time</i>

123
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,809
<i>I search my memory</i>

124
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,980
All right. James Wright.

125
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,752
Oh<i>,</i> I'm so nervous<i>,</i> I can hardly stand.

126
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,185
You ought to be.

127
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,697
I already sold this song and I<i>...</i>

128
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,599
I wrote it for a woman to sing<i>,</i>
but what the hell.

129
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:43,372
<i>You got a thing or two</i>
<i>to learn about me, baby</i>

130
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:49,349
<i>'Cause I ain't takin' it no more</i>
<i>and I don't mean maybe</i>

131
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,350
<i>You don't know right from wrong</i>

132
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,223
<i>The love we had is gone</i>

133
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,696
- <i>So blame it on your lyin', cheatin'</i>
- <i>So blame it on your lyin', cheatin'</i>

134
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,255
- <i>Cold, deadbeatin'</i>
- <i>Cold, deadbeatin'</i>

135
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,597
- <i>Two-timin', double dealin'</i>
- <i>Two-timin', double dealin'</i>

136
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,196
- <i>Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart</i>
- <i>Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart</i>

137
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:14,077
<i>Well, all I wanted</i>
<i>was to be your one and only</i>

138
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:20,074
<i>But all I ever got from you</i>
<i>was being lonely</i>

139
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,859
<i>Now that is laid to rest</i>
<i>'Cause you have failed the test</i>

140
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,987
<i>Hey, blame it on your lyin', cheatin',</i>
<i>cold, deadbeatin'</i>

141
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,496
All right<i>,</i> man.

142
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,999
Okay. If I call your name...

143
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,161
it means you're playing here
Saturday night.

144
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,137
Be here before 7:00.

145
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,606
Nancy Butterworth<i>,</i> Nick Barrett...

146
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,271
Tom Mortenson<i>,</i> Janet Hogan...

147
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,378
James Wright and Ross Miller.

148
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,680
And thank you all for coming.

149
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,665
Miss Miranda<i>,</i>
come over here a second.

150
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,636
We're just congregating.

151
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,066
Congratulations.

152
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,368
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Hey<i>,</i> Kyle Davidson.

153
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,507
- Hey<i>,</i> Linda Lue<i>,</i> is that your face I see?
- Well<i>,</i> it ain't nobody's butt.

154
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,381
- Your song was pretty tonight.
- Oh<i>,</i> it was pretty bad.

155
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,318
So<i>,</i> what did you want?

156
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,149
What?

157
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,585
I was just looking at you up close.

158
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,591
- Yeah<i>,</i> there was something...
- But you changed your mind?

159
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,264
Exactly.

160
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,198
Oh<i>,</i> hey<i>,</i> I liked your song.

161
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,868
Thanks.

162
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,204
- I'm Kyle.
- I liked your song.

163
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,206
Hi. Miranda. I liked yours<i>,</i> too.

164
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,011
- Really?
- Yeah.

165
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,951
<i>So when we meet as friends</i>
<i>My heart will break again</i>

166
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,659
<i>If that's how the story ends</i>

167
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,726
<i>Then I can't understand</i>

168
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,463
- Wow.
- Yeah.

169
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,798
Was that exactly Kyle's song<i>,</i>
because I hardly even recognize it.

170
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,362
Yeah<i>,</i> that was<i>...</i> That was it exactly.

171
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,432
You got a great ear.
You got that from hearing me sing it?

172
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,877
Well<i>,</i> I don't know if the term "sing"
really applies.

173
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,613
Man<i>,</i> they build you up
and then they just tear you down.

174
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,154
Like they all got
the same instruction manual.

175
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,280
- Miranda.
- I'm Linda Lue.

176
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,756
- Nice to meet you.
- You<i>,</i> too.

177
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,793
I really thought
your song back there was great.

178
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,487
...l'd be interested to find out.

179
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,497
Do you ladies have any desire
to accompany Mr. Wright and me...

180
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,294
on an excursion into history?

181
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,131
- And where might you be going?
- Little midnight ride<i>,</i> maybe.

182
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:56,163
'Cause Connecticut Yankee Kyle
wants to write a cowboy song.

183
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,677
- That's right<i>,</i> ma'am.
- Well<i>,</i> you want to go?

184
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,438
Yeah.

185
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,715
All rightie<i>,</i> then. Let's go<i>,</i> little doogies.

186
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,251
- Dogies.
- Doogies.

187
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,980
Dogies. Come on.

188
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,085
Hey<i>,</i> look at this guy.
He's smiling for us.

189
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,023
That's no smile. That's contempt.

190
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,457
I had a third cousin
who used to be a rodeo clown.

191
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,895
Funny thing is<i>,</i>
he broke his neck and he died.

192
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,594
Well<i>,</i> don't worry about me.
I took riding at summer camp.

193
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,696
Yeah.
The dude ranch in what? New England?

194
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,674
Hey<i>,</i> hey<i>,</i> what do you know? Whoa!

195
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,044
Kyle Davidson<i>,</i>
you are a sight to behold!

196
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,671
Ride them<i>,</i> cowboy!

197
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,016
The old gray mare<i>,</i>
she ain't what she used to be many...

198
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,490
- Look at me<i>,</i> look at me.
- What?

199
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,856
- In the eyes.
- Okay<i>,</i> okay.

200
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,622
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- A couple.

201
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,687
- How many fingers?
- Four or five<i>,</i> yeah.

202
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,824
- How many Beatles were there?
- Three<i>,</i> and Ringo.

203
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,266
- You okay? You okay?
- Yes.

204
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,564
Oh<i>,</i> he's just fucking with me.

205
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,606
- I'm just one hell of a country boy.
- Just a minor concussion<i>,</i> that's all.

206
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,868
Linda<i>,</i> please get the truck<i>,</i>
and I gotta secure the horses<i>,</i> here.

207
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,035
- Make sure he doesn't fall asleep.
- Oh<i>,</i> my God.

208
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,477
- Gotta keep him awake and conscious.
- Yes<i>,</i> I'm fine.

209
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,210
Kyle<i>,</i> we have some work on this fence
to do for Mr. Wilson tomorrow.

210
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,047
- You all right<i>,</i> honey?
- Oh<i>,</i> honey.

211
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,986
You know<i>,</i> there's this tradition
when you first get to Nashville...

212
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,717
where you have to go
to the tallest mountain...

213
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,191
or the top of a building<i>,</i>
and throw your head back...

214
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,286
and yell as loud as you can<i>,</i>
"Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

215
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,058
"'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving."

216
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,291
- You got that?
- Got that.

217
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,834
- That's real nice. Okay.
- Don't forget it.

218
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:34,305
I wasn't sure that song was any good
until I heard you sing it tonight.

219
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,399
- Oh<i>,</i> Kyle<i>,</i> it's a beautiful song.
- Great<i>,</i> will you do the demo for me...

220
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,738
because I don't have anybody else.

221
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,801
I don't have any money
and I can't pay you or anything.

222
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,642
- I got the car. Put on your hat.
- Okay. Yeah<i>,</i> sure.

223
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,375
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah<i>,</i> put your arm around there.

224
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,246
- Put your arm around my head.
- All right.

225
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,479
Now<i>,</i> honey<i>,</i>
I told you before<i>,</i> he's perfectly fine...

226
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,616
- but we just can't release him.
- Look<i>,</i> could we at least go back...

227
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,523
- and just talk to him?
- Honey<i>,</i> can't you try to relax...

228
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,222
and I'll let you know. He's just fine.

229
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,570
So<i>,</i> where you been staying?

230
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,380
- You know that motel near the Bluebird?
- The Drake?

231
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,179
- Yeah.
- Unreal. That's where I'm staying.

232
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,580
What room did you get?

233
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,551
- Room 108.
- Oh<i>,</i> my God<i>,</i> the dreadful disco room.

234
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,594
Yeah<i>,</i> I kind of like it.

235
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,096
Yeah<i>,</i> you should see mine.
It is so great.

236
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,396
It's all done up and everything.
It's just<i>,</i> I mean<i>,</i> it looks super.

237
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,663
You should come over
and see it sometime.

238
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,672
- Maybe.
- You know what?

239
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,866
I'm getting an idea...

240
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,138
that since we're both at the same motel<i>,</i>
why don't we just...

241
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,942
go ahead and share my room
and then we can save some money.

242
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,879
You just met me.
I mean<i>,</i> you don't even know me.

243
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,283
Oh<i>,</i> please.
I'm an excellent judge of character.

244
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,879
I have a touch of the power<i>,</i> you know.
I truly do.

245
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,754
Daddy<i>,</i> look at me. Are you okay?
You'll be fine.

246
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,453
Johnson<i>,</i> Room 10.

247
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,430
Ma'am<i>,</i> excuse me<i>,</i> are you the doctor?
Can I come in there?

248
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,362
- You can't come in.
- Daddy<i>,</i> I'll be right here! I'll wait.

249
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,491
- Just go. Just wait.
- Okay.

250
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,308
<i>The more I hurt</i>

251
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,846
<i>The less I feel</i>

252
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,713
<i>The more I know</i>

253
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,020
<i>The less I rest in this</i>

254
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,229
<i>Lone star</i>

255
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,962
<i>State of mine</i>

256
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:47,698
- Did you write that yourself?
- Yeah<i>,</i> just now. For you.

257
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,311
You see<i>,</i> to be honest...

258
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,212
I'm not particularly fond
of hospitals myself.

259
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,149
The truth is...

260
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,725
my dad went into an emergency room
and I never saw him again.

261
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,697
- That's him.
- Well<i>,</i> he looks just like Elvis.

262
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,802
He's the other one
who doesn't look like Elvis.

263
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,713
He gave this to me when I was 10.

264
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,711
My "decitennial accolade<i>,</i>" he called it.

265
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,614
He had a name for everything.

266
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,248
He raised me since I was 5.
Just me and him.

267
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,223
So<i>,</i> where was your mom
through all this?

268
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,497
She split...

269
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,427
pretty early on.

270
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,596
Presley's my middle name.

271
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,437
He had this thing<i>,</i> my dad<i>,</i> about Elvis.

272
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,501
Nothing weird.

273
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,281
He always wanted to take me
to Graceland...

274
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,419
but we never made it.

275
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,922
Come on.
There's something I want to do.

276
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,226
Where we going<i>,</i> baby?

277
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:23,628
Now<i>,</i> don't do it just 'cause Kyle<i>,</i>
that pseudo-hick Kyle<i>,</i> told you to.

278
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,567
Hey<i>,</i> it's a grand old Nashville tradition.

279
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,730
Well<i>,</i> you can bet
he tells that to all the girls...

280
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,205
who get off the Greyhound bus.

281
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,300
Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i>
traditions have to start somewhere.

282
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,140
Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

283
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,305
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!

284
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,246
This is terrible. I cannot watch this.

285
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,079
Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

286
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:43,383
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!

287
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,519
It's just so desperate.

288
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,656
Well<i>,</i> is this all beneath you<i>,</i>
Mr. Cool Guy?

289
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,855
It's not that I can't do it.

290
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,557
- In fact<i>,</i> I could do it better than most.
- Oh<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> then.

291
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,328
Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

292
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,633
'cause here I am
and I ain't never leaving. There.

293
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,196
Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

294
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,972
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!

295
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,811
Look out<i>,</i> Music City<i>,</i> 'cause here I am
and I ain't never leaving!

296
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,941
Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

297
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,213
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!

298
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,515
Look out<i>,</i> Music City...

299
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,079
'cause here I am
and I ain't never leaving!

300
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,888
- Nice view<i>,</i> isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

301
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,258
- I like it up here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

302
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,198
Hey<i>,</i> that's not nice.

303
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,359
I'm sorry. He's usually not like that.

304
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,165
Okay<i>,</i> he's a little jealous. Come on in.

305
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,367
Well<i>,</i> excuse me. This is it.

306
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,470
This is my <i>casa.</i>

307
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,813
If you need anything<i>,</i>
you just help yourself.

308
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:43,905
Take either bed.

309
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,348
I've been using this one right here<i>,</i>
but that one's good.

310
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,581
All right. Hey<i>,</i> Buster.

311
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,986
- Oh<i>,</i> his name ain't Buster.
- What's his name?

312
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,524
It's Mr. Dog.

313
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,783
Well<i>,</i> how do you know
his first name isn't Buster?

314
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,556
Well<i>,</i> because he would have told me...

315
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,359
because we discuss
practically everything<i>,</i> don't we?

316
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,297
I think that's for me.

317
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,863
Hello?

318
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,300
Hey<i>,</i> Ma.

319
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,871
No<i>,</i> I just got in this second.

320
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:17,272
Yeah<i>,</i> yeah. No<i>,</i> everything's fine.
Everything's great.

321
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,546
Yeah<i>,</i> as a matter of fact<i>,</i>
I passed my audition.

322
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,222
Yeah<i>,</i> well...

323
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,451
I was waiting for you
to take a breath<i>,</i> Mama...

324
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,960
so I could get a word in edgewise.

325
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,358
Yeah<i>,</i> they said<i>,</i> just like Loretta Lynn.

326
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,462
Where are you going?

327
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,796
I'm just going to the coffee shop
across the street.

328
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,064
Don't wait up.

329
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,935
<i>I sent you two money orders.</i>

330
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,237
<i>Linda Lue, are you listening to me?</i>
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

331
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,277
No<i>,</i> I'm listening<i>,</i> Mama.

332
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,337
Oh<i>,</i> thanks.

333
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,608
You know<i>,</i>
this stuff is keeping you awake.

334
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:55,051
- That's the general idea.
- Well<i>,</i> what you need is sleep<i>,</i> honey.

335
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:14,200
Hey. I was just wondering
if I gave you the spare room key.

336
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,296
Yeah<i>,</i> you did.

337
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,808
Your pajamas have feet?

338
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,074
Oh<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i>
I unpacked some of your stuff for you.

339
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,979
I put your T-shirts
in the second drawer...

340
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,546
your underthings<i>,</i>
I put those in the top drawer...

341
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,922
and pretty much everything else
I put in the closet...

342
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,223
left to right<i>,</i> light to dark.

343
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,190
- You have a lot of black.
- Okay<i>,</i> great.

344
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:46,069
See<i>,</i> I can't even wear black.
It just completely washes me out.

345
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:53,167
- You ain't mad at me<i>,</i> are you?
- No. No. I just<i>...</i>

346
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,405
I came here to be alone<i>,</i>
so I could get some work done.

347
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,174
So it's nothing personal. I just<i>...</i>

348
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,383
Oh<i>,</i> oh. Well<i>,</i> I'm sorry.

349
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,825
You know<i>,</i>
sometimes people aren't exactly...

350
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,889
the person you might think they are
when you first meet someone.

351
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,793
Well<i>,</i> if it ain't
little miss "getting my own big bar hair."

352
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,229
Yeah<i>,</i> I'm working on that line.
Is Lucy around?

353
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,459
You must be here
to see about the waitress job.

354
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,332
Oh<i>,</i> no. I'm not a waitress. I'm a writer.

355
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,895
Well<i>,</i> it's getting where
I can't tell the difference anymore.

356
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,272
- Hey<i>,</i> Lucy<i>,</i> come on out here.
- Okay. Just a minute<i>,</i> I'm coming.

357
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,709
- You can call me Floyd.
- Hi. Miranda.

358
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,872
I kind of help run this place.

359
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,883
Well<i>,</i> Miranda Presley "no relation."
What can I do for you<i>,</i> hon?

360
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,919
She's here to see about Darcy's job.

361
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,046
You know<i>,</i>
Darcy quit when she got a job...

362
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,558
with Rodney Crowell singing backup.
She met him right here in this club.

363
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,220
Yeah<i>,</i> slipped him a tape<i>,</i>
which is against the rules.

364
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,786
Well<i>,</i> I am here to see you<i>,</i> Lucy<i>,</i>
if you have a minute.

365
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,126
Sure.

366
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,498
Floyd<i>,</i> I'm gonna need that fryer working
by tonight<i>,</i> now.

367
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,732
- Have I ever let you down?
- Repeatedly.

368
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,972
I wanted to ask you about my audition.

369
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,410
You want to know what I thought
was wrong with your song?

370
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,972
Or what you liked about it.
That would be okay<i>,</i> too<i>,</i> right now.

371
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,577
Well<i>,</i>
I thought your melody was real nice.

372
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,181
You're a good performer<i>,</i> hon.
You looked right at home on stage.

373
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,016
But?

374
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,358
Well<i>,</i> your song is a novelty song...

375
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,887
and maybe you need
to dig in a little deeper.

376
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,191
Let me show you something.

377
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,500
You know what's in here?

378
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,701
These are all really great songs
that were sung here first.

379
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,768
They're not all hits<i>,</i>
but they're really special songs.

380
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,111
Some of them took 10 minutes<i>,</i>
some of them took 10 years.

381
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,151
But every one of these writers
found a way to say something...

382
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,744
that meant something to them.

383
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,723
You know<i>,</i> country music tries its best
to be honest with itself...

384
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,888
and when it's sad<i>,</i> it says it's sad.

385
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,061
Okay. Thanks<i>,</i> Lucy.

386
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,439
Listen<i>,</i> Miranda<i>,</i> I know you're not
interested in this waitress job...

387
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,567
but if you change your mind<i>,</i>
the hours are 4:00 to closing.

388
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,271
And no passing tapes to the customers.

389
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,984
Excuse me.

390
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,688
Did I thank you for bringing glamour
and excitement into my dreary life?

391
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,988
I need a light<i>,</i> not a draft. Look at this.

392
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,290
This guy wants me to strip
at his office party.

393
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,558
Don't do it<i>,</i> darling.
This label's going bankrupt.

394
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,122
Well<i>,</i> that's a good reason for it.

395
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,293
This song is called
<i>Lone Star State of Mine.</i>

396
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,666
Hey<i>,</i> hon.

397
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,162
<i>The more I hurt</i>

398
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,367
<i>The less I feel</i>

399
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,036
<i>The more I know</i>

400
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,637
<i>The less I rest in this</i>

401
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:22,049
<i>Lone star state of mine</i>

402
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,123
<i>The more I hurt</i>

403
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,661
<i>The less I feel</i>

404
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,821
<i>The more I know</i>

405
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,128
<i>The less I rest in this</i>

406
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:41,036
<i>Lone star state of mine</i>

407
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,706
<i>Say it straight, don't bend my ear</i>

408
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,906
<i>When I'm walking lost</i>
<i>in an evening air</i>

409
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,508
<i>You two-step into my</i>

410
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,053
I need a Bud<i>,</i> too.

411
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,452
<i>Idle home</i>

412
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,919
<i>And tearing my song all up</i>
<i>with minor chords now</i>

413
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,828
<i>The more I solve, the less I work</i>

414
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,892
<i>That can't be good</i>
<i>for some boy out of love</i>

415
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,374
<i>Out of touch, out of lust,</i>
<i>out of soul, n'out of song</i>

416
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,306
<i>The more I hurt</i>

417
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,078
<i>The less I feel</i>

418
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:31,554
<i>Should I say more or less to get real?</i>

419
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,091
<i>The more I hurt</i>

420
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,389
<i>The less I dream on</i>

421
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,942
- Hey.
- Hey.

422
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,817
- You play a mean cello.
- Thanks.

423
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,288
It's just a big mandolin<i>,</i> really.

424
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,059
How do you like Nashville so far?

425
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,664
I'm writing a song
about a waitress who kills herself.

426
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,026
- Yeah<i>,</i> it's tough.
- Yeah.

427
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,501
But that's why when I first came here
I went to the roof...

428
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,004
and I told the whole damn town
that I don't plan to leave.

429
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,973
- You really did that?
- Yeah.

430
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,636
- I did<i>,</i> too.
- Yeah<i>,</i> I know. I heard you.

431
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,611
The whole hospital heard you.

432
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,875
In fact<i>,</i>
that's my favorite thing about you so far.

433
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,075
Yeah?

434
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,144
Well<i>,</i> I'm gonna<i>...</i>

435
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,025
You know<i>,</i> James<i>,</i>
trust is like an ice cube.

436
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,789
Once it melts<i>,</i> it's gone.

437
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,228
So<i>,</i> in that regard<i>,</i>
I've heard some things.

438
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,129
Oh<i>,</i> you're speaking
of the R.C. Roberts thing.

439
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,191
Well<i>,</i> we had our troubles.
He wanted me to sound like...

440
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,601
- all that top 20 crossover shit.
- I heard you knocked him out.

441
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,639
Yes<i>,</i> I knocked him<i>...</i>
No<i>,</i> I didn't knock him out.

442
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,334
I hit him. I clocked him good<i>,</i> you know.

443
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,137
Did you sign a contract
with R.C. Roberts?

444
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,268
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

445
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,403
No.

446
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,879
You know<i>,</i> I would have passed on Elvis
if he hit somebody.

447
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,745
You know why? 'Cause I can.

448
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,146
- Yeah. Well<i>,</i> that's good.
- Now<i>,</i> it's not that I'm disinterested.

449
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,917
Understood?

450
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,151
- You're James<i>,</i> right?
- Yes<i>,</i> ma'am.

451
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,819
Well<i>,</i> this A and R guy had to leave
while you were still on...

452
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,328
but he wants you to call him
first thing tomorrow.

453
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,661
Well<i>,</i> thank you<i>,</i> dear.
Listen<i>,</i> you've heard my music...

454
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,167
you know what it's all about.
If you have any interest at all...

455
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,032
- please feel free to call.
- Why would I not be...

456
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,731
You got my number.
You can get it from Lucy.

457
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,263
Well<i>,</i> now<i>,</i> I am interested<i>,</i> yes.

458
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,674
Very interested.
I'll call you first thing tomorrow.

459
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,737
First thing. Got it?
Doug Siskin<i>,</i> first thing.

460
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,948
Thank you. Thank you so much.
We work well together.

461
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,111
- Forget about it<i>,</i> baby.
- I'm not gonna forget about it.

462
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,644
- In fact<i>,</i> I owe you.
- Well<i>,</i> if you really mean that...

463
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,816
- I know what I want.
- What's that?

464
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,918
- How about we write a song together?
- Okay.

465
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,854
Well<i>,</i> let's go to the movies<i>,</i> then.

466
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,125
- The movies?
- Yeah.

467
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,600
- I don't wanna go to the movies.
- Come on<i>,</i> baby.

468
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,569
I told you
I want to write a song together.

469
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,466
So<i>,</i> what's this movie about?

470
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,976
It's the oldest story in the book.
Two guys and a girl.

471
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,310
John Wayne and James Stewart
and Vera Miles.

472
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,516
What happens?

473
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,442
Well<i>,</i> let's see.

474
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,879
<i>OI' John and Jimmy</i>

475
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,647
<i>They both loved Miss Vera</i>

476
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:27,021
<i>Now, you know, in time</i>
<i>Something's bound to go wrong</i>

477
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,128
<i>They love the same girl</i>

478
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,732
<i>She's undecided</i>

479
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,809
<i>Looks like Johnny and Jimmy will fight</i>

480
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,674
<i>Before long</i>

481
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,288
<i>The world goes around</i>
<i>and we're on it, regardless</i>

482
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,783
<i>Sometimes it's warm</i>

483
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,123
<i>Sometimes cold and heartless</i>

484
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,291
Yes.

485
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,537
<i>We all have something</i>

486
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,701
<i>That we're in search of</i>

487
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,607
<i>Dream comin' true</i>

488
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:23,183
<i>Life full of love</i>

489
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,812
- That's damn good.
- No.

490
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,379
No<i>,</i> it's good.

491
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,420
All right<i>,</i> it's good.

492
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,096
That door sometimes sticks.

493
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,939
Here<i>,</i> let me help you with that.

494
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,682
I should call you sometime.

495
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,855
Yeah<i>,</i> you should.

496
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,259
Good night<i>,</i> moody.

497
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,983
- Lue<i>,</i> wake up.
- I'm awake.

498
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,549
- There's a man outside the room.
- Oh<i>,</i> it's probably Billy.

499
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,891
- Who's Billy?
- We had a date.

500
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,262
He's not real bright<i>,</i>
but he plays real good guitar.

501
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,696
Yup<i>,</i> that's Billy.

502
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,403
Doesn't Billy have a home?

503
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,033
Yeah. Well<i>,</i> it's just<i>,</i>
when he dropped me off tonight...

504
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,202
I told him I wasn't gonna sleep with him.

505
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,542
Because basically<i>,</i>
I've decided that the road to love...

506
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,550
is just a one-way street<i>,</i>
and sex ain't nothing but a road block.

507
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,178
So he says that he'll just sleep out there
to be near me...

508
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,449
and I said<i>,</i> "Go ahead<i>,</i>
sleep out there on the cold cement...

509
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,013
"catch a cold<i>,</i> I don't care."
And he ended up doing that anyway.

510
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,684
Isn't that nice?

511
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,291
Oh<i>,</i> speaking of nice<i>,</i>
look what else he gave me.

512
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,094
- What's that?
- This.

513
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,694
Miss Nashville pageant.

514
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,672
There's prizes and scholarships
and the finalist gets to go...

515
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,266
to the Miss Tennessee pageant
in Jackson.

516
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,105
What do you think?

517
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,079
I think I don't want to be Miss Nashville.

518
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,115
Of course
you don't want to be Miss Nashville.

519
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,379
You already know
what you want to do with your life.

520
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,943
You're lucky.

521
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,483
So what did you end up doing tonight?

522
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,459
I went out with James.

523
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,693
Really? How'd that turn out?

524
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,597
- It was interesting.
- Interesting<i>,</i> huh?

525
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,633
So<i>,</i> you gonna end up
staying up all night...

526
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,233
in that stupid diner writing songs?

527
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,644
Miranda?

528
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,676
Yeah.

529
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,061
Hey.

530
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:01,997
Hey.

531
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,210
I'm working on a song about insomnia.

532
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,009
What's your excuse?

533
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,252
- Breakfast?
- Dessert.

534
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,220
I've managed to get studio time
tomorrow at 2:30.

535
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,126
- A.m.?
- Yeah.

536
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,993
- Great.
- Good.

537
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,554
- Good<i>,</i> I'll pick you up.
- All right.

538
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,663
Why didn't you call?

539
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,664
- When?
- Now.

540
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,764
About singing on the demo.

541
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,810
I wanted to see you again.

542
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,125
Okay.

543
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,068
- Good night.
- Good morning.

544
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,404
I'm gonna go write
some more of those good songs.

545
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,206
Yeah<i>,</i> write a good one for me.

546
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,446
I write them about you.

547
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,449
You're gonna need
more marshmallows.

548
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,854
Lue?

549
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,066
Linda Lue?

550
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,395
Oh<i>,</i> Mr. Buster Dog...

551
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,029
the only unfriendly creature
in all of Nashville.

552
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,734
Miss Linda Lue<i>,</i> if you had to change
one thing about the United States...

553
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,538
what would that be?

554
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:52,205
Well<i>,</i> Bob<i>,</i> I just think America is
the most wonderful place in the world.

555
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,349
- You look great.
- Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> you know.

556
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,650
I figure if I win Miss Nashville<i>,</i>
I can finally express my natural talent.

557
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,746
Yeah<i>,</i> sure.

558
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,122
Oh<i>,</i> your boyfriend looks
a little overcooked here.

559
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,286
Oh<i>,</i> God<i>,</i> he's getting scorched.

560
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,189
Honey.

561
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,361
- Should we turn him over?
- Yeah<i>,</i> come on.

562
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,996
You know<i>,</i> Miranda<i>,</i>
you may not know this...

563
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,368
since you're asleep
during most of my waking hours<i>,</i> but...

564
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:19,239
I've been having some serious doubts
about my career as a songwriter.

565
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,470
I mean<i>...</i> Hold him. Lift.

566
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,973
I'll never be as good as you<i>,</i>
and you're not even getting anywhere.

567
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,415
Thanks.

568
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,746
- No<i>,</i> I didn't<i>,</i> you know<i>...</i>
- Yeah<i>,</i> I know.

569
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,351
- You really do look beautiful.
- Really?

570
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,557
Are you sure everything's enough<i>,</i>
like the...

571
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,459
- Oh<i>,</i> oh<i>,</i> it's definitely enough.
- Yeah?

572
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,091
In fact<i>...</i> Yeah<i>,</i> yeah. What did you do?

573
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,692
Follow some beauty queen handbook...

574
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,770
on using all of your makeup
that you own?

575
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,534
- Spit.
- Thank you.

576
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,207
So<i>,</i> has he called yet?

577
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,038
I don't know. Has he called in?

578
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,311
- Spit.
- He will.

579
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,887
I mean<i>,</i> if he doesn't<i>,</i>
he's just a big old doodie-head.

580
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,945
Yeah.

581
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,482
God<i>,</i> your skin is so luminous
underneath all this gunk.

582
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,460
You know<i>,</i> you're my very best friend<i>,</i>
you know that?

583
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,159
That's 'cause you're such a sap<i>,</i> Lue.

584
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,863
Chicken and marshmallows
are completely different.

585
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,573
He's so retarded.

586
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,958
Whoa! I realize it's getting late.

587
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,657
I got an idea pertaining to the ending.

588
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,823
Let's leave out that last chord.
Let's end on the three.

589
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,662
So you're gonna take out
the anticipation?

590
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,065
Take out the anticipation. Exactly.

591
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,001
You wanna leave it hanging
and don't resolve it?

592
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,198
- No resolve.
- Might work. Let's try it.

593
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,570
- Let's give it a shot.
- Let's do it.

594
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:01,008
- Where do you want to take it from?
- Let's do the last three.

595
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,147
<i>One, two, three.</i>

596
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,614
<i>Like a rolling stone</i>

597
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,113
<i>down a lost highway</i>

598
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,052
<i>Like a rolling stone</i>

599
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,351
<i>down a lost highway</i>

600
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,756
<i>It's right here. Bring it down.</i>

601
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,122
- <i>Yeah, man.</i>
- Yeah<i>,</i> man.

602
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,528
- It works.
- I like it.

603
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,588
Yeah.

604
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,825
- Hey<i>,</i> let's wait outside.
- We'll take it from the<i>...</i>

605
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,893
- Okay.
- From the top.

606
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,206
One<i>,</i> two. One<i>,</i> two<i>,</i> three<i>...</i>

607
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,845
I remember the first time
I learned what sarcasm was.

608
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:41,045
My brothers and I
were making model airplanes...

609
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,587
and I spilled a little red bottle of paint.

610
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:49,490
And my brother Sean says<i>,</i>
"Kyle<i>,</i> thank you. Thank you<i>,</i> Kyle."

611
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:55,120
I couldn't figure out what he meant
for the life of me.

612
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,458
Sarcasm was important in my family.

613
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,869
But<i>,</i> see<i>,</i>
that's what's good about country music.

614
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,377
There's no sarcasm in it.
It's just straightforward.

615
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,878
Makes you laugh or cry<i>,</i> that's it.

616
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,709
Oh<i>,</i> I don't know.

617
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,879
I realize
I don't really belong in Nashville...

618
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,485
but that's why I try so hard.

619
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,589
Me<i>,</i> too.

620
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,931
I never considered myself
much of a singer.

621
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,159
Well<i>,</i> you are.

622
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,532
I'm much obliged<i>,</i> Steven.

623
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,199
I owe you what? Twenty minutes?

624
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,736
No. Next time<i>,</i> I go first.

625
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,276
- Is that what it is?
- It's that simple.

626
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,675
- Okay.
- Hi.

627
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,144
Hey. Hey.

628
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,611
What's the story with you and James?

629
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,481
I'd be curious to know myself.

630
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,454
<i>Can't understand</i>

631
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:57,423
<i>why you left my love behind</i>

632
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,122
<i>Can't understand</i>

633
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:07,099
<i>But I'll love you till the end of time</i>

634
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:12,174
<i>I search my memory</i>

635
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,343
- <i>For the reason you don't love me</i>
- <i>For the reason you don't love me</i>

636
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,276
You know
who would be great for this song?

637
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,680
- No.
- Trisha Yearwood.

638
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,582
- And I know her.
- Yeah?

639
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,850
Well<i>,</i> yeah.
I delivered a pizza to her house once.

640
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,425
Well<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i>
you should get this to her.

641
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,426
- Yeah<i>,</i> right.
- Kyle<i>,</i> I'm serious.

642
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,689
This song is better
than most of the stuff on the radio.

643
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,060
Well<i>,</i> you always think that...

644
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,361
when you're the only one
who's ever heard it. Trust me.

645
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,491
Oh<i>,</i> all right.

646
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,128
You know<i>,</i> I just got two words for you<i>,</i>
Kyle Davidson.

647
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,263
- Oh yeah? What?
- No wonder.

648
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,374
No wonder?

649
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,272
No wonder<i>,</i> what?

650
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,078
- What?
- What do you think?

651
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,410
Well<i>,</i> what? I don't know.

652
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,475
What<i>,</i> that I still work in a record store?
Or that I'm just another one...

653
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,783
of those guys that never did
what he said he was gonna do?

654
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,986
I know<i>,</i> I just sit around<i>,</i> I play around
and I never get around...

655
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,085
- to putting my stuff out.
- Kyle<i>,</i> you're very talented.

656
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,993
But it doesn't matter if you're afraid of it.

657
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,464
If you're afraid of the disappointment
all the time.

658
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,763
I gotta do something
to get my songs heard.

659
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,325
You're right.

660
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,335
What do you think I should do?

661
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,071
Come with me.

662
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,946
- Well<i>,</i> I guess I will<i>,</i> then<i>,</i> huh?
- I think you should.

663
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,852
- You sure this is Yearwood's house?
- Yeah.

664
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,251
Yeah.
Pepperoni and mushrooms. I'm sure.

665
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,672
- Wow.
- Don't scratch it.

666
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,581
- Give me the thing.
- The thing?

667
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,846
- The thing.
- The thing?

668
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,945
- The car thing.
- You don't even know what to call it.

669
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,013
I can't believe this.
I thought you'd done this before.

670
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,614
- You think I'm a criminal?
- I don't know.

671
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:09,681
I've seen it done.

672
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,728
I had a boyfriend
who's doing time for this.

673
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,889
- Well<i>,</i> time<i>...</i> How much time?
- Eighteen months.

674
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,398
That's a year and a half. Come on...

675
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,434
- I'm joking. That's a joke.
- That was a bad joke.

676
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,491
Give me the tape.

677
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,128
- Okay.
- Thank you.

678
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,037
- We gotta go. Shit<i>,</i> come on!
- Let me put the tape in.

679
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,472
Take it out! It's got my name on it.

680
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,271
How else is she gonna know
whose song it is?

681
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,744
She's also gonna know
that I'm the one that broke into her car.

682
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:33,180
- That's the one drawback of the plan.
- I can't believe it.

683
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,345
- I'm gonna get the tape.
- Kyle<i>,</i> forget the tape.

684
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,583
- Where's eject?
- Kyle...

685
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,147
Where's eject?

686
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,298
Since when did cops
start responding so fast?

687
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,601
I'm sorry<i>,</i>
there's nothing I can do about it.

688
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,829
Look<i>,</i>
we weren't trying to steal anything.

689
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,531
We were just trying to give her a tape.

690
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,837
Well<i>,</i> in that case<i>,</i>
I'll just have to let you go<i>,</i> won't I?

691
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,072
Don't arrest her. It was my tape.
She just broke into the car for me.

692
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,545
- Thanks.
- Believe it or not...

693
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,049
you two don't get to decide
who we arrest.

694
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,312
<i>She's in love with the boy</i>

695
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,686
<i>She's in love with the boy</i>

696
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,658
<i>And even if they have to run away</i>

697
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,593
<i>She gonna marry that boy someday</i>

698
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,291
Right here is your perpetrators there<i>,</i>
Miss Yearwood.

699
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,802
Hi. I'm Kyle Davidson.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

700
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,029
- Hi.
- Hi.

701
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,372
This is Miranda Presley.

702
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,066
- Hi.
- Hi. Honored.

703
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,970
Well<i>,</i> y'all are really polite
for hardened criminals.

704
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,033
Oh<i>,</i> thanks.

705
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,580
Which one of you
jimmied my car door open?

706
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:42,177
- She wasn't trying to steal it<i>,</i> though.
- Well<i>,</i> thanks for not scratching it.

707
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,585
- Were you the one singing on the tape?
- Yeah. You listened to the tape?

708
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,351
- Yeah.
- It's his song.

709
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,619
I guess this song is available<i>,</i>
or are you waiting...

710
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,662
to hear from everybody else
whose car you broke into?

711
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,064
No<i>,</i> yours was the only car
we broke into.

712
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,158
Oh<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> I'm flattered.

713
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,465
I just wish I wasn't flattered
this late at night.

714
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,562
Is your phone number on the tape?

715
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,199
Well<i>,</i> I'm gonna have my manager
give you a call...

716
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,106
about putting the song on hold.

717
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,805
Miss Yearwood<i>,</i>
do you want to press charges?

718
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,405
Right now<i>,</i>
all I want to do is get some sleep.

719
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,949
Good night.

720
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,043
- That means no.
- Congratulations<i>,</i> son.

721
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,250
Miss Yearwood<i>,</i> excuse me.
Since you're looking for new material<i>...</i>

722
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,993
Go on<i>,</i> Linda Lue<i>,</i> you can make it.
I don't want to miss the dance.

723
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,799
No<i>,</i> wait. Linda<i>,</i> don't<i>,</i> don't.
Wait a second.

724
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,362
That train's gonna be coming on
around the bend any second...

725
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,875
- so let's just hop the freight.
- Excuse me?

726
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,501
- Come on.
- Kyle<i>...</i>

727
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,375
Come on<i>,</i> it's an old country tradition.

728
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,779
Plus<i>,</i> the tracks go right by
the Full Moon Dance<i>,</i> you guys.

729
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,511
You remember what happened last time
you went on a little adventure?

730
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,610
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Are you kidding me?

731
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:51,915
You landed in the hospital.

732
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,150
You're the one
who wants to write country songs.

733
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,852
There's nothing more country
than a freight train.

734
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,292
- Kyle.
- Oh<i>,</i> my God.

735
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,695
- Kyle.
- You're gonna break your fool neck!

736
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,825
Go on. Go on.
I'll meet you at the next crossing there.

737
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,835
You know<i>,</i>
I had a cousin who once threw himself...

738
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,837
in front of a speeding train
in the name of love.

739
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:09,963
Once?

740
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,668
Well<i>,</i> once pretty much did the trick<i>,</i>
Miranda.

741
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,438
I wish you'd stop telling that story.

742
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,776
Why are we letting him
get on that stupid train?

743
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,314
Kyle<i>,</i> come on!

744
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,918
Kyle<i>,</i> listen. I'm serious. Get back here!

745
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,246
- Kyle.
- That ain't funny<i>,</i> Kyle!

746
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:30,054
Kyle<i>,</i> you're gonna get yourself hurt!

747
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,821
Kyle!

748
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:37,396
- Kyle<i>,</i> you're gonna hurt yourself!
- Kyle<i>,</i> let's go!

749
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,129
- Kyle<i>,</i> you're stupid.
- He's so stubborn.

750
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,330
You're so stubborn<i>,</i> Kyle!

751
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,209
- Kyle!
- Kyle!

752
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,344
Careful<i>,</i> y'all.

753
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,450
- Kyle! Kyle!
- Where is he?

754
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,186
Over here.

755
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,924
Hi. I slipped.

756
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,935
Are you sure you're okay?
Kyle<i>,</i> you're all right?

757
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,034
You didn't break anything
other than your pride?

758
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,773
- No<i>,</i> I'm okay<i>,</i> I think.
- You sure do enjoy pain<i>,</i> don't you?

759
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,475
- Well<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i> and heartache.
- Yeah<i>,</i> a little pain and heartache.

760
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,882
- Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> I'm all right.
- Come on<i>,</i> you big jerk.

761
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,944
Do you think this is funny?
This isn't funny.

762
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,780
People that you know<i>,</i> they get killed
and that's it<i>,</i> you know.

763
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,419
You die and you don't come back.
That's it<i>,</i> you know.

764
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,895
- That's not funny.
- What's the matter with her?

765
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,158
Come on<i>,</i> get up.

766
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,998
- Gave her a little scare<i>,</i> that's all.
- I didn't mean to do that.

767
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,542
Come on<i>,</i> y'all.
Let's show them what we got.

768
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,204
Don't show them what you got<i>,</i> Billy<i>,</i>
you might scare someone.

769
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,440
Well<i>,</i> thanks a lot<i>,</i> Linda Lue.

770
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,647
- You're not still mad at me<i>,</i> are you?
- Yes.

771
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,054
- Really?
- No.

772
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,558
- Good<i>,</i> 'cause I'm sorry.
- You should be.

773
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,858
- I got you.
- Thanks.

774
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,680
Come on<i>,</i> you two.

775
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,699
All right.

776
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,840
<i>Thank you, Katie.</i>

777
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,180
<i>All right, everybody.</i>
<i>I want to introduce you...</i>

778
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,479
<i>to a young friend of mine</i>
<i>from my own home state of Texas.</i>

779
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,849
<i>This is James Wright.</i>

780
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,355
<i>He's a singer-song writer. Very good.</i>

781
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,952
- Did you know he was gonna be here?
- I had no idea. I swear.

782
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,588
- <i>Welcome, Jim.</i>
- Jim. I like that.

783
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,757
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

784
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,300
<i>Until now</i>

785
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,234
<i>I've been blind</i>

786
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,975
<i>Until now</i>

787
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:16,277
<i>I've been wastin' time</i>

788
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,914
<i>I've been lost</i>

789
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:24,084
<i>On streets of plenty</i>

790
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:29,761
<i>I've been tossed</i>

791
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,166
<i>On icy seas</i>

792
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,667
<i>And all I've crossed</i>

793
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,637
<i>Ain't worth a quarter</i>

794
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,447
<i>It's muddy water</i>

795
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:52,282
<i>Until now</i>

796
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:56,985
<i>There's a light</i>

797
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,791
<i>That shines forever</i>

798
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,666
<i>There's a light</i>

799
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,801
<i>That shines for me</i>

800
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:14,605
<i>There's a light</i>

801
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,845
<i>My footsteps guiding</i>

802
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,583
<i>For I've been hiding</i>

803
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,316
<i>Until now</i>

804
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,859
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

805
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,670
<i>I wrote this next song</i>
<i>for a woman to sing...</i>

806
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,701
<i>so I guess we best get one up here.</i>

807
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,107
<i>I'd like to invite up here on stage</i>
<i>with us, Miss Miranda Presley.</i>

808
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,715
<i>She only heard this song once.</i>

809
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,482
<i>However,</i>
<i>I happen to know she's a quick study.</i>

810
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,183
<i>She'll pick it right up.</i>

811
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,885
- <i>Dale, you got the lyrics on you?</i>
- Right here.

812
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,818
<i>What say? Let's hit it.</i>

813
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,031
<i>One, two. One, two...</i>

814
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:22,040
<i>You got a thing or two</i>
<i>to learn about me, baby</i>

815
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:28,676
<i>'Cause I ain't takin' it no more</i>
<i>and I don't mean maybe</i>

816
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:32,649
<i>You don't know right from wrong</i>

817
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,555
