1
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,702
You told me you'd be there for me!

2
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:20,108
Calm down, just calm down, calm down!

3
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,821
Tired of blisters on your fingers?

4
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:28,729
Need a helping hand at home?

5
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:30,667
You need Blinky!

6
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,741
Hi, my name's Blinky.

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:35,454
The household robot with a mind of its own.

8
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,630
He's a servant, a helper, and a friend

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,309
Kids are gonna love Blinky and you will too!

10
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:45,228
Blinky is so helpful around the house, it's brought us together and made us closer as a family.

11
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,276
He's my new best friend!

12
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:48,618
He's just like one of the family.

13
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,988
All my friends have one...

14
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,428
Hi honey what's going on?

15
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,455
I know what I want for Christmas.

16
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,321
Hi, my name's Blinky...

17
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:10,005
...and I just want to be your friend.

18
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:12,186
Will you be my friend?

19
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:16,494
It's officially the best Christmas ever.

20
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:18,993
I'll never get sick of him.

21
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,724
<i>Music plays</i>

22
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:30,643
99, 98, 97, 96,

23
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:36,494
95, 94, 93, 92...

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:51,308
<i>Muffled shouting.</i>

25
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:48,138
99, 98, 97, 96,

95, 94, 93, 92, ...

27
00:03:54,473 --> 00:04:00,725
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

28
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:04,889
Ready or not here I come...

29
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,045
I found you.

30
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,179
Yeah, I got bored waiting around.

31
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,680
Would you like to play another game?

32
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:36,202
Sure.

33
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:43,809
999,862

34
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:48,312

36
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:56,848
999,859

37
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,368
<i>Muffled signs of parents arguing in background.</i>

38
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:22,210
999,861

39
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,800
999,860

40
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,289
- 999...
- Stop counting.

41
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,334
No problem.

42
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:33,808
Why did you stop counting?

43
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,798
- I'm sorry, would you like me to continuel?
- Yeah.

44
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,214
And I want you to stay completely still for the next 24 hours.

45
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:41,886
No problem.

46
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:46,138
999,862

47
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:50,530

999,860

49
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:58,743
Clean this!

50
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,916
No problem, I like to clean things.

51
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,905
Why did you move?
I told you not to move.

52
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,989
I told you not to stop counting.

53
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,434
I'm sorry, would you like me to continue?

54
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:12,093
You have to do everything I say, I own you!

55
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,211
No problem.

56
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,195
999...

57
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:19,335
What use are you anyway? All you're good for is cooking and cleaning and playing stupid games!

58
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:23,154
Can you make my parents stop fighting? Can you do that?

59
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,630
No problem.

60
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:30,815
I could tell you to kill everybody, and you'd just stand there blinking like an idiot!

61
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,421
No problem.

62
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:35,549
What does it matter? Go on...

63
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:38,155
Kill my parents, kill me.
- No problem.

64
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,048
- Kill the dog, kill everyone.
- No problem.

65
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:43,825
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...

66
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:51,944
Mom!

67
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,376
No problem, no problem, no problem...

68
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,772
Blinky's broken.

69
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:59,439
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...

70
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:12,663
What did you do to him?

71
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,464
I didn't do anything, I think he's broken or something.

72
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,775
We need to get a new one.

73
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:19,891
Just turn him off and turn him back on again.

74
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:25,418
And if you make another mess like that I'm going to make Blinky clean and cook you for dinner.

75
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,217
I didn't do it, Blinky did it!

76
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,485
Don't start with me, I am not in the mood.

77
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:30,345
Clean it up!

78
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:41,048
No problem, no problem, no problem, no problem...

79
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:49,768
Hi my name's Blinky and I just want to be your friend.

80
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,392
Will you be my friend?

81
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:57,343
Go on, do as you're told.
Clean it up!

82
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,746
Would you like to play another game?

83
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,643
Go away.

84
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:26,651
999,862

85
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:27,622
What?

86
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,167
Get out of my room.

87
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:33,932
Go annoy someone else.

88
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,241
Stop looking at me like that.

89
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,702
What do you want?

90
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,516
I just want to be your friend.

91
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,860
I did what you asked
Did I do good?

92
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,931
I just want to be your friend.

93
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:56,322
Lets be frrrrieeeends...

94
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,115
I don't trust him.

95
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,702
I don't understand you Alex.

96
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,206
Why would he hurt Rosie?
It makes no sense.

97
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,864
I just don't trust him.

98
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,936
Why won't you believe me?

99
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:14,816
Because you're bored with him and you're just trying to make us buy a newer one, that's why.

100
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:19,540
A clear frontrunner has appeared in the so-called robotics race.

101
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,495
Shellcore has announced that its prototype defence unit codenamed Warmachine...

102
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:26,985
...is ready for public testing after several expensive setbacks.

103
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:30,216
...the family
I just want to be your friend.

104
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,430
Would you like to play another game?

105
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:43,432
- Look at the mess you've made
- What?

106
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:45,654
You did this, clean it up!

107
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:47,939
No problem.

108
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,583
...excessive exposure to water...

109
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,895
...make sure Blinky is updated with the latest downloadable firmware updates...

110
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,915
...make sure Blinky is serviced at least once every 2 months...

111
00:09:56,955 --> 00:10:04,229
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1..

112
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:09,191
Ready or not, here I come...

113
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:13,024
Do you like your meatballs?

114
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,601
They're fine, thank you.

115
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,143
Have you seen Alex?

116
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,115
No problem.
Alex is right here.

117
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,799
I recycled him.

118
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,572
I don't understand you  Blinky. 
What do you mean?

119
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,784
I cleaned him and cooked him for dinner.
You're eating him.

120
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:29,587
Did I do good?

121
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:48,796
Shellcore has issued a full product recall and full refund. please call....

122
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:52,846
Ready or not, here I come...

123
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:58,824
Hi, my name's Blinky and I just want to be your friend.
