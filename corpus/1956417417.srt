1
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:25,868
This is a bad address.

2
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:41,168
Did you see that, man?

3
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,470
Damn, boy.

4
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,338
Why do you have to park
this raggedy-ass piece of shit...

5
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:01,988
...in front of us like that, huh?

6
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:05,939
Move.

7
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:09,925
No shit, man.

8
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,879
Where you going, boy?

9
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:13,206
Man, I know that dude from somewhere?

10
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,438
<i>On your knees I say, slave.</i>

11
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,552
<i>Stay.</i>

12
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:28,303
Hey, good looking. Can I help you?

13
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:31,485
I have the wrong number, sorry.

14
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,218
<i>Let's sex and...</i>

15
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,672
<i>Beg more. Beg me. Beg me.</i>

16
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,255
<i>-Yes, yes. You love it.</i>
-Great.

17
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:50,180
<i>You are my slave. Yes, you are my slave.</i>

18
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,642
You like licking my... don't you?

19
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,206
<i>I know. Yes. Come on.</i>

20
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:59,758
I'm gonna get this dude, man.
Come on. Let's go.

21
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,305
<i>Should I begin to...</i>

22
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,329
Hi.

23
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,171
I was just wondering maybe if you know...

24
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:20,018
Thanks.

25
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:25,387
Go ahead.

26
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,128
Hey, Jorge. Wanna play?

27
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,218
Hey, chica. What's happening?

28
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:37,848
Howdy, Jorge.

29
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,461
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:46,639
-Okay, Jorge, you've been a bad boy.
-You are in the wrong address.

31
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,959
You can't just walk into my home.
Where is your warrant?

32
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:02,165
I don't have one. I don't need one.
You skipped on your bail.

33
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,631
-Now, you've been a bad boy.
-That's bullshit.

34
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,218
I know my rights, man.

35
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:28,626
This is none of your business.
This man is a fugitive.

36
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,692
Ain't we all? Unlock him.

37
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,388
Unlock him, motherfucker.

38
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:38,356
Come on!

39
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:40,798
Okay.

40
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:46,985
You do it.

41
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,021
Shit.

42
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,721
You're dead, mister.

43
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:43,582
This is definitely a bad address.

44
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,912
-He's at the roof.
-Come on.

45
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:10,197
Go. Go. Go.

46
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,416
Wait. Let's talk about this, okay?

47
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,245
Is that a no?

48
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:02,047
I'm getting too old for this.

49
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:07,125
Yeah.

50
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:34,947
Shit.

51
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,260
Remember me? Trey. Trey Washington.

52
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,382
I did eight years because of you!

53
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,721
Yeah, I remember you now.

54
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,833
I remember and it should have been 20.

55
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,264
I'm gonna kill you the right way.

56
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:07,686
I'm gonna kill you.

57
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,079
Boy, that's good. That's real good.

58
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:37,146
-Oh, you want the keys.
-I just trying...

59
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:46,974
Be right back, cowboy.

60
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:34,319
Hey, Sonny, my boy. Good to see you.
Come on in. Come on in.

61
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:35,832
How you doing, Murray?

62
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,071
Where's the doughnuts?

63
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:42,417
What do you mean? There's no doughnuts.

64
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,548
Fine.

65
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,946
Here's the docs on Jorge, 
I brought him into county yesterday.

66
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:49,750
Put them down.

67
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:58,144
Everybody puts them on the pile.
They know I'm good for it.

68
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,463
They know I'm gonna get to them.
Except you.

69
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:02,573
You're just like your father.

70
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,925
All right, all right, all right.

71
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,087
Okay, okay. Perfect.

72
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:22,221
One, two, three, four. Four hundred. Okay.

73
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:24,509
You got to sign for it.

74
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:45,980
Excuse me.

75
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:50,037
Sorry. We are looking for Mr McLaine.

76
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,722
It's McLaine. Sonny McLaine.

77
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,548
I am Lazlo, this is my wife, Eva.

78
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,326
Is bad time?

79
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,260
No, what can I do for you?

80
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:06,288
We have restaurant,
"Best Russian food served."

81
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,929
Okay? So?

82
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,451
Our son, Jonish, is wild boy.

83
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:16,542
He always in trouble with the police
ever since we come here.

84
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:19,004
He steal cars. Go to jail.

85
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:23,444
We put up our business for bond,
and he run away.

86
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:27,250
Now we will lose our bond
if he for not come home...

87
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:28,964
...for to face judgment.

88
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:35,819
Look, I'm not a private detective, okay?
I don't work on a direct basis. I'm sorry.

89
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,007
But people in the neighborhood,
our friends from old country,

90
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,622
they told us to come to you.

91
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,546
There's really nothing I can do.
I'm sorry.

92
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:47,608
Please Mr McLaine,
we do not know where else to go.

93
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:51,208
We pay you 20 thousand dollars.
More if you need.

94
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,892
No, no, no. It's not the money, okay?
It's not the money at all.

95
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,930
You are our only hope.

96
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:02,180
If Jonish does not come back home
for to go to court, we lose the bail.

97
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,189
We lose everything we work for.
Everything.

98
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:09,367
Now, we think he go to cabin.
We have in the hills.

99
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:13,279
Map and directions,
here in your hands now.

100
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,750
Look. You should call the police. Okay?
They'll gather him up for you.

101
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:22,136
I'll give you a name
and a person to contact.

102
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,555
Okay? You just tell them
that Sonny McLaine sent you.

103
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,582
He will hurt someone.
Or someone will hurt him.

104
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,726
We think it is better to
stay away from police.

105
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,025
It is for the best.

106
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,332
Half the money now.

107
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,614
Half when Jonish is back.

108
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,612
My wife, she make the Russian dessert
for restaurant,

109
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,751
best Russian you,
for you have ever get eaten.

110
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,459
God bless you.

111
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,642
-I'm home, babe.
<i>-I'm up here!</i>

112
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,555
How's my boy?

113
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,386
No. You mean, how's your little girl?

114
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,287
-Okay. As long as it's healthy.
-It could be a girl.

115
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:33,783
-It could be a girl. I know.
-As long as it's healthy, right?

116
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,465
Hey, Sonny.

117
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,013
When are you gonna learn how to duck?

118
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:42,107
Let me go get some ice. Here. Hold this.

119
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,711
Wait a minute. You missed a spot.

120
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,723
-Where?
-Right here.

121
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:50,581
Oh, that's a good spot.

122
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:54,996
Have you talked to Murray?

123
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,418
No. Not yet.

124
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:58,973
Are you gonna talk to him?

125
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,054
What am I suppose to say?
I have nothing to offer him?

126
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,760
Well, you know
Murray's not getting any younger.

127
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,429
I'm sure
he'd love to have you in the office.

128
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,219
You know the business? You could run it.

129
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:16,318
It's a hell of a lot better
than almost getting killed everyday.

130
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:21,337
Case, I'm a bounty hunter,
just like my father.

131
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:26,712
-I don't know anything about office work.
-Yeah.

132
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,999
-I'm not sure I even wanna.
-Yes, I...

133
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:35,919
You know, all I want, is to be with you.

134
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,791
To be a good mother.

135
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:44,203
And to teach a few computer classes,
you know?

136
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,805
And, that is gonna be
a hell of a lot harder...

137
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,643
...if you go and get yourself killed.

138
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:54,769
I mean, you know, is it too much to ask...

139
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,928
...for you to do something
a little less dangerous?

140
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,842
No. I mean, I don't know.

141
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,583
I don't know.

142
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,595
-I love you, Sonny.
-And I love you too.

143
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:17,002
Nothing is gonna happen. Okay?

144
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,582
Nothing will ever happen.
I won't let that happen to you.

145
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:25,223
I love you.

146
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,870
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, Sonny. Have an apple.

147
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,704
-Thank you. Everything okay now?
-Good. Better now. Thanks. Yeah.

148
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,120
Thanks. Okay. Gotta go.

149
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:03,956
So, how's Lisa?

150
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:09,864
-It's Casey.
-Yeah, I knew that.

151
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:14,000
-She's pregnant.
-Hey, hey, hey.

152
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,005
Hey. Salud.

153
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
To fatherhood.

154
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,785
The best thing any man can do
with his life.

155
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,056
How would you know that?
You don't have any kids, Murray.

156
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:31,746
-I had a father.
-Father.

157
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:48,963
So, he's a big guy?

158
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,299
He's a dump truck with feet, Murray.
Come on.

159
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:52,919
With the brains to match.

160
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:57,908
You're thinking "can I take him?"
Time to change tactics.

161
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,815
You're getting too old to duke it out
with these guys anymore.

162
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,960
You gotta outsmart them.

163
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:07,709
I'm not doing it.
Not for five percent anyway.

164
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:11,896
Ah, five percent? Now we're getting
to the heart of the matter.

165
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,096
Well forget it.
That's all I can pay on this one.

166
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:20,026
Here. Take a look at these.
You can have any job you want. All right?

167
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:30,501
-What?
-What?

168
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:34,535
I mean, you got something on your mind.
Come on. What's bugging you?

169
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,027
Nothing. There's nothing bugging me.

170
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:41,989
Here, Casey made you a salad.
How about that, huh?

171
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:44,622
Salad, shmalad.

172
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:47,118
In the old days we used to go
out for corned beef sandwiches.

173
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:49,645
Eat like gentlemen. Rabbit food.

174
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,330
Rabbit food.

175
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,236
Thank her for me, okay?
She's a wonderful girl.

176
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:57,369
-Bye, Murray.
-You hear me?

177
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:06,898
-Hey, Zeke.
-Hi, Sonny.

178
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:09,456
Here, throw me the ball,
I'll give you a pass.

179
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:14,209
He's going and he's going.

180
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:18,831
-Whoa, you all right?
-Yeah, nice pass.

181
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,798
-Hey, honey.
-Hey, babe.

182
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:29,491
-What's all that?
-Nothing.

183
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:32,418
Well, it doesn't look like nothing to me.

184
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,022
What have you got another case?

185
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:38,578
It is, isn't it?

186
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:43,394
You know, Sonny, you promised me
one more case and that was gonna be it.

187
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,697
It's always the same story with you.
Again and again.

188
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:47,600
Another case. Just one more case.
Just another case.

189
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:49,106
You know, being a bounty hunter...

190
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:51,402
...and having a family
just doesn't mix, honey,

191
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,845
it didn't work for your family
and it's not gonna work for this family.

192
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,704
Because you won't let it.
You won't compromise.

193
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,096
No, I won't compromise.
Not when it comes to our child.

194
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:04,794
You have a family to think about now.
It's different.

195
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:07,274
Well, I like what I'm doing.

196
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:12,862
Honey, you know, your dad died...

197
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:15,832
...doing what you do
when you were 10 years old.

198
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,922
I don't want the same thing
to happen to our child.

199
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,518
Hey. Well, look who's here.

200
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,913
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

201
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,834
As your father used to say,
"None of your damn business."

202
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:42,074
How are you doing, baby?

203
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:48,740
I was just talking with old Jake here.

204
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,083
-You know what Sonny?
-What?

205
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,734
I had the distinct pleasure
of working with this man,

206
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,042
the best fucking cop.

207
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,731
I told you before, Racine.
You try to kiss me...

208
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:08,779
...and I'm going to paste your lips
to another part of your body.

209
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:12,808
That's funny.

210
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:16,573
He did it again. He did.

211
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:20,409
Shit. Oh, shit.

212
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,046
Come on. Come on. Oh, shit.

213
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,914
Come on. Right up there. All right.

214
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,576
Tell me something Jake.

215
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,121
Why does this guy
look so familiar to me anyway?

216
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,204
-I don't know. Never saw him before.
-You never saw him?

217
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:57,538
Then can you do me a favor?
Without getting the cops involved.

218
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,406
Not even Rass, okay?

219
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:09,356
Hey. Okay, okay, okay. All right. So...

220
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:13,407
What else has been happening
in your life, youngster?

221
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,197
Well,
besides constantly fighting with Casey?

222
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,173
Let me guess.

223
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:22,452
She wants you to change your life 
for the baby, right?

224
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:27,646
You don't get married four times
without learning something.

225
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,529
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told your old man...

226
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,563
...when he came to see me 35 years ago,

227
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:38,133
with that same weeping hang dog
expression on his ugly mug.

228
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,238
You're not getting any younger.

229
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:43,406
You're not beautiful, you're not smart,
you're not rich.

230
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:46,262
It's a miracle
Casey sees anything in you she likes.

231
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,798
So, you better do
whatever she wants you to do.

232
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,701
-And thank God she...
-Garcon.

233
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:52,849
Garconette.

234
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:56,322
Give me one more round
for me and my friends.

235
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:58,570
No. That's enough. Thanks.

236
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:01,780
Come on, Rass.

237
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,981
-Jake, Jake. I'm taking him home.
-Yeah.

238
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:07,044
-Rass, you've had enough.
-Wait a minute. I'm having some fun here.

239
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:09,358
Yeah, I know you're having fun...
My toe!

240
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,966
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh!

241
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:24,318
<i>Jake, you got anything
on that Jonish character?</i>

242
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,166
Yeah, his name turned up
in four separate files,

243
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,026
but each one had nothing in it.

244
00:23:29,205 --> 00:23:32,258
<i>-Aw, come on. What do you mean nothing?</i>
-Empty. Zero. Zip.

245
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:36,402
Somebody swiped everything
or deleted everything.

246
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:39,169
Be careful on this one, Sonny.

247
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,621
<i>-Thanks, Jake. I'll be in touch.</i>
-Okay.

248
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,656
-Pizza man.
<i>-Pizza...</i>

249
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,542
-Pizza man.
<i>-What?</i>

250
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,396
Pizza man!

251
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,497
-Hi.
-Who ordered a pizza?

252
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:01,416
I don't know. Ugly guy, long hair.

253
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,414
He said deliver it up here,
and you'd pay me.

254
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:07,277
-Well, what's on it?
-What's on it?

255
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,950
Well, looks like we got some pepperonis,
some little black olives.

256
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:15,631
Any anchovies?

257
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,700
Anchovies? Yeah, looks like
there's some anchovies right there?

258
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:21,079
Double on the cheese, too.

259
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,891
And we got your basic...

260
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:28,731
Nice, huh? Can I come in?

261
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:35,432
-Who sent you to kill me?
-Kill you? Nobody.

262
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:37,742
Your parents want you home, that's all.

263
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:42,300
My parents? My parents are dead.
I buried them both 10 years ago.

264
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,302
Any idea why someone sent
a bounty hunter to collect you?

265
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,088
Oh, P-38, nice.

266
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:49,441
I don't know.

267
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,328
But if you leave, 
maybe you'll live to find out.

268
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:56,839
What's that suppose to mean?

269
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:14,414
"Jonish Kukoc."

270
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:23,747
You damn, pig.

271
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,340
To much pizza. So there, pretty go.

272
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,265
You piece little shit.

273
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,385
Three hundred pounds.

274
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,952
This is a set up.
You're going to get me killed.

275
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,208
Oh, shit.

276
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:20,641
Go to that side.

277
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:25,376
-Who are those guys?
-They're gonna kill us both.

278
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:27,245
Who the hell are they?

279
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,951
Hey, are you listening to me?

280
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,830
They're going to kill me,
and they're going to kill you, asshole!

281
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,534
Will you calm down?

282
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:55,369
-You're dead man.
-Yeah, I do get that feeling.

283
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,664
Now let's find out why.

284
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:11,367
<i>Yeah, Rass, this is Sonny.
Can you do me a favor.</i>

285
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:13,537
<i>I need you to run a name
through the computer for me.</i>

286
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,874
Yeah. Yeah, I'll check for you.

287
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:19,068
-What's his name?
<i>-Jonish Kukoc.</i>

288
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:22,218
Jonish Kukoc. Jonish Kukoc.

289
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:24,283
Is he a client of Murray's or what?

290
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:27,369
Jesus.

291
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,278
Go around!

292
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:39,130
Ah, Jesus.

293
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:12,857
You trying to outrun them in this...
this cowboy Yankee piece of shit.

294
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,486
What, you got a better idea?

295
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,795
-Give me a gun!
-I can't give you a gun.

296
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,563
They're gonna kill both of us.

297
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:47,529
-Give me a gun!
-Under the seat.

298
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:16,790
Get off of me! Get off! Get off!

299
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:27,610
Hurry! Run!

300
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:51,685
You bastard!

301
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,439
This is your lucky day, Sonny McLaine.

302
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,454
I guess we'll talk a little later.

303
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:51,287
How do you get into these jams, junior?

304
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:53,988
-Anybody want a beer?
-Yeah, I want a beer.

305
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,631
They beat you up pretty good there,
Sonny-Boy?

306
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:00,752
Yeah, one of them
had this big old ring on.

307
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:01,949
So you said.

308
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:04,803
Yeah, that's what I said.
What? You doubting my word?

309
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,522
No. No. It's just that you got
a lot of questions to answer.

310
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,138
You left a trail of bodies out there.

311
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:12,105
Yeah, well, one of which was almost mine.

312
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:14,126
Keep on pushing, and it will be.

313
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:19,990
Hey, look. I believe you,
but you got to convince the DA.

314
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,906
It was your gun at the scene.
And your bullets in that guy's back.

315
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:25,949
Stop being on my side, will you, Rass?

316
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:28,292
You got yourself
right in the middle of it.

317
00:31:28,707 --> 00:31:31,574
At least we got a picture of the bruise
before it spread out too much.

318
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:32,960
That's a solid lead.

319
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:35,120
Too bad
he didn't hit you a few more times.

320
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,796
All the better
for making a lasting impression.

321
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:40,831
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

322
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,163
-What?
-It's Casey.

323
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:44,096
Casey?

324
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:46,074
I called her at the school.

325
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,402
All I told her
was that you were in an accident...

326
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:50,694
...and you wrecked your truck.

327
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:53,765
-Yeah, but she's gonna be all upset now.
-Aw, man. Give me a break.

328
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:56,304
-What break?
-What happened?

329
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,046
Oh, he's all right, Casey.
He just got a concussion.

330
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,070
-A concussion!
-Here's his medication.

331
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,841
-This is great. What have you been doing?
-I'll see you later.

332
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,727
You have medication and everything?

333
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:09,788
-What did the doctor say?
-It's Jake's fault.

334
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,693
-Good-bye, guys.
-Good-bye, champ.

335
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:14,955
It's Jake... Honey don't do this.
Don't do this.

336
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,566
She's crazy to marry that girl.

337
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,746
Yeah, and he's crazy not
to quit this line of business.

338
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:20,195
Especially with a kid on the way.

339
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:36,666
Are you sure you're okay
driving around with that?

340
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:38,462
Yes, I'm fine.

341
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:40,578
I mean, I'm just worried about you.

342
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:43,825
I know, but I'm gonna be fine.
Really. I'm going to be okay.

343
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,023
Okay.

344
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:57,732
Now, we will take better care of my truck
than we did your truck, won't we?

345
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:00,560
Right.

346
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:03,303
Please?

347
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,775
<i>This is a set up.</i>

348
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,105
We got friends from old country,
they told us to come to you.

349
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,437
<i>Who sent you to kill me?</i>

350
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:34,844
My parents are dead.
I buried them both 10 years ago.

351
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:37,621
<i>Any idea why someone sent
a bounty hunter to collect you?</i>

352
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,316
<i>They're gonna kill us both!</i>

353
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,662
They're going to kill me
and then they are going to kill you!

354
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:42,723
<i>You're a dead man.</i>

355
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:13,870
He's in there.

356
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:22,656
-What did you do, lose your wallet again?
-Oh, yeah, well, yeah, yeah.

357
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:26,669
Uh, yeah, thanks for coming by.
I wanted to talk to you.

358
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:28,811
Sit down. Sit down.

359
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:32,098
Okay.

360
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:36,794
What?

361
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:43,250
Uh, well, it's one of those
good news, bad news things.

362
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:50,052
I'm being charged with murder right?

363
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,682
What's the bad news?

364
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:00,372
The good news is 
I've been assigned to the case.

365
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:06,526
Good.

366
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,360
Good. Here.

367
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:22,614
-No, no, no...
-Please, Murray, I know...

368
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:25,221
I know, Sonny, we were lucky
that they granted bail.

369
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:28,125
I'm gonna have to take your house
as collateral, all right?

370
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,330
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah, right.

371
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:32,731
Now, listen to me, the bonding company
would never let me...

372
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:35,216
...have something this big on
the books without collateral.

373
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,433
They'd shut me down.

374
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:42,370
-You're serious.
-Yeah, I'm serious.

375
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:50,162
-What's worrying you? Casey?
-Yeah.

376
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:55,337
Mom's the word. She'll never know.
Okay? My hand to God.

377
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,102
-Yeah.
-All right.

378
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:03,471
Come by this afternoon
to sign the papers, all right?

379
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:05,389
We'll order in a corned beef sandwich.

380
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,651
Mr Tuzla wants to see you.

381
00:36:17,788 --> 00:36:18,662
Who?

382
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:29,623
Sonny McLaine.

383
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:32,809
You big ox.

384
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:39,120
-Mr Tuzla.
-Sit down.

385
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,830
If you don't mind, sir,
I'm a little confused.

386
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:46,525
What the hell am I doing here?

387
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:50,075
Do you know who Jonish Kukoc was?

388
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,110
One of your people?

389
00:36:58,245 --> 00:36:59,994
He was my sister's child.

390
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:03,217
I raised him like my own son.

391
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:07,790
I didn't kill him.

392
00:37:08,244 --> 00:37:09,211
Then who did?

393
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:11,957
Answer my son.

394
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:18,522
Two people hired me to find him.

395
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,961
A Lazlo and Eva Kukoc.

396
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:23,280
-They said they were his parents.
-I know of no such people.

397
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,826
-Quit fucking lying!
-I'm not fucking lying!

398
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,653
-Did you kill Jonish?
-No!

399
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:30,319
Liar! The police charged you with murder.

400
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:33,085
Enough, Danny! You have people to meet.
I don't want you to be late.

401
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,130
-Liar!
-Enough!

402
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:39,459
I know.

403
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,460
You say you didn't kill Jonish,

404
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,760
but he was in your responsibility,
in your custody. Drink.

405
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:02,349
I will give you only a little time
to bring me the killer.

406
00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:06,754
If not, I promise,
you will join Jonish in his grave.

407
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,345
Mr Tuzla? I didn't kill your nephew.

408
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:14,800
You know me and you know my family.

409
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,754
Men change, Sonny McLaine.

410
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:24,464
It is not the same world at dawn
as it is at dusk.

411
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:32,365
Even if I did believe you, Danny will not.

412
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:35,673
Go.

413
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:44,704
Sonny.

414
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:48,474
Bring me proof.

415
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,281
You turned up nothing, Sonny.

416
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,649
No information. No leads.
No evidence. Nothing.

417
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:02,025
Pack it in cowboy,
leave it to the professionals.

418
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:03,827
-Oh, like you?
-Yeah, like me.

419
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:06,614
-You got a problem with that?
-No, I do not have a problem with that.

420
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:09,012
Look, you're the DA's number one
with a bullet suspect.

421
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,924
Which makes me even more motivated
to find him.

422
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:12,492
Oh, listen to me, please.

423
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:15,670
You can't be involved
with this investigation. Cannot.

424
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:19,795
As in illegal, as in against the law.
Do you read me?

425
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:24,732
Okay.

426
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:29,798
Kukoc was a nephew of Greg Tuzla's.
There.

427
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,638
How the fuck did you find that out?

428
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,818
-Because he told me. 
-When?

429
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,909
Never mind when. Does it matter?

430
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,005
Oh, fuck.

431
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:45,949
We better put you into protective custody.

432
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,495
No, way. No.

433
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,216
All right. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

434
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:52,977
If you're determined to do this,
ask yourself this one question first.

435
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:57,700
What was it Jonish Kukoc
doing in that cabin?

436
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,503
Pretty professional, huh?

437
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,010
Another beer, John.

438
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,840
You know,
Casey won't let me eat this stuff at home.

439
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:23,007
You sound like you already married guy.
Look.

440
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:30,311
This took more goddamn spade work
than you have dick hairs.

441
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:34,218
Here it is. The arrest report is a phony.

442
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:38,015
Where ever that old couple got it,
it wasn't from the police department.

443
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:42,613
-What about Tuzla?
-He's dangerous, man.

444
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:46,184
Maybe Racine should put a 24 hour watch
on your house.

445
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,063
Tuzla's old school.
He's not gonna mess with family.

446
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:50,229
What about Kukoc?

447
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,477
He's wanted by immigration
for being illegal in this country.

448
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:56,873
Illegal?
He's got a New York drivers license, Jake.

449
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:57,962
And a green card.

450
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:00,995
But as part of the information exchange
with the former Soviet Union,

451
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,545
his criminal records caught up with him.

452
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:05,282
The INS labeled him undesirable.

453
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:06,914
He appealed and lost.

454
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:09,211
Before they could deport him,
he disappeared.

455
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:12,774
Where the hell you get all this?
I mean Rass doesn't even have it.

456
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:15,059
Unless he's not saying.

457
00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:16,393
Rass is a good cop.

458
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:18,712
Look, I was a cop for 40 years.

459
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,007
I still have my connections, you know.

460
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,051
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not gonna eat it?

461
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:31,372
It doesn't taste as good as it used to.

462
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,749
-Hey, Sonny.
-What?

463
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,846
-Be careful.
-Yeah. Thanks.

464
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,685
Talk to me, you fuck. Come on.

465
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:36,839
Come on. Come on. You gonna talk to me?

466
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:39,853
Talk to me you piece of shit.

467
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:49,001
-Big Shot, you scared?
-You fuck.

468
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:52,497
Look I can make this quick,
or I can make it slow.

469
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:55,153
Tell me what you know,
and I'll make it quick.

470
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,449
Make it fast.

471
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:01,048
Fuck you.

472
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:05,594
Danny!

473
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:09,977
Put the gun down!

474
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,145
I'm doing what you should have done!

475
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,515
You'll kill him,
when I tell you to kill him!

476
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:18,575
Put the gun down! Put the gun away!

477
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:20,977
You, you, out.

478
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,193
Andre will take you where you want to go.

479
00:43:41,471 --> 00:43:44,760
Just do me a favor Mr Tuzla,
you keep your son off me.

480
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,461
I can't do any good
while he's jacking me up...

481
00:43:47,546 --> 00:43:48,878
...in the back of warehouses.

482
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,819
-What happened to you?
-I had a run in.

483
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,459
Do you want to fill me in
on what's going on between you and Tuzla?

484
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:06,091
Otherwise, what is this doing here?

485
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,895
When I figure it out, you'll know.

486
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,846
You'll be dead before you figure it out.

487
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:13,266
What about the ring?

488
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:17,604
I'm gonna get forensics
to enhance the details of the ring.

489
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:20,321
-Can I have this one?
-No, it's evidence.

490
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:24,252
Why? What's up?

491
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:30,102
I'm getting close, Rass.
I'm getting close and this could help.

492
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:44,237
-See you later, Sonny.
-All right, Rass.

493
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,714
-Say hi to Casey for me.
-All right. All right.

494
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:50,481
Hey, Jake! You owe me a brew.

495
00:44:58,108 --> 00:44:58,978
Thank you.

496
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,323
-Yeah.
-Sonny, it's Jake.

497
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:07,733
So, what's up Jake?

498
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:11,942
Come to 1704 Mission Street.
Apartment 206.

499
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:14,030
I got some people here
I want you to meet.

500
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:15,747
<i>Who?</i>

501
00:45:16,107 --> 00:45:18,731
For a little cash,
they'll be whoever you want them to be.

502
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:02,682
Recognize them?

503
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:07,307
Yep. The grieving parents, I presume.

504
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,798
Meet George and Bridget McCully.

505
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:12,783
Blacker Irish souls you never saw.

506
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:16,139
Fuck you. Thank you very much.

507
00:46:16,224 --> 00:46:20,045
-What happened to your accent?
-I shoved it up your ass, pal, okay.

508
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:23,766
I want you both
the fuck out of this apartment, now.

509
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:27,808
You ain't the cops,
so you ain't got a warrant.

510
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:28,743
Shut up!

511
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,283
I busted these two several
times back in the '80s...

512
00:46:33,368 --> 00:46:35,838
...doing the same gypsy Russian grift.

513
00:46:36,274 --> 00:46:37,631
I thought I'd check them out.

514
00:46:43,154 --> 00:46:45,060
You set me up and I want to know why.

515
00:46:45,443 --> 00:46:47,985
The man who was killed
was Gregor Tuzla's nephew.

516
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,697
Do you know what that means?

517
00:46:49,782 --> 00:46:52,175
It means your buddy's ass is in a sling.

518
00:46:52,564 --> 00:46:55,282
-So is yours, pal.
-Oh, I don't think so.

519
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:58,276
Why not? You think
you got a guardian angel or something?

520
00:46:58,652 --> 00:46:59,882
Something like that.

521
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,247
That guardian angel wouldn't happen
to be Danny Tuzla, now would it?

522
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,975
You know, Mr Tuzla's not gonna like
the fact that you set up his nephew.

523
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,519
We were in Cleveland last week.
Right, dear?

524
00:47:24,295 --> 00:47:26,374
So fuck off and get out of my home.

525
00:47:27,104 --> 00:47:29,308
The last person that did
that to me, I bit it off.

526
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:31,818
Real good.

527
00:47:32,537 --> 00:47:34,744
They ain't gonna talk. Call Racine.

528
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,847
You need them on the record

529
00:47:36,932 --> 00:47:39,335
to convince the DA to drop
the charges against you.

530
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,240
It's not the DA I'm worried about.

531
00:47:41,848 --> 00:47:44,436
Yeah, Tuzla will find out about it too.

532
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,712
I'm sure I can beat it out of them.

533
00:47:53,189 --> 00:47:55,148
Right. Leave that to the cops.

534
00:47:57,545 --> 00:47:59,479
-Shit!
-What?

535
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:03,570
I got Casey's car.
She needs a ride home from school.

536
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,232
Can't someone else take her?

537
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,537
I really don't want her going home alone.

538
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,390
Okay. I'll take care of these two.

539
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:16,142
You call Racine, pick up Casey.
Come meet us at the precinct.

540
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:26,057
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Sonny, I was a cop for 40 years.

541
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:28,984
-Forty years?
-Yeah.

542
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,651
I thought it was 30.

543
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:38,227
God, whatever. Just get going.

544
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:48,568
-You should buckle up.
-Next stop light, I'll buckle up.

545
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,112
Is there any way
to make that image clearer?

546
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,900
-To... To what?
-To make it clearer.

547
00:49:16,322 --> 00:49:18,874
Well, you could dither it, I suppose.

548
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,686
-Sonny!
-What?

549
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:25,554
I thought you were gonna get out of this.
You said you were going to quit.

550
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,076
-I'm gonna quit. I will.
-This is not quitting.

551
00:49:34,356 --> 00:49:35,747
What took you so long?

552
00:49:38,747 --> 00:49:39,887
Over there.

553
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:48,272
Hold it right there.

554
00:49:55,855 --> 00:49:57,239
I got to go out again, babe.

555
00:49:58,576 --> 00:50:01,022
Hey, what do you mean
you have to go out again.

556
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:02,502
I have to go out again.

557
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:04,353
Well,
I was just gonna make you some dinner.

558
00:50:05,832 --> 00:50:07,799
-Well...
-Who's gonna rub my tummy?

559
00:50:09,748 --> 00:50:11,804
Maybe if I stay,
I can rub more than your tummy.

560
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:14,764
-Good idea, huh.
-Gotta go.

561
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:16,076
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

562
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:17,857
-Bye.
-Bye.

563
00:50:27,451 --> 00:50:29,346
-Yeah?
<i>-Where are you, Sonny?</i>

564
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,253
I'm just leaving the house.
Did you catch up with Jake?

565
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:37,105
<i>Yeah, you better get your butt over
to the Lady of Mercy Hospital right away.</i>

566
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:48,240
Jake's gonna be okay.

567
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:53,542
He'll be out of op in an hour or two.
Just a shoulder wound.

568
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,562
Go get some rest.

569
00:51:00,903 --> 00:51:03,797
-What happened, Rass?
-I don't know for sure.

570
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,143
One gunman came in,
popped the old couple,

571
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:07,104
put one in Jake.

572
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,148
Jake tagged him and the guy got away.

573
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:12,820
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

574
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:20,067
The two that got killed
were the ones who set you up, right?

575
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:24,063
And you had Jake track them down, right?

576
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:29,537
I wasn't trying to keep that from you.

577
00:51:30,763 --> 00:51:32,705
Well, the big problem with that is,

578
00:51:34,218 --> 00:51:36,027
Jake was nearly killed, Sonny.

579
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,891
What did I tell you
about doing things on your own?

580
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:44,986
-I feel bad enough as it is, okay?
-Well, isn't that fucking terrible?

581
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,266
Jake's in there almost killed 
and you feel bad about it.

582
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:50,896
Yeah.

583
00:51:52,535 --> 00:51:53,586
I feel bad.

584
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:02,371
Sonny, I admire you.

585
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:04,736
A lot like I admire Jake.

586
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:06,754
But you got to stop playing cop.

587
00:52:07,146 --> 00:52:09,604
Acting like you're better at this
and smarter than us...

588
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:13,180
...simply because you're allowed
to work on a different set of rules.

589
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:28,859
Shit.

590
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,772
Didn't your father tell you
to back off, junior?

591
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,973
Junior? That's funny, man.

592
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:38,920
Sonny?

593
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:47,192
My father wants to talk to you.

594
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:48,963
Yeah? Well, I'm not in the mood right now.

595
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:50,569
-Not in the mood? Not in the mood.
-No.

596
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:52,065
How about this you fuck?

597
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:55,948
Fucking big shot.

598
00:53:10,176 --> 00:53:12,154
My father taught me how to make vodka.

599
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:15,437
I taught Jonish. And I taught Danny.

600
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,316
How do you like my vodka, Sonny McLaine?

601
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,326
I thought we had a deal.

602
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:26,914
Is it because you thought
I was responsible for your father's death?

603
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,826
Is that why you struck at me
through Jonish?

604
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:30,444
What are you talking about?

605
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:34,966
Jonish's best friend, Boris,
saw you shoot Jonish! He was there!

606
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:37,580
He might have been there,
but he's lying about what he saw.

607
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:46,420
How is it everyone lies but you?

608
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:49,021
'Cause maybe they have something to hide.

609
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,612
It had to be someone in your organization
who betrayed Jonish.

610
00:53:56,702 --> 00:53:59,077
Yeah? That still doesn't mean
you didn't pull the trigger.

611
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:02,603
-Oh, what would my motive be?
-What would your motive be?

612
00:54:03,518 --> 00:54:06,243
Revenge.
Or maybe someone paid you to do it, huh?

613
00:54:10,061 --> 00:54:11,472
You know? Maybe you did it.

614
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:14,492
Or Boris did it?

615
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,605
I would have died for Jonish!

616
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,061
Either Sonny is lying.
Or Boris is lying. Or both.

617
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:25,152
Look. Just let me whack him.

618
00:54:25,906 --> 00:54:28,111
There's already talk in the street
about how you're getting soft.

619
00:54:28,196 --> 00:54:31,156
If this talk reaches our visitors,
we won't be able to negotiate.

620
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:34,699
By sunset Friday, I must have the killer.

621
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:36,430
-You understand?
-Yeah.

622
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:38,495
You have until then.

623
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,605
God!

624
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,277
You always loved working with pop, huh?

625
00:54:51,794 --> 00:54:54,114
Me, Murray and your father.
What a group we made.

626
00:54:55,182 --> 00:54:57,532
I'd book 'em, Murray bail 'em,

627
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,828
and your father would bring them back
after they skipped.

628
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:04,607
You got his chin, you know?

629
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:07,942
Yeah?

630
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:10,701
Tell me something Jake.

631
00:55:12,224 --> 00:55:14,061
What happened between Tuzla and my father?

632
00:55:15,164 --> 00:55:17,403
Your mother never told you
how your father died?

633
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,519
Well, she said that...

634
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,587
...he was protecting
someone and he was killed.

635
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:24,633
That's all she said.

636
00:55:27,693 --> 00:55:30,187
I suppose if I was trying to explain...

637
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:33,340
...what happened to a 10 year old boy,
I'd say the same thing.

638
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:40,686
Come on Jake,
you telling me my mom was lying?

639
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:45,790
Your father was caught in circumstances
similar to yours.

640
00:55:46,782 --> 00:55:49,974
He had collared his man,
and someone tried to make a hit.

641
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:53,662
They shot it out.
He took one in the chest.

642
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,320
The fugitive drove him to the hospital,
but it was too late.

643
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,491
Gregor Tuzla was the fugitive.

644
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:12,213
Hey, man. That's no way to greet a friend.
Put that thing away.

645
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:14,776
What? You here to arrest me?

646
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:17,013
I should.
You'd be a hell of a lot better off.

647
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:19,056
You think whoever it is,
won't get me in jail?

648
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,870
Well,
they'd have to come through me first.

649
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:27,109
Come on. Let's go in the house.
It's cold out here. Come on. Move. Move.

650
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:30,019
Hemmingway said,
"If you live long enough,"

651
00:56:30,104 --> 00:56:33,058
"you'll see everything you love
in the world die or be destroyed."

652
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,344
You don't strike me as a Hemmingway type.

653
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:43,682
I memorized it years ago to pick up women.

654
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:47,322
-Did it work?
-But of course.

655
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,184
Checked with a buddy of mine
in the Organized Crime Group.

656
00:56:53,196 --> 00:56:55,536
Bought him a few drinks.
He told me a few things.

657
00:56:57,962 --> 00:56:59,376
It seems pretty plain to me...

658
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:02,728
...that there's a power struggle
going on in Tuzla's house.

659
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:08,938
Yeah,
Tuzla did mention something like that.

660
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,735
-When did you talk to him?
-Tonight.

661
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:15,810
Aw, man, Sonny. What did I tell you
about withholding evidence?

662
00:57:15,895 --> 00:57:17,662
It's not withholding evidence.

663
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,708
I'm under a lot of pressure, God damn it!

664
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:22,636
I know you're under a lot of pressure!

665
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:25,577
I can't give you much more time!

666
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:49,444
Thanks for coming right back.

667
00:58:00,532 --> 00:58:02,988
-I love you.
-Don't...

668
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:31,195
Are you gonna talk to me?

669
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,475
Where were you all night?

670
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:45,198
Jake got shot last night.

671
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,195
He's gonna be okay.

672
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:57,394
Are you in danger? Am I in danger?

673
00:58:57,484 --> 00:58:58,862
No, I would have told you.

674
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,788
Damn you, Sonny. Damn you!

675
00:59:03,325 --> 00:59:06,618
Case, look, I understand
you're anger, okay,

676
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:08,539
just bare with me.

677
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:15,805
I'm going to birthing class
this afternoon, room 103.

678
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,178
Are you gonna be there?

679
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:24,002
Yeah.

680
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:26,982
Great. I'll see you there.

681
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:33,696
Sonny?

682
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:36,470
Clean the car.

683
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,151
Now these are the men
that were killed outside of that cabin.

684
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,498
All illegal immigrants,
and all Russian Mafia.

685
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,561
The American Russian Mafia
and the Mafia from Russia are merging.

686
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,694
And guess who the OCG thinks
has the point man...

687
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:57,462
...for both sides for the merging?

688
00:59:57,547 --> 00:59:58,882
Jonish Kukoc.

689
00:59:59,353 --> 01:00:00,613
But he had one problem.

690
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,831
Yeah, he was about to be deported.

691
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:08,447
But there was one particular person
that was against the merging.

692
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,160
His cousin, Danny?

693
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:13,731
Tuzla was gonna make Jonish
the head of the organization.

694
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:15,803
-Jonish pissed Danny off.
-Yes.

695
01:00:16,273 --> 01:00:18,280
And Danny's hot headed
and not overly bright.

696
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:20,809
Everyone, including Tuzla, knows that.

697
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:24,758
No one from the Russian Organization likes
or trusts Danny.

698
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:30,379
But despite his shortcomings,
Danny's very ambitious.

699
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,903
So, Jonish is killed.

700
01:00:37,822 --> 01:00:39,267
And the hit's hung on me,

701
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,375
to keep Tuzla from seeing
Danny's hand in it.

702
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:45,077
You got it. You were the easy target.

703
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:48,958
History replays itself.

704
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:56,329
Oh, shit! Time? What time is it?

705
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,284
Ten to 4:00 PM.

706
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,254
Casey.

707
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:08,163
The most important thing
about birthing is to breathe.

708
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:09,953
To breathe.

709
01:01:10,038 --> 01:01:13,405
Breathing from the check people.
Good work, Steven. Wonderful.

710
01:01:14,189 --> 01:01:16,783
Diaphragmatic intercostal muscles 
feeling the strain.

711
01:01:18,031 --> 01:01:20,037
Yes, Bob. Yes, wonderful. Imaging.

712
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:23,286
We are three, yet we are one now.
Wonderful.

713
01:01:25,065 --> 01:01:28,171
-The birthing class? Birthing class?
-On your left.

714
01:01:28,545 --> 01:01:30,064
Second door on your left.

715
01:01:32,948 --> 01:01:34,770
No, no. No, no. No.

716
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,984
Hey, hey. Further down.
The next one on your left.

717
01:01:38,286 --> 01:01:39,393
The second door.

718
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:43,035
Excellent breathing, Casey. Wonderful.
Yes.

719
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,527
And breathing and breathing.

720
01:01:47,607 --> 01:01:49,112
You must be Sonny McLaine?

721
01:01:49,808 --> 01:01:51,502
I see you've already
begun your breathing.

722
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:52,845
Please, come in and join us.

723
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:56,830
The breathing and breathing. Excellent.
Continue breathing. Wonderful.

724
01:02:02,808 --> 01:02:04,254
This is getting tougher now.

725
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,351
-Want some juice?
-Yeah, juice would be good.

726
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:10,155
Okay. Give me a kiss.

727
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:47,774
Oh, thank you. Hey.

728
01:03:23,444 --> 01:03:24,947
Hey, get up.

729
01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:52,194
Rass, I need some cars
to Hill Avenue School. And I need it now.

730
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:56,707
Come on. Move. I got to go.
Just do as I said.

731
01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:09,950
Drop it, the helmet, man.

732
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:50,018
Okay, helmet, man, let's see who you are.

733
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:54,993
You keep everyone in that classroom,

734
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,386
-you understand?
-Yeah.

735
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:57,818
-My wife's in there.
-Okay.

736
01:04:57,908 --> 01:05:00,197
I want you to call the police,
Detective Racine.

737
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,110
-Racine, Racine.
-Fifty-two.

738
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,779
-Fifty-two. Okay. I got it.
-Again.

739
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:07,105
-All right. Racine, fifty two. I got it.
-Go.

740
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:23,429
Stay in the classroom!
Stay in the classroom.

741
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,104
-You're gonna be okay. Stay in there.
-What's going on?

742
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:26,856
We're gonna be okay,
he's calling the police.

743
01:05:26,941 --> 01:05:28,474
I'm sure everything is gonna be fine.

744
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:47,070
I'm sure it sounds much worse than it is.

745
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,072
I'm sure
he's got everything under control.

746
01:07:19,157 --> 01:07:21,187
No, Anna. Don't go. Anna.

747
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:24,667
Go that way.

748
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:34,315
Get back inside!

749
01:07:40,663 --> 01:07:42,287
Go! Get back inside!

750
01:07:58,562 --> 01:07:59,618
No!

751
01:08:08,395 --> 01:08:11,486
No! No!

752
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:17,743
Rass. Rass.

753
01:08:19,276 --> 01:08:22,450
No ID on the bodies. Probably illegals.

754
01:08:23,351 --> 01:08:25,316
At least whoever's after you
is consistent.

755
01:08:27,515 --> 01:08:29,320
So, Tuzla wouldn't hurt anyone, huh?

756
01:08:31,903 --> 01:08:33,238
This wasn't Tuzla.

757
01:08:40,736 --> 01:08:41,854
Hang in there, Casey.

758
01:08:45,232 --> 01:08:46,314
Can I talk to you inside?

759
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:51,731
I don't want you going back home.
It's too dangerous.

760
01:08:51,816 --> 01:08:54,700
I have no intentions of going back home.
Hand me my car keys.

761
01:08:56,038 --> 01:08:57,735
Hand me my car keys, Sonny.

762
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,880
You lied to me, Sonny.

763
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:06,874
You put me and everybody in that class
in danger.

764
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:10,379
-Wait a minute.
-No! Just stop!

765
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:16,526
Looks like you need a ride.

766
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:23,084
I'll walk.

767
01:09:32,523 --> 01:09:36,211
Sorry, Noel. Is Casey here.

768
01:09:36,725 --> 01:09:37,579
Just a sec.

769
01:09:51,097 --> 01:09:52,013
Hi.

770
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:53,906
Hi.

771
01:09:56,498 --> 01:09:58,405
I came by to get the picture I gave you.

772
01:09:58,636 --> 01:10:01,404
Oh, okay. Just a second.

773
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:10,807
This is...
This is as far as I could get it.

774
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:15,585
-It's good.
-Yeah.

775
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:19,319
-This is really great.
-Oh, good. Good.

776
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:24,257
-Okay.
-Wait.

777
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,385
I just want you to know
that I'm really trying...

778
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,598
Trying to get out of this mess.
I'm really trying.

779
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:32,491
Yeah, I know, I know, Sonny.

780
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:38,284
I guess, I just have to decide
if I can live with what it is you do.

781
01:10:39,648 --> 01:10:42,813
And you have to decide...

782
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:46,542
...if you can live without me and the baby
if I can't.

783
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:50,925
But I thought relationships
were about compromise, Case.

784
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:54,568
-Compromise.
-Yeah.

785
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:57,505
They are, Sonny.

786
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:16,474
Oh, Sonny.

787
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:27,456
Before you say anything, Mr Tuzla.

788
01:11:28,228 --> 01:11:30,239
The police took this photo
right after the attack.

789
01:11:31,015 --> 01:11:33,684
The man who killed Jonish,
hit me without his gloves on.

790
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:38,234
-You were hit by a man wearing this ring?
-Yes, sir. The killer.

791
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:40,633
I think it was Danny.

792
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:45,048
Yeah, that's the ring.

793
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:49,513
Very interesting, Sonny.
Because this is Jonish's ring.

794
01:11:50,109 --> 01:11:52,391
The police gave it to me
along with his personal effects.

795
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,956
But I saw that same ring
on Danny's finger.

796
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:01,559
I gave them both one, several years ago.

797
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:05,596
So perhaps what happened was,
Jonish fought with you.

798
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:07,441
That's how you got the imprint
in your head.

799
01:12:07,764 --> 01:12:09,214
But when you saw the ring
on Danny's finger,

800
01:12:09,299 --> 01:12:10,816
you saw a good way to blame him.

801
01:12:10,901 --> 01:12:11,789
No!

802
01:12:12,727 --> 01:12:14,126
No, Mr Tuzla.

803
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:17,927
Look. I did not kill your nephew.
Your son did...

804
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:20,181
...and I know you don't want to hear it,
but that is the truth.

805
01:12:20,266 --> 01:12:22,211
And you know what? 
He's gonna do the same damn thing to you.

806
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,584
-No!
-Yes!

807
01:12:24,618 --> 01:12:26,731
Who has more to lose
if the merger goes through?

808
01:12:26,816 --> 01:12:28,525
-Danny!
-Enough of this!

809
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,753
You expect me to believe
that now you are on my side?

810
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,101
No.

811
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:43,300
Mr Tuzla, all I'm trying to do
is save my life and your life.

812
01:12:43,385 --> 01:12:44,226
That's all.

813
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:46,581
Please.

814
01:12:51,168 --> 01:12:52,928
Hold him
until I come back from the meeting.

815
01:12:54,761 --> 01:12:58,078
-Please.
-We all know your father was a good man.

816
01:13:07,058 --> 01:13:08,158
Howdy, Boris.

817
01:13:13,596 --> 01:13:15,811
Tuzla's not gonna like this much, Boris.

818
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,067
Danny's mad. Not Tuzla.

819
01:13:23,142 --> 01:13:26,256
Before I kill you,
let's see what you got tough guy.

820
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:04,812
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

821
01:14:07,392 --> 01:14:08,242
Hey!

822
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:16,799
Come on, what is going on?

823
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:22,308
Yes, yes.

824
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:29,094
Oh, nice one. Okay.

825
01:14:33,694 --> 01:14:35,344
Jake, you busy today?

826
01:14:37,998 --> 01:14:42,509
Okay, we're rolling.
Hey, Sonny, don't do nothing stupid.

827
01:16:20,755 --> 01:16:24,468
Thank you all for coming.
We have been a part of history today.

828
01:16:25,654 --> 01:16:27,254
To the new organization.

829
01:16:27,546 --> 01:16:30,352
Which you have all had the insight
to participate in.

830
01:16:35,152 --> 01:16:38,810
May our enemies harvest bitter wheat.

831
01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:43,611
<i>Nostrovny.</i>

832
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,394
-Stop!
-No!

833
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,979
Damn! Sounds like a war zone.

834
01:17:42,172 --> 01:17:43,062
Go.

835
01:18:24,312 --> 01:18:27,290
I'm being killed by my own son?

836
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,102
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

837
01:18:31,192 --> 01:18:33,388
Why, Danny? Why?

838
01:18:42,534 --> 01:18:46,134
You always thought Jonish was so good.
So pure.

839
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:49,015
You couldn't see it.

840
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:52,761
He's trying to push me out. Me, your son.

841
01:18:57,098 --> 01:19:00,709
I know he would of eventually
had me killed. So I...

842
01:19:03,394 --> 01:19:04,768
There is no escape for you.

843
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,704
You've started a war that will never end.

844
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,055
I'll finish it.

845
01:19:11,383 --> 01:19:13,712
And in the end,
I will be the head of this organization...

846
01:19:13,802 --> 01:19:15,808
...with no interference
from the old country.

847
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,819
At what cost, Danny?

848
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:27,853
I never wanted it this intense.

849
01:19:32,398 --> 01:19:34,052
I account you for killing him.

850
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,593
I should have killed you on the mountain.

851
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:54,091
Yeah, you should have killed me.

852
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:10,542
Are you gonna take care of his plants?

853
01:21:12,486 --> 01:21:13,335
Yeah.

854
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:26,489
You know, Jake.

855
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:34,606
-The only family Rass had was you and me.
-Yeah.

856
01:21:39,485 --> 01:21:41,773
Rass would have been very proud of you.

857
01:21:44,014 --> 01:21:45,068
Yeah.

858
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:48,338
He would of been proud
of the both of us, Jake.

859
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:05,014
Don't let that girl walk out of your life.

860
01:22:32,933 --> 01:22:35,385
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

861
01:22:38,046 --> 01:22:41,093
-What? What's this?
-It's an agreement between Murray and me.

862
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:44,467
Fifty-fifty partners
in the bail bond business.

863
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,869
Part of the arrangement
is that I still go out on some cases.

864
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,952
Just the big ones. Okay?

865
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:58,933
Well, I guess it's a start.

866
01:23:03,176 --> 01:23:05,423
-Hey.
-Yes?

867
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:10,719
Are you busy this afternoon?

868
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:13,582
What did you have in mind?

869
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:16,364
A wedding.

870
01:23:18,016 --> 01:23:19,000
Whose?

871
01:23:20,727 --> 01:23:21,928
Yours and mine.
