1
00:00:58,107 --> 00:01:00,599
- Look like Stu just brought a friend.

2
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,611
Child's play.

3
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:04,082
Four guys?

4
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,854
Don't insult me.

5
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,010
I'll be home by 7:00.

6
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:13,745
Let's go.

7
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:16,815
- Welcome to our new home, gentlemen.

8
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:19,247
I want security everywhere,
though, all right?

9
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:21,800
Cameras in these corners,
and back there, too.

10
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:22,851
You and I are gonna be in the front.

11
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:24,625
I'll meet him at the entrance.

12
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,364
I want you on the right.

13
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:27,198
I want you in this way.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,286
I'm gonna come in.

15
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,518
You're gonna loop around.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,702
We'll take 'em right here in the middle.

17
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:32,881
- They're not gonna see it coming.

18
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:35,636
- You're gonna be with me
here in the middle, and then-

19
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,291
Uh-uh.

20
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:40,929
All right, here's gonna be your office.

21
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:41,765
Here's mine.

22
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,278
I don't know if you're gonna get one.

23
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,983
We're also gonna be here, too.

24
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:54,235
- Shoot 'em.

25
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:55,194
- Oh, damn.

26
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:43,594
- Ya' still hanging around, huh?

27
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,429
Okay.

28
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:48,737
Good morning, Louis Lane.

29
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,478
You're looking mighty like cute today.

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,312
No, no, no, no.

31
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:52,310
Yes, you are.

32
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,142
I said it, and you doing it.

33
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,163
Did you just wink at me?

34
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,334
I know you did.

35
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,811
Yeah, I love it.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,710
- Mr.
Boyd, you are two months

37
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,451
past due on all your loans.

38
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:04,983
- Nope.

39
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,484
- This is
the Bank of San Francisco

40
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,806
calling for Chester.

41
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,638
- This is your agent.

42
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,460
The deadline for the treatments passed.

43
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,162
That really puts me in pickle.

44
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,644
- I know, I know, I know.

45
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:16,477
- Hi, Chester.

46
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,617
This is Amy calling from Doggy Daycare.

47
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:20,913
We do have an opening today.

48
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:23,662
- Oh, let's see what
the doctor has to say.

49
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,495
- This is Amy.

50
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,329
- Hey, Amy.

51
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,163
Yeah, it's Chester.

52
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:26,997
- Hey Chester.
- Hi.

53
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:27,926
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with her.

54
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:29,247
I'm hoping it's nothing.

55
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,319
But ever since her fall, she, uh,

56
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,220
she hasn't been the same.

57
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:34,292
- Anytime before
noon, you can come in?

58
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:35,584
- Oh, that, that's great.

59
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,417
Thank you.

60
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,251
- See soon.

61
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:38,087
- Okay. Bye.

62
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,130
Oh, I'm sure you're okay. I know.

63
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:43,361
I'm sure you're pretty good.

64
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:44,195
Get over here!

65
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,283
Get over here.

66
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,265
Yes, you are the cutest
thing in the world.

67
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,703
You're the cutest thing. Okay?

68
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:50,869
I gotta go get dressed.

69
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,040
Okay, get this job.

70
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,099
I'm gonna get this job for us.

71
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,935

- Hey!

80
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,249
Over here.

81
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,083
- Hey.

82
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:49,917
- I don't know what's wrong with it.

83
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,043
I won't start.

84
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:51,877
I don't know.

85
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,481
I dated a mechanic once, and he was, like,

86
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,561
trying to explain things
to me, but I was, like,

87
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,685
"I don't know what you're saying.

88
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,316
Can we just drive?".

89
00:04:58,318 --> 00:04:59,968
And he was, like, "Take
a look under my hood".

90
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,469
And I was, like, "Is that a euphemism?

91
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,303
I don't know.

92
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,451
You're making me uncomfortable".

93
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:04,805
Anyway, and it didn't last.

94
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,242
- Today is the day.

95
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:24,683
I got this job interview.

96
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:27,012
This ones for you, Lois Lane!

97
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,719
- So, it looks like little Lois Lane

98
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:33,181
is going to need emergency
gallbladder surgery.

99
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:35,013
- Oh, gosh. Is that bad?

100
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,484
- Well, we're not exactly sure how

101
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,067
her gallbladder ruptured,
but the sooner she can

102
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:41,199
get to an operating table, the better.

103
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,692
- Yeah. I mean, whatever it takes.

104
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:45,674
Look, Jamie, she's all I have.

105
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:46,734
- Okay.

106
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:47,568
I wanna be up front with you,

107
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,243
that this type of operation
can run up to $8,000.

108
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:56,240
- $8,000.

109
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,166
I don't have that kind of money.

110
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,989
It, Is there anything else we can do?

111
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:12,791
- Not at this time.

112
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,494
I don't know what to say, Chester.

113
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,436
- Uh, look, Chester, how about this?

114
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,809
How about we take Lois Lane, so we can

115
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,211
properly care for her,
while you figure it out?

116
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,073
Claire will take her when we're done.

117
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,845
But, just let you know,
she probably has about

118
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:29,099
six days max, if she
doesn't get the surgery.

119
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,832
So, let me know as soon as possible.

120
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:34,257
- Okay.

121
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:36,277
- Okay.

122
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:38,820
- Thank you.

123
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:43,827
- Yeah, no problem.

124
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:48,405
- I'm sorry, but she's
in good hands right now.

125
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:10,625
- Hey, girl.

126
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:18,051
Is this seat taken?

127
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,693
- I'm waiting for someone.

128
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:23,421
Are you that someone?

129
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:25,649
- I can be. Tell me what you need.

130
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,382
- Um. No.

131
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:31,330
The man I'm waiting for
already knows what I need.

132
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,164
- Oh, I can-

133
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,612
- Thank you.

134
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:34,447
Next.

135
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,141
Can I help you?

136
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,106
- Oh, yeah. Can I borrow?

137
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,238
I mean, can I have the hot sauce?

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,074
Please?

139
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:16,359
Thank you.

140
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,396
Nope. Not today.

141
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,279
- You are the plumber.

142
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,208
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

143
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,289
You said green jacket.

144
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,181
That's clearly olive.

145
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,442
I get it, though.

146
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:58,321
I understand the need for
discretion in your line of work.

147
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,409
- Plumbing?

148
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,430
- Yes.

149
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:04,232
I'm sorry if I was rude earlier.

150
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,875
I'd been waiting, and I
was starting to get antsy.

151
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:10,994
I still very much need my pipes cleared.

152
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,718
- Mm, now I see what you're doing here.

153
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:18,046
I can clear your pipes, baby girl.

154
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,217
No problem.

155
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,620
Tell me what you need,
and how you like it.

156
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,352
And, you know, how far you live from here?

157
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,807
- I live, not too far from
here, but I don't see-

158
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:30,749
How long do you think it will
take to get the job done?

159
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,812
- Depends on how thoroughly
you want your pipes clean.

160
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:35,313
I mean, we can do a 10 minute session,

161
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,231
or we can go until you're
completely satisfied.

162
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,731
- 10 minutes?

163
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,565
- Um.

164
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,597
- That's it?

165
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,430
- Uh.

166
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,588
- Oh, you are fast.

167
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,866
I guess I found a pro.

168
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:49,127
- Oh, I'm good at my job.

169
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,989
I get the job done.

170
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,400
Heh-heh-heh.

171
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,382
So, tell me what you need.

172
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,124
And how you I like it.

173
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:57,445
- What?

174
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,040
I told you what I needed over the phone.

175
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,070
Are you not the plumber?

176
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:02,971
- Oh, the phone.

177
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,463
Look, I don't want to
hear about that other guy.

178
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,836
Let's just say, he couldn't make it.

179
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:11,818
So, he sent a real plumber
to take care of the job.

180
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,953
- How unprofessional!

181
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:13,787
I can't believe he didn't tell me

182
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:15,614
somebody else would be taking his place.

183
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:16,995
- What? Excuse me?

184
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:17,831
- Nothing.

185
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,535
I brought the down payment.

186
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,628
As we discussed.

187
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:30,509
- Um, just so we're on the same page.

188
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:33,121
What exactly are the details of this job?

189
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:36,635
- I'll leave it up to you as
to how you wanna handle it,

190
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:39,007
but, before you make it
look like an accident,

191
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,805
other than that, just, you know?

192
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:48,734
- Oh, well I usually
don't get down like that.

193
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,738
But, you know, I'm game.

194
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:53,602
- Well,

195
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:54,658
how about?

196
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,432
- Oh, shit.

197
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,321
- What, is 12,000 not enough?

198
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,599
$12,000?

199
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,800
- Yes, 12,000!

200
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:09,686
Did he not tell you?

201
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm-

202
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,353
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

203
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,605
Slow down, sister girl.

204
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,440
I got you.

205
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,965
I have skills.

206
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,471
Skills that get results.

207
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,155
- Did you just lower your voice?

208
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,567
- No, It's my real voice.

209
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,015
- No, it's not.

210
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,244
- Anyway, just tell me a
little bit about the situation.

211
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,796
I'm sure we can work something out.

212
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:31,234
- If I tell you anything else, you're in.

213
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:32,904
All

214
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:33,738
the way

215
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,320
in.

216
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,935
- Uh, I'm confused again.

217
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:40,164
Are we still talking about
the same type of plumbing?

218
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,040
And, what happens after?

219
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,294
- You'll get another 24
when the job is done.

220
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:48,656
- 40,000.

221
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:51,915
- Done.

222
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:57,295
- Damn, I was gonna say 50.

223
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:59,427
- I was prepared to go a hundred.

224
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:01,049
- Damn it.

225
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,616
- Now, do we have a deal?

226
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,548
- This dude, he's a
really bad dude, right?

227
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,835
- Huh, you have no idea.

228
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:15,589
- Hmm. Damn, you really smell good.

229
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,596
- Whatever.

230
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:20,662
Just give me your number, and
I'll send you the details.

231
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:22,641
I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself.

232
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:24,292
I'm Sarah Lee.

233
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,725
- You mean like the, like,
like the cupcake Sarah Lee?

234
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:27,782
Like-

235
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,324
♪ Nobody does ♪
- Yeah.

236
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:30,158
- Oh, okay.

237
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,186
Now, I need details about him.

238
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:35,854
- Are you squinting your eyes?

239
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,688
- No.

240
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,986
Continue.

241
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,067
- Continue with what?

242
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,190
- Details. Like, why do you want 'em gone?

243
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:43,572
Why come you just don't leave 'em?

244
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,503
Are there kids involved?

245
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:45,884
Wife? Folk horn lover?

246
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:46,845
Are we going back to your place?

247
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,436
And, when do you need it done?

248
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,328
- No, we're not going back to my house!

249
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,770
At least, not yet.

250
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:52,611
And, I'm not married.

251
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,447
It's my stupid adopted brother.

252
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:58,021
- So, you're saying there's a chance.

253
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,405
Anyway, so, why do you
really wanna get rid of him?

254
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:06,394
- Aside from the fact that
he's a travesty to humanity,

255
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:07,926
trying to take what's mine?

256
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,828
He's a loser with the loser job.

257
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,289
- Yeah, what does he do for work?

258
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,241
- He's an Uber driver!

259
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:14,923
- Well, I mean, that's a
great career opportunity.

260
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:16,154
They're growing in a lot of cities.

261
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,166
So, what do you do for work?

262
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,848
- I'm a plastic surgeon.

263
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,190
- He should step his game up a bit.

264
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,301
What else?

265
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:25,373
- First off, he's freaking adopted because

266
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,956
my parents thought that
they couldn't have kids.

267
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,668
But then, God blessed them with me,

268
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,830
their own flesh and blood.

269
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:34,284
And, they still think that
he's the golden child.

270
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,385
I did everything right.

271
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,307
I was an early talker.

272
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,199
I was valedictorian in high school.

273
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:43,812
I graduated cumma sum laude from college.

274
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:45,816
- How do you spell that?
- I got a PhD.

275
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:49,067
I contribute to my 401k.

276
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,530
I floss every day.

277
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:54,082
There was he, who wet the
bed when we were kids,

278
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:56,274
and was afraid of the dark.

279
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:57,746
- I was, too.

280
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,809
- One time, he ran over our family dog!

281
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:01,643
And then-

282
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:03,307
- What? Wh-wh-wh-what?

283
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,141
- Yes!

284
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:04,975
- Wait, hold on!

285
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,394
Let me make sure Pugjin
moves out of the way!

286
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,705
- Stupid Pugjin.

287
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,936
- Pugjin, no!

288
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:15,399
- What?

289
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:16,800
- He hates dogs!

290
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,466
Hates them!

291
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,204
- This guy sounds horrible!

292
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:21,667
- Yeah.

293
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:22,501
Yeah.

294
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:23,602
- You know what? Why can I find him?

295
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,829
- You can start by calling an Uber.

296
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:29,037
There's this group of guys who
hang out in this parking lot.

297
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,599
It's called the Hot Zone.

298
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:33,239
- Text me to Uber Hot Zone information,

299
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,993
and I'll get it done.

300
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:44,943
I got you.

301
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:47,720
You do smell good, though.

302
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,710
- Come on, Chester!

303
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,484
You got this!

304
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,596
You know what?

305
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:48,947
You got the money.

306
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,684
It'll definitely get you outta debt.

307
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,267
And, I'ma do this for Lois Lane.

308
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,931
Yes!

309
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:02,680
You know what?

310
00:17:02,682 --> 00:17:04,134
How hard is it to kill someone?

311
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,524
I mean, they do it on Game
of Thrones all the time.

312
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,500
I could be like the black Arya Stark!

313
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:13,538
Take that, Ice King!

314
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,223
Hello?

315
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,057
- Hi neighbor.

316
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,559
I was wondering if you had
any aspirin I could borrow?

317
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,657
Hi! Sorry to bother you.

318
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,968
I was wondering if you had any aspirin?

319
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,071
I just ran out.

320
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,683
Sorry, I'm Tasha.

321
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,619
From apartment B.

322
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:49,573
The aspirin?

323
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,507
Huh? What? Huh-

324
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,340
- Aspirin?
- Oh, aspirin!

325
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:54,174
- Do you have any?

326
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,008
- Yes!

327
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,159
Yes, yes!

328
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:58,230
Damn it!

329
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,659
Sorry.

330
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:02,490
Sorry. Do you wanna come in?

331
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:04,172
I, so I don't slam door
on your face again?

332
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,006
- Sure.

333
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:06,383
- Okay, here we go.

334
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,475
Okay.

335
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,521
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

336
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:09,354
- Oop, there it goes again.

337
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,188
- I almost did it again.

338
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,022
- Thanks.
- Yeah, come on in.

339
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,013
- Oh, I love your shirt.

340
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,294
- Oh, thanks.

341
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:15,607
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

342
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,506
- So, how long you've been living here?

343
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:19,728
- Uh, about two and a half, three years.

344
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,562
And you?

345
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:23,031
- Oh, I moved in about six months ago.

346
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,863
- Actually, it was about
five months, four days,

347
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:26,995
three hours, 26 minutes, and 37 seconds.

348
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,136
But who's actually counting?

349
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,187
Not me.

350
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:30,387
- Say what?

351
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,821
- Oh, I was just counting the aspirin out.

352
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,275
How many I should give you.

353
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:36,154
I mean, how many you should take.

354
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,376
You should inject, or I should feed you?

355
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,989
I mean, so you don't
have to go to the store.

356
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,340
- Okay, great.

357
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:43,176
Thanks.

358
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:48,496
Wow, that's, that's different.

359
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:49,337
Are you in the medical field?

360
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,569
- Oh, no.

361
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:51,710
My sister's a nurse.

362
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,241
So, when we would get sick,

363
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:55,373
she would give us aspirin like this.

364
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,459
Kinda become a habit.

365
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:59,157
You want eight?

366
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,268
- Yeah, that's fine.

367
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,102
Thank you.

368
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:01,938
- You got it.

369
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,905
- Oh, wow!

370
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,849
You should be careful leaving
money like that laying around.

371
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,680
- Oh, oh, yeah.

372
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,632
That's, that's my advance.

373
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:17,235
I'm a, I'm a writer, so
gotta get to the bank.

374
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:18,857
- Cool! A writer? Wow!

375
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,088
So, do you write books or movies?

376
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,530
- Movies. Movies.

377
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:24,442
Um, you know, researching a character now,

378
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,536
just taking notes, getting
as much information

379
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:28,917
about the character as possible.

380
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,959
- You know what, that's a good writer.

381
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,971
You know, really digging
into the character,

382
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,944
and finding out all those
good traits, and bad traits.

383
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:36,905
- Exactly.

384
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:38,767
- Cool. Well you know what?

385
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,208
I know you're gonna kill it.

386
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,044
I could tell.

387
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,391
- I hope so.

388
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:45,379
- Well, thank you so much again.

389
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:46,213
- You're welcome.

390
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,047
- And, if there's anything you ever need,

391
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:48,369
please let me know.

392
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,427
- Okay.

393
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,139
- I would love to pay you back.

394
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:54,292
And, you know, maybe I can
have you on my podcast,

395
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,944
make an appearance
after your book is done.

396
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,466
- Yeah. Um, sure thing. Yeah.

397
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,390
- Okay, great.

398
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,770
- Oh, and I'm Chester.

399
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:02,606
- I know.

400
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,633
- You do?

401
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:06,716
- Bye.

402
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,848
- Hell, yes!

403
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,424
What the-

404
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:15,093
- Are you okay?

405
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,291
- Yep.

406
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:17,313
- All right.

407
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,901
- I'm well. I'm good. Trust me.

408
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:23,331
Okay. Chester, you got two options.

409
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,214
Long sleeve. More menacing.

410
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:27,298
Ooh, I like that.

411
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,448
Ooh. And then short sleeve, kind of cruel.

412
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,779
Hey, how you doing?

413
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:34,150
Stay in character! Stay in character!

414
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:34,984
Stay in character!

415
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,503
What's your name?

416
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:37,800
It doesn't matter.

417
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,473
You're not gonna make it through the day.

418
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,287
Oh!

419
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,539
Short sleeve? Long sleeve?

420
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,712
Short sleeve? Long sleeve?

421
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:45,548
That's it.

422
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:49,020
Let's get 'em!

423
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:50,660
Oh, long sleeve? No!

424
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:53,087
Short sleeve! Short sleeve.

425
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:57,297
What did she say his name was again?

426
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,869
Hmm, Tyrone.

427
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:04,172
Well, how am I gonna
find a Tyrone in this-

428
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:05,734
Brothers.

429
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:06,568
Bingo.

430
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,401
Got you.

431
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:09,998
- So yeah, I was over there
at the Cuyhanga Beanery,

432
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,001
and this guy just kept on bugging me.

433
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,725
I was like, man, this is too much!

434
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:15,715
- You opened the door for them, too?

435
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:16,549
- I had to open the-

436
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:17,445
- Excuse me, guys.

437
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:18,587
- Yep, yep, yep.

438
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,647
- Excuse me.

439
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,930
- This guy just kept on annoying me.

440
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:22,819
- Excuse me.

441
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:23,653
Sorry to interrupt.

442
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:24,486
- Sorry I need to go to the airport.

443
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,385
I'm like, where the hell you going?

444
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,676
You know, he just kept on
buttin' in my conversation, and-

445
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:31,689
- Pardon me, guys. Excuse me.

446
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,523
- And I just- What!

447
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,357
- Oh!
- What? What? What?

448
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,567
What?

449
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,232
- I'm, I'm looking for Tyrone.

450
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:39,157
Are you Tyrone?

451
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:39,993
- What?

452
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:45,601
Just because we're black,
don't mean I'm no damn Tyrone!

453
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,875
What the hell's wrong with you?

454
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:47,896
- That's racist.

455
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:48,730
- Very.

456
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:50,295
- Oh, no. That's not what-

457
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:51,439
- Man, get the hell outta here!

458
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:53,181
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean, you-

459
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,322
- You can leave now.

460
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:55,601
- Oh.

461
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:56,905
- Bye.

462
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:57,986
Adios.

463
00:21:57,988 --> 00:21:58,977
Au revoir.

464
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:00,809
Ciao! Beat it!

465
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:03,006
Get the hell outta here!

466
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:11,102
I'm just messing with you, man.

467
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:13,692
Yes.

468
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:14,773
I'm Fred!

469
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,304
- Hey. Chester.
- Hey, man!

470
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:17,506
Chester.

471
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:18,436
What a name.

472
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,968
Uh, this is Kyle.

473
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,091
Uh, and Tyrone is,

474
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:23,925
over there.

475
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:24,761
Yo, Tyrone!

476
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,053
- That's your boy.

477
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,578
I know, I know.

478
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,349
I wouldn't trust him.

479
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,366
His name is Tyrone, and he's Asian.

480
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:35,579
Yeah.

481
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:38,429
- Thanks, guys.

482
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:39,758
- Yeah.

483
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,024
Don't eat the noodles.

484
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,064
- Oh, hi Chester.

485
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,106
Going to Camarillo, huh?

486
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:48,940
- Yep.

487
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:49,774
- Oh, that's a hike.

488
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:51,505
But, I'm glad you chose me.

489
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:52,493
Ump.

490
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:53,932
People would kill to get this gig.

491
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:54,766
- Yeah?

492
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:55,600
- Yeah.

493
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:56,433
Oh, man.

494
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:59,788
This is like a $50, $60 fare.

495
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,349
That's high request.

496
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,512
I'm the lucky one, heh-heh.

497
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:05,163
Hey, you like rap music?

498
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:05,997
- No, not really.

499
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,355
I, I mean, it's cool.

500
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:08,617
- I love it. You know?

501
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,280
Oh, I love, uh, Dr. Dre, LL Cool J,

502
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,382
you know, Eminem, Snoop Dog!

503
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:16,424
Wu-Tang!

504
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:17,445
They're killing it.

505
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:19,153
- Man, they're really good.

506
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:19,987
- Yeah, I usually-

507
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:22,352

- Huh. Cool.

511
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:27,823

512
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,418
You only listen to rap so much a day.

513
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,530
You know what I mean?

514
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:32,886
- So why'd you have it on?

515
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,214
- Well, you know, in
training they say that,

516
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,436
uh, you know, you should play the most

517
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:40,629
popular music according to your rider.

518
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,572
And, uh, I've been getting a lot of, uh,

519
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:47,596
black brothers requests today, and, um-

520
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:51,212
- He says things that make
me wanna knock his head off!

521
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:52,581
I mean, you know he's trying to adapt.

522
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,572
But, ugh!

523
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:55,524
- You do know that's racist, right?

524
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:56,359
- Is it really?

525
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:58,302
- Yeah.

526
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,788
- Oh, well, my bad, Homes!

527
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,849
- And that.

528
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:03,481
- True. True that.

529
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,983
- That also.

530
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,935
Hey, Tyrone, you know what?

531
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:07,809
Why don't you just be you?

532
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:09,162
It's probably better.

533
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:11,613
- You're right.

534
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,448
Um-

535
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,043
I'm sorry, like, uh,

536
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:15,877
if I offended you,

537
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,196
like, I apologize.

538
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,668
- No, that's cool.

539
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,771
- How would you do it?

540
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:26,694
- I think I'ma get to know him first.

541
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:28,707
- Why?

542
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:30,779
- So, what's your story?

543
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,310
Every Uber driver has a story.

544
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:33,902
You married? Going to school?

545
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:36,875
Gay? Struggling hip-hop artist?

546
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,127
- Nah, no, none of the above.

547
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,130
I'm, uh, actually just starting
out to become an actor.

548
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:43,692
- Oh.
- Yeah.

549
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:46,785
I know it's a little bit late
in the game, but, you know,

550
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:49,715
like they say, "It's never
too late, until you're dead".

551
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,641
- I don't think that's a saying.

552
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:55,644
- I'm single, and I'm ready to mingle.

553
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:56,695
Yeah.

554
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,797
- I mean, do you have
any family, or anything?

555
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,631
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

556
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:02,010
I got, uh, my grandparents, you know,

557
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:03,091
they're getting up there in age.

558
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:05,884
And my, my parents live
nearby, and I got a sister.

559
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:06,965
She's pretty cool.

560
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,737
And, she thinks I look like, uh-

561
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:09,571
- Broke ass.

562
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:10,707
- Jackie Chan!

563
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,662
- Um.

564
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:15,974
- Yeah, she's, she's not
too keen on the whole,

565
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:17,871
uh, Uber thing, but-

566
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,149
She doesn't understand the
opportunities, you know,

567
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,121
and the flexibility for auditions.

568
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,112
- Yeah, that's true.

569
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:25,524
You get a lot of auditions?

570
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,665
- No.

571
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:29,968
But, you know, it's a
numbers game.

572
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,804
So-

573
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,602
- Yeah.

574
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:34,816
And, you got a point there.

575
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,665
I mean, have you booked any gigs?

576
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,499
Anything?

577
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:38,332
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!

578
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh, I had an industrial
commercial for Tampax.

579
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,133
It was good.

580
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,266
You know, I made a little
money, so, you know,

581
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:47,896
I got my Sag card last
year, which is our union,

582
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:49,578
so I think it's gonna be a good year.

583
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,980
- He likes to pick his ears
in the middle of talking,

584
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:53,156
cause he's excited.

585
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,764
- There's nothing wrong with that.

586
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,265
- It's disgusting.

587
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:58,647
- Agreed.

588
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,252
- What about you?

589
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,349
What, what do you do?

590
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,533
- Well, me, I'm, huh, I'm
in business for myself,

591
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:06,287
so I dabble in a little bit of this,

592
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,046
a little bit of that, you know?

593
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:10,685
I'm actually doing research as we speak.

594
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:12,656
- Cool, heh-heh-heh.

595
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:13,932
Research.

596
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:16,845
I bet you're really good
at what you do, heh-heh.

597
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,226
- It's, it's a new process.

598
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,118
Um, I'm still trying to see if I like it.

599
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,833
- Oh, you're gonna be great.

600
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:23,812
I'm, I'm pulling for you, Chester.

601
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,223
I know you're gonna be awesome.

602
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:26,057
- Thanks?

603
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,037
- No doubt about it.

604
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,268
Oh! Oh, sweet!

605
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,950
- What? You all right?

606
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:32,938
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh.

607
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,772
Oh, sorry.

608
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:35,854
I just got a notification
for tee time this Friday

609
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:38,677
at this course I've
been wanting to play at.

610
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:39,513
- Wait.

611
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:42,551
You play golf?

612
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:43,817
- I really love the game.

613
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:48,256
- That's funny, because
I love the game, also.

614
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,028
- Shut the front door,
and take off your shoes!

615
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,050
No way!

616
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:51,884
- Yeah.
- No way!

617
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:53,014
- Yeah.
- No way!

618
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:53,848
- Yeah! Ya!

619
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,193
- How long have you been playin'?

620
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,716
- I've been playing for about,
what, four to five years now.

621
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:58,550
- What's your handicap?

622
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,839
- I'm about a 14, 12
on a good day, though.

623
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:01,972
- Wow.

624
00:27:01,974 --> 00:27:04,232
- But I cannot chip to
save my life, at all.

625
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:05,433
- That's my forte!
- What?

626
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:07,248
- Forte!
- I can drive it.

627
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,082
- Good.

628
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,268
Cause I can drive it like Shaq!

629
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,349
Maybe we can help each other?

630
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:12,183
- Yeah.

631
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:13,017
- That'll be cool.

632
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:14,994
- On three, who's your
favorite player? 1, 2, 3-

633
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:15,835
Bubba Watson!

634
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:18,987
Really?

635
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:19,823
Dude!

636
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:21,860
- We should, we should definitely play.

637
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:23,091
- Oh, man, Tyrone.

638
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,022
Yeah, that'll be cool.

639
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:25,824
- Yeah!
- That'll be really cool.

640
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:27,836
- That'd be awesome!

641
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:28,670
- You know what?

642
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:29,797
Thanks, Tyrone.

643
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,560
You're a really good Uber driver.

644
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,481
I'm gonna give you five stars.

645
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:34,337
Five.

646
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,304
- Wow.

647
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:37,140
Oh, here.

648
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:40,779
You know, hit me up if you
wanna play some golf sometime.

649
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:43,156
- I like it.

650
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,163
Hey, man.

651
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,374
Thanks again.

652
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:47,227
- You too, homie.

653
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,864
Too soon, huh?

654
00:27:51,742 --> 00:27:52,576
- Yeah.

655
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,760
- What the hell am I
gonna do in Camarillo?

656
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:03,331
Damn!

657
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,683
Gotta call another Uber?

658
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,346
That's $150.

659
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:07,182
Camarillo.

660
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,384
- Yo, Chester!

661
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,547
- Damn it! The devil.

662
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,905
Hey. What's up, Devil Breath?

663
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:18,677
I mean, Darren Breaks?

664
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,860
- What did I tell you about
using my full government name?

665
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:23,692
- That's the only thing your saucy about?

666
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:24,526
Look.

667
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,914
Anyway, what's going on?

668
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,746
- Your rents late.

669
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,410
Again.

670
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:30,244
And,

671
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:33,211
I saw Tasha in your crib!

672
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,193
You know, that's my girl!

673
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:37,686
- Dude, you guys went on one
date, and then she ghosted you.

674
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:38,917
Plus, Lois Lane needs surgery, so-

675
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:39,753
- So?

676
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:44,743
And Tasha, shouldn't be in
your crib, for any reason.

677
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:47,325
- Wow. I didn't know she
unghosted you that quick.

678
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,406
Now, that's fast.

679
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:51,162
Like, from that to that. Wow.

680
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,391
- Well, I, you, well, you look-

681
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,106
- What?
- Well-

682
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,359
- Just, say it.

683
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,707
- Stay away!

684
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,407
I'm not telling you again.

685
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,168
- Oh!

686
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,147
Aww!

687
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,983
- Ugh!
- Uh.

688
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:05,859
- Jesus!

689
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:07,977
- Ugh!

690
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,400
You do know that's how
they killed Houdini, right?

691
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:13,091
- Everybody knows that!

692
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:14,953
Now, you look.

693
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:16,695
Stay away from her.

694
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:19,067
Don't make me have to tell you again.

695
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:22,796
And, your rent needs to be
here by the end of next week.

696
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:25,276
Yes.

697
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:26,112
- Okay.

698
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,258
- Uh-huh.

699
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:34,838
- Okay. I got it.

700
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:38,516
Ugh.

701
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:04,956
- Hey!

702
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,279
- Wow. He's excited.

703
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:12,581
- Bro! Uh, dude!

704
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,576
I'm so excited you can make it!

705
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,154
I was actually just dropping the kids off

706
00:30:16,156 --> 00:30:17,235
at the pool when you texted.

707
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,436
- I'm excited, too.

708
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:19,899
Wait.

709
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,379
Thought you didn't have any kids?

710
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:22,370
- Oh, I don't.

711
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:24,775
I was, uh, taking the
Brown's to the Super Bowl.

712
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:27,475
Their vacation.

713
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:29,252
- Oh.
- Let's go.

714
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:31,972
- Guess I stepped into that.

715
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:34,060
Excited.

716
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,103
- Man, look at us.

717
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:37,174
Look like, "Reservoir Dogs".

718
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:57,566
- Keep left! Keep left!

719
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:59,184
- Hit it!

720
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:11,369
- Uh!
- Oh!

721
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:22,911
- You see it?

722
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:24,412
- Nope.

723
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:25,516
You gotta take a drop.

724
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,131
- Let me go get it.

725
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,114
Let me go get it!

726
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:51,770
- Ah.

727
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:52,604
- Cool.

728
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:53,812
Nice shot.

729
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:54,646
- You know?

730
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:55,672
- Wow.

731
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,000
Hello?

732
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,238
- Hey, where are you?

733
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,139
- Who's this?

734
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:02,701
- You know who this is.

735
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:03,812
It's Sarah.

736
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,485
- Who? Oh, hey!

737
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,038
How, how you doing?

738
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,647
- I'm good.

739
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:10,814
But, it doesn't matter how I'm doing.

740
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,983
Have you figured out
when this will be done?

741
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:15,817
- Yeah.

742
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,085
I'm just gathering a lot more info.

743
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:19,067
Um, you know what?

744
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,118
You might wanna reconsider.

745
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,600
He's actually a nice guy.

746
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:25,108
- Well, that isn't for
you to decide, is it?

747
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:28,532
I need to know when you
think this will be done.

748
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:34,713
Are you, laughing?

749
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:35,798
- No.

750
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,025
I, I, I sneezed.

751
00:32:37,027 --> 00:32:38,917
- Oh, well.

752
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,178
Bless you.

753
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,439
- Oh, bless you, too.

754
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:42,273
I mean, thank you.

755
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:43,241
You know what?

756
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,996
Gimme a couple of more days,
and it, and it'll be done.

757
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,587
- Fine.

758
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:51,469
Just, uh, keep me posted.

759
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,305
- Will do.

760
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,135
- Dude!

761
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,824
What a shot!

762
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:56,864
- I know!

763
00:32:57,748 --> 00:32:59,007
- Yeah, man.

764
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,229
- No.

765
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,063
- It's a saga.

766
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:01,897
- No. There is no way.

767
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:02,851
- Sa-ga.

768
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:03,685
- Dude.

769
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,223
I can't believe you think
Twilight was a great movie.

770
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,244
It was awful.

771
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:07,408
- No, it wasn't!

772
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:10,989
Look, if I'm gonna be honest,
I'm Team Edwards, all the way.

773
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:11,920
- No, no, no, no, no.

774
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:13,001
Team Jacob.

775
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:14,503
You get to turn into a wolf.

776
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:16,159
Chicks dig wolves.

777
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,406
And, plus Enesree, in that last one.

778
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:20,539
Wow, she was dope!

779
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,490
- Uh, I don't know.

780
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:23,894
First one was pretty killer.

781
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,337
So, Chester, what is
it that you do anyway?

782
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,289
I know you say this and that,
but I mean, that's like,

783
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,551
you know, what is calculus?

784
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,082
It's just a bunch of numbers.

785
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:35,338
Come on.

786
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,191
- I mean, I'm, I-

787
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,397
I'm doing a challenging project right now,

788
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:42,070
and, I don't know if I can do it.

789
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:43,473
I thought it'd be easy, but-

790
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:46,755
It's tougher than I thought.

791
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:47,656
- Like, at the end of the day,

792
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,698
I think if you truly believe in yourself,

793
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,659
you can do anything.

794
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,494
So-

795
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,052
You know?

796
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:55,018
You'll get it done.

797
00:33:58,018 --> 00:33:58,852
- We'll see.

798
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,121
Hey, I would like to see
some of your work, Ty.

799
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:04,593
- Really?

800
00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:05,428
- Yeah.

801
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:09,788
- Hey, you just call me Ty?

802
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,624
- Yeah, I mean,

803
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,607
I like Tyrone, but Ty is cool.

804
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:16,459
- Thanks man.

805
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:20,035
Hey, uh, I got the student
film I can show you, but,

806
00:34:20,037 --> 00:34:23,833
you know, it's, it's okay.

807
00:34:23,835 --> 00:34:24,667
Just don't make fun of me.

808
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:27,180
But, uh, you gotta pay
your dues, huh, brother?

809
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,896
- It's cool, brother.

810
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:36,247
It's cool like that brother.

811
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:45,096
- Look, I'm not hurting anymore!

812
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:46,668
All right?

813
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,589
I'm not hurting anyone!

814
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,934
I'm a good person!

815
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:56,214
- Aww, he's such a good guy.

816
00:34:56,216 --> 00:34:57,716
- Is this for everyone?

817
00:34:57,718 --> 00:35:01,834
- Oh, he's a really good guy.

818
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:05,261
Why did I agree to this? Why?

819
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:16,309
Hey.

820
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:17,536
- What the Freddie Krueger!

821
00:35:17,538 --> 00:35:18,527
- Why am I here?

822
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:20,418
I have a lady's face
hanging off, and I told 'em

823
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,519
I needed to get a new
face graft from the lab.

824
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,610
- Yeah, I have no idea what that is.

825
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:26,334
- I know you don't, I barely do!

826
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,566
Now, why am I here?

827
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:30,268
- Look, I- I can't do this.

828
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,100
He's a really great guy.

829
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,692
I mean, maybe if you two talked, you know,

830
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:35,043
it would make things better?

831
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,154
He's your brother!

832
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:37,205
- Adopted brother.

833
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:39,309
And, I don't want him to take what's mine.

834
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,409
You know what?

835
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:42,400
Fine.

836
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:43,847
Did you bring my money?

837
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:51,464
- Devil Breath!

838
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,467
- Yeah.

839
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:57,470
Here you go.

840
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,685
I'm a little light.

841
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:07,373
- Are you kidding me?

842
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,950
- Look, I'm, I'm sorry.

843
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:11,109
I, I'll get you the other
11,000 when I, you know,

844
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:13,121
when I sell my next script or something.

845
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:14,607
Just gimme a minute.

846
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,381
- Oh!

847
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:28,767
- Please, please don't
make me have to see him.

848
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,293
I can't get hit again!

849
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:33,927
Or else he'll continue to
treat me like I'm trash!

850
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:35,819
- What?

851
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:40,629
- I didn't want to start off with that.

852
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,482
I didn't think it would come to this!

853
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:46,820
Behind closed doors, he's a monster.

854
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,132
With his kids, it was worse.

855
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,685
He used to abuse me.

856
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:54,525
- Tyrone.

857
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:56,452
Hey, Tyrone.

858
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,177
- What!

859
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:03,181
- Goodness! He seems like such a nice guy.

860
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,017
- Yeah.

861
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:07,672
That's what everyone thinks.

862
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:09,175
And it's always been horrible.

863
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,036
And when he started
Ubering, it only got worse!

864
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:16,520
- Well, I mean, those
are some tough hours.

865
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:18,737
- I can't tell our parents,

866
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,294
because he's the golden
child in their eyes.

867
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:23,483
They'll never see it.

868
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,094
He plays them, and uses 'em

869
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,961
better than you could ever imagine.

870
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,874
He's a true monster.

871
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,623
You know what?

872
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:40,094
You can owe me rest of the money

873
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:41,164
when you finish your script.

874
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:43,632
- Wait!

875
00:37:43,634 --> 00:37:44,467
Wait.

876
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:47,706
I'll do it.

877
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,617
I, I'll get it done.

878
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:50,105
Just gimme a couple days.

879
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:51,047
- No, it's okay.

880
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:51,881
You don't have to.

881
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:52,715
I'll be all right.

882
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:53,551
- No, no, no.

883
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:56,670
I got you, sister girl.

884
00:37:57,928 --> 00:37:58,776
I got you.

885
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:06,006
Um!

886
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,581
Um?

887
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,471
Um!

888
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:12,469
Oh, you smell wonder-

889
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:13,305
Oop!

890
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:15,605
- Thank you.

891
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:38,306
- Come on, Chessy-chess.

892
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:39,765
No, no, not yet.

893
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:42,511
Not yet.

894
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:43,992
God.

895
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:45,223
What are you gonna do?

896
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:46,908
What are you gonna do?

897
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,742
He's not a good dude.

898
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:48,797
He's just, he's not a good dude.

899
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:50,148
She said "He's not a good dude".

900
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,982
But, on the other hand,

901
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:52,671
he won't hurt to fly.

902
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:54,262
I feel that.

903
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,815
But, that's the mark of a good actor.

904
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:57,746
Oh!

905
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,663
He's playing you.

906
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:01,153
He's playing you, Chester.

907
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:02,657
Man, ain't anybody playing me?

908
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:04,935
I ain't getting played.

909
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:10,664
If you don't kill him, you gotta tell him.

910
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:14,588
- Oh, you think I'm playing, huh?

911
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,725
You'll do as I say, or I'm
gonna rip your face off

912
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:17,828
with these vice grips!

913
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,530
You know my reach goes beyond a jail cell!

914
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:23,962
I will kill you, and
your whole damn family!

915
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:25,456
You got that?

916
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,778
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

917
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,524
Oh, oh. Nope. Nope.

918
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:29,609
Oh, sorry.

919
00:39:34,027 --> 00:39:34,859
Oh!

920
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:35,693
- Chester.

921
00:39:35,695 --> 00:39:36,527
- Hey!

922
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:38,409
- Your early.
- Yeah.

923
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:39,818
- Come on in!

924
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,652
Quit being out there.

925
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:42,015
It's so hot out there.

926
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:42,849
Come on, let's go.

927
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:43,984
Come on!

928
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:49,187
Want a PB&J sandwich?

929
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:50,600
- No, uh, uh, I'm okay.

930
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:51,433
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

931
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:53,151
- Just, I started one for you.

932
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,560
- That's okay.

933
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:55,854
- Okay. Screw yourself.

934
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,055
I get kind of hungry.

935
00:39:57,057 --> 00:39:58,148
Glad your here.

936
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,202
I was just making snacks later, you know?

937
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,493
I always make myself a lot of snacks.

938
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:08,827
Take to the golf course
since I get so hungry.

939
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:10,148
You need to have snacks handy.

940
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,826
Otherwise I just, go hypoglycemic.

941
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,463
Uh, I got your message about, uh,

942
00:40:15,465 --> 00:40:18,286
you needed to talk to me about something?

943
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:19,222
You wanna, um-

944
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,577
Before I forget, can
I ask you for a favor?

945
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:28,589
- Did you get a, a new nine iron?

946
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,070
- Yeah, like, last month.

947
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:33,724
Along with the rest of the clubs.

948
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,249
- Cool. Cool.

949
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,141
- Hey.

950
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:40,975
Can you help me out?

951
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:42,460
I need to learn lines.

952
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:44,425
I got an audition next week, and,

953
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:45,919
I still need to be off book.

954
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:47,739
- Huh?

955
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:50,148
- Before you came in, I was
running my lines, right?

956
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,761
And I, it's just, not in my wheelhouse.

957
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:53,632
It's this gangster type,

958
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:55,428
and that's not really my strong suit.

959
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:57,895
- Oh.

960
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:00,028
So, you were going over your lines?

961
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,864
- Yeah.

962
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,391
- Well, yes.

963
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:04,598
Yes, I can help you.

964
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:06,965
- Good man.

965
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:07,901
I appreciate you.

966
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:10,148
I'm gonna go pee now.

967
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,982
- Okay.

968
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:11,816
- It's a long drive.

969
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:13,016
- Okay.

970
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,854
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

971
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:20,361
Whew! See?

972
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:21,775
He's not a bad dude.

973
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,364
So, you gotta tell him.

974
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:26,873
Damn it!

975
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,836
I can't.

976
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:28,672
You know what?

977
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:30,890
I will.

978
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:32,736
I will tell him.

979
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:35,739
- Whew! So What are you gonna tell me?

980
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:40,418
Ooh!

981
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,917
I know.

982
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:42,751
- You do?

983
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:44,651
- Um-hmm, I know.

984
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:45,486
I know.

985
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:49,938
You, are still too afraid

986
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,040
to ask your neighbor out, aren't you?

987
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,695
- No. Yeah. No. What?

988
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:54,529
- Hmm?
- No.

989
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:56,121
- Huh?
- It's my-

990
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,145
Y-yes!

991
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,157
Yes. But, you know what?

992
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,719
It's my idiot landlord.

993
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,791
Every time I go to knock
on her door, or whatever,

994
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:03,625
it's like he's there.

995
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:05,554
It's like, bam, he pops
in-and-out a nowhere.

996
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,265
I, I don't know what to do.

997
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:08,729
He's so in my game.

998
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:11,673
- Hm.

999
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:15,461
Maybe it's time we teach him a lesson.

1000
00:42:15,463 --> 00:42:17,716
- S-s-s, if you say so. He's a big dude.

1001
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:19,487
- I'm very Asian.

1002
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:20,629
You see these eyes?

1003
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:21,462
- Hmm.

1004
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:22,296
- Very Asian.

1005
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:23,326
- What?

1006
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:24,838
- Use that to my advantage.

1007
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,672
- What?

1008
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:28,767
- You know, people say, that
Asian people know martial arts,

1009
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:30,784
Kung Fu, Karate, TaeKwonDo.

1010
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,181
Mitsubishi.

1011
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,598
So, they're scared of us.

1012
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,845
Proven fact.

1013
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,016
- That's racist.

1014
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:40,418
- But it's still a fact. A racist fact.

1015
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,947
- Eh.
- Eh?

1016
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:42,911
- Eh.
- Eh?

1017
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:43,745
- Yeah.
- Eh.

1018
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:45,118
But, you got me though, right?

1019
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,952
You know what I'm saying?

1020
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,235
- All right. Shoot. I'm game.

1021
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:48,069
- Good?

1022
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:48,903
- Let's do it.

1023
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:49,737
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1024
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,395
- Cool!

1025
00:42:51,397 --> 00:42:52,907
Take this.

1026
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:53,827
- Let's go.

1027
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:58,644
- Ah, that's my chip holder.

1028
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,980
Okay, let's try knocking on her door.

1029
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:02,814
- Yeah.

1030
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:05,343
I'm telling you, every time
I go, it's like clockwork.

1031
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:06,755
He's there.

1032
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:08,261
- Okay, let's do it.

1033
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:13,737
- Whew.

1034
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,463
- Hey!
- Okay.

1035
00:43:15,465 --> 00:43:17,896
Dang, I hate when I'm right!

1036
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:19,388
- Remember me?

1037
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:25,589
Get over here!

1038
00:43:27,057 --> 00:43:27,891
Boy!

1039
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,874
Now,

1040
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:33,757
what did I tell you?

1041
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:37,205
- Bring mints next time I see you?

1042
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:38,166
- Stay

1043
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:39,067
away

1044
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:40,659
from my girl!

1045
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,070
- Your, your girl?

1046
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:44,637
- Yeah, my girl!

1047
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:45,470
- Are you sure?

1048
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:46,306
- Huh.

1049
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:48,892
Listen here, little man.

1050
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,971
Stay away from my woman!

1051
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:55,343
If I have to tell you again,

1052
00:43:55,345 --> 00:43:58,171
I'm gonna stuff you in
that trash compactor!

1053
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,460
- Well, I mean this is
a free country, with

1054
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:05,584
freedom of speech, and freedom
to roam, and everything, so-

1055
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,226
- No, it's not!

1056
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,878
Know your history.

1057
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,190
- Yes, it is. Know your history.

1058
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,675
- Oh, you wanna get mouthy, huh?

1059
00:44:14,677 --> 00:44:15,512
- Ehh!

1060
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:16,345
- Is that what you want?

1061
00:44:16,347 --> 00:44:17,179
- No, dude!

1062
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,013
- Huh?

1063
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:18,847
- Hey!

1064
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:22,190
- What is that uniform?

1065
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,026
- Chester!

1066
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:25,679
Looks like we have a problem.

1067
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,411
- Where'd he get that from?

1068
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:28,245
That's racist.

1069
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:29,675
- Hello, friend.

1070
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,304
It appears you are
holding my pupil hostage.

1071
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,166
Making him late to my class.

1072
00:44:38,168 --> 00:44:40,776
- Is your mouth not matching your words?

1073
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:41,980
- Master Lee,

1074
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,503
does not like to wait

1075
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:46,094
for his students.

1076
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:48,947
So, why don't you let go of the midget?

1077
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,388
- Okay, that was I uncalled for.

1078
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,224
- And we

1079
00:44:52,312 --> 00:44:53,361
can settle this like

1080
00:44:53,363 --> 00:44:54,646
two

1081
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:55,674
grown

1082
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:56,508
men.

1083
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,385
- Oh, okay buddy.

1084
00:44:57,387 --> 00:44:58,887
I don't know.

1085
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,719
Listen, I don't want any trouble.

1086
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:01,553
Really.

1087
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:04,440
Especially not from a sensei, so-

1088
00:45:04,442 --> 00:45:05,483
- Boom-uh! Wuh!

1089
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:08,645
- Allergies.

1090
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:10,068
- Oh. Bless you.

1091
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,381
- Thank you very much.

1092
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:13,562
Now, listen.

1093
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:14,469
- Yes?

1094
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:15,303
- Are you-

1095
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:16,484
Oh! Dragon Breath!

1096
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:20,050
- Told you.

1097
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:21,170
- You!

1098
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,405
You will leave my man alone!

1099
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:35,318
Never bother him again.

1100
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:39,492
If I hear you did not follow my rules,

1101
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,172
I will come back and kick

1102
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:45,223
more than just this bike tire!

1103
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:46,505
Whayoo!

1104
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:48,342
Do you understand?

1105
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,123
- Yeah.

1106
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,221
- Yes, sensei.
- Hmm.

1107
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:53,698
Now get outta here!

1108
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,695
- Uh, oop,

1109
00:45:56,697 --> 00:45:57,631
sorry, sensei.

1110
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,814
- You are forgiven.

1111
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,739
Just this once.

1112
00:46:03,741 --> 00:46:04,790
Whaoah!

1113
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,056
- Dude!

1114
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:09,745
- It was pretty good! Ha!

1115
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:10,747
- What? Dude!

1116
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:11,740
Come on.

1117
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:12,878
- I hurt my leg.

1118
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,712
- Oh. Oh!

1119
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:15,524
- That bike is harder than it looks.

1120
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:17,180
- Dude, that was crazy!

1121
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:19,758
Holy, snap finger!

1122
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,800
Dude, that totally worked!

1123
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:24,503
Yo, you're a good actor.

1124
00:46:24,505 --> 00:46:27,235
Man, you should play bad guys more often.

1125
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:30,058
Wait, what if he would've
punched you in the face?

1126
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,500
- Well, thank God I took
those acting classes.

1127
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:33,151
Cause if not, you were two seconds away

1128
00:46:33,153 --> 00:46:35,387
from being a solo
artist, like Bobby Brown.

1129
00:46:36,223 --> 00:46:37,055
- Look at you!

1130
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:37,889
Hey, you want something to drink?

1131
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,252
- Uh, sure. I'll take some OJ.

1132
00:46:43,423 --> 00:46:45,373
- Um, how bout water?

1133
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,364
- Yeah, that's fine.

1134
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:47,325
Hey, I didn't know you had a dog.

1135
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:48,159
Where is it?

1136
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:49,157
- Oh yeah, she's at the vet.

1137
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,298
Uh, she just has surgery,

1138
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,400
so, they're gonna keep
her for a few weeks.

1139
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:54,131
- Oh, what happened to her?

1140
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:57,235
Hey, Louis Lane.

1141
00:46:57,237 --> 00:46:58,822
What are you doing?

1142
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:00,193
Okay, come here, girl.

1143
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,262
Come on.

1144
00:47:01,264 --> 00:47:02,396
Come on.

1145
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:03,230
Come on.

1146
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,731
Let's not talk about it.

1147
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:13,637
- Sensitive?

1148
00:47:20,152 --> 00:47:21,142
- It's her.

1149
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:24,549
- It's the girl! Talk!

1150
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:25,734
- Oh! What do I do?

1151
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:27,325
- Just put something nice on.

1152
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:28,196
- What?

1153
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:29,217
- You smell like golf?

1154
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:30,051
- I do?

1155
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:30,885
- Yes.

1156
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:32,100
- What? Oh!

1157
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,200
Oh! Okay!

1158
00:47:33,202 --> 00:47:34,803
Whew!

1159
00:47:34,805 --> 00:47:36,334
No. Get, get a better shirt.

1160
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:37,743
- Here, put this on.

1161
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,848
- Oh! Okay. It's a good shirt.

1162
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,001
- I smell like Kung Fu.

1163
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,202
- Hey, Tasha! Hi!

1164
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:45,323
How are you?

1165
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:46,157
- Hey, I'm good.

1166
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,265
I just wanna return to aspirin I borrowed.

1167
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:48,677
- Oh, you don't have to do that.

1168
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,298
People usually don't return aspirin,

1169
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,800
cause that's a little weird.

1170
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,391
- No, silly. It's a new bottle.

1171
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:55,268
- Oh! No. You know what?

1172
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,279
I was kidding.

1173
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:57,113
I was just-

1174
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:57,947
- Okay.

1175
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:58,917
- Yeah, you don't have to do that.

1176
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:02,160
I mean, we, we, um, I usually
don't take aspirin anyway,

1177
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,743
so, it kills brain cells, and
kills people, and, you know,

1178
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:07,175
that's not good for the
environment, and everything.

1179
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,397
You know what, I wasn't trying
to say I was trying to kill-

1180
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:10,679
I wasn't trying to kill you.

1181
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:11,530
- Good thing that I borrowed the aspirin

1182
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:12,363
from you in the first place.

1183
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:13,624
- I know-

1184
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:14,558
Now you're saying you don't take it.

1185
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,391
- Right. But, I was just-

1186
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,225
- I know, I'm messing with you.

1187
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,059
- Okay.

1188
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:19,882
Sorry.

1189
00:48:19,884 --> 00:48:20,718
- You're so silly.

1190
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:22,678
So, uh-

1191
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,561
- Want to go out-
- Want to come in-

1192
00:48:24,563 --> 00:48:25,990
And grab a bite to eat?

1193
00:48:25,992 --> 00:48:26,845
- You know what, you go fir-

1194
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:27,686
Wait.

1195
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:29,367
Did you ask me to grab a bite to eat?

1196
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:31,289
- I did. I did.

1197
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,593
So, are you free tomorrow?

1198
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:35,343
- Tomorrow? Let me check.

1199
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,177
Yes.

1200
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,055
I am.

1201
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:37,889
- Okay.

1202
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:38,723
Stay around, 6:00?

1203
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:40,371
- 6:00. I'll be there-

1204
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:42,141
- Oh, hell no.

1205
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:42,975
- You know what, I'll pick you up.

1206
00:48:42,977 --> 00:48:44,322
Where do you live again?

1207
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:45,163
No, I'm just kidding.

1208
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:45,997
I know you live.

1209
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,106
- You're so silly!

1210
00:48:47,108 --> 00:48:47,940
- Upstairs.

1211
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:48,776
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1212
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:07,531
- Thank you.

1213
00:49:10,293 --> 00:49:12,490
- So, why didn't you ever ask me out?

1214
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,426
Too scared?

1215
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,484
- Who you calling scared? Yes.

1216
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,122
Yes, I was.

1217
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:19,337
I was. Yes.

1218
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:21,469
I have to say, you're
kind of intimidating.

1219
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:23,031
You got your whole podcast show.

1220
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:26,769
You got this, "Don't mess with
me" attitude vibe, sometimes.

1221
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,312
- Wow. Okay.

1222
00:49:30,254 --> 00:49:32,400
You do know you're not
helping yourself, right?

1223
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,908
- Yes. I do.

1224
00:49:35,616 --> 00:49:37,175
- So, how's the writing going?

1225
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:38,827
I wanna get you on my podcast.

1226
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:39,668
- Sure.

1227
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,504
Wait!

1228
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:43,328
How you know I'm a writer?

1229
00:49:44,206 --> 00:49:45,674
- Um, I have my ways.

1230
00:49:45,676 --> 00:49:47,115
- Stalker! Stalker.

1231
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,436
We got a stalker, people, right here.

1232
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:49,270
Stalker.

1233
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:50,509
- Stop!
- Stalker. Looking at you.

1234
00:49:50,511 --> 00:49:51,500
Where? Stalker.

1235
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,842
- You told me at the
apartment the other day.

1236
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:55,433
And plus, you can't say stuff like that.

1237
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:57,115
People already scared of black people.

1238
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:58,136
- True. And, I'm dark, too.

1239
00:49:58,138 --> 00:49:58,970
And I'm dark.

1240
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:00,075
- Yes. Um-hmm.

1241
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:00,909
- Um-hmm.

1242
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:01,743
No, I'm sorry, again.

1243
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:03,602
I just, I just got so much in my mind.

1244
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:05,884
Okay. No stalker, just a
passionate black woman, people.

1245
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:07,566
Just a passionate black woman.

1246
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:08,613
What?

1247
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:10,421
- Eat your tacos and drink
your water. Be quiet.

1248
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:12,927
You'll have the cops rolling up on me.

1249
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:13,761
- I know, right?

1250
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:14,595
Look at him.

1251
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,025
- For your first date?

1252
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:17,859
- Yeah.

1253
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:18,693
Me, leaving like this?

1254
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:20,691
- Um, better than me leaving like that.

1255
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:23,947
That is true.

1256
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:26,318

Let's see what you've
been up to, Mr. Cheerful.

1270
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:31,319
You been way too happy lately.

1271
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,706
And there's a reason why.

1272
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:37,901
Ooh!

It smell nice in here.

1274
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:43,614
Is that candles or is that incense?

1275
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,051
I need to get my place smellin' like this!

1276
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:52,057
Uh, whoa, don't! Focus!

1277
00:51:55,582 --> 00:51:57,250
What are you hiding?

1278
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:16,570
He love that dog!

1279
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,490
Oh, oh, you read? Okay.

1280
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:26,775
Tasha?

1281
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:30,750
What the-

1282
00:52:35,762 --> 00:52:36,596
What!

1283
00:52:38,373 --> 00:52:39,207
Sensei?

1284
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:45,110
- Yo, Tyrone?

1285
00:52:45,112 --> 00:52:46,399
- Yeah, Chester?

1286
00:53:04,454 --> 00:53:06,961
- Marco?

1287
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,542
- Polo!

1288
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:13,602
- Chester!

1289
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:24,628
- Cyanide?

1290
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,201
What!

1291
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:28,982
- Thanks, Chester.

1292
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:43,195
- What!

1293
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:44,865
Ho!

1294
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,390
Ooh-ho!

1295
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:48,797
Ho-ho-ho!

1296
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:50,298
Oh, you stalkin'.

1297
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,355
Oh, you gettin' yo stalk on!

1298
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:54,145
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

1299
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,283
Yeah.

1300
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:57,995
I knew you wasn't Mr. Rogers!

1301
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:00,796
I got yo ass!

1302
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:09,816
- Airball!

1303
00:54:10,946 --> 00:54:12,177
Airball!

1304
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,607
- Game's not over yet.

1305
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:18,076
- It will be when I go to
the bank and cash this check.

1306
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:19,551
Ugh!

1307
00:54:19,553 --> 00:54:20,388
Agh!

1308
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,676
- Ha-ha-ha-ha! Insufficient funds.

1309
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,250
- Hey-

1310
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,301
Hey, man. Hey, hey brother.

1311
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,628
Look, I, um,

1312
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,286
I got something to tell you.

1313
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:39,362
- Yeah?

1314
00:54:39,364 --> 00:54:41,259
What is it you wanna tell me?

1315
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:42,991
You got an H?

1316
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:44,623
Ooh!

1317
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,734
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

1318
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:46,760
Leaving it up there!

1319
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:49,337
Your shot.

1320
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:51,655
So, you wanted to tell me something?

1321
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,707
- You know what?

1322
00:54:58,709 --> 00:54:59,543
Nevermind.

1323
00:55:04,174 --> 00:55:05,223
- Ooh.

1324
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:08,692
Someone's distracted.

1325
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:10,719
All right.

1326
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:12,460
Let's make it easy on you.

1327
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:13,416
Simple layup.

1328
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,959
Ugh! Agh!

1329
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:17,793
- Agh!

1330
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:20,690
- Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-how!

1331
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,492
- Ooh! Look at that.

1332
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:23,766
Material toe.

1333
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:25,693

You know what, that reminds me?

1353
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:01,620
I, I gotta tell you this story.

1354
00:56:01,622 --> 00:56:02,717
I've been mean to tell you this.

1355
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:03,551
Man.

1356
00:56:03,553 --> 00:56:04,835
- So, I turned around
and changed my underwear.

1357
00:56:04,837 --> 00:56:05,669
I mean, come on.

1358
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:07,005
- So, what'd you tell all the people

1359
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:07,923
that you were walking with?

1360
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:09,107
- I told 'em I forgot my homework.

1361
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:10,901
I wasn't gonna tell
'em I sharted my pants!

1362
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:13,354
- Oh, you know, I'm gonna
use this if I ever need it.

1363
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:14,188
- No, no, no.

1364
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,193
You cannot use this.

1365
00:56:15,195 --> 00:56:16,064
You better not tell anyone.

1366
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:17,325
I'm trusting you with my dirty laundry.

1367
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:18,496
Literally, dude.

1368
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:20,088
- Chester.

1369
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:20,924
- What the-

1370
00:56:21,772 --> 00:56:22,646
- Sensei.

1371
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,385
Please forgive me, Sensei,

1372
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,668
I don't mean to overstep my boundaries.

1373
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:30,959
- Derek, what are you talking about?

1374
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:33,752
And, why does your breath
smell like peppermint now?

1375
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:34,833
- He's not who he says he is.

1376
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:38,737
And yes, I just sucked on
three peppermint gummy bears.

1377
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:40,058
- Yeah, I didn't even know they had those.

1378
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,623
But, it's something you
should have done years ago.

1379
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:44,022
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1380
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:46,334
Make all the jokes you want.

1381
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,496
But I know the truth,
and I feel like it's my

1382
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:52,490
civil responsibility
to inform you, Sensei.

1383
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,167
- What are you talking about?

1384
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,494
- Hmm.
- Uh, oop!

1385
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:04,502
- Recognize that handwriting?

1386
00:57:06,496 --> 00:57:08,016
- Where did you get those?

1387
00:57:08,018 --> 00:57:09,397
- From your apartment.

1388
00:57:09,399 --> 00:57:10,231
Duh!

1389
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:11,590
- How'd you get in my apartment?

1390
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:12,933
- I broke in.

1391
00:57:12,935 --> 00:57:14,352
Duh,

1392
00:57:14,354 --> 00:57:15,283
again!

1393
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:16,424
- You're the landlord.

1394
00:57:16,426 --> 00:57:17,928
Why didn't you just use a key?

1395
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:20,989
- Because that's illegal!

1396
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:22,135
Triple duh!

1397
00:57:24,264 --> 00:57:25,644
- Look tight.

1398
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:30,178
- Oh, oh, hoo-hoo! Ha-ha!
This is great! He-he!

1399
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,160
Ah, Tasha, right on time.

1400
00:57:32,162 --> 00:57:34,177
Come, join the party.

1401
00:57:35,105 --> 00:57:38,707
I have something for
you as well, I believe.

1402
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:39,628
Um-hmm.

1403
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,461
- Darren.

1404
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:42,624
Please?

1405
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,019
Don't.

1406
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:47,596
- Heh-heh! Oh, yes. I am.

1407
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:48,431
Oh!

1408
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,469
My lady.

1409
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:53,517
- I'm not your lady.

1410
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,064
- Okay.

1411
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:57,984
Uh, anyway,

1412
00:57:57,986 --> 00:57:58,818
uh-

1413
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,271
Looks like a little someone
has been doing some stalking.

1414
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:05,884
Can anybody say creepy? I can.

1415
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:06,720
Creepy!

1416
00:58:08,138 --> 00:58:10,544
- You've been following
me and taking pictures?

1417
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:13,301
- Look, it's not what you think.

1418
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:15,919
- And you're supposed to, to kill me?

1419
00:58:16,817 --> 00:58:18,196
You're a, you're a hitman?

1420
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:19,938
- Well, n-no.

1421
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,560
- Wha-what?

1422
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:22,941
You're a killer?

1423
00:58:22,943 --> 00:58:25,133
- Whew! A stalker and a hitman.

1424
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,484
Damn, dude, that's rough!

1425
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:27,751
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1426
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,220
- So all this hanging out,
and, and, and taking walks.

1427
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:35,496
This was just to get close
to me so that you can,

1428
00:58:35,498 --> 00:58:36,845
so that you can kill me?

1429
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,679
- No.

1430
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,298
Look, Ty, I like hanging out
with you, and going on walks,

1431
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,130
and you know, walking on the beach,

1432
00:58:42,132 --> 00:58:44,082
and horseback riding in the sunset.

1433
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:45,674
I love doing ping-pong.

1434
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:47,926
I love the cake decorating
class that we took together.

1435
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:49,247
I love tummy sticks.

1436
00:58:49,249 --> 00:58:50,959
No one plays tummy sticks like we do.

1437
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,572
You taught me to chip, and I
try to chip as well as you,

1438
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:54,503
but I can't.

1439
00:58:54,505 --> 00:58:56,094
But I watch a form all the time.

1440
00:58:56,096 --> 00:58:56,928
I like all that.

1441
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,857
I like the things that we do.

1442
00:58:58,859 --> 00:58:59,883
I really do.

1443
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:01,800
- Me too.

1444
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:05,493
But, this stuff, I do-, that's
what I don't understand.

1445
00:59:05,495 --> 00:59:07,776
This doesn't sound fun. Snake bite?

1446
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:09,397
Pool accident?

1447
00:59:09,399 --> 00:59:10,233
Cyanide.

1448
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:12,701
Bee sting?

1449
00:59:12,703 --> 00:59:15,078
I'm allergic to bees. You know this!

1450
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:18,656
- "My Girl"?

1451
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,660
- Are you gay?

1452
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:22,493
- What? What?

1453
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,481
What? No!

1454
00:59:23,483 --> 00:59:24,623
Why would you say that?

1455
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,001
No! Um, no-

1456
00:59:26,003 --> 00:59:27,836
- Eh, I was thinking the same thing.

1457
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:29,247
- Shut up!

1458
00:59:29,249 --> 00:59:31,319
Look. I'm, I'm sorry.

1459
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:33,313
I love hanging out with you.

1460
00:59:33,315 --> 00:59:34,202
An, an, and not in a gay way.

1461
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:35,824
And even if you were
gay, it wouldn't matter.

1462
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:37,295
Cause you're a great dude.

1463
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:39,097
And Tasha, yes.

1464
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:41,800
I took photos of you, but
it's not what you think.

1465
00:59:41,802 --> 00:59:43,121
I can explain the whole thing.

1466
00:59:43,123 --> 00:59:44,875
- Something a creepy man would say.

1467
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,115
- You know what?

1468
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,680
Save it.

1469
00:59:48,682 --> 00:59:50,418
I don't wanna know.

1470
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,980
Thank you.

1471
00:59:51,982 --> 00:59:54,352
- You're welcome. Now, did you wanna-

1472
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:55,188
- Nope.

1473
01:00:07,128 --> 01:00:08,547
- You look tired.

1474
01:00:09,396 --> 01:00:10,947
Look-

1475
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,412
- Oh, Chester.

1476
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:25,644
Well, looks like you are-

1477
01:00:25,646 --> 01:00:26,479
- Ump!

1478
01:00:30,186 --> 01:00:32,272
Stay the hell out of my apartment.

1479
01:01:52,886 --> 01:01:54,470
- I don't need you!

1480
01:01:55,953 --> 01:01:57,622
I don't need anyone!

1481
01:01:59,128 --> 01:01:59,962
Just go!

1482
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:08,218
- That's it!

1483
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:16,545
- Are you gonna order some food?

1484
01:02:16,547 --> 01:02:18,977
Because the tea's not gonna be enough.

1485
01:02:18,979 --> 01:02:20,118
- It's my appetite.

1486
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,289
So, I'll say when it's enough.

1487
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:23,451
And, it's two teas.

1488
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:24,623
- Oh, you can count.

1489
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,154
Great. Two teas.

1490
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:27,536
Not gonna cut it.

1491
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:29,823
Starbucks, right down the street.

1492
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:32,310
- You know what, when my friend comes,

1493
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:33,301
we'll order some food.

1494
01:02:33,303 --> 01:02:34,354
How bout that?

1495
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:35,188
- Good.

1496
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,295
You better, cause I charge
for splitting checks.

1497
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:38,226
- What?
- So don't be cute.

1498
01:02:38,228 --> 01:02:41,049
And I'll add gratuity automatically.

1499
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:41,980
Like, aut-

1500
01:02:41,982 --> 01:02:44,833
Like, automatically.

1501
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:45,944
- What is happening right now?

1502
01:02:45,946 --> 01:02:48,286
I thought Felicity meant happiness.

1503
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:49,247
Geez!

1504
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:01,770
- Hey, there.

1505
01:03:01,772 --> 01:03:02,706
- Hi!

1506
01:03:03,604 --> 01:03:04,653
Are you ready to order?

1507
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,486
- Oh, my goodness.

1508
01:03:05,488 --> 01:03:06,663
He just sat down.

1509
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:07,496
Don't you have some

1510
01:03:07,498 --> 01:03:08,527
ketchup or mustard to marry, or somethin'?

1511
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:11,019
- No, Manager John, or
whatever the poop your name is.

1512
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:11,860
I don't!

1513
01:03:11,862 --> 01:03:14,503
Thanks for checking in. Already did it.

1514
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:15,854
Do you wanna order some food?

1515
01:03:15,856 --> 01:03:16,688
- Yes, sweetheart.

1516
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,106
And sorry about the-

1517
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:19,209
- It's fine.

1518
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:20,043
- Yeah.

1519
01:03:20,045 --> 01:03:20,877
- Oh, my God, please.

1520
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:21,770
Homeless.

1521
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:23,872
- May I please have a
lemonade, the sandwich special,

1522
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:25,283
and some fries, please?

1523
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:26,117
- Of course.

1524
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:27,216
- Thank you.

1525
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:28,050
- Okay.

1526
01:03:28,052 --> 01:03:29,007
- I'm charging you for both teas.

1527
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,809
He ordered a lemonade.

1528
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:31,643
- Can I-

1529
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:33,271
- Both teas!

1530
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:34,172
- Order.

1531
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:35,025
- Is this for me?

1532
01:03:35,905 --> 01:03:38,166
Were you, uh, just gonna
have me drink this,

1533
01:03:38,168 --> 01:03:39,247
and keel over right here?

1534
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,989
Or were you gonna stab me
in the back as I leave?

1535
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:42,941
- What? No!

1536
01:03:42,943 --> 01:03:45,103
Wow! That's a great plan.

1537
01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:46,785
But, I would have to wait
till the poison sets in,

1538
01:03:46,787 --> 01:03:48,106
or I'd have to carry a body out.

1539
01:03:48,108 --> 01:03:49,785
And then, if I did that,
there'd be a witness.

1540
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:51,469
So if I act and there was a
witness, she would've saw,

1541
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:52,911
and I would've been a witness,
so I would have to kill

1542
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,008
the witness, and it would've
been a bloody mess, and-

1543
01:03:55,886 --> 01:03:56,905
You know what? No.

1544
01:03:56,907 --> 01:03:58,316
Forget about it.

1545
01:03:58,318 --> 01:03:59,150
Look, Ty.

1546
01:03:59,152 --> 01:03:59,986
- Tyrone.

1547
01:04:01,862 --> 01:04:05,734
- Tyrone. I asked you here
cause I wanted to apologize.

1548
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:07,566
- Apologize for what? For being a liar?

1549
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:09,870
Trying to kill me? Or
being a total fart-neck?

1550
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,542
- I wanted to apologize
for trying to kill you.

1551
01:04:13,544 --> 01:04:14,745
I wasn't gonna kill you.

1552
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:17,210
- Did you think about it?

1553
01:04:17,212 --> 01:04:18,044
- Well?

1554
01:04:18,046 --> 01:04:19,758
To be honest, I thought
about a lot of crazy things,

1555
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,500
and I needed money.

1556
01:04:21,502 --> 01:04:22,335
- Did you?

1557
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:25,458
- I did.

1558
01:04:28,228 --> 01:04:31,234
But, when I met you, it just
confirmed what I thought.

1559
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:33,812
- Confirmed what?

1560
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:37,746
- That, what I thought about
doing was a dumbass thing.

1561
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,050
And, I would've never
done anything like that.

1562
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:45,353
- Here you go.

1563
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:46,187
- Thank you.

1564
01:04:46,189 --> 01:04:47,716
- You're welcome.

1565
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:48,834
- Smells delicious.

1566
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:50,502
- Oh, please.

1567
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,335
- Can I order today?

1568
01:04:51,337 --> 01:04:52,169
- What do you want?

1569
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:54,052
- I'll take a tuna melt, well-done fries,

1570
01:04:54,054 --> 01:04:55,824
and a lot less attitude.

1571
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:57,626
- Oh, let me write that down.

1572
01:04:57,628 --> 01:04:58,502
Tuna melt.

1573
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,680
Fries. Well, okay.

1574
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:03,096
Less attitude.

1575
01:05:03,098 --> 01:05:05,163
Is that what you're looking for?

1576
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:07,718
- What is, uh, you would
think I tried to kill her.

1577
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:10,173
Too soon?

1578
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:15,463
Look, Tyrone, I was down
on my luck, and, you know,

1579
01:05:15,465 --> 01:05:17,809
Lois Lane needed surgery, and
I saw a financial opportunity

1580
01:05:17,811 --> 01:05:19,353
and, and I just took it.

1581
01:05:19,355 --> 01:05:21,680
- This is a really great sandwich.

1582
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:23,632
- Look, I've done some
dumbass things in my life,

1583
01:05:23,634 --> 01:05:26,820
and this is probably the biggest.

1584
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,179
- That was pretty stupid.

1585
01:05:32,072 --> 01:05:35,069
Uh, I almost feel bad
for calling the cops.

1586
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:37,808
- You, you called the cops?

1587
01:05:42,462 --> 01:05:43,722
Look, I understand.

1588
01:05:43,724 --> 01:05:47,090
I mean, I hated the way
things went down, and,

1589
01:05:48,513 --> 01:05:50,118
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1590
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,444
You're a great dude, and,

1591
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,570
I-

1592
01:05:54,572 --> 01:05:56,339
blew a great friendship.

1593
01:05:57,628 --> 01:05:58,712
My only friendship.

1594
01:06:03,746 --> 01:06:06,610
- You really, you really
think we are friends?

1595
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:08,665
- Yeah, I did.

1596
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:14,983
- Did you really enjoy hanging
out, and doing all those

1597
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:16,309
adventures as friends?

1598
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:19,603
- I do.

1599
01:06:22,162 --> 01:06:23,181
- Okay.

1600
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:25,313
- You're forgiven, and
I didn't call the cops.

1601
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,149
- What?

1602
01:06:29,129 --> 01:06:31,259
- Yeah, come on.

1603
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:32,671
I knew you couldn't kill anyone.

1604
01:06:32,673 --> 01:06:35,164
You couldn't even kill that
little cricket in the park.

1605
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,374
- Hey little one. Where you goin'?

1606
01:06:37,376 --> 01:06:38,805
They're gonna step on you.

1607
01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:40,586
Oh, no! Nah! Oh, I wanna hug you, too!

1608
01:06:40,588 --> 01:06:41,419
But go this way.

1609
01:06:41,421 --> 01:06:44,038
- But I do wanna know is,
who put you up to this?

1610
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,872
- Me, too.

1611
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:46,725
- Holy Satan's children,
where do you come from?

1612
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:48,797
- It's called customer service.

1613
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,659
I know it surprises you.

1614
01:06:50,661 --> 01:06:51,590
Are you good?

1615
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:52,611
- Better now that you're here.

1616
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:55,193
- Okay, that's too much. Okay.

1617
01:06:55,195 --> 01:06:56,534
Do you like pickles?

1618
01:06:56,536 --> 01:06:57,367
- I love 'em.

1619
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:58,737
- Okay. I'll get you extras.

1620
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:01,680
I am not gonna be
refilling both those teas.

1621
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:02,516
I'll be back.

1622
01:07:04,264 --> 01:07:05,096
- Look, Tyrone.

1623
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:06,905
I don't think you want know the details.

1624
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:07,896
- Yeah, I do.

1625
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:11,109
I wanna know who hates me
enough to want to kill me.

1626
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,370
I mean, I'm a good person.

1627
01:07:12,372 --> 01:07:14,112
I don't get into trouble.

1628
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:15,156
I've got a good loving family.

1629
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:17,175
I mean, I don't have too many friends,

1630
01:07:17,177 --> 01:07:18,737
except for the one who tried to kill me.

1631
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:19,790
- It was your sister.

1632
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:21,800
- What?

1633
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:22,676
My sister?

1634
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:25,218
Sarah?

1635
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:30,303
My sister?

1636
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:33,724
That's, that's insane.

1637
01:07:33,726 --> 01:07:36,730
I mean, I, wh-what did
I do that was so bad?

1638
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:39,590
I always thought we were-

1639
01:07:40,504 --> 01:07:42,160
That we were doing so well.

1640
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:42,994
- Really?

1641
01:07:42,996 --> 01:07:44,232
- Yeah.

1642
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,587
- You didn't notice how
mean she's been to you?

1643
01:07:49,644 --> 01:07:52,782
- Hey, Tyrone, are you done with my iron?

1644
01:07:52,784 --> 01:07:54,296
Uh! Ah!

1645
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:55,301
- Sarah, are you okay?

1646
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:56,578
- You're gonna spill it!
- Sorry, wait-

1647
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,776
- Get away!

1648
01:07:57,778 --> 01:07:59,638
- Well she's always been kind of awful,

1649
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,400
but I always figured it was PMS.

1650
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:03,421
- For 20 years?

1651
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:05,253
- That does seem like a
long time, doesn't it?

1652
01:08:05,255 --> 01:08:06,357
- Yeah.

1653
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:08,076
I don't think a woman can have
PMS for more than 30 days.

1654
01:08:08,078 --> 01:08:09,788
- Oh look, who's a gynecologist?

1655
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,865
On the behalf of all women, stop.

1656
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:15,252
My shift's about to end.

1657
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:16,922
- Aww.

1658
01:08:16,924 --> 01:08:18,707
- I know. Stop it.

1659
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:20,569
What those face?

1660
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:21,530
I forgot the pickles.

1661
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,902
Anyway, you better be paying for this.

1662
01:08:23,904 --> 01:08:24,983
For his meal.

1663
01:08:24,985 --> 01:08:27,127
This little Taiwanese angel. Are you Thai?

1664
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:27,961
- I am.

1665
01:08:27,963 --> 01:08:28,795
- You are?

1666
01:08:28,797 --> 01:08:31,439
I could tell it's, you know what it is.

1667
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,611
It's the bottom lip.

1668
01:08:32,613 --> 01:08:35,463
- I am. And can we get
a little privacy please?

1669
01:08:35,465 --> 01:08:36,299
- Yep.

1670
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:46,129
- I can't believe my sister
was trying to kill me.

1671
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,039
That's insane.

1672
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,518
I mean, what did I do that was so bad?

1673
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,490
- Sometimes you just, you think
you know a person, then bam!

1674
01:08:52,492 --> 01:08:55,253
They're trying to kill you,
myself excluded, please.

1675
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:56,875
- It's just so weird.

1676
01:08:56,877 --> 01:08:57,806
Like,

1677
01:08:57,808 --> 01:09:00,303
I mean, I thought I was
always so nice to her.

1678
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:04,322
- Uh! So embarrassing!
I can't wait till I get

1679
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:06,124
my license so your stupid face doesn't

1680
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:07,412
have to take me to the mall anymore.

1681
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,277
- Oh, I don't mind.

1682
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,199
I like taking you places
and meeting your friends.

1683
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:13,301
- Uh, as if!

1684
01:09:13,303 --> 01:09:15,554
No, you do not talk to my friends.

1685
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:17,205
Just hurry up and pull out.

1686
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:19,754
- Hey! Is, is Pugjin around?

1687
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:20,588
- Huh!

1688
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,481
This is why we're always
late, you and that stupid dog.

1689
01:09:23,483 --> 01:09:24,315
Just hurry me up!

1690
01:09:24,317 --> 01:09:26,605
No, Pugjin isn't even back here!

1691
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:28,527
- You sure? Is he back there?

1692
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:29,360
Is he pooping?

1693
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:31,434
Sometimes he likes to
poop in that corner here.

1694
01:09:34,354 --> 01:09:35,188
- Let's go!

1695
01:09:36,722 --> 01:09:38,496
Okay! Come mere!

1696
01:09:47,324 --> 01:09:48,158
- Pugjin!

1697
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,167
Oh, oh,

1698
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,236
oh, no!

1699
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,072
Pugjin!

1700
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:55,949
- Yeah. At least he won't
make us late anymore.

1701
01:09:57,015 --> 01:09:58,767
- Well, that's it.

1702
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:01,079
Being nice doesn't cut it all the time.

1703
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:03,872
But, at least you're not gonna die.

1704
01:10:03,874 --> 01:10:05,223
Not by me, at least.

1705
01:10:05,225 --> 01:10:06,545
You're good at this moment.

1706
01:10:06,547 --> 01:10:07,380
- Thanks?

1707
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:09,873
Look,

1708
01:10:10,871 --> 01:10:12,340
If I call the police and tell them that

1709
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:15,463
she was trying to kill
me, she'll go to jail.

1710
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:16,297
- Uh, me, too.

1711
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:17,806
- But I don't wanna hurt her.

1712
01:10:17,808 --> 01:10:19,307
- Oh yeah, I can see that.

1713
01:10:19,309 --> 01:10:20,298
She only tried to kill you.

1714
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,169
So,

1715
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,066
once again, too nice.

1716
01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:24,856
- Too nice.

1717
01:10:24,858 --> 01:10:26,214
- Oh, you two are still here?

1718
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:27,926
- Yeah. We're the only two, still.

1719
01:10:27,928 --> 01:10:28,917
And we haven't paid the check.

1720
01:10:28,919 --> 01:10:30,268
- I know that.

1721
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:32,130
- We'll be outta your hair really soon.

1722
01:10:32,132 --> 01:10:34,533
- Well, for clarity, you don't
have to be outta my hair.

1723
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:35,764
You can sit right in my hair.

1724
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:36,598
Get in my-

1725
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,431
Ha-ha, anyway.

1726
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:40,569
But you, okay? Not a fan.

1727
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:41,950
The only way you'll get outta my hair,

1728
01:10:41,952 --> 01:10:44,202
is if you go away for life.

1729
01:10:44,204 --> 01:10:45,036
- You know what?

1730
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:45,872
That's kind of,

1731
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:49,397
that's kind of genius.

1732
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:50,231
- I know.

1733
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:51,079
- Not you.

1734
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:52,340
Do you know any lawyers?

1735
01:10:52,342 --> 01:10:53,782
- I'm surprised you don't.

1736
01:10:53,784 --> 01:10:55,010
- That's racist.

1737
01:10:55,012 --> 01:10:57,541
- Oh, this white sugar needs to be filled.

1738
01:10:58,799 --> 01:11:02,370
- My cousin Bruce, he's,
he's technically a lawyer.

1739
01:11:02,372 --> 01:11:05,013
I mean, does University of Phoenix count?

1740
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:07,596
Anyhow, he's got this diploma on his wall.

1741
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:09,187
I think he printed it out himself.

1742
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:11,289
We should just go check
him out tomorrow morning.

1743
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:12,418
- Yeah.

1744
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,322
You know what? We got some work to do.

1745
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,872
We gotta go see your cous.

1746
01:11:20,394 --> 01:11:21,226
- Oh.

1747
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:22,460
- I'm gonna need change for that.

1748
01:11:22,462 --> 01:11:23,688
- Sure.

1749
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,563
. No, I'm just kidding.

1750
01:11:24,565 --> 01:11:25,778
Got you.

1751
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,436
- Oh! You're still a dick.

1752
01:11:28,438 --> 01:11:30,929
Sir, you should find another friend.

1753
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:32,400
- You should find another job.

1754
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:34,172
- This is my cafe.

1755
01:11:34,174 --> 01:11:36,154
- It's no wonder, no one's here.

1756
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:39,643
And put out an ad for more
patreons in your diner.

1757
01:11:41,021 --> 01:11:42,345
- Nobody's here because,

1758
01:11:43,724 --> 01:11:45,275
because they opened a Chipotle.

1759
01:11:47,524 --> 01:11:49,337
- Yeah. This is Bruce's building.

1760
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:50,629
- Wow. This is nice.

1761
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:52,551
- Yeah. Wait till you see the inside.

1762
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:53,674
- Really?

1763
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:54,510
- Yeah.

1764
01:11:59,277 --> 01:12:00,869
Oh, nice. Look, he's got a new sign.

1765
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:03,872
Last one said, "Stay blasian
with the power of Asian".

1766
01:12:03,874 --> 01:12:05,433
- Yeah. That's not any better.

1767
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:06,364
- Hmm.

1768
01:12:06,366 --> 01:12:08,226
- Wait a minute. His
real name is Bruce Lee?

1769
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:10,245
Yeah, he's named after our fifth cousin.

1770
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:11,084
What?

1771
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:17,085
Am I the only one with my
freaking out inside right now?

1772
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:19,452
Cause that's Bruce, that's the Master.

1773
01:12:19,454 --> 01:12:21,710
Whoaoaoa-

1774
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,555
- Okay, why don't you be like
water and freeze for a second?

1775
01:12:26,366 --> 01:12:27,198
- Oh.

1776
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:29,851
- What he say?

1777
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:31,710
- He says "The door's open", duh.

1778
01:12:31,712 --> 01:12:33,864
- Oh. How would I do
that if I'm not Asian?

1779
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:36,305
You know what?

1780
01:12:36,307 --> 01:12:38,496
This a miscommunication here, right now.

1781
01:12:38,498 --> 01:12:40,028
We having a misunderstanding.

1782
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,563
You need to teach me Mandarin. Ni hao!

1783
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:50,669
- Sorry. Sorry.

1784
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:52,552
Ey! What up, cous-o?

1785
01:12:55,407 --> 01:12:57,105
Huh-huh-hayay!

1786
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,211
- What's going on?

1787
01:13:00,213 --> 01:13:03,814
- Ah, you know, my
sister's trying to kill me?

1788
01:13:03,816 --> 01:13:06,850
- Ah, yeah. I figured this day would come.

1789
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:09,097
Ey, yo, I'm Bruce Lee.

1790
01:13:09,099 --> 01:13:09,931
What up?

1791
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:10,765
- Hey, I'm, Chest-

1792
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:11,599
- Whoop!
- Chester-

1793
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:12,641
- Oop, Chester Boyd.

1794
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:14,713
- Oh! Oh yeah, yeah, that's right!

1795
01:13:14,715 --> 01:13:15,884
Hey, oh! That worked great!

1796
01:13:15,886 --> 01:13:17,033
- You on it, bro.

1797
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:18,241
- Ha-ha!
- It's cool. It's cool.

1798
01:13:18,243 --> 01:13:19,075
- It runs in the family.

1799
01:13:19,077 --> 01:13:20,034
- Not you.

1800
01:13:20,036 --> 01:13:22,400
- So, weren't you surprised that, um,

1801
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:24,232
she was trying to kill him?

1802
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,304
- Yeah, but that bitch is crazy.

1803
01:13:26,306 --> 01:13:27,686
I told you something was off with her

1804
01:13:27,688 --> 01:13:28,557
back when we were kids.

1805
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:30,749
She tried to set my cat on fire.

1806
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,716
- Yeah. Sorry about Lucky.

1807
01:13:32,718 --> 01:13:35,470
- Why?

1808
01:13:45,526 --> 01:13:48,256
- Why don't you two gentlemen have a seat?

1809
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:49,668
So, what happened?

1810
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:54,675
- Well, she tried to kill him,
and, she hired me to do it.

1811
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:57,295
But, I don't want to go to jail,

1812
01:13:57,297 --> 01:13:59,608
cause I'm too sensitive for it.

1813
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,659
- Hmm. Damn, bro.

1814
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:02,070
I feel y'all.

1815
01:14:02,072 --> 01:14:03,662
Totally go y'all.

1816
01:14:03,664 --> 01:14:05,533
- Cous, you can't, you can't-

1817
01:14:05,535 --> 01:14:06,875
- Yes, he can.

1818
01:14:06,877 --> 01:14:09,397
Oh, yeah. In this
situation, he can say that.

1819
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:10,742
- Absolutely. It's called jive.

1820
01:14:10,744 --> 01:14:12,031
- Yeah.

1821
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:12,865
- Is it still called jive?

1822
01:14:12,867 --> 01:14:13,699
- Yes.

1823
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:14,563
- Okay. Yeah, it's jive.

1824
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:18,376
- So, my brother, what do we do?

1825
01:14:18,378 --> 01:14:19,788
- Well,

1826
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:20,699
first thing-

1827
01:14:21,535 --> 01:14:22,366
Damn! That's hot.

1828
01:14:22,368 --> 01:14:23,200
- Oh.

1829
01:14:23,202 --> 01:14:24,319
- Aw, son-of-a-

1830
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:25,198
Aw, damn it!

1831
01:14:26,146 --> 01:14:28,261
First off, did she offer you any money?

1832
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:30,170
- Yes?

1833
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:31,169
Uh-uh.

1834
01:14:31,171 --> 01:14:32,791
- Oh, it's a no bueno.

1835
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:34,653
Uh, that means "No good" in Spanish.

1836
01:14:34,655 --> 01:14:35,998
- Yeah, I know.

1837
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,832
- Si habla Espanol?

1838
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:37,666
- Si.

1839
01:14:37,668 --> 01:14:39,878
- Impressionante.

1840
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,309
- And, how much did she give you?

1841
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:43,211
- 12,000 Up front.

1842
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:44,047
- That's it?

1843
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,147
- Really?

1844
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:48,011
- Should have asked for at
least a hundred thousand.

1845
01:14:50,511 --> 01:14:53,241
- Actually, that really doesn't matter.

1846
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:56,601
As long as you took even $1,
that means you're guilty.

1847
01:14:56,603 --> 01:14:57,901
- Then why'd you ask?

1848
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:02,165
- Just kind of nosy.

1849
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:10,298
- Is it a Asian thing?

1850
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,731
- Okay, well, so here's the deal.

1851
01:15:12,733 --> 01:15:15,373
You need to prove that she
set the whole thing up,

1852
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,325
and that you were not involved.

1853
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:18,917
- How do we do that?

1854
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:21,174
- Uh, as your lawyer,
I can't tell you that.

1855
01:15:22,822 --> 01:15:24,953
- But, you're not my lawyer.

1856
01:15:24,955 --> 01:15:25,829
You're my cousin.

1857
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,316
- Bing-bong!

1858
01:15:28,318 --> 01:15:31,980
Very good, cous, very good.

1859
01:15:31,982 --> 01:15:33,566
- Uh, yeah.

1860
01:15:33,568 --> 01:15:34,665
- All right.

1861
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:35,554
How about this?

1862
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:38,201
If you can get her to
admit to this on tape,

1863
01:15:39,219 --> 01:15:40,509
we can use that.

1864
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:42,490
And, hopefully she's
not gonna mention you.

1865
01:15:42,492 --> 01:15:44,743
- Ooh, that's a great idea.

1866
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:46,296
We just have to figure out how.

1867
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:51,062
- I just told you how to do that.

1868
01:15:51,064 --> 01:15:53,151
- You did?
- You did?

1869
01:15:53,153 --> 01:15:54,262
- Yes.

1870
01:15:54,264 --> 01:15:55,834
- Wait a minute, I didn't hear a plan.

1871
01:15:55,836 --> 01:15:56,668
- I didn't hear anything, either.

1872
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:01,174
- Oh my God, guys, just
think about what I said.

1873
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:08,166
"How about this?

1874
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:10,754
If you can get her to
admit to this on tape,

1875
01:16:11,772 --> 01:16:13,091
we can use that.

1876
01:16:13,093 --> 01:16:15,644
And hopefully she's
not gonna mention you".

1877
01:16:19,347 --> 01:16:20,509
- Oh!
- Oh!

1878
01:16:20,511 --> 01:16:22,220
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, I get-

1879
01:16:22,222 --> 01:16:23,932
- Yeah, that was a little vague.

1880
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:24,833
- Very.

1881
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:26,124
- Fine.

1882
01:16:26,126 --> 01:16:28,496
But, you guys are walking
a very slippery slope here.

1883
01:16:28,498 --> 01:16:30,569
Now, if you fail, you're gonna end up

1884
01:16:30,571 --> 01:16:32,971
in jail for a very, very long time.

1885
01:16:32,973 --> 01:16:34,382
Well, actually, you're
gonna have fun in jail.

1886
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:36,635
You, you'll be fine, just sister-less.

1887
01:16:36,637 --> 01:16:37,468
- Wait, wait.

1888
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,157
Well, how long we talking?

1889
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:41,199
- Oh, at least 15, 20 years.

1890
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:43,144
- Oh, I, I, I can't do that.

1891
01:16:43,146 --> 01:16:44,653
I won't make it.

1892
01:16:44,655 --> 01:16:45,486
- No, no.

1893
01:16:45,488 --> 01:16:46,515
I don't want my friend to go to jail.

1894
01:16:46,517 --> 01:16:50,638
So, so, so, we gotta nail
this ball to the wall.

1895
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,307
- What?

1896
01:16:55,005 --> 01:16:58,947
- Do you mean you're gonna
nail this bioch to the wall?

1897
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:00,826
Or, are you gonna go balls to the wall?

1898
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:01,770
- Either or.

1899
01:17:01,772 --> 01:17:05,403
- Both! And don't call my
sister a bitch, please.

1900
01:17:05,405 --> 01:17:06,665
- But she tried to kill you.

1901
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,076
- I know, but you know what I mean.

1902
01:17:08,078 --> 01:17:11,289
Like, we just gotta make
sure you don't go to jail.

1903
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:12,310
- Okay? I agree.

1904
01:17:12,312 --> 01:17:13,572
- Yeah.

1905
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:15,433
- Yeah, I hear it brother.

1906
01:17:15,435 --> 01:17:16,277
- Oh, wait!

1907
01:17:17,155 --> 01:17:18,466
- Um, oh, ah!

1908
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:19,459
- I got it.

1909
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,860
I got it.

1910
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:22,696
I got it.

1911
01:17:25,315 --> 01:17:29,427
- What if I set up a meeting with her,

1912
01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:31,379
and we can get her admitting it,

1913
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:33,231
and maybe she'll bite.

1914
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:34,065
- Uh.

1915
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:34,983
- Look, this is crazy.

1916
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:37,298
Like I, I was so good to her.

1917
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,840
It's just absolutely
crazy why she would wanna-

1918
01:17:39,842 --> 01:17:42,135
- Oh! Oh, it's not about you, bro.

1919
01:17:44,895 --> 01:17:47,475
It's about the money
she'll get if you're gone.

1920
01:17:47,477 --> 01:17:48,406
- What?

1921
01:17:48,408 --> 01:17:50,779
- Yeah. Well you see, I did some paperwork

1922
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:52,671
for your parents a little while ago.

1923
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:54,112
Uh, we did their will,

1924
01:17:54,114 --> 01:17:56,334
and they left their
entire inheritance to you.

1925
01:17:56,336 --> 01:17:58,013
- That's whoa!

1926
01:17:58,015 --> 01:17:59,938
- And it's worth quite a lot.

1927
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,169
- Look, I don't care about money.

1928
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:02,551
I care about family, right?

1929
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:04,232
And then, plus she makes her own money.

1930
01:18:04,234 --> 01:18:05,166
I make my own money.

1931
01:18:05,168 --> 01:18:07,529
- It's 36 million dollars.

1932
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:09,723
- Game changer.

1933
01:18:11,622 --> 01:18:13,271
- Sorry, I just threw up in my mouth.

1934
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,105
- Holy crap!

1935
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:15,626
And if you die, it all goes to her.

1936
01:18:16,754 --> 01:18:17,669
Okay, okay.

1937
01:18:17,671 --> 01:18:18,827
You know, I, I know somebody.

1938
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:20,839
I know a PI who might be able
to help you out with this.

1939
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:22,400
Now, he's, he works out of his home.

1940
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:24,533
He's little bit off, but I think,

1941
01:18:24,535 --> 01:18:26,424
he can really help you out.

1942
01:18:26,426 --> 01:18:28,256
- Look, I just think that,

1943
01:18:28,258 --> 01:18:30,599
you have to stand up
for yourself sometimes.

1944
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:33,421
Especially to the people
that are not as nice to you.

1945
01:18:33,423 --> 01:18:34,923
- It's cool.

1946
01:18:34,925 --> 01:18:35,944
It's better that I know.

1947
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:37,150
And, and you're right.

1948
01:18:38,228 --> 01:18:39,878
You know, I've been told that I'm too nice

1949
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,400
by a lot of people, and
I'm sure casting directors

1950
01:18:42,402 --> 01:18:45,438
can tell, and probably caused
me a few jobs, you know?

1951
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:48,857
Bump it.

1952
01:18:48,859 --> 01:18:50,689
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

1953
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:52,994
My sister aint getting
a dime from my parents!

1954
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:53,913
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1955
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:54,835
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1956
01:18:54,837 --> 01:18:56,466
Yeah!

1957
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:05,863
- Why in the hell

1958
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:07,829
are y'all two

1959
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:09,698
screaming in front of my crib?

1960
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,964
Like two teenage girls.

1961
01:19:12,462 --> 01:19:13,481
- I'm not a teenager.

1962
01:19:13,483 --> 01:19:14,885
- You Tyrone?

1963
01:19:14,887 --> 01:19:16,265
- Uh, that's kind of racist.

1964
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:17,175
- I wasn't talkin' to you, fool!

1965
01:19:17,177 --> 01:19:18,226
- Okay.

1966
01:19:18,228 --> 01:19:19,062
- Him!

1967
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,134
- Yes, sir, I am.

1968
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:25,133
- That's great!

1969
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,184
Come on in, guys.

1970
01:19:26,186 --> 01:19:28,510
I'm making some great breakfast.

1971
01:19:30,661 --> 01:19:32,229
- That sounds good as hell.

1972
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:34,819
- What is going on?

1973
01:19:37,928 --> 01:19:41,139
- Would you guys like a kale
and almond butter smoothie?

1974
01:19:41,141 --> 01:19:43,521
- I would love one. Thanks.

1975
01:19:43,523 --> 01:19:46,302
- I'm good. You got anything else?

1976
01:19:46,304 --> 01:19:47,626
What?

1977
01:19:47,628 --> 01:19:51,079
Hey, um, by the way, I'm
Chester, what's your name, again?

1978
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:52,671
- Oh, forget my rudeness.

1979
01:19:52,673 --> 01:19:53,602
I'm Brooke.

1980
01:19:53,604 --> 01:19:55,203
- Oh, wow. What a cool name.

1981
01:19:55,205 --> 01:19:56,052
- Yeah.

1982
01:19:56,054 --> 01:19:56,995
- That's not really his name.

1983
01:19:56,997 --> 01:19:59,157
- My mom named me after my grandfather,

1984
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,655
who was one of the Tuskegee airmen.

1985
01:20:03,034 --> 01:20:04,723
- Oh, nice.

1986
01:20:04,725 --> 01:20:05,557
- Okay, nevermind.

1987
01:20:05,559 --> 01:20:07,270
- What's a Tuskegee?

1988
01:20:07,272 --> 01:20:08,533
- I'll explain later.

1989
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:09,548
- Okay.

1990
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,379
- Hey, Brooke. Um, okay.

1991
01:20:11,381 --> 01:20:13,752
My cousin says you can help us?

1992
01:20:13,754 --> 01:20:15,403
- Oh, yeah.

1993
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:18,917
Bruce said that you guys
might be in some trouble,

1994
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:22,616
and that you were
possibly going to prison.

1995
01:20:24,505 --> 01:20:26,698
Man, that would suck big time!

1996
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,466
- Yes. Yes it would.

1997
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:30,118
Investigators heading to hat-

1998
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,710
- Lucky for you, I
still have a few friends

1999
01:20:31,712 --> 01:20:34,623
in the force who weren't
involved in my HR investigation,

2000
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,713
and I'll make sure that they
keep your name out of it.

2001
01:20:37,715 --> 01:20:39,157
- Oh, that's awesome!

2002
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:39,991
Thanks.

2003
01:20:39,993 --> 01:20:40,825
Thanks so much.

2004
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:42,190
- Dead wrong.

2005
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:45,178
Next, on "To catch a necrophiliac".

2006
01:20:51,261 --> 01:20:52,250
- Um, Brooke?

2007
01:20:52,252 --> 01:20:53,506
What's up?

2008
01:20:53,508 --> 01:20:54,740
what you doin'?

2009
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:56,151
- Uh, "To catch a
Necrophiliac" is coming on.

2010
01:20:56,153 --> 01:20:57,205
You guys wanna watch?

2011
01:20:57,207 --> 01:20:58,417
- Yeah.

2012
01:20:58,419 --> 01:20:59,427
- No. Um-um. We can't.

2013
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:00,466
No.

2014
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:01,300
I'm not doing it.

2015
01:21:01,302 --> 01:21:02,134
Uh, I'm sorry. We can't.

2016
01:21:02,136 --> 01:21:04,743
We need to send a woman to
jail who's trying to kill him.

2017
01:21:04,745 --> 01:21:05,838
- Oh yeah, you're right.

2018
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,952
I probably shouldn't be the
one watching this anyway. Huh?

2019
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,484
That's a violation of my-

2020
01:21:12,823 --> 01:21:15,644
But I figure, you know,
since you guys are here,

2021
01:21:15,646 --> 01:21:17,295
we might wanna just kick it a little bit.

2022
01:21:17,297 --> 01:21:20,689
Since, I don't usually have
a lot of company these days,

2023
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:24,533
and you know, when I do,
I, it, it feels good.

2024
01:21:24,535 --> 01:21:25,493
- Well maybe we could.

2025
01:21:25,495 --> 01:21:26,595
- Nope. We can't.

2026
01:21:26,597 --> 01:21:28,230
Um-um.

2027
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:29,758
Hey, Brooke.

2028
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,490
You know what, we can hang, right?

2029
01:21:32,492 --> 01:21:36,528
We can play pool, play
golf, you know, slap bones.

2030
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:38,300
Just later.

2031
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:40,755
Uh, cause we gotta move
on this, like, right now.

2032
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:42,586
- I feel ya.

2033
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:48,441
Yeah, I guess I'll just
go get my equipment.

2034
01:21:50,961 --> 01:21:51,795
- Yeah.

2035
01:21:59,351 --> 01:22:01,620
- What are you doing?

2036
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:02,971
We can't hang here.

2037
01:22:02,973 --> 01:22:04,965
I'm not trying to go to jail.

2038
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,618
- Did you see how lonely you was?

2039
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:11,019
It's true.

2040
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:12,280
He needs friends.

2041
01:22:12,282 --> 01:22:13,934
You put yourself in his position.

2042
01:22:15,728 --> 01:22:16,562
- Oh!

2043
01:22:18,731 --> 01:22:19,888
Oh.

2044
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,722
Oh.

2045
01:22:20,724 --> 01:22:22,335
Did you just woman-cold-shoulder me?

2046
01:22:23,896 --> 01:22:25,335
Ey!

2047
01:22:25,337 --> 01:22:26,414
Oh!

2048
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:28,196
Do you wanna get killed?

2049
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,420
- No, I don't.

2050
01:22:29,422 --> 01:22:30,254
- Okay.

2051
01:22:30,256 --> 01:22:31,088
- Thanks for asking.

2052
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:31,922
- Um-hmm. And-

2053
01:22:31,924 --> 01:22:33,082
- Can we not do this now?

2054
01:22:33,084 --> 01:22:34,152
- Okay.

2055
01:22:34,154 --> 01:22:34,986
Okay.

2056
01:22:34,988 --> 01:22:35,822
Oh!

2057
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:39,871
Hey, Brooke.

2058
01:22:39,873 --> 01:22:41,469
Um, you forgot the equipment.

2059
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:42,303
- No I didn't.

2060
01:22:42,305 --> 01:22:43,139
- Oh.

2061
01:22:44,595 --> 01:22:47,000
- You sure you don't want a smoothie?

2062
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:49,625
- You know what?

2063
01:22:49,627 --> 01:22:50,881
Sure thing. I'll take one.

2064
01:22:53,423 --> 01:22:54,352
- Ty? Another one?

2065
01:22:54,354 --> 01:22:55,403
- Oh. I'm, I'm good.

2066
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:56,304
Thanks, Brooke.

2067
01:22:56,306 --> 01:22:58,527
I'm on a keto diet.

2068
01:22:58,529 --> 01:23:00,178
- So, Brooke, do you
have something for us?

2069
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:04,296
Maybe like, um, I don't know,
a wire tap or-

2070
01:23:06,216 --> 01:23:10,208
- Wire? Ha-ha! Wire are so old school.

2071
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:12,430
Besides, the last guy who wore a wire

2072
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:14,442
got caught and burned alive.

2073
01:23:14,444 --> 01:23:15,867
Would you like ice?

2074
01:23:18,889 --> 01:23:19,723
- I'm good.

2075
01:23:21,351 --> 01:23:22,315
- Room temps fine.

2076
01:23:26,232 --> 01:23:27,584
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

2077
01:23:28,889 --> 01:23:29,990
Better without, right?

2078
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,164
- Yummy.

2079
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:43,998
- You think?

2080
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,133
- Yep!

2081
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:46,484
- Better than Jamba. Ha-Ha!

2082
01:23:46,486 --> 01:23:47,330
It's delicious.

2083
01:23:51,995 --> 01:23:53,091
Oh.

2084
01:23:53,093 --> 01:23:53,927
Oh!

2085
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:56,875
Thanks, bro.

2086
01:23:56,877 --> 01:23:59,938
But, I really don't need to
be writing anything down.

2087
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,774
- Ah!

2088
01:24:01,982 --> 01:24:03,181
But you do need

2089
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:05,619
to hear what's being said.

2090
01:24:13,622 --> 01:24:14,953
- Oh!

2091
01:24:14,955 --> 01:24:16,755
The pen is a tap!

2092
01:24:16,757 --> 01:24:19,227
- Yes!

2093
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:20,229
Yes!

2094
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:21,065
Yes!

2095
01:24:22,565 --> 01:24:23,566
- Brilliant.

2096
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:27,626
- Can I get it to go, to go cup?

2097
01:24:27,628 --> 01:24:29,242
Please?

2098
01:24:36,517 --> 01:24:38,887
- Testing, testing. Te-

2099
01:24:38,889 --> 01:24:39,840
They can't hear me.

2100
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,551
Or, they can hear me,
but I can't hear them.

2101
01:24:42,553 --> 01:24:44,953
If they answer, they're not gonna answer.

2102
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,454
Doesn't matter.

2103
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,288
- Hey.

2104
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,217
- Ah! Holy Satan's child! Don't do that.

2105
01:24:49,219 --> 01:24:50,959
- Why are we here again?

2106
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:52,911
And, why were you guys have Bruce's firm?

2107
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:54,743
- Oh, because Tyrone wanted me to meet-

2108
01:24:54,745 --> 01:24:56,815
Wait, hey, are you following us?

2109
01:24:56,817 --> 01:24:57,649
- Yes.

2110
01:24:57,651 --> 01:24:59,968
Because you are not doing what I asked.

2111
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:00,814
- And,

2112
01:25:02,192 --> 01:25:04,955
what exactly did you ask?

2113
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:06,444
- What?

2114
01:25:06,446 --> 01:25:09,167
- What, what do you need me to do?

2115
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:11,259
- Don't play dumb with me.

2116
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:14,322
Do what you said you would do,
so I can get on with my life.

2117
01:25:14,324 --> 01:25:15,974
Stop playing games!

2118
01:25:15,976 --> 01:25:18,831
- Okay. I just wanna be clear.

2119
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:23,838
What do you want me to do?

2120
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,099
- Your

2121
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:28,392
damn

2122
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:29,228
job!

2123
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:36,922
- Damn it!

2124
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:40,558
Damn it, I went in for the kiss.

2125
01:25:42,122 --> 01:25:44,523
- Okay.
I just wanna be clear.

2126
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:48,395
What do you want me to do?

2127
01:25:48,397 --> 01:25:51,810
- Your damn job.

2128
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:55,220
- Yeah, well, aside from her
punking you, you got nothing.

2129
01:25:55,222 --> 01:25:56,317
- I-I-I didn't get punked.

2130
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:58,016
I was, I was being cautious.

2131
01:25:58,018 --> 01:25:59,908
- She did seem like she was onto him.

2132
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:01,723
- Yeah. That's one smart cookie, you know?

2133
01:26:01,725 --> 01:26:02,557
I tell you what.

2134
01:26:02,559 --> 01:26:03,854
- Yeah, she smelled really good.

2135
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:06,995
Sorry.

2136
01:26:06,997 --> 01:26:08,917
- Yeah. Well, I am sorry, guys, but,

2137
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:10,839
this just isn't enough evidence to cut it.

2138
01:26:10,841 --> 01:26:12,040
It's, none of this is gonna stand up.

2139
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,163
You need to start thinking
outside the box, and I mean,

2140
01:26:15,165 --> 01:26:16,905
like, really outside the box.

2141
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:19,788
Like in a, using a
different shipping company,

2142
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,439
outside the box.

2143
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:23,787
Yeah. Because they use
really big boxes to-

2144
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:28,502
- Okay, that was terrible.
- That was really awful.

2145
01:26:28,504 --> 01:26:29,487
- That was bad.

2146
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:31,058
- That's embarrassing.
- That was God awful.

2147
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:31,892
- Oh, come on.

2148
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:33,621
That joke kills all my real clients.

2149
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:35,126
- Are they five years old?
- Are they eight?

2150
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:37,799
- And you know what I mean.

2151
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:39,848
Like, for Christ, you're an actor.

2152
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:40,839
Why don't you do what actors do?

2153
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:42,220
Make stuff up, huh?

2154
01:26:42,222 --> 01:26:44,095
Geez. He-he.

2155
01:26:45,386 --> 01:26:46,218
- That's it!

2156
01:26:47,054 --> 01:26:47,886
That's it!

2157
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,889
Oh, sorry.

2158
01:26:52,891 --> 01:26:54,352
It's okay.

2159
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:55,674
- Uh, you might wanna try decaf.

2160
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:58,286
- That might help. Yeah. Oh!

2161
01:26:58,288 --> 01:26:59,459
- Sorry.

2162
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:00,293
- It's, it's okay.

2163
01:27:00,295 --> 01:27:03,151
- Listen, um, when I met
Sarah, she was there waiting

2164
01:27:03,153 --> 01:27:05,013
for the real plumber, but he never showed.

2165
01:27:05,015 --> 01:27:06,346
- No. And that's a good thing,

2166
01:27:06,348 --> 01:27:08,690
cause if you had, you'd be dead.

2167
01:27:08,692 --> 01:27:10,569
- Ha-ha-ha! Thanks.

2168
01:27:10,571 --> 01:27:12,433
- Listen, the point is, she doesn't know

2169
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:14,322
what the real plumber looks like.

2170
01:27:14,324 --> 01:27:17,596
So, maybe if we went as a real plumber-

2171
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:18,429
- Yeah.

2172
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:20,932
- We can get her to say that
she set the whole thing up.

2173
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:22,250
- That is genius.

2174
01:27:22,252 --> 01:27:24,082
- Well, I thought so myself.

2175
01:27:24,084 --> 01:27:26,725
- Uh, there's just one
little thing I'm bumping on.

2176
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:27,803
- Why do you not have a shirt on?

2177
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:28,887
- I'm just wondering that myself.

2178
01:27:28,889 --> 01:27:29,788
- That's-

2179
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:30,629
No, no.

2180
01:27:30,631 --> 01:27:31,770
How are you gonna pull this off?

2181
01:27:31,772 --> 01:27:35,373
If she already knows who you
are, and she's your sister?

2182
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,596
All right, you, you guys cannot bring in

2183
01:27:37,598 --> 01:27:38,917
any more people on this thing.

2184
01:27:38,919 --> 01:27:41,620
Now, as your attorney I
strongly advise against it.

2185
01:27:41,622 --> 01:27:43,421
- Oh, I got it, again.

2186
01:27:43,423 --> 01:27:45,103
Okay, Family Feud.

2187
01:27:45,105 --> 01:27:46,845
I think I know someone who can help us.

2188
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:49,251
I'm really good friends
with her and her boyfriend.

2189
01:27:49,253 --> 01:27:50,357
- You know, I'm sick and-
- This elementary school?

2190
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:51,316
- Tired of your excuses!
- What, you wanna go and chop

2191
01:27:51,318 --> 01:27:52,444
- It's excuse after excuse.
- That rule?

2192
01:27:52,446 --> 01:27:53,296
- What are you, 10?
- Does that feel good?

2193
01:27:53,298 --> 01:27:54,157
- What are you, 12? Are you-
- Yeah, you would enjoy that.

2194
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,009
- Prepubescent? Are you back-
- You would like to-

2195
01:27:56,011 --> 01:27:58,172
- To prepuberty? It looks-
- Belittle me. Every time!

2196
01:27:58,174 --> 01:27:59,619
- Like you might be!
- Is it because he's here?

2197
01:27:59,621 --> 01:28:00,578
- You know what?
- You wanna make me feel-

2198
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,751
- Maybe Chester can weigh in-
- Small? Always. You know wha-

2199
01:28:01,753 --> 01:28:02,731
- On this situation.
- You know what? Really.

2200
01:28:02,733 --> 01:28:03,907
- Yeah, maybe he could.

2201
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,175
- Ex-boyfriend, sorry.

2202
01:28:07,177 --> 01:28:08,737
- So you're saying there's a chance.

2203
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:09,571
- I am.

2204
01:28:09,573 --> 01:28:11,139
Uh!

2205
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:12,492
- Oh, that makes it better.

2206
01:28:13,483 --> 01:28:14,893
- Wait, so you need a mask.

2207
01:28:14,895 --> 01:28:15,764
- Yes.
- Yes.

2208
01:28:15,766 --> 01:28:18,256
Sorry to come at you like
this, but it is life and death.

2209
01:28:18,258 --> 01:28:19,277
- Yeah.

2210
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:20,111
I just can't believe that you remember

2211
01:28:20,113 --> 01:28:22,581
I do special effects from our
conversation over a year ago.

2212
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:23,962
- Yeah, well, it's our industry so,

2213
01:28:23,964 --> 01:28:25,403
you never know when you're gonna need it.

2214
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:26,571
- Yeah. Well, when do you need it?

2215
01:28:26,573 --> 01:28:27,926
- Today.
- Now.

2216
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:28,887
- Whoa, whoa.

2217
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:29,990
You're kidding, right?

2218
01:28:32,913 --> 01:28:33,745
No.

2219
01:28:33,747 --> 01:28:34,868
You're not kidding.

2220
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,415
Okay.

2221
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:39,487
Well, clear your schedules,

2222
01:28:39,489 --> 01:28:41,625
cause it's gonna take at least six hours.

2223
01:28:48,018 --> 01:28:49,578
- Six hours.

2224
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,828
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

2225
01:28:53,297 --> 01:28:56,548

Okay. So, you can come by
tomorrow to pick it up.

2257
01:30:11,321 --> 01:30:12,851
It needs to dry overnight.

2258
01:30:12,853 --> 01:30:13,765

01:30:13,767 --> 01:30:14,743
I really appreciate it.

2260
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:15,834
- You're welcome.

2261
01:30:15,836 --> 01:30:16,668
- Thank you.

2262
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:18,712
- Really, really appreciate
you for doing this.

2263
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:22,250
Hey, uh, I was thinking maybe after-

2264
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:23,451
- Just ask her already!

2265
01:30:23,453 --> 01:30:24,939
I'm getting tired!
- Shut up!

2266
01:30:24,941 --> 01:30:26,048
You're insulting my game!

2267
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:26,882
- Uh!

2268
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:28,767
- I was thinking that
after like, you know,

2269
01:30:28,769 --> 01:30:30,467
once everything's done.

2270
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:32,002
- Yeah.

2271
01:30:32,004 --> 01:30:33,041
- Yeah?

2272
01:30:33,043 --> 01:30:34,125
- Yeah.

2273
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:34,959
- Awesome.

2274
01:30:54,938 --> 01:30:55,770
- What!

2275
01:30:55,772 --> 01:30:57,866
- Are you still needing
your pipes cleaned?

2276
01:30:57,868 --> 01:30:58,977
- Excuse me?

2277
01:30:58,979 --> 01:30:59,813
- Hello, friend.

2278
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:04,322
I guess you took care of
your plumbing lines already.

2279
01:31:04,324 --> 01:31:05,369
- Who is this?

2280
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:07,090
- The plumber in green.

2281
01:31:08,408 --> 01:31:10,128
- You never showed up.

2282
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:10,962
- Actually, I did.

2283
01:31:10,964 --> 01:31:12,490
You seem more interested in that

2284
01:31:12,492 --> 01:31:16,004
busted Kevin Hart than
taking care of your pipes.

2285
01:31:16,006 --> 01:31:17,541
Well, I don't do three ways.

2286
01:31:18,378 --> 01:31:20,238
Well, I do actually, FFM.

2287
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:24,082
- Wait, so that, wasn't your associate?

2288
01:31:24,084 --> 01:31:26,394
How long do you think it'll
take to get the job done?

2289
01:31:26,396 --> 01:31:29,548
- Depends on how thoroughly
you want your pipes clean.

2290
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,049
I mean, we can do a 10 minute session,

2291
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:34,301
or we can go until you're
completely satisfied.

2292
01:31:34,303 --> 01:31:35,137
- Oh!

2293
01:31:36,156 --> 01:31:37,786
Plumbing.

2294
01:31:37,788 --> 01:31:39,728
Oh, well I, I'm so sorry.

2295
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:41,439
I didn't know that you came.

2296
01:31:41,441 --> 01:31:42,273
- Ugh.

2297
01:31:42,275 --> 01:31:43,396
- I mean, you were there.

2298
01:31:45,015 --> 01:31:48,557
Actually, yes, I do still
need my pipes cleaned.

2299
01:31:48,559 --> 01:31:50,869
- I'm not sure you're serious.

2300
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:51,890
I can't waste my time.

2301
01:31:51,892 --> 01:31:53,973
I have a lot of pipes to clean.

2302
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,004
- Actually, I just wanna be very clear.

2303
01:31:56,006 --> 01:31:58,550
You are talking about
killing somebody, right?

2304
01:31:58,552 --> 01:31:59,383
- Yes.

2305
01:31:59,385 --> 01:32:00,839
But please, let's just
stick to the terminology.

2306
01:32:00,841 --> 01:32:01,890
- Okay.

2307
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:03,053
- Thank you.

2308
01:32:03,055 --> 01:32:04,293
Yes.

2309
01:32:04,295 --> 01:32:06,244
- Well, I mean, mean it's
good that you're busy.

2310
01:32:06,246 --> 01:32:07,297
I think, that's good.

2311
01:32:09,022 --> 01:32:11,620
- It is. Now I will text
you a meeting place.

2312
01:32:11,622 --> 01:32:13,662
So come alone, and with the payment.

2313
01:32:13,664 --> 01:32:14,653
- Wait.

2314
01:32:14,655 --> 01:32:15,822
- Um,

2315
01:32:15,824 --> 01:32:17,372
actually,

2316
01:32:17,374 --> 01:32:19,402
I have two bad pipes now.

2317
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,785
Is that a problem?

2318
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:25,013
- Is double payment a
problem?

2319
01:32:25,015 --> 01:32:26,131
- Not at all.

2320
01:32:26,133 --> 01:32:26,965
- Good.

2321
01:32:26,967 --> 01:32:27,818
I'll be in touch.

2322
01:32:32,601 --> 01:32:36,104
- Now you and your bestie can get cleaned.

2323
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:43,216
- Oh, I hope this works.

2324
01:32:47,489 --> 01:32:48,323
- Hello?

2325
01:32:54,264 --> 01:32:55,138
Hello?

2326
01:33:03,273 --> 01:33:04,107
Hello?

2327
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:18,413
- Looking for someone?

2328
01:33:19,499 --> 01:33:21,241
Ah! Hey! It's me!

2329
01:33:21,243 --> 01:33:22,914
Hey! Hey! It's me!

2330
01:33:22,916 --> 01:33:24,334
I'm the Plumber!

2331
01:33:25,252 --> 01:33:27,871
- I'm sorry. I, you never know!

2332
01:33:29,369 --> 01:33:30,203
- Feisty.

2333
01:33:31,171 --> 01:33:33,692
- Goodness, I, I thought
you were trying to rob me.

2334
01:33:33,694 --> 01:33:35,433
So I had to be ready.

2335
01:33:35,435 --> 01:33:37,541
I almost pepper sprayed you.

2336
01:33:37,543 --> 01:33:39,903
- Guess I'm lucky just
to get a bag to the face.

2337
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:42,971
But I'm straight.

2338
01:33:42,973 --> 01:33:44,057
Need some assistance?

2339
01:33:45,225 --> 01:33:46,545
- Yes.

2340
01:33:46,547 --> 01:33:50,719
- What pipes do you
need cleansing, exactly?

2341
01:33:50,721 --> 01:33:54,447
- I need you to kill my brother
and his stupid ass friend.

2342
01:33:55,856 --> 01:33:57,691
- Okay, well that was. Uh-

2343
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:02,285
Do you have a picture of
these two handsome young men?

2344
01:34:03,725 --> 01:34:05,043
- I wouldn't say handsome.

2345
01:34:05,045 --> 01:34:06,246
I mean, they're alright.

2346
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,971
- This is some sweet ass.

2347
01:34:12,973 --> 01:34:14,563
- Who cares?

2348
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:15,674
He'll be on the golf course tomorrow

2349
01:34:15,676 --> 01:34:17,866
playing that dumbass game.

2350
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:22,705
They're trying to be Tiger
Woods, more like Tigger Forest.

2351
01:34:22,707 --> 01:34:24,346
- That's not very nice.

2352
01:34:24,348 --> 01:34:25,180
- Say what?

2353
01:34:25,182 --> 01:34:27,355
- Nothing. Yeah. Take out "Rush Hour".

2354
01:34:27,357 --> 01:34:30,509
- Yes, make it look like an accident.

2355
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:31,461
Make it a good one.

2356
01:34:32,973 --> 01:34:35,253
- Telling me how to do my job?

2357
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:36,304
- No!

2358
01:34:36,306 --> 01:34:37,138
Sorry.

2359
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,989
I'm sure you're very good at your job.

2360
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,144
- I'm the best.

2361
01:34:43,724 --> 01:34:44,558
- Okay.

2362
01:34:46,006 --> 01:34:46,840
- Cash?

2363
01:34:47,987 --> 01:34:49,247
- Yes.

2364
01:34:49,249 --> 01:34:50,083
Sorry.

2365
01:34:55,143 --> 01:34:56,144
Here you go.

2366
01:34:57,193 --> 01:34:59,045
This is down payment, like you asked.

2367
01:35:02,793 --> 01:35:04,382
- Sure you wanna do this?

2368
01:35:04,384 --> 01:35:05,468
- Yes. I'm sure.

2369
01:35:06,426 --> 01:35:07,866
- What's in it for you?

2370
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:10,118
- I get what I truly deserve.

2371
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,860
I'm not the adopted one.

2372
01:35:11,862 --> 01:35:12,791
I'm their child!

2373
01:35:12,793 --> 01:35:14,207
Not some charity case.

2374
01:35:15,165 --> 01:35:16,184
Oh, hell no.

2375
01:35:16,186 --> 01:35:18,141
I want what's rightfully mine!

2376
01:35:25,736 --> 01:35:26,570
- It's too bad.

2377
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:30,774
I loved you.

2378
01:35:34,303 --> 01:35:36,055
- What are you doing?

2379
01:35:39,923 --> 01:35:41,469
What the hell are you doing?

2380
01:35:41,471 --> 01:35:43,602
- Being a damn good actor.

2381
01:35:43,604 --> 01:35:45,228
You are a terrible sister.

2382
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,421
I'm so disappointed.

2383
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,660
- What are you talking about?

2384
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:53,632
- Don't play games.

2385
01:35:53,634 --> 01:35:55,253
It's too late.

2386
01:35:55,255 --> 01:35:57,175
- I need
you to kill my brother

2387
01:35:57,177 --> 01:35:58,527
and his stupid ass-

2388
01:35:58,529 --> 01:36:01,677
- I can't believe you tried to set me up!

2389
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:02,886
But it won't work.

2390
01:36:03,814 --> 01:36:04,713
- Yeah?

2391
01:36:04,715 --> 01:36:06,394
Well, I can't believe you
tried to kill me for money.

2392
01:36:06,396 --> 01:36:08,221
But, that won't work either, will it?

2393
01:36:09,455 --> 01:36:10,287
Hmm.

2394
01:36:10,289 --> 01:36:11,902
- We can't always get what we want.

2395
01:36:12,996 --> 01:36:15,824
- So that was your
favorite song, wasn't it?

2396
01:36:15,826 --> 01:36:16,658
How original?

2397
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:17,493
Take her, boys.

2398
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,934
Get her, boys.

2399
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,658
Uh. Take her, boys.

2400
01:36:27,447 --> 01:36:29,800
Oh, this is embarrassing.

2401
01:36:31,073 --> 01:36:32,723
You gonna hit me?

2402
01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:34,165
Aww! Stop with the bag!

2403
01:36:37,136 --> 01:36:38,845
- Stay down, lady!

2404
01:36:38,847 --> 01:36:39,679
Oh, my goodness.

2405
01:36:39,681 --> 01:36:40,763
You smell good.

2406
01:36:40,765 --> 01:36:42,249
What are you wearing?

2407
01:36:42,251 --> 01:36:43,269
- Freeze!

2408
01:36:43,271 --> 01:36:44,103
- Oh, whoa!

2409
01:36:44,105 --> 01:36:45,312
Whoa!

2410
01:36:45,314 --> 01:36:47,012
- Officers!

2411
01:36:47,014 --> 01:36:48,935
Thank goodness, you're here!

2412
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:50,779
These goons, they tried to attack me!

2413
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:51,740
- Wasn't me.

2414
01:36:51,742 --> 01:36:53,781
- Arrest them, please.

2415
01:36:53,783 --> 01:36:55,403
- Is the coast clear?

2416
01:36:55,405 --> 01:36:56,635
- It's all clear, Bruce.

2417
01:36:56,637 --> 01:36:57,866
Come on out, buddy.

2418
01:36:57,868 --> 01:36:59,119
We've got this from here.

2419
01:37:00,988 --> 01:37:02,130
- What are you doing?

2420
01:37:02,132 --> 01:37:05,226
- Sarah Lee, you're under arrest
for attempted manslaughter.

2421
01:37:05,228 --> 01:37:07,155
- Wha-wha-

2422
01:37:07,157 --> 01:37:08,734
You'll hear from my lawyers!

2423
01:37:08,736 --> 01:37:10,070
This isn't over!

2424
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:12,941
Uh! Let go of me!

2425
01:37:12,943 --> 01:37:15,163
- Mr. Lee, we heard everything.

2426
01:37:15,165 --> 01:37:17,145
She's going away for a long time.

2427
01:37:17,147 --> 01:37:18,849
You don't have to worry about her.

2428
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,523
But, damn, she fine!

2429
01:37:21,525 --> 01:37:23,183
And she smell good!

2430
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,602
- Right?

2431
01:37:25,604 --> 01:37:26,935
Spicy!

2432
01:37:26,937 --> 01:37:27,769
- Hey, Bruce.

2433
01:37:27,771 --> 01:37:28,603
Can you tell Brooke I said thanks

2434
01:37:28,605 --> 01:37:29,788
for getting my brother outta that jam?

2435
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:30,622
- Absolutely.

2436
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,671
And thank you so much for
taking care of my cousin.

2437
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:34,603
Okay, let me, uh, and-

2438
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:36,094
- Okay, enough with the slappy things.

2439
01:37:36,096 --> 01:37:37,716
Everything's right here.

2440
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:38,677
On this little pen.

2441
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:39,998
- Oh, the little pen?

2442
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,082
Okay.

2443
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:44,202
- Hey, do, do you think
it, it got the tackle?

2444
01:37:44,204 --> 01:37:47,428
Cause I really felt like
Neo from the Matrix.

2445
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:52,460
- Bullet time. That's
what he's doing, guys.

2446
01:37:52,462 --> 01:37:53,421
It's kind of his thing.

2447
01:37:53,423 --> 01:37:55,884
Except, the pen is really a sound thing.

2448
01:37:55,886 --> 01:37:57,626
Not really a visual thing.

2449
01:37:57,628 --> 01:37:58,587
- Let's get outta here.

2450
01:37:58,589 --> 01:38:00,839
- It's bullet time.

2451
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:02,671
- By the way, do you ever have
one of Brooke's smoothies?

2452
01:38:02,673 --> 01:38:04,105
- Yes. Yes I have, with the almonds.

2453
01:38:04,107 --> 01:38:05,433
- Good job, my brother.

2454
01:38:05,435 --> 01:38:07,702
Ah, you did it.

2455
01:38:07,704 --> 01:38:09,187
Am I my brother's keeper?

2456
01:38:09,189 --> 01:38:11,428
- You are my brother's keeper.

2457
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:12,431
- Ooh.
- Ooh!

2458
01:38:15,255 --> 01:38:16,111
- So, what next?

2459
01:38:16,113 --> 01:38:18,076
- I have an idea.

2460
01:38:18,078 --> 01:38:19,427
You still have the money, right?

2461
01:38:19,429 --> 01:38:20,261
- Yeah.

2462
01:38:20,263 --> 01:38:21,653
- Sweet.

2463
01:38:21,655 --> 01:38:23,010
So, yeah.

2464
01:38:23,012 --> 01:38:23,846
Oh, okay.

2465
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:27,566
- You should say something.

2466
01:38:27,568 --> 01:38:28,399
- Nope, I messed up.

2467
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:29,233
Let it go.

2468
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:30,067
- Yes, you did.

2469
01:38:30,069 --> 01:38:31,710
Hey, uh, my name's Chester.

2470
01:38:31,712 --> 01:38:32,713
I wanna talk to you.

2471
01:38:33,604 --> 01:38:35,433
- Okay, look, she got her arms folded.

2472
01:38:35,435 --> 01:38:36,424
You don't approach a sister

2473
01:38:36,426 --> 01:38:38,178
when her arms are folded like that.

2474
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:40,454
- Yes.

2475
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:41,288
- Oh.

2476
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:42,374
- What is it?

2477
01:38:43,358 --> 01:38:44,192
Um.

2478
01:38:46,826 --> 01:38:47,660
- Hi.

2479
01:38:49,103 --> 01:38:51,500
Listen, I messed up.

2480
01:38:51,502 --> 01:38:53,301
And, I wasn't stalking you.

2481
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:56,424
- No. And you weren't trying to kill him?

2482
01:38:56,426 --> 01:38:58,376
- Well, yes.

2483
01:38:58,378 --> 01:38:59,210
No.

2484
01:38:59,212 --> 01:39:00,208
Yes. No.

2485
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:01,044
Wait.

2486
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:04,322
Listen, I, I took a job,

2487
01:39:04,324 --> 01:39:05,463
but I wasn't gonna go through with it.

2488
01:39:05,465 --> 01:39:07,506
And it was stupid.

2489
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:10,388
As for you, yes, I took
photos of you, but,

2490
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:12,340
I only did it for research.

2491
01:39:12,342 --> 01:39:13,451
- Research?

2492
01:39:13,453 --> 01:39:16,244
- Yeah. Whenever I write
a script, or I try to,

2493
01:39:16,246 --> 01:39:19,543
I pull photos of, you
know, people that I think,

2494
01:39:19,545 --> 01:39:21,169
you know, are similar to my characters.

2495
01:39:21,171 --> 01:39:23,842
And I needed a strong
independent woman, who looks

2496
01:39:23,844 --> 01:39:26,635
like she could hold
her own in a bar fight.

2497
01:39:26,637 --> 01:39:28,436
- So, you're saying I look rough?

2498
01:39:28,438 --> 01:39:30,809
- No, you didn't get any of the strong,

2499
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:33,612
independent stuff that I was-

2500
01:39:33,614 --> 01:39:35,373
Okay. It was stupid.

2501
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:36,207
It was stupid.

2502
01:39:36,209 --> 01:39:37,265
And I was a jerk to both of you.

2503
01:39:37,267 --> 01:39:38,436
And, and I'm sorry.

2504
01:39:38,438 --> 01:39:41,895
I-I know the true valuable
friendship, because,

2505
01:39:43,423 --> 01:39:45,824
when you do stupid things,
you, you lose friends,

2506
01:39:45,826 --> 01:39:48,256
and you, I don't wanna do that.

2507
01:39:48,258 --> 01:39:50,033
So again, I have to say, I'm sorry.

2508
01:39:53,964 --> 01:39:55,133
- Okay.

2509
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:55,969
I forgive you.

2510
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:58,702
- What?

2511
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:00,384
Really?

2512
01:40:01,599 --> 01:40:02,791
- Ha-ha-ha! Yeah.

2513
01:40:02,793 --> 01:40:04,172
I ran into Tyrone the other day,

2514
01:40:04,174 --> 01:40:05,614
and he explained it all to me.

2515
01:40:05,616 --> 01:40:07,986
We both know that you
couldn't kill anyone, and,

2516
01:40:07,988 --> 01:40:09,990
you and I have only had one date so far.

2517
01:40:11,051 --> 01:40:12,345
- What-, really?

2518
01:40:13,303 --> 01:40:15,223
Wait a minute. You two?

2519
01:40:15,225 --> 01:40:16,057
- Gotcha.

2520
01:40:16,059 --> 01:40:16,891
- Oh!

2521
01:40:16,893 --> 01:40:18,436
Oh, okay.

2522
01:40:18,438 --> 01:40:19,272
Okay.

2523
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:22,821
You know what, I'll call you.

2524
01:40:22,823 --> 01:40:23,662
Or I'll knock on your door.

2525
01:40:23,664 --> 01:40:24,533
- No more pictures.

2526
01:40:24,535 --> 01:40:25,366
- Okay. No more pictures.

2527
01:40:25,368 --> 01:40:26,200
- Stalker.

2528
01:40:26,202 --> 01:40:27,034
- No more stalking.

2529
01:40:27,036 --> 01:40:28,226
I won't do it. Thanks again.

2530
01:40:28,228 --> 01:40:29,631
- Bye.

2531
01:40:29,633 --> 01:40:30,466
