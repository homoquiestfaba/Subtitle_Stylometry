1
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:31,842
So much for easy.

2
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:32,879
What is that?

3
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:39,846
He's already decoding the orb.

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,444
Bugger.

5
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:45,923
Headset.

6
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:10,583
You've got to get everyone out.

7
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:13,814
What do you suggest,
the fire alarm?

8
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,290
Not bad.

9
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:23,727
But that's just the alarm.

10
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:25,924
There's no danger.

11
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,398
Do you think anyone here

12
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:29,561
is paid enough
to take that chance?

13
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:38,941
Don't even think about it.

14
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,309
It's her.

15
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,585
Yes?

16
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,050
Damn!

17
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,490
I'm glad, Lara.

18
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:03,825
That would've been too easy.

19
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,669
Give me your best.

20
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,145
How's that?

21
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,224
I'm going off-line.

22
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:34,487
No, don't...

23
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,662
Thanks.

24
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,563
You're welcome.

25
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,335
Hello, boys.

26
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,032
Did you understand
the medallion?

27
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:48,039
Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,575
The, uh, the markings
are sound waves.

29
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,440
We've translated
all the markings

30
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,706
from your images--
roughly half the orb.

31
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,441
Well, let's complete
the set then.

32
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,210
I'll record the rest
of the images

33
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,342
and send them to you.

34
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,852
Once you have them,
finish the translation

35
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,048
and transmit the sounds
back to me.

36
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:16,227
We need more backup.

37
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:34,217
Smart girl.

38
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,435
Move.

39
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:01,310
Don't shoot her.

40
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,576
Not until we're sure
the computer has done its job.

41
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,153
Do you honestly believe
you'll be able

42
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,744
to control what's in that box

43
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:10,813
and turn it into another
one of your weapons?

44
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,859
Really, Lara,
you disappoint me.

45
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:16,327
Have we received payment
from all the buyers?

46
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,364
No...

47
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,957
you don't want
to control it at all.

48
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,366
You're using the buyers.

49
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:24,961
They'll release it,

50
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,528
thinking it's
just another weapon

51
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,369
and the world blames them.

52
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,933
What's left
of the world blames them.

53
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,043
Once I've got hold of the virus,

54
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,412
I'll make enough antidote

55
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,077
to protect the
best and the brightest.

56
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:40,312
Heads of corporations.

57
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:41,411
Heads of state.

58
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,285
Life will go on.

59
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:45,620
Don't tell me you've never
looked around and thought,

60
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,250
"Wouldn't the world
be a better place

61
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,624
without some of these people?"

62
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,163
Well, I can certainly think of
one person I could do without.

63
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,965
There it is.

64
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,838
I'm sorry, Lara.

65
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,672
You would've been
welcome in my world.

66
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,406
Piss off.

67
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,277
Shoot her between the eyes.

68
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,610
No mistakes.

69
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,126
You asshole!

70
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:57,630
I'm going to get you!

71
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:58,925
Follow me!

72
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:19,642
You're mine.

73
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,029
Bingo.

74
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,037
Two one-way tickets
out of Hong Kong.

75
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:16,639
Parachutes.

76
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,138
Something a little faster.

77
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:24,316
Come on!

78
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:28,987
Our rendezvous point

79
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:31,717
is two and a half,
maybe three miles.

80
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,522
You're aware that no one's
ever gone further than one mile.

81
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,859
I am now.

82
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,364
This way!

83
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,831
Right, you go first.

84
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:42,334
No, you go first.

85
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,330
I'll go first!

86
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,879
Holy cow.

87
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,421
Follow her.

88
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,771
My friend!

89
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,602
Good to see you.

90
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,452
I suppose you want
pay now, don't you?

91
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,222
So what did we agree on, $200?

92
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,785
No, 300.

93
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,581
So this...

94
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,319
...rock is the map?

95
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,229
Yes, it is.

96
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,164
I've never seen anything
like it, have you?

97
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:06,038
And it's the only way
to find that box?

98
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:09,075
And just think,
you could take it now

99
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,837
and walk right out the door.

100
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,071
No, window's better actually.
Off the ship faster.

101
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,704
Harder to track.

102
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:20,476
Oh, Croft,
do you really think

103
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,214
I would do that to you?

104
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,623
You can break my wrist,

105
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,925
but I'm still going to kiss you.

106
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,152
Huh?

107
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:15,189
Well, not exactly
what I had in mind, but okay.

108
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,403
Why didn't you shoot Reiss?

109
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:20,063
What?

110
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:23,336
He must have walked
right past you in the lab.

111
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:27,072
Why didn't you shoot him?

112
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,875
I didn't have a clear shot,

113
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,643
and I had no idea
where you were.

114
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:33,686
I'll inform Ml6 of the
completion of your service.

115
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:34,742
You'll have your money

116
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:37,085
and your life.

117
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,487
Don't waste it.

118
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:39,490
Damn it, Croft,

119
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,254
this is no time to split up.

120
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,194
Yes, it is, before you make
the wrong decision.

121
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,766
Okay, you want to leave?

122
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,430
Go ahead.

123
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,997
But don't pretend
it's to try and save me.

124
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,042
You're afraid.

125
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,941
Afraid you might
not pull the trigger.

126
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,605
Afraid of letting
your guard down,

127
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,945
of letting anyone in.

128
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm not leaving
because I couldn't kill you.

129
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:14,585
I'm leaving because I could.

130
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:00,832
Huh?

131
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:01,703
Huh?

132
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,039
Cheers.

133
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,412
Lovely.

134
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,042
Hello, Bryce.

135
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,814
Hello, Lara.

136
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:23,583
Are you ready?

137
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:24,680
Yeah.

138
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:27,817
Right. Sending the last images
of the orb...

139
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:30,863
now.

140
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,493
Got them.

141
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,203
Translating.

142
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:43,765
Done.

143
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,413
Send the sounds.

144
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:52,076
Sending it now.

145
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:04,491
No, nothing.

146
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:06,828
Oh, well, back
to the drawing board.

147
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,025
No, wait.

148
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,568
The tones are being distorted.

149
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:12,865
Send me the file.

150
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,338
Look, Lara, l...

151
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:17,274
I really don't think
that's gonna work, you know?

152
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:18,401
Yes, course it will.

153
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,673
Ever heard your voice
on a tape recorder?

154
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,306
Same thing.

155
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,043
Why are we having
this discussion?

156
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,311
Send me the file.

157
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,876
Sending it.

158
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,718
Thank you.

159
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,558
Lara?

160
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:44,490
Lara?

161
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:47,158
Africa. It's in Africa.

162
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,793
Somewhere near Kilimanjaro.

163
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,201
Great, Lara.

164
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,865
How long will it take Reiss to
put his computers back together?

165
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,465
24 hours at the fastest.

166
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,668
Get in touch with Kosa.

167
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:58,903
Ask him to get the car

168
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,639
and meet me north
of his village,

169
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,738
0800 hours.

170
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:03,975
Bye, then.

171
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,345
A bit faster
than 24 hours, I'd say.

172
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:10,389
Out.

173
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,419
Africa it is.

174
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,045
Kosa.

175
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,046
Lara!

176
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,173
How are you?

177
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,182
Lara?!

178
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:40,616
You had the jeep cleaned.

179
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,618
Of course.

180
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,019
I know how you like
your equipment.

181
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,456
Where are you? I can't see you.

182
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,186
Don't worry. I can see you.

183
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,558
Okay, where are you
coming from now?

184
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,621
Keep going straight.

185
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,529
Keep your speed steady.

186
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:00,798
Lara, welcome back!

187
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:09,337
Do you ever do anything
the easy way?

188
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,110
And risk disappointing you?

189
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:50,412
Kosa, we've never been here,
have we?

190
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:53,788
We didn't come
to this area before. Why?

191
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:56,054
Because I've seen
that mountain before.

192
00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:57,789
The box is there somewhere.

193
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:00,388
The locals call it
"The Mountain of God."

194
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,866
There's a tribe
that makes their home on it

195
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,232
that might help us.

196
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:51,240
Leave this object and go.

197
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:54,445
Leave this object and go!

198
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,181
Never speak of it.

199
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:57,847
To trespass
on the Cradle of Life

200
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,914
is to risk flooding
the entire world

201
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,256
with death.

202
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:04,626
Men are coming for the box,

203
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:05,959
and unlike me,

204
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:08,966
they won't look at it
with fear, or respect.

205
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,228
They will open it.

206
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,633
They want to use it.

207
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:14,070
And I'm sorry
if I have to disturb your gods

208
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:15,834
to keep this from happening...

209
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:19,366
but I will do whatever I must.

210
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:34,115
Do you truly understand
what you are doing?

211
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:37,089
Are you truly prepared

212
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:39,823
for what you're about to learn?

213
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,701
Some secrets

214
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,259
must remain secrets.

215
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,964
These are very heavy

216
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,269
burdens, very lonely burdens.

217
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:57,040
And if you find the box,
you will have to carry them.

218
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,549
I am prepared, sir.

219
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,823
He warns that no one
who has gone looking for the box

220
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,654
has come back.

221
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,887
He says
the land beyond the canyon

222
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:11,987
belongs to the Shadow Guardians.

223
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:14,089
Shadow Guardians?

224
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,503
They do not sleep.

225
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:20,402
They never rest.

226
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:24,966
They move like a wind.

227
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:29,845
And anything that walks
their land, will die.

228
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,314
And the Cradle itself?

229
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:35,944
Only with the orb
can it be revealed.

230
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:39,582
Inside you will find
a place of madness--

231
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:41,626
sky and earth are one,

232
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:43,525
direction meaningless.

233
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,294
He's going to give us 20 men

234
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,031
to take us
as far as they can...

235
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:56,632
to the Cradle of Life,
where the box is hidden.

236
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:03,241
We're getting closer.

237
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,047
He said you are right.

238
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,623
The Cradle of Life lies
near the summit.

239
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,527
He wants to know how you knew.

240
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:17,823
The orb.

241
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:26,062
He says he will not
turn back with the others.

242
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:27,638
He will go as far as we go.

243
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:31,639
He will fight
the Shadow Guardians.

244
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,045
You're a very brave man.

245
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:38,282
What is...
what is he saying?

246
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,478
That your accent is funny.

247
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,583
Get down!

248
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:19,754
Get down!

249
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:24,296
Back! Back!

250
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:37,475
Back!

251
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:38,339
Get back!

252
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:59,028
Thank you, Lara,
for leading us here,

253
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,655
and for finding the orb
in the first place.

254
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:03,635
However, you have seen
the exact position.

255
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:04,795
However, you have seen
the exact position.

256
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,430
You could save me hours,
days even.

257
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:09,974
Help me; I'll make it
worth your while.

258
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,573
No.

259
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,044
But think of what
I'm offering you.

260
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:16,341
Let her go.

261
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:22,044
The chance to find out
how it all began.

262
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,850
Life, Lara, the origin
of what we are.

263
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:29,257
Don't tell me
you're not tempted.

264
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,523
That's what got Pandora
into trouble.

265
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:34,430
They told me you wouldn't do it,

266
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,297
and I told them you would

267
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:39,394
rather than lose two
of your closest friends.

268
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:43,698
Take us to the Cradle of Life.

269
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:45,107
I'm sorry, Lara.

270
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:50,376
It's your destiny
to see what's inside.

271
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,815
He is right.

272
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:55,183
It's just beyond the canyon,
remember?

273
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:57,154
Such a short walk
might save your friends.

274
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:05,795
Well, if it spares my friends...

275
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:07,422
I'm up for a walk.

276
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,033
I'm sure she'd understand!

277
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,592
I have a plan.

278
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,002
You should have just
told Lara we were hostage.

279
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,471
Reiss would never
have found out!

280
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:07,117
I don't suppose either of you
know how to fly a helicopter?

281
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:09,618
I can.

282
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:11,162
What?

283
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,458
What?

284
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:15,398
Yeah. I've got over 1 50 hours

285
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,561
between flight simulation
games, models.

286
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,503
And in the real thing?

287
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,632
Two.

288
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,370
Two.

289
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:28,345
Well, you're only going to fly
it once I'm out,

290
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,177
so I hope you remember
your two hours well.

291
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:06,541
It's through here?

292
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,449
Mm.

293
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,113
Move, baby.

294
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:42,705
What was that?

295
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:43,941
You!

296
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,745
Check it out!

297
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,887
Keep moving.

298
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:39,469
What are you doing?
Back in formation, now!

299
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,415
Holy shit!

300
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,620
Don't! They seem
to react to movement.

301
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,846
They're gone.

302
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,279
I know we're close.

303
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:04,015
I've seen it in your eyes.

304
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,681
Take me to Pandora's box.

305
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:07,588
I don't know how.

306
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,717
Do it now!

307
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:15,062
Well, you were the one who
wanted to go for a walk,

308
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,067
so start walking.

309
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:25,133
The next one will be higher.

310
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:06,212
Only with the orb
can it be revealed.

311
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:16,592
All right.

312
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:19,221
I'll need the orb.

313
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:21,561
Do you want to see
the Cradle of Life or not?

314
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:24,227
You tell me what
to do with it.

315
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:29,065
Hey!

316
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:24,055
Don't think you can outwit me,
Croft.

317
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:27,326
Oh, do shut up.

318
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,161
So, this is the Cradle of Life.

319
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:40,704
Here we are.

320
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:44,213
She's all yours.

321
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:46,216
Time to be a hero.

322
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,110
There it is.

323
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:04,893
Perfect, isn't it?

324
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:08,524
All that power
in such a banal container.

325
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,728
Legend tells that when
Pandora saw inside the box,

326
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:14,363
she cried a pool
of black acid for tears.

327
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,999
And as it was a woman
who found the box,

328
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:20,476
I see no reason
to break with tradition.

329
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,076
A woman should collect the box.

330
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:27,374
Go on!

331
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:33,687
It is impossible to reach.

332
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:37,418
Now, take it!

333
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,326
Take it!

334
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,121
I don't think so, Reiss!

335
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,844
You okay?

336
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:10,846
Whoa.

337
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:12,007
I'm fine. I'm fine.

338
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,015
There you go.

339
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:14,676
Right.

340
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:21,949
You come prepared.

341
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:24,654
Well, I know how clumsy you are.

342
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,568
Hillary and Bryce?

343
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:33,467
They're fine.

344
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,053
Thank you.

345
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:52,555
What was that?

346
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:54,888
Oh...

347
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,189
thank you.

348
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,668
Let's get out of here.

349
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:22,844
Terry?

350
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:25,654
What are you doing?

351
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:28,590
What? You're joking, right?

352
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:31,058
We're taking this with us.

353
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:32,926
This is ours.

354
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:36,990
You're not walking
out of here with that box.

355
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:40,962
So, what are you saying?

356
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,906
We just leave it,
when it's worth a fortune?

357
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,840
Put it back.

358
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,774
No, I don't think so.

359
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:47,868
It could kill

360
00:42:47,946 --> 00:42:50,346
millions of innocent people.

361
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:52,440
Now you're being dramatic.

362
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:54,348
Put it back.

363
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:56,046
No!

364
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:01,922
I've helped you keep
this away from Reiss.

365
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:03,585
This is my reward.

366
00:43:05,163 --> 00:43:07,427
I'm taking it with me.

367
00:43:16,474 --> 00:43:19,204
So, it's come to this, has it?

368
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:20,801
Well, you do have

369
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:23,142
authorization to kill me.

370
00:43:24,582 --> 00:43:26,379
Better do it, then.

371
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:28,646
'Cause if you think
standing in front of me

372
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,948
is going to be enough...

373
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:37,220
You don't have it in you
to stop me.

374
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,564
See, all your beliefs...

375
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:51,464
all your ideals...

376
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,169
they're not real.

377
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:55,405
I am.

378
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,574
And you've loved me.

379
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,582
I don't know how strong
you think you are,

380
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:06,919
but you are not going
to choose them over me.

381
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,828
Now move.

382
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:13,761
No.

383
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:18,532
Fine.

384
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,382
The box is safe now.

385
00:46:50,755 --> 00:46:54,851
Some things are not meant
to be found.

386
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:07,037
Can't you ever do anything
the easy way?

387
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:10,232
I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

388
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:36,025
Lara, are you okay?

389
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,499
Lara, you all right?

390
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,935
This is... very touching.

391
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:43,496
You know us,
always making friends...

392
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:44,905
having a laugh.

393
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:46,409
Getting married.

394
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:49,111
What?

395
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:54,011
This is a wedding ceremony
and you are the grooms.

396
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:56,177
Good luck, boys.

397
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:14,898
-Go!
-Go!
