1
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,706
You guys wanna
handle this for me?

2
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,441
On it, boss.
On it.

3
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,776
I just said that.

4
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,586
Why do you even
set this thing, rafe,

5
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,588
if you're not
gonna go to sleep?

6
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,689
Give me the blaster,
quick.

7
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,724
Ready. Aim.

8
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,526
Fire!

9
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,261
Check the barrel.

10
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,362
Uh-oh.

11
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,632
Ah, that never gets old.

12
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,670
Great.
Now I have two headaches.
Let's blast it.

13
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,272
On three. One...

14
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,774
Rafe.

15
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,811
Rafe?

16
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,382
Rise and shine, buddy.

17
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,450
Rafe.

18
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,853
Are you up?

19
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,857
Wake up!

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,494
What?

21
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,496
Oh, boy.
Is it morning already?

22
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,732
Please tell me you
did not stay up all night
drawing again.

23
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,467
No, of course not.

24
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,702
No, the only reason I would
ever be up all night

25
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,605
is just because I'm so excited
to go to school today.

26
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,907
But I wasn't up all night.

27
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,608
Come here.
Why?

28
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,845
Gross. What're you doing?

29
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,647
I'm wiping the excitement
off your face.

30
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,848
It looks a lot like ink.

31
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,856
Mom, where's my breakfast?

32
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,224
It's coming.

33
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,660
Georgia,
for the millionth time,

34
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,795
Calvin's not allowed
in my room.

35
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,399
For the billionth time,

36
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,833
it's Mr. giggles to you.

37
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,802
And just because
you're grumpy

38
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,405
doesn't give you the right
to make the rest of us
miserable.

39
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,707
Okay, guys, come on.

40
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,643
Let's go, Calvin.
We don't have to take this.

41
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,612
You know, hon,
i have to say,

42
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,615
really impressive updates
for the vinlothian
star cruiser.

43
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,916
Thanks.

44
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,818
Look...

45
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,387
I know it's hard,
starting a new school
mid-semester,

46
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,423
and I don't wanna
take this away from you,

47
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,458
but you have to promise me

48
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,694
you won't spend every
waking, sleeping moment
working on this

49
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,829
when there's a whole
big world out there.

50
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,998
Mom, there's a whole
big world in there, too.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,833
I'm talking about
the real world.

52
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,301
Give it a try,
would you?

53
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,436
For me?

54
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,503
Hmm?

55
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,405
Okay.

56
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,010
On the menu for today,

57
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,679
we have a farro basil salad
with tomato coulis.

58
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,715
You know, Georgia and i
would be completely fine

59
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,450
if you just made us, like,
a bologna sandwich.

60
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,919
I'm a sous-chef,
not a chemical engineer.

61
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,487
Oh, and for dessert,

62
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,590
we have
a deconstructed lime tart.

63
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,459
Why'd you deconstruct it?
I don't know.

64
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,861
I don't wanna do something
the same old, regular way.

65
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,596
Where's the imagination
in that?

66
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,865
If you wanna stand out,
you wanna make a difference,

67
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,934
you gotta think
outside the box.

68
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,671
Did you order an uber?

69
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,614
Oh, man!

70
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,416
She's gonna get me arrested.

71
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,651
Better you than me.

72
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,454
Hello! Not getting
any younger here.

73
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,491
Uh, do that again,
and you're not
getting any older either.

74
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,760
I was just pulling it around
to save time.

75
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,628
Never again.

76
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,696
Move.

77
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,335
You should
wanna be early, too,

78
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,338
considering
your track record.

79
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,006
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

80
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,008
Fine. Shut me out.

81
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,779
But I'm the only one
willing to give you
the cold hard facts.

82
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,781
You've been kicked out of
two schools in one year.

83
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,916
Georgia, I'll handle
the lectures.

84
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,451
Go for it.

85
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,653
No, thank you.
I'm tired of that lecture.

86
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,388
See, you're exhausting
people.

87
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,057
This is the last school
that'll take you.

88
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,725
And if you mess up here,

89
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,527
you're gonna end up
at a new school

90
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,062
called "prison elementary."

91
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,930
So get your head
out of your keister.

92
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,732
Uh-tut-tut-tut-tut!

93
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,634
I'm just trying to help
a brother out, mom.

94
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,913
Look how nice it looks.

95
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,920
It's gonna be
a great first day.

96
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,421
I can just feel it.

97
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,824
So just be polite
and don't forget to listen.

98
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,925
I'm sorry, what?

99
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,896
See, this is why kids
shouldn't have Espresso.

100
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,566
No, no, no,
i told you no more coffee.

101
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,434
Narc.
Addict.

102
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,037
Snitches get stitches.

103
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,905
Stop. Listen. They have me
working a double again,

104
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,073
so Carl's gonna
pick you up.

105
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,109
No!
Why?

106
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,078
I know.
It's been a tough year
for all of us.

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,780
But he's there for me
when I need him.

108
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,782
And lately,
I've really needed him.

109
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,785
So let's all put on our
be-nice-to-Carl faces, okay?

110
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,690
Okay, we'll work on it,
we'll work on it.

111
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,859
Listen,
have a great first day.
I love you so much.

112
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,528
Be on your
best behavior. Okay?

113
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,997
Quiet in the hallways,
please. Okay?

114
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,733
I'd like to have a silent
hallway one of these days.

115
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,001
Excuse me, young man.

116
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,437
What is your name?
Rafe khatchadorian.

117
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,738
What did you
just say to me?

118
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,974
It's my last name.
I'm new.

119
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,642
Well, being new
does not entitle you

120
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,611
to swagger in here
with no clothes on.

121
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,979
I'm... I'm wearing clothes.

122
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,414
No, those aren't clothes.

123
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,516
Those are rule violations.

124
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,886
Every single thing
you have on flies
in the face of rule number 22.

125
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,754
What's rule number 22?

126
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,123
Are you telling me
that you haven't read
our code of conduct?

127
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,992
All right,
if I don't tell you,

128
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,628
I won't get in trouble,
right?

129
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,733
Unbelievable.

130
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,568
The code of conduct,
young man.

131
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,170
Read it, learn it,
live it.

132
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,506
Rule number 22 is,
"always obey the dress code."

133
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,875
That means no printed shirts,
no wild colors.

134
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,710
Look what's happening to
the collar of your shirt here.

135
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,612
Your headphones
are dragging it open.

136
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,183
Nobody needs to see where your
chest hairs are going to be.

137
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,551
Yeah, okay, yeah, got it.

138
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,988
"Got it"?
How about, "got it, sir"?

139
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,057
Rule number one
here at hills village

140
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,625
is to respect your principal.

141
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,860
And since I am
the principal,

142
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,728
that means
you need to respect me

143
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,030
by calling me "sir,"

144
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,932
or if you prefer,
"principal Dwight."

145
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,468
Or maybe even
"sir Dwight," if you like.

146
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,204
Good. You have recognized
my keen sense of humor.

147
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,538
Not everybody does.

148
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,207
Good man. Okay, good.

149
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,742
All right.
On your way into school,
which is that way.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,260
There he is!

151
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,564
Ah, intense, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

152
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,700
Hey, Georgia thought
i was gonna end up in prison,

153
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,702
but I think
I'm already here.

154
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,537
Yeah, well, you know,
at least in prison

155
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,573
we can carve, like,
shanks out of toothbrushes,
you know.

156
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,843
It's good to see you, Leo.
Honestly, I didn't think
you'd be here, too.

157
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,579
This was the last school
in the district

158
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,081
that would take us.

159
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,983
Holla!
Holla!

160
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,851
- It's so weird...
- Excuse me.

161
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,219
Is your name David?

162
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,188
No.

163
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
Were you carved
by Michelangelo?

164
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,559
No.

165
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,994
Stop standing around
like a statue.

166
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,795
You're blocking
the flow of traffic.

167
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,265
Yeah, you heard the warden,
get back to your cell, rafe.

168
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,868
Hallway etiquette is no
laughing matter, young man.

169
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,803
And rule number 11
clearly states,

170
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,239
"no loitering in the halls."

171
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,541
Okay.

172
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,075
Okay?

173
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,745
Okay, sir?

174
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,147
It's vice principal
stricker.

175
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,682
Go, now.

176
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,722
Shon.
Yeah?

177
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,891
Do you know how to
sync this to your phone?

178
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,160
Um... probably not.

179
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,563
Doesn't your dad
work at best buy?
Oh, yeah, he does.

180
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,065
Just in marketing.

181
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,733
So you don't get
any free stuff?

182
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,702
I do,
but mostly office supplies.

183
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,980
You got it?

184
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,250
It's just homeroom.
We'll wait.

185
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,322
Okay, let's start class.

186
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,123
Bella? Bella.

187
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,659
Please put your phone away
during class.

188
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,628
You can't rate teachers
on yelp anyway.

189
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,796
I've tried.

190
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,664
So we have
a new student today.

191
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,932
I'm assuming you are...

192
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,667
I'm a transfer student, sir.

193
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,135
Oh, you don't have to
call me "sir."

194
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,205
Makes me feel old.
And I already feel old.

195
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,274
I drive a saturn.

196
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,810
It's just, principal Dwight
told me to call
everyone "sir."

197
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,345
It's one of his rules.
Okay.

198
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,648
Well, I don't see any
principal Dwight in here.
Do you?

199
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,150
Seriously, do you?
Because he is
a master of disguise.

200
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,054
So we have a new
transfer student today

201
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,690
whose name I'm realizing
i did not ask just now.

202
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,359
What's your name?
Rafe khatchadorian.

203
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,695
Whoa! It would suck to have to
spell that dumb name.

204
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,897
Well, rafe,
welcome to hell.

205
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,766
Back to the homework
from last night.

206
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,702
You all listened to the Drake
and future mixtape last night.

207
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,239
Because today we will be
talking about fair trade.

208
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,341
Okay. There's a hot track

209
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,344
and it's produced
by future's Hendrix crew.

210
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,280
Drizzy, champagne papi,

211
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,716
is in the studio
with future and he says,

212
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,251
"hey, yo, let me
get on that track."

213
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,953
"Well, i'ma have to
charge you."

214
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,254
And what does Drake
say back?

215
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,989
"Charge me?
I thought we were boys."

216
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,724
"We're the best of boys.

217
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,126
"We're gonna make
a mixtape together."

218
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,728
But there's a tax.

219
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,264
Not anymore,
once NATO came along.

220
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,901
Teller, it's nafta,
not NATO.

221
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,871
Ah? What? Word?

222
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,873
Shon is right,
it is nafta.

223
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,975
So, now there is no tax.

224
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,879
So champagne papi
and young Hendrix
can be on each other's tracks

225
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,148
without having to
charge anybody.

226
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,750
Much the way
that America and Canada

227
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,352
have goods
importing and exporting.

228
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,955
Hey, kick-a-dorkian.

229
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,425
Does anyone have
any questions, comments?
It's Miller time.

230
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,760
Stay out of my way,
or I'll wedgie you so bad

231
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,096
you'll be able to taste
your underwear.

232
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,131
How?

233
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,936
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

234
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,373
<i> let's get ready</i>
<i> for the pain event.</i>

235
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,110
<i> Oh, this one always delivers</i>
<i> a fistful of hollers!</i>

236
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,212
<i> The grip-n-rip!</i>

237
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,416
<i> Holy yosemite!</i>

238
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,385
<i> Want to lodge a complaint?</i>

239
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,220
<i> It's the beaver-tail!</i>

240
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,925
<i> Irritating, even to</i>
<i> people just watching,</i>

241
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,893
<i> the man-bun!</i>

242
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,795
<i> Over-rated and over-exposed,</i>

243
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,732
<i> the Kardashian!</i>

244
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,934
You get that I can
kick your butt, right?

245
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,870
My bad.

246
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:19,938
There is an agreement.

247
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,040
Sorry.
Free trade.

248
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,275
For tomorrow,
i want everybody

249
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:28,747
to become familiar
with every single member
of the wu-tang clan.

250
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,483
We're gonna take
a little trip to the Bronx.

251
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,918
<i> So, in conclusion...</i>

252
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,121
<i> I'm not just gonna stand here</i>
<i> and make a bunch of promises.</i>

253
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,889
<i> Just this.</i>

254
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,058
<i> You should vote for me</i>
<i> because my dad is super rich</i>

255
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,360
<i> and my stepmom</i>
<i> is really hot.</i>

256
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,862
Oh, ho, ho!

257
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,834
Stormin' Norman,
what a speech!

258
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,169
Well done.

259
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,206
<i> Hey.</i>

260
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,509
<i> Uh, for those of you</i>
<i> who don't know me,</i>

261
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,078
<i> I'm Jeanne galleta,</i>

262
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,913
<i> President of the av club.</i>

263
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,516
<i> I'm guessing most of you</i>
<i> don't know what that is,</i>

264
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,786
<i> since I'm also</i>
<i> the only member.</i>

265
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,256
<i> Gandhi once said,</i>

266
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,992
<i> "we have to be the change</i>
<i> we wish to see."</i>

267
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,261
<i> And the way I see it,</i>

268
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:19,130
<i> cutting funding</i>
<i> for the arts...</i>
Hello.

269
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,398
<i> ...was just dumb.</i>

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,534
<i> We have to bring it back,</i>

271
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,069
<i> so we can express ourselves</i>
<i> as human beings</i>

272
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,338
<i> and not just</i>
<i> a bunch of robots.</i>

273
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,275
<i> Also, we've gotta do</i>
<i> something about this</i>
<i> dress code, okay?</i>

274
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,110
<i> It stifles individuality!</i>

275
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,545
Oh, look at that,
we're out of time.

276
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,079
Sorry, miss galleta. Gosh.

277
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,951
<i> No, no, no.</i>

278
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,021
<i> Please. No, don't clap.</i>

279
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,455
<i> - No need to be polite.</i>
- Thank you.

280
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,524
<i> Just hold your clapping</i>
<i> till the end.</i>

281
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,459
<i> I think we're probably all</i>
<i> voting for Norman anyway,</i>
<i> right?</i>

282
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,295
<i> I've seen his stepmom.</i>
<i> You're not kidding.</i>

283
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,164
<i> All right, folks,</i>
<i> you know...</i>

284
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,968
<i> That's not funny.</i>
<i> Why is this wrapped around...</i>

285
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,170
<i> Let's not wrap the microphone</i>
<i> around the stand anymore.</i>

286
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,872
<i> It's annoying.</i>

287
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,308
<i> Folks, in two months,</i>
<i> we will all be competing</i>

288
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,877
<i> for something</i>
<i> of the utmost importance.</i>

289
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,545
<i> Who knows</i>
<i> what I'm referring to?</i>

290
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,180
B.L.A.A.R.

291
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,582
<i> I can't hear you!</i>

292
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,383
B.L.A.A.R.!

293
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,118
<i> Now you're just yelling.</i>
<i> No yelling!</i>

294
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,154
<i> That's right.</i>
<i> In eight short weeks,</i>

295
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,589
<i> we will all be taking</i>

296
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:22,527
<i> the baseline assessment</i>
<i> of academic readiness!</i>

297
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,168
<i> All right. Hey, you there!</i>
<i> Do you love your parents?</i>

298
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,303
I guess so.

299
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,606
<i> Hear me when I tell you,</i>
<i> you don't love them</i>
<i> an eighth as much</i>

300
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,008
<i> as I love this test!</i>

301
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,610
<i> A few years ago,</i>
<i> my wife asked me</i>

302
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,912
<i> to stop paying so much</i>
<i> attention to the b.L.A.A.R.</i>

303
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,081
<i> And pay a little more</i>
<i> attention to her.</i>

304
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,084
<i> Well, she's gone now,</i>
<i> and I have no regrets.</i>

305
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,153
<i> And, folks,</i>
<i> if we are going to maintain</i>
<i> our number one standing,</i>

306
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,623
<i> which we most certainly</i>
<i> do wanna do...</i>

307
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,958
This is hilarious!

308
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,494
Oh, my gosh!
Zombie Dwight!

309
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,630
<i> ...only the b.L.A.A.R.</i>
<i> And nothing but the b.L.A.A.R.</i>

310
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,665
No, come on, give it...

311
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,402
<i> Hey, what's with</i>
<i> all the kerfuffle out there?</i>

312
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,308
This is legit hilarious.

313
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,679
Hey!

314
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,150
Hand over
the notebook, deenie,

315
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,451
if you know
what's good for you.

316
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,687
Smart move!

317
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,060
Oh!

318
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,339
<i> This concludes our assembly.</i>

319
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,353
I don't look like that.

320
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,489
I don't
look like that at all.

321
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,063
Son, as principal,
i think of myself
as the father of this school.

322
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,465
And there's nothing
i wouldn't do
to protect a child.

323
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,334
Do you follow me?

324
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,436
Sure. Yeah.
You think the students
are your children.

325
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,271
What? No.

326
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,439
The students
aren't my children.

327
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,074
The school is my child.

328
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,409
And you attacked
my child today.

329
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,545
You punched it
in the face.

330
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,247
What kind of a person punches
a child in the face?

331
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,316
That was a very
important assembly,
and you ruined it.

332
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,484
I know. I'm sorry.

333
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,186
Honestly,
i was just doodling.

334
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,556
Listen, man,
i am totally
into creativity.

335
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,257
I really dig it.

336
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,493
I'm a hip cat from way back.
You better believe it.

337
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,762
But it doesn't
belong in school.

338
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,697
Art should be
locked up in a museum

339
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,333
where old people can enjoy it
or children on field trips.

340
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,302
We get to go on field trips
to art museums?

341
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,671
God, no. No.
That's a complete
waste of time.

342
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,140
We're not doing that.
All right! Rule number 26.

343
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,441
Read it out loud, please.

344
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,745
"Rule 26.

345
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,179
"Any written material deemed

346
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,348
"inappropriate
or offensive will be

347
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,217
"confiscated and destroyed"?

348
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,752
And destroyed.
Very good.

349
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,487
You're a good reader.

350
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,423
Gus, bring your bucket
in here, please.
The yellow bucket.

351
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,627
This is a bucket full of acid

352
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,796
that will completely
dissolve your notebook.

353
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,431
It's probably not
a great idea to keep

354
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,066
a bucket full of acid
in a middle school,

355
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,367
but if you can think
of a better way

356
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,769
to dissolve notebooks,
I'm all ears.

357
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,704
Why are you still here?
Mmm.

358
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,273
All right!

359
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,375
Goodbye, offensive
and inappropriate material.

360
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,610
Wait, hold on.

361
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,345
Look, please,
I've had that book forever.

362
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,782
And, I mean, I worked so hard
on all those drawings.

363
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,383
Well, maybe if you had
worked that hard

364
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,785
on something
worthwhile instead,

365
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,254
like, for instance,
your school work,

366
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,488
we wouldn't be
here right now.

367
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,756
Please,
you don't understand.

368
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,792
These drawings
mean everything to me.

369
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,093
Really?

370
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,731
Well...

371
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,536
In that case...

372
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,738
Rules are rules.

373
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,579
You guys are doomed.
Bye-bye.

374
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,548
This super stinks.

376
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,684
Here we go.
<i> Tech support.</i>

377
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,486
Peace out!

378
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,189
It was an honor serving
with you, sir.

379
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,557
I'm sorry I used
your toothbrush

380
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,691
to pick out my nose.

381
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,860
Yeah, me too.
What?

382
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,662
<i> Tech support.</i>

383
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,731
Your new principal sucks!

384
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,401
Don't forget to draw me
on the other side, rafe!

385
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,447
Dude!

386
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,783
Hey, man. I don't wanna
talk about it, all right?

387
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,722
Hey, you, uh...

388
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,190
You ever open
that thing I got you?

389
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,193
Ah...

390
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,394
I'm sorry, I forgot.

391
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,730
No worries, man.

392
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,365
You've been busy. Just...

393
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,367
I just think it might be
a good time, you know?

394
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,668
Might cheer you up.

395
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,637
It's whatever, though.
Doesn't matter.

396
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,607
You want a ride?

397
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,910
You're funny.
No, not with that dufus.

398
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,645
All right, well,
I'm out of here.

399
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,747
Good luck.

400
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,549
Hop in! You know I can't
come to a complete stop.

401
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,351
Let's go!

402
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,752
Hurry up!

403
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,159
Let's go. Come on.

404
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,864
Bear, why'd you get a stick
if you don't know
how to drive it?

405
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,734
It's not a true sports car
if it's an automatic,
all right?

406
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,603
Besides, I really like
to feel the road
when I'm driving.

407
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,238
Hey, towel, please.

408
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,807
Sorry, I almost got "person"
on your seat.

409
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,509
Hey, "f" your "i,"

410
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,478
these seats are
Italian leather,
all right?

411
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,513
I'm trying to keep them nice
for the re-sale.

412
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,783
Bear, you do know you can't
sell a car you don't own.

413
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,786
Don't own yet, my friend.
Don't own yet.

414
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,290
104 more payments,
and this baby is all mine.

415
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,765
Hey.

416
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,400
Not so close to the car,
fat boy!

417
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,405
Come here, Calvin.

418
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,707
Come here, boy.
You're a good boy.

419
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,542
Don't listen
to that mean man.
Come here.

420
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,816
You did that on purpose.

421
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,384
So sue me.

422
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,420
I wish mom knew
what a butt wipe you are.

423
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,554
Hey.

424
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,223
Butt wipes feel pretty good.

425
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,924
Who doesn't love
a butt wipe, huh?

426
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,960
Everyone loves a butt wipe.

427
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,529
So I guess
the joke is on you.

428
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,410
No.

429
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,779
The joke's on you.

430
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:49,847
Huh?

431
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,582
Eh...

432
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,001
Hey.
Oh, hey.
What's up, man?

433
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,603
Oh, cool. You found it.

434
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,338
Oh, no.
Don't read the card

435
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,841
because then things are gonna
get sappy or whatever,

436
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,644
and I hate that.
So just open the present.

437
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,446
All right.

438
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,749
I figured your other one,
may it rest in peace,

439
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,885
was almost full,
so you probably
need another one.

440
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,888
It's awesome, man.
Thank you. But...

441
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,624
I mean, all my best stuff
was in my last sketch book.

442
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,825
Comics, inventions.

443
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,827
Expertly drawn boobs.

444
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,562
Those were realistic.

445
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,598
I think.

446
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,666
I hope.

447
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,535
But the vinlothians. Like...

448
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,937
You made the star cruiser.
You made their planet.

449
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,906
You even came up
with their battle cry.

450
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,041
What was it?

451
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,409
Grak-tung.

452
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,611
Grak-freakin'-tung!
All right.

453
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,513
And, like, their language.

454
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,915
Their star cruiser
night club.
Shh!

455
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,984
Could you lower your voice,
please?

456
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,519
What for?
I said, "shh."

457
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,920
What?

458
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,022
Okay, you don't want them
to know I'm here.

459
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,725
Yeah. No offense,
but mom doesn't think
you're the best influence.

460
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,593
Oh, okay. Well, she's not
wrong about that.

461
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,463
Okay, rafe.

462
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,398
Back to the book thing.

463
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,668
Are you ready
for the greatest idea

464
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,004
in the history of ideas?

465
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,506
Dwight trashed
your book, right?

466
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,010
So, you trash his.

467
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,545
Yeah, I guess
that could be kind of fun.

468
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,879
We'd take the shredder
from the back...

469
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,414
No, no, no.

470
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,016
We don't wanna shred
the rule book.

471
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,819
You wanna shred
the actual rules.

472
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:38,556
Every stupid rule
in this dumb code of conduct.

473
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,491
Leo, are you kidding me?

474
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,827
And get kicked out
of another school?
I would be disowned.

475
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,862
No, you won't.
You wanna know why?

476
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,566
'Cause we're gonna be careful
and nobody's gonna
know it's us.

477
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,768
So you're saying
we do it anonymously?

478
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,002
Exactly!

479
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,408
It is up to us to speak
for the voiceless,

480
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,677
to be vigilantes
for freedom.

481
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,446
We've got eight weeks
before Dwight tries
to measure our worth

482
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,682
on a bunch of bubbles
on a scantron.

483
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,016
I'm sick of people

484
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,952
trying to suck the fun
out of childhood.

485
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,854
Let's stop the suck!

486
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,723
Let's show them that
we don't give a...

487
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,127
What rhymes with suck?

488
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,595
Nothing good.
So?

489
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,934
Let's stick it to the man.
Yeah!

490
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,072
Hi!
Hi, mom.

491
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,208
Uh... look at you.
You're all dressed
and ready for school.

492
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,810
What's going on?

493
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:08,179
Uh, I'm just excited
to get to school early.

494
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,514
Really?
Yeah. Of course.

495
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,783
There's something
sticking on your shoe.

496
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,765
What is this?

497
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,233
What is this?

498
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,238
No. No.

499
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,675
Oh, wow.

500
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,544
Hey, Gus.

501
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,213
Gus!

502
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,015
Yes?

503
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,254
Whoever did this
was committed to their art.

504
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,697
Get to class.

505
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,566
This is not a gallery.

506
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,767
And that's not art.

507
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,044
Move it.

508
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,981
"Rules aren't for everyone."

509
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,582
What did you just say?

510
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,988
"Rules aren't for everyone."

511
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,123
Rule number 11,
"no loitering."

512
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,658
Move it, people.

513
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,130
Grak-tung!

514
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,172
Hey, Miller!
Hey!

515
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,777
What are you staring at,
crap-a-dukian?

516
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,546
Nothing.

517
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,882
Uh-oh. You know
what that is?

518
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,586
That's the kickter scale,
and it's acting up.

519
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,621
You know,
it's still a good day.

520
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,056
Okay, everybody.

521
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,692
Time for our daily dose
of morning propaganda.

522
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,563
Rules, regulations,
respect.

523
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,599
Rules. Regulations.
Respect.
Principal Dwight?

524
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,105
Principal Dwight?

525
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,775
We're live.

526
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:18,842
Oh, my god.

527
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,914
Good morning,
hills village.

528
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,916
You may have noticed
on your way into school today

529
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,618
that many surfaces
were covered

530
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,353
in brightly-colored
pieces of paper.

531
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:37,061
This was a horrible act
of vandalism.

532
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,963
Rest assured,
i will find the hooligans

533
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,065
<i> who defaced our school</i>
<i> in this manner.</i>

534
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,067
And when I find them,
they'll be sorry

535
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,735
because I will
punish them in ways

536
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,804
that I haven't even
dreamed up yet.

537
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,906
<i> There will be</i>
<i> no further distractions</i>

538
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,641
<i> to our b.L.A.A.R</i>
<i> preparation.</i>

539
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,309
The microphone
is on the Fritz, sir.

540
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,677
You may wanna wrap it up.

541
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,949
<i> I...Like...My...Big...But...</i>

542
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,352
<i> Do...You...Like...</i>
<i> My...Big...But...</i>

543
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,054
Oh, my god.

544
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,356
<i> Remember what I always say,</i>

545
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:09,293
do whatever I tell you,
every single time.

546
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,394
<i> I thought that went</i>
<i> all right.</i>

547
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,750
I can tell you want
my '65 Shelby cobra,
but guess what?

548
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,386
It's mine.

549
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:36,854
I won it.

550
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,389
I won it.

551
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,990
And then you took it.
No.

552
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,358
You won it with my money.

553
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,127
So technically, it's mine.

554
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,796
Plus, I beat you
at speed of light.

555
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,665
Boo-yah!

556
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,400
Hey, look!
It's a talking bear!

557
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:50,968
Why do you insist
on calling me that?

558
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,270
You know my name is Carl.
Carl.

559
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,072
Well, a,

560
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:58,742
"Carl" rhymes with "snarl,"
which is something bears do.

561
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,146
And, b, you're, like,
abnormally hairy.

562
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,014
Just hurry up, all right?

563
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,983
<i> Game of thrones</i>
starts in 10 minutes.

564
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,252
And if I miss the recap,
I'm totally screwed.

565
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:09,987
Wait, but we haven't even
had dessert yet.

566
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,122
That's the best part!

567
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,957
You better change your mindset
on this whole dessert thing,
all right?

568
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,759
Or you're gonna end up
as fat as your dog.

569
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,994
That's probably
why you're so farty.

570
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,862
Your face is farty.

571
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,966
And Calvin giggles
is just big-boned.

572
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,035
Just chew so we can
get out of here, huh?

573
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,005
Hi, folks, I'm Dana.

574
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:31,175
I'll be taking over for Sandy.
Her shift just ended.

575
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,443
Would you like me
to bring the check?

576
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,044
Yes.
No.

577
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,746
I thought
you were in a hurry.

578
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,147
Yeah.

579
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,183
A hurry to get
you adorable kids

580
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:42,052
the best dessert
Dave and buster's
has to offer, huh?

581
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,921
Got my friend's kids
with me today.

582
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,090
Did you just say
your "friend's kids"?

583
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,325
Tell you what. Just get
whatever you guys want
for dessert, all right?

584
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,993
Provided it's not
caviar, huh?

585
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,895
I'll go grab
the dessert menus.

586
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,465
All right! Dessert.
She's gonna grab
the dessert menus.

587
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,066
All right, here's the deal.

588
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,103
I am gonna go take a dump.

589
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,337
Ew.

590
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,139
Don't screw anything up,
all right?

591
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,483
Oh!

592
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,285
There we go.
That's the stuff.

593
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,158
Salt and pepper. Nice!

594
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,494
Hey, slow down!

595
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,895
Where you going, huh?

596
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,197
I just wanna get
some honey, honey.

597
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,499
Oh, honey?

598
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,300
I got your honey right here.

599
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,902
All right!

600
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,172
Oh, what the... ow!

601
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,375
Ah! What is that smell?

602
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,392
This gets me
so mad!

603
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,060
I have an idea.

604
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,862
Let's pee in his Cologne.

605
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,297
No, we can't do that.

606
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,100
That would be way too much
of an improvement.

607
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,836
Why are there so many jerks
in my life right now?

608
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,171
I don't know.

609
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:09,473
Whoa! It looks like
we've just received

610
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,441
a generous donation
from one of them.

611
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,210
What?

612
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,478
Is that...

613
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,513
Yep.
Bear's credit card number.

614
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,016
How nice of bear
to fund phase two

615
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,285
of operation
rules aren't for everyone.

616
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,887
And maybe
some new kicks.

617
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,258
Forget drawing.

618
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,427
You may be missing
your calling
as an electrical engineer.

619
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,029
Or a bank robber.

620
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,034
Seriously, I think
I'm learning more
by breaking the rules

621
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,102
than I ever have by preparing
for some dumb test.

622
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,281
Oh, no! No!

623
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,044
Dude.

624
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,946
I can't believe people
are actually into our work.

625
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,015
Bro. We're trending, rafe!

626
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,384
This is the work
of the legends.

627
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,451
Hey.

628
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,188
Done.

629
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,691
I wish there was one person

630
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,159
who I could
share all this with.

631
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,594
What, like, besides me?

632
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:14,331
No way! Way too risky, man.
Like, come on!

633
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,401
"Dear diary, I'm a loser."

634
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,202
It's not a...

635
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,671
Diary.

636
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,439
Later, khatcha-borian.

637
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,415
Dream of Jeanne.

638
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,683
Can I have one?
Oh, yeah. Sure.

639
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:34,418
Dream of Jeanne.
Thanks.

640
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,322
Hey, you're that guy.

641
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,123
No, I'm not.

642
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,491
The guy who clapped
for my speech?

643
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,460
Oh, yeah! That was me.
I'm rafe.

644
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,195
Bam. That's one vote.
That was easy.

645
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,699
Can you believe
that something this cool

646
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,467
is actually happening
at our school?

647
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,502
You think the graffiti is,
like, really cool?

648
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,205
Well, not just that.
I think the post-it
thing was amazing too.

649
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,307
And Dwight's hair.
Genius.

650
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,608
I just love that
someone has the guts,

651
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,177
you know, to take on
the establishment.

652
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,478
Yeah.

653
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
And I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

654
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,983
Check out how many likes
it got on my Facebook page.

655
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,184
Whoa!

656
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,019
Yeah.

657
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,687
That means that it's actually
spreading to other schools.

658
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,590
Hey, um...

659
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,092
Do you wanna
know a secret? I...

660
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,593
Anonymous.
You're anonymous.

661
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,562
Actually...

662
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,697
I'm really just
digging your boots!

663
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,199
Good job. Good choice.

664
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,667
Thanks.

665
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,102
So what are you doing
after school next Friday?

666
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,138
Do you wanna go on a...

667
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,639
Fundraiser.
Yeah, a date.

668
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,175
A fundraiser. Totally.
That's what I was thinking.

669
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,543
Yeah, I love funds.

670
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,278
And raising things.
Raising things is fun.

671
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,414
What are we
fund and raising for?

672
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,316
Greenpeace.
Love them.

673
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,751
Have you seen that
heartbreaking YouTube video

674
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,419
about how the polar bears
are getting stranded

675
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,521
on melting ice floes?
Yeah.

676
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,056
And I'm trying to make
a difference here,

677
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,424
but it's just so crazy
with the studying

678
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,625
for the testing
of the b.L.A.A.R.

679
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,527
And everyone's just so busy.

680
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,462
If I hear one more thing
about the b.L.A.A.R.,

681
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:56,066
I'm gonna "blaarf"
just, like, everywhere.

682
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,568
Me, too.

683
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,570
So, uh, you're in?

684
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,407
Absolutely. I mean,
i can "bear-ly" wait.

685
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,742
Good.

686
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,511
No, that was a dumb joke.
It was "bear-ly" because...

687
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,180
Oh! Okay, yeah.
I see what you did there.

688
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,049
Actually,
that was kind of funny.

689
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,618
Okay, so yeah.

690
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,553
I'll see you then.
Okay.

691
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,188
Okay. Bye.
Yeah. Bye.

692
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,159
Dude!
You almost blew our cover!

693
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,627
I'm sorry.
She was just way cool, dude!

694
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,829
You gotta be careful, okay?
Opening up to people can...

695
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,531
Well, it can get you hurt.

696
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,199
Yeah.
Am I right?

697
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,600
Yes. You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

698
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,736
I'm sorry. But, hey,
you can always trust me.

699
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,238
One for all
and all for one.

700
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,540
We'll just massage this in

701
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,775
and get you back
to your natural color.

702
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,677
Just lean back, relax,

703
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,546
and let me take care
of everything.

704
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,514
Relax? I can't relax.

705
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,316
Have you seen
this website discussion?

706
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,818
It's gone bacterial.

707
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,220
Ugh! Even worse,
ever since those punks

708
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,222
started disrupting
everything,

709
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,757
the kids have been
slacking off.

710
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,759
This morning
i heard laughing.

711
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,427
In the library.

712
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,862
Laughing? What do you mean?
The "out loud" kind?

713
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:01,264
Mmm-hmm.

714
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,699
And you know,
the test scores have really
been slipping this past month.

715
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,568
Ever since this rule breaking
got started.

716
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,203
No.
Yes.

717
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,471
And the b.L.A.A.R.
Is right around the corner.

718
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:08,472
We can't afford
to have our students

719
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,273
losing their concentration.

720
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,709
Getting the best scores on
the test is all that matters.

721
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,211
Like I always say,

722
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,646
"teach to the test,
not to the kids."

723
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,315
Yeah. Well,
it's a relief to be

724
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,318
around someone who gets it.

725
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,753
You know, I think we need
a larger room for detention.

726
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,322
The library's
not good anymore.

727
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,723
Maybe the cafeteria
plus the gymnasium?

728
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:27,891
Mmm-hmm.

729
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,860
Although,
gymnasium comes in handy...

730
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,365
Oh, my god!

731
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,235
That could've been me.

732
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:43,607
All right! Shon

733
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,709
has a homework question
about the food chain.

734
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,712
So why don't we band together
as a class and help him. Shon?

735
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,549
Shon, are you having
a panic attack?

736
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,651
Yes.
Yeah? Okay,
so just breathe.

737
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,821
And remember the question
that you asked me earlier.

738
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,290
Probably won't show up
on the b.L.A.A.R.

739
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,392
The b.L.A.A.R does not
dictate everything

740
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,394
that you need to know
from the real world.

741
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,896
Now we're together for
a half hour every morning.

742
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,330
We might as well
make it count.

743
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,566
Rafe.
You spend all day drawing.

744
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,834
Why don't you
put that to good use

745
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,502
and come draw us
a food chain?

746
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,737
No, I'm good. I mean...

747
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,605
I only work
in pen anyways, so...

748
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,441
No. I've seen your homework.

749
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,710
It's done exclusively
in invisible ink.

750
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,879
Come on.
Draw us the food chain.

751
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,385
Walk us through it.

752
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,761
Okay, well, the sun

753
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:42,732
<i> shines down onto the grass,</i>
<i> which keeps growing</i>

754
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,435
until a cow
comes along and eats it.

755
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,971
Always grass. Never pizza.

756
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,673
That's the primary consumer.

757
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,575
The cow
gets nice and big.

758
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,443
Huh? Hmm...

759
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,645
According to this,
a surprise pizza party

760
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,681
is being held
for me right there!

761
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,783
<i> And then it gets taken</i>
<i> to a slaughterhouse.</i>

762
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,252
Great. Now I gotta
act surprised.

763
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,357
Okay, I'm surprised.

764
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,926
And we use it to make
hamburgers and all that.

765
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,429
<i> One day...</i>
Hey!

766
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:15,365
<i> A hungry bully with</i>
<i> a bad haircut comes by.</i>

767
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,934
<i> Eats the hamburgers.</i>

768
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,938
That's the secondary
consumer.

769
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,773
But he keeps
eating the hamburgers.

770
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,242
<i> He keeps eating,</i>
<i> and eating,</i>

771
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,377
<i> and eating</i>
<i> until he gets so fat,</i>

772
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,880
<i> that he just</i>
<i> sort of explodes.</i>

773
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,449
Ugh!

774
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,991
Uh... but, that is good
for the maggots.

775
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,826
Yay!
Whoo!

776
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,394
Just like chicken.

777
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,363
Ooh, try the butt cheek.
No, thank you.

778
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:46,363
I'm having the pu pu platter.

779
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:50,867
<i> And then, in turn,</i>
<i> enrich the grassy field,</i>

780
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,737
<i> which another cow</i>
<i> comes along and eats.</i>

781
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:57,474
Ooh, an invitation
to a surprise party?

782
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,975
Outstanding!

783
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,380
So, um, yeah. That's, uh...

784
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,882
That's my food chain.

785
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,684
That is...

786
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:10,687
Very detailed
and super awesome.

787
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:11,855
Thank you.

788
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,391
All right, everybody.

789
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,892
You know
what that sound means.

790
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,694
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

791
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,062
Let's go. Out, out, out.

792
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,432
Hey. Khatcha-drawian.

793
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,701
I'm gonna roundhouse you
in the face.

794
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,737
Do it.
Do what?

795
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,039
Roundhouse him.

796
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,607
Roundhouse him in the face.

797
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,908
'Cause I don't think
you can.

798
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,343
I don't think
it's physically possible

799
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,979
to get your leg that high

800
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,781
from where you're standing.

801
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:40,350
Well... uh...

802
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:41,518
I know I can't.
If I tried to do it,

803
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,386
my groin would snap
like that.

804
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,721
Of course I can.

805
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:47,424
But I just can't do it now
because, uh...

806
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,827
I forgot to renew
the lethal weapon

807
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,529
registration on my feet.

808
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,597
Yeah, that's a bummer.
I hate it when that happens.

809
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,867
Yeah. So...
Yeah.

810
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,341
Gotta go.
Okay.

811
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,542
We'll rain check it.

812
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,681
Look, there's no easy way
to break up with someone.

813
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,351
But if you feel that
you weren't into it anymore,

814
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,953
then you did the right thing.
You had to tell her.

815
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,955
You know?
You gotta do you.

816
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,590
That's the most
important thing.

817
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,725
I learned that
from my ex-wife.

818
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,927
Hey, uh, rafe,

819
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,129
that was some drawing
back there.

820
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,630
Thanks. It was nothing.

821
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,033
No, it was
very much something.

822
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,836
What's a kid like you
doing lumped in with
all these other kids?

823
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,609
It's been a rough
couple of years for me.

824
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,880
I lost my brother.

825
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,048
Cancer.

826
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,916
Oh, man.

827
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,787
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

828
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,022
You guys are making me
a little nervous
standing here.

829
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,624
Remember rule number 34.

830
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,059
Don't touch the trophy case?

831
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,861
Very, very good.

832
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,095
See what a favor I did you,

833
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,764
getting rid
of that awful notebook

834
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:01,931
so you can make more
productive use of your time?

835
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,806
Is there something you'd like
to say to me right now?

836
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,783
You're in trouble.
Give me your hand
real quick,

837
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:22,018
'cause there's something
going on here.
What is this? Oh!

838
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,753
Oh!

839
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,626
Bear is mauling our mother.

840
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,094
We've got to do something.

841
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,829
Hey, mom! Open my present.

842
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,564
Oh, I gotta go.

843
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,065
Let me see that. Okay.

844
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,467
Ah...

845
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,003
Ooh. Presents.
Let's see.

846
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,138
Oh, it's an apron.

847
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,740
What's this?

848
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:46,810
"Hello, is it me
you're cooking for?"

849
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,145
- Isn't that funny?
- This is so funny.

850
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,613
Where'd you find that?

851
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,648
Well, I had someone
make it for you.

852
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,749
You did?
Yeah.

853
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,083
You understand that?

854
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,051
Of course,
that's why I got it.

855
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,586
Get it?
I get it.

856
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,954
Honey, that's so cute.
I love it.

857
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,789
Took me a bit,
but I got it. I think.

858
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,924
So "looking for"
is "cooking for."

859
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,559
Yeah.
That's awesome.

860
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,061
Hello. I'm James,
the manager.
Hi.

861
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,730
Can we just
keep it down, a lot?

862
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,466
Oh.
This is not Chuck E. Cheese.

863
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,468
Shh!

864
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,970
Big guy. Shh!

865
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,672
Can I have another root beer?

866
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,940
You've had enough sugar.

867
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,877
Jeez.
Jeez.

868
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,178
He was scary.

869
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,246
Do me a favor though,
guys, seriously.

870
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,114
Don't embarrass me again.

871
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,649
We just have to
talk like this for

872
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,084
the rest of the night, okay?
No problem.

873
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,519
Okay?

874
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,221
You know, honey,
i love my present.

875
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,256
You always know
how to make me laugh.

876
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,825
Thank you.
This one's my present.

877
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,661
Oh! Homemade.

878
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,829
Classy.

879
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,036
Rafe, I just...

880
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,939
It's beautiful.

881
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,909
Honey, I love it.
You're so talented.
Thank you.

882
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,078
You guys, you're too much.

883
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,914
Love you so much!

884
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,682
Wait. Where am I?

885
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,150
Love you.

886
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,519
Well, hold on a second now.

887
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:03,753
Wait till you see
what I got for you.

888
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,154
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

889
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,956
Uh-oh.

890
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,858
Jules,

891
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,661
when I think about us,
i think about one word.

892
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,264
Cramazing.

893
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,966
Crazy amazing.
Right.

894
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,701
More like "crawful."
Yeah.

895
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,207
Oh.

896
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,009
Carl...

897
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:27,176
Uh-huh.

898
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,278
That must have
been expensive.

899
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,046
It was!

900
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,048
Yeah. But guess what?

901
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,751
You're worth it, baby.

902
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:38,221
Wow.
So, what do you say,
my lady?

903
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,025
Will you marry me?

904
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,698
Yes. Yes.
Hmm?

905
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,133
Yes.
Yes.

906
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:51,301
You said yes.
I did.

907
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,735
Yes! Come here.

908
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,671
Yes! Yes!

909
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:55,972
You know, I was thinking,

910
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,774
since I'm over
at the house so much,

911
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:00,176
and I'm always helping out
with the kids and everything,

912
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,779
I ought to just move in.
You know?

913
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,080
I mean, I'd save
a ton on mileage.

914
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,316
And tax-wise,
it's a no-brainer.

915
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,018
Well, I mean, if we're gonna
get married, it seems like...

916
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,054
Yes.
Right. Then it's settled!

917
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,589
Yes! Come here, you!

918
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,757
Oh!

919
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,726
Oh, sorry.

920
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,962
Sorry about that, sporto.

921
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:22,065
Oh, hey, your card
got ruined. Bummer.

922
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,001
Hmm?

923
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,205
I'm moving in!

924
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,941
You're welcome.

925
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,243
What's the matter, sport?
Not hungry?

926
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,348
Ugh!

927
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,917
I'll show you
a real breakfast.

928
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,686
Honey!

929
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,658
Ugh!
This stuff is delicious.

930
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,126
Good talk, buddy.

931
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,197
Nice!

932
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,367
Sweet!

933
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,669
Georgia!

934
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,010
Your fat dog peed all over
my Joey banks.

935
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:08,911
I have to admit something.

936
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,346
It wasn't just him.

937
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,815
I did it too.

938
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:17,086
All right, listen up, twerps.
And listen good.

939
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,421
I'm here to stay.

940
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:20,256
And that smile
on your mom's face

941
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:21,758
that you're all
so happy to see?

942
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,860
I put that there.

943
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:25,361
So unless you wanna
be responsible

944
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,829
for her unhappiness,

945
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,765
I suggest
you check your attitude

946
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,167
and your bladder
at the door.

947
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,936
Because now, you're guests

948
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,773
in the bear cave.

949
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,875
At least he's embracing
the whole "bear" thing now.

950
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,945
Hey, what do these go with?

951
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,049
They're zebra print.
They go with everything!

952
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,052
We're doomed.

953
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,989
I gotta do
something, man.

954
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,924
Well, one jerk
at a time, rafe.

955
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,993
If I've learned anything
from <i> call of duty,</i>

956
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:59,095
besides how to curse
in 13 languages,

957
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:01,698
it's that we've got to
complete this operation

958
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,332
before we launch up
the new one.

959
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,735
I know. I just wish she could
see what a jerk he is

960
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:08,104
underneath all that
fancy stuff.

961
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,207
Any last words?

962
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,444
I think he says "gurgle."

963
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,214
Hey, after this,

964
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,316
I think we should
tackle rule 86.

965
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,053
Are you kidding?
Let's eighty-six
the 86 talk, all right?

966
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,388
The longer you wait,

967
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,323
the scarier
it's going to be.

968
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:30,927
Uh, hand me the eel.

969
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,162
Yeah.

970
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,999
Somebody better
update Wikipedia.

971
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,736
You wanna know why?
'Cause we're making
history, bro.

972
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:47,477
What the...

973
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,879
Fish!

974
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,223
Way to go, bro.

975
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:01,958
Oh, my god.

976
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,828
Who would do this?

977
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,464
Gus, we have a situation
in the lobby!

978
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,299
Bring a net!

979
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,036
Get to class!

980
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,013
The fish, I can understand.
But why did it
have to be an eel?

981
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:26,382
It looks just like the eel
i had when I was a boy.

982
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:29,218
And that thing shocked me
every time I tried to pet him.

983
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,920
All right!
I gotta go on live.

984
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:31,988
Right now.

985
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,123
Okay. Um...

986
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,391
Did you fix this thing?

987
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,860
Yes, but... uh...
But what?

988
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,863
That shirt...

989
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,166
I'm just saying,
it might be a problem, sir.

990
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,401
I didn't come here for
a fashion consultation,
galleta.

991
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,103
Just roll tape!

992
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,909
Attention, falcons!

993
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,443
<i> As you know, some punks</i>

994
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,213
<i> have declared war</i>
<i> on your education.</i>

995
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,285
And your education,
through me,

996
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,420
<i> is about to start</i>
<i> fighting back!</i>

997
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,558
Their punky little pranks
and stunts

998
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,226
have distracted our students,

999
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:13,062
<i> damaged our reputation</i>
<i> on the world wide web,</i>

1000
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,464
<i> endangered our</i>
<i> number one status</i>

1001
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,201
<i> and traumatized an eel.</i>

1002
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,903
<i> And so today, it stops.</i>

1003
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,572
<i> If these little vandals</i>
<i> don't like</i>

1004
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:24,440
<i> playing by our old rules,</i>

1005
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,975
<i> well, I guess</i>
<i> I'll have to come up</i>

1006
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,310
<i> with some new ones.</i>

1007
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,912
<i> Here come some new rules!</i>

1008
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:31,948
Rule number 137,

1009
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,583
no more going
to the bathroom.

1010
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,351
The bathrooms
will be locked from now on.

1011
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,086
You'll have to hold it
until you get home.

1012
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,455
I've never been wild
about people using
the bathroom here.

1013
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:39,455
And now, it's over.

1014
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:43,593
<i> Violators will be forced</i>
<i> to stay after school</i>

1015
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:47,163
<i> and clean the toilets.</i>

1016
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:51,367
New rule 138, there will be
no after-school activities.

1017
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,603
That bell rings
and you go straight home.

1018
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:55,004
You'll want to anyway,

1019
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:56,639
because you'll have to
go to the bathroom

1020
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,207
pretty bad.

1021
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,309
I'll also be dissolving
school government.

1022
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,178
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1023
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,614
It's been a puppet regime
all this time anyway.

1024
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:07,483
<i> No debate, no speech,</i>
<i> no clubs of any kind.</i>

1025
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,952
Including
the audio-visual club.

1026
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,087
Oh, sh...

1027
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,227
<i> Don't you see, rafe?</i>

1028
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:22,131
<i> My school, my rules.</i>

1029
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,604
B.L.A.A.R.

1030
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,640
Sorry, we're at
nerd capacity.

1031
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:33,609
Hey! <i> Occupado.</i>

1032
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,244
B.L.A.A.R.

1033
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,415
B.L.A.A.R.

1034
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,022
B.L.A.A.R.

1035
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,296
B.L.A.A.R.

1036
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,473
B.L.A.A.R.

1037
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,178
Hey!

1038
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,961
Well, look at this.

1039
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,462
We're one week out
from the test,

1040
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,398
and I do not like the scores
on this practice exam.

1041
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,735
78% proficient in English
and 76 in math.

1042
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,338
Mmm.
These are not winning scores.

1043
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,041
I've been growing my
number one bush for a decade.

1044
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,077
And I do not intend
to trim it.

1045
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,346
Ever!

1046
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:44,680
See, there's the problem
right there.

1047
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,716
Rotating. Like a planet.

1048
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,718
Remember, there's no...

1049
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,053
Oh, uranus is down.
Miller, stop trying
to stab uranus.

1050
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,688
The good kids
are working their tails off,

1051
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,523
and these remedials
are fooling around

1052
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:57,593
instead of memorizing
and studying.

1053
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,729
I wonder what would happen
if we excluded

1054
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:02,298
Mr. teller's students
from the test.

1055
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,302
Look at that. Wow. We jump
right back up to number one.

1056
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:09,271
Too bad we can't stop them
from taking the test.

1057
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,541
Oh, yeah.

1058
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,345
We could stop them
from taking the test.

1059
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,083
Ida, I could kiss you!

1060
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:23,753
Hey, Gus!

1061
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:25,388
Would you fix
that farting bell?

1062
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,490
I want my ding-dong back!

1063
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,258
We are all on thin ice.

1064
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,493
Help save the polar bears.
Ms. galleta.

1065
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,328
I thought I was very clear.

1066
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,530
All club meetings have been
canceled until further notice.

1067
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,798
And that includes this...
What is this?

1068
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,166
What club is this?

1069
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:38,768
This isn't just some meeting.

1070
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,504
Polar bears' lives
are at stake here.

1071
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:44,407
Oh, please.
These bears need to learn
to take care of themselves.

1072
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,409
It's not like the ice caps
are going anywhere.

1073
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,110
That's exactly
what it's like!

1074
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:49,545
Sounds like I need to talk
to your science teacher.

1075
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,280
None of that has been proven.

1076
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,516
Oh, rafe,
I'm so glad you came.

1077
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:55,117
Of course. I mean,
i wouldn't miss it.

1078
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,752
Well, you did miss it.
This meeting is over.

1079
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,255
Ms. galleta is violating
one of my new rules.

1080
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:01,657
You're seriously trying to
put some stupid rule

1081
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,260
over the lives
of innocent bear cubs?

1082
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:06,762
My rules aren't stupid.
Your bears are stupid.

1083
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,764
Nobody told them to live
on something that melts.

1084
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,499
And these animals
are hardly innocent.

1085
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:13,536
Your beloved polar bears
would kill you for a peanut.

1086
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:14,670
Or whatever they eat.

1087
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,138
What do polar bears eat?

1088
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,373
Ice?

1089
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,108
No way of knowing.

1090
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,409
And I am not
an unreasonable man,
by the way.

1091
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,744
I might have overlooked
one violation,

1092
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,246
but two violations
has pushed it too far.

1093
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,815
This shirt of yours
goes against the dress code

1094
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:28,818
as stipulated
in rule number 22.

1095
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,853
So you've got detention.
Two weeks.

1096
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,722
Principal Dwight,
you can't dictate
what we wear after school.

1097
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,658
You're on my campus.

1098
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,160
And when you're on my campus,
you're under my rules.

1099
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:40,729
You're very close to violating
rule number one.

1100
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,164
Respect your principal.

1101
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:43,532
That's the most
important rule.

1102
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,134
That's why
i made it number one.

1103
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,669
Do you want
a detention too, huh?

1104
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,274
No, sir.

1105
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,176
I've got infinite detentions
to hand out.

1106
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:55,578
You sure you don't want one?

1107
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,779
No, sir.

1108
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,848
Okay. Well,
watch the attitude.

1109
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,284
Because I'd say,
the only thing around here
that's on thin ice...

1110
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,521
Is you. See?

1111
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,625
'Cause you've been
talking about thin ice.

1112
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,528
And that's a way of saying
that someone is in trouble.

1113
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,603
I don't know
what's going on with rafe.

1114
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:22,671
He didn't even try
my candied bacon tarts

1115
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,206
with goat cheese ganache.

1116
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,876
Ooh! More for me.

1117
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:28,410
You know, I just wish I knew

1118
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,613
what was going on
with him lately.

1119
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:33,315
Jules, I say this with love.

1120
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,186
Rafe is one
messed up little dude.

1121
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:40,756
No, he's not. No.
He's dealing with
a lot of stuff.

1122
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,324
Well, who isn't?

1123
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,260
I mean, I'm not,
'cause I'm awesome.

1124
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:47,229
But I do think little dudes
that are too attached
to their moms...

1125
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,531
Please, no. What?

1126
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,199
They're more considerate,
and kinder,

1127
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:51,634
and have empathy
towards others?

1128
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:52,868
Exactly.

1129
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,870
They're soft.

1130
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:58,407
Look, I'm just saying.
I think therapy
might be a good idea.

1131
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,509
You know, a professional
that he can talk to,

1132
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,279
to help him
deal with things better.

1133
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:05,381
Yeah. Maybe.

1134
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:09,385
You really think it could
help if he saw someone
on a weekly basis?

1135
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,820
Weekly,
on a daily basis maybe.

1136
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,956
Huh?
Hmm?

1137
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,791
Yeah. No, you know what?

1138
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,526
I'll do the research
for you, huh?

1139
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,961
That way,
you can focus on work.

1140
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,629
Really?
Yeah.

1141
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,932
Babe...

1142
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:24,667
I'm here for you.

1143
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:26,435
I have to tell you,
it's such a relief

1144
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,805
to have someone else
to share all the...

1145
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:32,308
I'm sorry. Game's on.
Oh! Oh.

1146
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,777
Yeah. Thanks.
Get back to the game.

1147
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,445
Okay. Yeah.

1148
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,556
Phone lady,

1149
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,793
find military schools
for kids you don't like.

1150
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,428
<i> I find</i>
<i> no applebee's in your area.</i>

1151
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,563
That's not what I...
I didn't... hey!

1152
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,800
All right, search for
ways to get rid of kids
that aren't yours.

1153
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,236
<i> Calling mommy.</i>

1154
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,004
No. Don't call mommy mobile.

1155
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:04,306
Stop, stop, stop!
Hang up! Hang up!

1156
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:06,008
Hey, mom!

1157
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,811
<i> Carl,</i>
<i> is that you again?</i>
No.

1158
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,382
I think we're breaking up.

1159
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,585
I'm breaking up.

1160
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,320
Gotta go.

1161
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:20,623
It's too easy.

1162
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,363
I'm just sick and tired
of all these bullies

1163
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:28,731
thinking they can do
whatever they want.

1164
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:31,367
No risk, no reward.
But we have to fight.

1165
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,537
Now that's
a musketeer thing to say.

1166
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,982
You ready to witness
my greatest masterpiece?

1167
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:48,784
Hey, rafe,
are you okay up there?

1168
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,553
Because if you fall, I am not
giving you mouth-to-mouth.

1169
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:55,057
Good.
Thanks in advance.

1170
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,326
All of this for a girl?

1171
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:58,694
Is she really worth it?

1172
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,897
Leo,

1173
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:04,633
for Jeanne galleta,
i would walk through fire

1174
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,934
just to see her smile.

1175
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,707
Grak-tung.

1176
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,677
Grak-tung.

1177
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,418
Rafe.

1178
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,787
Jeez, Georgia, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

1179
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,488
Where have you been?

1180
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,390
It's none of your business.
Now go to bed.

1181
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:29,725
Can't sleep.

1182
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:31,560
Wanna know why?

1183
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,996
Because I'm worried
about you.

1184
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:37,566
Are you happy? You've turned
me into a grandma.

1185
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,935
Georgia, you're gonna need
at least, like, five cats

1186
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,071
before you're officially
a grandma.

1187
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,839
Rafe, this is serious.

1188
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,611
Georgia, don't cry.

1189
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:50,846
Okay? I'm fine.

1190
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,949
No, you're not.
You're secretive.

1191
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:57,786
And when you're not sad,
you're angry.

1192
00:55:57,788 --> 00:56:00,723
I came in here tonight
to warn you.

1193
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:03,092
I don't know what
you're up to every night,

1194
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:05,461
but it has to stop,
whatever it is.

1195
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,496
Because if bear catches you,

1196
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:10,966
he's gonna ship you off
to some military school
for bad kids.

1197
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,601
Wait, what?

1198
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,137
I heard him talking about it
with mom tonight.

1199
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:17,840
He has her believing
you're really messed up.

1200
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,842
He's the one
that's messed up.

1201
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:21,910
Rafe, listen to me.

1202
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,612
He has it out for us.

1203
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,683
And I know I talk a big game,

1204
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,486
but I can't handle him
all by myself.

1205
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,124
Please, rafe. Promise me.

1206
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:37,893
No more trouble. Please.

1207
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:39,795
Fine.

1208
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:40,863
I promise.

1209
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:42,398
No more trouble.

1210
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,612
Thanks, dork.

1211
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:58,514
Yeah, whatever, loser.

1212
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,623
Dude, this next one is gonna
put us over a million hits.

1213
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,791
I'm not gonna do it,
all right?

1214
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:10,492
I promised Georgia.

1215
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,060
But you gotta do it.

1216
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,430
The b.L.A.A.R.'S tomorrow.
We can't let up now.

1217
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,000
Listen. They fixed the bell.

1218
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:20,602
It's gonna be like none
of this even happened.

1219
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,438
Look, Leo, we're just kids.

1220
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,040
Okay? Dwight was
always gonna win.

1221
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,176
But what happened to
making a difference?

1222
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:29,445
What happened to
not being pushed around,

1223
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:30,813
and fighting
for your freedom?

1224
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:32,915
Okay, Dwight, bear, Miller?
They happened.

1225
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:35,083
And I'm not trying
to make a difference.

1226
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:36,985
I'm trying to make it through
middle school.

1227
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,022
<i> Well, gang,</i>

1228
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:42,925
this is going to be harder
on you than it is on me.

1229
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,828
I'm afraid I have reason
to believe that this classroom

1230
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,163
is the epicenter
for the vicious pranks

1231
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,666
our school has endured
this semester.

1232
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:51,967
In fact,

1233
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,703
this entire class
is under suspicion.

1234
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,939
That's a pretty serious
accusation there, Dwight.

1235
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:59,675
Well, it's a pretty
serious offense.

1236
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,610
And I have proof.

1237
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,145
Come with me.

1238
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,951
Spray paint.

1239
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:10,819
Pink hair dye.

1240
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,187
Fish food.

1241
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:13,822
Post-it notes.

1242
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,023
And balls.

1243
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,996
Effective immediately,

1244
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,233
all of your students are
suspended for one week!

1245
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,502
What? No!

1246
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,704
Wait a minute. These kids
maybe troublemakers,

1247
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,138
they may not be "a" students,

1248
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,874
a lot of them smell weird,

1249
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,609
but they are
smart enough to know

1250
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:36,211
you don't leave hard evidence
inside their lockers.

1251
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,113
These are hardly
the masterminds

1252
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:39,848
of such
an extravagant prank.

1253
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,917
If anything, I would say,

1254
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,719
that this seems like a setup.

1255
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:46,622
Are you insinuating
that this is a setup?

1256
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:50,092
Yeah. That's why I just said
this seems like a setup.

1257
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:52,628
I don't like that.
Because it almost sounds like

1258
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,162
you're thinking
this is a setup.

1259
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,864
I think
before we do anything,

1260
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,866
like suspend anybody
or anything like that,

1261
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,268
we talk to someone
who has some real authority,

1262
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,836
like superintendent hwang.

1263
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:02,604
Oh, I have real authority,
Mr. teller.

1264
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:04,206
I'm the principal
of this school.

1265
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:07,175
Yeah, but someone who has
real power to make decisions.

1266
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:09,578
That's what I have.
Power to make decisions.

1267
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,614
Let's talk
to the person that, like,
can make something happen.

1268
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:14,249
Mmm.

1269
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:15,884
You know, Mr. teller,

1270
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,853
your continued denials
in the face

1271
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:20,289
of this overwhelming
evidence

1272
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:23,759
leads me to believe that
you must be involved somehow.

1273
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:27,329
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to fire you.

1274
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,999
You have
a thousand other choices.

1275
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,801
I guess that's true.

1276
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,870
I probably do have a few other
choices, don't I?

1277
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:37,339
Well, the one I'm going with
is "fire you."

1278
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:40,309
All right, everyone, pack up
all of your things
while we call your parents.

1279
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,911
And, Mr. teller, good luck
finding another job.

1280
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:46,048
Without my recommendation,
I'm afraid.

1281
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,917
I'm tired of that guy
busting my balls.

1282
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,186
Yes, hello. I was thinking
of having a large

1283
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,221
number one
tattooed onto my back.

1284
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,657
Is it necessary
to make an appointment?

1285
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,327
Oh, okay. Well, what sorts
of openings do you...

1286
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:01,096
Um... I need to
call you back.

1287
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,331
Principal Dwight?

1288
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,166
What are you still
doing here?

1289
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:06,668
I did it.
You did what?

1290
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,338
You destroyed my book,
so I wanted to destroy yours.

1291
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,939
"Rules aren't for everyone."

1292
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,176
R-a-f-e, rafe. Me.

1293
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:16,945
What?
Are you not
making the connection?

1294
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:21,049
Well, I'm pretty sure
your name is spelled
with a "ph." "Phrafe."

1295
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,784
Your evidence is fake.

1296
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,323
Well, you know, phrafe,

1297
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:33,829
that evidence, uh,
could be real.

1298
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:36,798
And I've seen the way
those other kids treat you.

1299
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,334
We could just
make them go away.

1300
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:42,270
All you have to do
is keep your mouth shut.

1301
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,406
And you won't have to
be suspended.

1302
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,908
Let them take the fall.

1303
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,810
This whole thing
will be our little secret.

1304
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,714
We have a deal?

1305
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,120
You know what?

1306
01:00:58,122 --> 01:00:59,655
Do whatever you want to me,

1307
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,156
but keep everybody else
out of this.

1308
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,692
And give Mr. teller
his job back, or else.

1309
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,827
Or else what?

1310
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,062
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey!

1311
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,163
Don't step... whoa! Whoa!

1312
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,732
I'm gonna make it rain.

1313
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,834
No. Hey, no! No, no, no!

1314
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,336
No!

1315
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,847
I should have known
a remedial like you
would make a dumb choice!

1316
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,115
With this little stunt,

1317
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:28,750
you've just violated
rule number 28.

1318
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:30,419
No false fire alarms!

1319
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:35,123
Rafe katchadorian,
you are officially expelled!

1320
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,425
Permanently!

1321
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:40,095
Gus! Please turn off
these sprinklers!

1322
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:34,049
Not joking about my towel now,
are you, sport, huh?

1323
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:35,484
If I was a betting man,

1324
01:02:35,486 --> 01:02:37,085
and believe me, I am,

1325
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,387
I would've lost money on you.

1326
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:42,791
You hung in there way longer
than I thought you would've.

1327
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:44,326
But, in the end,

1328
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:46,528
you're still the loser
i thought you were.

1329
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,199
<i> Will you just listen</i>
<i> to me? Please, mom.</i>

1330
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,334
Principal Dwight's
been out to get me

1331
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,169
since the first day of school.

1332
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,838
Or maybe you decided he was
gonna to give you a hard time

1333
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,540
and you were gonna
make it easy for him to do.

1334
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,976
That's not
what happened, okay?

1335
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,410
This principal is evil.

1336
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,379
And he suspended
the whole class

1337
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,248
even after I told him
that I'm the one
that bent the rules.

1338
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,218
Bent? Rafe, I think you did
a little more
than bend the rules.

1339
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,087
You're the one that told me
to think outside the box.

1340
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:13,455
But there's
a big difference between

1341
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,123
thinking outside the box

1342
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,992
and totally demolishing it.

1343
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,527
If you were having problems
with the principal,

1344
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,095
why didn't you
talk to me first?

1345
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,330
Because who'd believe
the word of some kid

1346
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:24,499
over the head
of the whole school?

1347
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:27,302
Honey, I would.
I'm your mom.

1348
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,838
I could've tried
talking to him at least.

1349
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,273
Now it's too late!

1350
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:34,176
This was the last school
that would accept you.

1351
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,944
What are we
supposed to do now?

1352
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:37,913
Find another school
in another state,
in another country?

1353
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,414
I'm out of options!

1354
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,052
And so, Carl found a school.
It's a boarding school.

1355
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:48,256
With some military aspects.

1356
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:50,892
You're sending me away
to some military school?

1357
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:52,127
Honey, I don't want to.

1358
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:53,929
But it's a place
for kids like you

1359
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,498
who have trouble
with authority.

1360
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,033
I thought I'd take
the day off tomorrow.

1361
01:03:58,035 --> 01:03:59,868
Maybe we could
just go take a look.

1362
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,104
Whatever.

1363
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,883
Oh, honey.

1364
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,589
We all miss him.

1365
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:23,191
Mom, you don't have to...
I miss him.

1366
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:26,294
Georgia does.

1367
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,068
Nothing's been the same
since the day he got sick.

1368
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,941
At times, I didn't know
if I could handle it.

1369
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,546
And...

1370
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:47,883
Your dad, well...

1371
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:50,252
He obviously
couldn't handle it.

1372
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,657
But it's worst for you.

1373
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,229
Brothers.

1374
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:05,166
You guys had such a bond.

1375
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:07,235
It was so different.

1376
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,205
And special.

1377
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,944
And I know sometimes

1378
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,079
you pretend
that he's still here.

1379
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,119
I know you pretend

1380
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,122
that Leo isn't gone.

1381
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,993
But he is, honey.

1382
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,330
Leo is gone.

1383
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,934
I'm sorry.

1384
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,142
I love you so much.

1385
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,311
I wish you knew how much.

1386
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,060
I love you, too.

1387
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,171
<i> Hey, bro.</i>
<i> Guess by now I've taken that</i>

1388
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:25,507
<i> vinlothian space cruiser</i>
<i> to the sky.</i>

1389
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:27,475
<i> And whatever</i>
<i> I'm doing now,</i>

1390
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:28,777
<i> it's probably</i>
<i> a lot cooler than</i>

1391
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:31,079
<i> what you're doing</i>
<i> stuck in school.</i>

1392
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:32,680
<i> Kidding.</i>

1393
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,582
<i> Don't tell anyone,</i>
<i> but I actually</i>

1394
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:37,152
<i> kind of liked</i>
<i> some of my classes.</i>

1395
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:39,087
<i> And since</i>
<i> I'm confessing stuff,</i>

1396
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:41,723
<i> I guess it's time to tell you</i>
<i> I've always looked up to you.</i>

1397
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,358
<i> You're super talented,</i>

1398
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,361
<i> and you can draw</i>
<i> and create anything.</i>

1399
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,830
<i> So imagine</i>
<i> something cool for me.</i>

1400
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:51,666
<i> And then live</i>
<i> something cool for you.</i>

1401
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:55,804
<i> Love, your younger brother,</i>
<i> by one year and two months,</i>

1402
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:57,072
<i> Leo.</i>

1403
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,214
You gonna let me in,
or what?

1404
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,417
Uh...

1405
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,553
Sorry. I wasn't expecting
anyone at the window.

1406
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:12,787
Yeah.

1407
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,190
I guess this is
kind of weird.

1408
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:17,125
What are you doing here?

1409
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:19,427
Well, you know,
i just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

1410
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,096
After today.

1411
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:22,330
Yeah, it was, um...

1412
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,265
It was a total crapstorm
of a day.

1413
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,267
Yeah, I know.

1414
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:28,603
But this was awesome.

1415
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,405
I kind of figured
it was you all along.

1416
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,808
But then, I confirmed it
when I watched this.

1417
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,682
And what is that?

1418
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:44,252
A vhs tape.
It's vintage.

1419
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,621
Basically, it's like a box
that's full of
an archaic system

1420
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,890
of gears, pulleys,
and tape

1421
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:50,658
that is then put
in a larger box,

1422
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,460
called a vcr,

1423
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:57,198
which then projects the images
onto the television.

1424
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,400
Wouldn't an iPhone
be easier?

1425
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:02,470
My phone
doesn't have enough memory
for this kind of project.

1426
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:07,275
I secretly filmed
the school as a part
of a documentary I did

1427
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:09,577
to find the creator
of rules aren't for everyone.

1428
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:11,913
Oh. Um...

1429
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,251
Well, you found me,
i guess.

1430
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:19,187
But too bad my art didn't
really change anything.

1431
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,624
Well, what I've got here
says you're wrong.

1432
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,228
You came prepared.

1433
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:30,798
Okay, so I put the camera
on top of a row of lockers
to get the best angle.

1434
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,834
<i> You ready to witness</i>
<i> my greatest masterpiece?</i>

1435
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,838
<i> Leo, for Jeanne galleta,</i>

1436
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,874
<i> I'd walk through fire</i>
<i> just to see her smile.</i>

1437
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,511
<i> Grak-tung. </i>

1438
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,514
Who's Leo?

1439
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:49,951
Um...

1440
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,388
Leo's my, um...

1441
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,657
He's my brother.

1442
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:58,760
But he's not just my brother.
He's my best friend.

1443
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:01,863
And he died.

1444
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,400
So, sometimes I like to

1445
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,270
imagine that
he's still here.

1446
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:11,673
Whenever I'm lonely.

1447
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:14,876
It's stupid.

1448
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:17,812
I think
it's the opposite of stupid.

1449
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:20,982
You know,
Picasso once said,

1450
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:24,719
"everything you can imagine
is real."

1451
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,855
I like that.

1452
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,624
Yeah, me too.

1453
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,996
Okay. Uh...
Look at this.

1454
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,366
There.

1455
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,268
<i> Gus, open up those lockers.</i>

1456
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,636
<i> I don't like this.</i>

1457
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:43,371
<i> Oh, really?</i>

1458
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:45,773
<i> I wonder how you'll like</i>
<i> unemployment. Open them.</i>

1459
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:48,376
<i> Do it. Spray paint.</i>

1460
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,648
<i> This is horrible. Very hard</i>
<i> to get out of the hair.</i>

1461
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,916
You have evidence!

1462
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,317
Oh, and get this.

1463
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,552
Not only does
b.L.A.A.R. Testing

1464
01:10:57,554 --> 01:10:59,420
give the school
bragging rights,

1465
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:02,023
but it also
gives the principal
a significant bonus.

1466
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:04,859
So suspending teller's class
was just about

1467
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,761
getting a better score
for the b.L.A.A.R.?

1468
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,730
Jeanne, we have to
stop the test tomorrow.

1469
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:11,032
And we're definitely
gonna need some help.

1470
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:13,768
I've got the numbers
of a few kids
with no school tomorrow.

1471
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,037
You text them,
and I'll set up
transportation.

1472
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,416
Georgia.

1473
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:30,418
Georgia, wake up.

1474
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,620
You feel like a drive?

1475
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,355
In the bear trap?

1476
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:35,790
Mmm-hmm.

1477
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,525
Yes, finally!

1478
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:39,394
But we need a diversion.

1479
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,864
I know just the thing.

1480
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:50,738
Georgia, Jeanne.

1481
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,307
Jeanne, Georgia.

1482
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,775
I like your glasses.

1483
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:55,543
I like your dog.

1484
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,078
Thanks.

1485
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,382
<i> Mmm, mmm, mmm!</i>

1486
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:15,063
Ready, set, go,
Mr. giggles.

1487
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,939
Well, well, well.

1488
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,774
If it isn't
the great fatsby.

1489
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,712
You want some
steak there, boy?

1490
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:32,413
Huh? Stay.

1491
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:33,915
Stay.

1492
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,083
Stay.

1493
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,119
Psych!

1494
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:40,088
Whoo-hoo!

1495
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:42,690
Yippee ki-yay!

1496
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,096
I thought you said
she could drive!

1497
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:49,864
Oh, I can.
I just thought bear's car

1498
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,466
could use a little
body work.

1499
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,677
All right, guys.
Tonight is the night.

1500
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:04,512
I've given you
all your assignments.

1501
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:05,780
Any questions?

1502
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,116
Hey, so all
the rule breaking stuff,

1503
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:10,985
the fish, fart bell,
everything.

1504
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,553
That was really you?

1505
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:14,989
Yeah.

1506
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:16,758
All right, katchadorian.

1507
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,093
I'm in.

1508
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,928
Did you just
say my name right?

1509
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,864
Hey, rafe.
Who is that guy?

1510
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:24,565
Oh, crap. It's Gus.

1511
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,033
Is it too late to run?

1512
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,903
Turns out
we're not the only ones

1513
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,172
Dwight has pissed off
one too many times.

1514
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:32,907
<i> Kougeki kaishi!</i>

1515
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,043
Are you speaking words
or did you just have a stroke?

1516
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,412
What?

1517
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,480
- Wait, what?
- What?

1518
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:42,450
It's a Japanese war cry.
"Begin the attack!"

1519
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,018
All right, guys, come on!

1520
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,453
<i> Vamonos, muchachos!</i>

1521
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:18,019
Smile!

1522
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,691
Oh, crap.

1523
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,142
Rafe, come on!
It might not be that bad!

1524
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,844
Babe. What's going on?

1525
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:43,911
He won't come out
of his room.

1526
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:46,547
Seriously?
Yeah.

1527
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:47,815
All right. Well, look...

1528
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,250
You go do
whatever you gotta do,

1529
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:50,618
and I'll take care of this.

1530
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,119
Really?
Yeah.

1531
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,888
Good luck.
All right.

1532
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,661
Reveille! Let's go, turd!

1533
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,129
Come on, let's go.
Count of three,

1534
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:03,865
or I'm coming in,
i swear!

1535
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:04,999
One...

1536
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,200
Two...

1537
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,702
Good.
I wanna come in.

1538
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,038
It tingles!
Now it burns!

1539
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,542
You gotta be kidding me!

1540
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,711
What is that made of?

1541
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,081
Oh...

1542
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,516
Unbelievable.

1543
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,118
Ah! He's not even in here!

1544
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,620
Oh, great.
Now I gotta go out

1545
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:26,954
and look for
these little snots?

1546
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,122
That's just what I wanna do.

1547
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,625
No, no. Come on!

1548
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:31,692
Oh.

1549
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,530
What's wrong?

1550
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:37,198
She's missing.
The baby's gone.

1551
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,567
Oh, no. That's what
you're so upset about?

1552
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:40,668
Yes!

1553
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,969
Well, don't worry.

1554
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:42,870
She probably
went to a friend's house.

1555
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,605
I'll give Georgia a call.

1556
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,207
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

1557
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,542
My car!

1558
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:49,710
It's missing! Yes!
Your car?

1559
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:52,213
That's what you're so
worked up about?
Yes!

1560
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:55,683
You know what?
I must have been insane

1561
01:15:55,685 --> 01:15:58,252
not to see
what a self-centered jerk
you really are.

1562
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:00,688
Excuse me, I've got to go
find my kids.

1563
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:18,105
No, no, no!

1564
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,774
Oh, my beautiful bush!

1565
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:22,243
What did they do to you?
Oh, no!

1566
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:25,012
No, god, no! Oh!

1567
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,093
What are all the desks
doing out here?

1568
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,261
I don't know.

1569
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,696
What do we do?

1570
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,865
Pencils up!

1571
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,100
Act like this is
part of the plan.

1572
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,368
Never show weakness, ida.

1573
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,136
There's no sabotaging
the b.L.A.A.R.

1574
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,673
And...

1575
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:53,741
Begin!

1576
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:56,911
"True or false...

1577
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:58,779
"22 hills village students...

1578
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:02,016
"Were suspended
in order to rig this test?"

1579
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,819
Hey, rule number 13,
"no talking during a test."

1580
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:06,654
What's the problem here?

1581
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,823
Well, it's just
these questions
are kind of weird.

1582
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:11,025
Weird?
What do you mean, weird?

1583
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,261
Oh...

1584
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,697
These are pretty weird.

1585
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,332
Hey. Just by a show of hands,

1586
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:20,701
how many people have a test
that starts with the question,

1587
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:21,869
"true or false,

1588
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,372
"principal Dwight
has three nipples"?

1589
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:27,842
Well, that's a lot of you.

1590
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,144
Well, it's false.

1591
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,712
Put false!

1592
01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:34,315
I was born without nipples,
for your information.

1593
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,317
And it looks beautiful.

1594
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,285
Where are the real tests?

1595
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,356
Hey!

1596
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,191
Looking for these?

1597
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,861
Blaarches!

1598
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,968
Principal Dwight
is a hypocrite
who likes to make the rules,

1599
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,804
but thinks he's too good
to actually
follow them himself.

1600
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,173
We have proof

1601
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,741
that he planted evidence
in his own students' lockers.

1602
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,779
I have had
just about enough of you!

1603
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,157
No bike riding on campus.
I'm confiscating this.

1604
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,925
Get off! Get off of it!

1605
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,365
How are you so fast?

1606
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,300
Spin class.
Four nights a week.

1607
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:28,335
Sometimes five.

1608
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,471
What's that's smell?

1609
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:33,274
Just the same crap Dwight's
been shoveling at us.

1610
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:35,209
Ugh! Gross!

1611
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,711
Can't this thing
go any faster?

1612
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,454
Hey, that's my lunch!

1613
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,931
Time to get in the game.

1614
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,338
You're gonna need
a bigger bike.

1615
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:19,353
Ahh!

1616
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:24,492
Ah!

1617
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,027
<i> Tech support.</i>

1618
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,465
Ahh!

1619
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:47,882
Oh, no.

1620
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,121
Thought you could
get away from me, huh?

1621
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:57,958
Oh!

1622
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,130
Oh! That's disgusting!

1623
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,240
What's going on here?
It's all on this tape, ma'am.

1624
01:20:13,242 --> 01:20:14,475
Don't pay
any attention to him.

1625
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:16,177
He's a jerk.

1626
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:17,978
Superintendent, rafe is
a smart and talented kid.

1627
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,280
He deserves to be heard.

1628
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:20,481
He's actually
not that smart.

1629
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,149
He's pretty dumb.

1630
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,417
I've seen his records
from his previous schools.

1631
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:24,885
This kid tests like...

1632
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:26,587
What is this obsession
that we have

1633
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:29,156
with testing
and categorizing our kids?

1634
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,126
I literally have no idea
what you are talking about.

1635
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:35,429
If we keep cramming standard
tests down our kids' throat,

1636
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,932
we're gonna end up with
a bunch of standard children.

1637
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:40,968
I don't know what stinks more,
your attitude or my suit.

1638
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,169
And that's really
saying something,

1639
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,872
because my suit
is covered in poop.

1640
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,874
Nobody cares
what you think anyway.

1641
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,376
I do.
She does.

1642
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:52,246
Mr. teller here has logged
a formal complaint

1643
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:54,048
saying you rigged this test

1644
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,950
and he's been
unlawfully fired.

1645
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,588
Now let's see that tape.

1646
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,257
Yes, ma'am.

1647
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:05,059
And the rules clearly
state that I have the right

1648
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:07,461
to a full hearing.

1649
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:10,397
Rigging state tests
is a serious offense.

1650
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:12,066
You're done here.

1651
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:13,500
I'll make sure you get
your full hearing, Dwight.

1652
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:14,568
Take this.

1653
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,903
In a court of law.

1654
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:17,571
Let's get out of here, ida.

1655
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,207
Thought you'd never ask.

1656
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:29,917
Ah.

1657
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:31,986
Green this time.

1658
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,021
Georgia!

1659
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:35,289
Hey, mom.

1660
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:36,957
I've been looking
all over for you.

1661
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:39,093
What have you been doing?
Mom?

1662
01:21:39,095 --> 01:21:40,327
Come here.

1663
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:42,897
Oh!

1664
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,302
Oh, man.

1665
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:50,170
You little snots are gonna
pay for this!

1666
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:52,239
No, I'll pay. With this.

1667
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,909
And keep the change.

1668
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,144
I hear pier one's having
a sale on animal prints.

1669
01:21:57,146 --> 01:21:59,280
I know you're saying that
just to be hurtful.

1670
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:00,581
But let me
tell you something.

1671
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,283
I get Google alerts
from pier one,

1672
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:03,550
so I already knew
about the sale.

1673
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:05,219
Joke's on you.

1674
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:07,388
You know, it's just sad.

1675
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:10,024
It's sad that
some people, you,

1676
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:13,160
can't handle all this
concentrated awesomeness

1677
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:14,962
me!

1678
01:22:14,964 --> 01:22:16,230
Come on, guys, let's go.

1679
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:17,631
I'm Audi 5g.

1680
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:29,343
Leo!

1681
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:30,711
Dude, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

1682
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:32,947
Are you kidding?

1683
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:35,549
I couldn't miss
the thrilling conclusion
of operation r.A.F.E.

1684
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,985
And...

1685
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:40,321
I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1686
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:42,489
Goodbye? Why are you
saying goodbye?

1687
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,124
Things are just
starting to get good.

1688
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,693
Listen...

1689
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:47,661
I was just hanging around
until you made
some real friends.

1690
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,497
Yeah, because of you.

1691
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:52,299
I wish I could
take that credit,

1692
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,501
but it was all you, rafe.

1693
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,138
I'm gonna miss you.

1694
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,607
I know.

1695
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,654
Awesome!

1696
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,723
You drew me
a vinlothian space cruiser?

1697
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:18,459
You know what?
I guess that's my ride.

1698
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,136
Hey, rafe,

1699
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:30,237
grak-tung!

1700
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,419
Grak-tung!

1701
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:55,529
I've heard you
say that before.

1702
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,432
What does it mean?

1703
01:23:58,434 --> 01:24:02,236
Uh... it means,
"victory is ours."

1704
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:05,072
Well...

1705
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:06,673
Almost.

1706
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:08,342
What?

1707
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:11,211
I don't wanna ruin your sense
of accomplishment,

1708
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,480
but you didn't break
every rule.

1709
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,284
Rule 86.

1710
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,207
Way to go, bro.

1711
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:42,076
Yuck.

1712
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,216
Grak-tung!

1713
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:50,651
Oh!

1714
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,833
B.L.A.A.R.

1715
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:07,634
Hey, come on!
