1
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:10,217
(Ominous Music)

2
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:13,013
(Vince) Everyone
talks about love.

3
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:22,263
But the only examples
I see are hate.

4
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:25,163
Everywhere you look.

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,206
They say to throw your love
out there and make a splash.

6
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,656
(splashing)

7
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,968
Maybe it changes something,
maybe it doesn't.

8
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:44,182
But I believe, eventually,

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,392
that love ripples back.

10
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,878
(Paul) Vince.

11
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:56,746
Vince.

12
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:57,815
Vincent!

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,783
(snapping fingers)

14
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,337
Vincent, hey.

15
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,546
You told Stephen you were
gonna be his groomsmen.

16
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:04,409
(belching)

17
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:05,513
You committed.

18
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,687
You committed.

19
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:07,653
Stephen's groomsman.

20
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,310
You've got yourself like an hour

21
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,898
to get yourself cleaned up.

22
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,141
No, I'm not going.

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,610
Yeah, champagne
is gonna be flowing.

24
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,214
And Vince,

25
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:17,283
You can keep that.

26
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:20,080
Lena Carlyle.

27
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:23,117
She's the maid of honor.

28
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,471
Still not going.

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,336
(crowd murmuring)

30
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,687
Wow.

31
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:42,516
Wow she's hot.

32
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:43,758
She's a fox.

33
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,760
Is that Lena?

34
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:49,695
Is that the line you use
to make girls disappear?

35
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,835
Because I think it's working.

36
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:52,905
So are you happy?

37
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,118
I just wish Mom
and Dad were here.

38
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:01,604
I wish they could see this.

39
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:02,673
Yeah, me too.

40
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:06,471
Well, you look beautiful, smile.

41
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:13,857
(uplifting music)

42
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,809
Steven and Lily.

43
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:13,952
Today you begin your
journey together.

44
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:18,336
Let's think about
that word: together.

45
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:24,134
Together means to
pick up the slack

46
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,103
when your partner is slacking.

47
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:30,210
At times, Lily, you
must be his comfort.

48
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,594
And Stephen, you need
to be her strength.

49
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,011
Becoming soulmates is a process.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,565
Ya know; be open.

51
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,050
(Evangeline) Right now,
I don't have the strength.

52
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,431
I need you.

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,398
So this is what you call love?

54
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:47,627
(Vince) I don't know anymore.

55
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,403
(Evangeline) Well maybe,
you should figure that out.

56
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:57,409
(crackling thunder)

57
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,483
(engine starting)

58
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,661
(screeching tires)

59
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,285
(woman screaming)

60
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,183
(shattering glass)

61
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,048
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

62
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,602
(Bridesmaid)
Come on, kiss her!

63
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:18,534
Woo!

64
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:21,330
(crowd cheering)

65
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,470
Yeah, Stephen.

66
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,852
Mazel Tov! Namaste!

67
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,921
Champagne.

68
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,098
(chuckling)

69
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,341
Hey, Paul.

70
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,628
- What's up, Vince?
- What's up, man?

71
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:34,802
You'll never beat
me to the booze, bro.

72
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,103
No, give it here, give it here.

73
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:37,829
Why else do we come to weddings?

74
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,244
Oh, I don't know, fellas.

75
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,877
Maybe for the vows or
watching people fall in love.

76
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,109
(chuckling)

77
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:42,937
What's up, D'Qwell?

78
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,387
Now I have a question.

79
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:45,630
- Uh
- huh.

80
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,046
Who here is
getting hitched next?

81
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:49,599
Dude, Vince or Manuelo, man.

82
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,982
I am never doing that.

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,262
Marriage is a workshop.

84
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,024
Where men work and women shop.

85
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,716
What I'm saying, DQ,

86
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,960
is that women are like
ice cream from DQ, okay.

87
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,203
They're really good to taste,

88
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,387
but if you hang
unto 'em too long

89
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,655
they melt into a sticky mess.

90
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:11,483
(chuckling)

91
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,140
That's really gross.

92
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,453
A woman's love is
like champagne.

93
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:18,076
It's sweet and the
more it matures

94
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,457
the more nourishing it is.

95
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,493
Oh boy.

96
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:23,150
- Uh
- huh.

97
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,600
Speaking of maturity.

98
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,153
Happy birthday, Vince.

99
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:26,981
Hey!

100
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,569
Let's party, guys.

101
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:29,536
Dirty 30!

102
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:30,778
Dirty 30.

103
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,987
Be careful with these old bones.

104
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:34,713
Maybe in about 15 years or so

105
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,267
I might start thinking
about getting married.

106
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,131
But on one condition.

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,100
It's gotta be that woman.

108
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:43,169
Voila.

109
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,310
Mm mm.

110
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,174
Thou vivacious vixen.

111
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,106
Oh my gosh.

112
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,279
Thou waxeth of Shakespeare.

113
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,074
Thou waxeth of dumb.

114
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,352
(chuckling)

115
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,214
Dumb!

116
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,146
D'Qwell.

117
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:55,389
You're too much of a dog.

118
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,642
Look, she's old enough to drink.

119
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,012
Why is Vince staring at me?

120
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,221
Probably because he
thinks you're a fox.

121
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,568
Or he's just being a creep.

122
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:03,086
That's what I meant, Tara.

123
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,315
The other one's cute, though.

124
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,227
Ugh, don't waste
your time, Tara.

125
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:08,274
They're probably just over
there talking about fishing.

126
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:10,266
There's plenty
of fish in the sea.

127
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,337
Also, she's with Devon.

128
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,614
Ah, that's a good point.

129
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:14,857
That's true.

130
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:16,893
Men, that is all they
do is fish for women.

131
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,550
Catch and release.

132
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,517
Hey, Baby.

133
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,001
Yes, Kadasha?

134
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,278
I didn't say crybaby.

135
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,176
Speaking of baby, what is it?

136
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:25,557
Don't know yet.

137
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,110
No ultra sound.

138
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,388
Probably another boy.

139
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,873
Mm.

140
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,091
Hey, we gotta go pick up Kyson.

141
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:33,945
All right, go wait by the car.

142
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:35,774
I'm gonna see you soon, babe.

143
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:36,948
Okay.

144
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:39,468
Listen, do me a solid favor.

145
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,090
No running around girl to girl.

146
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,542
Be a decent guy.

147
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:48,891
Okay, all right, yup.

148
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,548
Love you, numb nuts.

149
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:51,549
Love you too, man.

150
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:52,929
All right, I've got an idea.

151
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:53,896
Lay it on me.

152
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,312
Let's drink all the champagne.

153
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:57,565
We've already gone
through two bottles.

154
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,867
And then shots to
celebrate Vince's 30th.

155
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,456
Hey, congrats, sir!

156
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:04,769
I'm in no matter
what, dude, seriously.

157
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:05,701
(heart beating)

158
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,081
(Evangeline) No matter.

159
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,740
♪ No matter ♪

160
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:11,983
I still love you, Vince.

161
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,191
No matter.

162
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,058
(somber music)

163
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,549
(guests murmuring)

164
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,727
Vince!

165
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:32,866
Where you going?

166
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:34,867
Lena.

167
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:37,767
Do you want some champagne?

168
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:45,810
Um, I should really
get back to my friends,

169
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,639
but entertaining conversation.

170
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,608
Uh, speaking of entertainment.

171
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:51,677
Um, uh...

172
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,197
Do you like stage plays?

173
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,579
Only if it's Shakespeare.

174
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,616
That's perfect, because
he's like my favorite

175
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,550
and the Gillioz is putting
on Romeo and Juliet

176
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,967
in the next couple of
months and I've got tickets.

177
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:07,970
Cool.

178
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,110
So, what are you
doing Friday night?

179
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,353
Dinner and a movie, with me.

180
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,356
Lena's my girl.

181
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,739
I don't see a ring.

182
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,189
Come on.

183
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:21,466
(shouting)

184
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,709
Easy, easy, easy.

185
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,296
Devon! Devon!

186
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,679
Hey, hey, Devon,
he's drunk, man.

187
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:28,748
Chill out.

188
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,441
You good?

189
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,270
You good?

190
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,339
I'm good.

191
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:37,862
Stay away from my girl.

192
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,623
Babe, let's go.

193
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:46,560
(sighing)

194
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,044
What's wrong with you?

195
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,529
Is, is she gonna be okay?

196
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:51,565
Hey, he wasn't drunk, was he?

197
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:52,497
Is he drunk?

198
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,947
Will you go check on her?

199
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,016
You okay?

200
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:57,846
Hey.

201
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,849
Vince.

202
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:00,712
Hey!

203
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,781
Vince!

204
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,933
(beeping)

205
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,696
(squeaking brakes)

206
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,328
Hey, Vincent.

207
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,710
Valentina?

208
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,779
Hey.

209
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,820
I haven't seen you since, uh.

210
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:40,890
Our last date.

211
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,479
Where you broke up with me.

212
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,862
I go away for two years and.

213
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,451
I mean, come on, Vince.

214
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,627
I called you probably 100 times.

215
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:55,146
And I left you messages.

216
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:56,837
I never forgot about you.

217
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,809
I'm really sad you
left, actually.

218
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:06,743
Where'd you go?

219
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:12,749
Away.

220
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,100
I think I'm in love with you.

221
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,623
Is this what you
call love, Vince?

222
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,452
(Evangeline) So this
is what you call love?

223
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,910
I'll show you what love is.

224
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:38,947
Okay.

225
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,433
That's fast.

226
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:46,955
Then, can we talk?

227
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,622
Really?

228
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,588
Why would I wanna talk?

229
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,280
So that's all I am to you?

230
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:03,386
Just a body.

231
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,215
No, babe.

232
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,526
An object?

233
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:07,011
You're more than that, you're...

234
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,816
I can't believe that's
what you were thinking about

235
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,635
the entire time we
were dating, wasn't it?

236
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,292
Please, don't pout to me, okay.

237
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,534
Pouting, maybe that's why

238
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,467
I didn't return your
calls, you know?

239
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:19,609
I guess the only real
pleasure I got from you

240
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,957
was our kiss and
you refused to go

241
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,555
to the next level then,
the same as you are now.

242
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,787
The next level?

243
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,893
You're the one that
cheated on me, remember?

244
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,593
So why did you even
come here tonight?

245
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,840
(light music)

246
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:55,611
Happy birthday, Vince.

247
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,202
(light music)

248
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,328
Come on, don't look
at me like that, sis.

249
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,712
(light music)

250
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,406
(dialing)

251
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,861
(buzzing phone)

252
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,105
It can wait.

253
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,247
Don't answer it.

254
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,009
What's up, Vince?

255
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,495
Hey, Stephen, Lily.

256
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,085
Look, I didn't mean to make
a scene at your wedding.

257
00:12:56,154 --> 00:13:01,056
But the fact is I
did and I'm sorry.

258
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,472
You deserved a perfect
day and I messed that up.

259
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,372
Anyway, I think you're
a wonderful couple

260
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,685
and I wish you the best.

261
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,170
And a hearty congratulations.

262
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, thank you, Vince.

263
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:17,381
It means a lot.

264
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,109
Hey, and stay away from my sis...

265
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,396
I would tell you,
happy birthday, but it's come and gone.

266
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,849
I waited six hours, Vincent
because you promised

267
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,127
you would be here at 8:00
and we would celebrate

268
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:40,198
by going through
your photo albums.

269
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,067
Yeah, well the wedding
went a little long, so.

270
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:44,375
And that makes it okay
to not keep your word?

271
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:46,422
And how am I supposed to feel
when you're out late at night

272
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:49,138
when the cartel is
causing havoc in the city?

273
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:50,726
Save your drama for
your llama, momma.

274
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,693
Have you ever talked to a llama?

275
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:56,111
Hey Mr. Llama, my son
won't keep his word.

276
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,975
What should I do?

277
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,700
(cud chewing)

278
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:00,805
Really?

279
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:01,771
That's funny.

280
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,291
Llama, your breath stinks.

281
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,362
(cud chewing)

282
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:10,297
No matter what good advice
you get, there's Vince.

283
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,575
(cud chewing)

284
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,347
Hey Mom.

285
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,108
Don't give your drama
to your momma, Llama.

286
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,454
I should have been here.

287
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,148
I should have been there.

288
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,289
I just want peace, you know.

289
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:45,918
Hey.

290
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,267
Hey.

291
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:55,066
I know you miss her.

292
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:57,172
We all do.

293
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:00,900
Just remember the importance
of a promise, okay?

294
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,490
Okay.

295
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:13,913
Goodnight, Momma.

296
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:17,744
God bless you, Llama.

297
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:22,162
(light music)

298
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,270
(revving engine)

299
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,346
(buzzing saw)

300
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,764
(Paul) Manuelo, more two
by fours, man, I'm not...

301
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,766
- (Ben) Woo
- hoo! Donuts!

302
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:15,836
Donuts!

303
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,528
(Together) Go nuts for donuts!

304
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:18,805
Go nuts for donuts!

305
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,945
(Vince) Come on in
and get some, boys.

306
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,441
Dude, I love it
when you're late.

307
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,122
Best job site rule ever.

308
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,191
Vincent!

309
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,608
Oo!

310
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,060
Watch this.

311
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,406
(chuckling)

312
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,305
Hey, what's up, Roxanne?

313
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:38,238
You foxy lady, you
want some donuts, hm?

314
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:39,619
They're fresh.

315
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,347
15 late days this month.

316
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,903
And why was today so special?

317
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,389
I have more important
things to do

318
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:56,015
than worry about if
nincompoops like you

319
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,465
are gonna show up on time!

320
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,434
You are...

321
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:04,608
fired.

322
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,371
You can have the box.

323
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:13,066
Help D'Qwell in the
master with the walls.

324
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,309
Roger that, babe.

325
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,414
I'm not your babe.

326
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:17,967
Thank you, Manny.

327
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,566
(Roxanne) And you're not
a charming prince, Vince.

328
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,247
Ha, whatever you say, Foxy Roxy.

329
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:23,213
All right.

330
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,287
Yo, yo, yo, what's up, D'Qwell?

331
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:29,669
You ready to get stuff done?

332
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,362
(nail gun firing)

333
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:39,781
Okay.

334
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,579
Laurel's dog take a
dookie in your oatmeal?

335
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:44,684
You know what?

336
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:46,479
We're gonna talk about this.

337
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,171
You go on dates, kiss the girls,

338
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,666
you have your little
one night stands,

339
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,072
but you ain't loved a single
one of them, have you?

340
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,660
Come on, man.

341
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,086
You know as well
as I do, the chics,

342
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,629
they like being
snuggled, you know.

343
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:01,080
That's not why you do
it, you self-centered ho.

344
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,462
Why'd you have to make
a move on Lena, man?

345
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:05,670
You know why you did it?

346
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:07,534
Because you lust
and you call it love

347
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:09,260
and you see her, she's
young, she's pretty

348
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,686
and you just wanna
use her young body

349
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,091
for your pleasure, is that it?

350
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,059
Right, that mindset
is what turns good men

351
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,025
into rapists and molesters.

352
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,544
Is that what you want, Vince?

353
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:20,408
No.

354
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,205
I didn't think that's
what I was doing.

355
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:24,758
Yeah, well, you don't think.

356
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,968
Before you claim
to love someone,

357
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,694
you need to find
out what love is.

358
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:32,662
Grow up.

359
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,735
(solemn music)

360
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,082
Vince.

361
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,049
What's up, Ben?

362
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,412
Have you seen the
movie "Twilight?"

363
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:45,468
Nope.

364
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:48,241
All right, so there's
this vampire guy, right?

365
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:52,407
This skinny vampire guy
who's totally into this chic.

366
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,650
She's all like,
oo, I'm not sure.

367
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,204
And the vampire guy
is like, I'm sure.

368
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:57,412
She's like, okay.

369
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,492
And so then they start
making out, right?

370
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,379
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

371
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:00,898
And then werewolf guy shows up

372
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,383
and he's all like, bro, I'm
totally gonna steal your girl.

373
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:06,006
Okay, Ben, Ben, just
save the backstory.

374
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:07,698
Give me the punchline.

375
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,078
Take martial arts with me.

376
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:12,151
There are private
lessons, right?

377
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,084
I mean they're
technically not legal.

378
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,614
I mean, she's got some
unorthodox methods.

379
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:17,639
Whoa, whoa, she?

380
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,467
Not legal?

381
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,641
Yeah man, sign me up.

382
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,608
Dude, Devon is
gonna come after you.

383
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,610
Dude, Ben, Devon has
nothing to worry about.

384
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,785
Is this the same Devon
that we're talking about?

385
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,787
Whenever a guy's tried
to steal his girlfriend,

386
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,720
he turns into, Hulk smash!

387
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,275
He's not gonna let
you forget about this.

388
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:36,761
And Alicia can turn
skinny vampire Vince

389
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,144
into a slippery, lethal weapon.

390
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:44,252
You would actually stand a
chance against werewolf dude.

391
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:52,432
(woman whispering)

392
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,746
What?

393
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,057
I didn't say anything.

394
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:59,853
(woman's breath)

395
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,409
Okay Ben, look.

396
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:07,516
I'm never going to take
martial arts from a woman.

397
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,864
So, why are you here, handsome?

398
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:17,802
You know, I'm just here to
learn how to take down Goliath

399
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:22,876
and win your heart,
thou fair Juliet.

400
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:24,015
(chortle)

401
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,224
Shut up.

402
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:28,227
This class is not for
faint hearted Romeo.

403
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,366
Or is it David?

404
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,850
I'm confused.

405
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,508
This class requires more
than just your pretty face.

406
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,924
It requires commitment.

407
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:39,617
Well, he is committed, Alicia.

408
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:40,825
Yeah.

409
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,206
He's got something to fight for.

410
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,034
- (chuckles)
- Yeah?

411
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,103
I do, so quit it.

412
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,556
No, you are selfish.

413
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,178
But, you pay me good money.

414
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,767
And you're gorgeous.

415
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:55,564
So... let's begin.

416
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,679
- Whoa, whoa, Alice.
- Alicia.

417
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,842
Whatever, kind of hot chic.

418
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,361
Look, I don't wanna hit girls.

419
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,018
You already hit on me.

420
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:02,502
What, no? I was just.

421
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:03,986
Ha, you did, kinda.

422
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,194
Okay, sorta.

423
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,059
Look, point is, I
don't want to hurt you.

424
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,408
(smacking)

425
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:12,236
Ah!

426
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,202
(ears ringing)

427
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,032
You think he needs CPR?

428
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:17,068
Because I could totally
use the practice.

429
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,692
Hey, buddy.

430
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:24,144
You're taking this vampire
look way too seriously.

431
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,213
What?

432
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:28,217
You say you want
to fight off Goliath.

433
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,462
David's downfall was Bath-sheba.

434
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,120
Ha,

435
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,328
Owwww.

436
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,256
(Voicemail) To listen
to your message press,

437
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,436
first message.

438
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:40,954
(D'Qwell) Hey
Vince, it's D'Qwell.

439
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:43,198
Sorry I was a little
rough on you yesterday.

440
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,486
You know, I'm serious
about what I said, man.

441
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,166
I love ya, I'm just
looking out for you.

442
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:48,548
And if you're ready
to learn what love is,

443
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,447
come meet me at the church.

444
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:51,758
All right, brother.

445
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:52,839
Hope to hear from you soon.

446
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,382
Hey, hey, brother, brother.

447
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:57,695
Hey, can you spare me
a couple bucks here?

448
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:59,318
Sorry, man, I gotta go.

449
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,600
(Hardy) Why marriage, hm?

450
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:06,842
Why start a family?

451
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,468
We all know divorces
are increasing, right?

452
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:14,022
Divorce rates have
actually gone down

453
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,921
because fewer and fewer couples

454
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,440
are actually getting married.

455
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,718
So many people are convinced

456
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:23,342
that marriage will
eventually end in divorce,

457
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:27,484
they won't vow in
marriage at all.

458
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:28,864
I mean and with...

459
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,141
Devon?

460
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,074
(Hardy) All the good
advice on social media.

461
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,490
- Bath
- sheba.

462
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,279
(Hardy) And the internet,
can you blame 'em?

463
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,666
I mean, if we spent as much time

464
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:41,532
investing in loving someone
rather than seeking to be loved,

465
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,364
man, our relationships
would thrive.

466
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,538
How many of you have
divorced parents?

467
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,163
See: people fall in love
and they get married

468
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:56,029
but 10 years and two
kids down the road,

469
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:57,928
they somehow fall out of love?

470
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,827
Real love is not
blind; it's all seeing.

471
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,521
It sees all of the faults.

472
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,834
It sees your bad habits;
the imperfections.

473
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:08,973
It loves anyway.

474
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:14,669
Infatuation... is
blind... and fragile.

475
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,023
When things aren't going
perfect, it disappears.

476
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,613
Or when tragedy strikes.

477
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:28,821
(car zooming)

478
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,960
(woman screaming)

479
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:30,788
(Hardy) It vanishes.

480
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:31,857
(heart beating)

481
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,585
(ominous music)

482
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:35,897
Well, she'd still be alive

483
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:38,347
if hadn't given her
everything she wanted!

484
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,659
She was just a kid!

485
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,489
You forced her
into the grave, Leon,

486
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:43,974
because you forced her
to do everything else!

487
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:45,700
I am done with you!

488
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:46,908
Get out!

489
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,323
Ha!

490
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:51,568
Well it amazes me how
easy it is to walk away.

491
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:55,744
I thought I loved you once.

492
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,159
Perhaps I never did.

493
00:23:57,988 --> 00:23:58,988
Get out!

494
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,685
(ominous music)

495
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:11,829
Most of the time, when
tragedy strikes a family...

496
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:15,108
a divorce follows.

497
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,180
Those life changing events,

498
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,601
they can serve... to
either destroy

499
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,327
a marriage or strengthen one.

500
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:29,915
Vince, Vince.

501
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,367
Vince, come on, man.

502
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,096
It's Evangeline, isn't it?

503
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,168
She was my everything.

504
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:42,273
(sniffs)

505
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:43,482
My rock, my conscience.

506
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:46,346
And now she's gone.

507
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,348
So you just thought
baby faced Lena

508
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,178
could some how mask your pain?

509
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:51,041
I guess.

510
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,387
You know her dad died?

511
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:55,563
Sister just got married.

512
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:57,979
Just imagine how she
feels living alone

513
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:00,015
in that apartment just
trying to make end's meet.

514
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,500
Baby, baby.

515
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,236
Look, I can't have
what you guys have, okay?

516
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,710
This perfect little family.

517
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:05,642
Why not?

518
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,333
Because I can't protect them.

519
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:08,783
I couldn't protect Evangeline.

520
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,924
Stop it, Evangeline loves you.

521
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:14,858
She is looking down on heaven
trying to help you, brother.

522
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:17,377
This thing with Lena,
I need you to just

523
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:19,863
view her like a sister, okay?

524
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,969
Build a... a foundation
of friendship.

525
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:24,315
Wait, what?

526
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,178
What about Devon?

527
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,248
What?

528
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,009
He sees you two hanging out,

529
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:30,218
he is not gonna
call it friendship.

530
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:32,771
Ugh.

531
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,535
Listen to me, okay.

532
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:42,541
Every society fails when their
protectors become predators.

533
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:45,854
You don't need to
try to find someone,

534
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:47,753
you need to try to be someone.

535
00:25:47,822 --> 00:25:49,444
Be a protector, brother.

536
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,515
And then they'll find you.

537
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:55,105
Be a brother before a lover,
not the other way around.

538
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:55,968
All right?

539
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,176
All right, man.

540
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:58,245
All right.

541
00:25:58,936 --> 00:25:59,834
Hey.

542
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:01,111
Be good, love ya, brother.

543
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,837
Love you too, man.

544
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,634
(light music)

545
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,579
(Lena) You know, it's
company policy not

546
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:13,364
to give customers this
kind of attention.

547
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,470
Well then that's why
I'm not one, today.

548
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:19,301
Thank you, this is so sweet.

549
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,581
But um, I really need
to keep this job.

550
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:25,756
Okay, I guess I'll
see you Friday night.

551
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:30,381
(rushing traffic)

552
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:34,109
(horn honking)

553
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:43,912
(restaurant chatter)
(background music)

554
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:56,925
Are you stalking me?

555
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:02,172
Stocking? Are you
prepping for Christmas?

556
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,553
Company policy says I
have to be nice to customers

557
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,764
but I think management might
agree, you're an exception.

558
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,214
Um, in that case
I think I'll have...

559
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:11,871
What are you
doing here, Vincent?

560
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,079
I'm hungry.

561
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,494
For food or punishment?

562
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:15,426
Forgiveness.

563
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:16,669
We don't serve that here.

564
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:18,844
Well, I guess I'll
just have your...

565
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:20,052
you know what, surprise me.

566
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:22,744
Coming right up.

567
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:23,813
Thank you.

568
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,581
Careful, the plate is
hot with displeasure.

569
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,135
Wow, what a surprise.

570
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:35,481
It's what you ordered!

571
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,482
Hey Lena, wait.

572
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:37,551
Look.

573
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:41,383
I am so sorry about
the other night.

574
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:44,224
It may have been the
drinking, I don't know.

575
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,009
What I do know is
that you're a hustler.

576
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,331
You've got these two
jobs you're working

577
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:48,977
with classes in between.

578
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:51,946
And with Lily getting
married and moving away,

579
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:54,051
I know it's gotta
be hard to pay rent.

580
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,847
I just wanna help ya out with
things in life, you know.

581
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,100
What do you know about my life?

582
00:27:58,124 --> 00:27:59,850
I know what it's
like to lose somebody.

583
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,750
I'd like to be there
for ya, you know?

584
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:05,684
Kind of like a
brother you never had.

585
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,168
A brother.

586
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,379
Yeah, okay, uh.

587
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:13,553
Goodnight.

588
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:14,934
Uh, I'll serve you now.

589
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,626
You just did.

590
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,329
He seems like a keeper.

591
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:33,608
What a dead beat,
what are you thinking?

592
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:38,130
Maybe forgiveness
is on the menu.

593
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:42,721
♪ Yeah, You're Missin' Out ♪

594
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,790
(brakes screeching)

595
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,033
Prosecutor.

596
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,795
Detective.

597
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:48,864
You're late.

598
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,040
Working on the cartel case.

599
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:54,905
It's getting worse.

600
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:56,389
Two more homicides last week.

601
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:01,049
Catch them and I'll
see they get life.

602
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:06,641
The issue I'm having
is they're well armed,

603
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,231
well organized, and
they're getting recruits.

604
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,750
You have an entire police force

605
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,234
at your disposal, Mr. Clark.

606
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:14,442
What's taking you?

607
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:17,100
Bringing me one
name is not enough.

608
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:20,103
Everyone I've interrogated
refuses to give up the leader.

609
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,070
I don't want pawns, Mrs. Draper,

610
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:23,175
I want the king.

611
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:25,463
And no one will
go up against him

612
00:29:25,487 --> 00:29:26,834
for fear of getting killed.

613
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,492
That includes you.

614
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:07,633
(soft music)

615
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:12,189
So, how does this work?

616
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:14,467
(Olivia) You first.

617
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:15,536
- I'm going first?
- Yup.

618
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:18,023
Don't threaten me
with a good time.

619
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,092
(chuckles)

620
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,234
Is it from me?

621
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,237
Oo.

622
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:29,413
Well, since you're mommy's
pampered little girl.

623
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:30,380
(Evangeline) Oh right?

624
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,933
(chuckling)

625
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:34,315
And since you never got
over your princess phase,

626
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:36,282
I actually thought
you might like this.

627
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:40,528
Maybe you could use it
for balls or dances.

628
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,875
Maybe Scott asks you
to Ho-Co or prom.

629
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,912
I hope he never does.

630
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:46,016
Ha, oh.
(chuckles)

631
00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:49,261
Oh my. Vince, I love it.

632
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,162
Let me get this outta your way.

633
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:55,577
It's beautiful.

634
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,475
Just like you.

635
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:58,097
Thank you.

636
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,236
(Parents) Aww.

637
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,305
You're welcome.

638
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,238
Love you.

639
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,515
- Love you too.
- Thanks.

640
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,345
Oh, and there actually
is a dance coming up.

641
00:31:04,414 --> 00:31:05,622
What?

642
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:08,038
And I will wear
this on one condition.

643
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:09,315
Oh?

644
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:12,077
That you come as
my dance partner.

645
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:13,941
(chuckling)

646
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,873
(clears throat)

647
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:17,737
As thou hast wished, my lady.

648
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:19,291
Thank you.

649
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,602
No peeking.

650
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,671
Okay.

651
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:28,852
And...

652
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,785
Whoa! What?

653
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,718
No way, there's no way
you can afford that.

654
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:33,719
- You guys did this, huh?
- No!

655
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:34,823
You guys did this.

656
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,102
No, no, it was all her.

657
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,932
I knew you wanted to
learn so I saved up.

658
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,201
Oh my gosh, you're such a
sweetheart, thank you so much.

659
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:43,418
I'm speechless.

660
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,662
Okay, I'll learn it
on one condition.

661
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:46,490
(laughing)

662
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,353
Here we go.

663
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,422
And what is that?

664
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,770
You help me write a song.

665
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:55,534
Okay, as thou hast
wished, M'sieur Weirdo.

666
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:56,638
(parents chuckling)

667
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:00,263
One about us?

668
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,195
Deal.

669
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:02,058
Okay.

670
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:05,647
(slapping)

671
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:06,716
Boom.

672
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:11,653
♪ No matter where you go ♪

673
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,553
(uplifting music)

674
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,846
How would you define love?

675
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:36,575
Love isn't something
you control, Vince.

676
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,853
For me and Lily,
it just happened.

677
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,482
Still feel that way
after the honeymoon?

678
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:46,516
It means to plant
trees under whose shade

679
00:32:46,585 --> 00:32:48,725
you don't expect to sit.

680
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:54,317
Love is taking care of the poor!

681
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:56,043
Why the sudden interest in love?

682
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:59,287
Got a girl on your mind?

683
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:00,564
Eh, maybe.

684
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:02,290
Mostly I'm just curious
as to why people

685
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,052
would have pets
for their family.

686
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,329
I don't get that.

687
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,847
Why not just have
spouse and kids?

688
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,195
Why do you have to have
a whiny little pup?

689
00:33:10,264 --> 00:33:11,920
(mimics dog whimpering)

690
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,577
Well, why not?

691
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:14,854
I mean pets are cute

692
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:16,563
and they don't talk
back to their parents.

693
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:19,756
Oh, except for my pet llama.

694
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,209
(cud chewing)

695
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:26,521
(chuckling)

696
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,590
Look at this.

697
00:33:28,937 --> 00:33:30,042
Love, the total commitment

698
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:32,562
to the spiritual growth
of another person.

699
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:36,704
(uplifting music)

700
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,785
- Here you go.
- Hey, Lil.

701
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:51,270
D'Qwell, man, DQ
dude, I don't know

702
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:53,134
what trap you got me in.

703
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:56,241
I've been studying and
studying and studying

704
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,658
and I cannot find an answer
to the love question.

705
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,660
All I find is more questions.

706
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,317
I've always had
feelings for people

707
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:06,872
but I've been asking
myself, is love a feeling?

708
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:08,943
And when you lose that feeling,

709
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,463
how do you love
when you don't love?

710
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:18,884
Love is a verb.

711
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:22,163
Love the feeling is a
fruit of love, the verb.

712
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,132
(chuckling)

713
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:26,201
Wait!

714
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:28,618
That's kind of interesting.

715
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:35,452
(Vince) So love her. Serve her.

716
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:40,492
Sacrifice. Listen to her;
empathize; appreciate.

717
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,564
Affirm her.

718
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:44,633
(ominous music)

719
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,362
Vince, you coming
to my birthday party?

720
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:50,536
Well heaven's yeah, babe.

721
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,814
What do you want
for it, big Kyson?

722
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,058
A football and
to blast fireworks.

723
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,173
- Oo, that sounds fun.
- Wait, what?

724
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:58,234
Hey man, I'll blast some for ya.

725
00:34:58,303 --> 00:34:59,166
You'll be here, huh?

726
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:01,133
Like the last two years.

727
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:02,522
Don't you disappoint
my son again.

728
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:03,618
I'll be here.

729
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,586
Scout's honor, man.

730
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:06,552
- Mm
- hm.

731
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,381
- Mm
- hm.

732
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,968
- Mm
- hm.

733
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:11,557
Oh yeah, Mommy might
give me a baby sister.

734
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:15,906
Hey come here, come here.

735
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,188
Can you do me a favor, buddy?

736
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,430
Heaven's yeah, babe.

737
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:23,752
Your sister, she's
going to be like

738
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,365
the most important
person in your life.

739
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:29,023
Always treat her like
a princess, okay?

740
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:29,955
Can you do that for me?

741
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,370
Scout's honor.

742
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,475
That's my boy.

743
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,649
So baby, when's dinner ready?

744
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,445
It's in the microwave.

745
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:39,516
Pot roast? Microwave?

746
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,484
That pregnancy got
you acting crazy.

747
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,486
Don't be criticizing
your wife's choices.

748
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,108
You're one of 'em.

749
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,247
(chuckling)

750
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,535
- Oh, ho, ho!
- (Vince) Roasted.

751
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,113
Okay, well what is a
queen without her king?

752
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,770
Historically?

753
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,427
More powerful.

754
00:35:53,496 --> 00:35:57,224
(laughing)

755
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:58,052
(smacking)

756
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:58,880
Oof!

757
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,848
(laughing)

758
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:01,987
You went low!

759
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:02,988
- You went.
- I went to the gut.

760
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:03,989
- You know what?
- I went to gut.

761
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:04,990
- It's go time!
- I went to gut.

762
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,233
It's go time!
(loud laughter)

763
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:07,855
So I wanted to ask you guys,

764
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,375
what's the greatest
love story of all time?

765
00:36:10,444 --> 00:36:11,721
Easy.

766
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,963
Romeo and Juliet.

767
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:14,689
Wow, really Ben?

768
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,795
Even Shakespeare said
that was a tragedy.

769
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:18,072
Okay.
(Manuelo chuckles)

770
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,316
They were so in love
they couldn't carry on

771
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:21,465
in life without each other.

772
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:22,663
Exactly.

773
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:24,354
You mean to tell
me it would be love

774
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:26,463
that prompts you to kill
yourself if your wife died?

775
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:29,290
No, having one would.

776
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,121
Love goes beyond a husband
and wife relationship.

777
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,295
Agreed.

778
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:35,848
When Kyson was
born, I felt a love

779
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,895
greater than I've ever felt
in my entire life, okay.

780
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,957
That's a love that Romeo and
Juliet denied themselves.

781
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:43,131
Mm, I felt the same way
when my daughter was born.

782
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,376
(hissing compressor stopping)

783
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:47,688
You?

784
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:48,757
You have a daughter?

785
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,587
You have a brain?

786
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:51,830
Is she hot?

787
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,521
No, you can't date my daughter.

788
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,764
What? Come on!

789
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,180
I take it you spent
a lot of time trying

790
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,319
to find your daughter?

791
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,287
How long has it been?

792
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:01,909
Years.

793
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:02,978
(soft piano music)

794
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:04,704
Look, Vince.

795
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:07,432
We've all lost
somebody at some point.

796
00:37:08,674 --> 00:37:11,194
Whether through death or...

797
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,438
someone moves far away.

798
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:20,997
But when two people
truly love each other,

799
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,967
they always find
a way to connect.

800
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:29,453
No matter what.

801
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:33,009
(piano & strings music)

802
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,291
Did you hear on
the news that there's

803
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,224
a drug cartel around here?

804
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,263
(Kadasha) Who's ready
for some chocolate cake?

805
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:48,024
Oo, I love chocolate cake.

806
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:49,715
You don't love chocolate cake.

807
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,993
And you know what I love?

808
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,754
I'm just saying, I mean what

809
00:37:53,823 --> 00:37:55,041
have you ever done
for chocolate cake?

810
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,481
Do you call up chocolate cake?

811
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,553
Do you wanna help chocolate
cake reach its goals?

812
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:01,934
Surprise chocolate cake at work?

813
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:04,523
Do you wanna marry chocolate
cake and make nice little

814
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:07,388
swirly, vanilla
chocolate baby cupcakes?

815
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:08,320
D'Qwell!

816
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,184
Do not give me a sermon on love.

817
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:11,875
I'm just saying,
there's a difference

818
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:13,118
between loving chocolate cake

819
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:14,302
and just desiring
chocolate cake.

820
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,535
I think love is like a ghost.

821
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:21,920
Because like, everybody
talks about it,

822
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:23,784
but do we ever see one?

823
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,821
Just saying.

824
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:31,343
(light music)

825
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:40,318
Nice.

826
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:41,733
Keep your guard up.

827
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,148
Hyah!
(groans)

828
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,494
(grunting)

829
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,293
(Ben) Oh, that's
a death sentence.

830
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,331
That's six feet under, dude.

831
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,058
(grunting)

832
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,164
Ugh!

833
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,614
Oof!

834
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:02,236
(cracking)

835
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,064
Ah!

836
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,133
Oh, oh.

837
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:06,551
Ah!

838
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,345
I hear you've
been breaking hearts

839
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:08,553
and chasing young girls.

840
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,934
Which means either
you don't care

841
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:12,798
or you know nothing about love.

842
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:17,941
If it's real it costs; it hurts.

843
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,012
I broke the closest
thing to your heart.

844
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:23,637
And every time you
hurt another girl,

845
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,433
I'll break something
else of yours.

846
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,194
I understand if
you no longer wish

847
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:31,196
to continue our
working relationship.

848
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,787
Do you want to continue
on this journey with me?

849
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:40,378
(light music)

850
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:43,415
Heaven's yeah, babe.

851
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:46,694
I love it when you call me that.

852
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:50,629
Ah, ah, ow!

853
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:53,080
(whimpering)

854
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:57,912
Ow.

855
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:00,605
(chuckling)

856
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:01,675
Okay.

857
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:02,676
I need my dad.

858
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,022
Well done.

859
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,886
You were right, Ben.

860
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,163
He is committed.

861
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:08,336
- Mm
- hm.

862
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,648
Is he single?

863
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:14,239
So, do I only get visits
when you break a bone, son?

864
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:16,414
I brought you a gift.

865
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:18,864
That shouldn't be in here.

866
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:21,935
How's your mother?

867
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,320
Oh, the bank wants
to take her house.

868
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:27,873
Really?

869
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:29,288
She didn't say anything to me.

870
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:33,396
But then again, she
hasn't for years.

871
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,465
So.

872
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:36,813
How'd ya break it?

873
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:38,539
Oh, learning about love.

874
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,059
(chuckling)

875
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,544
Anything stick this time?

876
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:44,763
Oh, that it's extremely painful.

877
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:46,582
It makes your heart race.

878
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:47,651
- Mm
- hm.

879
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,070
Well, judging by
your heart rate,

880
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:53,968
what's broken is
behind your ribs.

881
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,109
Lift your shirt, please.

882
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:03,115
(groaning)

883
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:08,155
Maybe you're looking for
love in the wrong place.

884
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:09,777
Where else could I look?

885
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,230
Oh, come on, Dad.

886
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,025
What? I didn't say anything.

887
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,348
Look, why can't I just come over

888
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:19,546
and we have a beer and talk?

889
00:41:19,615 --> 00:41:21,444
I really do
appreciate the offer.

890
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,170
I know that you blame
it for the divorce

891
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,182
but there's nothing wrong
with having a beer or two.

892
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,206
And there's nothing wrong

893
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:27,522
with letting him
into your heart.

894
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:30,418
You know what,
I don't need this.

895
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,110
I made a mistake coming here.

896
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:34,456
What's her name?

897
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,498
(clinking glasses)

898
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,328
As I have opened this
beer at your suggestion,

899
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:45,744
I hope you will open your
heart to Him at mine.

900
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:56,375
Glad I'm a private doctor.

901
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:06,524
I just want peace, you know.

902
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:09,606
I guess the only thing I've
really learned about love so far

903
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,598
is it's extremely painful.

904
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,601
Pain. The one thing
we spend our whole life

905
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,605
trying to avoid, while
expecting to grow.

906
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:20,572
You walked out on Mom, Dad.

907
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,781
You don't really have
a lot of room to talk.

908
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:28,822
I've made some of the
biggest mistakes, yes.

909
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,791
But I've also learned some
of the biggest lessons, son.

910
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,588
But you messed up, so you hurt.

911
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:37,865
Why does it hurt me

912
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:38,946
to actually attempt
to love somebody?

913
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,075
True love never hurts anyone.

914
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:42,629
Longing hurts.

915
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:45,045
Selfishness, jealousy...

916
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:46,184
They cause pain.

917
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:51,741
And Love... Love
gets blamed for it.

918
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,917
Selfishness says, "what
can you do for me?"

919
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:59,577
But Love asks, "what
can I do for you?"

920
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:02,372
It's like casting love
out and making a splash.

921
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:07,446
Slowly... Love
ripples back to you.

922
00:43:07,515 --> 00:43:08,758
(belching)

923
00:43:08,827 --> 00:43:10,035
Pretty good speech.

924
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:11,347
Ha.

925
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:12,244
You couldn't be more religious.

926
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:13,521
More scientific, then?

927
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:16,903
Sure.

928
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,459
Take your science.

929
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,392
Prove me wrong.

930
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:31,056
But son, studying about love
will only take you so far.

931
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:33,231
(belching)

932
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,473
Excuse me.

933
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:37,042
And don't forget
your prescription.

934
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:39,995
Drugs?

935
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:45,692
"Love all, trust a few,

936
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:49,523
do wrong to none."

937
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:50,593
Shakespeare.

938
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,319
Your hero, Shakespeare.

939
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:55,149
And if it doesn't work?

940
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,394
Increase the dose.

941
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:03,468
(sighing)

942
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:07,921
(protestors shouting)

943
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,716
Another murder in the city.

944
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:11,752
The body was discovered
earlier today

945
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:13,478
in the downtown area.

946
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:16,377
Detective Alfred Clark
says, preliminary evidence

947
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:19,070
points to the cartel
in this latest killing.

948
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,278
According to authorities,

949
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:22,521
hate crimes have
risen dramatically.

950
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,316
Up 12% this year.

951
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:26,111
The more chaotic people get,

952
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,218
the bigger government has to
be to maintain law and order...

953
00:44:29,287 --> 00:44:31,220
The American people
are only a threat

954
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:33,394
to the idea of big government.

955
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:34,741
It's called checks and balances

956
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,432
and clearly you've
never heard of that.

957
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:39,262
As a politician my only
interest is the American people.

958
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:41,195
I represent the
American people...

959
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,483
Then why don't
you listen to them?

960
00:44:42,507 --> 00:44:43,819
Why do you keep interrupting me?

961
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:47,685
(sighing)

962
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,687
Love never lasts.

963
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:56,866
(mysterious music)

964
00:44:58,005 --> 00:44:59,005
Mom?

965
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:08,153
(Einstein) To my
daughter, Lieserl Einstein.

966
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,364
When I proposed the
theory of relativity,

967
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:16,127
very few understood me
and what I reveal now

968
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:19,958
to transmit to mankind
will also collide

969
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:23,651
with the misunderstanding
and prejudice in the world.

970
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:27,725
There is an extremely
powerful force,

971
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:32,730
that, so far science has not
found a formal explanation to.

972
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:38,563
It is a force that
includes and...

973
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,392
governs all,

974
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:44,362
and is even behind
any phenomenon

975
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:46,985
operating in the universe.

976
00:45:47,054 --> 00:45:49,988
And has not yet
been defined by us.

977
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:54,821
This universal force... is Love.

978
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,307
Love is light, that
enlightens those

979
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,034
who give and receive it.

980
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:04,140
Love is gravity, because
it makes some people

981
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:06,211
feel attracted to others.

982
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,387
Love is power,
because it multiplies

983
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:12,942
the best we have and
allows humanity not

984
00:46:13,011 --> 00:46:15,565
to be extinguished
in selfishness.

985
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:18,016
Love unfolds and reveals.

986
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:21,468
For love we live and die.

987
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:25,783
God is Love and Love is God.

988
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:30,063
Love is the most
powerful force there is

989
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:32,306
because it has no limits.

990
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:35,516
Each individual
carries within them

991
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,830
a small, but powerful
generator of love

992
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:42,040
whose energy is
waiting to be released.

993
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:43,949
Do you have an apartment
I can rent until Spring?

994
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:44,974
Who do I write it to?

995
00:46:45,043 --> 00:46:47,045
Grant Enterprises.

996
00:46:47,114 --> 00:46:48,806
(Einstein) My dear Lieserl.

997
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:53,362
Maybe it's too
late to apologize.

998
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:57,745
But as time is relative,
I need to tell you,

999
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:00,748
"I love you.

1000
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,339
And thanks to you I have
reached the ultimate answer."

1001
00:47:07,272 --> 00:47:08,929
Mr. Abrams, two by
four, 27 and a half.

1002
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,172
Don't you dare laugh.

1003
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:13,692
- (nail gun firing)
- I've gotta roll, man.

1004
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:15,142
Family stuff, huh?

1005
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,042
Yeah.

1006
00:47:18,111 --> 00:47:19,271
I didn't know you had family.

1007
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:22,909
New tattoo?

1008
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,324
Vince.

1009
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:28,614
You should just worry
about you little

1010
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,399
love story stuff, okay?

1011
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:47,416
What is the greatest
love story of all time?

1012
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:50,419
(clattering wood)

1013
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:53,249
(ethereal music)

1014
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,532
♪ I can remember ♪

1015
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:02,707
Can I get her anything
she wants on your dime?

1016
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:05,641
Yeah, that's what we
kinda had planned, so.

1017
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,194
I'll start with coffee.

1018
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:09,507
(Mrs. Cantrell) To answer
your question, parental love

1019
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:12,303
or romantic love is the
neurochemical reward

1020
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:13,442
for cooperation.

1021
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,548
Forget about the myth of
"love at first sight".

1022
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:19,310
If it's a feeling that's
only stimulated by sight

1023
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,691
it can only be lust.

1024
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,177
It's the day to day experiences.

1025
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:32,081
(ominous music)

1026
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:26,929
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1027
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:27,757
Easy with that thing, man.

1028
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:29,173
Whoa, whoa, yerself!

1029
00:49:29,242 --> 00:49:30,484
I ain't aiming it at you.

1030
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,935
Actually, you are.

1031
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:37,388
I'm here to make Vincent
Lovell pay for his sins.

1032
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:40,494
(dogs barking)

1033
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:43,646
I think we might be
able to help each other.

1034
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,568
How do you know him?

1035
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,881
(dramatic music)

1036
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,538
Thank you, sir.

1037
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:50,849
(electronic beeping)

1038
00:49:50,918 --> 00:49:51,930
(Stephen) I just
can't do it today.

1039
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:53,507
Uh, Paul?

1040
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:55,440
We needed this at 27
and a half, please.

1041
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:57,615
(Stephen) It's
gonna have to wait,

1042
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:58,823
we'll have to reschedule.

1043
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:00,031
Paul?

1044
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,481
Lily, will you
please let me talk?

1045
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,172
I can't just leave
whenever I want.

1046
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,485
Roxanne has us working
overtime, all right?

1047
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:08,557
I know we were supposed
to go out and I'm sorry.

1048
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:11,008
But it's gonna have
to be rescheduled.

1049
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:12,709
Commercial and
Boonville? Okay, what time?

1050
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:13,933
(Through The Phone) Right now!

1051
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:17,221
(buzzing saw)

1052
00:50:19,568 --> 00:50:22,226
(Stephen) You go
shopping all the time,

1053
00:50:22,295 --> 00:50:24,504
buy all the stuff
you don't even need.

1054
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:26,092
Come on, you know what.

1055
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:27,161
Ah!

1056
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:29,785
No, no, I'm fine.

1057
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:31,442
You know what, I gotta go.

1058
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:37,896
(clicking)

1059
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:45,904
(woman's breath)

1060
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:47,458
(sighs)

1061
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:50,737
You have left early quite
a bit the last few weeks.

1062
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,980
I'll be back to
full-time soon, I promise.

1063
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:57,261
Ugh, okay, be gone nincompoop.

1064
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,330
Thanks, boss.

1065
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,677
What is it, Vince?

1066
00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:03,025
Vince, what is it?

1067
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,406
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1068
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,073
Uh, the extension cord
has got a short in it.

1069
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,581
Yeah.

1070
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,721
I could fix it, but I'd
rather just buy it from you.

1071
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,790
Ha.

1072
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:17,384
Two boxes of donuts.

1073
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:18,453
Great.

1074
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,113
Consider this your down payment,

1075
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,080
Babe.

1076
00:51:23,149 --> 00:51:24,805
(chuckling)

1077
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,221
Thank you, Foxy Roxy.

1078
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:33,090
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1079
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:38,647
(light music)

1080
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,000
Hey Momma.

1081
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:48,069
Hey Llama.

1082
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:00,600
So, are you ready to tell me
what's been bothering you?

1083
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,643
I'm your mother and I know
when something's wrong

1084
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:10,851
and it's not a broken rib.

1085
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:20,998
So.

1086
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,726
What has you so
stressed out that over

1087
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:26,073
the past three years
you've aged 10?

1088
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:33,426
Whatever the case, I don't
wanna age as fast as you.

1089
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:37,430
And I don't know
what to do about

1090
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:38,914
the bank wanting
to take the house.

1091
00:52:44,747 --> 00:52:47,923
Well, I've been saving up
for a house of my own, but.

1092
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,753
I've got a little
bit in savings.

1093
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:54,309
(doorbell ringing)

1094
00:52:54,378 --> 00:52:55,378
I'll get it.

1095
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:06,252
I just wanted to say
sorry for my melt down

1096
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:07,770
at Stephen's wedding.

1097
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,463
And as a gesture of friendship,

1098
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:11,819
there's a small
town north of here

1099
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:14,674
with a sweet lake and
a bunch of cabins.

1100
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:15,744
I booked one.

1101
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:20,024
I just wanted to personally
give you an invite.

1102
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:21,508
So, are you coming?

1103
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:25,478
Dude, there is
no way I am going.

1104
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:34,797
(rooster crowing)

1105
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:37,041
(dialing)

1106
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:41,010
(Devon) Hey this is
Devon, leave a message.

1107
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:42,495
Hey Devon.

1108
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:44,945
Showed up to this sweet
cabin you were talking about.

1109
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,361
I don't see anybody here.

1110
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,811
Wondering where you guys are at.

1111
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,227
Anyway, give me a call.

1112
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:56,923
(groaning)

1113
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:02,411
(ominous music)

1114
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:15,987
This here feller's the culprit?

1115
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:17,461
That's him all right.

1116
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,222
Name's Amos, and I don't
like meeting this way

1117
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,362
but your actions gave
me no other choice.

1118
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:24,019
Oh boy, it's gonna be so good

1119
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:25,168
to finally see her get hitched.

1120
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:27,091
Okay guys, just lower the guns

1121
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,335
and let's have a
nice little talk.

1122
00:54:29,404 --> 00:54:30,405
Amos who?

1123
00:54:30,474 --> 00:54:31,751
What are you talking about?

1124
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,339
Purvis, how come this feller

1125
00:54:33,408 --> 00:54:35,651
ain't got the foggiest
notion of what we're saying?

1126
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,963
It's him, Pa.

1127
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:39,276
Two years ago I seen
him dating our sister.

1128
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:41,036
Okay, let's get
something straight.

1129
00:54:41,105 --> 00:54:43,025
Dating your sister is
something I would never do.

1130
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,073
- Hey!
- Oh, kay.

1131
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:46,490
She may not be as purdy as me,

1132
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,801
but she sure ain't ugly.

1133
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,355
Purvis.

1134
00:54:49,424 --> 00:54:52,910
Your sister said the culprit
looked like a bloated cow.

1135
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:55,119
This feller looks
like a starving...

1136
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:57,086
Don't say it, don't say it.

1137
00:54:57,155 --> 00:54:58,155
Llama.

1138
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:02,160
Pa, when we was in
Springfield two years ago,

1139
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:05,163
I seen the two of them
cozy in a blanket.

1140
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:06,337
And they kissed.

1141
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:12,239
Son, I'm grateful
that you're sheltered

1142
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,172
but not that you're dumb.

1143
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:15,519
Come to think of it,

1144
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:17,106
I don't remember
your sister talking

1145
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:18,729
to me about no marriage.

1146
00:55:19,937 --> 00:55:21,697
Did you even tell her
this feller was comin'?

1147
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:26,461
(scoffs)

1148
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,566
Get your chores
done and clean up.

1149
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,919
Come with me, young feller.

1150
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:39,957
(soft music)

1151
00:55:40,026 --> 00:55:41,545
Let me tell ya a story.

1152
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:47,067
About 20 years ago, a man
come into town, with a baby.

1153
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,172
About her age.

1154
00:55:49,863 --> 00:55:52,141
The man died when
she turned six.

1155
00:55:53,522 --> 00:55:54,558
She didn't have a ma.

1156
00:55:55,421 --> 00:55:57,354
So, we took her in.

1157
00:55:58,562 --> 00:56:01,150
As she grew, she
got all determined

1158
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:03,843
that her ma was still
alive and that she was

1159
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:05,845
gonna find her, in Springfield.

1160
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:07,502
She went there to look for her.

1161
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:10,815
One trip she come
back all twitterpated.

1162
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:12,852
Next trip...

1163
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:13,921
pregnant.

1164
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:15,681
A rapist.

1165
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,409
It's a problem in
our world I'd like

1166
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:21,447
to see us get fixed, but
we never found the rapist.

1167
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:25,451
She kept the baby, of course.

1168
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,177
Her father's name
was Mr. Valentine.

1169
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:32,250
So she took his name as her own

1170
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,287
with a little bit
of a feminine twist.

1171
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:36,462
She's faithful.

1172
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:39,534
She believes God will
bring her back to her ma.

1173
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:41,328
(sad music)

1174
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:44,401
(giggling)

1175
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,161
She's going to
Springfield next Friday.

1176
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:49,544
Do some more looking.

1177
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,100
Hey, young fella... Are
you all right?

1178
00:56:57,828 --> 00:56:59,864
Hey! Hey, we ain't done!

1179
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:01,314
This ain't over yet!

1180
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:06,008
(light music)

1181
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:07,803
(Vince) What do you
wanna do in the future?

1182
00:57:07,872 --> 00:57:10,910
(Valentina) Honestly, I
just wanna find my mom.

1183
00:57:12,118 --> 00:57:14,292
Honestly, I'd like to help you.

1184
00:57:19,505 --> 00:57:20,505
Um,

1185
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:23,162
Vince?

1186
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,095
Yeah?

1187
00:57:28,065 --> 00:57:29,653
There's something I...

1188
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:31,033
I gotta tell you.

1189
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:36,176
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1190
00:57:37,764 --> 00:57:38,764
It's okay, hey.

1191
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:41,734
You can tell me
anything, it's all right.

1192
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:44,115
(crying)

1193
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:47,049
Valentina, I love you, okay.

1194
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:48,465
Nothing's gonna change that.

1195
00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:55,092
I'm.

1196
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:56,749
(thunder cracking)

1197
00:57:56,818 --> 00:57:57,991
I'm pregnant.

1198
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,338
It's not what you think, okay.

1199
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:01,407
What?

1200
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:04,101
Will you just,
just let me explain

1201
00:58:05,102 --> 00:58:07,173
the situation and what happened?

1202
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:08,933
Because it's a lot.

1203
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:10,210
You cheated on me?

1204
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,902
No, I wouldn't cheat on you!

1205
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:14,387
I love you.

1206
00:58:14,456 --> 00:58:15,837
You know that.

1207
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:17,193
- What are you doing?
- You know what,

1208
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:17,977
No, I can't.

1209
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:18,840
I can't do this.

1210
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:19,703
I, I...

1211
00:58:19,772 --> 00:58:21,325
You can't do what?

1212
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:22,499
I'm sorry, I can't.

1213
00:58:23,465 --> 00:58:25,156
(sad music soaring)

1214
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:26,537
Vince!

1215
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:28,677
Vince, come back!

1216
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:29,746
VINCE!

1217
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:33,510
(sad, uplifting music)

1218
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:50,457
(uplifting music climax)

1219
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:15,931
Love is commitment.

1220
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:18,451
It's friendship.

1221
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:21,212
It's service.

1222
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:25,423
It's sacrifice.

1223
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,151
You did...

1224
00:59:32,396 --> 00:59:33,396
So, I will.

1225
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:39,264
Vincent?

1226
00:59:42,751 --> 00:59:44,132
I rarely see you write.

1227
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:48,135
Wedding vows.

1228
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:50,759
You have a fiance?

1229
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:54,003
A girlfriend?

1230
00:59:57,663 --> 00:59:59,561
Then who are you
writing vows to?

1231
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,907
My future.

1232
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:01,976
Anyone?

1233
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:05,015
What if she's not pretty?

1234
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:09,571
I guess I'll serve her
'til she's pretty to me.

1235
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,159
And if she cheats on you?

1236
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:17,890
(sighing)

1237
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:20,513
I won't let other's
choices tell me how to feel.

1238
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:23,343
Who I love and when I love
them is not up to them.

1239
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:24,586
It's my choice.

1240
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,692
So whoever I give
this letter to,

1241
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:28,797
if she accepts...

1242
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:31,041
I will be
committed to forever.

1243
01:00:34,872 --> 01:00:35,872
No matter.

1244
01:00:39,256 --> 01:00:40,256
Oh.

1245
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,846
What happened to my llama?

1246
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:45,295
Come here.

1247
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:48,885
Oh.

1248
01:00:53,857 --> 01:00:55,652
(grunting)

1249
01:00:57,308 --> 01:00:58,206
(smacks)

1250
01:00:58,275 --> 01:00:59,275
Oooow!
(Ben laughing)

1251
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:03,004
Nice.

1252
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:05,178
You're okay, push
through the pain.

1253
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:06,593
Okay, yeah, I got this.

1254
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,663
Hyght! Hyght!

1255
01:01:08,526 --> 01:01:09,666
Kamai hamai haaa!

1256
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:12,564
That's it.

1257
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,705
Hey, that rib's looking better.

1258
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:17,156
Are you going to the dance?

1259
01:01:17,225 --> 01:01:19,365
With smooth moves like
that, you should go.

1260
01:01:19,434 --> 01:01:21,988
Hey, take Alicia.

1261
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:23,852
She's not a heart breaker.

1262
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:27,235
Yeah, it's not really my
heart I'm worried about.

1263
01:01:29,202 --> 01:01:31,688
(light music)

1264
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,683
(strumming)

1265
01:02:08,448 --> 01:02:13,246
♪ I'll always love you ♪

1266
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:17,354
♪ No matter ♪

1267
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:20,436
I actually like that a lot
better going from D to A.

1268
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,392
Okay.

1269
01:02:21,461 --> 01:02:22,462
I say we lock it.

1270
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:23,291
Yeah, me too.

1271
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,154
Okay, cool.

1272
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:25,534
We wrote a song, yes!

1273
01:02:26,466 --> 01:02:27,951
Hooray for us.

1274
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,676
Okay, so Vince?

1275
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,608
What's up?

1276
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:31,827
Can you promise me something?

1277
01:02:31,851 --> 01:02:33,266
I can. What's up?

1278
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:35,372
If one of us dies...

1279
01:02:35,441 --> 01:02:36,649
Don't you talk like that.

1280
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:37,892
What, I...

1281
01:02:37,961 --> 01:02:39,455
Why would you ever
say something like that?

1282
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:40,342
I'm just saying that we
can't control everything

1283
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:42,275
so just hear me out, okay?

1284
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,760
Weirdo.

1285
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:49,317
Mom and Dad have always
been super cool to us.

1286
01:02:49,386 --> 01:02:51,595
So I think that we
should make a promise

1287
01:02:51,664 --> 01:02:54,080
that one of us will
always be here for them.

1288
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:02,744
(sighing)

1289
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:05,126
(slapping)

1290
01:03:06,886 --> 01:03:10,856
(guitar reverberates)

1291
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:19,830
(sirens blaring)

1292
01:03:21,142 --> 01:03:22,782
Commercial and
Boonville? Okay, what time?

1293
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:27,355
(ominous music)

1294
01:03:27,424 --> 01:03:30,565
(speaking in Spanish)

1295
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:45,613
Hello?

1296
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:52,759
(speaking in Spanish)

1297
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:02,631
I'm just passing through.

1298
01:04:04,047 --> 01:04:06,566
(speaking in Spanish)

1299
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:18,785
(sirens blaring)

1300
01:04:20,787 --> 01:04:22,617
You know what to do.

1301
01:04:30,004 --> 01:04:31,833
No, don't, please, please.

1302
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,386
Meddle in our business again...

1303
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:34,491
I won't come back.

1304
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:38,184
(ominous music)

1305
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:39,253
And I'll kill you.

1306
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:43,017
(ominous music)

1307
01:04:44,466 --> 01:04:47,573
And since the new
guy seems to know you,

1308
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,540
you locate us again,

1309
01:04:50,956 --> 01:04:53,959
and I will kill him.

1310
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,721
(ominous music)

1311
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:11,700
(disco music)

1312
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:20,709
Where's Lily?

1313
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:22,919
Um, I don't know. Over there!

1314
01:05:22,988 --> 01:05:26,267
(DJ) Ya, that's what
I'm talking about, man.

1315
01:05:27,475 --> 01:05:28,717
Hey, Stephen.

1316
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:32,031
No Lily?

1317
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,930
(indistinct chatter)

1318
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,555
We separated.

1319
01:05:38,624 --> 01:05:39,383
What?

1320
01:05:39,452 --> 01:05:40,452
(disco music)

1321
01:05:41,661 --> 01:05:43,387
It wasn't all Lily's fault.

1322
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:45,872
I made mistakes too.

1323
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,391
The first thing
he says to me is,

1324
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,049
you've been home all day,
why isn't the house clean?

1325
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:53,018
Oh, no. I would have said,
"you've been at work all day

1326
01:05:53,087 --> 01:05:53,846
why aren't we rich?"

1327
01:05:53,915 --> 01:05:55,710
(chuckling)

1328
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:57,332
We both needed
love from each other,

1329
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:59,956
but we weren't
willing to give it.

1330
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:01,612
Happy wife, happy life.

1331
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:03,614
I don't know, I think
it has to go both ways.

1332
01:06:03,683 --> 01:06:05,547
Happy spouse, happy house.

1333
01:06:05,616 --> 01:06:07,446
I mean we can't
expect to be pampered

1334
01:06:07,515 --> 01:06:10,035
without giving a
little bit in return.

1335
01:06:10,104 --> 01:06:12,485
The lights, the music,
the drinks, all of it.

1336
01:06:12,554 --> 01:06:14,142
We were so focused on the event

1337
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:17,007
that we paid no
attention to the vow.

1338
01:06:17,076 --> 01:06:20,148
Weddings, they happen
all the time, man.

1339
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:22,012
Marriages happen too little.

1340
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:28,570
(Kim) And regardless
of his mood swings,

1341
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:30,193
you need to find
a way to be happy

1342
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:31,849
without depending on him.

1343
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:33,023
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1344
01:06:33,092 --> 01:06:34,231
- Mm
- hm.

1345
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,163
My dad always
said that a marriage

1346
01:06:35,232 --> 01:06:37,545
was a reunion of two forgivers.

1347
01:06:37,614 --> 01:06:39,374
You know what might
make you feel better?

1348
01:06:39,443 --> 01:06:40,443
Let's go dance!

1349
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:44,069
(disco music)

1350
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:52,284
Hey.

1351
01:06:52,353 --> 01:06:53,112
Hey.

1352
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:54,631
How's Lena?

1353
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,700
Good.

1354
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,807
No Devon?

1355
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:02,156
Devon went out to
get some real drinks.

1356
01:07:02,225 --> 01:07:05,297
So I got to spend some time
with Lily, which was good.

1357
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:08,162
Because she's been going
through a rough time.

1358
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:09,266
Yeah.

1359
01:07:10,164 --> 01:07:11,958
But enough about my sister.

1360
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:16,170
How are you holding up?

1361
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:18,758
(peaceful music)

1362
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:20,760
Okay, you ready?

1363
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:21,934
I'm ready.

1364
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,003
All right.

1365
01:07:24,143 --> 01:07:25,143
One, two.

1366
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:26,732
No, Vince!

1367
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:27,836
What, here?

1368
01:07:27,905 --> 01:07:29,021
You end up right here, yeah.

1369
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:29,804
For real?

1370
01:07:29,873 --> 01:07:31,357
Yes, for real.

1371
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:33,094
Okay, look when I said that
I would be your dance partner

1372
01:07:33,118 --> 01:07:36,224
I didn't say I
wanted to practice

1373
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:37,777
'til the wee hours of the night.

1374
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,806
I think that you should
always be learning, Vince.

1375
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:43,645
And I mean, maybe
some day, somewhere

1376
01:07:43,714 --> 01:07:45,199
you will use these moves.

1377
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:46,062
These moves?

1378
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:48,478
Yeah, these moves.

1379
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:49,375
Okay.

1380
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:50,273
Now are you ready?

1381
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:52,275
Yes, I'm ready.

1382
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,725
And don't mess it up this time.

1383
01:07:54,794 --> 01:07:56,348
Whatever you say.

1384
01:07:57,418 --> 01:07:59,489
Okay, feel the rhythm.

1385
01:08:00,593 --> 01:08:02,457
(Together) One, two, three.

1386
01:08:02,526 --> 01:08:05,011
(peaceful dance music)

1387
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:13,677
(Vince) Who knows,
maybe the day will come

1388
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:16,152
when I can dance with her again.

1389
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:19,258
She taught me all kinds of
dips and lifts and spins.

1390
01:09:19,327 --> 01:09:20,397
What?

1391
01:09:20,466 --> 01:09:22,468
Yeah, she was good.

1392
01:09:22,537 --> 01:09:23,400
I've always wanted a brother

1393
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:24,712
to teach me how to dance.

1394
01:09:26,092 --> 01:09:27,439
Want to show me some moves?

1395
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:29,303
Me?

1396
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:30,372
Yeah.

1397
01:09:31,477 --> 01:09:32,237
Uh...

1398
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:33,479
It's fine, it's fine.

1399
01:09:33,548 --> 01:09:35,068
We'll catch Devon up
when he gets here.

1400
01:09:36,758 --> 01:09:37,758
Sure.

1401
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:40,037
It's really quite simple.

1402
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:41,729
Make sure your
feet are staggered.

1403
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:43,040
Hand goes here

1404
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,939
so you can feel
which way I'm going.

1405
01:09:45,008 --> 01:09:47,838
We put our hands together and
you just follow my lead, okay?

1406
01:09:47,907 --> 01:09:49,909
And one, two, three.

1407
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,221
Sorry about your dress.

1408
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:53,223
(Lena laughing)
There we go.

1409
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:55,950
(upbeat background music)

1410
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,335
(bass drum hit)

1411
01:10:02,853 --> 01:10:05,304
(dramatic music)

1412
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:10,206
(Lena chuckling)

1413
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:12,829
Hey babe, Vince is gonna
teach us some dance moves.

1414
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:13,898
Oh he is?

1415
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,212
Yeah, let's dance.

1416
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,215
Can I talk to you
outside for a minute?

1417
01:10:20,423 --> 01:10:21,907
(DJ) Yeah! I'm
about to bring it!

1418
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:26,222
We'll only be a moment, Lena.

1419
01:10:27,326 --> 01:10:30,087
(ominous music)

1420
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:43,663
That was a pretty
interesting stunt

1421
01:10:43,687 --> 01:10:45,137
you pulled back there, Devon.

1422
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:49,383
Trying to force me into some
kind of shotgun wedding.

1423
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:52,248
Ha, I just wanna know why.

1424
01:10:52,317 --> 01:10:54,180
To protect Lena from snakes!

1425
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,043
(smacking)

1426
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:56,873
I told you to stay away!

1427
01:10:56,942 --> 01:10:58,115
(groans & grunts)

1428
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:02,913
Devon, we can talk about this.

1429
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:04,846
There's only one
language you get!

1430
01:11:04,915 --> 01:11:06,262
(grunting)

1431
01:11:09,955 --> 01:11:11,059
(Devon growling)

1432
01:11:12,923 --> 01:11:13,855
- (bone cracking)
- Ow!!

1433
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:14,925
(dramatic piano)

1434
01:11:14,994 --> 01:11:17,618
Stay away from Lena!

1435
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,930
(groaning)

1436
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:22,795
(bell ringing)

1437
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:25,073
(ethereal music)

1438
01:11:27,386 --> 01:11:28,974
Devon!

1439
01:11:29,043 --> 01:11:30,044
Devon, stop!

1440
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:33,806
Stop, this isn't you!

1441
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:36,084
Vince apologized
and he's my friend.

1442
01:11:36,153 --> 01:11:37,672
Why are you doing this?

1443
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:41,297
(Vincent whimpering)

1444
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:43,644
Vincent?

1445
01:11:43,713 --> 01:11:44,472
(coughing)

1446
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,715
Are you okay?

1447
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:47,510
I'll send somebody to
help you, I promise.

1448
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:49,581
(Vincent) Ow.

1449
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,203
It's gonna be okay.

1450
01:11:51,272 --> 01:11:52,411
I'm here.

1451
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:54,896
I'm here.

1452
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:57,001
I'm here.

1453
01:11:57,761 --> 01:11:59,211
(ears ringing)

1454
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,178
I don't need to
know how it happened.

1455
01:12:02,594 --> 01:12:04,665
I just need to know
that it'll stop.

1456
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:10,705
No activities, son.

1457
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:14,882
I'm sure you'll be fine
walking, maybe jogging.

1458
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:17,091
But nothing else.

1459
01:12:21,406 --> 01:12:22,406
Dad?

1460
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:28,758
Is Evangeline alive?

1461
01:12:29,655 --> 01:12:32,348
(ethereal music)

1462
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:35,039
I believe so.

1463
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:38,042
Her spirit.

1464
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:43,600
(light music)

1465
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:46,154
I have felt her a few
times since she passed.

1466
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:49,226
Heard stories about angels.

1467
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,091
Ancestors.

1468
01:12:54,646 --> 01:12:56,889
Even unborn children
coming to help

1469
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,823
or comfort loved ones
during hard times.

1470
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,208
I think God sends the
ones who love us the most

1471
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:07,210
to be with us
during those times.

1472
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:09,799
(dramatic music)

1473
01:13:09,868 --> 01:13:10,869
Devon?

1474
01:13:10,938 --> 01:13:12,042
Purvis.

1475
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:13,511
We need to do
something about Vince.

1476
01:13:15,045 --> 01:13:17,462
I'll pay any price to
get him outta my life

1477
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:18,911
and away from my girl.

1478
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,465
Well, he did date
my sister around

1479
01:13:20,534 --> 01:13:22,190
the time she got pregnant.

1480
01:13:22,259 --> 01:13:23,019
(munching)

1481
01:13:23,088 --> 01:13:24,330
What are you saying?

1482
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,368
What I'm saying is,
he got me ticked off.

1483
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:31,786
And for the right price, I'll
stand witness against him.

1484
01:13:33,478 --> 01:13:34,996
For what?

1485
01:13:35,065 --> 01:13:37,551
(munching)

1486
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,104
Who did this to you?

1487
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:40,346
Mom, it's okay.

1488
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,728
No, I'll make sure
the police get this guy.

1489
01:13:44,143 --> 01:13:46,801
The good book says
"love your enemies,

1490
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,285
do good to those that hate you,

1491
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:50,218
pray for those who
despite-fully use you."

1492
01:13:50,287 --> 01:13:51,116
It's no big deal, I'm fine.

1493
01:13:51,185 --> 01:13:53,429
(doorbell ringing)

1494
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,408
(Clark) Good evening, ma'am.

1495
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:08,754
(Olivia) May I help you?

1496
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:12,206
(Clark) My name's
Detective Alfred Clark.

1497
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:13,942
I'm with the Springfield
Police Department.

1498
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:15,934
I have a few questions
I need to ask your son.

1499
01:14:16,003 --> 01:14:16,900
May we come in?

1500
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:18,143
Yeah, come on in.

1501
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:20,145
He can describe the
man who assaulted him.

1502
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:21,640
Actually, I have a
warrant for his arrest.

1503
01:14:21,664 --> 01:14:23,010
What?

1504
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:23,907
No, wait a minute.

1505
01:14:23,976 --> 01:14:25,461
He's the victim!

1506
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,730
Ma'am, I will warn you, I
don't have a whole lot of time

1507
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:29,223
so if you make any
kind of trouble

1508
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:30,890
you'll be looking at
an arrest of your own.

1509
01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:32,778
Yeah, well then take me!

1510
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:33,847
(Vince) Mom, stop.

1511
01:14:34,711 --> 01:14:36,299
It's okay, it's okay.

1512
01:14:38,128 --> 01:14:39,267
What are the charges?

1513
01:14:41,097 --> 01:14:42,961
Vincent Lovell,
you're under arrest

1514
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,341
under suspicion of rape.

1515
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,826
(dramatic music)

1516
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:48,000
You have the right
to remain silent.

1517
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:50,037
Anything you say
can and will be used

1518
01:14:50,106 --> 01:14:51,556
against you in a court of law.

1519
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:56,768
(cracking thunder)

1520
01:14:58,148 --> 01:15:00,116
(more dramatic music)

1521
01:15:13,612 --> 01:15:14,371
(cell door beeps)

1522
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,649
(cell door shuts)

1523
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:42,607
Arresting criminals
is one thing.

1524
01:15:43,849 --> 01:15:47,025
Convincing the judge to
convict them is another.

1525
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:51,339
That's why witnesses
are so important.

1526
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,930
(Draper) For example,
there's a man,

1527
01:15:55,999 --> 01:15:57,967
if you wanna call him
a man, Vincent Lovell,

1528
01:15:58,036 --> 01:16:00,348
who was recently
arrested for rape.

1529
01:16:04,836 --> 01:16:09,772
He is soon to be yet another
conviction on my ledger.

1530
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:12,913
And that man is going away.

1531
01:16:12,982 --> 01:16:14,017
(dramatic hit)

1532
01:16:14,086 --> 01:16:16,468
(sad music)

1533
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,956
(Draper) He's going to be
locked up for a long time

1534
01:16:22,025 --> 01:16:25,581
and if I have my way, he's
going to be locked up for life.

1535
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:28,963
Because it is important for

1536
01:16:29,032 --> 01:16:32,104
the citizens of this
city and of this county

1537
01:16:32,173 --> 01:16:35,314
that men like this, ugh... sorry

1538
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:36,971
Creeps like this...

1539
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,766
are taken off our streets.

1540
01:16:38,835 --> 01:16:39,974
Lovell, get up.

1541
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:41,804
(Draper) For everyone's safety.

1542
01:16:41,873 --> 01:16:43,288
You made bail.

1543
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:44,841
Get up!

1544
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:45,980
Time to go.

1545
01:16:46,049 --> 01:16:47,706
I don't know why
they're letting ya out.

1546
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:49,639
I'm just gonna see you
right after the trial.

1547
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:51,779
(indistinct prison chatter)

1548
01:16:53,022 --> 01:16:53,954
It's important to
get these criminals

1549
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:55,438
off our streets for the safety

1550
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:58,752
of the citizens of Springfield
and all of Greene County.

1551
01:16:58,821 --> 01:17:00,892
She couldn't wait
until after the trial.

1552
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:04,620
What is it with society
wanting to paint people

1553
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:06,898
as criminals without any proof.

1554
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:08,382
(knocking)

1555
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:09,970
(office chatter)
(phone ringing)

1556
01:17:11,385 --> 01:17:13,666
Despite my protests, your
friendly neighborhood prosecutor

1557
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:15,907
pushed for the judge
to have this installed.

1558
01:17:18,495 --> 01:17:22,154
Most of my career, you
had to have a witness

1559
01:17:22,223 --> 01:17:25,054
to the victim to
be able to arrest

1560
01:17:25,123 --> 01:17:27,228
and monitor an alleged criminal.

1561
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:28,747
(electronic beeping)

1562
01:17:30,335 --> 01:17:33,372
Now it's just guilty
until proven innocent.

1563
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:35,454
Look, you've been calm
through this and cooperative.

1564
01:17:35,478 --> 01:17:37,756
Which is rare.

1565
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:39,044
Look, with all the
hate out there,

1566
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:41,657
I'd rather be focusing
on the cartel case.

1567
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:44,142
That ankle monitor
is run by GPS.

1568
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:47,145
You have to be at the
address that's on your file

1569
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:49,354
by 8:00 P.M. every night.

1570
01:17:50,735 --> 01:17:52,668
You stay out of trouble
until the trial,

1571
01:17:52,737 --> 01:17:54,704
all this clears up.

1572
01:17:54,773 --> 01:17:55,636
But listen,

1573
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,155
if you don't follow protocol,

1574
01:17:57,224 --> 01:17:58,777
I'm gonna have to
arrest you again.

1575
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,893
And it's almost guaranteed
that you're gonna go to prison

1576
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:05,197
for a very, very,
uncomfortably long time.

1577
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:06,751
See ya after the trial.

1578
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:10,858
Go on.

1579
01:18:10,927 --> 01:18:11,927
(prison door buzzing)

1580
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:22,283
Could you use some breakfast?

1581
01:18:22,352 --> 01:18:24,527
I don't have an
appetite, Dad, thanks.

1582
01:18:33,812 --> 01:18:35,124
Please tell me it's not true.

1583
01:18:35,193 --> 01:18:36,642
It's not.

1584
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,714
Did you help the lady down
the street like I asked?

1585
01:18:38,783 --> 01:18:41,820
Yes! Why didn't ever
tell me about that.

1586
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:43,063
Okay, I'm sorry.

1587
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:44,271
How many more times

1588
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,558
are you gonna actually
make me apologize?

1589
01:18:45,582 --> 01:18:46,782
Sorry is just not gonna cut it.

1590
01:18:46,825 --> 01:18:48,216
Look, I'm taking
classes to fix this.

1591
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,415
I'm taking AA, I'm
taking anger management...

1592
01:18:50,484 --> 01:18:51,599
And you're still not listening!

1593
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:52,797
- But...
- NO!

1594
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:54,695
I told you Vincent
was just my friend!

1595
01:18:56,593 --> 01:18:58,216
(cracking thunder)

1596
01:18:58,285 --> 01:18:59,285
Okay.

1597
01:19:04,429 --> 01:19:05,429
The truth is,

1598
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:09,399
I messed up.

1599
01:19:12,126 --> 01:19:13,783
But I will do anything for you.

1600
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:17,787
(rolling thunder)

1601
01:19:30,662 --> 01:19:33,216
You were there for
me through everything.

1602
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:37,186
Now I'm gonna be there for you.

1603
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:43,502
Okay, that's enough
apologizing for one day.

1604
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:51,303
(somber music)

1605
01:20:03,764 --> 01:20:06,422
(phone buzzing)

1606
01:20:12,014 --> 01:20:13,222
Yeah?

1607
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:14,982
Dealing drugs is a
slippery slope, man.

1608
01:20:15,051 --> 01:20:17,260
You gotta find a way out.

1609
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:18,744
There's only one way out.

1610
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:20,919
Then we find another.

1611
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,828
You don't wanna be
remembered as a drug dealer.

1612
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:23,852
Really?

1613
01:20:25,268 --> 01:20:27,823
You gonna put a label on me?

1614
01:20:27,892 --> 01:20:30,653
The only label I'd
have for you is "friend".

1615
01:20:30,722 --> 01:20:32,379
Well, at least
I'm not a "rapist".

1616
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:40,836
(sighing)

1617
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:43,977
(saddening music)

1618
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:47,118
I don't know if
you're there, God.

1619
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:50,984
Whoever you are.

1620
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:52,330
(rain on window)

1621
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:55,229
(thunder clapping)

1622
01:20:55,298 --> 01:20:56,886
But if You're there.

1623
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:06,896
There's a lot of people out
here that could use Your help.

1624
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:10,589
I know it's difficult to work

1625
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,522
but I won't let it stop
me to get things done.

1626
01:21:15,077 --> 01:21:17,424
And I just spent all my savings.

1627
01:21:17,493 --> 01:21:18,493
You're fired.

1628
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,361
I brought you some donuts.

1629
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:27,261
No, Vincent.

1630
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:32,197
You are fired.

1631
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:37,168
And don't call me
babe, or Foxy Roxy.

1632
01:21:49,007 --> 01:21:50,284
Whatever you say.

1633
01:21:53,494 --> 01:21:54,599
Mrs. Valentine.

1634
01:21:57,567 --> 01:21:58,568
What?

1635
01:21:58,637 --> 01:22:01,330
Your husband, Mr. Valentine.

1636
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:05,851
Took your daughter
when she was two.

1637
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,094
(somber music)

1638
01:22:07,163 --> 01:22:08,578
Somehow thought you'd never look

1639
01:22:08,647 --> 01:22:10,373
in a small town north of here.

1640
01:22:12,513 --> 01:22:15,413
He never told her what your
name was, where you lived.

1641
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,448
Who you were.

1642
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:19,969
And then he died.

1643
01:22:21,419 --> 01:22:24,008
And the local neighbors, they
didn't know who you were.

1644
01:22:25,526 --> 01:22:26,526
So how could she?

1645
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,948
I know why you're
firing me, Roxanne.

1646
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:39,644
Because apparently,
I'm a rapist.

1647
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,234
You wanna know
who the victim is?

1648
01:22:47,031 --> 01:22:48,031
Your daughter.

1649
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,936
And she's in town today.

1650
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:57,110
Where!?

1651
01:22:57,179 --> 01:22:58,456
Where is she?

1652
01:23:00,596 --> 01:23:01,942
I burned that bridge, too.

1653
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:06,671
(saddening music)

1654
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:14,437
(sobbing)

1655
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:21,410
(saddening music)

1656
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,728
(Lily) Ladies and
gentlemen, the happy couple.

1657
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:32,835
(cheering)

1658
01:23:32,904 --> 01:23:34,388
Congratulations.

1659
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,184
Congrats.
(laughing)

1660
01:23:37,253 --> 01:23:40,291
Let me see the
ring, let me see it.

1661
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,224
(indistinct chatter)

1662
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:47,746
Hey, you don't need that.

1663
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:48,851
(Janelle) It's beautiful!

1664
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,164
(chattering)

1665
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:52,648
Ha, okay! Bye.

1666
01:23:53,787 --> 01:23:54,971
(Tara) Okay, walk us through it.

1667
01:23:54,995 --> 01:23:56,169
(Lena) Okay, so.

1668
01:23:57,101 --> 01:23:58,826
Chaaaadd!

1669
01:23:58,895 --> 01:24:00,380
(laughing)

1670
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,140
I'm proud of you,
I'm proud of you.

1671
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:03,209
Thank you.

1672
01:24:03,245 --> 01:24:04,487
(chuckling)

1673
01:24:04,556 --> 01:24:05,902
Mike, my man.

1674
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:07,283
It's good to see you.

1675
01:24:07,352 --> 01:24:08,352
Uncle Ron!

1676
01:24:08,388 --> 01:24:09,906
Hey!

1677
01:24:09,975 --> 01:24:11,494
You gone and done and done it.

1678
01:24:11,563 --> 01:24:12,816
Here we go, down
the hatch, my friends.

1679
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,703
- Down the hatch.
- Down the hatch.

1680
01:24:13,772 --> 01:24:15,567
Here we go, here's to the...

1681
01:24:15,636 --> 01:24:18,501
(murmuring)

1682
01:24:19,502 --> 01:24:22,367
(gagging)

1683
01:24:22,436 --> 01:24:24,024
(Ben) No, no, no, no.

1684
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:25,853
No, that's not good.

1685
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,414
(knocking)

1686
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:39,143
Thanks for coming.

1687
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:40,213
Come on in.

1688
01:24:43,837 --> 01:24:47,185
Vince, what is this all about?

1689
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,740
I have nothing to say to him.

1690
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,921
I killed Evangeline.

1691
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:03,270
(light music)

1692
01:25:07,032 --> 01:25:09,759
The two of you were actually
gone on a date that night.

1693
01:25:12,935 --> 01:25:14,074
I got home from my own date

1694
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:15,834
where I broke up
with my girlfriend.

1695
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:18,872
Vince, come back!

1696
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:19,700
(honking)

1697
01:25:19,769 --> 01:25:20,977
Evangeline!

1698
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:21,702
We're late for the
party, let's go.

1699
01:25:21,771 --> 01:25:22,772
Scott?

1700
01:25:24,257 --> 01:25:25,257
Yeah, I know, I know.

1701
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:26,017
She's coming.

1702
01:25:26,086 --> 01:25:27,087
I know dude, I know.

1703
01:25:28,261 --> 01:25:29,917
Vince, I'm so glad you're here.

1704
01:25:29,986 --> 01:25:32,644
Can you please tell Scott
that I'm not going with him?

1705
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:35,268
Why?

1706
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:36,441
He's drunk.

1707
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:37,442
(honking)

1708
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:38,995
Look, I love you, kiddo,

1709
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:41,042
but if I go tell him, he's
just gonna be persistent.

1710
01:25:41,066 --> 01:25:42,285
Okay, maybe you should tell him.

1711
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:45,450
Vince, he'll think
that I don't like him.

1712
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:46,979
If he's gonna know
that you don't wanna go

1713
01:25:47,003 --> 01:25:48,443
you should be the
one that tells him.

1714
01:25:48,488 --> 01:25:49,488
(gasping)

1715
01:25:50,455 --> 01:25:53,562
Look, right now I
don't have the strength.

1716
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:55,080
I need you.

1717
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,325
You know, Valentina
told me that same thing.

1718
01:25:58,394 --> 01:26:00,016
Vince, I need you.

1719
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:02,778
No, Ang, what you
need is a brain.

1720
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:04,883
Maybe then, you'd pick
a decent boyfriend.

1721
01:26:07,265 --> 01:26:09,371
Okay, he's probably
cheating on you anyway.

1722
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:11,614
It's the going thing these days.

1723
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:12,822
(gasping)

1724
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:14,169
Vince.

1725
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:15,825
Love never lasts.

1726
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:17,827
(cracking thunder)

1727
01:26:19,001 --> 01:26:20,830
So this is what you call love?

1728
01:26:25,318 --> 01:26:26,733
I don't know anymore.

1729
01:26:26,802 --> 01:26:28,769
(honking)

1730
01:26:28,838 --> 01:26:30,392
Babe! Let's go!

1731
01:26:32,635 --> 01:26:35,466
Yeah well maybe you
should figure that out.

1732
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,024
You know, I still
love you Vince...

1733
01:26:42,852 --> 01:26:43,852
no matter.

1734
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:47,754
(soft music)

1735
01:26:51,516 --> 01:26:52,897
(engine starting)

1736
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,300
That was the last
thing she said to me.

1737
01:27:17,784 --> 01:27:21,512
(light music)

1738
01:27:21,581 --> 01:27:22,927
I could have stopped her.

1739
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:27,413
Instead...

1740
01:27:28,864 --> 01:27:29,864
I killed her.

1741
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,081
And, my actions...

1742
01:27:41,532 --> 01:27:42,843
led to your divorce.

1743
01:27:45,087 --> 01:27:47,572
(light music)

1744
01:27:50,368 --> 01:27:53,992
I tried to mask my
pain and my guilt.

1745
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:56,063
Going to parties
and drinking alcohol

1746
01:27:56,132 --> 01:27:58,756
and hanging with loose women.

1747
01:28:00,896 --> 01:28:01,896
I'm sorry, Mom.

1748
01:28:04,796 --> 01:28:05,796
Dad.

1749
01:28:07,937 --> 01:28:11,147
(light music)

1750
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:12,321
Son,

1751
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:13,978
when your greatest of mistakes

1752
01:28:15,117 --> 01:28:16,912
become your greatest ministry,

1753
01:28:18,948 --> 01:28:20,467
Grace has come full circle.

1754
01:28:22,504 --> 01:28:23,504
Let Him in.

1755
01:28:25,645 --> 01:28:28,130
(light music)

1756
01:29:01,715 --> 01:29:04,753
(woman breathing)

1757
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,934
(ominous music)

1758
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,756
Vincent, I know that
you can't see me but

1759
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:44,655
I hope that you can
feel that I'm here.

1760
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,039
(ominous music)

1761
01:29:52,835 --> 01:29:54,492
Vincent.

1762
01:29:54,561 --> 01:29:55,769
Vincent, what are you doing?

1763
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,395
Vince, no.

1764
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:01,706
Put, put the gun down.

1765
01:30:01,775 --> 01:30:02,983
(gun cocking)

1766
01:30:03,052 --> 01:30:04,122
(music intensifying)

1767
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:05,261
Put the gun down.

1768
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:07,229
Vincent, this is not the answer.

1769
01:30:07,298 --> 01:30:08,644
It's not your time!

1770
01:30:08,713 --> 01:30:10,922
Vincent! Please!

1771
01:30:10,991 --> 01:30:12,614
Help him know that he is loved.

1772
01:30:12,683 --> 01:30:15,306
Lord, help Vince
feel Your presence.

1773
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:19,137
Vincent, no, think about Mom!

1774
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,967
Vincent, think about Dad!

1775
01:30:21,036 --> 01:30:22,244
YOU PROMISED!

1776
01:30:27,387 --> 01:30:29,113
(guitar strings vibrating)

1777
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:34,325
(guitar reverberating)

1778
01:30:43,196 --> 01:30:44,196
Ang?

1779
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,444
Evangeline?

1780
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,378
Is that you?

1781
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,759
Yes, Vince, I'm here.

1782
01:30:56,105 --> 01:30:57,175
I've always been here.

1783
01:30:59,315 --> 01:31:00,696
Do it.

1784
01:31:00,765 --> 01:31:01,765
(light music)

1785
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:04,181
What?

1786
01:31:05,149 --> 01:31:06,530
I didn't say anything.

1787
01:31:06,599 --> 01:31:07,807
Do it.

1788
01:31:07,876 --> 01:31:09,740
What is the greatest
love story of all time?

1789
01:31:09,809 --> 01:31:11,949
(clattering wood)

1790
01:31:12,018 --> 01:31:13,433
Love never lasts.

1791
01:31:13,502 --> 01:31:17,713
(Einstein) God is
love and love is God.

1792
01:31:17,782 --> 01:31:19,819
- (woman breathing)
- Keep it.

1793
01:31:28,034 --> 01:31:31,278

01:33:25,151 --> 01:33:26,324
Scout's honor.

1810
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:27,740
(Kadasha) You'll be here, huh?

1811
01:33:28,672 --> 01:33:29,811
(Leon) It's an action, man.

1812
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:32,503
Selfishness says, "what
can you do for me?"

1813
01:33:32,572 --> 01:33:34,574
Love asks, "what
can I do for you?"

1814
01:33:34,643 --> 01:33:36,369
(Clark) That ankle
monitor's run by GPS.

1815
01:33:36,438 --> 01:33:38,785
You have to be at the
address that's on your file

1816
01:33:38,854 --> 01:33:40,580
by 8:00 P.M. every night.

1817
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:41,857
If you don't follow protocol,

1818
01:33:41,926 --> 01:33:43,479
I'm gonna have to
arrest you again.

1819
01:33:43,548 --> 01:33:45,492
And it's almost guaranteed
that you're gonna go to prison

1820
01:33:45,516 --> 01:33:48,381
for a very,
uncomfortably long time.

1821
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:49,450
It's no use.

1822
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,046
(ominous music)

1823
01:33:58,115 --> 01:33:59,575
(Hardy) I mean, if
we spend as much time

1824
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:01,566
investing in loving
someone rather

1825
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,465
than seeking to be loved,

1826
01:34:03,534 --> 01:34:05,743
man, our relationships
would thrive.

1827
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:08,746
(Alicia) If it's real,
it costs; it hurts.

1828
01:34:10,196 --> 01:34:13,268
(Brick) Meddle in our business
again and I'll kill ya.

1829
01:34:13,337 --> 01:34:14,890
There's only one way out.

1830
01:34:14,959 --> 01:34:17,341
(Toni) And since the new
guy seems to know you,

1831
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,551
you locate us again
and I will kill him.

1832
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,621
December 20th.

1833
01:34:23,796 --> 01:34:25,383
(Vince Voiceover)
Love is commitment...

1834
01:34:27,696 --> 01:34:28,904
it's friendship.

1835
01:34:28,973 --> 01:34:31,182
(Amos) She's going to
Springfield next Friday.

1836
01:34:32,908 --> 01:34:34,108
(Vince Voiceover)
It's service.

1837
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:35,979
Where?

1838
01:34:36,809 --> 01:34:37,809
It's sacrifice.

1839
01:34:39,259 --> 01:34:40,259
You did...

1840
01:34:42,435 --> 01:34:44,023
so I will.

1841
01:34:44,092 --> 01:34:46,819
(dramatic music)

1842
01:35:01,074 --> 01:35:03,559
Vincent, what are you doing?

1843
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,700
Vincent!

1844
01:35:09,186 --> 01:35:11,982
(revving engine)

1845
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:13,500
Vincent, where are you going?

1846
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:14,569
VINCENT!

1847
01:35:15,744 --> 01:35:18,471
(dramatic music)

1848
01:35:20,231 --> 01:35:21,750
(electronic beeping)

1849
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:22,958
Uh, detective.

1850
01:35:23,027 --> 01:35:24,408
There's a blip on my screen.

1851
01:35:24,477 --> 01:35:26,179
It's Mr. Lovell, he's
probably leaving the state.

1852
01:35:26,203 --> 01:35:27,203
I'm on it.

1853
01:35:29,171 --> 01:35:30,621
Keep me posted on where he goes.

1854
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:32,278
All right, call me
if you need backup.

1855
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:38,111
(phone ringing)

1856
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:41,079
Olivia?

1857
01:35:41,114 --> 01:35:42,114
Leon.

1858
01:35:43,323 --> 01:35:45,360
I think Vince was
trying to say goodbye.

1859
01:35:45,429 --> 01:35:46,499
(phone ringing)

1860
01:35:46,568 --> 01:35:47,327
(D'Qwell) Hey, it's D'Qwell.

1861
01:35:47,396 --> 01:35:48,708
I'm probably playing...

1862
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,024
(Laurel) Everybody,
time for cake!

1863
01:35:54,093 --> 01:35:55,439
(Children) Yay!

1864
01:35:55,508 --> 01:35:56,923
(Kid) I don't like footballs.

1865
01:35:56,992 --> 01:35:58,925
(Child) That looks amazing.

1866
01:35:58,994 --> 01:36:00,651
(cracking)

1867
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,997
What the?

1868
01:36:04,828 --> 01:36:06,553
(hissing)

1869
01:36:06,622 --> 01:36:09,039
Not good, not good, not good!

1870
01:36:10,454 --> 01:36:13,215
(children playing)

1871
01:36:13,284 --> 01:36:14,699
Is Vince coming?

1872
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:20,118
Son.

1873
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:25,193
Sometimes people aren't
who you think they are.

1874
01:36:25,262 --> 01:36:28,127
(children playing)

1875
01:36:31,233 --> 01:36:33,926
(dramatic music)

1876
01:36:43,659 --> 01:36:45,869
(Officer) He's on Fremont
and St. Louis Street.

1877
01:36:45,938 --> 01:36:46,801
I don't see him anywhere.

1878
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:48,112
Oh, that's his car all right.

1879
01:36:49,734 --> 01:36:51,540
There's something wrong with
my service, stay on the line.

1880
01:36:51,564 --> 01:36:52,461
(Officer) Okay.

1881
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:53,808
(revving engine)

1882
01:36:54,947 --> 01:36:56,465
Where are you, son?

1883
01:36:56,534 --> 01:36:58,882
(car zooming)

1884
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:01,954
(dramatic music)

1885
01:37:02,023 --> 01:37:04,059
(phone ringing)

1886
01:37:06,579 --> 01:37:08,201
(sirens blaring)

1887
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:09,582
D'Qwell come on.

1888
01:37:09,651 --> 01:37:10,651
Come on, pick up.

1889
01:37:12,343 --> 01:37:13,343
Pick up, man!

1890
01:37:14,656 --> 01:37:15,519
(D'Qwell Voicemail)
Hey, it's D'Qwell.

1891
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:17,314
I'm probably playing with my kid

1892
01:37:17,383 --> 01:37:19,247
and doing stuff my
wife told me to do.

1893
01:37:21,697 --> 01:37:24,459
(sirens blaring)

1894
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,015
What do I do?

1895
01:37:29,084 --> 01:37:31,259
They will kill me.

1896
01:37:31,328 --> 01:37:32,328
What's right?

1897
01:37:33,537 --> 01:37:35,480
(Laurel) All right everybody,
it's time to go inside!

1898
01:37:35,504 --> 01:37:36,505
- (Children) Aw!
- What!?

1899
01:37:36,574 --> 01:37:37,437
Come on!

1900
01:37:37,506 --> 01:37:38,506
I guess he's not coming.

1901
01:37:38,542 --> 01:37:39,439
See ya later, man.

1902
01:37:39,508 --> 01:37:40,302
(sighing)

1903
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:41,648
See ya later.

1904
01:37:46,274 --> 01:37:47,274
God,

1905
01:37:48,621 --> 01:37:49,656
if you're even there.

1906
01:37:51,693 --> 01:37:53,488
I could sure use
your help right now.

1907
01:37:53,557 --> 01:37:54,869
Can you give me something?

1908
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,114
Could you give me a sign?

1909
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,292
(dramatic music intensifying)

1910
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:10,643
(screeching)

1911
01:38:10,712 --> 01:38:12,265
(crackling fireworks)

1912
01:38:12,334 --> 01:38:13,197
Fireworks!

1913
01:38:13,266 --> 01:38:14,198
(children shouting)

1914
01:38:14,267 --> 01:38:16,269
(climatic, heroic music)

1915
01:38:22,379 --> 01:38:23,483
Whoa.

1916
01:38:23,552 --> 01:38:25,692
(children cheering)

1917
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:31,043
Fireworks!

1918
01:38:31,112 --> 01:38:34,080
(children laughing)

1919
01:38:37,394 --> 01:38:39,085
Kyson!

1920
01:38:39,154 --> 01:38:40,362
Go long!

1921
01:38:43,676 --> 01:38:45,505
(children cheering)

1922
01:38:45,574 --> 01:38:46,575
Heavens yeah, babe!

1923
01:38:53,306 --> 01:38:54,998
Baby, you're right.

1924
01:38:56,344 --> 01:38:59,036
Sometimes people aren't
who we think they are.

1925
01:39:00,969 --> 01:39:02,867
(dramatic music subsiding)

1926
01:39:04,697 --> 01:39:06,285
(soft dramatic music)

1927
01:39:06,354 --> 01:39:07,562
Where is he now?

1928
01:39:07,631 --> 01:39:10,461
Right now he's headed
west on Traffic Way.

1929
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:12,532
(hissing)

1930
01:39:13,499 --> 01:39:14,879
No.

1931
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,951
He's not here.

1932
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:18,307
Olivia, maybe you
should just stay there

1933
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:19,505
in case he comes back.

1934
01:39:19,574 --> 01:39:20,792
I'll go ahead and
check downtown.

1935
01:39:20,816 --> 01:39:22,577
I don't know, just keep looking.

1936
01:39:28,997 --> 01:39:31,482
(light music)

1937
01:39:41,216 --> 01:39:42,493
(Leon) How's your mother?

1938
01:39:42,562 --> 01:39:45,393
(Vince) Bank wants
to take her house.

1939
01:39:45,462 --> 01:39:46,462
(Leon) Really?

1940
01:39:47,567 --> 01:39:49,052
(Vince) I mean,
I've been saving up

1941
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:51,537
for a house of my own, but I
got a little bit in savings.

1942
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:55,575
(light music)

1943
01:40:06,345 --> 01:40:07,553
Got him in my sights.

1944
01:40:10,694 --> 01:40:12,144
He dropped something.

1945
01:40:13,869 --> 01:40:15,078
(screeching tires)

1946
01:40:16,976 --> 01:40:19,461
(light music)

1947
01:40:36,064 --> 01:40:37,272
(Clark) I'm following him.

1948
01:40:37,341 --> 01:40:39,757
I don't think he's
leaving the state.

1949
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:40,826
(intense music)

1950
01:40:43,451 --> 01:40:44,383
Boss.

1951
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:45,246
No.

1952
01:40:45,315 --> 01:40:47,041
Come on.

1953
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,697
There is no way out.

1954
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,877
And there will be
no fence sitters

1955
01:40:55,946 --> 01:40:56,947
ON MY CREW!

1956
01:40:57,016 --> 01:40:58,500
(gun cocking)

1957
01:40:58,569 --> 01:41:00,606
(gunshot)

1958
01:41:00,675 --> 01:41:02,504
Shots fired, I
repeat, shots fired.

1959
01:41:03,885 --> 01:41:04,989
(gunshot reverberating)

1960
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,853
VINCENT!

1961
01:41:08,096 --> 01:41:08,890
(gunshot)

1962
01:41:08,959 --> 01:41:09,959
Ah!

1963
01:41:11,755 --> 01:41:14,413
(intense music)

1964
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:19,106
(gunshot)

1965
01:41:20,419 --> 01:41:21,465
I know you don't want
to do this either, Brick.

1966
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:22,489
I want this one.

1967
01:41:23,491 --> 01:41:25,700
(gunshots)

1968
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:29,704
(dramatic music)

1969
01:41:29,773 --> 01:41:31,844
(indistinct fighting sounds)

1970
01:41:31,913 --> 01:41:33,639
(grunting and groaning)

1971
01:41:33,708 --> 01:41:35,054
(knife unsheathing)

1972
01:41:41,543 --> 01:41:43,476
(whirring)

1973
01:41:43,545 --> 01:41:45,064
(grunting and groaning)

1974
01:41:45,133 --> 01:41:47,101
(fast whirring)

1975
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:48,170
(growling)

1976
01:41:50,966 --> 01:41:54,038
(indistinct threatening)
(whirring)

1977
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:57,732
(grunting, groaning)
(music intensifying)

1978
01:42:02,392 --> 01:42:03,392
- Stop!
- Ah!

1979
01:42:04,394 --> 01:42:05,947
(gunshot)

1980
01:42:06,016 --> 01:42:07,051
(electric buzzing)

1981
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,121
Ugh!

1982
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,401
Uh, detective.
(flatlining beep)

1983
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:13,196
We lost connection.

1984
01:42:13,265 --> 01:42:14,404
What?

1985
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:15,750
Give me his last location.

1986
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:18,511
Brick.

1987
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:19,580
(smacking)

1988
01:42:19,616 --> 01:42:21,894
(gun clicking)

1989
01:42:23,482 --> 01:42:25,760
You have no idea
what you're up against.

1990
01:42:25,829 --> 01:42:27,520
In my business.

1991
01:42:27,589 --> 01:42:29,384
No one messes with the cartel.

1992
01:42:29,453 --> 01:42:30,592
We'll kill you.

1993
01:42:30,661 --> 01:42:32,215
(indistinct threatening)

1994
01:42:32,284 --> 01:42:35,597
(dramatic music intensifying)
(more threatening, barking)

1995
01:42:37,565 --> 01:42:38,807
(music stops)

1996
01:42:39,808 --> 01:42:41,465
Dance with me.

1997
01:42:41,534 --> 01:42:42,294
(peaceful music fading in)

1998
01:42:42,363 --> 01:42:43,881
(deeply sighing)

1999
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,950
Trust me.

2000
01:42:48,403 --> 01:42:51,199
(uplifting music)

2001
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:12,186
(speaking in Spanish)
(indistinct chatter)

2002
01:43:14,118 --> 01:43:15,603
(Paul coughing)

2003
01:43:15,672 --> 01:43:16,983
(Thug) Hurry up.

2004
01:43:17,052 --> 01:43:19,331
(coughing)

2005
01:43:20,918 --> 01:43:23,369
Easy does it. Easy does it.

2006
01:43:23,438 --> 01:43:24,439
You all right?

2007
01:43:24,508 --> 01:43:25,889
Huh?

2008
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:28,374
Vince, how'd you do that?

2009
01:43:29,341 --> 01:43:32,551
(cartel speaking in Spanish)

2010
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,862
My sister taught me.

2011
01:43:36,486 --> 01:43:37,556
Listen, Vince.

2012
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:38,419
Save it, Paul.

2013
01:43:38,488 --> 01:43:39,592
Vince, I have a son.

2014
01:43:39,661 --> 01:43:40,835
(distant sirens blaring)

2015
01:43:40,904 --> 01:43:42,733
Henry, he's four years old.

2016
01:43:43,976 --> 01:43:46,081
I didn't even know he
existed 'til a month ago

2017
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:48,256
and now I have to
take care of him.

2018
01:43:48,325 --> 01:43:50,327
And framing wasn't cutting it.

2019
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:52,132
I know I shouldn't have got
in so deep with these guys

2020
01:43:52,156 --> 01:43:53,617
but I didn't have a choice!
Hey, hey, hey!

2021
01:43:53,641 --> 01:43:55,090
Here's your chance
to get out, okay.

2022
01:43:55,159 --> 01:43:57,438
You can either selfishly run,

2023
01:43:57,507 --> 01:43:59,198
or you can show some
love for your city

2024
01:43:59,267 --> 01:44:00,717
(sirens getting closer)

2025
01:44:00,786 --> 01:44:05,239
And tell the detective who's
on his way everything you know.

2026
01:44:05,308 --> 01:44:06,948
(Thug) Is there really
a detective coming?

2027
01:44:06,999 --> 01:44:08,690
Park Central Square.

2028
01:44:08,759 --> 01:44:10,347
(Thug) Guy's we
gotta get outta here.

2029
01:44:10,416 --> 01:44:11,624
(sighing)

2030
01:44:11,693 --> 01:44:13,799
(light music)

2031
01:44:13,868 --> 01:44:14,972
The choice is yours.

2032
01:44:18,321 --> 01:44:19,321
Vince.

2033
01:44:21,116 --> 01:44:23,602
(light music)

2034
01:44:25,328 --> 01:44:27,295
(deep breath)

2035
01:44:27,364 --> 01:44:29,332
(wind blowing)
(woman breathing)

2036
01:44:30,747 --> 01:44:32,404
Babe, how much have you had?

2037
01:44:32,473 --> 01:44:34,198
Oh, just a couple.

2038
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,442
I'll be fine, don't
worry about it.

2039
01:44:41,723 --> 01:44:42,483
You ready to go?

2040
01:44:42,552 --> 01:44:43,552
Sure.

2041
01:44:44,761 --> 01:44:47,039
(light music building)

2042
01:44:47,108 --> 01:44:50,491
(woman's breath)

2043
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,596
I think we should check
Park Central Square.

2044
01:44:52,665 --> 01:44:55,323
Well how do you know he's there?

2045
01:44:55,392 --> 01:44:57,394
Just a feeling.

2046
01:44:57,463 --> 01:44:59,810
(woman's breath)

2047
01:44:59,879 --> 01:45:01,674
(light music)

2048
01:45:01,743 --> 01:45:03,883
(Juliet) Romeo? Romeo?

2049
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:06,679
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

2050
01:45:10,373 --> 01:45:12,754
(Romeo) Goodnight,
a thousand times.

2051
01:45:12,823 --> 01:45:15,861
(Juliet) Goodnight a thousand,
thousand times, fair Romeo.

2052
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:17,828
(traffic murmuring)

2053
01:45:17,897 --> 01:45:20,141
(grunting)

2054
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:29,323
(sirens blaring)

2055
01:45:33,085 --> 01:45:37,848
(uplifting music)

2056
01:45:40,886 --> 01:45:42,588
(Lena) There's no way
I'm letting you drive.

2057
01:45:42,612 --> 01:45:43,475
(Devon) I'm gonna drive, okay.

2058
01:45:43,544 --> 01:45:44,717
(Lena) No, you're not.

2059
01:45:44,786 --> 01:45:46,346
(Devon) Yeah? Get
the keys from me then.

2060
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:48,133
(Lena) Vincent?

2061
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:51,586
Yeah, keep on stepping, skinny!

2062
01:45:54,934 --> 01:45:55,728
Come on, babe.

2063
01:45:55,797 --> 01:45:56,591
Babe, come on.

2064
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,799
Babe!

2065
01:45:57,868 --> 01:45:58,868
(Lena) I wanna drive.

2066
01:45:58,904 --> 01:46:00,492
No, why?

2067
01:46:00,561 --> 01:46:03,805
What are you stopping
for, let's go, come on.

2068
01:46:03,874 --> 01:46:07,050
(ominous music)

2069
01:46:08,051 --> 01:46:09,984
(couple arguing)

2070
01:46:10,053 --> 01:46:11,261
So this is what you call love?

2071
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,550
(Devon) The point still stands.

2072
01:46:13,574 --> 01:46:14,437
(Lena) I just
want us to be safe.

2073
01:46:14,506 --> 01:46:15,092
(Devon) We'll be fine, okay.

2074
01:46:15,161 --> 01:46:16,024
We will be fine.

2075
01:46:16,093 --> 01:46:17,336
(Scott) Babe, let's go!

2076
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:20,073
(Devon) My dad lost
his legs because my mom...

2077
01:46:20,097 --> 01:46:21,316
(Lena) The problem
is that you're drunk

2078
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,962
and I don't want you
to drive the car!

2079
01:46:24,585 --> 01:46:27,588
(Hardy) It means to plant
trees under whose shade

2080
01:46:27,657 --> 01:46:28,934
you don't expect to sit.

2081
01:46:29,003 --> 01:46:30,187
(Vince Voiceover)
Love is a verb.

2082
01:46:30,211 --> 01:46:31,571
(Einstein) The
most powerful force,

2083
01:46:31,626 --> 01:46:33,328
because it has no limit.
(Devon) Stay away from Lena!

2084
01:46:33,352 --> 01:46:34,536
(Olivia) The total commitment to

2085
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,675
the spiritual growth
of another person.

2086
01:46:35,699 --> 01:46:37,149
(Vince) Love the feeling.

2087
01:46:37,218 --> 01:46:39,945
(murmuring)

2088
01:46:40,014 --> 01:46:41,256
(Leon) Increase the dose.

2089
01:46:41,325 --> 01:46:42,499
(Hardy) A divorce follows.

2090
01:46:42,568 --> 01:46:43,808
(Devon) I told you to stay away!

2091
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:46,192
(Leon) Let Him in.

2092
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,508
(dramatic music)

2093
01:46:51,577 --> 01:46:52,577
Devon!

2094
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:56,582
She doesn't want to go.

2095
01:46:56,651 --> 01:46:58,929
I told you to stay
out of my business.

2096
01:46:58,998 --> 01:47:02,588
Who I choose to care
for is not your business.

2097
01:47:02,657 --> 01:47:04,176
Lena, do you wanna go with him?

2098
01:47:05,315 --> 01:47:07,766
Yeah, but I wanna drive, Devon.

2099
01:47:09,215 --> 01:47:11,079
Are you gonna keep
ignoring your fiance?

2100
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:16,706
(smacking)

2101
01:47:16,775 --> 01:47:18,190
Devon!

2102
01:47:18,259 --> 01:47:19,018
(grunting)

2103
01:47:19,087 --> 01:47:19,881
Devon!

2104
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:21,055
Mom, it's his battle.

2105
01:47:21,124 --> 01:47:22,056
Dad, wait.

2106
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:23,678
Stay down, final warning!

2107
01:47:24,679 --> 01:47:26,854
(coughing)

2108
01:47:26,923 --> 01:47:28,131
Devon, stop.

2109
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,201
Excuse me?

2110
01:47:30,927 --> 01:47:33,170
(groaning)

2111
01:47:33,239 --> 01:47:34,965
I won't let another sister die.

2112
01:47:36,346 --> 01:47:38,831
(light music)

2113
01:47:43,077 --> 01:47:47,219
Look, I don't know what you've
dealt with in your life.

2114
01:47:47,288 --> 01:47:49,428
I don't know what
baggage you have.

2115
01:47:49,497 --> 01:47:51,568
But whatever it is, let it out.

2116
01:47:52,776 --> 01:47:54,640
Let it out now,
let it out on me.

2117
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:58,057
Because if you lay
ONE FINGER! on her

2118
01:47:58,126 --> 01:47:59,645
at any point in your life,

2119
01:48:00,819 --> 01:48:04,512
I'll see to it that you
never see her again.

2120
01:48:04,581 --> 01:48:06,687
Every society fails when

2121
01:48:06,756 --> 01:48:08,861
its protectors
become its predators.

2122
01:48:10,898 --> 01:48:13,763
Learn what love is before
claiming to love Lena.

2123
01:48:15,592 --> 01:48:17,387
(light music)

2124
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:24,049
(distant sirens blaring)

2125
01:48:32,367 --> 01:48:33,507
I'm sorry, Vince.

2126
01:48:34,577 --> 01:48:37,338
(woman's breath)

2127
01:48:40,859 --> 01:48:41,859
Hurry.

2128
01:48:44,276 --> 01:48:46,002
(uplifting music)

2129
01:48:46,071 --> 01:48:47,141
Vincent!

2130
01:48:49,315 --> 01:48:50,315
He'll be back.

2131
01:48:51,801 --> 01:48:55,045
(uplifting music)

2132
01:48:55,114 --> 01:48:56,495
(Romeo) Dear Juliet.

2133
01:48:58,186 --> 01:49:00,637
Why are thou yet so fair?

2134
01:49:00,706 --> 01:49:04,261
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous?

2135
01:49:05,469 --> 01:49:07,092
And that the lean,
abhorred monster

2136
01:49:07,161 --> 01:49:09,991
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

2137
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:15,341
For fear of that, I
will stay with thee.

2138
01:49:17,792 --> 01:49:20,761
And never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

2139
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:22,970
Here, here will I remain.

2140
01:49:24,212 --> 01:49:26,939
With worms that are
thy chambermaids.

2141
01:49:27,008 --> 01:49:29,977
Here will I setup
my everlasting rest

2142
01:49:30,046 --> 01:49:32,911
and shake the yoke of
inauspicious stars!

2143
01:49:34,153 --> 01:49:36,121
Arms take your last embrace.

2144
01:49:39,849 --> 01:49:42,714
And lips, O you.

2145
01:49:42,783 --> 01:49:45,648
The doors of breath, seal
with a righteous kiss.

2146
01:49:45,717 --> 01:49:48,236
A dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

2147
01:49:48,305 --> 01:49:51,895
Come, bitter conduct.

2148
01:49:51,964 --> 01:49:54,139
Come unsavory guide.

2149
01:49:54,208 --> 01:49:57,004
Thou desperate pilot,
now at once run

2150
01:49:57,073 --> 01:49:59,731
on the dashing rocks
thy sea-sick weary bark!

2151
01:50:01,664 --> 01:50:02,699
Here's to my love.

2152
01:50:05,771 --> 01:50:08,532
(light music)

2153
01:50:15,091 --> 01:50:16,610
O, true apothecary.

2154
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,715
Thy drugs are quick.

2155
01:50:18,784 --> 01:50:19,784
Does he feel guilt?

2156
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:22,719
Pain?

2157
01:50:22,788 --> 01:50:24,134
Abandonment?

2158
01:50:27,448 --> 01:50:30,762
He doesn't die for her but
just to escape his own pain.

2159
01:50:32,211 --> 01:50:33,454
And is that love?

2160
01:50:35,249 --> 01:50:38,735
Or is it to still live and
to carry on her memory?

2161
01:50:40,495 --> 01:50:42,946
Love isn't something
that you find.

2162
01:50:43,982 --> 01:50:45,535
It's something that you choose.

2163
01:50:46,985 --> 01:50:50,644
And when you choose
it, love will find you.

2164
01:50:53,267 --> 01:50:54,406
Front and center.

2165
01:50:56,028 --> 01:50:58,790
(uplifting music)

2166
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:16,221
(clicking)

2167
01:51:17,153 --> 01:51:18,153
(sighing)

2168
01:51:19,327 --> 01:51:21,951
(uplifting music)

2169
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:26,920
(sighs)

2170
01:51:32,651 --> 01:51:33,825
Vincent?

2171
01:51:33,894 --> 01:51:35,550
Your mom's name
is Roxanne Stilwell.

2172
01:51:35,619 --> 01:51:36,966
What?

2173
01:51:37,035 --> 01:51:38,864
And she's looking for you.

2174
01:51:40,107 --> 01:51:42,592
(light music)

2175
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:54,259
Valentina, I apologize
a thousand times

2176
01:51:55,605 --> 01:51:56,848
for the way I've treated you.

2177
01:51:58,435 --> 01:51:59,436
I should have listened.

2178
01:52:01,956 --> 01:52:04,131
Thus with a kiss,

2179
01:52:06,754 --> 01:52:07,754
I die!

2180
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:11,621
(light music)

2181
01:52:17,282 --> 01:52:18,870
What's here?

2182
01:52:18,939 --> 01:52:22,597
A cup closed in my
true love's hand.

2183
01:52:24,979 --> 01:52:28,949
(uplifting, climatic music)

2184
01:52:29,018 --> 01:52:33,505
I don't want our
story to end in tragedy.

2185
01:52:33,574 --> 01:52:36,508
And left no friendly
drop to help me after?

2186
01:52:37,509 --> 01:52:40,339
(uplifting music)

2187
01:52:48,347 --> 01:52:49,347
(Juliet) O happy dagger,

2188
01:52:50,384 --> 01:52:52,662
this is thy sheath.

2189
01:52:54,215 --> 01:52:57,011
(uplifting music)

2190
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:07,401
There rest and let me die.

2191
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:09,921
(grunting)

2192
01:53:11,715 --> 01:53:13,062
Neither do I.

2193
01:53:21,691 --> 01:53:24,867
(patrons murmuring)

2194
01:53:24,936 --> 01:53:26,351
(gagging)

2195
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:29,388
(patrons murmuring)

2196
01:53:33,392 --> 01:53:35,084
(screeching tires)

2197
01:53:36,257 --> 01:53:38,742
(light music)

2198
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,314
(Vincent) Whoever reads this.

2199
01:53:59,936 --> 01:54:01,455
I mean every word.

2200
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:05,700
I love you.

2201
01:54:05,769 --> 01:54:08,842
(uplifting music)

2202
01:54:08,911 --> 01:54:10,050
What do I mean by love?

2203
01:54:13,018 --> 01:54:14,018
That love is patient

2204
01:54:15,676 --> 01:54:17,195
and I will be patient with you.

2205
01:54:20,612 --> 01:54:21,612
Love is kind.

2206
01:54:25,686 --> 01:54:27,446
And kindness I'll give to you.

2207
01:54:34,798 --> 01:54:36,179
Love does not envy.

2208
01:54:42,427 --> 01:54:43,704
It does not boast.

2209
01:54:45,844 --> 01:54:48,329
(uplifting music)

2210
01:54:53,438 --> 01:54:54,438
It is not proud.

2211
01:54:56,648 --> 01:54:58,995
I will surrender
my pride for you.

2212
01:55:05,105 --> 01:55:07,314
Love does not dishonor others.

2213
01:55:14,286 --> 01:55:15,701
It is not self seeking.

2214
01:55:16,737 --> 01:55:19,222
(uplifting music building)

2215
01:55:22,846 --> 01:55:24,538
It is not easily angered.

2216
01:55:25,642 --> 01:55:27,610
It keeps no record of wrongs.

2217
01:55:34,651 --> 01:55:37,102
Love does not delight in evil.

2218
01:55:41,037 --> 01:55:42,797
But rejoices with the truth.

2219
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:46,905
(uplifting music building)

2220
01:55:49,045 --> 01:55:51,427
Love always protects.

2221
01:55:56,225 --> 01:55:58,227
It always trusts.

2222
01:56:03,646 --> 01:56:06,925
And always hopes.

2223
01:56:10,791 --> 01:56:12,793
(climatic music)

2224
01:56:26,531 --> 01:56:28,429
Love always perseveres.

2225
01:56:31,087 --> 01:56:32,087
Charity?

2226
01:56:33,469 --> 01:56:35,954
(light music)

2227
01:56:37,611 --> 01:56:40,027
(whimpering)

2228
01:56:46,585 --> 01:56:48,829
(giggling)

2229
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:58,321
(splashing)

2230
01:57:00,358 --> 01:57:02,843
(light music)

2231
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:25,037
And love...

2232
01:57:26,798 --> 01:57:27,798
never...

2233
01:57:30,112 --> 01:57:31,044
fails.

2234
01:57:31,113 --> 01:57:33,943
(uplifting, climatic music)

2235
01:57:42,572 --> 01:57:43,572
Together.

2236
01:57:44,954 --> 01:57:47,819
(uplifting music)

2237
01:58:23,026 --> 01:58:25,581
(light music)
