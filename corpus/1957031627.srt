00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:04,028

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:06,990
( dramatic music plays )

3
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:28,803
( grunting )

4
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:38,647
( music continues )

5
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:45,696
( thudding )

6
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:52,119
MAN: Hey, kid, this is Jed.

7
00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:54,246
Listen, we just got the go-ahead

8
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,081
for you to go over to San Quentin today.

9
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,001
Now, the warden says you've got five minutes for your first visit,

10
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,754
so get in there and make an impression.

11
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:03,464
I mean, you're the expert on this guy,

12
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,050
and if anybody can pull this off, it's you.

13
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:09,553
This is our Hail Mary. Make it count.

14
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,180
Keep me posted.

15
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:12,264
( buzzer sounds )

16
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:20,314
( voices echoing )

17
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:21,857
WOMAN: Most of the women have been raped.

18
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,025
MAN: Terrorizing Los Angeles and Orange Counties,

19
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:25,361
and the city of San Francisco.

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,280
WOMAN: You know, the nature of these attacks, with seemingly no motive.

21
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:31,033
MAN: The so-called Night Stalker. He's the sadistic killer

22
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:32,952
wanted for a series of murders...

23
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,995
WOMAN: The killer entered through an unlocked window

24
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,957
in the predawn hours, and attacked the couple as they slept.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
MAN: 25-year-old Richard Ramirez

26
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,919
is now in custody in Central Jail.

27
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:45,381
RAMIREZ: We are all evil in some form or another,

28
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,800
are we not?

29
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:50,845
( buzzer sounds )

30
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:57,477
( buzzer sounds )

31
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,645
( locks click )

32
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,911
Hello, Richard.
I'm Kit.

33
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,166
That for Katherine?

34
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:23,378
Yeah.

35
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,171
Mind if I record this?

36
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,054
It depends
what we talk about.

37
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,605
I used to live
in Glassell Park.

38
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:44,608
Oh, yeah?

39
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,445
What street?

40
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:51,364
Verdugo.

41
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,199
Off Eagle Rock.

42
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:56,536
Good memory.

43
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,832
No new memories in here
to replace the old.

44
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:05,963
( coughing )

45
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:09,258
( coughing )

46
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:19,769
Are you sick?

47
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:23,939
Always.

48
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:25,816
( clears throat )

49
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:30,112
You're a lawyer,
right?

50
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,365
How old are you?

51
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,574
Forty-three.

52
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,786
I like your legs.

53
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:45,503
Maybe lift your skirt up
so I can get a better look?

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,675
That's not why I'm here.

55
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:56,889
Oh, yeah?

56
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,850
Then why are you here
dressed like that?

57
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:01,519
I'm interested in you.

58
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:07,108
"Interested"
like I'm a zoo animal
you want to study,

59
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,070
or like a zoo animal
you want to get bent
over a table by?

60
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:16,283
"Interested" like...

61
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,537
I want to understand you.

62
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,919
You see those other women
out there waiting,

63
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:28,463
waiting to see me?

64
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,299
They want to
understand me.

65
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:33,844
They don't.

66
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,680
You won't either.

67
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:40,475
At least they give me
something I can use.

68
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,352
So those women that
come here to visit you

69
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:45,439
are attracted to you?

70
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,941
Is that so hard
to believe?

71
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,234
Yes, actually.

72
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:54,281
You gonna
insult me now?

73
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:57,576
I mean, given
your history with women.

74
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,581
Alleged history.

75
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,791
( sighs )

76
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,129
Some women
like that...

77
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,089
my alleged history.

78
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:19,931
So, what are you
gonna give me?

79
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,560
What do you need?

80
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:27,981
To talk without this.

81
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:36,908
I've been here
23 years.

82
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:39,202
Solitary for 10.

83
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,372
The only people I ever get
to smell are the guards,

84
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,583
and they don't smell
so good, you know?

85
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,215
I never get to touch
anyone.

86
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,928
You're not gonna get to
touch me either, Richard.

87
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,846
We'll see about that.

88
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,142
GUARD:
Time's up.

89
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,487
You come back here,
don't wear that.

90
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,531
Gold is the metal
of Christianity.

91
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:19,075
It's not permitted
in my presence.

92
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:35,383
See you later, Katherine!
( locks click )

93
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:37,718
Maybe we can
shake hands next time.

94
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,140
( buzzer sounds )

95
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,227
( locks click )

96
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:07,124
( over phone ) Jed here.
KIT: Well, I met him.

97
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,918
And? And it's gonna be a process.

98
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,212
I need to gain
his trust,

99
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,214
build a relationship.

100
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:16,258
Everybody's got something
that makes them open up.

101
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,761
Just got to find what.
It's just gonna take time.

102
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,598
Well, you've got four days to
come up with that confession

103
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,850
if we have any chance at a stay.

104
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:28,228
I mean, you know, we're up
against it here.

105
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,897
How's Johnson
holding up?

106
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,567
He is questioning me nonstop
about your progress.

107
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:35,152
Yeah, no pressure.

108
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,862
All I'm saying
is that the Johnson family

109
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:39,156
doesn't have money
for a wild-goose chase.

110
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,908
The firm doesn't either.

111
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,036
Now, you came to us
with this theory
on Ramirez.

112
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,913
You convinced us,
we flew you out there

113
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:49,499
to get a confession
that you assured us
you could get.

114
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:52,836
This is gonna come down to you.

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,964
I mean, we got an innocent man
about to die here in Texas.

116
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:01,178
( chattering )
You there?

117
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,765
Yeah.
I gotta go.

118
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,520

119
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,341

Hey, Mom.

123
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:49,121
Yeah, I can't find
the Rosaries.

124
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:53,125
You don't have a Rosary.
There's not a Rosary
in the house.

125
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,669
No, I know
we had one.

of the so-called
Night Stalker.

130

He's the sadistic
killer wanted

131
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
for a series
of murders and rapes.

132
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,822
WOMAN ON TV:
Has struck again,
leaving two more people...

MAN: Hey, Kit.

134
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,242
Mom didn't say
you were coming tonight.

135

Well, guess what...
I am.

136
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,500
How can you be
wearing a jacket?

137
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,585
Well,

138
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,797
you gotta look cool
when it's this hot.
...her throat cut.

139
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,051
This is expected
to be connected to
a wide-ranging series
of brutal attacks...

140
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,969
What a sicko.
Nobody needs to see that.

141
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,931
No, leave it.
...continue to search
for any clues

142
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,974
that will lead to
the capture of this man

143
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:52,560
who some call
evil incarnate.

144
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,395
More on this story

You up for a movie?
No.

146
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:02,278
Tired.

147
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:03,738
All right, then.

It's... It's in the...
It's in the dresser,

151
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,608

( whimpering )

154
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,699
You'd better not be
lying to me.

155
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,868
( exclaims )
Swear on Satan.

156
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:52,163
Swear on Satan!

I swear on Satan!

157

WOMAN ON RADIO:
Referred to
as the Valley Intruder

168
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,253
and the Walk-in Killer.

169
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,756
Police have
found evidence
linking him

170
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,258
to several murders,
rapes and assaults,

171
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,344
dating back
over a year.

172
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,638
He is said to be
a tall, thin,

173
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,389
Mexican-American man

Morning.
Good morning.
You hungry?

177
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:24,047
Did you hear about that guy
that's been raping
and killing people?

178
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,799
It's all they're
talking about
on the news.

179
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:27,717
Not over breakfast, Kit.

180
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,511
The Night Stalker.

181
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:31,930
I thought they
were calling him
the Valley Intruder.

182
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:34,766
You talking
about that creeper?
Hi, baby.

183
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,228
Look, I'm about to go
to sleep, so let's not
talk about murder, okay?

184
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,605
No problem.
( kisses )

185
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,941
Hi. Get your fingers
out of there.

186
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:46,945
Use a fork, piggy.

187
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:49,656
Oh, it was so hot.
Couldn't sleep
at all last night.

188
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,741
Really?
Are you tired?

189
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:54,369
Mm-hmm.
( kisses )
I missed you.

190
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,413
MAN:
I missed you, too.

191
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:07,632
( both laughing )

192
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:12,887
You're not hungry?
No.

193
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:13,638
( door shuts )

194
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,236
The prisoner
will arrive soon.

195
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:34,076
Don't worry, ma'am.
He's basically harmless
nowadays.

196
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,079
The cancer makes him
pretty weak.
Cancer?

197
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,873
Yeah.

198
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,167
My wife's sister
had the same thing:

199
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,669
lymphoma.

200
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:46,464
It just does what
it wants to do with you,
and then one day,

201
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:47,882
that's it.

202
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:51,552
Anyway, I'll be
right behind you
the whole time.

203
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:53,346
Just do what
you need to do.

204
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:09,904
( sniffing )

205
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,741
You smell like
hotel soap.

206
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,471
( door shuts )

207
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:41,895
I saw your admirers
as I was leaving
yesterday.

208
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:51,905
Guards call them
my groupies.

209
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,157
One of them
was your wife,
Doreen, right?

210
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,210
How did you meet?

211
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,674
( clears throat )

212
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:15,178
She'd come to my trial.
She wrote for the papers,

213
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:18,890
and she'd write
articles about

214
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,268
how messed up
the whole thing was,

215
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,853
how I'd never get
a fair shake because
my picture

216
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:25,439
was on every channel
saying I did it.

217
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,065
Hmm.

218
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:29,776
She always believed
I was innocent.

219
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,238
Were you?
I don't believe
in innocence.

220
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,950
I think Satan was
always inside me.

221
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:42,164
Tell me what
you were like
as a child.

222
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:45,209
Satan is a stabilizing
force in my life.

223
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,462
Satanists need to have
more faith than Christians,

224
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,755
because Christ was
seen and felt.

225
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,884
Lucifer has never felt
the need to be seen,

226
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:57,221
but in everyone's soul,
he can be felt.

227
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,681
Well, if he can be felt
in everyone's soul,

228
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,600
then why doesn't everyone
believe in him?

229
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:01,893
Because people
don't want to know

230
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:05,188
what's truly
in their souls.

231
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:22,079
So I read when you were five,
you suffered a concussion.

MAN:
And now...

237
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:49,857
They say head trauma
is common among criminals.

238
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,734
I know.

239
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,444
I read all those
same books too, lady.

240
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:57,282
Frontal lobe damage
can mess with your empathy,
increase aggression.

241
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,411
I'm impressed.
I'm not an idiot.

242
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,082
I didn't say
you were.

243
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,127
What else did you read about me
in your Night Stalker book?

244
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,713
I read that you spent
a lot of time with
your cousin, Mike.

245
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,885
Yeah.

246
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,721
I hung out
with Mike a lot.

247
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,515
He taught me
how to hunt,

248
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,476
to sneak up
on an animal
with stealth,

249
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,895
or to shoot or stab it
for the quickest death.

250
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,024
Where is that?
With a gun in the head,

251
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,568
right above the ear.

252
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,362
With a knife,
across the throat.

253
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,282
You drive the point
into the side of the neck,
and you pull it across.

254
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,036
Cuts both the windpipe
and the arteries.

255
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,917
Always lethal.

256
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,629
Guess that turned out to be
pretty useful knowledge.

257
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,389
There wasn't much going on
in El Paso back in those days.

258
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,100
( rock on radio )

259
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,020
We drove around,

260
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,313
listened to metal,

261
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,442
talked.

262
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,693
Now, look at
this one, Richie.

263
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,487
She's all by herself.

264
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,448
Yeah.

265
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,786
Hey, sexy.
You want a ride?

266
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,955
Hey, I know
I'm too old for you,
but my little cuz here,

267
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,876
he can show you
a good time.
Come on.

268
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,047
( chuckling )

269
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,424
You got to learn how
to talk to girls, homie.

270
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,344
You got to show them
who's boss, or...
( exclaims )

271
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,847
they'll have no respect,
believe me.

272
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,642
Hey, you want
to go back?

273
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,143
We'll get her in the car,
show her what's up?

274
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,521
Come on. I'll show you
a few tricks with her.

275
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,154
( chuckling )

276
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,156
Look at you,
all scared.

277
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,075
RAMIREZ: He just got back from 'Nam,

278
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,661
so he told me war stories,

279
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,162
showed me pictures from over there.

280
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,830
Hey, that's a good one
right there, man.

281
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,874
( chuckling )

282
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,793
KIT: What was in the pictures, exactly?

283
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,878
RAMIREZ: Trophies. Dead people.

284
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,922
Girls going down on him.

285
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:20,301
Like, with his gun at her head.

286
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,428
And then that same girl's head on the ground.

287
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,935
That's just a pretty
terrible image.

288
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,938
It's war.

289
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,316
Those things happen
here in polite society,
you get the death sentence.

290
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,694
They happen with the enemy,
you get a Medal of Honor.

291
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,864
Killing is killing,
whether done for profit,
duty, or fun.

292
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,830
Why do you do it,
Richard?

293
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,457
Profit, duty,
or fun?

294
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,565
I bet you like it rough,
don't you?

295
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,236
You like to get
forced, I bet.

296
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,156
You're so in control
out in the open,

297
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,701
but you like
to get controlled
when no one's watching.

298
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,287
( breathing heavily )

299
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,549
You remind me of...

300
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,594
what was her name?

301
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,848
Carol.

302
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:49,934
She was old too,
but I could tell
she liked it.

303
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,687
You know who she was,
Carol, I bet.

304
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:55,815
I'm surprised
you remember their names.

305
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,611
What did I tell you
about memories in here?

306
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:03,323
KIT: Carol Kyle, Burbank.

307
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:06,159
Wake up!
( gasps )

308
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:08,328
Rape and robbery.

309
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:12,290
Not bad.

310
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:16,127
You study me
pretty hard, don't you?

311
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:19,756
Why are you so interested?

312
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,094
You want to be controlled
by me, Katherine? Hmm?

313
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:28,306
You like to think because
you're so cleaned up
on the outside,

314
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,434
no one can see
how dirty you are
on the inside.

315
00:22:31,478 --> 00:22:33,978
But I see it.

316
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,773
I know what you
really want from me.

317
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:43,780
That's enough
for the day.

318
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,259
RAMIREZ:
Hey, Katherine.

319
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:06,971
I'll be thinking
about you tonight.

320
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:12,434
Your face in my mind,
just like mine's in yours.

321
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:14,395
We still have a lot
to talk about, you and I,

322
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:18,232
don't we?

323
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,715
They found another victim.
Mission Viejo.

324
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:45,217
I can't talk
about rape and murder
all day, every day.

325
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:50,180
Shot the guy but not the girl.
He only raped her.
Stop it, Kit.

326
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,266
My mom's here.
You want a ride?

327
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,518
Yeah.

328
00:23:57,273 --> 00:23:59,356
Bye.

329
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:06,363
Hey. Hey.

330
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:09,701
I think it's really smart
you're paying attention
to that stuff.

331
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,371
I'm, like, kind of
obsessed with it.

332
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:17,292
Ooh, that's
a bitchin' car.

333
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:19,711
Yeah, it's my mom's
boyfriend's car.

334
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:22,213
He's fixing it up.
Rad.

335
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:24,424
He must be
really cool.

336
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:26,927
( sighs )
He's all right.

337
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,511
KIT:
I was reading
in the newspaper

338
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:31,848
that he usually targets
yellow and beige houses.

339
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,558
BOY:
Well, that's good.
I live in a red house.

340
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,185
( Kit chuckles )

341
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:41,816
I don't have much yet.

342
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,155
They say he's handsome.
Ew!

343
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,783
I just thought it was
interesting that they'd
describe him that way

344
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:52,869
after what he did.

345
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:56,289
I guess his teeth are
pretty gnarly, though.

346
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,459
Why do you think he raped
those old ladies?

347
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:03,505
I don't know.
It's like, he's just
driven to do it.

348
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:05,507
Like,

349
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,884
animalistic.

350
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:42,503
( water running )

351
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:46,007
( faucet knobs turn off )

352
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:51,595
Mike's out job hunting.
Okay.

353
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:52,847
( sighs )
Richard, could you
turn that thing off?

354
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,390
Cause if Mike sees that,
he's gonna sit down,

355
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,392
and I'll never
get him back up.

356
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:58,519
( door opens )

357
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,021
Oh, hell, yeah.

358
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,107
Popeye? Nice!
( baby cries )

359
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:05,109
What up, little man?

360
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:15,494
Hey, any lady love
yet or what?
Maybe.

361
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:17,788
"Maybe"?
What, are you gonna be
all coy with me now?

362
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:20,207
( chuckles )

363
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:23,085
All right, well,
if you ever get there,
you let me know, man.

364
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:25,671
I got some good advice
for you in that department.

365
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:28,299
Do you really need to be
getting high with Richie
and watching cartoons?

366
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:30,342
Weren't you supposed to be
looking for work?

367
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:33,304
I did.
You've barely
been gone an hour.

368
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:37,016
Well, maybe I found
a job real quick.
You're useless.

369
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,392
What the hell
did you say?

370
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:42,272
You heard me,
you lazy piece of trash.

371
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:44,941
WOMAN:
Oh, God, are you serious?
( gasps )

372
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:46,902
( gunshot )

373
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:51,948
( baby cries )

374
00:26:58,457 --> 00:27:00,540
( chuckles )

375
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:12,135
( laughing )

376
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,659
( engine shuts off )

377
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:48,713
( door opens )

378
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,477
( dog barking )

379
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,942
( dog barking )

380
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:23,541
( engine starts )

381
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:47,398
You want to bail?

382
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:52,153
We're gonna stay
all night, remember?

383
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,529
Who says?

384
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:54,780
That's the game.

385
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:57,325
You want to wait around
for him, feel free.

386
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,452
I'm not the one
with the death wish.

387
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,456
It's okay.

388
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:07,293
That's more privacy
for us.

389
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,927
It's too hot.

390
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:34,655
Listen, I thought
we were having
a good time,

391
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:38,825
but I can
take you home now
if you want.

392
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:43,622
I don't want
to go home.

393
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:58,804
So how come?

394
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,770
So we'll stay,
okay?

395
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,336
( groans )

396
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,800
( groans )

397
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:02,577
Hey, kid, it's Jed.

398
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,414
Uh, listen, I know
this is basically

399
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,958
an impossible
mission you're on.

400
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:11,252
Believe me,
I get that.

401
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:14,380
But we're all, uh,
hoping and praying
down here.

402
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:17,884
Don't let up.

403
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,489
So you came back.

404
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:41,241
I didn't get
what I came for yet.

405
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:53,504
I've never met
a girl like you.

406
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:58,926
Most come once
to see what it's like
to be so close to evil.

407
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:01,428
They're hobbyists.

408
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:04,765
They never come
back again.

409
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:10,771
Did you ever meet
a girl you respected?

410
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,691
You talk like I'm some
kind of woman hater.

411
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:21,990
I gave up on
love and happiness
a long time ago.

412
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:26,412
Until you walked in,
that is.

413
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,957
What made you
give up on it?

414
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:52,147
( phone rings )

415
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,149
WOMAN:
Hello?

416
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:57,235
Yeah, who's calling?

417
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,405
Richard.

418
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:06,619
( heavy metal plays
over headphones )

419
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:09,914
Mary?

420
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,461
RAMIREZ:
Yeah?

421
00:33:14,504 --> 00:33:16,963
Hey.

422
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:20,383
Yeah, uh, hang on.

423
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:24,929
I got it. Thanks.
She sounds
real cute, Richie.

424
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:29,934
Hey.

425
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:31,936
Hey.
Do you remember

426
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,564
seeing me
on the street earlier?

427
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:36,191
Yeah.

428
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:40,987
Well, I remember
seeing you, too.

429
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:45,074
Well, uh...

430
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:48,453
you want to meet me
someplace?

431
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,872
Now?

432
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:53,166
Sure.

433
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:55,877
Pretty late.

434
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:59,964
So... sneak out.

435
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:05,345
Where would you
want to meet?

436
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:08,265
Cemetery?

437
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:10,351
Well, that's creepy.

438
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:13,187
Why there?

439
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:15,481
It's quiet.

440
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:20,819
No one bothers
you there.

441
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:22,488
Okay.

442
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,114
Yeah?

443
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:25,741
Yeah.

444
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:28,744
I'll meet you there
in half an hour.

445
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:32,540
Cool.

446
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:37,044
Bye.

447
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:40,756
♪♪

448
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:46,656
Pretty brave to
hang out here
all by yourself.

449
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,117
It's just
dead people.

450
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:55,457
It doesn't
bother me.

451
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,961
Well, I'm not
as brave.

452
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:03,465
You'll have to
protect me.

453
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,273
( dog barking )

454
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,250
RAMIREZ: It took her for me to realize that

455
00:36:38,294 --> 00:36:42,713
I wasn't made right for that kind of thing.

456
00:36:42,757 --> 00:36:47,802
I couldn't walk with someone innocent like that.

457
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:59,939
She was a sucker for jewelry, though.

458
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:02,942
KIT: Did you start stealing to give her gifts?

459
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:07,113
RAMIREZ: I stole because I was good at it.

460
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:10,157
My brothers used to call me "dedos", fingers,

461
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:14,412
'cause I could lift anything.

462
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:42,606
People need to recognize

463
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,901
what they're good at naturally.

464
00:37:45,945 --> 00:37:47,737
There's a lot of misery caused in this world

465
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:51,992
by people who aren't true to their nature.

466
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:55,287
KIT: And what is your nature?

467
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,414
Evil.

468
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,717
What are you doing here
with me on death row

469
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:15,390
instead of being at home
with your husband and kids?

470
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:17,309
I don't know how it works
out there these days,

471
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:21,021
but the world I remember
required a little
give and take.

472
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:23,482
You expect me to give
you something without
giving me something.

473
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:26,777
That's stealing, Kit.
That's how I got in here.

474
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,905
That's not how
you got in here.

475
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:34,034
Well, it didn't help.

476
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,578
( wry chuckle )

477
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:41,291
What do you
want to know?

478
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:42,250
You married?

479
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:43,919
No.
Kids?

480
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:47,547
No.
How come?

481
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,551
Family never
interested me.

482
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,845
Yours messed up?

483
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:55,722
No.
What's the point
in lying to me?

484
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,350
What am I gonna do
with the truth in here?

485
00:38:58,393 --> 00:39:01,269
You play
like you understand,
but you don't.

486
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:03,271
You don't know
anything about me,

487
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:05,525
as smart as
you think you are.

488
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,277
Don't you ever just
want to get everything
that's up here out?

489
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:12,114
Just come clean?

490
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:14,325
Oh, I get it.

491
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,538
I see what's
happening here.

492
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,290
You're here to
save my soul.

493
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,000
Richard, I don't give
a damn about your soul.

494
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,836
You're like all
the other people
who used to come here

495
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:28,464
trying to make me repent,
but I don't repent.

496
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:31,008
I know Satan knows
what I've sacrificed,

497
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,094
and I know
I've got a place
in his kingdom.

498
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,472
So I don't need you
or anyone else to come
in here and save me.

499
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:38,391
What I need from you
is up your skirt.

500
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,977
( scoffs )
Don't you ever
get sick of that?

501
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:44,522
What?
Just saying things
to get a reaction.

502
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:46,983
Everybody's trying
to get a reaction.

503
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:50,111
Why else even deal
with people at all?

504
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,654
Some are trying to get
people to love them.

505
00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:53,489
Well, I could care less
about being loved,

506
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,700
so I might as well
try the opposite.

507
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:57,952
In the end, it doesn't matter
what you think of me.

508
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,453
I'm trying to give
you a chance

509
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,873
to set the record
straight.

510
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,666
What's out there
right now?

511
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,753
Speculation,
crime-scene photos,
victims' stories.

512
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:11,716
No one knows
your side of it.
Don't you want them to?

513
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:14,719
People don't want my side.
People love to get inside

514
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:18,180
of the mind of someone
that scares them.

515
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,225
There are whole industries

516
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:22,311
dedicated to it.

517
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:34,072
You're manipulating me.
You're trying to get
something from me.

518
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:37,034
No.
Lady, I still don't know
what you're looking for here,

519
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:39,494
but I'm done being
your little project.

520
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,163
Look.

521
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:46,835
I know you.

522
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:50,172
I've studied you.

523
00:40:50,257 --> 00:40:54,051
You did terrible things
in your life.

524
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:59,681
But you also had
terrible things
done to you.

525
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,808
I don't know if anybody
could've gone through
what you did

526
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,269
and come out
the other side.

527
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:08,565
I get it, Richard.

528
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:12,694
I just want to have
a real conversation.

529
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:15,614
( chuckling )

530
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:20,285
( laughing )

531
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:22,913
You're a lawyer.
Why would I tell you anything?
I still have appeals.

532
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:26,083
( chuckles )

533
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:29,586
You still think you have
a chance in hell of getting
out of this prison?

534
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:38,638
How dare you talk
to me like that?

535
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:43,351
Do you know what I'd do to you
if you talked to me like that

536
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:46,896
outside of these walls?

537
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,647
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

538
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:49,983
You have no idea.

539
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:56,406
No idea.

540
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,037
Get her the hell
out of here.

541
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:31,274
You're Doreen, right?
Yes.

542
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,486
Richard's wife?
Yes. And you are?

543
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,156
I've read...

544
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,199
I've read everything
you wrote about him...

545
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:42,326
the letters to the papers
during the trial.

546
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,872
You seem like
a sane person.

547
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:48,292
Why would you want
to be married
to that man?

548
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:51,295
Why would you spend
30 years waiting for him?

549
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,088
What kind of masochist
would you have to be

550
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:56,341
to waste your whole life
on someone that selfish?

551
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:03,265
You can say
whatever you want
to denigrate me,

552
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:06,101
but let me
tell you something.

553
00:43:06,145 --> 00:43:09,772
You look like
the loneliest person
in this room.

554
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:11,732
( stammers )

555
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:14,151
MAN:
Doreen Ramirez?

556
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:39,510
Hello!

557
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:42,221
Where are you going
looking so good?

558
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:31,604
( dance music plays, faint )

559
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:36,109
Slow night?

560
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:37,694
Yeah.
They're all slow.

561
00:44:37,737 --> 00:44:40,530
No one wants to go out
with that nutjob
running around.

562
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:42,824
What are you doing out
all by yourself?

563
00:44:42,868 --> 00:44:45,493
Just taking a walk.

564
00:44:45,537 --> 00:44:50,081
Why don't you come inside?
Let me call you a cab,
get you home safe.

565
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:54,294
( dance music plays )

566
00:45:09,853 --> 00:45:13,104
What do you
want to hear?

567
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:15,648
Do you have Pentagram?

568
00:45:18,446 --> 00:45:20,863
Hey, play
"Be Forewarned."
Pentagram.

569
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:28,370

( vibrates )

587
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:52,914
Hey, Jed. Look...

588
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,542
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: ...Correctional Facility is trying to contact you.

589
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:59,045
Do you accept
the call?

590
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:01,256
Yes.
One moment.

591
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,882
( beeping )

592
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:10,348
I can't figure you out,
Katherine.

593
00:47:20,652 --> 00:47:23,278
Are you there?

594
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,407
Kitty cat?

595
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:30,493
Kitty Katherine?

596
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:38,001
Uh...
( clears throat )

597
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:46,344
When I was a teenager...

598
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:53,559
I went to bed
every night

599
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:57,563
thinking you were going to
come in my room.

600
00:47:57,607 --> 00:48:00,691
So you're
another groupie.

601
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:06,238
When you got caught,

602
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:09,992
it was like something
was suddenly missing.

603
00:48:10,036 --> 00:48:13,079
I...

604
00:48:13,122 --> 00:48:17,124
started reading everything
about you I could find,

605
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:19,377
about the trial.

606
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,587
( sighs )

607
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:24,465
I started studying
killers.

608
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:28,636
I never thought
about crime before you.

609
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:32,973
You changed me.

610
00:48:38,189 --> 00:48:41,690
Man, I attract
all the crazy girls.
I'm like the crazy magnet.

611
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:45,277
Crazy glue.
( laughs )

612
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:50,074
I never even came
close to you, and...

613
00:48:50,118 --> 00:48:53,911
you affected
my whole life.

614
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:03,088
Richard,

615
00:49:03,132 --> 00:49:05,465
I want to come back.

616
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:10,178
I still think we have
things to talk about.

617
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:17,686
You need to lose
that recorder thing.

618
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:21,481
My phone?
Whatever it is.

619
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,237
Okay.

620
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:34,202
And we need to
ditch the guards too,
if I'm gonna really talk.

621
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:35,537
They do that
for lawyers.

622
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,716
Um...

623
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:51,636
Don't worry.

624
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,180
I'm still
all chained up.

625
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,475
I won't be able
to get to you.

626
00:49:56,518 --> 00:49:58,977
But you could get to me
if you wanted to.

627
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:06,234
But you need to start
telling the truth.

628
00:50:06,278 --> 00:50:08,195
I don't care if people
know who I am,

629
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,614
or why I did
what I did.

630
00:50:10,657 --> 00:50:14,410
I'm talking to you.

631
00:50:14,454 --> 00:50:16,496
I tell you the truth,
you tell me the truth.

632
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:19,874
That's how it works.

633
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,755
Okay.

634
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:27,798
Okay.

635
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:32,887
See you later, Katherine.

636
00:50:42,941 --> 00:50:45,608
( exhales sharply )

637
00:50:56,329 --> 00:51:00,998
( text tone sounds )
MAN:
Is that her?

638
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:04,460
Yep.
Well...

639
00:51:04,504 --> 00:51:05,962
She says she's getting
close, Harrison.

640
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,551
( chuckling )

641
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:17,139
Listen,
I know you don't have

642
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:19,016
a whole lot of faith.

643
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,103
I get that,
believe me.

644
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:25,356
But she still has
two more days.

645
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:42,666
( moaning )

646
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:13,697
( gasps )

647
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:27,377
RAMIREZ'S VOICE: Kitty cat?

648
00:52:27,421 --> 00:52:29,880
Kitty Katherine.

649
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:41,892
Wake up!

650
00:52:41,935 --> 00:52:44,437
( gasps )

651
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:51,235
( gasping )

652
00:53:30,193 --> 00:53:31,776
GUARD:
I'll be outside the door.

653
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,154
Just come knock or call out
if you need anything.

654
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,574
( door shuts )

655
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:50,670
Tell me why
you started killing.

656
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:57,218
( clears throat )

657
00:54:00,891 --> 00:54:04,560
I did a lot of drugs
when I was young.

658
00:54:04,603 --> 00:54:07,563
Prostitutes.

659
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:11,024
Hunted animals.

660
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:13,569
All those things
had their appeal, but...

661
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:20,284
killing was like
nothing else.

662
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:30,043
Its intensity can't be
described with words.

663
00:54:30,087 --> 00:54:32,755
To have that power
over life...

664
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:36,425
Take me through it,
the first time
you did it.

665
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:40,971
Why that person?
Why that night?

666
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:44,266
That old lady
in your neighborhood.

667
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,603
Not the first one
you were convicted of,
the first.

668
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:49,188
It was her.

669
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,282
Let's go back
to El Paso.

670
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:02,534
You started working
in that motel.

671
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:10,542
KIT: They gave you a passkey?

672
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:15,799
RAMIREZ: So we could let people in their rooms.

673
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:21,721
KIT: But you did more than that, right?

674
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:36,027
RAMIREZ: I'm surprised more people don't.

675
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,403
Half the time, they didn't even notice

676
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:40,406
anything was gone.

677
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,993
KIT: Seems like a good gig for you.

678
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:47,413
RAMIREZ: Yeah, that passkey came in handy a few times.

679
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,131
( gasps, screams )

680
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,053
Some husband came in
and beat the crap out of me.

681
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:04,597
They call the cops?
No.

682
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:06,808
They left town
without pressing charges.

683
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:07,976
What happened
to your passkey...

684
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:09,811
Let's talk about you
for a minute.

685
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:12,105
Oh.

686
00:56:12,148 --> 00:56:14,691
Remember?

687
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:17,068
You're real with me,
I'm real with you?

688
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:26,704
Go ahead.

689
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:28,998
So you're
a lawyer, right?
I am.

690
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:32,167
How did you go to school?
Glassell Park wasn't rich.

691
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:35,504
Believe me, I robbed
from those places.
They didn't have jack.

692
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:37,798
I worked my way
through school.

693
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:39,174
Where did you work?

694
00:56:39,218 --> 00:56:41,302
At a fetish club.

695
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,976
Now we're getting
somewhere.

696
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,937
Doing what?

697
00:56:51,981 --> 00:56:54,356
B.D.S.M. role play.

698
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,527
What the hell is that?

699
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,280
It can be
a lot of things.
You play the part

700
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:03,282
the client wants.

701
00:57:08,372 --> 00:57:10,873
You have sex with them?

702
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:15,836
No, never.

703
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:19,173
You make a lot of money?

704
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:21,717
Yes.

705
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:26,680
You ever still do it?

706
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:28,390
No.

707
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:38,651
I knew there was
something about you.

708
00:57:38,694 --> 00:57:40,027
Okay.
My turn again.

709
00:57:40,071 --> 00:57:43,323
I bet you used to
fantasize about me, huh?

710
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:46,701
Don't feel bad about it.

711
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:49,704
Sometimes we want things
that society shames us for.

712
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:51,873
Don't do that.
What?

713
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:54,250
Pair us off.
Compare our secrets.

714
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:56,044
It's a matter of degrees.

715
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:59,297
We are a product
of our times, and these
are bloodthirsty times.

716
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:03,718
That's a scripted answer.
I've read that before.

717
00:58:03,762 --> 00:58:07,138
You want a different answer,
ask a new question.

718
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:12,227
Okay. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

719
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:23,822
I'm here because
there's another man
on death row.

720
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:27,033
In Texas.
Harrison Johnson.

721
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:29,160
He's set to die for murders
I don't think he committed,

722
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:31,705
for murders I think
you committed.

723
00:58:34,918 --> 00:58:36,835
When?

724
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:40,005
January 1978.
A mother and a son.

725
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:41,881
Naoki and Yuko Kamori.

726
00:58:44,428 --> 00:58:47,929
What kind of names
are those?
Japanese.

727
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:50,181
Let me guess.

728
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:52,392
They were killed
at the motel
where I worked.

729
00:58:52,436 --> 00:58:54,352
Don't get all excited.

730
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,063
Do you think
I haven't been
paying attention?

731
00:58:56,107 --> 00:58:59,275
You just asked
me about the passkey.

732
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:00,818
Well?

733
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:13,372
So you came up here
to get me to cop to
some old murders in Texas?

734
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:17,835
So... Johnson
can get a stay.

735
00:59:17,879 --> 00:59:20,838
Because he's innocent?
You tell me.

736
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:25,259
( exhales sharply )

737
00:59:27,305 --> 00:59:29,138
He can't have been
in jail since '78.

738
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:30,931
Texas doesn't take
as long as California

739
00:59:30,975 --> 00:59:34,143
to kill off
their criminals.
He got arrested in '08.

740
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:37,313
So why do they think
he did these old murders?

741
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:39,106
He got picked up
a few times for vagrancy

742
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,567
and small crimes in El Paso
around the same time.

743
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,612
He hung around
the motel, I guess.

744
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:46,822
What did he look like?

745
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:50,284
Uh, back then
he was skinny.

746
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:51,827
Light-skinned
African American.

747
00:59:54,665 --> 00:59:58,042
Scar on his neck?
Yeah.

748
00:59:58,086 --> 01:00:00,795
I remember that guy.

749
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:02,963
He used to try to take
showers in the rooms,

750
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:05,382
steal coffee
from the lobby.

751
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:07,343
( coughing )

752
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,102
Well, he eventually
got arrested for
beating a guy in a bar

753
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:17,938
who turned out to be
related to a congressman.

754
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:20,690
The guy fell back
and hit his head
on a broken barstool.

755
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:22,400
He died
from the contusion.

756
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:25,445
The prosecutor
was a friend
of the congressman.

757
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:29,533
He dug up this cold case
and drew a connection.

758
01:00:29,576 --> 01:00:31,243
He wanted
the death penalty,
and he got it.

759
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:32,994
So he was beating
some guy in a bar?

760
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:35,455
Doesn't sound
so innocent to me.

761
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,332
They didn't have
enough evidence
to convict him.

762
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:39,334
He was just
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

763
01:00:40,879 --> 01:00:42,254
( sighs )

764
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:47,467
Do you ever worry
you're on the wrong side?

765
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:51,555
Am I on
the wrong side,
Richard?

766
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,561
You lawyers, you have to be
so sure about everything.

767
01:00:57,604 --> 01:00:59,437
You, with this.

768
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:01,731
You read some files
and made a decision...

769
01:01:01,775 --> 01:01:04,317
he's innocent...
for something that happened
so many years ago.

770
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,404
I mean I just don't see
how you can be so sure.

771
01:01:07,447 --> 01:01:10,407
The pieces of evidence
tell a story.

772
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:14,828
And when I read
that story,

773
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:16,913
it was awfully familiar.

774
01:01:37,937 --> 01:01:40,771
KIT: The son was stabbed.

775
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:43,566
The mother was cuffed, finger cuffs, and raped.

776
01:01:44,861 --> 01:01:47,028
And then, stabbed also.

777
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:52,283
The knife was driven
into the side
of the neck

778
01:01:52,327 --> 01:01:54,952
and then dragged
straight across,

779
01:01:54,996 --> 01:01:57,914
severing both
the windpipe
and the arteries.

780
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:05,796
Frankly, it reads like
a sloppier, less practiced
version of you.

781
01:02:05,882 --> 01:02:09,383
And you would know,
I guess.

782
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:11,427
Yeah.

783
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,241
It wasn't me.

784
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:41,875
I don't believe you.
I don't care
what you believe.

785
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,460
I know you want
your little theory
to be true,

786
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:44,628
you want to be
on the right side,

787
01:02:44,672 --> 01:02:45,963
but sometimes
you don't get to know

788
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:48,382
if you're on
the right side or not.

789
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:53,095
Uh...

790
01:02:58,435 --> 01:03:00,477
Do you think
you're evil,
Katherine?

791
01:03:03,065 --> 01:03:06,733
I think you are.

792
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:09,361
Everyone has good
and evil in them.

793
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:11,488
Personally, I'd like
to be 100% evil,

794
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:14,658
but I can't.

795
01:03:14,702 --> 01:03:17,077
I'm too easygoing
sometimes.

796
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:23,917
Everyone has
hate and anger.

797
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:27,546
Some people can
cope with it.

798
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:30,882
I can't.

799
01:03:30,926 --> 01:03:31,925
My hate and anger
grow to a level

800
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:36,138
that I can't live
comfortably with it.

801
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:39,016
When that happens,

802
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:41,018
I have to act on it.

803
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:48,150
Richard, did you act on it
in the motel in 1978?

804
01:03:53,073 --> 01:03:56,826
What do you do
with your hate and anger?

805
01:03:58,246 --> 01:04:01,456
Did you ever want
to act on it?

806
01:04:01,499 --> 01:04:04,292
To kill someone?

807
01:04:10,008 --> 01:04:14,469
This is the problem
with you.

808
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:17,472
I don't care about you.

809
01:04:17,515 --> 01:04:20,975
You give me
no reason to.

810
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:24,145
And I bet you don't give
anyone else a reason either.

811
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:29,484
Maybe that's why
you're all alone.

812
01:04:29,527 --> 01:04:34,030
Maybe it has nothing
to do with choice.

813
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:36,449
Maybe you spend
so much of your life
hiding who you really are

814
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:39,577

being no one.

Hello?
JED: Kit, damn it, I've been
calling you all morning.

884
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,702
Jed?
My phone is dead.

885
01:11:30,746 --> 01:11:32,829
Ramirez is
in the hospital.

886
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:35,457
The warden called me
when he couldn't reach you.
Where?

887
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:37,959
Tell me you got
something, Kit.
I can't tell you that.

888
01:11:38,045 --> 01:11:40,003
What is happening
out there?
I'll call you back.

GUARD:
I heard you were coming.
Hey, Charlie. What happened?

890
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:51,807
He had an episode
last night.

891
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,768
Bashed his head
pretty hard
on his cell door.

892
01:11:54,812 --> 01:11:57,270
Is he conscious?

893
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:58,772
In and out.

894
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,690
Want me in there
with you?

895
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:02,734
No, I'm all right.

( monitor beeping )

898
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:19,626
And you said
I'd never get out.

899
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:26,508
Pretty extreme way
to get a change
of scenery.

900
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:28,176
I got to admit,
I'm surprised.

901
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,763
You seemed fine
yesterday.

902
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,183
I never thought
it made much sense

903
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:39,814
to show off
your weaknesses.

904
01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:41,232
( coughing )

( machine warbling )

906
01:13:05,258 --> 01:13:07,925
Okay, Richard.

907
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:14,098
You said if you were
gonna tell me the truth,

908
01:13:14,142 --> 01:13:17,518
then I need to
tell you the truth.

909
01:13:17,562 --> 01:13:20,605
So here it goes.

910
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:28,279
Your...

911
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:32,533
sexual impulses were

912
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:37,330
formed when your cousin
showed you those
awful pictures.

913
01:13:41,586 --> 01:13:44,420
Mine were formed
when your acts, your...

914
01:13:47,884 --> 01:13:49,592
your face

915
01:13:49,636 --> 01:13:53,180
were all over
the news.

916
01:13:53,223 --> 01:13:54,932
And I was scared, but...

917
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:02,731
somehow that became
part of it.

918
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,866
So...

919
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:19,706
while my mom's boyfriend

920
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:24,753
made me have sex
with him,

921
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:33,929
at first it felt
like I thought it was
supposed to feel.

922
01:14:35,057 --> 01:14:38,684
Scary and painful.

923
01:14:46,652 --> 01:14:48,777
I fantasized
about killing him.

924
01:14:54,034 --> 01:14:56,535
Pushing something into him
that he didn't want,

925
01:14:56,578 --> 01:14:58,662
over and over,

926
01:14:58,706 --> 01:15:01,665
something that would
hurt him.

927
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:03,125
( sighs )

928
01:15:03,168 --> 01:15:05,294
I thought about how you would
do it without hesitating,

929
01:15:05,338 --> 01:15:07,213
and you didn't even
have a reason.

930
01:15:08,758 --> 01:15:12,552
I... envied you.

931
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:25,815
So I stabbed him.

932
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,443
( groaning )

933
01:15:41,374 --> 01:15:44,625
God!
( groans )

934
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:57,930
He took his stuff, and he left.

935
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:01,476
And he never told my mom
about the stabbing.

936
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,317
And...

937
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,946
I never... told her
about the rape.

938
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:37,513
I never told anybody
about it.

939
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:51,193
( sniffles )

940
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,155
I used the passkey.

941
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:09,878
Can you say that
again, please?

942
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:18,470
I used the passkey,
like you said.

943
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:26,854
I killed
the Asian lady
and her kid,

944
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:29,857
with an eight-inch knife

945
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,526
that I got from my...

946
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:36,447
father's hunting kit.
( phone vibrates )

947
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:38,783
I used finger cuffs
that I'd gotten

948
01:17:38,827 --> 01:17:42,287
from the Army-Navy store.

949
01:17:51,047 --> 01:17:53,673
There's others too.

950
01:17:55,218 --> 01:17:59,137
Other...
Other victims?

951
01:17:59,222 --> 01:18:01,806
( phone vibrates )
( groans )

952
01:18:05,395 --> 01:18:10,106
Richard, will you
say your name
and today's date?

953
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:13,359
Richard Ramirez.

954
01:18:13,403 --> 01:18:15,069
It's...

955
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:19,616
June 7, 2013.

956
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:22,702
June 7, 2013.

957
01:18:22,746 --> 01:18:25,997
Is there...

958
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:29,375
anything you would know
that no one else would

959
01:18:29,419 --> 01:18:33,421
about the day,
about the victims?

( phone vibrates )

961
01:18:46,228 --> 01:18:49,855
The mother
was a bitch.

962
01:18:52,318 --> 01:18:56,570
She treated her kid
like crap.

963
01:18:56,614 --> 01:18:57,905
He was ...

964
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:01,700
Or deaf, maybe.

965
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,331

966
01:19:13,547 --> 01:19:15,756

968
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:36,360

the others.

( soft chuckle )

970
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:42,700
Some things are best kept
between me and Satan.

971
01:19:46,163 --> 01:19:47,830
I'm not recording
anymore, Richard.

972
01:19:47,873 --> 01:19:49,456

Don't go thinking

977
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:10,228
just because you told me
your sad little story

978
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:14,941
that you mean
something to me.

979
01:20:14,985 --> 01:20:18,403
I gave you a gift,

980
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:23,575
and I made your career...

981
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:27,620
your life.

982
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:31,291
That's the power
I hold.

983
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:45,597
You're not special
to me.

984
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,395
You're just
another nobody,

985
01:20:52,439 --> 01:20:55,982
and you don't deserve
my secrets.

1002
01:22:37,337 --> 01:22:39,713
Yeah. Listen, uh,

1003
01:22:39,756 --> 01:22:41,756
I had my doubts, I'm not gonna lie,

1004
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,301
but you really pulled this one out.

1005
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:48,680
Thanks, Jed.
So, when's your flight back?

1006
01:22:48,724 --> 01:22:51,266
I think I'm gonna stay
out here a while,
go see my mom.

1007
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,518
Oh, that's right. You're from out there.

1008
01:22:53,562 --> 01:22:55,854
Well, get on
back here soon.

1009
01:22:56,023 --> 01:22:58,773
That confession you got
could be a very big deal.

1010
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:02,402
It's a national story, kid.

1011
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:04,529

KIT:
Hey, Mom.

1015
01:23:37,814 --> 01:23:39,481
Oh, my God, Kit.

1016
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:42,359
You startled me.
I wanted to surprise you.

1017
01:23:42,402 --> 01:23:46,405
Well, you did that.

1018
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:49,116
What was I looking for?

1019
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:59,669
Maybe we can close
the refrigerator
till you remember.

1020
01:23:59,712 --> 01:24:01,879
I wanted to start dinner.

1021
01:24:01,965 --> 01:24:04,173
I remember.

1022
01:24:04,217 --> 01:24:07,009
You want me to help?
No, I've got my routines.

1023
01:24:07,053 --> 01:24:09,262
I'll make you a plate.

1024
01:24:17,397 --> 01:24:20,731
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
put my stuff away.

1025
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:24,193
...took over Taksim Square. The demonstrations began in late May,

1026
01:24:24,237 --> 01:24:26,988
in protest of Government plants...

1027
01:24:27,031 --> 01:24:28,739
Need me to bring
anything in?

1028
01:24:28,825 --> 01:24:30,616
Oh, only if
you want a drink.

1029
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,034
I don't drink with
my dinner anymore.
It gives me indigestion.

1030
01:24:34,038 --> 01:24:38,040
Richard Ramirez, known to many as the Night Stalker, died today.

1031
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:41,627
Ramirez remained on San Quentin's death row for 23 years

1032
01:24:41,671 --> 01:24:45,423
awaiting execution until the time of his death earlier today.

1033
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:47,300
He was 53 years old.

1034
01:24:47,343 --> 01:24:49,051
After terrorizing Californians

1035
01:24:49,095 --> 01:24:51,095
with a slew of random and brutal slayings...

1036
01:24:51,222 --> 01:24:55,266
Oh, the horrible things
that man did.

1037
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:57,518
You remember, Kit?

1038
01:24:57,562 --> 01:24:58,894
It was the hottest summer
I can remember.

1039
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:01,523
And you couldn't open
your window without worrying

1040
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:05,444
whether you'd be letting
that maniac inside.

1041
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:07,654
over one of the hottest summers on record,

1042
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,990
in July and August of 1985,

1043
01:25:10,034 --> 01:25:11,658
air conditioner sales spiked...

1044
01:25:11,702 --> 01:25:13,869
Mom, why is that
picture still up?

1045
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:15,829
Ramirez was convicted of...

1046
01:25:15,873 --> 01:25:19,291
I don't know.
I don't like to just
throw things out, Kit.

1047
01:25:19,335 --> 01:25:21,168
11 counts of sexual assault...

1048
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:23,295
You should throw
that out.

1049
01:25:23,339 --> 01:25:25,422
You were a wild child
back then.

1050
01:25:25,466 --> 01:25:28,425
Always wanted to be out
roaming the streets.

1051
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:33,972
I just wanted you
here at home, where
I knew you'd be safe.
