1
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,380  X1:110 X2:603 Y1:421 Y2:452
It is said that over 1 50 years ago...

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,073  X1:122 X2:591 Y1:421 Y2:446
...in the town of Darkness Falls...

3
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,915  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:379 Y2:452
...Matilda Dickson
was adored by all the children.

4
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,158  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:379 Y2:452
Whenever one of them lost a tooth,
they would bring it to her...

5
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,854  X1:136 X2:577 Y1:421 Y2:452
...in exchange for a gold coin...

6
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:09,696  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:379 Y2:452
...earning her the name
''The Tooth Fairy. ''

7
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,430  X1:127 X2:585 Y1:421 Y2:446
But fate was not kind to Matilda.

8
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:20,340  X1:128 X2:585 Y1:379 Y2:452
One night, fire tore through
her home on Lighthouse Point...

9
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:24,313  X1:107 X2:605 Y1:421 Y2:452
...leaving her face horribly scarred.

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:31,550  X1:076 X2:639 Y1:379 Y2:452
Matilda's burned flesh was so sensitive
to light, she could only go out at night...

11
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,387  X1:091 X2:621 Y1:421 Y2:452
...always wearing a porcelain mask...

12
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,555  X1:183 X2:529 Y1:379 Y2:452
...so no one could
ever look upon her face.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,663  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:379 Y2:446
One day, two children
didn't come home.

14
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:49,901  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:379 Y2:452
The townspeople blamed Matilda.
They hanged her...

15
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:55,537  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:379 Y2:452
...tearing off her mask, exposing
her hideous face to the light.

16
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,877  X1:158 X2:553 Y1:421 Y2:452
And with her dying breath...

17
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,513  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:379 Y2:452
...Matilda laid a curse
upon Darkness Falls.

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,961  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:379 Y2:450
The next morning, the two children
were found, safe and sound.

19
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,828  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:379 Y2:452
The town buried their secret
along with Matilda's body.

20
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,935  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:379 Y2:446
Since then, there are some
who believe that Matilda visits...

21
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:27,808  X1:082 X2:630 Y1:379 Y2:452
...the children of Darkness Falls
on the night they lose their last tooth...

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,441  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:379 Y2:452
...seeking her vengeance on any
who lay their eyes upon her face...

23
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,281  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:421 Y2:452
...fulfilling her curse:

24
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,983  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:421 Y2:446
''What I took before in kindness...

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,597  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:421 Y2:452
...I will take forever in revenge. ''

26
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,407  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:379 Y2:452
You're going to ask Caitlin
to the dance tomorrow, right?

27
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:41,213  X1:174 X2:539 Y1:421 Y2:452
You'll do great. l love you.

28
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,396  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:421 Y2:452
Now, you get some sleep.

29
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,932  X1:275 X2:439 Y1:421 Y2:452
Good night.

30
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,022  X1:326 X2:388 Y1:421 Y2:446
Boo!

31
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,462  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:379 Y2:446
-That was stupid, Cat.
-Wuss.

32
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,434  X1:137 X2:575 Y1:379 Y2:452
You hear Amber said ''asshole''
to Miss Alison in third period?

33
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,402  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:421 Y2:452
She got detention for a week.

34
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,676  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:379 Y2:452
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

35
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,741  X1:316 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay.

36
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:19,217  X1:112 X2:600 Y1:379 Y2:452
A bunch of us are going swimming
at the quarry. You want to come?

37
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,586  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:421 Y2:452
No. l've gotta get up early for practice.

38
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,922  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:379 Y2:446
-l can't believe you still have this.
-Of course.

39
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,962  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Kindergarten, right?
-Right.

40
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,828  X1:185 X2:528 Y1:379 Y2:452
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

41
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,574  X1:198 X2:514 Y1:421 Y2:452
You're bleeding. Here.

42
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,303  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt's just my tooth.

43
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,278  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:379 Y2:446
-ls this the last one?
-Yeah.

44
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,816  X1:225 X2:488 Y1:421 Y2:452
This one's special.

45
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,888  X1:211 X2:502 Y1:421 Y2:452
Your last baby tooth.

46
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,052  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:421 Y2:452
Means you're not a baby anymore.

47
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,692  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay. Well, l gotta go.

48
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,960  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Cat?
-Yeah?

49
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,797  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:379 Y2:452
There's this school dance
on Saturday night...

50
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:21,078  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:379 Y2:452
...and it's, like, one of those
boy-girl dances.

51
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,139  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:421 Y2:452
And boys ask girls, so--

52
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,786  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:379 Y2:452
l already told my mom
you'd be by at 7.

53
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,081  X1:203 X2:510 Y1:421 Y2:446
And she can drive us.

54
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:45,866  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:379 Y2:452
-So Saturday at 7, right?
-Okay.

55
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:56,074  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:379 Y2:446
First time shouldn't taste like blood.
lt should be sweet.

56
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,955  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:379 Y2:452
Remember, when the tooth fairy
comes, don't peek.

57
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,004  X1:318 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle?

58
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,221  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l saw her. l saw her.
-Kyle! What are you talking about?

59
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,864  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:421 Y2:452
l peeked.

60
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,433  X1:241 X2:473 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle, look at me.

61
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:41,533  X1:093 X2:620 Y1:379 Y2:452
-There is no one in this house but us.
-You're wrong.

62
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,105  X1:259 X2:453 Y1:421 Y2:452
You're wrong.

63
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:50,578  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l'll go take a look. Okay, Kyle?
-You can't go. Please, Mom.

64
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,411  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:421 Y2:452
Please stay in the light, Mom.

65
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,587  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:379 Y2:452
Please stay in the light.
Please stay in the light.

66
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,193  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:379 Y2:452
Please stay in the light.
Oh, please, God.

67
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,141  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:379 Y2:452
See, Kyle?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

68
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,167  X1:319 X2:395 Y1:421 Y2:446
Mom.

69
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,218  X1:159 X2:554 Y1:379 Y2:446
There's no next of kin.
The state will look after him.

70
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,719  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Larry!
-Caitlin! What happened?

71
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,450  X1:201 X2:512 Y1:379 Y2:452
She was already dead
when we got here.

72
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:18,120  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:379 Y2:452
l heard he was having some
problems, but Jesus Christ.

73
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,789  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:379 Y2:452
Looks like his mom
put up a bit of a struggle.

74
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,867  X1:316 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay.

75
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,168  X1:318 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle?

76
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,074  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle, this is Dr. Jenkins.

77
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,808  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:421 Y2:452
l want you to go with her.

78
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:421 Y2:446
Caitlin?

79
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,687  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:421 Y2:446
Caitlin?

80
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,014  X1:302 X2:412 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Caitlin.
-Sorry.

81
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,827  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:025 Y2:098
As l was saying, noctiphobia
is very common among his age group.

82
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,799  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:379 Y2:452
Now, we've run one CAT scan
and two MRls at your behest...

83
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,632  X1:198 X2:515 Y1:379 Y2:452
...and the conclusions
all say the same thing.

84
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,775  X1:071 X2:642 Y1:421 Y2:452
There's nothing wrong with your brother.

85
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,039  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:379 Y2:446
My brother hasn't slept more
than 1 0 minutes at a time...

86
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,844  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:379 Y2:452
...for the last three weeks. You go tell
him there's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:18,012  X1:126 X2:587 Y1:379 Y2:452
We've run every test possible.
There's nothing more we can do.

88
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,189  X1:235 X2:479 Y1:421 Y2:452
What happened?

89
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,857  X1:083 X2:631 Y1:379 Y2:446
He was asleep. l just closed the blinds.
l didn't think that....

90
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:35,196  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:379 Y2:446
l saw her. l saw her.
lt can't be dark.

91
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,637  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt's okay, Michael.

92
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,915  X1:166 X2:546 Y1:379 Y2:452
l won't let them shut off
the lights, okay? l promise.

93
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:58,029  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt'll be okay.
lt's okay, Michael.

94
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,396  X1:311 X2:406 Y1:421 Y2:446
Hello?

95
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:15,871  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:379 Y2:446
Hi. ls this Kyle Walsh's number?
This is Caitlin Greene.

96
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,502  X1:239 X2:475 Y1:421 Y2:452
That's not funny.

97
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,043  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle. Hey, it's Cat.

98
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,443  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:379 Y2:446
You asked me to the dance
but never took me.

99
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:28,177  X1:200 X2:512 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Caitlin?
-Yeah. Hey, you are...

100
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,720  X1:206 X2:507 Y1:421 Y2:446
...hard to track down.

101
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,257  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:421 Y2:446
l know it's been forever.

102
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,555  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:379 Y2:452
l'm sorry. Where are my manners?
How are you?

103
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,862  X1:323 X2:392 Y1:421 Y2:446
Fine.

104
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,060  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:379 Y2:452
-What do you want?
-Right. Right.

105
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,400  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt's my brother, Michael.

106
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,607  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:421 Y2:452
He's in the hospital, and he....

107
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,479  X1:084 X2:630 Y1:379 Y2:446
He's really scaring me. He won't sleep,
not even 1 0 minutes at a time...

108
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,314  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:379 Y2:452
...and now he won't let us
shut off any of the lights.

109
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,754  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:379 Y2:452
Doctors say he has something
called noctiphobia or....

110
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,890  X1:265 X2:449 Y1:421 Y2:452
Night terrors.

111
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,021  X1:316 X2:399 Y1:421 Y2:452
Right.

112
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,564  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:379 Y2:452
l remembered that's what they
said you had when your--

113
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,827  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:421 Y2:452
When your mother was killed.

114
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:23,134  X1:119 X2:593 Y1:379 Y2:452
Anyway, l just thought maybe you
could tell me how you got over it.

115
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,446  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:421 Y2:446
l didn't.

116
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,171  X1:204 X2:509 Y1:421 Y2:446
You must be Michael.

117
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,339  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt's okay, man.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

118
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:39,848  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:379 Y2:452
l just wanna talk a little.
My name's Kyle.

119
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:45,122  X1:105 X2:608 Y1:379 Y2:452
Your sister says you're afraid
of the dark. Makes it tough to sleep.

120
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,586  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:421 Y2:452
You get a lot of sleep?

121
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,728  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:421 Y2:446
Me neither.

122
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,660  X1:175 X2:538 Y1:421 Y2:450
Well, this was a bad idea.

123
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:10,012  X1:093 X2:620 Y1:379 Y2:452
Caitlin says that when you grow up,
you're not afraid of the dark anymore.

124
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,456  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:379 Y2:446
-ls that true?
-Yes.

125
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,060  X1:288 X2:425 Y1:421 Y2:452
Why not?

126
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:29,224  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:379 Y2:452
Because you grow up and you realize
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

127
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,266  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:421 Y2:452
Then why are you still afraid?

128
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,602  X1:099 X2:614 Y1:421 Y2:450
Well, sometimes old habits die hard.

129
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:43,305  X1:094 X2:619 Y1:379 Y2:452
You wanna see something?
This flashlight, it's my peace of mind.

130
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,118  X1:162 X2:551 Y1:421 Y2:452
She won't come in the light.

131
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,297  X1:246 X2:468 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Who?
-You know who.

132
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:07,601  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:421 Y2:446
No. l don't know who.

133
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,037  X1:269 X2:444 Y1:421 Y2:452
Yes, you do.

134
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,339  X1:212 X2:500 Y1:421 Y2:446
You've seen her too.

135
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,083  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:379 Y2:452
Why would you say
something like that, Michael?

136
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,054  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:421 Y2:446
Because it's the truth.

137
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,964  X1:180 X2:532 Y1:379 Y2:452
Sometimes l think of
turning off all the lights...

138
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,498  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:421 Y2:452
...and letting her come and take me.

139
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:42,597  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:379 Y2:452
Sometimes l think that would be
easier than being so scared.

140
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,138  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:421 Y2:452
Did you ever think that?

141
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,250  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:421 Y2:452
She's gonna kill me, you know.

142
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:03,554  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:379 Y2:452
No one's gonna kill you, Michael.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

143
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,564  X1:200 X2:512 Y1:421 Y2:446
Your sister won't let it.

144
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,233  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:421 Y2:452
My sister can't stop her.

145
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,139  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:421 Y2:452
No one can stop her.

146
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,336  X1:318 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle?

147
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:28,749  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:379 Y2:446
-l can't believe you came.
-That makes two of us.

148
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,788  X1:320 X2:393 Y1:421 Y2:446
So....

149
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,426  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:379 Y2:452
-So, what do you think? ls he--?
-What do the doctors say?

150
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,762  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:379 Y2:450
That he's a kid, he's just afraid
of the dark, he's confused.

151
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,666  X1:107 X2:606 Y1:421 Y2:452
Growing up here will do that to you.

152
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,898  X1:297 X2:417 Y1:421 Y2:446
Listen....

153
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,841  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:421 Y2:452
l hate to ask you this, but...

154
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,380  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:379 Y2:452
...when your mother died,
what really happened to you?

155
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,252  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:421 Y2:450
Cat, it's--

156
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,021  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Because it seems like it's the same--
-No.

157
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,231  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:379 Y2:452
-But the things he says--
-They're just things.

158
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,602  X1:273 X2:441 Y1:421 Y2:446
But these....

159
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,718  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Kyle?
-Did Michael just lose a tooth?

160
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,847  X1:235 X2:477 Y1:421 Y2:450
Yes, his last one.

161
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,283  X1:316 X2:398 Y1:421 Y2:446
But....

162
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,395  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:379 Y2:452
Come on, Kyle. You don't
still believe that, do you?

163
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:49,591  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:379 Y2:452
l mean, we all grew up with it,
but it was just a story to scare us.

164
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,844  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:421 Y2:452
l'm sorry, Caitlin.

165
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,410  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:421 Y2:446
This was a mistake.

166
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,747  X1:198 X2:514 Y1:379 Y2:452
Look, will you just--?
Wait a minute, please.

167
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,583  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:379 Y2:452
l don't think l know how
to help Michael.

168
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,261  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:421 Y2:452
Hey, Catey.

169
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,491  X1:318 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle?

170
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,331  X1:317 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Larry.

171
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,103  X1:180 X2:532 Y1:421 Y2:446
You came. That's terrific.

172
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,299  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt's great to see you, buddy.
All right.

173
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,967  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:421 Y2:452
l came straight from work.

174
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:39,045  X1:186 X2:527 Y1:379 Y2:452
So is there any reason
for us to panic, or what?

175
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,509  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:421 Y2:450
No, no.

176
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:45,782  X1:095 X2:617 Y1:379 Y2:452
Good. Good.
Well, that's what l keep telling Catey.

177
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:49,916  X1:116 X2:597 Y1:379 Y2:452
We have some of the best doctors
in the state in this hospital.

178
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,360  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:379 Y2:452
How about l take you two guys
out to dinner tonight?

179
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,059  X1:141 X2:572 Y1:379 Y2:452
What do you say? We can
celebrate the prodigal's return.

180
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,569  X1:195 X2:518 Y1:379 Y2:452
l think l'm just gonna
stay here with Michael.

181
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,503  X1:184 X2:529 Y1:379 Y2:452
Okay. Yeah.
Well, good night, honey.

182
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,844  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:421 Y2:446
Caitlin?

183
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,348  X1:293 X2:421 Y1:421 Y2:452
l'm sorry.

184
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,880  X1:078 X2:635 Y1:421 Y2:452
Well, Kyle, what do you feel like doing?

185
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,854  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:379 Y2:452
l feel like l've been here
too long already.

186
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,427  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Wait. We could go to The lnn, right?
-l don't drink.

187
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,793  X1:166 X2:547 Y1:379 Y2:452
Come on, Kyle. l haven't
seen you in 1 2 years, man.

188
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,764  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:379 Y2:452
One drink's not gonna
kill anybody, right?

189
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,245  X1:253 X2:460 Y1:421 Y2:452
Where's Kyle?

190
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,472  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:421 Y2:446
He left.

191
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,051  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:421 Y2:452
ls he coming back?

192
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,949  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:421 Y2:446
l don't know.

193
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,171  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Walsh, what's going on, man?
-Relax, buddy.

194
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,610  X1:141 X2:572 Y1:379 Y2:452
You'll survive one drink, right?
Beer okay?

195
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,683  X1:276 X2:438 Y1:379 Y2:450
-Can't.
-Oh, Jesus.

196
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,790  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Long time no see, Walsh.
-Hey, Dave. Two drafts.

197
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:33,522  X1:146 X2:567 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Fleishman, who's your date?
-Remember Kyle? Thank you.

198
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:38,296  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Kyle, as in Kyle Walsh.
-That's right, Ray.

199
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,530  X1:196 X2:517 Y1:379 Y2:452
That's him in the flesh.
Thank you, Dave.

200
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,081  X1:117 X2:596 Y1:379 Y2:452
Where you going, man? Sit down.
l bought you a beer.

201
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,879  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:379 Y2:452
l figured you'd like this one.
lt's a light.

202
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,620  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:379 Y2:452
You should have told me
you were coming back.

203
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:05,195  X1:129 X2:584 Y1:379 Y2:446
-l didn't know you'd still be here.
-You left a lot of shit behind.

204
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:11,832  X1:084 X2:630 Y1:379 Y2:446
-What's wrong?
-That's the freak who killed his mother.

205
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,405  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:379 Y2:452
So come on, man.
What you been doing with yourself?

206
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:24,907  X1:121 X2:592 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l'm in the gaming industry.
-Larry Fleishman, attorney at law.

207
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,682  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:421 Y2:452
You're an attorney?

208
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,579  X1:112 X2:601 Y1:379 Y2:452
You stole more candy than anyone
in the history of stealing.

209
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,350  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:421 Y2:452
That's why l'm a defense attorney.

210
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:42,756  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:379 Y2:452
So come on, Kyle, give.
What are you really doing back here?

211
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,295  X1:311 X2:402 Y1:421 Y2:446
Jesus!

212
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,733  X1:101 X2:613 Y1:421 Y2:452
l came to see if l could help Michael.

213
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,207  X1:197 X2:516 Y1:379 Y2:452
You don't look like
you can help anybody.

214
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,712  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:379 Y2:452
Wanna tell me how you got over it?
You did get over it, right?

215
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,245  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:421 Y2:452
She's got a whole new life now.

216
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,577  X1:307 X2:406 Y1:421 Y2:446
Caitlin.

217
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,915  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:421 Y2:452
This whole thing with Mikey....

218
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,351  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:379 Y2:452
What the hell are you
doing back here, freak?

219
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,528  X1:151 X2:561 Y1:379 Y2:452
l thought they locked
you up for killing your mama.

220
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,901  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:421 Y2:452
l don't want any trouble, all right?

221
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,940  X1:185 X2:528 Y1:421 Y2:452
Oh, yeah? Well, trouble.

222
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,239  X1:073 X2:641 Y1:421 Y2:452
That's tough! Come on, you chickenshit.

223
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,646  X1:225 X2:488 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Hey, come on.
-Kick his ass, Ray.

224
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,445  X1:227 X2:487 Y1:421 Y2:452
You want a piece?

225
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,351  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:379 Y2:450
-Come on. Take a shot.
-Leave him alone, man.

226
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:45,189  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:379 Y2:452
Oh, yeah, keep walking.
You guys see that?

227
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,124  X1:300 X2:414 Y1:421 Y2:446
Eat this!

228
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,777  X1:333 X2:380 Y1:421 Y2:446
No!

229
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,402  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:421 Y2:452
Keep running, you freak!

230
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,576  X1:277 X2:437 Y1:421 Y2:452
l'll find you!

231
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:15,110  X1:131 X2:580 Y1:379 Y2:452
Walsh, l'm gonna kick your ass!
l'll find you.

232
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:22,121  X1:181 X2:532 Y1:379 Y2:452
These are my woods.
Nobody messes with me!

233
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,637  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:421 Y2:452
Larry! Larry!

234
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,140  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:379 Y2:452
There's no way they could
have come this far, Matty.

235
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,753  X1:190 X2:523 Y1:421 Y2:446
What the hell was that?

236
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:57,361  X1:235 X2:478 Y1:421 Y2:452
Ray! Kyle Walsh!

237
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,666  X1:103 X2:610 Y1:379 Y2:452
What are those guys doing? Batten,
get back there. Spread them out.

238
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,329  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:379 Y2:452
l'm just gonna stay right here
with you. Okay, Matt?

239
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,203  X1:094 X2:620 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay, now that came from over there.

240
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,412  X1:201 X2:512 Y1:379 Y2:452
-You wait there, Larry.
-You got it.

241
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,062  X1:286 X2:428 Y1:421 Y2:452
Hey, Matt.

242
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,239  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:446
Matt?

243
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:56,351  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:379 Y2:452
Hey, buddy, this.... This whole
splitting up thing's kind of stupid.

244
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,112  X1:325 X2:389 Y1:421 Y2:446
Shit.

245
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,515  X1:297 X2:416 Y1:421 Y2:450
Oh, shit.

246
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,161  X1:211 X2:501 Y1:379 Y2:452
You're a grown man,
completely safe.

247
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,093  X1:192 X2:520 Y1:379 Y2:452
You're a grown man.
You're completely safe.

248
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,694  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:421 Y2:446
Get him off! Get him off!

249
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,211  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:421 Y2:452
''Light will spell her doom and death.

250
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:34,715  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:379 Y2:452
Brightest flame engulfed her whole,
setting free her wicked soul.''

251
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,110  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:421 Y2:452
Hey, Cat.

252
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,207  X1:187 X2:526 Y1:421 Y2:452
What happened to you?

253
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,111  X1:213 X2:500 Y1:421 Y2:452
Coming-home party.

254
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,481  X1:205 X2:508 Y1:379 Y2:452
Come here. Sit down.
You're bleeding.

255
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,659  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:421 Y2:450
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

256
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:19,735  X1:157 X2:556 Y1:379 Y2:452
Okay, l need to try to get
this gravel out of your scalp.

257
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,743  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:421 Y2:452
So how did this happen?

258
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,746  X1:316 X2:397 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay.

259
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:37,581  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:379 Y2:452
How about telling me about the last 1 2
years of your life in 25 words or less?

260
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,416  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:421 Y2:446
l went to a foster home...

261
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,726  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:379 Y2:452
...and we moved out west
to Las Vegas...

262
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,564  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:379 Y2:452
...and now l work in a casino.
ls that 25 words yet?

263
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,330  X1:273 X2:441 Y1:421 Y2:452
Keep going.

264
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,032  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:421 Y2:452
Are you and Larry going out?

265
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,701  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Why do you ask?
-l don't know, l just--

266
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,738  X1:315 X2:399 Y1:421 Y2:446
Got it.

267
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,949  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:421 Y2:452
l don't know what l'm doing wrong.

268
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,819  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Don't give him any more tests.
-What?

269
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,228  X1:112 X2:601 Y1:421 Y2:452
They stuck me with every needle...

270
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,531  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:379 Y2:452
...gave me more Rorschachs than l
could count, and it didn't do a thing.

271
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,503  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:421 Y2:452
Don't let that happen to Michael.

272
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,267  X1:273 X2:441 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle Walsh.

273
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,341  X1:105 X2:607 Y1:421 Y2:452
You're gonna have to come with us.

274
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,291  X1:135 X2:577 Y1:379 Y2:446
You ever see anything like this,
Dad?

275
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,587  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:421 Y2:452
ln this town, you'd be surprised.

276
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,059  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:421 Y2:452
What's with all the flashlights?

277
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,104  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:379 Y2:450
-Are you afraid of the dark?
-Yes, sir.

278
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,304  X1:192 X2:521 Y1:379 Y2:452
lf you knew why,
you'd think l was crazy.

279
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,916  X1:291 X2:423 Y1:421 Y2:452
Klonopin.

280
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,047  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:421 Y2:446
Darvocet.

281
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,925  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:379 Y2:452
Shit, this one
l can't even pronounce.

282
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,729  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:379 Y2:452
Doc says half of these
are antipsychotics.

283
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:33,397  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:379 Y2:450
Now, l don't know much about
medicine, but it occurs to me...

284
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:39,407  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:379 Y2:452
...that if a man is taking antipsychotics,
he might have a tendency to become...

285
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,876  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:421 Y2:452
...well, psychotic.

286
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,211  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:421 Y2:452
Ray's dead.

287
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,378  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:421 Y2:446
He's dead?

288
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,452  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:379 Y2:446
l think you had something
to do with it.

289
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:56,582  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:421 Y2:446
l didn't kill him. l didn't do this.

290
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,729  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:421 Y2:450
No, it must have been....

291
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,794  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:421 Y2:446
l don't know.

292
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,060  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:379 Y2:446
He hasn't been the same
since his mom's murder.

293
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,033  X1:244 X2:470 Y1:421 Y2:446
He's not a killer.

294
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,402  X1:117 X2:596 Y1:379 Y2:452
How do you know?
You haven't seen him in 1 2 years.

295
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,671  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:421 Y2:452
Because l know. He's a good man.

296
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,714  X1:142 X2:571 Y1:379 Y2:452
-He's been a ward of the state.
-But he came to help Michael.

297
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,875  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:379 Y2:452
He was in a mental hospital
for nine years.

298
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,546  X1:146 X2:567 Y1:421 Y2:452
Caitlin, he's a dangerous guy.

299
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:31,828  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:379 Y2:452
l had a file sent over from State
Hospital about you. Ten feet long.

300
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:38,060  X1:075 X2:638 Y1:379 Y2:452
You spent a lot of time there. Major
disassociative syndrome, night terrors...

301
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,864  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:379 Y2:452
...sociopathic tendencies,
three suicide attempts.

302
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,100  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:421 Y2:446
l didn't do this.

303
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,472  X1:126 X2:587 Y1:421 Y2:452
You did it, Kyle. Don't turn away.

304
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,811  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:379 Y2:452
You killed your mother
and you killed Ray. Didn't you?

305
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,953  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:421 Y2:452
l need to call my lawyer.

306
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,766  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:379 Y2:450
-l don't believe this. l'm going.
-Caitlin, l'll be in touch.

307
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,363  X1:307 X2:406 Y1:421 Y2:446
Caitlin.

308
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,474  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:379 Y2:452
l have to get back to Michael
at the hospital.

309
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,669  X1:323 X2:391 Y1:421 Y2:446
Matt.

310
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,142  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:421 Y2:452
Keep working on your crap story.

311
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,076  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:421 Y2:452
Hope you got a good lawyer.

312
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,409  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:421 Y2:446
l can handle this.

313
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,644  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:421 Y2:446
l can handle this.

314
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,218  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:421 Y2:446
l can handle this.

315
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,732  X1:289 X2:425 Y1:421 Y2:446
Black cat.

316
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,066  X1:288 X2:425 Y1:421 Y2:452
Why not?

317
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,862  X1:298 X2:415 Y1:421 Y2:446
Michael!

318
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,271  X1:298 X2:415 Y1:421 Y2:446
Michael!

319
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,209  X1:127 X2:586 Y1:421 Y2:452
Michael, open the door! Michael!

320
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,974  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l'll call security.
-Michael? Can you hear me?

321
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,440  X1:296 X2:418 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt's okay.

322
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,611  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:379 Y2:452
-She's gonna get me.
-lt's okay.

323
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:23,851  X1:100 X2:612 Y1:379 Y2:452
Your brother is suffering from a form
of Pavor Nocturnus, or night terrors.

324
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:28,055  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:379 Y2:452
Because of his lack of sleep,
he's suffered a psychotic break.

325
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:34,228  X1:104 X2:609 Y1:379 Y2:446
Once that occurs, the subject can't
discern what is real and what is not.

326
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:38,739  X1:103 X2:610 Y1:379 Y2:452
-They begin to manifest a response.
-How do you mean?

327
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:44,745  X1:079 X2:635 Y1:379 Y2:452
A patient may hurt themselves because
they believe what they dream is real.

328
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:50,785  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:379 Y2:452
Michael feels that something
is after him, wanting to kill him.

329
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:56,359  X1:135 X2:578 Y1:379 Y2:452
And his self-inflicted wounds
are consistent with this fantasy.

330
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,156  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:379 Y2:452
The good news is that there is
a procedure we can perform...

331
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,767  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:379 Y2:452
...right here, which has had an
overwhelming success rate.

332
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,835  X1:257 X2:457 Y1:379 Y2:450
-ls it surgical?
-No, not at all.

333
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,938  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:379 Y2:452
Michael is placed in a sensory
deprivation chamber.

334
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,771  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:379 Y2:452
He faces his fears and realizes
there's nothing to fear.

335
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,378  X1:314 X2:400 Y1:421 Y2:446
Tests.

336
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,613  X1:187 X2:526 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Michael hates the dark.
-Yeah.

337
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,776  X1:243 X2:470 Y1:421 Y2:452
That's the point.

338
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,256  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:421 Y2:452
ls there any other alternative?

339
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:33,429  X1:182 X2:531 Y1:379 Y2:452
Aggressive medication
coupled with counseling.

340
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:39,896  X1:094 X2:619 Y1:379 Y2:452
There are no guarantees. Meanwhile,
Michael might hurt himself again.

341
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,305  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:379 Y2:452
Ray and l were just sitting there,
having drinks...

342
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,950  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:379 Y2:452
...and Walsh starts fighting
with Ray....

343
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,383  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Where are my flashlights?
-Lab's not done with them.

344
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,882  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:421 Y2:452
That's all you remember?

345
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,084  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:379 Y2:452
The words you're looking for
are ''thank you.''

346
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,090  X1:185 X2:528 Y1:421 Y2:452
Hey, Kyle! Kyle, wait up!

347
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:15,130  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:379 Y2:452
l'm having a bad day, Kyle.
l had a dead guy fall on me.

348
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,406  X1:175 X2:538 Y1:379 Y2:452
You want to tell me where
you're going, huh? Kyle?

349
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:45,357  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:379 Y2:446
-How about a pistola? Huh?
-No.

350
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,741  X1:218 X2:495 Y1:421 Y2:446
Wait here a minute.

351
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,381  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Okay, now what?
-Where's your car?

352
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,922  X1:219 X2:494 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Why?
-l need a ride. Now!

353
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:13,256  X1:086 X2:626 Y1:379 Y2:452
Yeah. Car's over here. Hey, man,
you've been released into my custody.

354
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,898  X1:246 X2:468 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Kyle!
-lt's 5:35, Larry.

355
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:21,868  X1:082 X2:633 Y1:379 Y2:452
The sun sets in 20 minutes. You've got
20 minutes to get me to the hospital.

356
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:29,011  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:379 Y2:452
We're almost set up.
lt'll just be another 1 5 minutes.

357
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:33,081  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Where's the other doctor?
-He had to get back upstate.

358
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,013  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:421 Y2:452
So you'll be doing this?

359
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,747  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:421 Y2:452
Why did you come back?

360
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,323  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:379 Y2:452
Do you know how long l've tried
to get through to her?

361
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:45,360  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:379 Y2:452
Her brother's always there
and then the ghost.

362
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,058  X1:294 X2:420 Y1:421 Y2:452
A ghost?

363
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,690  X1:285 X2:428 Y1:421 Y2:450
You, man.

364
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,294  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:379 Y2:446
Nobody in this town
had a chance with her.

365
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,904  X1:116 X2:597 Y1:421 Y2:452
All she could think about was you.

366
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,873  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l need you to sign these.
-What are they?

367
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:04,037  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:379 Y2:452
Standard consent and release
of liability forms. He'll be fine.

368
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,240  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:379 Y2:452
Where are you taking me?
This isn't the way.

369
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,886  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:421 Y2:452
l'm not taking you to the hospital.

370
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,885  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:421 Y2:452
Lay low for the judge.

371
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,924  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l just want to help Michael.
-Michael's gonna be fine.

372
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:21,292  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:379 Y2:452
They're putting him in a sensory dep
tank. Gonna shut the lights out.

373
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,923  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:379 Y2:446
-They're putting him in the dark?
-Gonna fix him...

374
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,900  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:379 Y2:452
...stop him from becoming
the next Kyle Walsh.

375
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:39,208  X1:116 X2:597 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt's gonna be okay. l'm gonna be
watching you from the other room.

376
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:45,611  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:379 Y2:452
lf you put me in the dark,
she'll get me.

377
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,314  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt'll all be over soon, okay?

378
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,364  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:421 Y2:446
Turn this car around now.

379
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,336  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:421 Y2:446
Take me to Michael.

380
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,473  X1:249 X2:464 Y1:421 Y2:446
What if l don't?

381
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,588  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:421 Y2:452
Larry, don't look at her!

382
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,661  X1:231 X2:482 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Help! Help! Kyle!
-Larry!

383
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,897  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:421 Y2:452
Help! Help me!

384
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,641  X1:250 X2:462 Y1:421 Y2:452
Oh, God! Help!

385
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,921  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:421 Y2:452
Come on, Larry. l know it's in here.

386
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,996  X1:191 X2:522 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Saint Francis Hospital.
-I need Caitlin Greene.

387
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,601  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:421 Y2:452
One moment, please.

388
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,065  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Miss Greene is unavailable.
-This is Kyle Walsh.

389
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:22,679  X1:096 X2:617 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l need to talk to her now.
-Sorry. Miss Greene is not available.

390
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:27,476  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:379 Y2:446
Don't let her put Michael in the dark.
l'm almost there.

391
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,945  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:421 Y2:452
Hello, police?

392
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,563  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:379 Y2:452
Now, Michael, l'm going to need you
to hold still. Okay?

393
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,672  X1:129 X2:584 Y1:421 Y2:452
There might be just a little sting.

394
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,677  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:379 Y2:446
-What's he doing?
-Hold him.

395
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,911  X1:095 X2:618 Y1:379 Y2:446
-There might be a burning sensation.
-Hold him down.

396
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,455  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:421 Y2:446
lt's all in.

397
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,291  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt's all right. lt's almost over.

398
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,371  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:421 Y2:452
Dim the lights.

399
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,719  X1:320 X2:393 Y1:421 Y2:452
Stop!

400
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,830  X1:202 X2:510 Y1:421 Y2:446
Take him out of there!

401
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,661  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:421 Y2:452
Please, just do it.

402
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,968  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay. The three of us are leaving.

403
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,909  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Michael, it'll be okay.
-l got a car waiting.

404
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,410  X1:322 X2:391 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle!

405
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,974  X1:201 X2:512 Y1:421 Y2:452
Stop resisting, Walsh.

406
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,010  X1:255 X2:458 Y1:421 Y2:452
Stop resisting.

407
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,854  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:421 Y2:452
Don't put him in the dark.

408
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,390  X1:224 X2:490 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Come on.
-Michael was right.

409
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,619  X1:187 X2:525 Y1:421 Y2:446
You have to believe me.

410
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,036  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Let's see your lawyer get you out.
-That'll be tough...

411
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,303  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:379 Y2:446
...since my lawyer's in pieces
on Ponus Avenue.

412
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,538  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:421 Y2:446
ls that a confession?

413
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,677  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:421 Y2:452
Okay, l'll give this a shot.

414
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:49,883  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:379 Y2:446
l saw something when l was 1 0. You
heard the stories as a kid. We all did.

415
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,794  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:379 Y2:452
l saw her kill my mother. And once
you've seen her, she doesn't stop.

416
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,595  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:379 Y2:452
l've stayed in the light since.
lt's the only way to be safe.

417
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,534  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:379 Y2:452
Michael has seen her too,
and she's coming for us.

418
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,441  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:379 Y2:446
l thought you'd say something
like that.

419
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,340  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:379 Y2:452
How many unsolved murders
have you had?

420
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,380  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:379 Y2:446
Not just this year,
but in the last 1 00?

421
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,215  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:421 Y2:452
How many of them involved children?

422
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,387  X1:210 X2:502 Y1:421 Y2:452
You're crazy, Walsh.

423
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,060  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:421 Y2:452
Crazy isn't what it used to be.

424
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,765  X1:183 X2:529 Y1:421 Y2:452
Yeah, Dad? We got him.

425
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:48,306  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:379 Y2:450
-What the hell's going on?
-No, no.

426
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,196  X1:215 X2:498 Y1:421 Y2:452
We're all gonna die.

427
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,825  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:379 Y2:452
Roy, you cover the docks, all right?
Get going.

428
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:11,202  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:379 Y2:450
-What the hell is going on tonight?
-l don't know, Dad.

429
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,672  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Matt, take care of this.
-Yeah, all right.

430
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,350  X1:167 X2:546 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Batten, see what that was.
-No, you go see.

431
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,717  X1:084 X2:629 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l outrank you.
-Lead by example and see what it was.

432
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,223  X1:230 X2:483 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Take a flashlight.
-Walsh, shut up.

433
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,862  X1:147 X2:566 Y1:421 Y2:452
Andy, give me your flashlight.

434
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,161  X1:242 X2:471 Y1:421 Y2:452
Stay in the light.

435
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,841  X1:325 X2:389 Y1:421 Y2:446
Shit.

436
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,251  X1:298 X2:415 Y1:421 Y2:446
Damn it!

437
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,416  X1:289 X2:424 Y1:421 Y2:446
Come on.

438
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,521  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:379 Y2:446
-What's going on here?
-Come on!

439
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,961  X1:204 X2:509 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Jimmy, stay with me!
-l'm staying with you!

440
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,934  X1:312 X2:402 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Matt!
-Matt?

441
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,142  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Go tell Batten l shot his dog.
-You shot Rocky?

442
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,107  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:421 Y2:450
No, Phil. l shot at him.

443
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,447  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:421 Y2:452
lt was quick.

444
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,656  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:421 Y2:452
ls she gonna get me?

445
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,794  X1:325 X2:387 Y1:421 Y2:446
Yes.

446
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,970  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:421 Y2:446
Man. What the--?

447
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,969  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Stay in the light.

460
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,062  X1:145 X2:568 Y1:421 Y2:452
She can't hurt you in the light!

461
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,275  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:421 Y2:452

There's nothing to worry about.

477
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,911  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:421 Y2:446
What the hell is that?

484
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,460  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:421 Y2:452
How do we stop it?

-Great.

487
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,464  X1:131 X2:581 Y1:421 Y2:452

-Anybody grab it?
-No.

496
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,838  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:421 Y2:452
Damn. We need to get to the lobby.

497
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,774  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:379 Y2:452
How long do we have
the emergency lights?

498
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,143  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:379 Y2:452
-A couple of minutes.

499
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,844  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:379 Y2:452

502
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,894  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Where are the stairs?

503
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:29,158  X1:146 X2:567 Y1:379 Y2:446
When this hospital goes dark,
we're all dead.

504
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,764  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Through to the old wing.

505
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:36,667  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt's not after them. lt's after us.
We saw it. They didn't.

506
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,670  X1:244 X2:469 Y1:421 Y2:446
What about us?

507

508
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,217  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:379 Y2:446
This just keeps getting better

509
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,724  X1:268 X2:446 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Come on.

521

522
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,187  X1:145 X2:567 Y1:421 Y2:452
We're gonna jump all at once.

523
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,958  X1:141 X2:571 Y1:379 Y2:452
We'll give her multiple targets.
Okay?

524

548

We're going to the lighthouse. lt's got

Why don't we keep driving?

551
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,381  X1:206 X2:507 Y1:421 Y2:446
We're safe in the car.

559
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,365  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:379 Y2:446
There's two kerosene lanterns

560
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,256  X1:248 X2:466 Y1:421 Y2:446
This must be it.

562
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:56,350  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:421 Y2:452
Kyle, there's the tank.

563
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,052  X1:289 X2:424 Y1:421 Y2:446
Come on.

564
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,503  X1:192 X2:521 Y1:421 Y2:452
Get all the gas in there.

565
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,769  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:379 Y2:452
There's enough there to last us
a week. Let's go.

566
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,478  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:421 Y2:452
Let's go. Come on.

567
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,712  X1:297 X2:415 Y1:421 Y2:452
All right.

568
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,082  X1:289 X2:424 Y1:421 Y2:446
Come on.

569
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,792  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:421 Y2:452
Let's go, Michael.

570
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,898  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:421 Y2:452
Get up there, Michael.

571
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,295  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:379 Y2:452
lf that thing hates bright light,
she's not gonna come here.

572
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,742  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:421 Y2:446
Damn it. Come on.

573
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,677  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:379 Y2:446
-What happened?
-l don't know.

574
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:58,252  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:379 Y2:452
Must be a fuel line blockage.
lt's not getting to the generator.

575
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:03,154  X1:097 X2:616 Y1:379 Y2:452
-That's encouraging.
-Lanterns aren't gonna last that long.

576
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:08,725  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:379 Y2:452
-We're gonna have to go fix it.
-What do you mean ''we''?

577
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,867  X1:263 X2:451 Y1:379 Y2:446
-You and me.
-No.

578
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,902  X1:173 X2:540 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt's the only way to do it.
We'll be right back, okay?

579
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:19,504  X1:282 X2:431 Y1:379 Y2:452
-l promise.
-Kyle.

580
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,777  X1:154 X2:557 Y1:379 Y2:452
lf anything happens to me,
just keep that thing off them.

581
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,715  X1:163 X2:550 Y1:421 Y2:452
All right, same goes for me.

582
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,355  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:421 Y2:452
This thing's gonna kill us, isn't it?

583
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,116  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:421 Y2:452
Probably.

584
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,058  X1:160 X2:552 Y1:421 Y2:452
All this over a fucking tooth.

585
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,131  X1:191 X2:522 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Do you smell that?
-Yeah, gas everywhere.

586
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,002  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:421 Y2:452
Don't drop that lantern, will you?

587
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,509  X1:105 X2:608 Y1:421 Y2:452
She comes at you fast, so be ready.

588
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,173  X1:149 X2:564 Y1:379 Y2:452
''She''?
You sound like you know her.

589
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,649  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:421 Y2:452
She's been in my life a long time.

590
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,583  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Hold up.
-Did you see that?

591
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,951  X1:128 X2:584 Y1:421 Y2:452
Wait up for me. Stay in the light.

592
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:16,929  X1:146 X2:567 Y1:421 Y2:452
Oh, man. lt doesn't look good.

593
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:23,129  X1:139 X2:574 Y1:379 Y2:446
-There's gas all over the place.
-Yeah.

594
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:29,475  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:379 Y2:446
l've gotta tighten this rag
around this leak.

595
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:34,344  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:379 Y2:452
Hurry up.
This lamp's not gonna last long.

596
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:41,679  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:379 Y2:452
-Caitlin, quickly. Here.
-What, this? Okay.

597
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,221  X1:235 X2:479 Y1:421 Y2:452
l need more light.

598
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,672  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:421 Y2:452
Get back. Get back in the light.

599
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,080  X1:154 X2:559 Y1:421 Y2:452
The kerosene's almost gone.

600
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:19,694  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:421 Y2:452
Come on. Okay. Oh, God. Okay.

601
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,457  X1:265 X2:448 Y1:421 Y2:452
Jump! Jump!

602
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:15,212  X1:161 X2:552 Y1:421 Y2:452
Michael, get out of the dark!

603
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,546  X1:289 X2:424 Y1:421 Y2:446
Come on.

604
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,502  X1:172 X2:541 Y1:421 Y2:452
We're losing the light fast.

605
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:44,503  X1:100 X2:613 Y1:379 Y2:446
l gotta move you. l gotta flip
the switch before the flame runs out.

606
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,550  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:421 Y2:446
Come on. Come on.

607
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,501  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:421 Y2:450
Hit that switch, Michael.

608
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,281  X1:246 X2:467 Y1:421 Y2:450
Go on, Michael.

609
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,848  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:379 Y2:446
-Get it, Michael.

610
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,320  X1:268 X2:445 Y1:421 Y2:450
Go, Michael!

611
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,228  X1:153 X2:559 Y1:421 Y2:452
This light's almost going out!

612
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,503  X1:268 X2:445 Y1:421 Y2:450
Go, Michael!

613
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,715  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:421 Y2:446
Michael. Michael.

614
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,906  X1:173 X2:540 Y1:421 Y2:452
All right. Wait here, okay?

615
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,219  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:421 Y2:446

01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,358  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:421 Y2:452
Just leave this here, Billy.

621
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,834  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:421 Y2:452
You're gonna go to sleep now?

623
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,624  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:421 Y2:452
Tooth Fairy?

624
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:38,030  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:379 Y2:452
lt's just Mommy, honey.
Go back to sleep.
