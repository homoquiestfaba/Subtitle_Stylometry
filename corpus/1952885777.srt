00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,067
(Dog barking)

2
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:59,306
- Welcome to my lab,
Mr. Rodriguez.

3
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:00,641
How was your flight?

4
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:01,642
(Grunting)

5
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,578
Terrific! We could not
do this without you!

6
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,680
Thank you so much
for your cooperation.

7
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,616
Could you please
escort Mr. Rodriguez

8
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,484
up on the platform?

9
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:11,519
Thank you.

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,753
Dimitri, it's time.

11
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:14,988
- Da. We are ready
for you, Doctor.

12
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,658
- Oh, our time has
finally come, Dimitri!

13
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,528
Tonight, we crack
the code on baby language,

14
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:23,764
allowing adults to
communicate with their babies.

15
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:27,100
Please put Mr. Rodriguez

16
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:28,902
into the Demistifier.

17
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:29,936
- Da.

18
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,105
Hello, Mr. Rodriguez.

19
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:34,608
Now, this will be over
before you know it.

20
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,177
Would you like me
to hold that?

21
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:37,178
Thank you.

22
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:39,046
Now, please,
to get into Demistifier.

23
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,649
- Dimitri, when the
Demistification is complete,

24
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,719
Mr. Rodriguez will be able to
speak the baby-monkey language

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,788
and understand
the baby monkey!

26
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,824
Mr. Rodriguez will speak
fluent baby-monkey language!

27
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:54,295
- (Automated voice):
Stand by for Demistification.

28
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:56,129
10...

29
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,833
9, 8, 7, 6...

30
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:02,336
- Subject looks OK.

31
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,804
- Come on, come on, come on!

32
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:05,206
- Demistifier running!

33
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,174
- 1...
- Ah!

34
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,346
(Grunts)

35
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:14,248
- Oh... So...

36
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:17,751
Doctor, he's practically naked!

37
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:20,521
- Well, yes,
I can see that, Dimitri!

38
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,122
(Mr. Rodriguez chirping)

39
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:23,324
Hmm...

40
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,058
You know,
I might be mistaken,

41
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:28,529
but it appears as if
Mr. Rodriguez believes

42
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,331
that he's a baby, too!

43
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,266
- Is that what we wanted?

44
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,934
- Well, no, Dimitri!

45
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,637
We wanted him to
understand baby language,

46
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:37,771
not to become one!

47
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,573
It's the complete opposite!

48
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:43,510
Please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

49
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:44,811
(Mr. Rodriguez cooing)

50
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:46,347
Excuse me.

51
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:51,719
Ahh!

52
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,922
(Shouting, indistinct)

53
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:04,197
- Come on!
Let the kids go by!

54
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:07,635
¶ Mom, now that I'm gone... ¶

55
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:11,438
¶ Don't worry about tomorrow
'cause I'll be all right... ¶

56
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,440
Come on through Fairfield,

57
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:15,108
the town that
never stops moving!

58
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,610
Keep it coming!
Here we go!

59
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,479
¶ Taught me well
Now say goodbye ¶

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,881
¶ Don't look back
or you'll make me cry ¶

61
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:24,585
¶ Dad, you've been
my best friend... ¶

62
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:27,087
- Get your paper today!
Paper! Read it!

63
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,156
¶ You taught me more
than a thing or two ¶

64
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:32,092
¶ Be strong while I'm away ¶

65
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:35,162
¶ Keep me in your thoughts ¶

66
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,431
¶ Tear 'em from
the Opposite Day ¶

67
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:38,899
- I love my job!

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,668
¶ Opposite Day ¶

69
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,836
¶ Opposite Day ¶

70
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:45,639
¶ It's only once in a lifetime ¶

71
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,609
¶ Day
Opposite Day ¶

72
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,111
¶ Opposite Day ¶

73
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:54,114
¶ It happens once
in a lifetime... ¶

74
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,950
(Church bells clanging)

75
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,086
- I need you to go
to the supermarket.

76
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:03,824
- Jack, I told you
to go along,

77
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,360
and if the sales
go below 150, sell short.

78
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,928
I don't care what you say!

79
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:10,263
If the sales
go below 150, sell short!

80
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:12,199
¶ Sometimes just
wanna be a kid ¶

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,267
¶ Can't do things
like my mommy did ¶

82
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:15,936
¶ Oh yeah... ¶

83
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:19,373
- I've got 30 minutes for lunch!
I need a cab! Taxi!

84
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:22,309
- I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!

85
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,812
Now pay attention!

86
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,882
- It's your move, Marv.

87
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,386
¶ Keep it together till I'm back
from the Opposite Day... ¶

88
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,120
- You know,
it makes no sense.

89
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,491
In school, they want us to play
on the playground and slide.

90
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,793
When I do it at home,
my parents go nuts.

91
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:42,496
- You rubbed butter
on the banister

92
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:44,898
and slid down in
your underwear, Sammy.

93
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,266
- Give me a break, Carla!

94
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,335
Like I'm gonna
walk down 20 steps

95
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,337
every time I want
a snack from the fridge!

96
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:52,740
- What'd your parents do
when they found out?

97
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,641
- They grounded me
for the rest of day.

98
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,510
- Oh, that's so harsh!

99
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:57,978
- That's nothing!

100
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,881
Last week, I threw ice cream
at my little sister.

101
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,182
Got no dessert
for a week.

102
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:03,817
- No dessert?
For a whole week?

103
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:05,686
- Parents are so bossy!

104
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,255
All they wanna do
is make rules!

105
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,924
And every chance they get,
they ground me.

106
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:12,192
- For good reason.

107
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:14,395
If mom and dad let you do
whatever you wanted,

108
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,697
the house would be
wrecked by now.

109
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:18,499
- Well, when I'm a parent,

110
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,535
I'm gonna let my kids do
whatever they want.

111
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:22,536
- Sure, Sammy.

112
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,541
(Grunting in game)

113
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,378
Hey, Carla,
wanna trade games?

114
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,913
- I'm still playing.

115
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,783
- Today's Opposite Day,
which means you're not playing.

116
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,951
- Today's so not Opposite Day!

117
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:39,520
You just made that up!

118
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,789
- Well, you just said
it's not Opposite Day,

119
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,424
which means
it is Opposite Day,

120
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,258
which means if you are
using the game,

121
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,361
you really aren't using the game
which means I can have it.

122
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:49,863
- Here we go!

123
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:51,498
- Today could be...

124
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:54,334
Give Your Brother
the Game Day!

125
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,037
But you're still not getting it!

126
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:02,476
- This life of ours,
if we can even call it a life,

127
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,144
is totally unfair!

128
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,580
We could easily do
what our parents can do.

129
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:09,082
Make dinner,
raise a family.

130
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,717
Ha! Piece of cake!

131
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,886
- Cake? Don't mind if I do!

132
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:15,288
- Yet they tell us what to do?
I don't think so!

133
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,559
- If kids ran the world,
it would be so much better.

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,660
- I say starting now,

135
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,662
we stop letting adults
tell us what to do.

136
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:22,663
- Yeah!

137
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:23,664
- Hey, guys.

138
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,332
- What's up, Chaz?

139
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,633
- What ya talking about?

140
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:29,336
- The boys think kids
should be in charge of parents.

141
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:32,773
I mean, that could never happen.
That's just... whoo!

142
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:34,475
- Who needs parents?

143
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,777
- I don't know.
I kind of like my dad.

144
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:38,846
I just wish
he'd play with me more.

145
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:42,349
At least he tucks me
into bed at night.

146
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,150
- Ugh! Mom's here.

147
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,285
- Hey, guys!

148
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,987
- Mom!

149
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,321
- Come on, baby.
Let's go.

150
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:50,824
- Hello!

151
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,894
- See you guys on Monday!

152
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,596
- TTYL, Sue!

153
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:57,831
- How was your day, kiddo?

154
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:58,832
- Pretty good.

155
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,833
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,434
- Wanna go for a bike ride?

157
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,436
- All right,
let's get going, OK?

158
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,806
'Cause I've got
a surprise for you both...

159
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:06,974
at home!

160
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:07,975
- Cool!

161
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,877
- (Sammy):
Cool!

162
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,049
(Cheering)

163
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,251
- Cinderella,
dressed in yellow...

164
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,498
- Look! It's Grandma
and Grandpa coming!

165
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:32,966
- Could only mean one thing!

166
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,868
- Guess where we're going!

167
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:36,336
- On vacation!
- On vacation!

168
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:37,337
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

169
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,339
- I'll see you. OK.

170
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,807
- Daddy!
- Hi!

171
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,576
I love you.

172
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,511
- Grandma, Grandpa!

173
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:45,646
- Dad! Ugh!

174
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,247
Don't embarrass me!

175
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,449
- Embarrass you in front
of who? Your mother?

176
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,884
What, I can't hug
my own son?

177
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:53,921
- It was cool
a couple of years ago.

178
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:55,789
- Someday you're
gonna be a parent,

179
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,123
and you're gonna realize

180
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:59,660
how important this bond is
between father-son.

181
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,127
- OK.

182
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:02,563
Can I go now?

183
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,698
- Yes.
- Cool.

184
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,033
- OK.

185
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:09,202
God, wouldn't it be great
to be a kid again, huh?

186
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:11,271
Get so excited
about everything.

187
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:12,405
- I don't know.

188
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:15,943
I wouldn't wanna give up
being married to you,

189
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,510
our fantastic kids,

190
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:20,280
our wonderful life together.

191
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:23,416
- I know.
Just for a day, though.

192
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,819
- (Jack):
Stop to get the fishing rods.

193
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,288
(Cell ringing)

194
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,356
- Sorry, I gotta take it.

195
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,993
Hi, Charles.

196
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,763
- Hey! Oh...

197
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,364
Hi, Ms. Jenkins.

198
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,366
- Dr. Larabee.

199
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,871
- Oh, thanks, Dad!
These are my favourite!

200
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,407
- You can't keep doing this.
It's not fair to Chaz.

201
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,342
And it certainly
is not fair to me!

202
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,343
- I know, I know.

203
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,846
But I will be here early
every day next week.

204
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:53,880
I promise!

205
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,083
- Hey, Dad,
I made this for you.

206
00:08:57,284 --> 00:09:00,453
- Hey! That's a nice job there!

207
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:01,822
Uh...

208
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,824
That's nice. That's...

209
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:08,328
So, we're in a bit of
a time crunch here, so...

210
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,163
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:12,398
You've really grown up, Son.

212
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,435
- All right,
we're all packed up!

213
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,337
Let's hit the road, Jack.

214
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:20,240
- Now, are you kids ready
for an old-fashioned

215
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,809
fun-in-the-sun vacation
in our new cabin?

216
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,345
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

217
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:27,247
(Laughing)

218
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:30,150
- I wanna sit in the middle.
- No, that's not fair!

219
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:33,153
- Scooch over!
- What is it, hon?

220
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,355
- Charles needs me to
come into the office.

221
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:37,257
- Right now?

222
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:38,358
- It's ridiculous,

223
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,493
but my client
pushed up his deadline

224
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:43,964
and now I've got 2 weeks'
worth of work to do in 2 days.

225
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,932
- And what about our vacation?

226
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,635
- You'll just have to
go without me.

227
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:52,105
- Something's wrong.

228
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:54,207
- If you're not going,
I'm not going.

229
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,642
- No, go. Have fun.

230
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,644
- Denise, I'm not
going on vacation

231
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,445
while you're stuck
in the office.

232
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,648
Besides, it'll be good
for Mom and Pop

233
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,850
to have a weekend
alone with the kids.

234
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,385
And who knows,

235
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:06,887
maybe you can
finish up early

236
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,955
and we can get
some time to ourselves.

237
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,791
- That would be nice.

238
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:14,594
- I thought this was supposed
to be a family vacation.

239
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,998
- Now don't you worry.

240
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,500
I'll take good care
of the kids.

241
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,069
What's their names again?

242
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,136
(Laughing)

243
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,538
- He's joking. I think.

244
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,075
- I'm just
yanking their chain.

245
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,743
All right, kids!

246
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,745
Wave goodbye
to your parents!

247
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,314
You may never see them again!

248
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,849
- Bye, Pop!

249
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,217
Bye, guys!

250
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:38,919
- Bye, Daddy!
I'll miss you!

251
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,721
- I love you, princess. Bye!

252
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:42,889
- Bye, Daddy!

253
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,436
- I'm really
proud of you, Son.

254
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,911
¶ There's only one thing
in my mind ¶

255
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:07,247
¶ I'm leaving
everything behind ¶

256
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:09,515
¶ I'm just looking
for good times... ¶

257
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,918
- If I was in charge,

258
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,287
I would not ruin
a family vacation

259
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:15,421
for stupid work!

260
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:16,689
- I agree.

261
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:23,429
¶ Heading down
this endless road ¶

262
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,766
¶ Breaking down on open doors ¶

263
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:28,301
¶ Taking chances
is fine with me ¶

264
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,170
¶ Better off on what you need ¶

265
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:32,372
¶ To live it up to me ¶

266
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:34,674
¶ I can make you see... ¶

267
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:36,409
Awesome!

268
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,779
Dude!

269
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,913
- This is so cool!

270
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:41,782
- Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

271
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,083
Come on! Come on!

272
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,417
- Come on, Grandpa!

273
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,419
- Hey, kids, for dinner,

274
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,555
I'm gonna make hot dogs
with macaroni and cheese,

275
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:52,826
homemade ice cream
and gummy bears!

276
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,961
- I love gummy bears!
- Gummy bears! Yes!

277
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,496
- Gummy bears!
- Whoo!

278
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:58,698
- You are going to have
so much fun,

279
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,867
it's going to come out
of your ears!

280
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,973
- Emily, I need to see
those layouts.

281
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:08,909
Oh, Denise.

282
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,778
I just got an email
from Tyler at Skin So Smooth.

283
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,414
They wanna start their slogan
with "Smooth..."

284
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:16,482
It's up to us
to figure out the rest.

285
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,819
And by "up to us,"
that means up to you.

286
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,021
- Oh...

287
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,722
- Good luck.

288
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:28,361
- OK, if I crank this out
double time,

289
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:30,630
I still might make it
to the cabin.

290
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,066
- Yeah, right.
Good luck, girl.

291
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:40,773
- All right, now, this is
Dimitri's son, Alexei, huh?

292
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:43,944
- Don't worry, let me
put the coat on the doctor.

293
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:46,546
- You're late.
Make a note of that, please.

294
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:48,181
- Yes, sir,
Mr. Montgomery.

295
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:49,716
- My sincerest apologies.

296
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,118
You know, it's no small feat
working 14-hour days

297
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,820
and raising a child
on your own.

298
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,056
- Spare me the excuses, Godfrey.

299
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:59,025
As you know, the board
is expecting me to advise

300
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,794
on next fall's product launch
this Thursday.

301
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:04,898
Either you show us something
we can use in the launch,

302
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,533
or I'm afraid I'm going to
have to let you go.

303
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:09,702
Now, what have you got for us?

304
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:10,904
- Uh...

305
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,172
Well...

306
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:14,341
let's start with the birds!

307
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:17,143
- Ah, the bird! Ha-ha! Good.

308
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,478
Come on.

309
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,712
- After you.

310
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,582
- Now, did you know

311
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,352
that overnight-express
delivery companies' employees

312
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:28,388
are paid $20 an hour
for their deliveries?

313
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,590
So I started thinking,

314
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:32,592
what if we started a company

315
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:36,263
with employees that could be
paid in birdfeed, literally?

316
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:38,865
- (Dimitri): Ta-da!

317
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,100
- Even as we speak,

318
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,668
we are in production on
a fleet of thousands of birds

319
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,271
that would travel
at mach speed,

320
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:47,374
delivering packages all over
the world, 24 hours a day!

321
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,777
I call it Bird Express!

322
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:54,080
- What does that
have to do with babies?

323
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,516
- Oh... Well, I mean...

324
00:13:56,517 --> 00:14:00,220
other than the classic mythology
of birds delivering newborns,

325
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,688
technically, really nothing.

326
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:05,425
- It's stupid.
- And a waste of money.

327
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,160
- What else do you have?

328
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:09,396
- Right. No.
Forget the bird.

329
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,131
Yeah, just a little
side project

330
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,599
to sort of
whet your appetite.

331
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,935
Ooh, come here!

332
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:19,239
Feast your eyes on
the future of sports!

333
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,441
Hmm? Bats hit.

334
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,909
Clubs swing.

335
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,910
(Club beeping)

336
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,012
Ooh, all on their own!

337
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,284
Oh!

338
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,719
You see, the automated motion,

339
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,656
it teaches kids to play sports
with the proper form.

340
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:38,458
Ooh, look at this!

341
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,462
(Beeping)

342
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,168
Oh!

343
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:50,937
- Oh my God, are you OK,
Mr. Montgomery?

344
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:52,638
- It's all right.
- Be careful!

345
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,275
- You call that a punch?
No, I don't think so.

346
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,977
- Thank you for
your patience, sir.

347
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:58,979
Yeah, hey, we're just
getting warmed up!

348
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,013
Right, Dimitri?

349
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,348
- (Dimitri): OK.

350
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:04,517
- Now, this next one
is for the parents.

351
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:06,019
And I call it Slow Ray.

352
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,087
(Whirring)

353
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:08,188
Watching a baby

354
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,523
when you have other
household responsibilities,

355
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,860
it's challenging because
they're all over the place.

356
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,628
falling, getting
into everything.

357
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:18,598
But if you slow them down...

358
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,566
Ahh...

359
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,471
How far can they go?

360
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:27,207
Hmm? How much can they destroy?

361
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,443
- That is fascinating,
but how is the effect reversed?

362
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,314
- Thank you, Doctor!

363
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:36,182
- What happens
if you shoot your kid

364
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:38,051
with the fast mode first?

365
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,486
- Good point.
- Oh, well...

366
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,654
- So far I've seen
absolutely nothing

367
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:43,156
worth mentioning
to the board.

368
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,357
If anything,

369
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,925
hearing what you have to say

370
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,193
has mad me stupider.

371
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,794
Are we done yet?

372
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:51,364
- I think we're done.
- My dad always has problems.

373
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,033
- No, no, no!
No, we're not done!

374
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:56,403
There's still one more
invention left!

375
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:57,970
- (Dimitri): There is?
- Yeah.

376
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:01,241
Um, this is something
that I've been working on

377
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,475
since my Ph.D. days.

378
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:04,911
It's a machine
that allows adults

379
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,546
to speak baby language!

380
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:07,547
Yeah!

381
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:08,948
- All due respect, sir,

382
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,716
but have you lost your mind?

383
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:11,817
- Not now.
Not now.

384
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:14,487
- You're telling me
that parents would be able

385
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:16,056
to talk with their babies.

386
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,591
- It will revolutionize
parenting as we know it.

387
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,826
- Now you're speaking
my language.

388
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:24,864
- There's just one tiny
little itty-bitty problem.

389
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:27,367
- We don't like problems.
- We don't do that word.

390
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:30,836
- Well, it's still sort of
in the testing phase.

391
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:34,107
- Godfrey, how much
would you say you enjoy

392
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:36,242
working here at Cuddledyne?

393
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:39,179
A whole lot?
Not so much?

394
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,481
(Insects buzzing, chirping)

395
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,785
- Get off me!
- No, you get off!

396
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,853
- Now, now, possums,

397
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:50,457
these two beds
are exactly the same.

398
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,127
- Martha, I built both
these beds with my bare hands.

399
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,496
Sammy is right.
That one is better!

400
00:16:56,497 --> 00:16:58,198
Not to mention the view.

401
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,399
- Huh?

402
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,033
- Stop teasing the kids!

403
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:03,803
- Come on, they're both
exactly the same.

404
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,805
- Oh, look!

405
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,675
It's the first star.

406
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:12,979
You know,
if you wish on it,

407
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,181
your dreams will come true.

408
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,317
I wished on it

409
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,286
that I would meet someone
wonderful like your grandpa,

410
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,588
and I did!

411
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,657
- Are you saying that
we can make a wish?

412
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,925
- Uh-huh.

413
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:28,794
But make sure
your wish counts.

414
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:32,064
Good night, angel.

415
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:36,769
- Good night.

416
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,471
- Good night, Grandpa.

417
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,542
- (Both): And don't let
the bedbugs bite!

418
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:43,709
(Laughing)

419
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:54,387
- You know, Grandma and Grandpa
are pretty cool.

420
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,201
I have a wish.

421
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,506
I wish that kids...

422
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,875
ruled the world.

423
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:19,312
- And I wish you would
stop talking so I can sleep!

424
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,080
(Exhales)

425
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:30,790
- You know, we should build
an underwater city, too.

426
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,892
That way, people would have
a place to live

427
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,127
once global warming
melts the polar icecaps

428
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:36,162
and floods the world.

429
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,330
- That's a good idea.

430
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,732
- How's my little Chaz-mataz?
- Hey, Dad.

431
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,767
- Today, you're gonna be
my little helper.

432
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:42,802
How does that sound?

433
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,704
- I'd love to help you.
- OK.

434
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:47,173
Come here.
Uh, listen...

435
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:48,575
I want to show you something

436
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,610
that's gonna make
both our lives better.

437
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,611
How's that sound?

438
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,413
- You made me a robot?
- Not quite.

439
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:54,847
Dimitri, it's time.

440
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:55,881
- Da.

441
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:57,250
- All right, look, Chaz,

442
00:18:57,251 --> 00:19:00,720
I just need you to sit in here
and be still, all right?

443
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,623
It's completely safe.
I designed it myself.

444
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:05,391
Trust me.
I'm your father!

445
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:06,826
You'll be the first child

446
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:09,329
who will be able to
communicate with babies!

447
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,830
You'll know baby language.

448
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:14,634
Our lives will be
completely changed after this.

449
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,338
- Some father you are!

450
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,873
- We are about to make history!

451
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,509
- You say that at all
your demonstrations.

452
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,011
- Yeah, I know.
OK, Son!

453
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:28,581
- Initiating uplink
to maternity ward.

454
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:31,417
Connecting to baby subject.

455
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:33,853
- I can't believe
you'd do this to your own son!

456
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:36,789
I'd make a better father
than you!

457
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,760
How can you test a machine on me
that doesn't even work?

458
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,429
I hate this machine!
I hate it! I hate it!

459
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,131
(Alarm blaring)

460
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:47,533
- Malfunction. Malfunction.

461
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,735
- No! Chaz!

462
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,970
- You care more
about work than me!

463
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:52,071
- That's not true!

464
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,039
- I am pulling the plug
on this program!

465
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,908
When I'm finished with you,

466
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,444
you'll be lucky if you get
a job flipping burgers!

467
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:18,898
- Hickory, dickory, dare,
the pigs flew up in the air!

468
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,100
Hickory, dickory, dare,

469
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,169
the kids flew up in the air!

470
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,471
Hickory, dickory, dare,

471
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:28,240
the pigs flew up in the air!

472
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:30,009
Hickory, dickory, dare...

473
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,078
- Oh, Dad, I got so scared!

474
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,281
Almost pooped my pants!

475
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,116
Whoa!

476
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,018
Look how big my hands are!

477
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,252
Ahh!

478
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,854
I'm like a monster!

479
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,088
Ahh!

480
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,157
(Screams)

481
00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:46,793
- Ahh!

482
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,528
- Look at your hair!

483
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:51,197
Na-na-na-na-na!
I want to play tag with you!

484
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:53,366
I want to play tag with you!

485
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,767
(Dimitri giggling)

486
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:56,669
- (Woman):
Whee!

487
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,009
- Computer, tell me
what happened.

488
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,213
- The Demistifier has had
a complete malfunction,

489
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:08,481
resulting in leakage.

490
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:10,616
- Dr. Larabee?

491
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,719
Is everything all right?

492
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,821
- Uh, Dr. Larabee?

493
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,524
Yeah, I'm Dr. Larabee.

494
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:21,026
Computer, what happened
to all of us?

495
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:24,464
- This leakage has created
a mist over the entire city

496
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:25,832
for a 5-mile radius,

497
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,068
causing all family members
to switch identities,

498
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,771
parents taking on their
children's personalities

499
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:34,741
and children taking on
their parents' personalities.

500
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:38,043
- Are you saying that this mist
causes kids to act like adults

501
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:39,512
and adults to act like kids?

502
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,146
- That is correct.

503
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:45,084
- Very good, computer.
Very good.

504
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,846
(¶ Reggae ¶)

505
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:31,297
- Martha! Martha!
- What?

506
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,666
- Do you see what I see?

507
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,303
(Parents giggling)

508
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:40,640
I guess... I guess
I'm just imagining it.

509
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:46,312
- (Boy):
OK to cross now, kids.

510
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:49,048
- Last one's a rotten egg!

511
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,919
- This isn't Halloween,
is it, dear?

512
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,287
- No, no,
the last time I checked,

513
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:56,656
Halloween is in October.

514
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:57,957
- I know what it is.

515
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,460
You must have made
a wrong turn.

516
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,361
- I know exactly
where we are!

517
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,564
Please, don't give me
a hard time.

518
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:05,898
(Horn honking)

519
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,834
Kids, kids!
Wake up! Wake up!

520
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:10,970
Did you see what I see?
Look! Look! Look!

521
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:12,137
- Whoa!

522
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:14,740
- Hey, bub,
get the lead out of it!

523
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,609
- (Carla):
That kid is driving!

524
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,944
- Kids can't drive!

525
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,079
- No, Sammy, please,
she's right.

526
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,747
They're not just driving!

527
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,249
They're doing everything,
these kids!

528
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,786
¶ Mom, now that I'm gone ¶

529
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:30,122
¶ Don't worry about tomorrow ¶

530
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:33,459
¶ 'Cause I'll be all right
on my own... ¶

531
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,596
- I've got 30 minutes for lunch.
I need a cab.

532
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:37,964
Taxi!

533
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,733
¶ Don't look back
or you'll make me cry ¶

534
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:44,203
¶ Dad, you've been
my best friend ¶

535
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:47,039
¶ You keep me up
when I'm feeling blue... ¶

536
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,876
- Keep it moving!
Keep it moving! Come on!

537
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:51,711
¶ Be strong while I'm away... ¶

538
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:54,279
Come on, keep it moving!
Keep it moving, people!

539
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,181
Come on! Come on!

540
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:58,484
Keep it moving!
Come on, keep it moving!

541
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:02,688
¶ Opposite Day
Opposite Day ¶

542
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:05,491
¶ It's only once in a lifetime ¶

543
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:08,594
¶ Day
Opposite Day ¶

544
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:11,030
¶ Opposite Day ¶

545
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:14,099
¶ It happens once
in a lifetime ¶

546
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:19,038
- Ice cream!

547
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,574
¶ Oh, well,
let's have some fun... ¶

548
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,411
- Get your fresh,
hot papers here!

549
00:24:25,412 --> 00:24:28,247
¶ Grow up really fast... ¶

550
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,416
- Jack, I told you to go long.

551
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:33,019
And if sales go below 150,
sell short.

552
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,820
I don't care what you say!

553
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,122
If sales go below 150,
sell short!

554
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,560
¶ Cooking things
and building too ¶

555
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:43,996
¶ Can't pay the bills
as good as you... 

556
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:47,033
- I need you to go to
the supermarket!

557
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:51,671
- So, when you vote
for Mayor Dugen,

558
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:56,141
know that you're not only
voting for free parking,

559
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:58,678
you're voting for freedom!

560
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:02,281
¶ Opposite Day ¶

561
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,149
¶ Opposite Day... ¶

562
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,086
- It looks like
the world's turned opposite!

563
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,921
- Like Opposite Day!

564
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:10,690
But do the math.

565
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:14,060
- All the kids are
acting weird, like adults.

566
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:16,862
- And all the adults
are acting like kids.

567
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,799
Wait, do you know
what this means?

568
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
- What?

569
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,434
- My wish came true!

570
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:24,070
Kids rule the world!

571
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:26,072
- How can you
be happy about this?

572
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:27,974
- Who wouldn't be?

573
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:29,041
- I guess me!

574
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,043
- Stop sign,
you knucklehead!

575
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:33,946
- Hey, I'm walking here!

576
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:35,380
- I didn't see it!

577
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:37,950
I'm losing
my concentration.

578
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:41,020
(Siren blaring)

579
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:51,664
Kids, now, be on
your best behaviour now.

580
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,265
I'll handle this.

581
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:56,102
Martha, if there's
one thing I know how to do,

582
00:25:56,103 --> 00:25:58,037
I know how to
deal with the law.

583
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:03,542
- License and registration.

584
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:07,113
- You know those
candid-camera shows?

585
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:09,682
We're on candid camera!

586
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:11,316
Very funny!

587
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:13,318
We see through you,
don't we?

588
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,319
Don't we?

589
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,354
- I don't know.

590
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,657
Maybe it's not a gag.

591
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,959
- Maybe it's not a gag?

592
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,061
- Do you have
a listening problem?

593
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:27,767
Little boy, you're operating
this automobile?

594
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:29,268
- I'm a little boy?

595
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:32,304
I think you're
a little confused, kiddo.

596
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:35,240
- What are you doing?

597
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:38,277
- What am I doing?
What do you think I'm doing?

598
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:40,379
If everything
really is opposite,

599
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,249
then Grandma and Grandpa are
2 little kids driving this car!

600
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,285
And you know
what that makes us?

601
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:49,288
- The adults! And we'd
be responsible for them!

602
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,091
- I'm not going to jail
for this. All right?

603
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:53,358
I'm sorry, Carla,

604
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,262
but if there's a world out there
where I get to call the shots,

605
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:58,831
I wanna be a part of it!

606
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:04,469
- What is he doing?

607
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:08,774
¶ Break my fall ¶

608
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:15,647
¶ Waking from a bad dream ¶

609
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:17,416
¶ Reaching out to find you ¶

610
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:20,552
¶ Gone again ¶

611
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:22,621
¶ I'm turning to my cell phone ¶

612
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:27,392
¶ Turning out to be
my oldest friend ¶

613
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:29,695
¶ And shame on you... ¶

614
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:32,031
- Hey, who are the adults here?
You or them?

615
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:33,532
- We are, of course!

616
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:35,935
- Yeah!

617
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:37,436
¶ It's the both of us ¶

618
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:42,174
¶ Can I make you see? ¶

619
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:46,178
- Ice cream! Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!

620
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,014
¶ Catch me if you dare ¶

621
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,050
¶ If you really want to see me ¶

622
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:52,985
¶ Take a second
just to recognize ¶

623
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:55,087
¶ How long
that I've been there ¶

624
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,922
¶ How can you help me? ¶

625
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:58,523
¶ How can you heal me? ¶

626
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:01,927
¶ You're never home
to take my call ¶

627
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:04,196
¶ You gotta show me... ¶

628
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:06,265
- Why you crying, mister?

629
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:08,533
- 'Cause my mommy
put me on timeout

630
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:10,035
'cause I pushed a kid!

631
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,637
- Too bad for you!

632
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:13,205
(Sobbing)

633
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:18,477
Hello there, lovely ladies.

634
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:21,046
- Oh, who is he?
He's cute!

635
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:24,483
- So, let me get this straight.

636
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,051
You're telling me that you,

637
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:29,221
a little boy,
from the looks of things,

638
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:32,624
is no more than 7 years old,
is a grandfather?

639
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,294
- That's what I've been
trying to tell you!

640
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:36,428
- This isn't good!

641
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:39,431
- Wait a minute, Officer.
I can vouch for him.

642
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:41,466
He's my husband of 45 years.

643
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,837
And in the back,
you can ask my grandkids.

644
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:49,175
- Listen, Officer,
maybe we can work this out.

645
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:53,345
I've got a box of
Girl Scout cookies in the trunk.

646
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:55,247
- What kind?
Wait a minute!

647
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,817
Are you trying to
bribe an officer?

648
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,819
- No! Just a few cookies!

649
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,153
- Animal crackers.

650
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,321
- Out of the car, son!

651
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:03,789
- Cooperate, Jack.

652
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,257
- I am cooperating!

653
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:08,327
¶ How can you help me?
How can you heal me? ¶

654
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:11,697
¶ You're never home
to take my call ¶

655
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:13,498
¶ You gotta show me ¶

656
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,201
¶ You wanna know me ¶

657
00:29:15,202 --> 00:29:18,670
¶ Gotta be there
to break my fall ¶

658
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:20,739
¶ Break my fall ¶

659
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,507
¶ Break my fall ¶

660
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:25,510
¶ You gotta be there ¶

661
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:28,881
¶ Break my fall ¶

662
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:32,818
¶ Oh, you should be there ¶

663
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,620
- Come on, keep it moving!
Keep it moving, people!

664
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:37,156
- On the sidewalk.

665
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:38,824
Hands on your head.

666
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,327
Put your right foot in.

667
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:44,563
Take your right foot out.

668
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:46,565
Put your left foot in.

669
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,300
And shake it all about.

670
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:51,737
I said the left foot!

671
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:54,373
Where are your parents?

672
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:56,708
- Oh, Martha,
I'm so confused! Please!

673
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:59,178
- I'm going to need you
to breathe into this.

674
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:06,986
- And then you go,
and then you and you.

675
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:08,487
All right? Next!

676
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,522
- Yeah!

677
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:12,491
- Next!
- Yeah! Whoo!

678
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:13,859
(Laughing)

679
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,928
- Walk the line,
tough guy!

680
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,863
- That's hopscotch!

681
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:21,233
- You too!
I said walk it

682
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:22,401
- I won't!
- You will!

683
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:23,535
- Won't!
- Will!

684
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:25,371
- Won't! I've had
enough of you!

685
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:26,638
You know what you are?

686
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:29,074
You're a little punk kid
in a cop's uniform!

687
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:31,343
- Is that right?

688
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:33,879
That's it,
we're going downtown!

689
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,149
- (Martha): Oh, you're making
a mistake, Officer!

690
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,184
All he did
was run a stop sign!

691
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,686
- Hey! It's not your turn yet!

692
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:46,125
Carla, I don't know
if this is just a dream

693
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:48,294
or if it's just
one huge practical joke,

694
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,461
but promise me

695
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:52,264
that we're gonna enjoy it
for as long as it lasts.

696
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:53,765
- Whatever you say, Sammy.

697
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,367
- What's your problem?

698
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:58,304
- Grandma and Grandpa
just got arrested!

699
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:00,005
(Exhales)

700
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,075
- Next!

701
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:04,776
(Siren blaring)

702
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:11,483
- Come on now,

703
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,819
is all of this
really necessary?

704
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,821
- Smile for the ducky!
Quack, quack!

705
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:18,457
- Can I get a copy of that?

706
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,393
- Fingerprint, please.

707
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:23,262
- Does it wash off?

708
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:25,464
- This is so childish.

709
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:27,599
- Take your time.

710
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:36,508
I want you to be really sure,
so take your time.

711
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,310
- It's him!
It's him on the right!

712
00:31:38,311 --> 00:31:40,312
- That one?

713
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:41,646
- I'm sure of it.

714
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:57,562
- You gotta believe me!

715
00:31:57,563 --> 00:31:59,831
I'm telling you,
I'm innocent!

716
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:01,533
- Tell it to the judge.

717
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,502
- Jasper, what are
you doing here?

718
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:05,937
- What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

719
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,873
I work here.
I'm a cop. Remember?

720
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:09,241
- No, I don't remember.

721
00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:11,443
A few days ago,
you were a normal kid,

722
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:12,478
just like us.

723
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,945
- What are you
talking about?

724
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:16,648
I've been on the force
since I was practically born!

725
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,817
- Are we the only ones
who can see that

726
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:20,452
everything has
turned opposite?

727
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:23,688
- All of a sudden,
kids are in charge,

728
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,191
like we talked about
in school the other day!

729
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:27,959
- In school?

730
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,195
- Everything's all mixed up!

731
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:32,131
- I'm sorry to say, guys,

732
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:34,500
but the only thing
mixed up is you!

733
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:37,569
Parents acting like kids?
Kids like parents?

734
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,505
Now that's hilarious!

735
00:32:39,506 --> 00:32:40,506
I promise you,

736
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:43,042
things are as normal
as they've always been.

737
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:45,677
- Well, there are these old...

738
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:50,549
There are these young kids
that just came in.

739
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,584
What's gonna happen to them?

740
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:54,019
- So, tell me...

741
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:56,155
Jack...

742
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:58,223
where were you
two hours ago?

743
00:32:58,224 --> 00:32:59,925
Was it on Main St.

744
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:02,194
in front of Casey's Market

745
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:06,065
in front of a stop sign
as bright as day?

746
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,767
- You Oompa-Loompas
can ask me all you want.

747
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:09,868
I ain't squealing!

748
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:11,002
- Don't worry, hon.

749
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:14,139
If it comes down to it,
I'll take the fall for you.

750
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,344
- They ain't cooperating, boss.

751
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,012
- They're playing it smart.

752
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:23,848
Won't speak without
an attorney present.

753
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,719
- I got it!

754
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,422
Maybe we should
throw the book at 'em!

755
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:33,192
- Yeah, good idea.
You're thinking.

756
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:38,697
They dodged the book!

757
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,399
- I'm out of ideas!

758
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,434
- Me too! What now?

759
00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:43,902
- How about we get a bite?

760
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:46,238
- OK. I'll drive.

761
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,540
- My treat, buddy.
- Thanks.

762
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,410
- What do you feel
like having today?

763
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:55,581
- All rise for
the honourable judge!

764
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,283
- Unh!

765
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:04,123
- Operating a vehicle
as a minor?

766
00:34:04,124 --> 00:34:08,327
Running a stop sign without
even saying you're sorry?

767
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:12,931
Trying to bribe an officer
with Girl Scout cookies?

768
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:16,301
And not even mentioning
they were thin mints!

769
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,803
- They were
animal crackers!

770
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:21,740
- Ugh, the list goes on and on!

771
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,542
You people make me sick!

772
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:26,077
Jack and Martha Benson,
please rise.

773
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:30,915
Seeing that this is
your first offence,

774
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,118
I've decided to
take it easy on you two.

775
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,853
- Ohh!

776
00:34:34,854 --> 00:34:37,589
- Twenty-five years
of solitary confinement!

777
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,425
- No! No!

778
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:41,726
- Bailiff, take them away!

779
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,131
- What kind of
a lawyer are you?

780
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:54,173
- Act as though you...
Act casual.

781
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,340
Oh my God...

782
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,009
(Growling)

783
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,844
- Oh my...

784
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:02,181
- Stay in a single line!

785
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:05,450
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

786
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:08,320
- (Boy):
I'm innocent!

787
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:18,297
- Want a lolly?

788
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:19,298
- No, thank you.

789
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,699
- That's very nice of you,

790
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,367
but we haven't
had dinner yet.

791
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:25,571
- How about a game
of tic-tac-toe?

792
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:27,472
- I don't know the rules.

793
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:28,674
- No, thank you.

794
00:35:30,843 --> 00:35:32,811
(Giggling)

795
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:43,188
¶ When I was a kid ¶

796
00:35:43,189 --> 00:35:45,824
¶ I would dream
that I was grown up ¶

797
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:48,793
¶ Finally on my own ¶

798
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:52,497
¶ No people to tell me
who, what, where, why... ¶

799
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:55,066
- Really appreciate it.
- Thanks, Jasper.

800
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,337
- I'm worried about you folks.

801
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:00,071
¶ I have hopes
I have dreams ¶

802
00:36:00,072 --> 00:36:02,541
¶ That one day
I'm gonna live my life ¶

803
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,109
¶ Just like I want to ¶

804
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,278
¶ Who do you wanna be... ¶

805
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,446
- I hope you're happy.

806
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:08,680
- About what?

807
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:11,950
- You know, if it wasn't
for your stupid wish,

808
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,886
Grandma and Grandpa
would still be with us

809
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,089
instead of sitting in
a stinky old jail cell!

810
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,758
- Well, it's not my fault.

811
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:22,361
I mean, it's not like
I created all this.

812
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:25,530
Did I?

813
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,532
(Crashing)

814
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:37,542
Holy cannoli!

815
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:41,580
- Whoa! You took the words
right out of my mouth!

816
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:46,851
- Whoa...

817
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:48,487
- Oh my gosh...

818
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:51,490
If you weren't with me
this whole time,

819
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:54,326
I would swear
this was your work.

820
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,261
- Well, I make a good mess.

821
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:58,764
And when I say "good",
I mean good!

822
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:00,432
Not this good.

823
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:01,933
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

824
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,968
- Mom! Dad!
- Mom! Dad!

825
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:07,005
- Hey! Oh, we built
the coolest fort!

826
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:08,072
You've gotta see it!

827
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:09,974
- Oh my God,
you gotta check it out!

828
00:37:09,975 --> 00:37:11,510
- They're dressed like kids!

829
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,312
- We missed you,
Mom and Dad!

830
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:14,313
We missed you!

831
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:16,481
- Why do you keep
calling us Mom and Dad?

832
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:17,516
You're the parents.

833
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:19,117
- No, silly, you are!

834
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:20,985
- We're the kids!
- You're the parents!

835
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:22,854
- We're the kids.
You're the parents.

836
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:24,389
- No, I'm telling you!

837
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,492
We're the kids
and you guys are the parents!

838
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:28,794
(Laughing)

839
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:30,195
(Whistling)

840
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:32,631
- They're so weird!
- Wait a minute.

841
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:33,965
- The coolest fort...

842
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:35,166
- If they're the kids,

843
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:38,136
then we should be able to
tell them what to do, right?

844
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:41,272
- I guess so.

845
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:42,774
- (Denise):
You look like a dog!

846
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:43,942
- Robert!

847
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:45,310
(Laughing)

848
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:48,847
Clean up this mess right now.

849
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:50,515
- No! Do we have to?

850
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:51,783
- Yes, you do.

851
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:53,785
- She did it.
- It was his idea.

852
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:56,187
- You know what?
I don't care whose idea it was.

853
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:57,456
- He did it!
- She did!

854
00:37:57,457 --> 00:37:59,624
- I want you to
clean it up right now!

855
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,059
What am I saying?

856
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,961
Denise, you go get me
some popcorn,

857
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:05,063
and, Robert,
you go get me a soda.

858
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:08,367
Let's go! We don't have
all day, people!

859
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:09,568
Let's go!

860
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:11,035
What?

861
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:14,272
- The toilet paper
was Robert's idea.

862
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,144
- Now, this is the life!

863
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:23,782
What are you doing
helping them, Carla?

864
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,183
That's their job!

865
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:29,053
- Have you lost your mind?

866
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:31,022
You're abusing your power!

867
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:32,223
That's not fair!

868
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:35,159
- Don't lecture me about fair,
all right?

869
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,728
This is payback time!

870
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:39,431
They've had this coming
for 10 years now!

871
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:41,466
- Is there anything else
you want us to do?

872
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:44,035
- I finished scrubbing
the toilet with my toothbrush.

873
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:45,069
What now?

874
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,070
- Denise, honey,

875
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:48,306
I'd like you to now
brush your teeth

876
00:38:48,307 --> 00:38:49,608
with that toothbrush.

877
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:51,342
- No!
- But, Dad...

878
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:53,779
- I'm just messing
with you guys!

879
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,946
(Laughing)

880
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:57,015
Now it's playtime!

881
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:59,851
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

882
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:05,690
¶ Today was a fun day ¶

883
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,125
- It's snowing!

884
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,860
¶ Got to do things my way ¶

885
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:12,597
¶ Don't tell me what to do ¶

886
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:15,700
- Ten Mississippi!
Ready or not, here I come!

887
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,803
¶ Got to be a grown-up ¶

888
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:20,038
¶ Got to eat whatever I want ¶

889
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,474
¶ You can't tell me
what to do ¶

890
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:24,776
- I think I'm gonna puke.

891
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:27,813
¶ You'll never know... ¶

892
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:29,781
- I'm only doing
this for you.

893
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:32,016
- Tea? Tea?

894
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:34,553
- I got it!
I got it!

895
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:36,655
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

896
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:38,389
¶ You'll never see ¶

897
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,724
- That was fun!

898
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,660
¶ Just what it means to be... ¶

899
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:43,394
- Just a tip,

900
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,396
but Mom usually
puts it in water.

901
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:47,666
¶ When kids rule ¶

902
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,367
- Dinner's served!

903
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:50,669
Hope you're hungry!

904
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:53,772
- Let me through.

905
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:55,039
Move it, Sammy!

906
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,842
- Stop kicking!

907
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:59,277
- Hey! Wait!

908
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:02,781
We can't let them get into bed
looking like that!

909
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:05,383
- Why not?

910
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:09,654
(Screaming)

911
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:13,291
Hey! Ah, ah, ah!

912
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,292
Not so fast.

913
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:16,862
Aren't we forgetting something?

914
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:21,800
(Insects buzzing, chirping)

915
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:23,635
- Good night, Dad.

916
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:25,971
- Good night.

917
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:30,775
- I miss you, Mom.

918
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:34,445
(Sniffling)

919
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:44,188
You too, Dad.

920
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,658
You too.

921
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:08,146
It's harder than it looks,
being a parent, isn't it?

922
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:10,348
- I don't know about that.

923
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:20,659
- I hope when we wake up
in the morning,

924
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,828
Opposite Day will be over.

925
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:33,071
(Sighs)

926
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:35,907
- I'm sorry for being
such a pain today.

927
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:38,743
(Exhales)

928
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:40,278
Good night.

929
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:50,188
- Wake up, sleepyheads!
- Hey!

930
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:51,890
- Wake up!
Wake up, sleepyhead!

931
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:54,025
Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad!

932
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:55,860
We're hungry!

933
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,428
- Yay!

934
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:58,763
- Again?

935
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:00,565
But we just fed them!

936
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:02,400
- I guess we have
to feed them.

937
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:04,936
- And then after that,
we wanna go to... Ahh!

938
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:06,471
- OK, guys, calm down!
- Ow!

939
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:09,040
- Take a look outside.

940
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,244
Everything's still opposite.

941
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:16,481
- Am I detecting
a change of heart?

942
00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:18,416
- No.

943
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:19,985
I love being in charge.

944
00:42:19,986 --> 00:42:23,488
Besides, it beats the heck
out of going to school!

945
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:24,656
(Doorbell ringing)

946
00:42:24,657 --> 00:42:27,058
- No, I'm not doing anything!
- Stop it!

947
00:42:31,797 --> 00:42:33,131
- Oh, whoa!

948
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:36,501
Girl, you can't do the
presentation looking like that!

949
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:38,837
- I can't do the what?

950
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:41,439
- Somebody call
the fashion police!

951
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,675
- No more police!
Please, no more!

952
00:42:43,676 --> 00:42:45,376
- It's just
an expression, Carla.

953
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:46,477
Chill out.

954
00:42:46,478 --> 00:42:49,080
Now, we have got to do something
about that outfit.

955
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:50,081
Come on, girl.

956
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,922
Whoa, your clothes
are ginormous!

957
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,224
I had that problem
a couple of days ago.

958
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:03,161
Oh, take 'em down to Cuddledyne.
They can fix it.

959
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:06,430
- Sue, has anything seemed to be
a little weird to you

960
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:07,666
these past few days?

961
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,100
- Like what?

962
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:11,136
- Like everything!

963
00:43:11,137 --> 00:43:14,739
- No. But you're kind of
weirding me out right now.

964
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
Get dressed.

965
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,711
- OK, hair.

966
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:21,646
- Your clothes are ginormous.

967
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:24,115
- Makeup. Perfect.

968
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:26,951
What do you think?

969
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:29,120
- I'm embarrassed
to know you.

970
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:30,521
(Car horn honking)

971
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:33,357
But we don't have time.
Let's go.

972
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:34,559
- Hey! This is crazy!

973
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,394
What am I
supposed to do at work?

974
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,697
- Why are you acting
like you've never worked

975
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:39,964
in your life?

976
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,933
- Whoa, where are you going?

977
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,735
- Hello! Earth to Sammy?

978
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:45,737
We're going to the office.

979
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:48,940
Man, you two are totally
out of it today!

980
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:50,608
Come on, let's go.

981
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:52,744
- Bye.
- We've gotta fix this, Sammy!

982
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:54,813
Grandma and Grandpa
are counting on us!

983
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:56,848
- Grandma and Grandpa
are probably having

984
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:58,516
the time of their lives
right now!

985
00:43:58,517 --> 00:44:00,752
- It's jail!
How fun can it be?

986
00:44:00,753 --> 00:44:03,287
¶ ¶ ¶

987
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,457
- You can do it!

988
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,026
- Ah, no, I can't!

989
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:11,629
(Grunting)

990
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:15,366
- Whoo!

991
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:21,505
- Robert, what are you doing?

992
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:24,408
- Ah!

993
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:25,910
I'm sorry, Dad.

994
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:27,578
I'm so sorry.

995
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:30,348
I think I got some cereal
in my pants.

996
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:32,516
- Don't you two
have to go to school?

997
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:35,186
- Um, Dad, I've been
thinking about that,

998
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:36,921
and, um, I don't wanna go.

999
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:39,323
- I'm not asking!
I'm telling!

1000
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:42,593
(Robert grunting)

1001
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:43,594
- Gotcha!

1002
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:45,864
- Hey! Don't make me
come back there!

1003
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:47,498
Now buckle up!

1004
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,938
- (Robert): You stop it!
You stop it! You stop it!

1005
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:56,908
Dad hit the trash cans!

1006
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,244
- (Boy):
Hey, watch it!

1007
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:01,312
- He doesn't know
what he's doing!

1008
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:03,414
(Tires screeching)

1009
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:09,553
- Oh yeah! Wicked!

1010
00:45:09,554 --> 00:45:11,455
We're really moving now!

1011
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:13,792
Jeff Gordon coming through!

1012
00:45:17,897 --> 00:45:19,330
- I said small flathead!

1013
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:21,299
- Yes, sir,
here's the small one.

1014
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,101
- Dad, Dad...

1015
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:25,103
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1016
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:28,572
Would you help me
build my rocket now?

1017
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:30,975
- Not now.
Can't you see I'm working?

1018
00:45:30,976 --> 00:45:31,976
- Oh, come on!

1019
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,979
- Sir, the dispenser units
for the birds

1020
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,414
are ready to be tested.

1021
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:38,482
- Excellent!

1022
00:45:38,483 --> 00:45:41,319
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

1023
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,854
- I don't wanna go!

1024
00:45:42,855 --> 00:45:44,122
- You are going!

1025
00:45:44,123 --> 00:45:45,156
- No!
- Yes!

1026
00:45:45,157 --> 00:45:46,157
- No!
- Yes!

1027
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:47,892
- Why?
- Because I said so.

1028
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:48,893
- OK.

1029
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:57,302
¶ When I was a kid ¶

1030
00:45:57,303 --> 00:45:59,704
¶ I would dream
that I was grown up ¶

1031
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:02,473
¶ Finally on my own ¶

1032
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:04,909
¶ No people to tell me... ¶

1033
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,110
- So, this is work.

1034
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:10,148
- Yup, the place
that pays the bills.

1035
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:11,615
- Pays the what?

1036
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:15,753
- You are totally
out of it today, girl.

1037
00:46:15,754 --> 00:46:18,156
You probably just need
a pick-me-up.

1038
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,858
- A pick-me-what?

1039
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,259
- It's coffee.

1040
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,294
- Who drinks coffee?

1041
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:25,129
- We do. Let's go.

1042
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,031
I'll have a grande
vanilla mocha-choco

1043
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:28,532
sugar-free nonfat
choco-latte,

1044
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:32,136
extra hot, over ice with
whipped cream and sprinkles.

1045
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:34,538
Oh, and do you have
goat's milk?

1046
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:36,341
- Sorry. Fresh out.

1047
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:39,310
- I'll have soy then.
She'll have the same.

1048
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:40,945
Blended.

1049
00:46:40,946 --> 00:46:42,280
- Ew!

1050
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:43,547
- It's our usual!

1051
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,318
Hi.

1052
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:49,320
(Elevator bell dings)

1053
00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:59,063
- Matthew, stop it!

1054
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:00,064
- Nice one!

1055
00:47:00,065 --> 00:47:01,799
- Don't encourage him!

1056
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,935
We're late enough as it is.

1057
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:06,404
(Sighs)

1058
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:08,606
- Copycat Ad Agency,
may I please help you?

1059
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:11,042
- Copycat Ad Agency,
may I please help you?

1060
00:47:11,043 --> 00:47:12,377
- Copycat Ad Agency...

1061
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:13,978
- I've been late
twice this week,

1062
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:15,280
and Reynolds
is all over me!

1063
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:16,480
- Who's Reynolds?

1064
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:17,782
- Your boss!

1065
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:21,386
- Did you rob a circus clown?

1066
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:22,620
- No.

1067
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:24,422
- Is this
the new summer fashion?

1068
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:26,524
- Actually, it's my mom's.

1069
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:27,725
- Whatever.

1070
00:47:27,726 --> 00:47:29,227
Come on!

1071
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:33,031
This is the only
original we have,

1072
00:47:33,032 --> 00:47:35,433
so guard it with your life.

1073
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,268
I need you to make
20 copies, collated.

1074
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:39,537
Double side the bottom half
in black and white,

1075
00:47:39,538 --> 00:47:41,439
then single side
the top half in colour.

1076
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,774
Fax it as an attachment
to the client's FTP site.

1077
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:45,676
Paperclip the hard copy,
then staple it.

1078
00:47:45,677 --> 00:47:47,078
You know what?

1079
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,147
I really don't care.

1080
00:47:57,556 --> 00:48:00,258
- Ugh! The plug!

1081
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:16,707
- We decided,
for your new moisturizer,

1082
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,609
we would have to
come up with the best,

1083
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,743
'cause you are
the best.

1084
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:21,245
- Well, I'm expecting the best.

1085
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:27,651
- Come on,
I just wanna be a friend.

1086
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,757
You look like
a nicer copy machine.

1087
00:48:33,758 --> 00:48:36,027
Let's try you out.

1088
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:38,262
Come on.

1089
00:48:38,263 --> 00:48:40,965
Oh no, it's a shredder! No!

1090
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:42,633
Oh! Bad shredder!

1091
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:44,302
Spit it out!

1092
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,805
- The clients are here!

1093
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:50,041
Grab the presentation!

1094
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,110
Hurry up!

1095
00:48:52,111 --> 00:48:53,611
Come on, let's go!

1096
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:54,912
- One sec.

1097
00:48:57,449 --> 00:48:58,983
- Let's go.

1098
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:01,852
- Mostly sunny skies today with
a light east-coming breeze.

1099
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:02,987
Expect temperatures...

1100
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:07,725
- Hey, hey,
you wanna shoot some hoops?

1101
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:10,794
- Sorry, pal, I have to
deliver the US mail.

1102
00:49:22,641 --> 00:49:25,410
- Hey, guys, wanna play
some basketball?

1103
00:49:25,411 --> 00:49:28,379
- Can't. We're on duty.

1104
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:36,521
- D7...

1105
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:41,225
G4...

1106
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:43,594
Boom! Gotcha!

1107
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:49,434
- You want to play?
Let's play.

1108
00:50:10,722 --> 00:50:12,490
(Bells jingling)

1109
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,568
- You should slow down, pal.

1110
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:24,868
- After this one,

1111
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:27,638
I never wanna see
another malt again.

1112
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:29,574
- You off work today?

1113
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:32,042
- Today and every day.

1114
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:33,444
- You got family?

1115
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:35,045
A wife?

1116
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:36,614
- Yeah.

1117
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:38,015
I guess so.

1118
00:50:38,016 --> 00:50:40,050
Wife and kids.

1119
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,820
The whole shebang.

1120
00:50:45,257 --> 00:50:48,593
- Aren't they the most
adorable kids you ever saw?

1121
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:51,362
- Yeah, they're just darling.

1122
00:50:52,598 --> 00:50:55,133
- Unbelievable
how fast they grow up.

1123
00:50:55,134 --> 00:50:57,067
Never fast enough for them.

1124
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:58,936
That was my problem.

1125
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:02,340
I wanted to be an adult,
so I didn't enjoy my childhood.

1126
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:04,242
Didn't make the moments count.

1127
00:51:04,243 --> 00:51:06,010
Didn't listen to my parents.

1128
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:08,712
I became a pretty mixed-up kid.

1129
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:12,716
Boy, wish I could
turn back the years.

1130
00:51:12,717 --> 00:51:14,619
You know what I mean?

1131
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:24,895
- Yeah.

1132
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:26,997
I know exactly what you mean.

1133
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:29,467
I've gotta
turn things right again.

1134
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:31,169
How much are the malts?

1135
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,570
- They're always
on the house.

1136
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:38,342
- I'm Dr. Chaz Larabee.

1137
00:51:38,343 --> 00:51:39,343
- Chaz?

1138
00:51:39,344 --> 00:51:41,945
- I'm the best friend
you could ask for.

1139
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:44,148
- Can you turn it up, please?

1140
00:51:44,149 --> 00:51:47,218
- Does the world around you
seem larger lately?

1141
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:49,753
Can't seem to reach
the pedal anymore?

1142
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:52,723
Trying to find answers
for the unexplainable?

1143
00:51:52,724 --> 00:51:56,227
Come on down to Cuddledyne
and see me, Dr. Chaz Larabee.

1144
00:51:56,228 --> 00:51:58,296
We don't just
fix your clothes.

1145
00:51:58,297 --> 00:51:59,730
We fix your life.

1146
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:01,365
Ha-ha! Cuddledyne.

1147
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:04,202
- Thanks again!

1148
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:05,436
- No pressure,

1149
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:09,139
but the future of the firm
depends on your presentation.

1150
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:21,452
- I love your dress.

1151
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:22,920
It's so big.

1152
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,388
Where'd you get it?

1153
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:26,224
- My mom's closet.

1154
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:28,926
- Never heard of it.
Is that a new store?

1155
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:30,127
(Clears throat)

1156
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,129
- Let's get started,
shall we?

1157
00:52:33,832 --> 00:52:35,633
Our research shows that

1158
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:39,604
80% of women prefer smooth skin
to dry, scaly skin.

1159
00:52:39,605 --> 00:52:41,505
And that, in a nutshell,

1160
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:44,375
is the demographic
we're going after:

1161
00:52:44,376 --> 00:52:46,944
savvy women
who like smooth skin.

1162
00:52:46,945 --> 00:52:49,780
- Carla's gonna distribute
a mock-up print ad

1163
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:51,382
for your new moisturizer.

1164
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:54,051
- Um...

1165
00:52:54,052 --> 00:52:55,553
yeah!

1166
00:52:57,289 --> 00:52:58,822
OK...

1167
00:53:05,364 --> 00:53:07,732
Could you just
pass this around?

1168
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:08,733
Thanks.

1169
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:18,509
- This is a copy
of somebody's bottom.

1170
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:20,077
- And where's the slogan?

1171
00:53:20,078 --> 00:53:22,713
You were supposed to
come up with a slogan!

1172
00:53:22,714 --> 00:53:24,114
"Smooth..."

1173
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:25,949
- Um...

1174
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,385
right!

1175
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:30,788
"Smooth...

1176
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:35,058
"Smooth...

1177
00:53:36,295 --> 00:53:37,895
"bottom...

1178
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,935
"Smooth as a baby's bottom."

1179
00:53:50,175 --> 00:53:51,509
- Spot on!

1180
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,178
- I love it.
It's so fresh!

1181
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,847
- You're in!

1182
00:53:56,848 --> 00:53:58,749
- (Boy):
Yeah, fantastic!

1183
00:54:04,255 --> 00:54:06,156
- Look at the world
I am creating.

1184
00:54:06,157 --> 00:54:07,558
I'll use my father's idea

1185
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,860
of the overnight-delivery
Bird Express.

1186
00:54:09,861 --> 00:54:12,095
And I will use these birds
to fly to

1187
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:13,664
London, France and New York

1188
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:17,000
to carry the mist which will
change everyone's personality

1189
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:21,639
and put the kids
in charge everywhere.

1190
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,507
- Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

1191
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:31,582
(Students grunting)

1192
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,187
- Hey, how much
would it cost

1193
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:39,990
for me to hire
you and your ninjas

1194
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,959
as my elite bodyguards?

1195
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,562
- Hey, Mom, look what
he's doing to my hair!

1196
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:47,064
(Robert shouting)

1197
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:49,032
- Guys, we need to talk.

1198
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:50,334
- (Denise): Go higher!

1199
00:54:50,335 --> 00:54:51,602
- I've been thinking.

1200
00:54:51,603 --> 00:54:54,872
I need to explain to you
what's happened to everyone.

1201
00:54:54,873 --> 00:54:56,940
- Alexei, there is
no sign of reversal.

1202
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:59,009
The outcome could have
not been better.

1203
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,245
- Hurry up!
- I'll be there in one second!

1204
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:04,314
All the kids have taken on
the lives of their parents.

1205
00:55:04,315 --> 00:55:06,384
I want you to
speed up the operation.

1206
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:07,951
We go hot today!

1207
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:10,721
The birds must be ready
to fly immediately!

1208
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:12,790
- What are you up to,
Chaz-mataz?

1209
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:15,493
- Mistify the whole world
so the kids can be in charge!

1210
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:17,428
Sorry.

1211
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:18,829
- You can't
keep doing this.

1212
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,365
It's not fair
to your boy or me.

1213
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:23,501
- I'll be on time next week.

1214
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:24,502
Let's go.

1215
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,574
Make sure that all the jetpacks
are filled with the mist

1216
00:55:30,575 --> 00:55:32,276
and secured perfectly
on each bird

1217
00:55:32,277 --> 00:55:33,411
and ready for takeoff.

1218
00:55:33,412 --> 00:55:36,547
- On second thought,
we'll talk later.

1219
00:55:36,548 --> 00:55:38,181
Come with me, guys.

1220
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:40,885
- Come on.
Give me my backpack!

1221
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:42,252
- Dad, run through the gate.

1222
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:44,021
- Godfrey, be on
your best behaviour

1223
00:55:44,022 --> 00:55:45,423
and I'll give you ice cream.

1224
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:47,224
Open it, Joey.

1225
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:50,260
- Run! Run through the gate!
Run through the gate!

1226
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:53,030
Run through the gate!
Run through the gate!

1227
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:58,268
- Dad, I wanna go
see a movie.

1228
00:55:58,269 --> 00:56:01,839
- Oh yeah, I wanna see
the one about the flying saucer.

1229
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,341
- Uh, we'll go tomorrow.
I promise.

1230
00:56:04,342 --> 00:56:06,544
We'll do a double feature, OK?

1231
00:56:10,248 --> 00:56:11,749
- Can I help you?

1232
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,318
- We're here for
the, um... We're...

1233
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,653
- Afternoon tour!

1234
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:17,455
- Ah, how'd you guess?

1235
00:56:17,456 --> 00:56:20,157
- My wife says
I have psychic abilities.

1236
00:56:20,158 --> 00:56:21,258
Go straight.

1237
00:56:21,259 --> 00:56:22,292
- Right.

1238
00:56:22,293 --> 00:56:24,528
- Make your first right.
- Uh-huh.

1239
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,434
- Daycare's first door
on your left.

1240
00:56:30,435 --> 00:56:31,502
- Thanks.

1241
00:56:31,503 --> 00:56:32,636
(Exhales)

1242
00:56:32,637 --> 00:56:35,005
- All right, I'm gonna
tell you the story now.

1243
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:37,074
Be a little quiet now.

1244
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:41,078
- Regrettably, Dr. Larabee's
unable to join us

1245
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:43,146
on our tour today.

1246
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:45,415
So let's get started.

1247
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:48,318
Five years ago, looking to
branch out from their roots

1248
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,354
as a space-technologies company,

1249
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:53,824
Cuddledyne introduced
their first baby product:

1250
00:56:53,825 --> 00:56:57,094
the GPS pacifier,

1251
00:56:57,095 --> 00:57:01,732
which allowed parents to easily
locate the missing sucker.

1252
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:05,369
We're moving.
We're moving.

1253
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,137
(Sammy groaning)

1254
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:41,572
- (Chaz): Just be aware
that all jetpacks

1255
00:57:41,573 --> 00:57:44,675
have been filled with mist
and are fully operational.

1256
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:47,011
Handle with care
when attaching to the birds.

1257
00:57:47,012 --> 00:57:49,346
First launching
is in 15 minutes.

1258
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:53,350
- What'd you want me
to change?

1259
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:54,552
- Cover the D and the E.

1260
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:57,354
Starting now, this bad boy
shall be known as the Mistifier.

1261
00:57:57,355 --> 00:57:58,989
- Nice!

1262
00:58:01,392 --> 00:58:04,294
- Give me my update, Alexei.

1263
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,331
- Two-thirds of
the supersonic jetpacks

1264
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:10,100
have been attached
to the birds.

1265
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:13,971
The first of the fleet are
ready for takeoff as planned.

1266
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:15,005
- Brilliant, Alexei!

1267
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:17,240
We're so close,
I can practically taste it!

1268
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:20,010
At midnight tonight,
my birds will Mistify the world,

1269
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:21,612
and children everywhere

1270
00:58:21,613 --> 00:58:24,014
will rule adults
once and for all!

1271
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:25,382
The best part is,

1272
00:58:25,383 --> 00:58:27,250
no one can stop me!

1273
00:58:29,353 --> 00:58:30,520
Thank you!

1274
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:31,889
Get back to work!

1275
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:39,063
- The opposite
will last forever!

1276
00:58:41,265 --> 00:58:42,265
- What is it?

1277
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:44,301
- Intruder in Sector B!
- No!

1278
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:47,370
Sir, we've got
a security breach.

1279
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:50,074
- Are you trying to ruin
my moment of glory?

1280
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:52,710
- No, sir, I just
wanted to inform you

1281
00:58:52,711 --> 00:58:55,679
that I've got the situation
under control.

1282
00:58:57,816 --> 00:59:00,884
- This isn't a playground.
- It is now!

1283
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:17,467
- I'm the King.
You're the peasant!

1284
00:59:17,468 --> 00:59:19,903
(All chattering)

1285
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:21,972
- And they lived
happily every after!

1286
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:24,508
Come on, kids, let's go!
- Where are we going?

1287
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:26,409
- Out of here!
- Go, go, go!

1288
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,245
(Tires screeching)

1289
00:59:28,246 --> 00:59:29,980
- Help!

1290
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:32,950
- You're the worst driver
I've ever seen!

1291
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:39,657
- (Denise):
Dad, did you do something wrong?

1292
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:46,329
- No, Dad, don't!

1293
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,165
(Screaming)

1294
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:52,670
- Oh... we lost him.

1295
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,038
- Sammy!

1296
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,774
(Door opening)

1297
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:57,975
- (Robert):
Na, na, na!

1298
00:59:57,976 --> 00:59:59,043
(Panting)

1299
00:59:59,044 --> 01:00:01,945
- You're never gonna believe
where I was today!

1300
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:03,213
- What is it, Sammy?

1301
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:04,314
- I ran into Chaz.

1302
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:06,616
He was blabbering about
kids controlling adults

1303
01:00:06,617 --> 01:00:08,385
and he has this
evil army of birds...

1304
01:00:08,386 --> 01:00:12,289
- Wait! Slow down for a second.

1305
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,792
- By the way,
nice job with the house.

1306
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:15,793
It looks great.

1307
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:17,027
- Dinner's ready now.

1308
01:00:17,028 --> 01:00:19,730
We're having chicken tenders
and French fries.

1309
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:22,532
- Yo, Martha Stewart,
what'd you do with my sister?

1310
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:25,002
- I'm getting the hang
of this "parents" thing.

1311
01:00:25,003 --> 01:00:27,504
- Oh yeah, about that,
I ran into Chaz--

1312
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:29,439
- You think quiet little Chaz

1313
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,309
has something to do
with this opposite mess?

1314
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:33,476
- That's just it!

1315
01:00:33,477 --> 01:00:35,713
He's not quiet
little Chaz anymore!

1316
01:00:35,714 --> 01:00:37,881
I followed him back
to this laboratory,

1317
01:00:37,882 --> 01:00:39,482
and he's turned evil, Carla.

1318
01:00:39,483 --> 01:00:41,985
He's planning to do
what he did to our town,

1319
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,021
except to all over the world!

1320
01:00:44,022 --> 01:00:47,657
- I thought you loved this!
This was your dream come true!

1321
01:00:47,658 --> 01:00:49,526
- I'm not so sure anymore.

1322
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,628
Being in charge is hard work.

1323
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:54,397
And please don't say
"I told you so."

1324
01:00:54,398 --> 01:00:56,066
- I told you so!
- Mom!

1325
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:57,367
Can I ask you a question?

1326
01:00:57,368 --> 01:00:58,568
- What is it?

1327
01:00:58,569 --> 01:01:00,403
- Is it OK
if we watch cartoons?

1328
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:01,605
- Not now, honey.

1329
01:01:01,606 --> 01:01:03,573
- We've gotta go to the police!

1330
01:01:03,574 --> 01:01:06,243
- But who's going to
look after the kids?

1331
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:08,545
- Ahh!
- We need a babysitter.

1332
01:01:08,546 --> 01:01:10,347
(Doorbell ringing)

1333
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:12,349
Hello! Thank you for coming.

1334
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:21,491
- What are you guys
doing here again?

1335
01:01:21,492 --> 01:01:23,426
- A few days ago,
something happened.

1336
01:01:23,427 --> 01:01:26,296
A machine in Cuddledyne
Laboratories turned everyone--

1337
01:01:26,297 --> 01:01:27,564
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1338
01:01:27,565 --> 01:01:28,932
Let's move this over here.

1339
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:34,271
(Cartoons playing on TV)

1340
01:01:34,272 --> 01:01:36,373
- Bring them to me.

1341
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:43,947
- And we have until midnight
tonight to stop the birds,

1342
01:01:43,948 --> 01:01:46,183
or the whole world
will be Mistified.

1343
01:01:48,253 --> 01:01:49,953
Come on, hurry!

1344
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:55,458
(Cricket chirping)

1345
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,801
- Can I help you?

1346
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:04,802
- Police business.

1347
01:02:04,803 --> 01:02:06,703
- Straight through, Officer.
- Thanks.

1348
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:11,441
- They're here.

1349
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:13,743
- Your transmit is operational.

1350
01:02:13,744 --> 01:02:15,112
- Where's Chaz?

1351
01:02:16,114 --> 01:02:18,115
- Hello, Sammy, Carla.

1352
01:02:18,116 --> 01:02:20,083
You were in
the neighbourhood?

1353
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:21,484
- It's over, Chaz.

1354
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:24,822
I told Jasper all about
your evil plans.

1355
01:02:24,823 --> 01:02:27,090
- I'm not gonna
deny it, everyone.

1356
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,626
I'm an evil,
evil little villain.

1357
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:31,494
And I should be stopped.

1358
01:02:31,495 --> 01:02:34,431
Someone, arrest me, please!

1359
01:02:34,432 --> 01:02:36,366
- You heard him, Jasper.

1360
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:38,168
Arrest him!

1361
01:02:38,169 --> 01:02:39,336
- (Sammy):
Yeah!

1362
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:43,140
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!

1363
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:44,942
- I should be stopped.

1364
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:48,145
And fortunately for me,
today's not that day.

1365
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:49,313
- Traitor!

1366
01:02:49,314 --> 01:02:51,048
- How could you
do this to us?

1367
01:02:51,049 --> 01:02:52,782
- Chaz is right.

1368
01:02:52,783 --> 01:02:55,986
It's kids' time to rule!

1369
01:02:55,987 --> 01:02:57,888
- Why fight us
when you can join us?

1370
01:02:57,889 --> 01:02:59,990
- So we can act
like boring grown-ups?

1371
01:02:59,991 --> 01:03:03,227
- When Chaz told me
about adults becoming kids

1372
01:03:03,228 --> 01:03:04,494
and kids becoming adults,

1373
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:06,063
I didn't believe him.

1374
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:10,200
But when he proved it to me,
that it actually happened,

1375
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:11,201
I realized,

1376
01:03:11,202 --> 01:03:13,403
this is the way
the world should be.

1377
01:03:13,404 --> 01:03:15,705
Kids rule!

1378
01:03:15,706 --> 01:03:16,940
- With kids in charge,

1379
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:19,343
there'll be no more war
and no more famine.

1380
01:03:19,344 --> 01:03:21,478
We'll use the power
of our collective minds

1381
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:24,147
to find solutions to
make the world a better place.

1382
01:03:24,148 --> 01:03:25,682
We can take care of our parents

1383
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:27,717
better than
they've ever dreamt of!

1384
01:03:27,718 --> 01:03:31,054
This is our time
to shine, Sammy.

1385
01:03:31,055 --> 01:03:32,356
- You're wrong, Chaz.

1386
01:03:32,357 --> 01:03:34,457
We don't need
that responsibility.

1387
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,059
We just need our parents.

1388
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,529
- Oh, what do you know!
You've got them.

1389
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,564
- (Both):
Mom! Dad!

1390
01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:44,434
- I see that we have
a little family reunion.

1391
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:46,336
- I've gotta get back
to the station.

1392
01:03:46,337 --> 01:03:48,005
- Jasper!

1393
01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:51,441
They didn't do
anything to you!

1394
01:03:51,442 --> 01:03:53,277
- Let them go!

1395
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:55,045
- I fully intend to
release you all.

1396
01:03:55,046 --> 01:03:56,413
Once you've been Mistified.

1397
01:03:56,414 --> 01:03:57,614
One breath of this mist,

1398
01:03:57,615 --> 01:04:00,850
and you'll forget that
grown-up parents ever existed.

1399
01:04:00,851 --> 01:04:02,886
You'll be just like
the rest of us:

1400
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:04,521
small and on top of it all.

1401
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:06,924
- You realize you're tampering
with Mother Nature?

1402
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:08,591
- Ah, yeah,
I hate to say this,

1403
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:10,961
but I like to call it
Daughter Nature now.

1404
01:04:10,962 --> 01:04:12,195
- Kids all over the world

1405
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:13,997
will be missing
something so special

1406
01:04:13,998 --> 01:04:15,432
if you go through with this!

1407
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:16,900
- Write a book about it.

1408
01:04:16,901 --> 01:04:18,601
Place them
in the Mistifier.

1409
01:04:18,602 --> 01:04:20,703
- Come on! Move along!

1410
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:23,473
- (Carla): You'll never
get away with this!

1411
01:04:23,474 --> 01:04:25,042
- Let go!

1412
01:04:36,955 --> 01:04:38,721
- Dad... Dad!

1413
01:04:38,722 --> 01:04:40,757
- What is it this time, Godfrey?

1414
01:04:40,758 --> 01:04:43,093
- You wanna help me
build my rocket?

1415
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:45,495
- As usual,
your timing is horrible.

1416
01:04:45,496 --> 01:04:47,530
(Shouting)

1417
01:04:50,335 --> 01:04:52,970
- Peripheral nervous system
activated.

1418
01:04:52,971 --> 01:04:53,971
- Alexei!

1419
01:04:55,206 --> 01:04:56,840
- Yes, Doctor?

1420
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:59,977
- I am trusting you to finish
the Mistification process

1421
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:01,044
of the Benson family.

1422
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:02,245
- Yes, sir.

1423
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:04,948
- I have some birds
to attend to.

1424
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:12,155
- (Carla): Chaz! Don't do this!
- Let us out!

1425
01:05:12,156 --> 01:05:15,425
(Grunting)

1426
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:20,430
- March forth,
my bird-brain friends.

1427
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:21,999
Spread the word!

1428
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,001
Demistify the world!

1429
01:05:24,002 --> 01:05:26,003
You are the last
of my warriors!

1430
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:27,937
Together, we will make history!

1431
01:05:27,938 --> 01:05:29,873
Together...

1432
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:32,342
we'll change this world.

1433
01:05:32,343 --> 01:05:35,345
Kids in charge everywhere!

1434
01:05:35,346 --> 01:05:36,946
Fly!

1435
01:05:36,947 --> 01:05:38,581
Fly!

1436
01:05:38,582 --> 01:05:39,949
Fly!

1437
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:42,552
Fly!

1438
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,491
Fly!

1439
01:05:51,562 --> 01:05:53,763
- Countdown to Mistification.

1440
01:05:54,765 --> 01:05:56,366
20, 19...

1441
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:57,667
- Help!

1442
01:05:57,668 --> 01:05:59,836
- 18, 17...

1443
01:05:59,837 --> 01:06:03,073
16, 15...

1444
01:06:03,074 --> 01:06:04,474
14, 13...

1445
01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:06,209
- Help!

1446
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,845
- No one's gonna mess
with my parents!

1447
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:10,247
- (Carla): Dad!

1448
01:06:10,248 --> 01:06:12,849
- My nose! It hurts!
- Oh no, Dad!

1449
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,684
- 7...

1450
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:17,921
- Dr. Larabee's
not going to be happy!

1451
01:06:17,922 --> 01:06:18,988
- 4...

1452
01:06:18,989 --> 01:06:20,924
(Alarm blaring)

1453
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:22,426
- Yeah!
- That's my dad!

1454
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:24,761
- Mistification protocol
interrupted.

1455
01:06:24,762 --> 01:06:26,596
Malfunction.

1456
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:28,731
- Cool!
- I picked them first!

1457
01:06:28,732 --> 01:06:29,832
- No! I did!

1458
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:32,702
- No way! You only want them
'cause I want them!

1459
01:06:32,703 --> 01:06:34,271
- Whoa! You take 'em!

1460
01:06:34,272 --> 01:06:35,572
Go! Turn!

1461
01:06:40,178 --> 01:06:43,046
- I know this isn't the time
to get all mushy on you, Sammy,

1462
01:06:43,047 --> 01:06:45,315
but even though
I give you a hard time,

1463
01:06:45,316 --> 01:06:47,350
I'm proud to have you
as my brother.

1464
01:06:48,586 --> 01:06:51,688
- You really mean that?
- Of course I do!

1465
01:06:51,689 --> 01:06:52,722
- Thanks!

1466
01:06:52,723 --> 01:06:56,025
For a girl, you're
a pretty cool sister, too.

1467
01:06:57,261 --> 01:06:59,028
- We don't have
much time left!

1468
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:01,531
It's almost midnight.

1469
01:07:01,532 --> 01:07:03,733
We have to make
everything opposite again!

1470
01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:05,502
- We need to
reverse the Mistifier

1471
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:07,070
and get things
back to normal.

1472
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:09,806
Uh, you go that way,
and I'll go that way, OK?

1473
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:11,241
- You got it!

1474
01:07:11,242 --> 01:07:12,875
- All right, uh...

1475
01:07:12,876 --> 01:07:14,777
you two, stay here!

1476
01:07:16,747 --> 01:07:18,815
- The Bensons have escaped.

1477
01:07:22,686 --> 01:07:25,188
- Send in the ninjas.

1478
01:07:27,592 --> 01:07:29,459
- Chaz!

1479
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,561
(Beeping)

1480
01:07:35,966 --> 01:07:37,134
(Grunting)

1481
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:39,102
- Hi-yah!

1482
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:44,307
(Beeping intensifies)

1483
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:47,076
- Kind of spooky in here.

1484
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:50,147
- Wanna play?
Let's play!

1485
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:51,648
Hoo! Ha!

1486
01:07:53,284 --> 01:07:55,152
(Beeping)

1487
01:07:56,154 --> 01:07:57,787
¶ Standing in a corner ¶

1488
01:07:57,788 --> 01:08:01,758
¶ Feeling like I ought to know ¶

1489
01:08:01,759 --> 01:08:03,326
¶ Better ¶

1490
01:08:03,327 --> 01:08:04,927
¶ I never should have told you ¶

1491
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:07,264
¶ How to win me over ¶

1492
01:08:07,265 --> 01:08:10,634
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

1493
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:12,602
¶ Shake on you ¶

1494
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:16,640
¶ Always blaming me ¶

1495
01:08:16,641 --> 01:08:19,876
¶ It's the both of us ¶

1496
01:08:19,877 --> 01:08:24,214
¶ Can I make you see? ¶

1497
01:08:24,215 --> 01:08:26,383
¶ You got me wrapped
around your finger ¶

1498
01:08:26,384 --> 01:08:28,785
¶ I can't focus on
a single other thing ¶

1499
01:08:28,786 --> 01:08:31,521
¶ When I'm with you ¶

1500
01:08:31,522 --> 01:08:34,057
¶ If this is your take
on reality... ¶

1501
01:08:34,058 --> 01:08:36,092
(Grunting)

1502
01:08:37,795 --> 01:08:41,298
¶ How can you help me?
How can heal me? ¶

1503
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:42,499
¶ You're never home ¶

1504
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,467
- These things are dangerous!

1505
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:46,102
(Exhales)

1506
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,941
(¶ Rock on headphones ¶)

1507
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:58,315
- I'm not cleaning this up!

1508
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:01,718
- Ten minutes and counting

1509
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:04,287
until mist release
over global targets.

1510
01:09:04,288 --> 01:09:06,789
First fleet approaching
targeted area.

1511
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:12,161
- So predictable!

1512
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,666
- Ow!

1513
01:09:20,003 --> 01:09:21,338
- Such a shame.

1514
01:09:21,339 --> 01:09:24,474
You're just a tad too slow.

1515
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:35,252
Flight attendants,

1516
01:09:35,253 --> 01:09:38,321
please prepare for arrival.

1517
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:43,025
(Laughs)

1518
01:09:43,026 --> 01:09:45,962
- Nine minutes
until bird fleet...

1519
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:48,197
(Laughing)

1520
01:09:52,637 --> 01:09:54,804
- And now for
my next experiment,

1521
01:09:54,805 --> 01:09:57,540
I believe I figured out
how to make a kid fly!

1522
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,548
You couldn't just let me be!
You had to play hero!

1523
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:08,752
Well, I'm sorry to say
that your heroics

1524
01:10:08,753 --> 01:10:11,288
have come to
a rather slow stop.

1525
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:13,156
Any final thoughts?

1526
01:10:13,157 --> 01:10:15,725
- I...

1527
01:10:15,726 --> 01:10:18,395
- Ugh, email me
when you're done.

1528
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:24,100
- We have to get
everybody in Fairfield

1529
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:25,101
back to normal!

1530
01:10:25,102 --> 01:10:26,469
We've got to stop Chaz!

1531
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,104
I don't know the password!

1532
01:10:28,105 --> 01:10:29,706
- You can do it!

1533
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:32,642
- I don't know the password
to start this thing!

1534
01:10:32,643 --> 01:10:34,944
- Do you want me
to smash it, Ma?

1535
01:10:34,945 --> 01:10:36,379
- Yes.

1536
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,014
But no.

1537
01:10:38,015 --> 01:10:40,183
- I saw the buttons
that my dad pushed

1538
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:41,551
to make that thing work.

1539
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:43,219
- You remember them?

1540
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,955
- Yeah, it's the same word
as that right there.

1541
01:10:45,956 --> 01:10:48,425
- The password is "password"?
- Yeah.

1542
01:10:48,426 --> 01:10:51,928
- Eight minutes until
birds over targeted areas

1543
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:53,095
and mist released.

1544
01:10:53,096 --> 01:10:55,932
Login successful.

1545
01:10:57,301 --> 01:11:00,837
- Ah! It's working!
It's working!

1546
01:11:00,838 --> 01:11:02,539
Whoo!

1547
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,740
I did it!

1548
01:11:05,142 --> 01:11:06,609
- Malfunction.

1549
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:13,850
- OK, sorry, Sammy,
but this is just so annoying.

1550
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:18,621
Time is up.

1551
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:19,689
- Give me it!

1552
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,057
Give me that thing!

1553
01:11:21,058 --> 01:11:22,959
- Carla!
- Sammy!

1554
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:28,531
- Wait! You can't do this!

1555
01:11:28,532 --> 01:11:30,600
- Give me one good reason
why not.

1556
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:33,269
- You may not remember this,

1557
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,204
but you used to
like your dad, Chaz.

1558
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:36,539
You were just upset

1559
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,708
because he didn't
spend enough time with you.

1560
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:40,577
- What good
does that do me now?

1561
01:11:40,578 --> 01:11:43,413
- There are so many
wonderful things

1562
01:11:43,414 --> 01:11:45,482
parents do for their kids,

1563
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:48,251
things that
kids can never replace.

1564
01:11:48,252 --> 01:11:49,686
- Like what?

1565
01:11:49,687 --> 01:11:51,921
(Sighs)

1566
01:11:51,922 --> 01:11:54,190
- Well, without parents,

1567
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:56,959
who will tuck us in at night?

1568
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,928
Who will make us dinner?

1569
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:01,330
Who will show us new things?

1570
01:12:01,331 --> 01:12:03,700
Or teach us right from wrong?

1571
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:06,335
Or take care of us
when we don't feel good?

1572
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:09,338
Who will give us
hugs and kisses?

1573
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:14,176
Parents are our teachers,

1574
01:12:14,177 --> 01:12:15,978
our guardians.

1575
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,449
They look after us...

1576
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:21,150
and love us...

1577
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,253
unconditionally.

1578
01:12:24,254 --> 01:12:27,657
- We have our whole lives
to act like adults,

1579
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,459
so why rush growing up?

1580
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,462
Your dad cares about you
more than you think, Chaz.

1581
01:12:32,463 --> 01:12:33,897
Why else would he bring you

1582
01:12:33,898 --> 01:12:36,232
those boxes of
caramel corn every day?

1583
01:12:37,568 --> 01:12:39,235
- He brings them...

1584
01:12:39,236 --> 01:12:40,236
(Groans)

1585
01:12:40,237 --> 01:12:43,072
...because he knows
they're my favourite.

1586
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:46,609
He used to tuck me
into bed at night.

1587
01:12:52,215 --> 01:12:54,016
I'm sorry.

1588
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:56,619
I can't believe
how selfish I've been.

1589
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,021
I... I just wanted to be loved.

1590
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,958
- It's OK, Chaz.

1591
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:04,427
You haven't been
yourself these days.

1592
01:13:04,428 --> 01:13:07,530
- Chaz, we gotta turn
everybody back into normal

1593
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:09,031
and get the birds back.

1594
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,736
- Six minutes until birds
over targeted areas

1595
01:13:13,737 --> 01:13:15,071
and mist released.

1596
01:13:15,072 --> 01:13:17,106
Malfunction.

1597
01:13:17,107 --> 01:13:19,342
- Ah, it's jammed!
- So, what do we do?

1598
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:21,778
- We gotta rewire the circuitry
and override it.

1599
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:24,447
Dad! I mean, Godfrey!

1600
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:26,683
I need your strength!

1601
01:13:26,684 --> 01:13:28,485
- Me?
- Yeah, just come on.

1602
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:31,320
- Robert, Denise, over here.
- Come on, guys!

1603
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:33,490
- (Denise): What do I do?
Can I help?

1604
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:34,891
- (Godfrey): Ow!

1605
01:13:34,892 --> 01:13:37,360
- All right,
now pull that off.

1606
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:38,661
- Me?

1607
01:13:38,662 --> 01:13:40,697
- Yeah, yeah,
just pull it off.

1608
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:43,867
You know what?
Just break it off.

1609
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:45,935
- You know,
I'm afraid of breaking it.

1610
01:13:45,936 --> 01:13:47,971
- (All):
Break it!

1611
01:13:47,972 --> 01:13:50,272
- ...targeted areas
and mist released.

1612
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:54,043
- All right, now pull
these 2 wires out

1613
01:13:54,044 --> 01:13:55,812
and push them together.

1614
01:13:59,016 --> 01:14:00,182
You ready, Son?

1615
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:01,951
- Ready!
- Now!

1616
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,854
- Ahh!

1617
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:19,235
- My brain hurts.

1618
01:14:20,738 --> 01:14:21,804
- Where are we?

1619
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:23,439
- What's with my hair?

1620
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,807
- Look at my shirt!

1621
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,876
- (Both):
Mom! Dad!

1622
01:14:26,877 --> 01:14:29,012
- There you are!
- I missed you guys so much!

1623
01:14:29,013 --> 01:14:31,915
- We'll never
take you for granted.

1624
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:34,717
- I realize now how hard
you guys have to work for us

1625
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:36,519
and all the things
you have to do.

1626
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,854
Know that I love you guys

1627
01:14:37,855 --> 01:14:39,822
more than anything else
in the world.

1628
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:42,692
- You took the words
right out of my mouth!

1629
01:14:42,693 --> 01:14:44,260
- I love you!
- Wow!

1630
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:45,695
That is some kind of a hug!

1631
01:14:45,696 --> 01:14:47,931
Are you sure I'm not
gonna embarrass you?

1632
01:14:47,932 --> 01:14:50,867
I know it's not cool being seen
hugging your old man.

1633
01:14:50,868 --> 01:14:53,169
- Dad, it's totally cool!

1634
01:14:54,672 --> 01:14:56,573
(Laughing)

1635
01:14:56,574 --> 01:14:59,842
- Come here, my boy.
Come here. Oh!

1636
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:02,378
Oh, Chaz, I am so sorry.

1637
01:15:02,379 --> 01:15:04,747
You know, I've been
looking for a rainbow

1638
01:15:04,748 --> 01:15:06,749
not realizing
that it's right here.

1639
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,552
But from now on, you are
my number-one priority.

1640
01:15:09,553 --> 01:15:11,054
I love you so much, Chaz.

1641
01:15:11,055 --> 01:15:13,122
- I love you, Dad.
- Wait a minute!

1642
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:14,423
What about the birds?

1643
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:15,424
- Who?

1644
01:15:15,425 --> 01:15:17,627
- Dr. Larabee,
we need your help.

1645
01:15:17,628 --> 01:15:19,361
- Yeah, hurry up! Let's go!

1646
01:15:19,362 --> 01:15:20,897
- Where was I?

1647
01:15:32,509 --> 01:15:34,644
(Birds shrieking)

1648
01:15:48,959 --> 01:15:51,961
- Targets reached in 10...

1649
01:15:51,962 --> 01:15:54,563
- I think,
if I'm not too late...

1650
01:15:54,564 --> 01:15:55,665
- 9...

1651
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,501
- ...I can redirect the mist...

1652
01:15:58,502 --> 01:16:00,302
- 7, 6...

1653
01:16:00,303 --> 01:16:04,340
- ...and send the birds
out to sea.

1654
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:05,842
- (Robert):
Is it working?

1655
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:08,778
- I sure hope so!
- Come on! Hurry!

1656
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:11,280
- 3...

1657
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:13,349
2...

1658
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:14,483
1...

1659
01:16:14,484 --> 01:16:16,686
(Beeping)

1660
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:19,288
Mission aborted.
Birds returning to base.

1661
01:16:19,289 --> 01:16:20,322
- Evidently.

1662
01:16:20,323 --> 01:16:24,127
(All cheering)

1663
01:16:24,128 --> 01:16:27,096
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1664
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:30,399
- We're lucky.

1665
01:16:32,736 --> 01:16:34,470
- You guys ready to go?

1666
01:16:34,471 --> 01:16:36,372
- Oh yeah!
- Oh yeah!

1667
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:40,943
- Are you excited?
- (Both): Yeah.

1668
01:16:40,944 --> 01:16:43,512
- All right. Belts on, guys.
- Sure.

1669
01:16:43,513 --> 01:16:44,547
(Cell ringing)

1670
01:16:44,548 --> 01:16:46,448
- (Carla):
Not again!

1671
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:48,151
- Do you have to take that?

1672
01:16:48,152 --> 01:16:50,053
- I'll just be a second.

1673
01:16:51,521 --> 01:16:53,455
Hello?

1674
01:16:53,456 --> 01:16:55,457
- Denise? It's Charles.

1675
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,827
- Do you think
this is bad news?

1676
01:16:57,828 --> 01:16:59,929
- I know that look.

1677
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:02,565
She's not coming.

1678
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:03,632
- Just wanted to say,

1679
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:06,002
job well done on
the moisturizing campaign.

1680
01:17:06,003 --> 01:17:09,238
Well, a bit juvenile, yeah,
but the client loves it.

1681
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:12,041
"Smooth as a baby's bottom."
Who would think?

1682
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:15,011
- What are you doing
calling me on a Sunday, Charles?

1683
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:17,980
You have to understand that
weekends are my only days

1684
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,016
to spend quality time
with my family.

1685
01:17:21,318 --> 01:17:22,985
- I respect that.
I get it.

1686
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:25,421
Can we get together
and talk about it?

1687
01:17:25,422 --> 01:17:28,324
- So no more weekend calls.
Are we clear?

1688
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:29,625
- Yeah, I get it.

1689
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:32,528
I'm sorry.

1690
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:35,331
- Look, she is coming!

1691
01:17:35,332 --> 01:17:36,398
(Laughs)

1692
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:37,466
- Let's go!

1693
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:41,904
- Fairfield, the town
that never stops moving!

1694
01:17:41,905 --> 01:17:43,672
Keep it coming!
Keep it coming!

1695
01:17:43,673 --> 01:17:46,508
- Extra! Get your paper today!
Paper! Read it!

1696
01:17:46,509 --> 01:17:48,845
- Hey, let's get a coffee.

1697
01:17:48,846 --> 01:17:51,547
- Hey, Michael!
How you doing, guys?

1698
01:17:51,548 --> 01:17:54,350
Hey, how you doing?
How are you?

1699
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:55,351
Keep it coming!

1700
01:17:55,352 --> 01:17:57,720
Fairfield, the town
that never stops moving!

1701
01:17:57,721 --> 01:18:00,223
- (Sammy): I feel like
we're forgetting something.

1702
01:18:00,224 --> 01:18:02,024
- (Both):
Grandma and Grandpa!

1703
01:18:23,113 --> 01:18:25,815
- Hi! I'm Ariel.
I play Carla.

1704
01:18:25,816 --> 01:18:29,485
This is our set
for Opposite Day.

1705
01:18:29,486 --> 01:18:32,889
- They put this stuff on me
to make me look extra dreamy.

1706
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:36,425
Girls, wives,
girlfriends!

1707
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:37,726
- Wow!

¶ To get to eat
whatever I want... ¶

1710
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:43,632
- Hanging in there.

1711
01:18:43,633 --> 01:18:45,668
It's fun once
you're in the air.

1712
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:48,037
Ahh!

1713
01:18:48,038 --> 01:18:50,273

¶ What happens before... ¶

1715
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:56,245
- Trying to find answers
for the unexplainable?

1716
01:18:56,246 --> 01:18:58,747
Come on down to Cu...
Cal-Worthington!

1717
01:18:58,748 --> 01:19:00,850
- Oh, what a feeling!

(Laughing)

1719
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:04,320
- What are you doing?

1720
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,158

¶ It's no fun to share... ¶

1725
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:30,947

gets Demistified,

01:19:30,948 --> 01:19:32,381
he becomes KGB:

1727
01:19:32,382 --> 01:19:35,017
Kid Gone Bad! Huh?

1728
01:19:35,018 --> 01:19:37,153
- I'm telling you,
I'm innocent!

1729
01:19:37,154 --> 01:19:39,155
- Tell it to the judge.

1730
01:19:39,156 --> 01:19:42,291
- No! No! No!
Let go of me!

1731
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,229
- (Man): Cut! Cut!

1732

(Laughing)

1733
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:50,766
- Is the fleet ready?

1734
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:51,901
- All we have to do

1735
01:19:51,902 --> 01:19:55,404
is finish filling these last
few dispensers with the mist

1736
01:19:55,405 --> 01:19:57,173
and strap them
to the storks.

1737
01:19:57,174 --> 01:19:58,407
The birds! I mean...

1738
01:19:58,408 --> 01:20:01,143
And strap them

1741
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:06,515
- Put yourself
in for a raise.

1742
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:07,649
Oh, I'd have
to do that!

1743
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:09,218
Come on in.
Let's talk about it.

1744
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:11,254
We'll see you
on Monday.

1745
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:14,991
I thought
I was terrific!

1746
01:20:14,992 --> 01:20:16,592
- (Man): Marker.

1747
01:20:16,593 --> 01:20:18,361
- I don't know
the password!

1748
01:20:18,362 --> 01:20:19,929
- You can do it!

1749
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:21,898
(Laughing)

1750
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,234
- D-D-D...

1751
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:26,702
- Run correctly...
- Shh! Shh!

1752
01:20:26,703 --> 01:20:28,371
- But--
- Psh!

1753

- What are you
still doing here?

1754
01:20:30,573 --> 01:20:31,874
Are you still here?

1755
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:34,076
OK. Uh...

1756
01:20:34,077 --> 01:20:36,645
I'm going to ignore you
till you leave.

1757
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:40,316
(Laughing)

1758
01:20:40,317 --> 01:20:42,351
- What are you
laughing at?

1759
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:46,355
What are you
laughing at?

1760
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:48,257
- Sorry! I'm sorry!
