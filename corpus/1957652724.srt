00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:34,066
[bubbling sound]

00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:43,119
[train whistle]

4
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,991
[alarm bell]

5
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:50,561
James, are you up?

6
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,475
I'm up.

7
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,962
[music playing]

8
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,750
Chris, up and at 'em, tiger.

9
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,578
First day of school.

10
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,986
[sniffs]

11
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:26,902
Oh.

12
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,740
[laughs]

13
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,221
James, what are
you doing in there?

14
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,091
Nothing, mom.

15
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,962
Let's get going.

16
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,269
James, slow down.

17
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,924
Here, at least wait until I
study the Heimlich maneuver.

18
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,404
Well, Chris is waiting.

19
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,405
Oh, that's right.

20
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:52,275
Let's see, what has it been?

21
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,189
Two Whole weeks.

22
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,017
Chris, honey, slow down.

23
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,584
So Ray at the
market said, I don't

24
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,238
know how they can afford a
new Lexus when they can't

25
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,543
even settle their grocery bill.

26
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,806
People will not
take responsible.

27
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,982
Careful, little
pictures, big ears.

28
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:14,993
Dude.

29
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,778
Dude.

30
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,996
How was Vegas?

31
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,737
Have I got
something to tell you.

32
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,522
I saw on TV that they
have this giant tower--

33
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,958
Hey, guys.

34
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,307
And a roller coaster
that goes around the top

35
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,700
like 3,000 feet up
and they strap you in.

36
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,615
Hey you dweeb who was there?

37
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,572
You or me?

38
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:29,443
Oh, yeah.

39
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:30,705
Tell me what?

40
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:31,749
That wasn't even
the coolest thing.

41
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,273
Hey, Chris.

42
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,448
The coolest thing was--

43
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,407
Hey, Chris, back from Vegas?

44
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,670
No, I'm still
there, duh, Ernie.

45
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,106
It's cool, huh?

46
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,804
When we went there was
this roller coaster--

47
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,588
Would you guys shut up about
the stupid roller coaster--

48
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,329
- Hey, Chris--
- I did something much cooler.

49
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,243
Hey, guys, wait up.

50
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,811
Great, wait for Walter.

51
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,769
Ah, he's OK.

52
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,510
Anyways, you'll freak.

53
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,207
The coolest thing was--

54
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,819
Hey, Chris, were
you on vacation?

55
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,342
[groans]

56
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:03,303
Toll bridge, pay a
quarter or go the long way.

57
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:06,088
I half a candy bar.

58
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,830
Go inside, small fry.

59
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,702
Mom, said you got
stop calling me that.

60
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,835
OK, medium fry.

61
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,141
First one over
the bridge wins.

62
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,491
Watch out, man.

63
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,319
I'm right behind you.

64
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,412
Go inside, small fries.

65
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:27,370
Tell us more.

66
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:28,763
Details.

67
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:32,157
Wait till we
get everybody, OK.

68
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:32,941
We need to know.

69
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,599
What's up?

70
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:42,298
In Vegas, I did it.

71
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,082
Oh.

72
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:44,953
What?

73
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,607
What did you do?

74
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,130
With the girl?

75
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,219
No, Ernie, what do you think?

76
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,089
OK, sorry.

77
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,395
Go on, go on.

78
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,485
So one night I snuck
down to the Strip.

79
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,704
The Strip.

80
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,140
Wow.

81
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:01,099
A strip club, like
with naked girls.

82
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:08,280
So I turned around,
and I see her.

83
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,413
And?

84
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,372
[school bell rings]

85
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,765
Ah, man.

86
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,116
[music playing]

87
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,991
[whistling]

88
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,038
You look hot, Elise.

89
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,997
But didn't your parents freak.

90
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,651
My dad's even the mayor.

91
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,609
And he's pretty much clueless.

92
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,090
I could have walked
out in my PJs.

93
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,744
Her parents split
up over the summer.

94
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,398
How do you know?

95
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,748
My mom heard it from the
guy at the farmer's market.

96
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,012
He said her mom ran off
with a golf teacher.

97
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,056
Poor Elise.

98
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,015
Mom and Dad would never do that.

99
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,670
My dad said only
lamers get divorced.

100
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,933
Your dad said lamers?

101
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:54,022
He said people should
stay together for life.

102
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,895
Like wolves and pigeons.

103
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,767
And goldfish.

104
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,552
Good morning, grade five.

105
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,945
My name is Mr. Roberts.

106
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,425
But you can call me Kenneth.

107
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,470
You know why?

108
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:10,342
Because that's my name.

109
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,127
Here's a lamer.

110
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,129
You may not know this,
but your teacher last year,

111
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,261
Mrs. Roberts, is my wife.

112
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:19,917
So I know all about you.

113
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,049
So what's your name?

114
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,007
Me, Arthur.

115
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,793
Ah, so you're Arthur.

116
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:29,492
[knocking] Excuse me.

117
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:32,103
This is Tommy Davis.

118
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:32,974
Hi.

119
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:34,279
See that he knows.

120
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,498
Knows what?

121
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,806
About me and Mrs.
Roberts last year.

122
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,330
What about you
and Mrs. Roberts.

123
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,071
[sighs]

124
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,115
No way.

125
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,029
Yes way.

126
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,509
Total love.

127
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,903
You never saw the way she
looked at me at recess?

128
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:51,427
And how she always gave
me the good crayons?

129
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,647
I'm talking the big fat ones.

130
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,518
Yeah.

131
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,432
Wow.

132
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,260
And you and her--

133
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,567
I mean, the two of you--

134
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,873
No, we never got the chance.

135
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,005
It was summer vacation.

136
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,050
She must have told him about us.

137
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,270
Oh, man, you are so busted.

138
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,924
You'll be in the fifth
grade your whole life.

139
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,884
Well, welcome.

140
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,146
You ready to meet
your classmates?

141
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,365
- Sure.
- OK.

142
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,236
People, this is
your new classmate,

143
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,891
just moved here from
Chicago, Tommy Davis.

144
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,023
No, Maddox.

145
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,546
Davis is my stepmom's name.

146
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,113
Oh, your dad's name is Maddox.

147
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,115
No, that's my mom's name.

148
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,333
Oh.

149
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,074
My first dad's
name was McAlester.

150
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:32,860
But when they got divorced,
my mom took her old name back.

151
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,775
Oh, when she married Mr.
Davis, you kept the name.

152
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:35,819
So--

153
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:38,561
No, she married Mr. Stewart.

154
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,345
- Who married Mr. Davis?
- Nobody.

155
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:43,305
That's my stepmom's name before
she married my first dad.

156
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:45,350
My mom married Mr. Stewart.

157
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,614
But he lives in
Brainerd, Minnesota.

158
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:51,269
So I came over here to live with
my stepmom and my first dad.

159
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,490
Last the way we
became the Brady Bunch.

160
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,317
Quiet.

161
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,496
Quiet.

162
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,845
Thank you, Tommy.

163
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,586
Why don't you go find
you seat over there.

164
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,896
This seats taken.

165
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,423
OK.

166
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,946
It's the first day of school.

167
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,382
Let's ease into it by
taking out a piece of paper.

168
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,036
That kid's a operator.

169
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,561
And writing about what you
did over your summer vacation.

170
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,911
[groaning]

171
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,393
Come on, come on,
what did she look like?

172
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:29,438
How old was she?

173
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,701
Did she have big-- you know?

174
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:38,229
- Blonde, 16, really big.
- Whoa

175
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:41,058
What was her name?

176
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:41,972
Ingrid.

177
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,365
Then what?

178
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,845
Then we did it.

179
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:45,802
Did what?

180
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:46,716
Did what?

181
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,891
Come on, details.

182
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,067
Hey, you guys, what did he do?

183
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,374
Ernie, tell your
brother get lost.

184
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,375
That's not fair.

185
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,855
I want to hear.

186
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,639
Nobody ever tells me stuff.

187
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,380
He had sex.
Now get lost.

188
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,381
Come on, Billy.

189
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:00,295
You're too little.

190
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,644
You can't hear this.

191
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,081
I want to know about sex.

192
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,649
I'm telling mom.
- Wait.

193
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,563
OK.

194
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,696
OK.

195
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,827
Sex is--

196
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,655
- Yeah.
- It's--

197
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,484
It's a guy and a girl when
they do something together.

198
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,051
Do something like what?

199
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,444
They share something
beautiful and sweet together.

200
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,229
- Like cake?
- Like cake.

201
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:24,493
Like a jelly doughnut.

202
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,363
OK, we told you.

203
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,539
So go.

204
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,411
Dopey kid.

205
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,935
Cakes.

206
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,634
It's some sort of seed, right?

207
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,679
And it comes out.

208
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,463
Out of your nuts.

209
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:41,510
How does it get
out of your nut?

210
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:44,382
They kind you just crack open.

211
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,688
Yuck.

212
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:49,605
Oh, my gosh, I feel
like I got to puke.

213
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,695
Because that's my name.

214
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,219
You see, that's just
what they did too.

215
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,265
How do you do it?

216
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:59,833
I mean, they talk
to you, really talk.

217
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,226
They look at me like my
spaceship just landed.

218
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,968
You're standing in
front of a blackboard.

219
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,405
I'm out running around
the soccer field,

220
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,669
getting sweaty and
dirty, just like them.

221
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,671
There's a bit of a difference.

222
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,368
You think that's it?

223
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,065
Soccer.

224
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,198
I have never gotten that game.

225
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,026
I mean, no offense, I know
they love it in Europe.

226
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,549
That's not--

227
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,159
By the way, my wife wants
me to ask you something.

228
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,727
She's got this cousin, Debbie.

229
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:25,641
And she's single.

230
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,556
No way.
No way.

231
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,907
No, no, no, no, this one, I
think you'd really like her.

232
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,648
She's a very interesting woman.

233
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,304
She has a collection of snow
globes from all over the world.

234
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,741
I think someone
wants to talk to you.

235
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:42,136
You want to talk to
Mr. Roberts, right?

236
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,007
I'd better excuse myself.

237
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:44,965
See you later, Ken.

238
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:45,879
You think about it.

239
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,271
Yeah, right.

240
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,708
Arthur.

241
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:53,625
I think we need to talk
Mr. Roberts, man to man.

242
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:54,975
OK.

243
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,064
I just want you to
know, nothing happened

244
00:11:57,107 --> 00:12:00,023
between me and your wife.

245
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,634
- Oh, good.
- There wasn't time.

246
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:03,766
Oh, really?

247
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,072
No.

248
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,769
And I didn't want
anybody to get hurt.

249
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,770
You know?

250
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,163
That's very nice of you.

251
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:10,251
No problem.

252
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:11,295
Well, thank you
for telling me.

253
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:15,256
You're OK with this?

254
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,170
Yeah.

255
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,475
Are you?

256
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,912
Yeah.

257
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,784
[music playing]

258
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,057
There's the newbie
with a lot of names.

259
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,798
And 62 parents.

260
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,409
Louise the squeeze
missed the bus.

261
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,803
Go tell her Madonna called
and she wants her boots back.

262
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:41,717
No, you.

263
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,589
I dare you.

264
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,069
OK, I double dare you.

265
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:46,896
OK.

266
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,077
James wants to
tell you something.

267
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,992
Go on, James.

268
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,081
What's the matter.

269
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:58,995
You wuss.

270
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,822
Hey, what's going on?

271
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,087
What did you do.

272
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,436
Nothing.

273
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,698
That's just the effect
he has one women.

274
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,613
Give her some breathing room.

275
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,833
What's the matter, Louise.

276
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,400
Some weeks I go to my
dad's house, and some

277
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,489
weeks I go to my mom's.

278
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,230
Oh that's got to be hard.

279
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:20,016
But when school started, they
were switching, because my mom

280
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,191
gets home earlier.

281
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,411
But my dad didn't
want to do that.

282
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:26,544
And I forgot where I
was supposed to go.

283
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,155
Divorced junk.
Typical.

284
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,199
Look, you stay right here.

285
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,420
And I'll give your folks a call.

286
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:35,205
James, you're in charge.

287
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:39,644
Hey, Louise, is that
a tamaugachi you have?

288
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,471
What's his name?

289
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:45,868
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

290
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,217
- You ready to go?
- Just a sec.

291
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,784
I have something to sort out.

292
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,221
These parents, poor kids
don't know which way is up.

293
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,135
Daddy.

294
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,006

Here's my girl.

296

Have your bag?

297
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:58,011
Yeah.

Sweetie would you
Daddy a forever?

Sure.

300
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,668
Hey, Louise, you
know how to remember

00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,366
which parent to go with?

302
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,671
What's your dad's name?

303

Raymond.

304
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,196
OK, great.

305
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,067
On the days you're going
to your dad's house,

306
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:15,506
wear your tamaugachi on your
right hand, R, Raymond, right,

307
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,551
see?

308
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:19,380
Then you remember all day.

309
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,250
Thanks.

310
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:21,773
What's your name again?

Wow.

It has the most caffeine.

with the girls all day?

And we'll give you a ride.

329

OK?

330
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:58,680
All right, thanks.

Let's go.

00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:00,987
Come on, honey.

333
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,815
Come on, James.

334

should have let her go.

Can I help you?

Hi, James.

Come on in.

up in his room.

00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,893
OK, be careful.
You've got him?

374
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:05,981
I think so.

375
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,287
- OK, no, right there.
- OK,

376
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,505
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,419
Got him.

378
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,726
That's fine.

379
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,337
He's going to
miss his parents.

380
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:16,600
Yeah but if he stayed
in there, they'd eat him.

381
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,775
That's terrible.

382
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,429
That's nature.

383
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,736
CHRIS: Come on, James.

384
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,085
Come on over.

385
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,347
Hi, Chris.

386
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,522
Come on.

387
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:26,567
Hold on, I'll be right there.

388
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,569
MOM: Dinner's in 15.

389
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,659
He's too old
enough to understand.

390
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:32,573
OK, you know what?

391
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,530
This is so unfair.

392
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,228
Let's not do this to him.

393
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,099
- This is crazy.
- Shh

394
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,362
All right, vanilla
pudding, my favorite.

395
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,978
James, your mother and I need
to talk to you about something.

396
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,416
Am I in trouble?

397
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,854
No, no, no, sweetie, we just--
we just want to talk to you.

398
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,378
We didn't want to
mess up your vacation.

399
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,902
But your mother and I've been
discussing a lot of things.

400
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:02,211
And we've decided to
live apart for a while.

401
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,952
Yeah.

402
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:06,607
Now this doesn't change our
relationship with you, James.

403
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,696
We still love you,
very, very much.

404
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,350
It's important to know that.

405
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,264
Mom is still mom.

406
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,526
Dad is still dad.

407
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:13,875
We'll just have our own places.

408
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:18,227
You can come visit
me whenever you want.

409
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,274
Hey, you know, it's
was kind of like TV.

410
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,799
Families don't always get along.

411
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,148
Yeah.

412
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,194
They always get back
together at the end.

413
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,501
[music playing]

414
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:43,774
MOM: If I'm not
here for any reason,

415
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:44,819
leave the keys in the car.

416
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,870
DAD: Tell James I'll call him.

417
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,786
[music playing]

418
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:05,840
[engine starts]

419
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,234
[music playing]

420
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:22,204
[sobbing]

421
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,671
[birds chirping]

422
00:19:57,283 --> 00:20:00,764
Hey, James.

423
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,245
What was up with
your dad last night?

424
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,725
Huh?

425
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,856
I saw him packing the car.

426
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,511
Is he going somewhere?

427
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:09,382
Yeah.

428
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,296
Antarctica.

429
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,123
What?

430
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,257
You know that
ozone hole they have?

431
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,607
Well, NASA's been
trying to fix that.

432
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,740
And they need an
engineer to go up

433
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:22,264
in a special plane and stuff.

434
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,223
Get out of town.

435
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,008
Your dad, wow.

436
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,792
Hey, there's Ernie.

437
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,446
Huh?

438
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,101
Weren't you going to bust
him up for, you know, your mom,

439
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:33,971
knockers.

440
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:34,798
Hey, Ernie.

441
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,762
I told you I
didn't see your mom.

442
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,198
Yeah, well I saw you.

443
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,156
You think a stupid cap
hid your stupid face?

444
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,255
[school bell rings]

445
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:07,918
I wasn't looking at your mom.

446
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:10,356
I bet your dad
will be on news, huh?

447
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,706
I don't think so.

448
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,969
It's kind of a secret.

449
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,536
And you told me?

450
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,667
Thanks, man.

451
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,365
Anyone have the
math assignment.

452
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,018
I fall asleep watching MTV.

453
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,325
And I totally blew it off.

454
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,980
OK, everybody, let's hand
in the math assignment.

455
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,939
Anyone have the
math assignment.

456
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:29,984
Sam, would you collect them?

457
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:30,811
Sure.

458
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,339
Relax.

459
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,209
Just watch.

460
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:45,042
Mr. Roberts, sorry, it's
none of my business,

461
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,784
but you know Louise's
folks split up.

462
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:50,004
I think she had a
tough time at home.

463
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:52,441
And she's worried because
she didn't get her math done.

464
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:55,792
All right, Tommy, thank you.

465
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,446
OK, Thank you.

466
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:05,585
Louise, you can turn in
the assignment tomorrow, OK?

467
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:09,284
Oh, man.

468
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,373
What a scam.

469
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,854
Just cause her parents blew
it, she gets special treatment.

470
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,377
Give me a break.

471
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,121
There you go.

472
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:20,948
Thank you.

473
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:32,220
Uh, oh, you're back.

474
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,396
OK, little guy,
what's your pleasure?

475
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,876
What would you like?

476
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,402
I have donuts, cheesecake,
candy, chewing gun,

477
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,273
chocolate chip cookies.

478
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,187
No.

479
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:44,188
What's the matter?

480
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:47,148
Can't make up your mind?

481
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,236
Would you like me
to do it for you?

482
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:56,984
They call it the government.

483
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:58,986
All they do is give
people money who

484
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,902
don't deserve it and
stick their noses

485
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,252
into people's private affairs.

486
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,428
[car door shuts]

487
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,779
Looks like someone didn't
quite make it to the Antarctic.

488
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,433
And she's no Eskimo.

489
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,696
No Eskimos in the Arctic.

490
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,350
Let me get the camera.

491
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:29,059
Well, she doesn't kiss
like an Eskimo either.

492
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,452
Honey.

493
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,802
Well, just in case
the divorce gets ugly.

494
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,064
Marian, Stay out of this.

495
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,805
She's just as bad as he is.

496
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,678
I knew something was
going on over there.

497
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,810
Chris, James didn't say
a word about this to you?

498
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,159
No.

499
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,901
Well if you can't
tell your best friend,

500
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:47,251
what kind of friend is he?

501
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,000
Morning, guys.

502
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:57,871
Morning, coach.

503
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,227
All right, which one
of you is going to be

504
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,751
most valuable player this year?

505
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:09,622
Right here.

506
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,019
Last year it was James.

507
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,848
The year before Chris.

508
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,677
But you all have
the same chance.

509
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:24,506
Just do your best this year.

510
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,029
Yeah.

511
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:26,987
What?

512
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,945
Yes, coach.

513
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,817
All right, warm up.

514
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,948
Individual drills.

515
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:32,732
Let's go.

516
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:44,091
James, come on.

517
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:58,671
Don't let it go out.

518
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,063
Come on, keep it alive.

519
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,764
Liar.

520
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,243
Huh?

521
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,637
Hey, what happened?

522
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:12,032
Try to get up.

523
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,250
You OK?

524
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,612
Oh, it's a charlie
horse, James.

525
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:30,137
I know it hurts like a son
of a gun, but you'll be OK.

526
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,225
Just sit it out.

527
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,139
OK?

528
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:39,233
Yeah

529
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:42,062
Hey, guys.

530
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:43,629
Come on, play.

531
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:44,586
Good.

532
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,545
Good one.

533
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,590
I can help that.

534
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,592
Here, feel that?

535
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,028
Muscle relaxing?

536
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:52,899
Yeah.

537
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:54,727
Wow.

538
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,511
My second step dad
was a hockey player.

539
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,078
He showed me how to do this.

540
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:00,428
He was always
racking himself up.

541
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,995
How many stepparents
do you have?

542
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,606
Hm, well, let me
put it this way,

543
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,390
we could have a basketball team.

544
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:12,483
When you parents separate,
does it get to you?

545
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:13,528
Sure.

546
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,008
But it's like everything else.

547
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,575
You get used to it.

548
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,403
Last time I was the one
that suggested it to my mom.

549
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:20,317
Really?

550
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,710
The guy was a shrink.

551
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:25,235
You know what they say
about shrinks, right?

552
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,368
Nice guy, but totally bananas.

553
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,195
We were all better off.

554
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,293
So what about you?

555
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,642
Who left, your mom or your dad?

Did Chris say something?

558
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,691
Yeah, like he would
tell me anything.

559
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:46,909
No, I just noticed.

560
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,824
I mean, you're Chris's big body.

561
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:49,956
Now you're not.

562
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,740
You're like zombie man in class.

563

And you're asking
me about this stuff.

564
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,831
Think anybody else knows?

It's getting better.

570
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:19,855
Do you know why your folks
divorced the first time?

571
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,336
At first, I thought
it was because of me.

572
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,206
Really?

573
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,817
You did?

After a while, I realized
my mom like blue eyes.

00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:37,743
My dad had brown eyes.

579
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,919
Sometimes it's as
stupid as that.

580
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,834
My dad's the one
who walked out.

581

And my mom's bummed all time.

00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:15,156
After you pay a quarter each.

739
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,072
MR ROBERTS: A region
of great wonders, some

740
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,510
never seen by the eyes of man.

741
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,208
The woman.

742
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:26,036
MR ROBERTS: To quote space lore,
this is the final frontier.

743
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,998
Next picture, please.

744
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,348
Setting out up the Amazon.

745
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:36,046
Now I admit to being a bit
nervous at this moment.

746
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,006
Not too sure about what
I was going to encounter.

747
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,661
Oh, please, hold your
questions till after.

748
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,577
Next picture, please.

749
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,667
Now here's a
picture with appeal.

750
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,278
Thank you.

751
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,759
Next picture, please.

752
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:57,416
The fiercest creature on the
river, the deadly crocodile.

753
00:35:57,459 --> 00:36:00,897
Actually, interestingly,
they are considered

754
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,465
edible by the natives.

755
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,249
Next picture, please.

756
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,731
KID: That's James's dad.

757
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:16,739
Who did this.

758
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,001
Lights.

759
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:20,830
[laughing]

760
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,576
What was that all about?

761
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,969
Nothing.

762
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:30,057
He's getting a hard
time because his folks

763
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,232
are splitting up.

764
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,538
Oh, I'm sorry, James.

765
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:34,844
It doesn't matter.

766
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,150
Why did you tell him?

767
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,325
Because you can't
keep being ashamed.

768
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:40,241
It's not your fault,
they broke up.

769
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,243
I told you there was
going to be ups and downs.

770
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,984
This won't be the last.

771
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:46,595
I'm just sick of it.

772
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,770
The first year is the worst.

773
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:49,119
It's statistical.

774
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,599
Your folks will pull
you back and forth.

775
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,472
You'll live here and there.

776
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,344
When the kids keep the house and
the parents have to come visit,

777
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:57,737
that will be a
great leap forward.

778
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,956
In the meantime, you
just have to hang on.

779
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,610
And don't blow off
people who want to help.

780
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,394
Yeah.

781
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,834
Your dad having
fun in the Antarctic?

782
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,009
Sure looks like.

783
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:10,924
Was that picture
from your house?

784
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,883
What if it was?

785
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:18,279
Hey, look everyone
there's a fight.

786
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:21,195
[music playing]

787
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:33,033
Come on, get up.

788
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,868
You broke my tooth.

789
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:47,221
Way to go.

790
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,178
One for us.

791
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:49,571
No way, you fought girls.

792
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,312
And we kicked your butt.

793
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,879
Just wait till recess.

794
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,620
Quiet, everyone.

795
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:55,925
He broke my tooth.

796
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,275
Serves you right.

797
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:00,452
Karen, would you
wait outside, please.

798
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:01,801
Let me take a look at it.

799
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:02,671
Don't touch it.

800
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,498
Your hands are dirty.

801
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:08,547
Can I use the
restroom, please.

802
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,374
Yeah, go ahead.

803
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:27,870
[music playing]

804
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,335
Were you following me?

805
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:03,297
No.
I mean, yes.

806
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,430
You were very brave out there.

807
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,345
Are you brave?

808
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:08,128
Yes.

809
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,137
Owe.

810
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,573
No, it's OK.

811
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:25,928
Good boy.

812
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,843
Yes, the dentist
will fix it up so

813
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:28,844
you'd never know what happened.

814
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,240
What is it?

815
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:34,110
Keep still.

816
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:35,285
It's all right.

817
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:42,815
Can I have the rest?

818
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:45,121
Mm.

819
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:45,948
Come here.

820
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,257
Holy moly.

821
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,214
Wow.

822
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,129
Billy rocks.

823
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:55,567
James, James, fighting?

824
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,395
Breaking Chris's tooth,
what were you thinking?

825
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,048
I didn't do it.

826
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,528
Oh, so that means that Chris's
parents and your teachers

827
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:01,660
were lying?

828
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,401
- Yeah, whatever.
- Whatever?

829
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,489
I hate it when you say whatever.

830
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:05,446
Come here.

831
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,360
Let me see your lip.

832
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,840
Oh, look at that.

833
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,276
What kind of a mother does
that make me look like?

834
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,017
And what's your
father going to think?

835
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,410
He picks you up for
your first weekend,

836
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,889
and it looks like you
got hit by a truck.

837
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,370
Why do you care
what he thinks?

838
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,545
It matters.

839
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:18,981
It matters.

840
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:23,290
Listen, James, I have to
be able to rely on you.

841
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,552
OK?

842
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:26,206
Hey, you're the man
of the house now.

843
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:28,164
Well, then who's Dan?

844
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,557
What?

845
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,558
Did you have nice time
at the movies with him?

846
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,867
He's just a
friend from school.

847
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,783
[horn honking] Oh,
there's your dad.

848
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:38,958
We'll talk about this later.

849
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:45,921
Not fair.

850
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,402
Not fair.

851
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,057
You're going to look good.

852
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,276
Oh, my God.

853
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,190
What do you think?

854
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,278
Something, huh?

855
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:56,628
Ready to ride, James?
- What?

856
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,325
Are you out of your
mind on this death trap?

857
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,805
Come on, Bernice.

858
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:00,806
it's perfectly safe.

859
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,330
Don't be such an old fudd.

860
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,332
Listen, if you want to
relive your adolescents,

861
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,551
do it by yourself.

862
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:08,596
My son is not getting
on this machine.

863
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,990
He's my son too.

864
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,992
Well, I would think you'd be
more concerned for his safety

865
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,733
then.
- I am.

866
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,952
That's why I got him my helmet
and he's going to ride with me.

867
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:23,176
This is ridiculous, walking
here with the $10,000 Harley

868
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:26,614
sitting in the driveway.

869
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:27,963
Still, it's pretty rad, huh?

870
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:28,790
Yeah.

871
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,405
Look, James, I
know it's kind of

872
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:36,842
impractical, but heck with it.

873
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:37,843
You only live once.

874
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,804
Size nine and--

875
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:45,677
Size five.

876
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,375
I'm going to get the ball.

877
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,158
Thank you.

878
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:56,296
So, James, how's it going.

879
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,124
Everything good in school?

880
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,561
Did they pick soccer MVP yet?

881
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:01,780
Not yet.

882
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,303
Well, it's either
you or Chris.

883
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,566
Either way, it's good
for you guys, right.

884
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,089
What happened to your lip.

885
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:09,918
Hit by softball.

886
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,137
Hey, James.

887
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,573
Hey, Tommy's here.

888
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,793
Dad, this is Tommy from school.

889
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:15,881
Nice to meet
you, Mr. Calloway.

890
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:17,360
Hey, dude, slap me five.

891
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:20,973
Too slow, take a blow.

892
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,757
All right, you guys,
go get some drinks.

893
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,193
I'll give you some money.

894
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:27,196
I need make a call to
the rental car company.

895
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,023
OK.

896
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:35,901
Your dad's pretty cool.

897
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,598
He's acting dweeby.

898
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,121
He and my mom got
into an argument.

899
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:40,427
It happens.

900
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,560
He's acting all hip
and young, like he's

901
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:45,301
in some Pepsi commercial.

902
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:46,520
TOMMY: It happens.

903
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,044
It's the dad version of stage 2.

904
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:54,136
Ta da.

905
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,399
My clubhouse.

906
00:42:56,443 --> 00:42:57,531
Pretty nice, huh?

907
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,054
Thought you hated TV.

908
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:01,056
Yeah, but this
is like the movies.

909
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,711
You'll think the Terminator
is right in the room with you.

910
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:13,721
And check this out, ta da,
again, everything is exactly

911
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,767
the same at Dad's and Mom's.

912
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,468
You will feel at
home at either place.

913
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,711
Now it's exactly the same.

914
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:57,199
I don't see anything.

915
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:58,679
Where is she?

916
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:00,681
You have to wait.

917
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:01,595
Hey, look.

918
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:06,600
That's not fair.

919
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,907
I'm going.

920
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,256
Hey, champ.

921
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:12,084
You didn't seem to
have a very good time?

922
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:13,476
It's OK.

923
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,131
No, no, we're going
to do better next time.

924
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:18,394
And you'll get to
ride that Harley.

925
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:19,526
I promise.

926
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:20,396
OK.

927
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,223
OK?

928
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:24,487
Bye, Dad.

929
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:25,358
Bye, bye.

930
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:41,243
James, it's Chris
and those guys.

931
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,723
They got Ernie.
- Ah, come on.

932
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,246
Let's go.

933
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,683
Leave him alone.

934
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,162
What's you're problem, Chris?

935
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:48,337
You are.

936
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:49,817
You started this
in the schoolyard.

937
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:51,601
And now we're
going to finish it.

938
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:53,473
We're sick and
tired of you losers

939
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:54,648
getting away with
everything just

940
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,258
because your parents split up.

941
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:58,739
My parents even say
you're bad influences.

942
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,262
Yeah, your parents
say lot of things.

943
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:04,397
Some day they might
even be right.

944
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,877
From now on it's war.

945
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,530
Divorced dweebs stick
with their own kind.

946
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:08,880
And jerk weeds
stick with theirs.

947
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:11,099
Oh, look it's the
kid with 62 parents.

948
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:14,189
That's what you called
him, right James?

949
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:17,149
I'd rather have 62
parents than two jerky ones.

950
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:18,280
What do you know, midget?

951
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,456
You don't even have a dad.

952
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,068
You're a little bastard.

953
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,025
Let me go.

954
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:25,244
I know kung fu.

955
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:26,680
You want war?

956
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,681
You've got it.

957
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,944
And traitors get not mercy.

958
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,380
Get lost, butt brain.

959
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:36,908
What's a bastard?

960
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,910
It's like a spice.

961
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:39,998
Like mustard.

962
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:43,392
Why did he call me a spice.

963
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,133
This is totally weird.

964
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:46,308
I'm going to tell my parents.

965
00:45:46,352 --> 00:45:47,309
Leave your
parents out of this.

966
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:48,223
That's right.

967
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:49,442
Parents are no use.

968
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:50,530
It's just about us.

969
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:03,804
TOMMY: This meeting
is now in session.

970
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:06,633
War, like it or not, we got it.

971
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:08,200
So what do we do?

972
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:11,029
Roll over and take it just
because we're divorced kids?

973
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:12,639
No.

974
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,423
You guys know
what divorced means?

975
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,077
It means we've got to
stand up for ourselves.

976
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:17,731
Yeah.

977
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:23,389
OK, then, we hereby form
the Loyal Order of Divorce.

978
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,133
First order of
business, a war chess.

979
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:38,839
Man, I didn't know
there were so many of us.

980
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:40,101
Wait a minute.

981
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,625
Karen isn't a divorced kid.

982
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,323
Her folks are married.

983
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:45,367
Who cares, Louise?

984
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:47,282
And what about
Ernie and Billy?

985
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:48,588
You guys just have a mom.

986
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,763
That's not the same.

987
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,112
But that's not fair.

988
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:53,071
We can't be with the
married kids either.

989
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:53,941
So?

990
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,247
That doesn't matter.

991
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,553
This has to be just
for divorced kids.

992
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,773
Otherwise what's the point?

993
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,427
She's right.

994
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,255
It's got to be just us.

995
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:06,127
[music playing]

996
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:21,969
You turkeys, our mom has more
boyfriends than any of yours.

997
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:28,149
Sorry, James, war is hell.

998
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:29,716
OK, let me get
this on you here.

999
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,937
There we go.

1000
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,026
My God, Billy, you're
getting a little pot on you.

1001
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,549
What have you been eating?

1002
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:37,942
Nothing.

1003
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:39,552
Nothing my eye.

1004
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:41,597
OK, from now on, you have
got to cut out sweets.

1005
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:43,773
No more chocolate or donuts, OK?

1006
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:46,733
No.

1007
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:50,215
My mom says I'm
getting chubby.

1008
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:51,912
Well, you are kind of.

1009
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:54,828
It's not my fault.
It's all the sex.

1010
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,438
It makes you fat.

1011
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:58,963
Well, my uncle must
have sex all the time.

1012
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:02,183
That's why women get fat
before they have babies.

1013
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:03,402
Babies?

1014
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:05,012
What does that have
to do with sex.

1015
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,580
That's what sex is
for, to have babies.

1016
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:11,149
I don't want to have a baby,
He'll to take all my toys.

1017
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:18,591
[music playing]

1018
00:48:24,118 --> 00:48:25,076
Hi.

1019
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:25,903
Hi.

1020
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,516
Hi.

1021
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,431
Babysitting, sorry.

1022
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:36,217
Just go stay where
I can see you.

1023
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:39,133
Sorry about the club.

1024
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:40,743
It's stupid.

1025
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:43,442
Being divorced doesn't
make me so different.

1026
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:45,966
Well, no, but it makes
you feel different.

1027
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,142
You know, kind of left out.

1028
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:50,884
I mean, now we have
something to belong to.

1029
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,668
And I'm left out.

1030
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:55,106
Sorry.

1031
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:55,933
Here.

1032
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,463
That's not a real diamond.

1033
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,291
Jessica, go.

1034
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,161
It's beautiful.

1035
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:19,304
It's just like Romeo and
Juliet, on opposite sides.

1036
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:22,960
You can't tell your side
you're in love with me.

1037
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,874
Are you in love with me?

1038
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:28,269
Sure, of course.

1039
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:31,707
[music playing]

1040
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:04,871
Ernie, why are
you sitting there?

1041
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:10,007
To-- uh-- see better.

1042
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,617
Why is everyone moved around?

1043
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,531
OK, that's it.

1044
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,620
No more moving seats.

1045
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:17,927
Now, Louise, please come up here
and complete these problems.

1046
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,233
[cheers] Quiet.

1047
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:20,495
What is that for?

1048
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:22,193
This is not a spectator sport.

1049
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,890
Think this is humorous, Walter?

1050
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:25,892
Why don't you come up here
and complete these problems?

1051
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,938
[cheering] What is that?

1052
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:32,116
What is going on?

1053
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,510
Well, this is it.

1054
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:38,165
Last practice before I
name most valuable player.

1055
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:39,079
Come on.

1056
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:39,906
Let's go.

1057
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,347
Come on.

1058
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:47,827
Come on, guys.

1059
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,264
Energy, energy.

1060
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:53,659
[music playing]

1061
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,941
[whistle blows]

1062
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,203
What are you doing?

1063
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,030
Guys?

1064
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:28,824
What is this?

1065
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:31,436
Soccer or mud wrestling?

1066
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:32,393
Soccer.

1067
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:33,307
It doesn't look like it.

1068
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:37,703
OK, that's it.

1069
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:39,835
Practice is over.

1070
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,359
James, Chris, over here.

1071
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:48,322
Good work, Ernie.

1072
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:49,497
Can't believe it.

1073
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:56,156
What's going on, guys?

1074
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,159
You are the key
players on the team.

1075
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,335
The others look up to you.

1076
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:03,990
And now you won't even
pass to each other.

1077
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,948
What is this all about?

1078
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:07,559
You two fighting?

1079
00:52:07,602 --> 00:52:09,474
Huh?

1080
00:52:09,517 --> 00:52:13,739
Team means we stick up for
each other no matter what.

1081
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:16,916
I want both of you
to think about that.

1082
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:20,528
And while you think about
it, give me 10 laps.

1083
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:21,834
Come on.

1084
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:23,227
Come on.

1085
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,098
Excuse me, coach.

1086
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,492
I guess my mind isn't
really on the game

1087
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:28,754
because my parents
are getting divorced.

1088
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,848
I'm sorry about that James.

1089
00:52:35,891 --> 00:52:38,329
I know that must be hard.

1090
00:52:38,372 --> 00:52:42,028
But do you think that
that's a good reason for you

1091
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:44,030
to let your teammates down?

1092
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:46,119
To let yourself down?

1093
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,816
No, not really.

1094
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:53,082
Then go out there and give me
those laps with your teammate.

1095
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:55,041
You're hooked up with Karen.

1096
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:56,564
None of your beeswax.

1097
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,000
Love her forever?

1098
00:52:58,044 --> 00:52:58,914
Going to get married?

1099
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,220
So what if we do.

1100
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:01,308
Here's what.

1101
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:02,962
You're going to mess her up.

1102
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:05,138
Shut up.

1103
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,879
It's true.

1104
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:10,187
Kids whose parents get divorced
always get divorced themselves.

1105
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,275
That's baloney.

1106
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:12,624
It's a fact.

1107
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,234
You're going to make
Karen feel just how

1108
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,453
your dad made your mom feel.

1109
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:17,063
I am not.

1110
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,152
Sorry, it's statistical.

1111
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:26,246
CHRIS: Look, I have no
other friends a lot.

1112
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:30,032
And, well, I don't want anyone
to get hurt, including you,

1113
00:53:30,076 --> 00:53:33,993
So I think that we
should break up.

1114
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:34,994
But why?

1115
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:35,951
We're fine.

1116
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:37,431
I mean--

1117
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:40,304
[music playing]

1118
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:15,904
Is it true?

1119
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:18,080
Kids whose parents
get divorced wind

1120
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:20,039
up getting divorced themselves?

1121
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:22,650
Well, yeah, that's
what the statistics say.

1122
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:23,695
Man

1123
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:26,959
You can't let it bother you.

1124
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:29,744
[music playing]

1125
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:39,624
It's a mess.

1126
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,060
Oh, man.

1127
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:42,322
Those creeps.

1128
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,236
Look what they did.

1129
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,368
It's not fair.

1130
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:45,717
There's just too many of them.

1131
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,196
We didn't do it.

1132
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,067
Who's there?

1133
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,070
Come out.

1134
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:52,332
It's just us.

1135
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,073
What do you want?

1136
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:55,379
We want to join you guys.

1137
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,945
We have more fun with
you all than Chris

1138
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,425
and wait-for-me Walter.

1139
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,818
But your folks
aren't divorced?

1140
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:01,080
Who cares?

1141
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:01,994
We're getting our
butt kicked here.

1142
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:03,038
We could use the help.

1143
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:03,909
No way.

1144
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:05,302
This is our club.

1145
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:06,390
Louise is right.

1146
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,174
We win or lose this ourselves.

1147
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:09,262
No one else.

1148
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,611
But we want in.

1149
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,744
Whatever we have to do
to join we'll do it.

1150
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:13,919
What?

1151
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:15,529
You'll get your
parents divorced?

1152
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:16,400
Sure.

1153
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:17,357
I was just kidding.

1154
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,271
No.

1155
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,012
Wait.

1156
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,231
If that's what they want, maybe
it's better for some of them.

1157
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,102
Wait a minute.

1158
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:24,016
That's really mean.

1159
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,496
It doesn't have to be.

1160
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:28,281
Like Sam, his folks
are always fighting.

1161
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,413
He hates it.

1162
00:55:29,456 --> 00:55:30,370
Maybe they'd be
happier divorced.

1163
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:33,591
[ahem] Oh, sorry Sam.

1164
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:35,375
No, it's true.

1165
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:37,856
Well, if it were better.

1166
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,510
And he's not the only one.

1167
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:42,295
There's lots of people who
would be better off split up.

1168
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,644
Let's do it.

1169
00:55:43,688 --> 00:55:48,388
Prepare to launch
Operation Splitsville.

1170
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:49,868
[cheers]

1171
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:53,828
One, two, three, Splitsville.

1172
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:55,308
Is that him?

1173
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,310
Yeah, that's Sam's dad.

1174
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,094
Sam says he comes
here every two weeks.

1175
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:00,400
OK, do you know your line?

1176
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,837
OK, how do you know that?

1177
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:04,273
How do you know that?

1178
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:07,233
No, no, how do you know that?

1179
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:09,104
OK, OK, it's not the
Gettysburg Address.

1180
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:11,933
Come on.

1181
00:56:11,977 --> 00:56:15,589
So anyway, they say his
dad spends all his time

1182
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:17,896
buying new clothes
and getting haircuts

1183
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,593
instead of looking for work.

1184
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:21,987
How do you know that?

1185
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:24,555
Sam's mom told everyone
at the beauty salon.

1186
00:56:24,598 --> 00:56:27,296
My mom was there.

1187
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,559
Hey, we're not done.

1188
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:30,169
I've got to talk to my wife.

1189
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:38,743
Is that Leo's dad?

1190
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:40,527
Yeah, here he comes.

1191
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:46,359
We're meeting the
Peterson's at 6:00.

1192
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:52,409
Oh, sorry.

1193
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:08,425
Excuse me, ma'am.

1194
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,296
Your husband missed this one.

1195
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:11,123
Thank you.

1196
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:19,740
I'll make sure he gets
it when he gets home.

1197
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:22,395
All right, family,
start up your taste buds.

1198
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,267
Dad's super shishkebabs
are on the way.

1199
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:26,530
Well, it better
not be too spicy.

1200
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:27,444
You know my stomach.

1201
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:28,488
Yes, I do, Marlene.

1202
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:29,707
You tell me that all the time.

1203
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,230
Well, I mean it all the time.

1204
00:57:31,273 --> 00:57:32,927
Um-- uh-- Dad?

1205
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:35,495
Yeah, what is it, honey?

1206
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,323
Um-- I-- you know--

1207
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:39,673
I-- uh-- I Forget

1208
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,370
You forget?

1209
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:42,502
What did you forget?

1210
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:43,938
What was it, sweetheart?
- Nothing.

1211
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,331
- Did you see something?
- No.

1212
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,420
Oh, honey, you still
got something wait.

1213
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,640
He's forgetting a lot.

All right, all right.

1218
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:09,529

with you, moron.

Hey, sweet cakes,

1221
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:15,535
had a fun time the other night?

1222
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:19,539
Looking forward to seeing You

1223
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:22,629
Kissy, kissy, see you soon.

1225
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:25,066
Here you.

1226
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,025
Thank you, very much, sir.

1227
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:28,548
Here's yours.

[music playing]

1229
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:46,174
Who was that?

1230
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:47,872
You're sister is cute.

1231
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:51,832
Half-sister. and all business.

1232
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:54,835
Come on, get out.

1233
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:56,837
How could you
go kissing someone

1234
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,143
in the middle of the afternoon?

1235
00:58:58,186 --> 00:58:59,405
I told you I didn't
know who she was.

1236
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:00,537
Of course you
know who she was.

1237
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,581
She came out of nowhere.

1238
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,756
I'm supposed to believe that?

1239
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,149
I don't believe
that for a minute.

1240
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:05,542
Suckers, we got them good.

1241
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,465
OK, status report on
Operation Splitsville.

1242
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:18,250
Sam says his folks
aren't speaking.

1243
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:22,602
[cheers] And Leo's mom made
his dad sleep on the couch.

1244
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,822
All right.

1245
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,607
Arthur says his mom and dad
won't eat each other's cooking.

1246
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:31,176
They bought a pizza
five times this week.

1247
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:32,351
Three new members on the way.

1248
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:35,833
Operation Splitsville.

1249
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,661
MR ROBERTS: What's
going on here?

1250
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:47,714
Your my inside woman.

1251
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:50,587
I need some inside information.

1252
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,894
I may be a teacher, but
I'm not entirely clueless.

1253
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:56,593
Half the fifth grade won't
talk to the other half.

1254
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:57,985
And none of them
will talk to me.

1255
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:06,080
What's going on out there?

1256
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:08,996
I don't know.

1257
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,781
I'm in fourth grade.

1258
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,913
MRS ROBERTS: Kenneth,
just leave her alone.

1259
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:14,785
It's OK for you, you
don't have the Cold

1260
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:16,351
War raging in your classroom.

1261
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,223
Well, Karen can't help you.

1262
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:21,792
You're just going to have to
take care of your own class.

1263
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:23,837
What does that mean?

1264
01:00:23,881 --> 01:00:25,709
What are you trying to say?

1265
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:28,537
Oh, honestly.

1266
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,061
You never cease to amaze me.

1267
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:35,022
Mom?

1268
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:36,937
What does smug mean?

1269
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:40,593
Smug, um-- self-satisfied,
thinking that you're better

1270
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,160
than everyone else.

1271
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:44,597
Kind of like gloating.

1272
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,730
Why?

1273
01:00:46,773 --> 01:00:50,821
Oh, nothing, just
something I heard Dad say.

1274
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:51,778
Really.

1275
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:52,692
Mm, hm.

1276
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:02,223
MRS ROBERTS: I'm smug am I?

1277
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,703
MR ROBERTS: What?

1278
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:06,097
[music playing]

1279
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,145
Hi.

1280
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:13,670
Hi.

1281
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:16,455
I have a nice time,
but I'm getting fat

1282
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:19,240
and I don't want a baby.

1283
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:22,635
I'm sorry, a baby?

1284
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,984
I'm too young.

1285
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:27,988
So this is-- goodbye.

1286
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:30,730
I'll never forget you
even when I'm eight.

1287
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,477
[school bell rings]

1288
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:44,483
James you've always
been an excellent student.

1289
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:47,138
But this year your grades
have slipped badly.

1290
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:49,923
Well, Mr. Roberts, there's
been a lot of trouble at home,

1291
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,490
divorcing.

1292
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,622
Yeah, I understand, but
your grades are your grades.

1293
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,755
And you are in real danger
of not passing this year.

1294
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,105
Kenneth, I'm ready to
go home whenever you are.

1295
01:01:58,149 --> 01:01:58,976
Fine.

1296
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,673
Just a sec.

1297
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,197
Bottom line, everything I
said about that test next week

1298
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:05,069
goes double for you.

1299
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:05,983
OK?

1300
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:08,637
OK.

1301
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:09,943
I'm just saying I'm ready.

1302
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:12,337
I don't want to sound smug.

1303
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,034
Not that again with the smug.

1304
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:15,732
I still don't know what
you're talking about.

1305
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:16,994
Really?
You don't?

1306
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:19,170
No, tell me.

1307
01:02:23,174 --> 01:02:24,741
What are you talking about?

1308
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:26,786
Nothing, forget it.

1309
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:27,700
Hi.

1310
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,745
Hi.

1311
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,572
What's up with your parents?

1312
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:31,617
Are they arguing?

1313
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,705
Yeah, a lot.

1314
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,099
Bye, James, excuse me.

1315
01:02:35,142 --> 01:02:38,450
I'll be in the club soon, you
know, Operations Splitsville.

1316
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:39,712
MRS ROBERTS: Look
where you're parked.

1317
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,105
MR ROBERTS: I didn't realize.

1318
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:43,411
And we can get back together.

1319
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,152
What is she doing.

1320
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,938
MR ROBERTS: Do you have to have
everything in the front seat?

1321
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:51,463
MRS ROBERTS: Oh,
give me a break.

1322
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:55,206
[whistle blows]

1323
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:56,947
Give me your glasses.

1324
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:03,127
Here it is, the day you've
all been waiting for,

1325
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:07,827
the big announcement,
the final verdict.

1326
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:12,136
I've been watching you
all very carefully.

1327
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:14,616
And I've made my decision.

1328
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:18,142
This year's most
valuable player is--

1329
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:19,796
It will be Chris.

1330
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,101
No, no, it'll James.

1331
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:24,844
Ernie.

1332
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:25,758
What?

1333
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,064
He sucks.

1334
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:28,848
But he's the worst
player on the team.

1335
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,067
Wrong.

1336
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,765
He's the only
player on the team.

1337
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,114
I don't know what
the rest of you

1338
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:37,335
are doing, not passing,
tripping, fighting.

1339
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:40,860
But Ernie is the only one
among you still playing soccer.

1340
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:44,864
And that makes him the MVP.

1341
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,344
Yeah.

1342
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:47,824
Yeah.

1343
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:48,694
All right.

1344
01:03:51,784 --> 01:03:52,785
Coach, can I talk to you.

1345
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,656
It's no use pleading, James.

1346
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,788
I made my choice.

1347
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,702
I know.

1348
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:57,921
I have another question.

1349
01:03:57,964 --> 01:03:59,836
OK, shoot.

1350
01:03:59,879 --> 01:04:02,577
There's a lot of
statistics in sports, huh?

1351
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:04,492
You mean like
kicking distances,

1352
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:06,103
RBI, stuff like that?

1353
01:04:06,146 --> 01:04:07,582
Yeah, all that stuff.

1354
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:09,323
It must work, right?

1355
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:12,674
I mean, otherwise who would
bother figure them out.

1356
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:14,024
You're losing me, James.

1357
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:15,373
What are you asking?

1358
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,636
Just that if
statistics say something,

1359
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,464
you should believe it, right?

1360
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:21,161
No.

1361
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:22,075
No?

1362
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,337
No.

1363
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:25,774
Statistically you
should be Chinese.

1364
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:27,341
Huh?

1365
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:31,171
Look, over 60% of the
people in the world are Asian.

1366
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:34,609
Therefore, statistically
most people are Asian.

1367
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:38,265
You are a person, so--

1368
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:40,354
they're just numbers, James.

1369
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:42,661
When you get ready
to take a penalty,

1370
01:04:42,704 --> 01:04:45,620
no number tells what you
are thinking or feeling.

1371
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:48,841
Statistics only know
what happened last time.

1372
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,974
This time, that's up to you.

1373
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,149
Thanks, coach.

1374
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,672
Don't thank me.

1375
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:54,978
Start playing with
your team again.

1376
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:05,336
TOMMY: We are here to mark
this momentous occasion.

1377
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:09,427
Samuel Banks, do you wish to
join in this noble assembly?

1378
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,645
Uh, huh.

1379
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,038
I mean, yes.

1380
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:14,954
And are you qualified
to serve in our ranks?

1381
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:17,087
Yes my dad moved
out last night.

1382
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:20,873
Then I dub thee a fully
qualified member of the Loyal

1383
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,398
Order of Divorce, ready
to join us in our fight

1384
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:26,270
against the non-divorced.

1385
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:29,664
[music playing]

1386
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:06,614
[water bubbling]

1387
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:32,031
Owe.

1388
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,641
Sorry.

1389
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:36,253
Why didn't you just
ring the doorbell?

1390
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:37,732
Uh-- I don't know.

1391
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:46,132
Look I'm sorry.

1392
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:48,569
I didn't really
mean to break up.

1393
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:50,658
Then how come you did?

1394
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:52,878
Well, I guess because I
listened to something really

1395
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:54,749
dumb someone told me.

1396
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:56,969
This whole war thing is dumb.

1397
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,144
Well, I liked the
club when it was

1398
01:06:58,188 --> 01:07:00,886
just us talking about stuff.

1399
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:02,279
I mean, now it's kind of weird.

1400
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,979
So you don't mean to join?

1401
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,589
I don't want you to
make your parents breakup.

1402
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:09,503
It's not fun.

1403
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:10,722
I know.

1404
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,376
[sneezing]

1405
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:16,206
Oh, no.

1406
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:18,077
Hey, are we having
a meeting tonight?

1407
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,645
No, everyone is getting
ready for the test.

1408
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,429
Tommy says we should
put the war on hold

1409
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:23,952
till after the test.

1410
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:24,866
Then we'll knock them out.

1411
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:35,051
Hey, Sam.

1412
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:37,531
We'll have a meeting
next week or something.

1413
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:39,098
It's OK.

1414
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,621
I don't care about
that war stuff so much.

1415
01:07:40,665 --> 01:07:42,754
I just wanted to hang
out or something.

1416
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:43,711
You OK.

1417
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:44,582
Yeah, just--

1418
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,105
What?

1419
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,151
Like Sunday, the car
races were on, Formula One.

1420
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:49,717
Yeah.

1421
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:51,589
And me and my dad used
to watch them all the time.

1422
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:54,113
He let me used to
watch to time the laps.

1423
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:56,159
But didn't your dad
always argue with your mom

1424
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:57,377
all that time?

1425
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,597
Yes, now she fights
with us instead.

1426
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:03,992
I kind of miss him.

1427
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:05,864
I got to go.

1428
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,659
Excuse me.

1429
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:22,663
Karen, listen, you can't
let your parents split up.

1430
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:23,708
We got to do something.

1431
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:25,536
Well, what are we going to do?

1432
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:27,886
I'll think of something.

1433
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:30,845
KAREN: No, you goof, my mom
wouldn't call him Mr. Roberts.

1434
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:33,631
JAMES: Oh, yeah, so what
do they call each other

1435
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:37,461
when they're, you know, mushy?

1436
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:38,723
I don't know, pookey.

1437
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:50,474
Pookey, I don't want to fight.

1438
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:54,304
Meet me at Case Luna at 6:00.

1439
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:56,262
Oh, good.

1440
01:08:56,306 --> 01:08:58,134
I know Mrs. Roberts
is in the meeting,

1441
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:01,180
but can I leave a
message from her husband?

1442
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:03,269
Meet him at Case Luna at 6:00.

1443
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:04,314
Thank you.

1444
01:09:04,357 --> 01:09:06,446
Oh, and don't worry about Karen.

1445
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,708
She has a sitter.

1446
01:09:07,752 --> 01:09:08,622
Bye.

1447
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:09,928
Thank you.

1448
01:09:09,971 --> 01:09:11,843
A sitter.

1449
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:14,715
[music playing]

1450
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,420
[singing in spanish]

1451
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,001
Two, please.

1452
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,057
MR ROBERTS: Hi, honey.

1453
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:52,971
Hi.

1454
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:54,364
Oh, they kissed.

1455
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:55,234
Oh, romantic.

1456
01:09:58,281 --> 01:09:59,456
God, this place.

1457
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:00,892
A lot of memories for us.

1458
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,285
Oh, yeah, there are.

1459
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,461
I'm just glad you came
to your senses, Estelle.

1460
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:05,375
That's cute.

1461
01:10:05,418 --> 01:10:08,116
My senses.

1462
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,901
Well, you invited me here.

1463
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:11,119
And--

1464
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:12,382
What are you talking about?

1465
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:14,688
You sent me a little note.

1466
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:16,124
What note?

1467
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:18,257
Kenneth, if this is
some kind of joke,

1468
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,954
I don't think it's very funny.

1469
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:21,782
You called me Pookey.

1470
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:23,436
Pookey.

1471
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,916
Believe me, there's a lot of
things I'd like to call you.

1472
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:28,572
And Pookey is not one of them.

1473
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:30,313
Forget it, let's just go home.

1474
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:31,923
Oh, mayday, mayday.

1475
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:34,708
I didn't like
this place anyway.

1476
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:36,057
Look, it's coach.

1477
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:40,497
Hi, cousin.

1478
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,715
What a coincidence.

1479
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:43,021
Isn't this funny?

1480
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:44,022
Yeah.

1481
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,241
Would you like to join us?

1482
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:46,111
No.

1483
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:47,025
No.

1484
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:48,635
We were just going.

1485
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,115
We're absolutely stuffed.

1486
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:50,942
Have you ordered yet?

1487
01:10:54,772 --> 01:10:55,903
See you later.

1488
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:01,169
[school bell ringing]

1489
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:02,910
This is it, test day.

1490
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:03,868
Clear your desks.

1491
01:11:14,313 --> 01:11:15,401
Where's Sam?

1492
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:16,359
Does anyone know?

1493
01:11:16,402 --> 01:11:18,622
Is he sick today?

1494
01:11:18,665 --> 01:11:21,494
[music playing]

1495
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:35,203
Oh, little bird.

1496
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:40,992
You folks leave you?

1497
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,341
Well, you don't need them.

1498
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:50,044
OK, begin.

1499
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:59,315
[knocking] I'll be right back.

1500
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:02,187
Mr. Roberts,
these are the Banks.

1501
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,493
That's Sam's mom and dad.

1502
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:09,934
You're right.

1503
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,370
Let me ask the kids.

1504
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:12,545
Just a minute.

1505
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,199
All right, stop working.

1506
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:16,027
This is very important.

1507
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:19,160
Sam has not been
home since yesterday.

1508
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:22,250
If any of you know where
he is you have to tell me.

1509
01:12:22,294 --> 01:12:24,383
I promise he won't be punished.

1510
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,864
You understand this
is very serious.

1511
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:28,431
We're all concerned
for Sam's safety.

1512
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:35,525
This is our fault.
We got him into this

1513
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:37,178
because of the stupid war.

1514
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:39,398
Sam did what he
wanted to do, James.

1515
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:41,400
We didn't do anything.

1516
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:43,054
I knew something was
wrong with him yesterday.

1517
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:44,142
I've got to find him.

1518
01:12:44,185 --> 01:12:45,012
What?

1519
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:47,145
Are you crazy?

1520
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:50,017
James, wait.

1521
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,280
OK, everybody everything's OK.

1522
01:12:52,324 --> 01:12:55,240
Mr. Roberts, he's going
to help look for Sam.

1523
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:57,416
And I'm going to help him by
watching you take your test.

1524
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,635
So all eyes on your papers.

1525
01:12:58,678 --> 01:12:59,549
Let's go.

1526
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,942
Do your best.

1527
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:05,337
[music playing]

1528
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:27,228
Look at the ball.

1529
01:13:27,272 --> 01:13:29,274
Anticipate my move.

1530
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:31,015
Yes, very good.

1531
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:31,885
There's a problem.

1532
01:13:31,929 --> 01:13:32,799
What now?

1533
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:33,974
Sam Banks is missing.

1534
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:35,585
OK, that's it.
Go on in.

1535
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:36,977
- His folks say--
- Good work.

1536
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:38,370
He didn't come
home last night.

1537
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,676
Did they call police?

1538
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:40,981
Oh, yeah they've
been out all morning.

1539
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:41,895
I should've known
there was a problem.

1540
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:42,940
You would have.

1541
01:13:42,983 --> 01:13:44,420
You give me too much credit.

1542
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:45,856
I'm a soccer coach.

1543
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:47,814
I can't read their minds.

1544
01:13:47,858 --> 01:13:49,642
Help me out here.

1545
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:51,601
Sam's parents just split up.

1546
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:53,559
I think he took it pretty hard.

1547
01:13:53,603 --> 01:13:56,910
Now, you're a kid, you're
angry at the world.

1548
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:57,911
What would you do?

1549
01:13:57,955 --> 01:13:59,304
What about that clubhouse?

1550
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:00,479
Huh?

1551
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:02,525
They didn't check
the clubhouse?

1552
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:03,917
What clubhouse?

1553
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:05,223
Let's go.

1554
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:08,095
[music playing]

1555
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:22,806
JAMES: Sam?

1556
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:24,329
Sam, are you here?

1557
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:32,642
Where'd you go?

1558
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,361
[music playing]

1559
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,224
Please hurry.
What if he's hurt?

1560
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:34,094
Don't worry.

1561
01:15:34,138 --> 01:15:35,095
Sam's a good kid.

1562
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:37,924
He won't do anything stupid.

1563
01:15:37,968 --> 01:15:40,797
[music playing]

1564
01:16:02,296 --> 01:16:03,341
Sam.

1565
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,124
Sam.

1566
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:09,477
Where's the famous clubhouse?

1567
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:11,871
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

1568
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:12,872
Sam.

1569
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:13,786
Sam.

1570
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,874
Sam.

[music playing]

1572
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:43,947
Hey, how did you get up here?

1573
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:45,644
Hi, James.

1574
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:48,081
Wouldn't it be
cool to fly, James?

1575
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:50,083
I dreamt about it.

1576
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:52,216
My mom and dad were down
there yelling at me.

1577
01:16:52,259 --> 01:16:53,913
And then they got smaller
and smaller till they

1578
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:55,306
weren't there any more.

1579
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,873
Yeah, that's cool all right.

1580
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:58,614
But that's just in dreams.

1581
01:16:58,657 --> 01:16:59,484
I know.

1582
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:21,549
You see that?

1583
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:22,681
Yeah.

1584
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:24,422
Come on.

01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,483
I left my jacket
in the clubhouse.

Let's go get it.

1588
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:47,488
Over here.

01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:05,376
Sam.

1592
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:11,425
I'm glad you're back.

1593
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:13,819
I don't want to let you go.

[yelling]

1599
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:18,492
I got him.

1600
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:19,885
I got him.

1601
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:30,417
Give him a pencil.

1602
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:32,332
Get him a test.

1603
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:38,382
All right, everybody,
emergency is over.

1604
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:40,123
The fish is fine.

1605
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,646
See.

1606
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:42,473
Get back to work.

1607
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:48,305
Did somebody move?

1608
01:19:48,348 --> 01:19:50,481
No, ma'am.

1609
01:19:50,524 --> 01:19:51,308
OK.

1610
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:04,277
Kids, you'll be happy to
know that Sam has been found.

1611
01:20:04,321 --> 01:20:05,539
And he's back with
his mom and dad.

1612
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:06,323
He's fine.

1613
01:20:08,673 --> 01:20:10,196
Don't be so modest, Ken.

1614
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,372
Your class should know.

1615
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:15,158
Mr. Roberts is the
one who found Sam.

1616
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:24,602
All right, now let's
get back to work.

1617
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,348
OK, time's up.

1618
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,045
Pass your tests forward.

1619
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:38,834
I'm dead.

1620
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:40,313
You didn't get
to do any of it?

1621
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:41,880
I didn't even hand it in.

1622
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:43,055
I don't think he'll
give us points

1623
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:43,926
for writing out name on it.

1624
01:20:46,754 --> 01:20:47,538
That that's.

1625
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:51,498
Well, maybe not.

1626
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,500
I'll see later.

Tony, here he comes.

01:21:01,944 --> 01:21:03,597
Throw it.

1631
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:06,687
Oop, almost.

1632
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:10,169

[music playing]

1634
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:14,478
Got it.

1635
01:21:17,524 --> 01:21:19,439
You OK, Mr. Roberts?

1636
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:20,397
Oh, yeah.

1637
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,441
Oh, yeah.

1638
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:23,922
We got all the test for you.

1639
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:25,924
Thank you.

1640
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:28,448
All right, let's try that again.

1641
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:29,362
Here's your pen.

1642
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:30,189
See you tomorrow.

1643
01:21:32,757 --> 01:21:33,540
Yes.

1644
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:43,507
[knocking]

1645
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:44,508
Hi.

1646
01:21:44,551 --> 01:21:45,335
Hi.

1647
01:21:50,514 --> 01:21:52,733
Well, I have
something to tell you.

1648
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:55,301
I'm going to have to go
away for a little while.

1649
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:56,607
I know.

1650
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:57,695
You do.

1651
01:21:57,738 --> 01:21:59,392
I saw you get your showcase.

1652
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:01,090
Yeah, well, I
have to go to Denver

1653
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:02,700
for this teaching
conference, and I think

1654
01:22:02,743 --> 01:22:03,962
I'm going to be gone from--
- What?

1655
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:04,963
Thursday to--

1656
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:06,573
But I thought you were--

1657
01:22:06,617 --> 01:22:07,879
What?

1658
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,881
I thought you were
getting divorced.

1659
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,622
Divorced?

1660
01:22:11,665 --> 01:22:15,365
Well, you and dad
were arguing so much.

1661
01:22:15,408 --> 01:22:17,584
Oh, honey, well,
sure we argue.

1662
01:22:17,628 --> 01:22:19,456
I mean people do sometimes.

1663
01:22:19,499 --> 01:22:23,112
But your dad and I love
each other an awful lot.

1664
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:24,678
I'm sorry you thought that.

1665
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:34,384
KAREN: Guess what?

1666
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:35,733
My parents aren't
getting divorced.

1667
01:22:35,776 --> 01:22:37,778
My mom just had a
conference in Denver.

1668
01:22:37,822 --> 01:22:38,954
They're not?

1669
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,390
No, so they were just arguing.

1670
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:41,521
So we were totally clueless.

1671
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:42,435
That's great.

1672
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:43,741
What's great?

1673
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:45,308
Karen's aren't
getting a divorce.

1674
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:46,570
That's their choice.

1675
01:22:46,613 --> 01:22:47,701
And that's not all.

1676
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,225
You know that test?

1677
01:22:49,268 --> 01:22:51,662
I got one from my dad
and I filled it all out

1678
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:53,229
and put it in the file for you.

1679
01:22:53,272 --> 01:22:54,360
You what?
Oh, no.

1680
01:22:54,404 --> 01:22:55,274
What?

1681
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:56,667
I did the same thing.

1682
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:58,625
Now there are two test
with your name on it.

1683
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,236
Great.

1684
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:02,412
So now just not only flunk,
I get busted for cheating.

1685
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:04,022
OK, let's not panic here.

1686
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:05,763
All we have to do is--

1687
01:23:05,806 --> 01:23:09,593
uh-- sneak into the classroom
and take away the extra tests.

1688
01:23:09,636 --> 01:23:11,029
Yeah, right.

1689
01:23:11,073 --> 01:23:12,683
Yeah, my dad's not
finished grading them yet.

1690
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,293
OK, we've only got
a couple of minutes.

1691
01:23:14,337 --> 01:23:15,207
So let's--

1692
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:16,817
No, no.

1693
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:18,210
Don't help me any more.

1694
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:19,777
Thank you very much.

1695
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:21,605
I'll do this one myself.

1696
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:25,000
[music playing]

1697
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:44,715
James, can I help
you find something?

1698
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:03,516
James, Mr. Roberts would
like to speak with you.

1699
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,388
Come on in, James.

1700
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:18,444
You know our attitude
towards cheating.

1701
01:24:18,488 --> 01:24:20,620
It cuts against everything
we try to do here.

1702
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:25,190
It's one of the most serious
offenses a student can commit.

1703
01:24:25,234 --> 01:24:28,106
Now this is what's
going to happen.

1704
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:31,066
The two false tests
will be thrown out.

1705
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:34,112
And I'll be having a little
talk with Tommy and my daughter.

1706
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:36,984
See teachers, even
the slower ones,

1707
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:39,596
get to recognize their
students handwriting.

1708
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:41,119
It wasn't really their fault.

1709
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:42,207
And now to you.

1710
01:24:45,297 --> 01:24:49,519
You will stay after school
today and take a makeup test.

1711
01:24:49,562 --> 01:24:52,087
And you can count on the
questions being different.

1712
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,914
That's-- that's all?

1713
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:55,916
Would you prefer
electrocution?

1714
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,483
Well, no, sir.

1715
01:24:57,527 --> 01:24:59,746
But why?

1716
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:01,400
Well, because one
of your classmates

1717
01:25:01,444 --> 01:25:03,881
broke the sacred
kid vow of silence

1718
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:05,622
and told me what happened
on the day of the test

1719
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:07,102
and what you did for Sam.

1720
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,929
Oh.

1721
01:25:08,973 --> 01:25:10,148
OK.

1722
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:11,671
That's it.

1723
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:14,457
Just be ready for that
test at the end of the day.

1724
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,764
Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

1725
01:25:17,808 --> 01:25:19,592
Who told you?

1726
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:23,161
Sorry, there's a teacher
vow of silence too.

Hey, wake up, sleepy head.

1729
01:26:02,244 --> 01:26:05,029
Come on, you don't want to
be late for your first day

1730
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:06,204
at the big school.

1731
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:07,205
No way.

1732
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:08,119
Come on.

1733

1735

Yes I understand that.

1736
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:50,161
But I have a schedule too.

1737
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,989
Look, let's just talk
about it later, OK?

1738
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:58,300
Your father is driving me crazy.

1739
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:00,302
He's got a meeting
on Friday and he

1740
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:01,955
can't pick you up until 6:00.

1741
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:06,743
But he knows very well that
I have a class that night.

1742
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:09,224
Ah, well, I got an idea.

1743
01:27:09,267 --> 01:27:14,011
I could go to school with you,
hang out at the snack bar,

1744
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:15,839
and he could pick me up there.

1745
01:27:15,882 --> 01:27:17,362
That would work.
That would work.

1746
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:18,189
That's great.

1747
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:22,454
Thank you.

1748
01:27:22,498 --> 01:27:24,761
Oh, you are so my son right now.

1749
01:27:33,987 --> 01:27:35,946
I'm telling you, divorce
can be the greatest thing

1750
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:37,077
that ever happened to you.

1751
01:27:37,121 --> 01:27:37,991
Hey, Tommy.

1752
01:27:38,035 --> 01:27:39,254
Oh, hey, James.

1753
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:42,344
It's all here in my newsletter.

1755
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:44,520
Yeah.

1756
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:47,131
No more baby school.

1757

Whoops, sorry, Karen.

It's OK, Ernie.

I'll see you guys next year.

1760

And I'll see you after school.

1761
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:53,877
Sure.

1762
01:27:56,706 --> 01:27:59,143
Kind of neat to be
taking a bus, huh?

1763
01:27:59,186 --> 01:28:01,406
Nah, I kind of
miss the old bridge.

1764
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,277

you a jelly donut.
