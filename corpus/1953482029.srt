1
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:33,090


2
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,100
Remember when they let commercial airlines land in this town?

3
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,430
Yeah, I don't understand where we're going...

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,660
or why we're bothering anyhow.

5
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,870
- You're doing a good deed. - Wanna give us a better reason.

6
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,500
Yeah. A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30 passengers on it. That's a pretty good reason.

7
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,140
And I got a real bad hunch where those passengers are and who that maniac is.

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,710
You wanna share it with us.

9
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,180
Phoenix.

10
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,950
Simon Phoenix.

11
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,480
Send a maniac to catch one.

12
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,820
Phoenix!

13
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,230
Don't move, Phoenix.

14
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,000
You're under arrest.

15
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,140
Arrest? Shit.

16
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,900
And you're trespassing.

17
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,850
Where are the passengers?

18
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,150
Oh, yes, the passengers.

19
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,700
Well, they're...

20
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,050
Fuck you.

21
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,990
The passengers are gone.

22
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,530
See, I told the city, I said, "Look, nobody comes down here."

23
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,260
Postmen figured it out...

24
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,920
policemen figured it out.

25
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,800
But the goddamn bus drivers just wouldn't listen.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,030
Last time, Phoenix.

27
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,200
Where are the hostages?

28
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,090
To hell with the hostages! This is between you and me!

29
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah.

30
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,510
What, what, what you got soldier boy?

31
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,610
Do something.

32
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,080
Go ahead.

33
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,710
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

34
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,460
I'll set your ass on fire.

35
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,170
Is it cold in here?

36
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,970
Or is it just me?

37
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,110
Where are they, Phoenix?

38
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,010
Now, where did I put them?

39
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,250
I swear, I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.

40
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,010
I'll keep that in mind.

41
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,960
Damn it, John, I'm tired of this demolition-man shit!

42
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,230
You were not supposed to come down here!

43
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,290
You were not supposed to attempt the arrest of Phoenix alone...

44
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,760
and you were not supposed to blow anything up!

45
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,040
It wasn't me this time! He dumped the gas and rigged the place to blow!

46
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,670
Right, you weren't involved.

47
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,410
I know you've tried to nail this psycho for two years.

48
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,520
But remember a thing called...

49
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,410
official police procedure?

50
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,380
- Where are the hostages? - They're not here.

51
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,300
What do you mean they are not here?

52
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,220
He must've stashed them someplace else!

53
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,320
So how do you know they weren't in there. Are you sure?

54
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,760
Because I did a thermo check and there was eight of them, all part of his gang.

55
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,090
Wrong again!

56
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,990
You got something to say, scumbag?

57
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,990
Get him out of here!

58
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,200
Motherfucker!

59
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,670
You and I are going to have a nice long chat.

60
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,490
Captain!

61
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,980
Over here! There're bodies everywhere!

62
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,580
There must be 20 or 30.

63
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,940
They're everywhere.

64
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,950
See that, captain? I told him!

65
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,980
He said he didn't care!

66
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,380
Oh my god. How could you sacrifice all those innocent people for me!

67
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,520
What kind of man are you!

68
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,030
We'll spend a lot of quality time together. See you, sweetie!

69
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,790
Honey! Sugar!

70
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,860
If you got a lawyer, better call him.

71
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,190


72
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,190
John Spartan, you've done great deeds for the city of Los Angeles.

73
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,590
So it is with some regret that I, William Smithers...

74
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,030
acting as Assistant Warden, hereby carry out this sentence.

75
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,870
Skip it.

76
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,930
Sergeant Spartan, you've been sentenced to 70 years...

77
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,640
sub-zero re-habilitation in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

78
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,450
for the involuntary manslaughter of 30 innocent civilians.

79
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,570
Skip it.

80
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,080
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis for the duration of your sentence...

81
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,710
during which your behavior will be altered through synaptic suggestion.

82
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,220
You'll be eligible for parole no earlier than the year 2046.

83
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,330
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

84
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,200


85
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,480
All personnel...

86
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,360
the next scheduled parole hearing for prisoner Gilmour...

87
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,020
will take place at 07:15.

88
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,030
Warden William Smithers, report to Level A, conference room.

89
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,730


90
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,800
Mellow greetings, Warden William Smithers.

91
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,530
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

92
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,170
As it is a beautiful...

93
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,230
Monday morning and as my duty log ...

94
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,910
irrationally requires it. I'm querying you on the prison population.

95
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,750
Does the tedium continue?

96
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,580
Your question is amusing but irrelevant.

97
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,800
The prisoners are ice cubes. They never move.

98
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,150
I find this lack of stimulus to be truly disappointing.

99
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,060
- Don't you think? - I try not to.

100
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,400
However, you're young, think all you want.

101
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,560
Things don't happen anymore, we've taken care of all that.

102
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,470
I'll fiber-op you back after the parole hearings.

103
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,200
Have a peachy day, Lieutenant.

104
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,200
Be well.

105
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,470
Be well.

106
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,940
Vector 137.

107
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,810
Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.

108
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,220
Retina coding accepted.

109
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,020
Warden William Smithers, be well.

110
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,250
Go on.

111
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,320
Self-drive on.

112
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,670
Self-drive engaged.

113
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,160
Coding on.

114
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,230
No police presence is requested in the city at this time.

115
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
Report to the station.

116
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,170
Oh, boy, how exciting.

117
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,650
EF

118
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,150
That's it.

119
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,680
Food, glorious food.

120
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,180
There'll be another one in about 12 hours.

121
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,790
These assholes are predictable.

122
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,490
God, I love to hate this place!

123
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,160
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

124
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,380
That doesn't really matter anymore.

125
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,820
People are hungry.

126
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,900
We've nothing left to lose.

127
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,490


128
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,080
Greetings.

129
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,910
Lovely Lenina.

130
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,080
Greetings, welcome to the emergency line of the SAPD.

131
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,090
If you prefer an automated response, press one now.

132
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,760
Be well.

133
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,830
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

134
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,990
Let me guess, all is serene?

135
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.

136
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
There were defaced public buildings.

137
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,930
Walls smudged with...

138
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,330
scandalous graffiti.

139
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,930
Really?

140
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,100
Brutal. Why wasn't an "all cars" notified?

141
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,010
Because there was no need to create widespread panic.

142
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,650
Lieutenant Huxley...

143
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,750
I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments...

144
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,620
to the warden this morning.

145
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,120
Do you really long for chaos and disharmony?

146
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,960
Your fascination with the 20th century seems to be affecting your better judgment.

147
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,300
You realize you're setting a bad example for other officers and personnel.

148
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,130
Thank you for the attitude readjustment.

149
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,040
Info assimilated.

150
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,480
Sanctimonious asshole.

151
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,350
Lenina Huxley, you are fined 1/2 credit...

152
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,790
for a 'sotto voce' violation of the verbal morality statute.

153
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,750
Thank you.

154
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,330
That was tense.

155
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,330
- That was tense? - Yes.

156
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,270
Tell me something, Garcia...

157
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,400
Don't you get bored code tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

158
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,010
Actually no. I find my job deeply fulfilling.

159
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,680
I just can't get over the reality of this office, Lenina Huxley.

160
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,180
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

161
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,190
High from its harshness. Buzzed by its brutality.

162
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,290
Holy smokes!

163
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,690
Is there anything in this office which doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

164
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,300
Only you, Alfredo Garcia.

165
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,790
Don't you ever want something to happen?

166
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,800
Goodness, no.

167
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,370
I knew you'd say that.

168
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,710
What I wouldn't give for some action.

169
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,350
Mr. Simon Phoenix.

170
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,850
One of our first and most illustrious members.

171
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,220
Allow me to...

172
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,700
welcome you to your parole hearing.

173
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,700
Let's get this over quickly.

174
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,610
Twenty-nine years ago, the parole system, as you know it...

175
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,100
was rendered obsolete.

176
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,540
Federal Statute 537-29...

177
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,080
Stop it!

178
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,560
Do you have anything fresh to say on your behalf?

179
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,560
I thought not.

180
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,800
Yeah, I do.

181
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,560
Teddy bear.

182
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,150
How'd you know the password?

183
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,150
I wish I knew.

184
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,990
Simon says, die.

185
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,610
Warden...

186
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,220

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,990
Be well.

189
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,500
Yeah, you too.

190
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,640

Oh, my!

193
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,250
I don't believe it!

194
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,010
Northwest quadrant. 187.

195
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,850
What's a 187?

196
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,150
I don't know.

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,260

died August 4th, 2032.

220
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,560
What's the matter with all of you? 

221
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,790
The cryo-prison, sir. Three non-sanctioned life terminations.

222
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,130
Do you wish to assign a coroner?

223
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,800
MurderDeathKills?!

224
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,230
Three MDKs!

225
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,630
Access for me the cryo-pen's morning hearing schedule.

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,650
Who?

234
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,760
Simon Phoenix.

235
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,860
- Phoenix, Simon. - I knew him.

236
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,990
He's evil in a way you've never read about.

237
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,430
He's a criminal the likes of which you have never seen.

238
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,440
Hold that thought, Zachary Lamb.

239
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,970
Simon Phoenix's code, now.

240
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,700

241
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,280
- No code found. - L7, are you coming down with another virus, are you?

242
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,580
- Of course not. - You don't get it, Lenina Huxley.

243
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,190
Phoenix isn't coded.

244
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,350
He was chilled in the 20th...

245
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,550
before they started lo-jacking everybody.

246
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,900
Declared his own kingdom in South Central L.A.

247
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,960
In a bad time...

248
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,800
- he was the worst. - Emergency, code 187.

249
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,040
Emergency, code 187.

250
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,560
Locating stopped code.

251
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,870

256
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,930
187, deceased.

257
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,160
Do you wish to assign a coroner?

258
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Tell me L7, is the doctor's conveyance still in the parking zone?

259
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,160
The answer is no. Car missing.

260
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,970
Doctor's conveyance is not in parking zone. It is in motion.

261
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,940
Locate precise code-fix on doctor's conveyance.

262
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,500

267
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,450
Approaching the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevard.

268
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,930
Glorious.

269
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,090
Fine work.

270
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,570
All nearby units, ProtectServe...

271
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,930
Wilshire and Santa Monica.

272
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,100
- Unit 12 ProtectServe. - Apprehend fugitive.

273
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,400
Proceed with extreme assertiveness.

274
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,510
Doctor's vehicle has been code-fixed.

275
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,940
Approaching the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevard.

276
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,140
I don't know. Lately I just don't feel like there's anything special about me.

277
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,730
You are an incredibly sensitive man...

278
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,640
who inspires joy-joy feelings in all those around you.

279
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,220
- Get out of here! - Excuse me.

280
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,950
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,320
Greetings, Citizen! How are you feeling on this glorious day?

282
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,930
You look great today!

283
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,600
I feel good too.

284
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,140
Angeles Information Network. Automated banking.

285
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,830
Damn, I'm possessed.

286
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,500
I wonder if I can play the accordion too.

287
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,500
File code accepted.

288
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,100
Friendly, Edgar. Code level 60.

289
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,720
Listed offenses: civil unrest...

290
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,300
Don't you hear a thought repeating in that barbaric brain of yours?

291
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,300
The name Friendly, Edgar?

292
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,960
Edgar Friendly.

293
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,460
Don't you have a job to do?

294
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,840
Don't you have someone to kill?

295
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,800
Someone to kill.

296
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,470
Someone to kill.

297
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,990
Gun noun. Portable firearm.

298
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,900
This device was widely utilized in the urban wars of the late 20th century.

299
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,860
Referred to as a "pistol".

300
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,660
Look, I don't need a history lesson. Come on, hell. Where are the goddamn guns?

301
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:02,400
You are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute.

302
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,800
What? Fuck you.

303
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,800
Your repeated violation of the verbal morality statute has caused me to notify the police.

304
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Please remain where you are for your reprimand.

305
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,980
Yeah, right.

306
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Fuckers are fast too.

307
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,860
You are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute.

308
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,870
ProtectServe in place.

309
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,430
4 minutes, 15 seconds lapse.

310
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,970
Maniac is imminent. Request advice.

311
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,000
With a firm tone of voice...

312
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,220
demand maniac lie down with hands behind back.

313
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,640
Simon Phoenix!

314
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,610
Lie down with your hands behind your back!

315
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,250
What's this?

316
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,200
Six of you. Such nice tidy uniforms.

317
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,150
Oh, I'm so scared.

318
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,560
What? You guys don't have sarcasm anymore?

319
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,700
Maniac responded scornfully.

320
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,610
Approach and repeat ultimatum...

321
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,950
in an even firmer tone of voice. Add the words, "or else".

322
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,750
Simon Phoenix! Lie down on the ground...

323
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,820
or else!

324
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,500
Anti-Graffiti Activation Program...

325
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600

326
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Aborted.

327
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,790
Human presence detected.

328
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,000
Safety override code accepted.

329
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Lucky number seven.

330
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,300
We're police officers!

331
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,690
We're not trained to handle violence!

332
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,930
Wait for me!

333
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,590
Stupid.

334
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,670
Simon says, everybody sing!

335
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,170
"And the home

336
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,900
Of the brave"

337
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,520
Play ball!

338
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,720
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

339
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,370
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

340
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,070
He's going for the vehicle's battery coil.

341
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,370
It's pure capacitance gel.

342
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,000
The problem is not the defacement of public buildings or...

343
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,350
the noise pollution caused by the exploding devices.

344
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,090
Allow me to explain.

345
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,900
The real problem lies in the man whose initials...

346
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,700
mark the detonating graffiti...

347
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,570
on the streets of our peaceful city.

348
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,610
The man behind the "EF"...

349
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,410
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

350
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,880
For a sadly extended period of time...

351
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,980
we in San Angeles...

352
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,900
have been plagued by a pack of subterranean hooligans.

353
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,420
You will come to know them as "scraps".

354
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Men and women who have left the comfort of our society...

355
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,400
only to spew hostility...

356
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,000
at the very bottom they have relinquished.

357
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,440
There was a time when we used to look upon these scraps...

358
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,270
as rather pathetic and relatively harmless.

359
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,440
Now they have a leader.

360
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,410
Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition...

361
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,580
to infect our harmony with his venom.

362
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,710
He must, of course...

363
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,120
be stopped.

364
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,450
This radical terrorist behavior, led by Mr. Friendly...

365
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,700
must not be allowed to undermine our safety.

366
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,590
Safety Above All.

367
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,430
I expect your trust, confidence and certitude.

368
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,970
Excuse me.

369
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,500
Dr. Cocteau...

370
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,480
a cryo-con has effected self-release from the penitentiary.

371
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,350
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills, all categories of chaos.

372
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,380
Enhance your calm.

373
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,050
Be well them for me.

374
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,160
Get me Captain George Earle immediately.

375
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
It was just...

376
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,680
I mean it was so...

377
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,110
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

378
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,010
It was fun for him.

379
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,510
I want you to do everything in your power to snare this agent of destruction.

380
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,740
You have my utmost confidence.

381
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,750
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

382
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,510
Be well.

383
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,600
"Utmost confidence."

384
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,430
"Everything in our power".

385
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,930
What else is there?

386
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,840
Zachary Lamb...

387
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,540
how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix apprehended back in the 20th?

388
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,110
Twelve-state manhunt.

389
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,620
Satellite surveillance.

390
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,120
A video bite on "Unsolved Mysteries".

391
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,280
None of them worked.

392
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,060
In the end, it took just one man.

393
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,300
One cop.

394
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,270
John Spartan.

395
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,460
John Spartan?

396
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,970
That's right.

397
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,660
They called him the "Demolition Man".

398
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,950
Spartan file 98345, LAPD.

399
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,210
Spartan file 98761C, LAPD.

400
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,350
Are you sure this is real life?

401
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,850
Barely.

402
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,320
Spartan's a legend.

403
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,730
I've been doing a historical study. Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

404
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,750
All authentic criminals.

405
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,220
There was a lot more business back then.

406
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,670
How can you justify destroying a $7 million mini mall...

407
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,540
to rescue a girl whose ransom is only $25,000?

408
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,000
Fuck you, lady.

409
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,670
Good answer.

410
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,840
This is your recommendation?!

411
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,280
The Demolition Man's an animal.

412
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,590
He's clearly the man for a job such as this. You could reinstate him.

413
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,650
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

414
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,190
who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

415
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,290
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.

416
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,360
We need an old-fashioned cop.

417
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,450
Biofax 312-618 is ready for regular routine inspection.

418
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,410
John Spartan, 5864.

419
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,740
Pulmonary activity approaching normal.

420
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,280
Body temperature, 63% and rising.

421
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,250
Biolink engaged.

422
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,520
Laser defibrillation sequence started.

423
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,860
Plasma transfer in 15 seconds.

424
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,260
Plasma transfer, 10 seconds...

425
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,930
8 seconds...

426
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,870
6 seconds...

427
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,530
Plasma transfer complete.

428
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,770
MTL complete.

429
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,290
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

430
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,570
by releasing another one?

431
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,560
I am unconvinced.

432
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,070
This is within the powers of the police charter, sir.

433
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,080
He can be released on limited parole and reinstated to active duty.

434
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,910
It's not enough to collect the '90s, you have to bring the man's life?

435
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,580
Dr. Cocteau said everything within our power.

436
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,250
I can't think of a better idea.

437
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,610
That still doesn't mean it's a good one.

438
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,750
This man comes from a dissimilar method of law enforcement.

439
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,090
I'm not sure he's any different than Simon Phoenix himself.

440
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,250
Detective?

441
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,740
Detective, I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

442
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,770
The year is 2032.

443
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,600
Now, the reason you have been released is...

444
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,940
How long have I been under?

445
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,180
36 years.

446
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,950
I had a wife.

447
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,290
What happened to my wife?

448
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,520
Her life was extinguished in the Big One of 2010.

449
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,690
She died.

450
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,300
In an earthquake.

451
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,460
The earthquake.

452
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,460
I had a daughter.

453
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,640
What happened to her?

454
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,800
John Spartan.

455
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,250
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

456
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,690
We didn't thaw you out for a family reunion.

457
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,880
Consider it fortunate that the lieutenant even bother did a probe on your wife.

458
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,650
This is about you and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

459
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,290
What?

460
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,440
This morning Simon Phoenix escaped from this cryo-facility.

461
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,990
We've had 11 murderdeathkills so far.

462
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,400
You see, we've become a society of peace-loving...

463
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,900
and, and understanding and we are, quite frankly...

464
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,120
not equipped to deal with this situation.

465
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,670
There have been no deaths of unnatural causes in San Angeles for the last 16 years.

466
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,910
Where?

467
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,450
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Diego Metroplex were merged in 2011.

468
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,550
You are in the center what used to be Los Angeles.

469
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,350
That's great.

470
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,960
- You, get me a Marlboro. - Yes, of course. Right away.

471
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,520
What's a Marlboro?

472
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,030
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

473
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:44,100
Smoking is not good for you. Anything not good for you is bad.

474
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,210
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat...

475
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,750
Are you shitting me?

476
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,390
John Spartan, you are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute.

477
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,090
What the hell is that?

478
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,290
- John Spartan, you are fined one credit... - Bad language...

479
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,060
chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys and anything spicy.

480
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,800
Abortion is also illegal, but then, so is pregnancy if you don't have a license.

481
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,790
Caveman...

482
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,230
let's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle and get moving.

483
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,730
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.

484
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,070
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

485
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,140
when I finally bring him down you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble.

486
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,140
Thanks, but no thanks.

487
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,780
The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

488
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,320
and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix.

489
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,460
Or...

490
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,920
you can go back into cryo-stasis.

491
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,160
Not many people get a second chance, John Spartan.

492
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,370
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

493
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,140
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

494
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,910
Where's John Spartan?

495
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,140
He went to the bathroom. I guess he got all thawed out.

496
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,160
Sir, I formally convey my presence.

497
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,200
How are you doing?

498
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,100
We're not used to physical-contact greetings.

499
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,330
I don't know...

500
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
if you guys know it but...

501
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,490
you're out of toilet paper.

502
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,240
Did you say toilet paper?

503
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,680
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

504
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,780
back in the 20th.

505
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,610
I'm happy that you're happy, but the place we used to supposed to have a toilet paper...

506
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,350
you've got a little shelf with three sea shells.

507
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,520
He doesn't know how to use the three seashells.

508
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,500
I can see how that'd be confusing.

509
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,340
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

510
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,130
Zach? Zach Lamb?

511
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,700
What happened to you?

512
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,550
I got older.

513
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,820
My God, I remember when you were...

514
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,210
a rookie pilot.

515
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,360
They finally grounded me.

516
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

517
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,160
You're fined two credits for violation of the verbal morality statute.

518
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,260
I'll be right back.

519
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,060
They seem to be friends...

520
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
yet he speaks to him in the most profane manner.

521
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,400
If you'd read my study, you'd know this is how heterosexual men bonded.

522
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,130
I knew that.

523
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,850
Thanks a lot you shit-brained, fuck-faced, duck-fucking...

524
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,270
- pain in the ass. - You're fined five credits...

525
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,110
for repeated violations of the verbal morality statute.

526
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,650
So much for the sea shells.

527
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,480
See you in a few minutes.

528
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,530
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix was not coded.

529
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,500
While you're sleeping, everyone in the city was installed code.

530
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,870
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau. An organic microchip...

531
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,140
is sewn into the skin.

532
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,440
Sensors all over the city can zero in on anyone at any time.

533
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,350
I can't even conceive what you police officers did before it was developed.

534
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,580
We worked. This fascist crap makes me want to puke.

535
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,850
What do you think you're scratching?

536
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,280
You really think we'd let you go without control?

537
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,860
Your code was implanted the second you thawed.

538
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,450
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?

539
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,270
You dirty meat-eater!

540
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,400
No matter how Viking your era was...

541
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,600
I cannot digest how you ever wore a badge!

542
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,600
You're going back, John Spartan, oh, yes, you're going back!

543
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,710
Could you two please dump some hormones?!

544
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,010
We need every cortex we can get in this situation.

545
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,950
We don't need the Neanderthal.

546
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,810
Our computer has already examined every scenario...

547
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,390
resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix.

548
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,490
It's determined he'll try to set up a drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

549
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,060
That is correct.

550
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,250
I hate to interrupt you two...

551
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,990
but that's fucking stupid.

552
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,530
You think he wants to start a business?

553
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,600
Phoenix is going for a gun.

554
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,670
Plain and simple.

555
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,270
Trust me.

556
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,430
He's going for a gun.

557
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,210
Who cares what this primate thinks?

558
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,140
Resonate some understanding.

559
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,290
The only place a person can even view a gun in this city...

560
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,840
is at a museum.

561
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,920
Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History.

562
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,390
Beneath you you'll see an excavation...

563
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,690
of an actual 20th century street scene...

564
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,570
in downtown Los Angeles, preserved since the earthquake of 2010.

565
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,590
For specific information on objects featured in the exhibit...

566
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,340
Firearms are displayed in the Armory...

567
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,410
located on Level A.

568
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,710
You are now entering the Hall of Violence...

569
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,980
a visual representation of the primitive behavior prevalent...

570
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,390
during the late 20th century.

571
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,820
Home, sweet home.

572
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,900
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix was able to locate the cache of firearms...

573
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,960
it'd be impossible for him to remove them.

574
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,830
She's right. They're located in a maximum security armory exhibit.

575
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,340
Just a hunch. Trust me.

576
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,910
It's a cop thing.

577
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,700
And what am I, a frog?

578
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,380
Excuse me.

579
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,020
I'll drive.

580
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,430
Resetting all bio-links for new driver.

581
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,900
Weight, height, peripheral vision set.

582
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,100
If you would like...

583
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,870
to commence transportation, John Spartan, initialize sequence now.

584
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,770
You drive.

585
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,150
Welcome, Lenina Huxley.

586
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,120
You seem very much alone, John Spartan, but...

587
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,460
things aren't all that different.

588
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,720
Perhaps you'd like to hear an oldies station?

589
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,360
Oh, what a relief it is.

590
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,560
This is the most popular station in the town.

591
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,330
Wall to wall mini-tunes. You called them "commercials".

592
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,740
The classic you've all been waiting for.

593
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,510
The number one request today: "Armour Hot Dogs".

594
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,480
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs..."

595
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,680
This is my fave!

596
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,910
"Skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks"

597
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,060
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...

598
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,710
chicken pox love hot dogs"

599
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
"Armour Hot Dogs"

600
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,550
"The dogs kids love to bite."

601
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,170
Someone put me back in the fridge.

602
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,070
You are now entering the armory exhibit.

603
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,440
Here you will find displays in the cabinets and walls...

604
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,170
So sorry. Didn't see you there.

605
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,880
Sweet baby.

606
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,220
Oh, shit.

607
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,760
Yes. Now this is what I'm talking about.

608
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,100
How do I get in here?

609
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:32,210
Is there a 15 day waiting period? Or can I just take one now?

610
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,260
Motherfucker.

611
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,040
Oh, fuck it.

612
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,290
Mellow greetings.

613
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,720
What seems to be your boggle?

614
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,390
My boggle?

615
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,120
How much do you weigh?

616
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,220
I weigh...

617
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,360
Please vacate the museum, patrons.

618
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,670
Be calm.

619
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,030
Please vacate...

620
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,870
the museum, patrons. Be calm.

621
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,410
Wait a minute, this is the future.

622
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,540
Where are all the phaser guns?

623
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,320
Mellow greetings, sir.

624
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,160
What's your boggle?

625
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,000
Warning, please exit rapidly.

626
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,200
The magnetic accelerator gun...

627
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,900
the last hand-held weapon of this millennium, displaced the flow of neutrons...

628
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,440
through a nonlinear cycloid electromagnetic accumulator.

629
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,510
So, what? It needs batteries?

630
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,880
What size? I mean where the fuck do you find batteries?

631
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,820
Is there a battery store around?

632
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,860
Excuse me, museum patron. Can l...

633
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,860
Where's Radio Shack?

634
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,640
Sweet music to my ears.

635
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,540
The magnetic accelerator gun will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes.

636
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,870
I was thinking about leaving quickly. Patience is not one of my virtues.

637
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,720
Did you see that?

638
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,950
What?

639
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,330
Never mind. I give up trying to figure this place out.

640
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,660
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.

641
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,000
Access and correlate procedure.

642
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,610
Establish communication with intruder.

643
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,840
Wrong.

644
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,090
- Luke Skywalker, use the Force. - Oh, dear.

645
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,450
- What the hell is this? - It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

646
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,610
Does it work?

647
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,850
Guess so.

648
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,410
He's trapped in section 8.

649
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,100
I doubt it, Huxley. Make sure the building's clear.

650
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,050
Done. I want a visual.

651
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,500
Now, every corridor of the museum, I want full sensors routed to me.

652
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,700
You guys wait here. Give me 10 minutes.

653
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,380
Museum patron, you are now confined to the armory.

654
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,080
Museum patron, you are now confined to the Armory.

655
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,150
The armory exhibit is now sealed.

656
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,390
All museum patrons still in the facility should remain calm.

657
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,790
Help is imminent.

658
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,070
This museum is no longer sealed, isn't it?

659
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,300
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

660
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,980
You should've stayed there.

661
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,670
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

662
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,850
Bad aim, blondie.

663
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,680
Spartan? John Spartan?

664
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,530
Oh, shit. They let anybody into this century! What're you doing here?

665
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:14,920
Simon says, bleed!

666
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,760
Great. Just great.

667
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,700
You're making it too easy for me, Phoenix.

668
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,000
Come on, you piece of shit!

669
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,270
So let me get this right.

670
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:31,340
They defrosted you just so you could lasso my piddly ass?

671
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,610
I've dreamed about killing you for 40 years.

672
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,840
Keep dreamin'!

673
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,150
Magnetic accelerator activated.

674
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,550
About time.

675
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,780
Past is over!

676
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,650
Time for something new and improved!

677
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,350
Oh, hell.

678
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,420
Shit! I love this gun!

679
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,440
How do you like the future?

680
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,540
Come on!

681
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,490
Oh, I know that must hurt!

682
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,170
Huh, soldier boy?

683
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,850
You're on TV!

684
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,120
Oh, shit!

685
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,600
You're dead!

686
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,640
Forgot to say, "Simon says".

687
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,770
Oh, shit.

688
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,580
Good one.

689
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,600
Such a brand new world. Sorry you must go!

690
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,650
Shit!

691
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,520
Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans.

692
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,950
Someone will pay dearly for this.

693
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:39,030
Sir, the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak.

694
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,300
Shit. Being frozen must have thrown my aim off.

695
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,740
Don't wrong. I'll get you with the next shot.

696
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,400
I don't think so.

697
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,210
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

698
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,120
You were doing so well.

699
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,920
Now don't you have a job to do?

700
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:06,320
Isn't there a thought repeating in your barbaric brain?

701
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,320
The name Friendly.

702
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,560
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

703
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,230
Don't you have someone to kill?

704
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,940
- Yeah, I do. - Excellent.

705
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,520
Then go and do your job.

706
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,120
Shit.

707
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,480
Saved by the bell.

708
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,750
Shit!

709
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,100
Damn!

710
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,270
You don't know how lucky you're he didn't whack you.

711
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,690
Well, I must say that whacking, whatever it is, sounds most disagreeable.

712
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,610
You scared him away.

713
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,310
I don't know how to thank you. You saved my life.

714
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,570
No problem.

715
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,120
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

716
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:14,260
Simon Phoenix knows he has some competition.

717
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,660
He's finally matched his meat.

718
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,960
You really licked his ass.

719
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,830
That's "met his match"...

720
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,030
and "kicked his ass."

721
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,080
"Met his match and kicked his ass".

722
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,510
Captain Earle...

723
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,110
Who is this man?

724
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,300
Detective John Spartan, temporarily reinstated to the San Angeles...

725
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,290
Police Department to pursue the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

726
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,320
You told us to do everything in our power to capture the bad man.

727
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,220
Oh, Yes, yes, I did, I did.

728
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,590
Yes, I do recall the exploits of Mr. John Spartan.

729
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,360
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

730
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,970
That's quite all right.

731
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,830
Unexpected. Creative.

732
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,610
But quite all right.

733
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,580
John Spartan, welcome.

734
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,710
In honor of your arrival...

735
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,250
and your protection of the sanctity of human life...

736
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,050
namely my own...

737
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,880
I would like to invite you to join me for dinner tonight.

738
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,220
The both of you.

739
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,920
Please, I insist.

740
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,090
I would like you to accompany me...

741
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,060
to Taco Bell.

742
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,290
Look forward to it. Thank you.

743
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,130
- Taco Bell? - Yes.

744
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,240
So let me get this right:

745
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,320
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

746
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,650
who wants to take me to dinner to Taco Bell...

747
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,440
and I wouldn't mind a burrito...

748
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,560
who is also the guy builts the goddamn cryo-prison?

749
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,990
John Spartan, you are fined one...

750
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,230
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man in San Angeles.

751
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,170
He practically created our whole way of life...

752
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,170
- savage. - Yeah.

753
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,160
He can have it.

754
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,940
Now, Phoenix could be anywhere...

755
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,800
but not being coded can limit him.

756
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:07,000
That is correct. Money is outmoded.

757
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,100
All transactions are through codes.

758
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,810
So he can't buy food or a place to stay for the night.

759
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,680
It'd be a waste of time to mug someone.

760
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,850
Unless he rips off someone's hand.

761
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,850
But with officers patrolling...

762
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,360
it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before...

763
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,460
We already have a backup plan.

764
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,030
We can wait for another code to go red.

765
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,370
When Phoenix performs another MurderDeathKill...

766
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,800
we'll know exactly where to pounce.

767
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,640
Great plan.

768
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:38,940
Thank you.

769
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,110
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades for quite some time now.

770
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,500
In fact, I perused some visuals from the Schwarzenegger Library.

771
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,150
Hold it.

772
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,720
The Schwarzenegger Library?

773
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,660
Yes, the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library.

774
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,420
Wasn't he an actor?

775
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,660
- Stop. He was President? - Yes.

776
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:08,170
Even though he wasn't born in this country, his popularity caused the 61 Amendment.

777
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,730
I don't want to know.

778
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,840
President.

779
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,010
What hell is this? No door? No welcome mat?

780
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,820
What is this?

781
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,190
How do they expect you to kill somebody?

782
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,300
Oh, shit, I love that smell. Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

783
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,680
All right. A job is a job.

784
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,130
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you're, prepare for Simon Phoenix.

785
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,270
So what's with the Cocteau guy anyway?

786
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,820
He says I saved his life, which I'm not sure I did.

787
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,820
My reward is dinner and dancing at Taco Bell?

788
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,920
I like Mexican food, but...

789
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,220
Your tone is quasi-facetious. But...

790
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,400
you do not realize that Taco Bell is the only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars.

791
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,420
- So? - So.

792
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,460
Now all restaurants are Taco Bell.

793
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,930
No way.

794
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,070
Welcome to Taco Bell.

795
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,140
Enjoy your meal.

796
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:36,480
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

797
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,260
"Good things from the garden"

798
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,660
"Garden in the valley"

799
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,490
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

800
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,170
Here comes the Neanderthal.

801
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,240
Mr. Spartan over there please, and Lieutenant...

802
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,670
Thank you.

803
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,580
How are you doing?

804
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,250
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

805
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,010
Good thing I'm hungry.

806
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:11,690
Ladies and gentlemen, please raise your glasses to the hero of the hour...

807
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,860
my savior

808
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,110
Detective John Spartan.

809
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,160
Appreciate it.

810
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,710
Greetings and salutations.

811
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,540
I'm Associate Bob.

812
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:31,440
We met before, ever so briefly. I was so, probably in fear at the time.

813
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,420
Do you have the salt?

814
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,390
Salt is not good for you, hence it is illegal.

815
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,090
So, John Spartan, tell me...

816
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:45,060
what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

817
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,560
I thought the future would be a rotten cesspool.

818
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,460
You weren't here when the real disturbances began.

819
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,230
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

820
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,840
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.

821
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,740
People stayed home, afraid to go out. People wanted the madness over.

822
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,650
When I saw the chance to make things right...

823
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,290
I seized it.

824
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:15,060
If I had not, the radiance of San Angeles would not be here.

825
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Just your rotting cesspool of hate and suffering. Which would you prefer?

826
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,040
Can you book me a flight out of here when the sermon's over?

827
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,330
John Spartan...

828
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,870
for your crimes you would surely have died...

829
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,170
in jail before now.

830
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,320
Even you must appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity...

831
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,280
of the cryo-prison system?

832
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:43,020
I don't want to spoil your dinner, but my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

833
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,050
I had feelings and thoughts.

834
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,690
A 36-year nightmare about people caught in a burning building.

835
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,200
You were awake? I don't think so.

836
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,690
I think so.

837
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:57,140
My wife beating her fists against a block of ice that used to be her husband.

838
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,210
Then you're nice, wake me up and let me know everything that meant something to my life is gone.

839
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:07,510
It would have been more humane to leave me to the fucking crows.

840
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,720
What would you say if I called you a brutish fossil...

841
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,710
symbolic of the decayed era gratefully forgotten?

842
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,280
I don't know. "Thanks"?

843
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,220
I thought during rehabilitation...

844
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:24,390
the prisoners were not conscious. A person would go insane.

845
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,460
The side effects of the cryo-process...

846
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:27,960
are unavoidable.

847
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,090
You were found guilty of a crime.

848
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,160
You owed and still owe a debt to society.

849
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,500
There's nothing I can do.

850
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:36,300
Yes, call for backup. I'll be across the street.

851
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,940
Where're you going?

852
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,010
Bad guys about to do bad things. It's just one of those hunches.

853
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,760
Go for the truck!

854
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,770
The food's in the truck!

855
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,430
Grab the big box! Come on, move, move, move!

856
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,410
You'll regret this all your life. Both seconds of it.

857
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,120
Good night!

858
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,240
Get him!

859
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,500
What a fucking hero. Come on.

860
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,270
Please, don't.

861
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,510
What the hell?

862
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,210
Such reckless abandonment.

863
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,440
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.

864
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,050
That's "sheriff". Who are those guys?

865
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,450
They're known as scraps.

866
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,120
Outcasts and deserters who choose to live beneath us...

867
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,850
in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

868
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,260
They're a constant irritation to our harmony.

869
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,030
They're nothing but thugs and hooligans.

870
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,700
A society of thieves. The last remaining criminal element in the city.

871
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:51,210
But plans are in progress to purge this peril from our day.

872
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,150
You're even better live than on laser disk.

873
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,230
The way you paused to make a witticism before doing battle...

874
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,170
with that Scrap...

875
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,890
Huxley, this isn't the Wild West, okay?

876
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,490
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.

877
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,390
Hurting people isn't a good thing.

878
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,320
Sometimes it is, but not...

879
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,990
when it's people looking for something to eat.

880
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:22,570
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

881
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,070
Coding off.

882
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,340
Auto-drive.

883
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,430
Auto-drive engaged.

884
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,010
Look I'm sorry I yelled at you.

885
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,690
No need for a de-hurtful retraction.

886
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,950
I assimilated too much contraband.

887
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,530
I fleshed you out as a blow-up-the-bad-guy-while-grinning type.

888
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:52,080
But I realize, you're the moody-gunslinger-who-will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

889
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:52,900
Stop.

890
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,940
What?

891
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:56,240
I just do my job and things get...

892
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,260
Demolished.

893
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,780
You know I keep looking around, I think of my daughter growing up in a place like this.

894
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,750
I'm afraid she'll think I'm some kind of primitive.

895
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,720
As much as I want to see her, I almost don't want to.

896
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,620
Because I don't think I'll fit in well.

897
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,230
Not at all.

898
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,710
- It'd be a minor misuse of police powers, but I could do a search for you. - No.

899
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,740
Sorry.

900
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:39,350
Subject change. I got what you wanted.

901
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,480
Great.

902
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:45,950
What do you need that for?

903
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,090
It's just one of those cop hunches.

904
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:00,500
Lights.

905
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:03,440
No. I've changed that.

906
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,940
Illuminate.

907
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,770
Deluminate.

908
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,420
Isn't that nicer?

909
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,180
Go ahead, you try.

910
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,390
Illuminate.

911
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,790
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.

912
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,660
How did you get in?

913
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,860
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

914
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,590
Routes to underground kingdoms.

915
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,500
Complete access to the industrial data-grid interface.

916
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,870
I don't even know what that means.

917
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,590
But I've been meaning to ask you.

918
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,760
Because I like it! I like it a lot!

919
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:45,380
You have these skills for a reason.

920
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,550
Not for your personal amusement.

921
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:53,520
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly and stop a revolution.

922
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,720
That is why you were rehabilitated.

923
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,890
All right. I'm going to do your dastardly deed for you.

924
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,810
But it'll be more difficult than you thought.

925
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,470
I'm going to need some help.

926
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,410
I'll need about five or six more "special" men.

927
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,740
And I just so happen to have a list.

928
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,950
You see, I wouldn't want you to defrost any of those maddog killer types, you know what I mean?

929
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:24,720
And none of those motherfuckers from New York. They're too uptight.

930
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,090
So you're going to be the only maddog killer type?

931
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,190
Fine.

932
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,600
Take care of it.

933
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,530
Just get it over with.

934
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,100
You're beginning to be more trouble than you're worth.

935
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,020
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

936
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,270
And what do I get out of all this?

937
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,110
What do you want?

938
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,720
Malibu.

939
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:58,820
Santa Monica. Hell, what about all the coastal cities?

940
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:01,560
I'll bear it in mind.

941
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,720
- Good, I'll send you a memo. - Just do your job!

942
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,130
What is John Spartan doing here?

943
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,730
Did you invite him to this little party of ours?

944
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,700
Look, you finish your business...

945
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,010
and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

946
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,350
Think of him as a guarantee.

947
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,140
A guarantee?

948
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:29,180
You don't have much of a guarantee.

949
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,720
I took care of Spartan once, I'll take care of him again.

950
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,760
Now we need those men defrosted.

951
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,100
So this is where you live, Huxley?

952
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,670
Very not bad.

953
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,830
Thank you.

954
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,600
Where will I be staying?

955
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:54,010
I've procured you a domicile down the corridor from my own.

956
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,480
Everything is voice coded, so if you need something, just ask.

957
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:01,780
Lights.

958
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,720
What do you think?

959
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,460
Clicked off a lot of credits to create a 20th century apartment.

960
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:10,960
It's very...

961
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,190
Isn't it?

962
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,470
John Spartan...

963
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,810
There's a course say, well-known...

964
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:24,130
and documented connection between sex and violence.

965
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,970
Not so much a causal effect...

966
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,210
but a general state of neurological arousal.

967
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,050
And...

968
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:36,710
after having observed your behavior this evening and...

969
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,360
my resultant condition...

970
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,250
I was wondering if you'd like to have sex?

971
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,500
With you?

972
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,240
Here?

973
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,400
Now?

974
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:02,680
Great!

975
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,920
I'll be right back.

976
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,040
Love boat?

977
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,590
Here.

978
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:56,300
Now, just relax. We'll begin in a few seconds.

979
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,130
Begin what?

980
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,740
Having sex, of course.

981
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,620
What's wrong? You broke contact.

982
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,190
Contact? I didn't even touch you yet.

983
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,190
I thought, you wanted to make love.

984
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,640
Is that what you call this?

985
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:14,810
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves during transference of sexual energies.

986
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,540
All right. Let's do it the old-fashioned way.

987
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,880
Disgusting!

988
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,020
You mean...

989
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:26,940
- fluid transfer? - No, I mean boning, the wild mambo.

990
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,060
That is no longer done.

991
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,370
The exchange of bodily fluids, do you know what that leads to?

992
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,060
yeah, I do

993
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,330
Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.

994
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:40,670
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one of the major reasons of the downfall of the society.

995
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:43,900
After AIDS, there was NRS, after NRS, there was UBT.

996
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:47,500
One of the first things Dr. Cocteau was able to do was outlaw...

997
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,670
and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer out of socially acceptable behavior.

998
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,580
Not even, not even a mouth transfer's condoned.

999
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,120
Kissing's not allowed?!

1000
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:57,760
Damn, I was a good kisser.

1001
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,860
What about kids?

1002
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,860
Procreation?

1003
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,690
We go to a lab.

1004
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,920
Fluids are purified, screened...

1005
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,360
and transferred by authorized medical personnel only.

1006
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,440
It is the only legal way.

1007
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,860
What're you doing?

1008
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,370
Breaking the law.

1009
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,480
You are a savage creature, John Spartan.

1010
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,410
And I wish you to leave my domicile. Now!

1011
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:34,290
You know...

1012
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,410
Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.

1013
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,920
Lights.

1014
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,510
"He doesn't know how to use the three sea shells."

1015
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,750
"Behavioral engineering"?

1016
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:16,810
Hi, Marty, I was thinking... Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.

1017
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,780


1018
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,380
Our noble facility has been desecrated...

1019
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,750
Someone will pay dearly for this.

1020
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,840
Sir, the stress breeder is inside being demobilized.

1021
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,590
Shit! Being frozen must've thrown my aim off.

1022
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,060
The next shot.

1023
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,850
I don't think so.

1024
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,090
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

1025
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,040
- Detective. - I'm sorry about last night.

1026
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,370
This is for you.

1027
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,250
For me?

1028
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,290
Thank you.

1029
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,620
I'll drive.

1030
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,630
- I must learn to do this once in my life. - OK.

1031
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,070
Thank you for the gift.

1032
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:50,190
Look I don't know what you guys do in my cryo-sludge but when I thawed, the first thing I wanted to do is knit.

1033
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,750
I mean, how come I know what a zipperfoot, a shuttle and a bobbin is?

1034
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:58,260
I could weave a throw rug now with my eyes closed.

1035
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,600
It's part of your rehab program.

1036
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:03,660
For each inmate the computer draws up a skill or trade...

1037
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,670
which best suited to their genetic disposition.

1038
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,430
It implants the knowledge...

1039
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:10,010
and the desire to carry out whatever, the training assigned.

1040
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,830
I'm a seamstress?

1041
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,610
That's just great.

1042
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,340
I come out of cryo-prison and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

1043
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,090
Phoenix comes out, can access computers, operate all vehicles...

1044
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:23,420
knows the location of every damn thing in town...

1045
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,490
and three times stronger than when he was in.

1046
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,190
- Can you get me Phoenix's rehab program now? - Sure.

1047
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,610
- I'm a seamstress. - Access code for Simon Phoenix.

1048
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,800
Access Simon Phoenix.

1049
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,630
Accessing.

1050
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,030
Access denied.

1051
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,810
- What? - Security override.

1052
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,370
It can't be right.

1053
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,650
Access granted, Officer Huxley.

1054
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:58,420
Accessing Simon Phoenix, Deepfile rehab 65-R.

1055
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,750
Urban Combatkill.

1056
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:02,390
Torture Methodology. Computer Override Authority.

1057
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,260
- There must be a mistake. - Survival Tactics.

1058
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:07,660
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training. Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.

1059
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:10,000
Explosives technician. Violent Behavior.

1060
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,060
- This isn't a rehab program. - No kidding.

1061
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,170
This would create a monster.

1062
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,730
Who develops these programs?

1063
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,570
Cocteau Industries of course.

1064
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,010
But why would the benevolent...

1065
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,170
Dr. Cocteau send such a brute savage into our midst?

1066
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,080
Good question. Let's go ask him.

1067
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,000
No, John Spartan. You do not accuse our savior of being connected with a...

1068
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:32,110
multi-murderdeathkiller like Phoenix.

1069
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,090
It's, rude.

1070
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,760
I'll be subtle.

1071
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:38,780
I'm good at subtle.

1072
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,260
Mellow greetings.

1073
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,090
We are happy to welcome you...

1074
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:48,030
to the Cocteau Behavioral Engineering Complex.

1075
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,200
Be well.

1076
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,430
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

1077
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,830
Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition, detective...

1078
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:02,670
but I do have a entire city-gov to run.

1079
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,380
Well, run this.

1080
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:07,890
You programmed Phoenix's rehab to turn him into a terrorist.

1081
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,550
And I don't think his escape was an accident.

1082
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:11,750
- Very subtle. - Thank you.

1083
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:14,760
Outside the museum, why didn't he blow your brains up?

1084
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:15,890
What did you say?

1085
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,630
I don't remember. Does it matter?

1086
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,970
Yeah, it matters. I saw the security disk.

1087
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:24,470
He had 10 seconds to figure out where to put the hole in your fucking head.

1088
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:30,430
- John Spartan, this display of barbaric behavior was unacceptable even in your time. - Yeah

1089
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,580
But it works.

1090
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:43,490
When a man like Phoenix has a gun near your head, 10 seconds is 9.5 seconds longer than you live.

1091
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,650
Not everyone is as eager as you...

1092
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,620
to resort to violence to solve all the difficulties in life.

1093
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:54,420
Even now, I begin wondering if the chaos in the museum was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence or your own.

1094
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:59,200
Wonder about this, shithead.

1095
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,180
If you think you got this maniac under control, trust me...

1096
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,780
you don't.

1097
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:09,070
- Is there something specific you plan to do with that archaic device? - John Spartan

1098
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,950
No, I didn't think so.

1099
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:18,610
Detective, the only thing I haven't got under control is you.

1100
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,890
But that can be solved.

1101
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,850
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.

1102
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:27,200
Your family's dead, your past is dead.

1103
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:29,670
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

1104
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,990
enjoy your moment...

1105
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:35,540
of prehistoric bravado because after you leave here it will be over.

1106
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,480
Like everything else in your life.

1107
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,350
Officer, return this man to cryo-stasis immediately.

1108
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,190
Be well.

1109
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:46,860
Be fucked.

1110
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,490
You are fined one credit...

1111
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,140
I'll wait here.

1112
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,170
Let's go.

1113
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:03,830
- I don't know. - I do know. Turn that thing on.

1114
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:06,000
I hope you know what you're doing.

1115
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,700
You're asking me to disobey a direct order.

1116
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,680
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

1117
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:16,000
You do what you gotta do, I know what I gotta do. I gotta get that maniac and put him on ice or that's where I'll be.

1118
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:18,990
- Enhance your calm, John Spartan. - Look I've had it with enhancing my calm.

1119
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:23,690
I'm gonna find that psycho Phoenix, enhance his calm. Then I'll turn all my attention to Cocteau.

1120
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,360
You don't have to come with me. I'll do it alone. OK?

1121
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:32,270
Even if Phoenix was programmed to escape, kill and steal...

1122
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,300
why are you going to the wasteland?

1123
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:37,930
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work because Phoenix was in a place...

1124
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:40,440
you can't monitor...

1125
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:43,710
afraid to go and see, don't give a shit about.

1126
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,210
I wanna go down there, I wanna find Phoenix and I wanna put him in a hurt locker.

1127
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,470
So, you wanna come with me? Or you wanna arrest me?

1128
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,120
I'm with you.

1129
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,220
Let's go blow this guy.

1130
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:01,890
Away.

1131
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,900
Blow this guy away.

1132
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:06,060
Whatever.

1133
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,740
She has a way with words.

1134
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:21,820
What's wrong, Huxley?

1135
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,750
It's not very clean.

1136
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,160
A real garden spot.

1137
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,080
All right. Which way?

1138
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,660
Over there.

1139
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,090
Okay, you guys be ready for anything.

1140
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,610
My dog's better than your dog

1141
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:49,010
My dog's better than yours

1142
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:52,280
My dog's better 'cause he gets Kennel-Ration

1143
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:55,490
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, I...

1144
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,950
Sorry.

1145
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,160
Over here.

1146
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,210
What's that emanation?

1147
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,180
Come on guys.

1148
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,170
No. Hey, just relax. All I want is a burger and a beer if you got one.

1149
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,900
How will I pay?

1150
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:46,330
Huxley, it's better to give.

1151
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:55,570
Want a slug?

1152
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,010
No, thank you.

1153
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,080
I think I'll be sick.

1154
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,850
Oh, God.

1155
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,750
It's fantastic. You guys must try one.

1156
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:09,390
Just don't ask where the meat comes from.

1157
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:10,930
Huxley, what does that mean?

1158
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,430
Do you see any cows around here, detective?

1159
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,860
Rat?

1160
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,700
This is a rat burger?

1161
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,440
Not bad.

1162
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,110
It's the best burger I've had in years.

1163
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,390
See you later.

1164
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,410
They don't seem very hostile, John Spartan.

1165
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,920
No, they don't.

1166
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,660
Now that's a thing of beauty.

1167
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,330
Huxley, do you know what this is?

1168
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,330
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

1169
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:32,610
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

1170
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,610
Radial tires and bucket seats.

1171
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,010
I'm impressed.

1172
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,240
I studied.

1173
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,940
So did I. Hand over the glow-rod.

1174
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:44,280
Your friends too. Come on, move.

1175
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:54,960
You got balls, coming down here.

1176
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,690
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

1177
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:00,860
Can you help us or just bully us with your primitive weapons?

1178
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:08,150
Or maybe they're not so primitive.

1179
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,310
So you think you're taking me in?

1180
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:13,720
Guess what?

1181
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,890
Not happening.

1182
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,910
You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass. Yeah. That's right.

1183
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,190
You tell Cocteau, it'll take an army, asshole, to get rid of me.

1184
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:23,390
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

1185
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:27,980
I don't know who the hell you are, let alone want to take you anywhere.

1186
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:31,490
So stay here, be well and Cocteau's an asshole!

1187
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,170
Let's dump them up top. They're only here to spy on us.

1188
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,000
Wait a minute.

1189
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,930
- You're the guy outside Taco Bell. - Yeah.

1190
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,210
What do you want?

1191
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,720
I guess you weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

1192
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:52,410
Greed, deception, abuse of power. That's no plan.

1193
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,750
- That's why everybody is down here? - That's right.

1194
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,230
See...

1195
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,690
According to Cocteau's plan...

1196
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:03,200
I'm an enemy because I like to think.

1197
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,760
I like to read.

1198
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,700
I'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice.

1199
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,460
I'm the kind of guy who likes to sit in a greasy spoon...

1200
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:12,870
and think, "Should I have steak or barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"

1201
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14,030
I want high cholesterol.

1202
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:17,210
I want to eat bacon, butter and cheese.

1203
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,280
I want to smoke a cigar the size of Cincinnati.

1204
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,250
I want to run through the streets naked...

1205
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,970
reading Playboy magazine because I might need to.

1206
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:28,230
I've seen the future. You know what it is?

1207
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:30,290
It's a 47-year-old virgin...

1208
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,190
drinking a banana-broccoli shake and singing "I'm a wiener".

1209
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,820
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.

1210
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,060
What he wants, when he wants, how he wants.

1211
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:40,700
Your other choice: come down here.

1212
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:42,300
Maybe starve to death.

1213
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:46,240
Why don't you take charge and lead these people out of here?

1214
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,670
I'm no leader.

1215
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,710
I do what I have to do.

1216
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:50,510
Sometimes people come with me.

1217
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:56,150
All I wanna do is bury Cocteau up to his neck and let him think happy happy thoughts forever.

1218
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,450
Then I got bad news.

1219
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,320
I think he wants to kill you.

1220
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,790
All right gentlemen, let's review.

1221
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:09,330
The year is 2032.

1222
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:13,470
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

1223
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:18,630
And I'm sorry to say that the world has become a pussy-whipped...

1224
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:23,980
Brady Bunch version of itself run by a bunch of robed sissies.

1225
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,920
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

1226
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:31,450
is to kill a man named Friendly, who put it all together.

1227
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,890
But there's an extra added bonus.

1228
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:37,820
We get to kill...

1229
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,330
the man who put most of us in the freezer.

1230
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,660
You mean...

1231
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:43,490
we get to kill John Spartan?

1232
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,830
Exactly.

1233
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,610
I want you to loot, pillage, plunder, I want you to steal.

1234
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:53,200
I want you do all the wonderful things that we used to do before any of this happened.

1235
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,970
This world will be ours!

1236
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:58,050
Let's bring back the good old days!

1237
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,250
- Are you with me? - Yeah.

1238
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,310
Let's do it!

1239
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:09,940
It is a curious conclusion which you have deduced, John Spartan.

1240
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:12,960
But I can find no fault in your logic.

1241
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:17,730
Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send into these savage regions.

1242
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,870
I'm impressed, John Spartan.

1243
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:22,940
They thawed him out just to kill me?

1244
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:27,000
- I'm flattered. - Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

1245
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:29,240
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

1246
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:31,510
- That's why you're down here? - Yeah.

1247
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:37,720
I must have done something right in the previous life.

1248
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:40,150
Can't imagine what that could have been.

1249
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,160
Two for the price of one.

1250
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:46,360
Let's take them.

1251
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,370
Stay down!

1252
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,400
I'll be goddamned. Like a New York cockroach.

1253
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,760
Everything's going wrong.

1254
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,890
There's an elevator shaft at the top.

1255
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:22,650
Does that mean we're going up?

1256
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,690
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.

1257
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,380
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

1258
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:04,960
Now what?

1259
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:06,660
Buckle up.

1260
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,150
There he is! He is in my car!

1261
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:39,600
I'll be goddamned.

1262
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,070
What's happening to cops today?

1263
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:50,770
Don't you know you are endangering civilians?

1264
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,300
Auto-inflate!

1265
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,700
Auto-inflate.

1266
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,330
That was lovely.

1267
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,970
Huxley, drive!

1268
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:23,110
Okay, I've read all about this.

1269
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,750
What do I do now? Push this pedal?

1270
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,750
Okay, I got it.

1271
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:42,730
Punch it! Huxley!

1272
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:43,990
Excuse me?

1273
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,590
Push the pedal as hard as you can!

1274
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:59,380
No free rides!

1275
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,690
Emergency, doors open.

1276
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:07,820
Doors opening.

1277
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:10,820
Say hello to my friend.

1278
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,470
Doors close!

1279
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,800
Malfunction.

1280
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,150
Computer, auto-drive.

1281
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,650
Auto-drive engaged.

1282
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,240
Going to cut your hair!

1283
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,610
Remember the 40 bus passengers...

1284
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:43,420
you blew up trying to get me?

1285
01:33:44,630 --> 01:33:46,820
They were already dead.

1286
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,190
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!

1287
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,010
I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

1288
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,440
You're dead.

1289
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,670
Speak for yourself.

1290
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,460
Self-drive!

1291
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:16,530
Unable to execute.

1292
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:18,150
- Self-drive! Now! - Malfunction.

1293
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,160
Unable to execute.

1294
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,520
Emergency!

1295
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,690
Brake!

1296
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:27,090
Self-drive engaged.

1297
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:31,400
Brake! Brake!

1298
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,310
Brake now, you, Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

1299
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:12,650
John Spartan, are you in there?

1300
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,280
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

1301
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,520
I thought your life force had been prematurely terminated!

1302
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,930
I thought I was history too.

1303
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:33,870
What the hell happened? All of a sudden, this car turned into cannoli.

1304
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:36,900
It's the securefoam. It saved your life.

1305
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:39,470
Look at you, you're in shambles.

1306
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:43,110
Don't wrong. I can fix it later. All I need is a needle and thread.

1307
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:45,610
I really said that, did I? Damn.

1308
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,950
John Spartan, you caveman, you're under arrest!

1309
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,730
Return to the cryo-prison. Immediately!

1310
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:03,700
I heard all that. We'll talk later, Chief.

1311
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:08,230
Right now, I need something. A shotgun, a flare gun.

1312
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:12,370
Shit!

1313
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,030
Defensive red alert!

1314
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,150
Stun batons on.

1315
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,970
Relax.

1316
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,410
Look at you, you got bump your noggin...

1317
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,140
and think you're Pancho Villa?

1318
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:26,260
Who?

1319
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,550
Never mind.

1320
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,090
Time to take a stand.

1321
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:33,160
Good. While you're doing it, loan me a gun. Two guns.

1322
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:37,100
You'd use these weapons against men and women who uphold the law?

1323
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,770
We use these weapons to shop for groceries, dick.

1324
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,740
You can't leave.

1325
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:48,640
You're under arrest. This very concept negates the possibility of your leaving.

1326
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,750
Skip it, Chief.

1327
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,750
Lieutenant Huxley!

1328
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:53,970
Chief...

1329
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:57,590
you can take this job and you can shovel it.

1330
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,550
Take this job...

1331
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:03,220
and shovel it.

1332
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,560
Close enough.

1333
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:17,040
I hadn't counted on this but I must say, you worked out beautifully.

1334
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:18,770
People are terrified of you.

1335
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:22,170
What's new? People have always been terrified of me.

1336
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,640
But this time they're really intimidated.

1337
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,780
Now...

1338
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:33,550
I'll have carte blanche to create the perfect society.

1339
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:35,890
My society.

1340
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:39,790
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

1341
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,700
with the purity of an ant colony.

1342
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:46,900
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

1343
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:49,500
Look, you can't take away people's right to be assholes.

1344
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,070
That's what you remind me of...

1345
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:55,640
an evil Mr. Rogers.

1346
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,570
Will you please kill him?

1347
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,080
He's pissing me off.

1348
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,120
Put another log on the fire!

1349
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,820
I'll love running this place!

1350
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:24,700
Well, now...

1351
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,170
what shall I do with you?

1352
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:31,680
I am an excellent associate, sir.

1353
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,840
I'd be delighted to continue my services with your administration.

1354
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:38,280
That's the man we'd use...

1355
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,360
Excuse me, the police are here.

1356
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:43,660
Oh, man!

1357
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:11,150
What the hell are you doing?!

1358
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,610
I'm impressed.

1359
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:47,020
That man has died by my hands.

1360
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,750
It was him or us.

1361
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:51,880
There is that.

1362
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:54,360
Where'd you learn to kick like that?

1363
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,730
Jackie Chan movies.

1364
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,810
Looks like the Cocteau plan went up in smoke.

1365
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,810
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

1366
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:17,210
John Spartan, civilization as we know it will come to an end.

1367
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:18,810
What will we do?

1368
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,360
I don't know. But trust me, this is better for you.

1369
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:23,220
What's that?

1370
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:29,460
This is bad.

1371
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:30,890
This is very bad.

1372
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:34,900
He's accessed the cryo-prison and is about to defrost multi-lifers.

1373
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:36,840
Most of them don't like you.

1374
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:40,300
Most of these guys don't like their mothers. They're bad boys.

1375
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,600
How many are they?

1376
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:45,980
Eighty.

1377
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,710
All without rehab.

1378
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:49,850
They'll be re-animated within the hour.

1379
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:51,680
We must stop this.

1380
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:57,620
I'm not at all pleased about having caused the fatality of a convict.

1381
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:02,460
I now understand that under certain circumstances violence is necessary.

1382
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:03,930
Good.

1383
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:10,800
I hope you understand this.

1384
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,020
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

1385
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,950
Okay, who do we have left that's good?

1386
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,250
Let's see...

1387
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:27,820
Foulks, Patrick.

1388
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:30,620
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

1389
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,560
How long before the rest are done?

1390
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,360
They're in the final stages of reanimation.

1391
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:37,200
Great. Absolutely great.

1392
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:40,140
Gentlemen!

1393
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,830
Thank you very much, but your services are no longer required.

1394
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,040
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

1395
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,330
Attention.

1396
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,870
Attention.

1397
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,740
Cryo-prisoner defrosting re-animation sequence...

1398
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:20,780
now entering final stage.

1399
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:25,110
Count down to reanimation of prisoner batches...

1400
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:28,410
290, 310, 480...

1401
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:31,050
570.

1402
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:33,180
10 minutes.

1403
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:37,190
- That's it. The very last one. - Excellent.

1404
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:40,360
Accessed.

1405
01:42:41,670 --> 01:42:43,430
What the hell is that?

1406
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,130
Didn't expect that, did you?!

1407
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:23,240
Where're you going?

1408
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,630
I wish you the best of luck.

1409
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:27,770
Stupid.

1410
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:37,850
How's it hanging?

1411
01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:41,920
I'm sure you're familiar with the long arm of the law.

1412
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:50,090
Why don't you struggle a little bit? Make me work for it!

1413
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:52,060
What do you say? How about...

1414
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:55,800
a little target practice. What do you say?

1415
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:05,110
Did that hurt your head?

1416
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,530
Shit! Goddamn!

1417
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:35,370
Fuck!

1418
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,130
That's it!

1419
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,860
You won't get out of this one!

1420
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:57,030
I'll drop you in that vat of defrost...

1421
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:59,730
and fry you like a chicken...

1422
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:04,030
or with my little pinky, drop your monkey ass...

1423
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,670
I'll be damned.

1424
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:50,780
Shit! Goddamn!

1425
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:51,910
What am I doing wrong?

1426
01:45:52,290 --> 01:45:54,190
Cryo-prisoner re-animation...

1427
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,760
sequence now entering final stage.

1428
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:07,000
Is it cold in here, or is it just me?

1429
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:09,800
Good memory.

1430
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:17,240
Come here!

1431
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:19,010
Shit!

1432
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,360
I hate cops!

1433
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:38,030
Look into my eyes. I'll see you in hell.

1434
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,440
Not.

1435
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:25,810
This is the best day of my life.

1436
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:57,040
Heads up!

1437
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:51,730
Did you apprehend the villain responsible for murdering of Dr. Raymond Cocteau?

1438
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,800
I wouldn't exactly say apprehend.

1439
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:55,460
But he's a history.

1440
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,330
And the cryo-prison...

1441
01:48:57,470 --> 01:48:58,630
That is history too.

1442
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,470
What'll we do?

1443
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:05,380
How will we live?

1444
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:09,480
We'll go out drinking, get shit-faced and paint the town.

1445
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,750
Graffiti slogans, it'll be a blast.

1446
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:13,750
I'm gonna tell you what you gonna do.

1447
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,430
Why don't you get a little dirty...

1448
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:17,860
you, a lot clean.

1449
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,990
And somewhere in the middle...

1450
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,820
You'll figure it out.

1451
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,190
Fucking-A.

1452
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,670
Well put.

1453
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:32,370
Greetings and salutations.

1454
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:34,940
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

1455
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:38,510
it would be a pleasure to assist you creating a more humane...

1456
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:41,220
Let's talk about the hair, okay?

1457
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:45,490
Pick a color. And lose the kimono. You look like a couch.

1458
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,860
Thanks for rendering me unconscious.

1459
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:57,960
Huxley, I did it for your own good.

1460
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:00,160
- We're supposed to be a team. - We are.

1461
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,970
Oh, my.

1462
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:14,210
Are all fluid transfer activities like this?

1463
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:16,750
- Better. - Better?

1464
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:18,480
Oh, my.

1465
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:23,860
I think I'll like the future.

1466
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:26,430
Now that you've demolished everything.

1467
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,190
But there's one thing I want to know.

1468
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,790
How did damn there sea shell you work?
