1
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:19,019
Work harder! Keep on!

2
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,707
Cut!

3
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,378
Wake up! Even extras are actors.

4
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,797
We're not making a ghost film now.

5
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,675
Though you guys
play the roles of pedestrians,

6
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,720
but your roles still have life an soul.

7
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:39,683
Especially we've chance to act with
the Kungfu actress Queen Cuckoo Tu...

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,768
so we should grasp this chance.

9
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,770
Act smartly, OK?

10
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,774
Action!

11
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,197
Cut!

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,201
- Who are you?
- I'm an actor.

13
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,660
Aunt Ha!

14
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,745
Yes.

15
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,913
- Who is this guy?
- An extra.

16
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,039
I'm an actor.

17
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,081
Are you mistaken?

18
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,917
How can you let him touch my machine?

19
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,919
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
I just went to toilet.

20
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,962
so I asked him to do the rehearsal.

21
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,716
Find someone who knows how to act,
we need one urgently.

22
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,426
- Let me do it.
- You?

23
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,346
Show me the expression of "nervous".

24
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,182
There're several kinds
of nervous expression.

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,351
The one on the face of a husband
whose wife is delivering a baby.

26
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,814
The baby is given birth.
But the wife is dead.

27
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,943
The baby calls him dad, he's a genius.

28
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,654
His dick is on his head, he's abnormal.

29
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,032
He wins Mark Six...first prize!

30
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,159
His son is dead...

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,453
His wife comes back to life.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,163
His wife comes back to life.

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,582
No more response,
if one is struck too hard emotionally...

34
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,628
he will enter a state of mental coma,
he'll show no response.

35
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,713
Is there another guy?

36
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,800
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

37
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,093
I don't know what you were doing.

38
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,470
Was there anything wrong
with my expression?

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,389
I've said I didn't know
what you were doing.

40
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,226
Aunt Ha, none of your extras
is smart enough.

41
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,686
All these extras are above standard.

42
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,730
Sunny, is it done?

43
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,149
Everyone is waiting.

44
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,485
OK...Director, it'll soon be done...

45
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,863
- You, go and change your clothes.
- Thanks.

46
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,240
- Stand in this position.
- Got it.

47
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,951
- Lighting.
- Lighting is ready.

48
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,578
- Settings.
- Settings ready.

49
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,121
Actors.

50
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,206
Stand-by.

51
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,416
Sorry, Director.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,668
According to the character of my role.

53
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,005
I want to play my role
with a bit naughtiness...

54
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,132
But contradiction. Will this be better?

55
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,594
OK, Speed.

56
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,262
Speed.

57
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,390
- Scene 3. Shot 4, take 1.
- Action!

58
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,507
Cut!

59
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,175
What is it?

60
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,885
What's wrong with the guy behind.

61
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,262
He's supposed to be dead.

62
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,723
- What are you doing? Aunt Ha!
- What is it? Brother Sunny?

63
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,267
What is your extra up to?

64
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,061
How come you are still alive?

65
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,982
As I said I'd play my role
with a bit naughtiness.

66
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,694
So subconsciously
I don't want to die yet.

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,906
You must pretend to be dead.

68
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,825
Actually, I was dying.

69
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,203
If you give me a bit more time,
I'll die eventually.

70
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,790
Do you know how many frames of film
are there in one second?

71
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,500
24 frames, Sister Cuckoo.

72
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,003
Do you know
how long is the shot just then?

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,713
I guess it about one minute.

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,257
Do you know as you didn't want to die...

75
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,343
that you've wasted how many seconds,
how many frames and how much money

76
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,221
and how much time
and effort of everyone here?

77
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,140
Are you fooling around here?

78
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,352
I'm begging you, you'd better
find a professional extra for this role.

79
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,688
Get someone smarter and shoot again!

80
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,523
You'd better be smart!

81
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,400
Go home and think about
when exactly you want to die.

82
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,401
OK, Brother Sunny.

83
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,362
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

84
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,449
Don't ask me again, I really don't know
what you were doing.

85
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,075
- Then I...
- Get lost.

86
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,578
You remind me I must go to a meeting
of Neighbour Welfare Association.

87
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,495
I'll be right back.

88
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,080
You don't have to come back.

89
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,459
I'm begging you, stop making trouble.

90
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,839
Let the director watch your performance?

91
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,800
Director, what kind of performance?

92
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,094
You are shot to dead, ready.

93
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,221
Action!

94
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,518
Was it OK, Director?

95
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,728
This is it, go and change your clothes.

96
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,355
- Go ahead.
- Thanks...

97
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,025
Where did you learn acting, man?

98
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,694
- I've never learnt it.
- You're a real genius.

99
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,614
You can make it if you work hard.

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,035
Why are you still standing here?
Fuck off!

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,833
What are you doing here?

102
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,335
Unit manager,
I want to get a lunch box only.

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,670
It's not yet lunch time.

104
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,673
- As I'm leaving now, so I...
- Then you just go!

105
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,968
Do you know why it's not yet lunch time?

106
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,680
Just because of you, bastard,
you didn't want to die!

107
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,390
And now everyone is working
and starving.

108
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,100
I haven't eaten as well!

109
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,564
Do you want to have lunch?
Share your lunch with that puppy!

110
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:28,907
Shit, you're a dump of shit.
Your life is cheaper than ants.

111
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,911
I ride a Mercedes,
you pick your nostril.

112
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,665
You want to have lunch?
You better eat shit!

113
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:52,514
Why did you just come back now?

114
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,729
- You guys have lunch already?
- Shut up, get me a ping pong racket.

115
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,439
OK!

116
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,486
Where's the ping pong ball?
Get me one now.

117
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,071
Quick.

118
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,449
- Right away.
- Hurry.

119
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,203
This is Neighbour Welfare Association.

120
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,289
You mustn't be late,
many people are waiting for you.

121
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,790
Hello, Aunt Ha?

122
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,918
Nothing, I want to check the time
for tomorrow notice.

123
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,002
You haven't for tomorrow.

124
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:22,878
What about the day after tomorrow?

125
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,505
Nothing for the day after tomorrow
and so on.

126
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,383
Aunt Ha, where are you?

127
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,885
None of your business, what do you want?

128
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,472
I check with you again, is there notice
for role without dialogue?

129
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,140
No.

130
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,769
- Any role that can't be seen clearly?
- No.

131
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,855
Any role that can't he seen completely?

132
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,233
I can't see you now. Don't trouble me.

133
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,312
- Aunt Ha, where are you?
- Go to hell!

134
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,168
Dear fellows.

135
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,256
The play "Thunder Storm" is adapted from
a well-known Chinese classic literature.

136
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,174
You guys all know it well.

137
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:18,011
Tomorrow, I'll be leading actor,
you guys want to see it, right?

138
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,389
So, I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

139
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,767
Kelly, is there anything to do
after dinner tomorrow?

140
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,269
Taking a dump.

141
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,106
Come and watch Uncle San's play
after taking a dump, it'll be fun.

142
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,400
Remember to bring your dad and mom too.

143
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:35,404
If they don't come, you can cry,
spit around.

144
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,656
Do whatever you can until they come,
then you'll be a good girl.

145
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,533
I pamper you, Kelly.

146
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,955
Kelly, if I don't see you tomorrow.

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,541
You'll result like this doll.

148
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,753
You get that?

149
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,719
Uncle Chi, the play "Thunder Storm"
will be on show tomorrow night.

150
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,095
Have you studied the script well?

151
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,931
Yes, don't worry.
I can even compose a song.

152
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,309
Old Master sings
whenever he sees the maid.

153
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:10,814
You're beautiful...

154
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,317
Uncle Chi, I'm the one
who sing the theme song.

155
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,278
And the role of "Old Master"
you play is a Chinese as well.

156
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,989
When the maid sees the Old Master,
she will sing...

157
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:24,661
You're so handsome, you're so smart...

158
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:30,209
- Thank you much, please to...
- Uncle Chi, please don't...

159
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,336
- I accept you...
- Are you OK?

160
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,254
Think positive, Uncle Chi.

161
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,840
Someone helps me, come on.

162
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,051
Master Hung, morning.

163
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,677
My play "Thunder Storm"
will soon be showing.

164
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,846
Shall we make another rehearsal?

165
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,266
Do I need to rehearsal? "Thunder Storm"
is about righteous, I knew it.

166
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,061
We're triad society member,
we only talk about two things.

167
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,523
First, about righteous,
second, about money.

168
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,983
I'll talk about righteous first.

169
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,737
"Righteous" is good, but we mustn't
ignore the love line of the story.

170
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:03,075
Because the role you play
will finally be struck to death.

171
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,952
Talking about "struck" (chopping),
let me tell you...

172
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,705
There are two kinds of "struck"
(chopping) in our world.

173
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:14,086
First, it is "dragging".
Second is "stabbing".

174
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:21,218
Look, this scar was dragged by knife.

175
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,262
While "stabbing" is like this.

176
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,393
This scoundrel is new comer, sorry,
he shows no expression.

177
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,603
"Stabbing" is like this.

178
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,191
Be serious,
let us know if you feel the pain, OK?

179
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,487
Your acting is lousy.

180
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,656
Brother Sau, teaching him for me.

181
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,075
Talking about "pain"...

182
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,788
according to Stanisslavski,
master of acting from Russia.

183
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:54,293
Pain is transmitted from your body to
the inside, and outside again.

184
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,461
Let try one more time.

185
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,384
Look, it's much better this time.

186
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,262
Isn't it? He acts much better now.

187
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,972
Let's try one more time.

188
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,478
Right, a little bit more, more,
being stabbed.

189
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,360
Maybe I can help you this way.

190
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,668
This is working, tears come out now.

191
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,549
Look clearly, remember this expression,
remember this feeling.

192
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,136
Do remember this, get it?

193
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,554
Let's go.

194
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,931
What about own "Thunder Storm" tomorrow.

195
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,307
No rehearsal needed for "Thunder Storm".

196
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,019
We will come for sure,
promise is a promise!

197
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,065
I'll bring hundreds of people
to watch your play as well.

198
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,692
- It's a deal.
- Just don't worry.

199
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,985
Faster.

200
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,283
Get into position.

201
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,702
Granny, you stepped on someone.

202
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,789
I didn't step on anyone.

203
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:17,125
You just couldn't feel when you
stepped on him, look at his foot.

204
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,670
Yes, he's sweating as well.

205
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,506
Give me some money and I'll
send him to the hospital.

206
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,049
I have no money.

207
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,176
Look at him, he's dying.

208
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,053
I only have $100 left.

209
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,513
Give me, that $100.

210
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,349
Let's move!

211
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,190
Granny, you've dropped some money.

212
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,067
Really good luck.

213
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,611
Sir...

214
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,864
- Are you free tomorrow?
- What is it?

215
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,199
"Thunder Storm" is on show
at Neighbour Theatre.

216
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,910
"Thunder Storm"? Good!

217
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,698
Miss, what's your name?

218
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:12,741
Piu, and you?

219
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,494
This is your name, really?

220
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,746
Whatever I told you,
just call me Piu, idiot?

221
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,581
You're really a student?

222
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,252
Sure I am, I'm still a virgin,
isn't that great?

223
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:24,837
It's your luck, Uncle.

224
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,380
Let's play 'Chai Fist'?

225
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,631
I don't know how to play it.

226
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,008
You don't know 'Chai Fist'?
Have you been educated?

227
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,218
Fanny, come here.

228
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:36,014
Your belly is really big!
Mind you can't get into the coffin.

229
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,891
'Chai Fist', Bingo!

230
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,435
Come on, relax, have some fun.

231
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,145
Cheer up, why did draw your face?
Your parents are dead or something?

232
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,814
Chai Fist', Bingo!

233
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,567
Triangle, rectangle, four!

234
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,026
Good, I'll drink!

235
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,584
Tonight is College Girls'
First Love Evening.

236
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,962
So please mind your words,
do behave like a student girl.

237
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,840
If clients complain about you again,
then I can't help you anymore.

238
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,885
What College Girl? Just a damned trick.

239
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,053
If I can be a college girl,
I won't be working here.

240
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,471
You believe you did nothing wrong?

241
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,891
Mamasan, the man at Table 7
is really ugly.

242
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,726
I can't stand it and
I am not doing business with him.

243
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,270
Do you all want to
be selecting on clients?

244
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,688
No...

245
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,691
You're too much.

246
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,736
You are not professional,
you can concentrate on one single.

247
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,154
One single spot?

248
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,990
If that man is ugly,
you needn't look at him.

249
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,784
If his ears are pretty,
just stare at his ears.

250
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:41,997
If his mouth is ugly but the teeth
are nice, just look at his teeth.

251
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,416
So you new comer are really ignorant.

252
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,171
Let me deal with him.
Come on, watch what I'll do.

253
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,714
Be smart.

254
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,383
Hi!

255
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,389
You're pretty.

256
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,976
What's your name, Boss?

257
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,978
My name is Pierre.

258
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,856
It's a French name.

259
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,528
Are everyone says I look like
a Frenchman, so I get a French name.

260
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:18,492
If you can't pronounce that well,
just call me Pi or Erre.

261
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:23,914
What's on?

262
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,793
You used to be proud,
now you get a lesson.

263
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,296
You can't blame me, he's a real rarity.

264
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,423
Have you seen anyone
put a cockroach on his head?

265
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,550
What's the problem?

266
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,511
Look at LuLu,
she's playing with that cockroach now.

267
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,433
I admit failure.

268
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,144
OK, from now on,
you won't have clients to sit at.

269
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,314
You'll be bored to death.

270
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,316
You're all like this.

271
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,443
Connie, come and teach her for me.

272
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,656
You're not amateur, you should know
you must act in front of clients.

273
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,701
But your problem is: you acting stinks.

274
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,035
I can do nothing about it.

275
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,372
I hear someone teaches acting for free.

276
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,790
I'll take you to see him.

277
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,876
Teaches acting?

278
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,467
- Hey, men.
- Yes!

279
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,636
Hurry up, start working.

280
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,183
You again?

281
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,058
Morning, Brother Sunny.

282
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,894
Aunt Ha!

283
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,312
I'm looking for him too.

284
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,564
I haven't given you a notice,
what brings you here?

285
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,734
Remember last time that you asked me
to think about the ways to die.

286
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:37,112
I've thought over and
I have some new ideas now,

287
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,449
and I believe my performance
will make you satisfied.

288
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,869
I would have killed you in the past.

289
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,371
Talking about knife,
it's different from a gun.

290
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,333
The position of the wound
is usually under the armpit, here.

291
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,629
The wound is a bit bigger,
and the face will twist more.

292
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,715
If you're betrayed by your own friends,
you will even...

293
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,719
I didn't expect...it's you...

294
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,262
Get lost!

295
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,097
Brother Sunny, I...

296
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:07,851
I just want to act,
give me a chance please.

297
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,977
Do you love standing here?

298
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,146
OK, stand here, I won't pay you a dime.

299
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,233
I'll act even if you don't pay me,
I only want a lunch box.

300
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,568
But lunch box costs money too, beat it!

301
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,861
Sunny.

302
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:19,988
What is it, Martial Art Director?

303
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,951
It's bad to use this mannequin
to disguise as a dead man.

304
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,869
Figure it out, we're in a hurry!

305
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,579
Yes, OK...got it.

306
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,252
Thank you, Brother Sunny.

307
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,378
Only a lunch box.

308
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,547
No problem,
should I put some make up on?

309
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:37,673
Put it on now.

310
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,261
Director, the actors are ready.

311
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,554
Actors are all ready.

312
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,013
Action!

313
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,056
Cockroach...

314
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,349
Let's help sister Cuckoo.

315
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,852
Cockroach!

316
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,193
Go to hell!

317
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,819
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid.

318
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,197
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid,
it's OK now.

319
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,364
Director, can we cut now?

320
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,782
It's still running?

321
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,367
Cut!

322
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,161
- OK.
- Are you OK?

323
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,997
Must you do all these
to kill a cockroach!

324
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:53,832
Let's see if he's alright?

325
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,668
I'm fine, Sister Cuckoo,
thanks for your concerns.

326
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,337
Why don't you move at all?

327
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:03,967
I didn't move
since Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

328
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,844
So I mustn't move.

329
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:10,516
Do you hear that...

330
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,061
He keeps on acting since the Director
hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

331
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:17,356
This is what I always tell you:
professionalism.

332
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,068
What's your name?

333
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,278
I'm called Wan Tin Sau.

334
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,240
- Yee, give him a cup of coffee.
- Yes.

335
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,991
- Get his phone number for me.
- Yes.

336
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:31,078
You...work in my team from now on.

337
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,121
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

338
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,541
- Is this shot OK?
- Yes.

339
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,417
Weapon comes.

340
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,670
- Sunny.
- Yes.

341
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,798
I am telling you,
even extras are important.

342
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,802
The one who played the father,
we mustn't use him again.

343
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,886
Got it, Sister Cuckoo.

344
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,557
Sister Cuckoo,
I am the one who played the Father.

345
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,687
In fact, it is like this...

346
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,816
Fine...

347
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,901
Let me clean it for you,
towel, get the towel.

348
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,614
- Sister Cuckoo!
- Watch out!

349
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,458
Sister Cuckoo, are you alright?

350
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:19,835
Don't touch.

351
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,047
Don't touch!

352
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,431
Very pretty.

353
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,644
Sister Cuckoo!

354
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,628
Security guard, is there someone here
who teaches acting?

355
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:48,298
I've been in the field of art for ages.

356
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,010
Whether it's movie or TV,
I'm experienced.

357
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,347
I was the creative director
in Amusement Park Theatre.

358
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:58,600
So I can sing and dance.

359
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:00,769
You mean you are the instructor here?

360
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:04,773
Well, many people here
love theatre and play.

361
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,401
They love studying plays with me.

362
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,319
Those people introduce us here indeed.

363
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,821
OK, this way please.

364
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,865
It's you?

365
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,993
Didn't you play in that film...that...

366
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,035
The stupid man standing behind, falls
after stepping on a banana peel?

367
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,582
You noticed my performance too?

368
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:26,211
You idiot! Only an idiot will fall
after stepping on a banana peel.

369
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,548
- Why don't you go dying?
- Thanks.

370
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,968
- Are you really that stupid?
- You're flattering me.

371
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,721
You damned extra, you are...

372
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:39,600
In fact, I am an actor. That way please.

373
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,018
Damned extra.

374
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,647
What can I do for you?

375
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:48,108
Frankly,
we're hostesses of a night club.

376
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:49,443
I can tell.

377
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,613
We're holding "College Girls'
First Love Evening" right now.

378
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,700
These girls dare to say they don't
have the feeling of first love at all.

379
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,536
How can you work like this?

380
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:03,040
First love was shown at the stage
when we where babies.

381
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:08,212
Say, when a baby sees a comforter,
he wants to suck it.

382
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,923
This is a kind of love.

383
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,635
Why did you suck a comforter?
You damned extra.

384
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,221
In fact, I am an actor.

385
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,098
Well, so why did you talk about
sucking a comforter?

386
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,602
I'm going to explain everything to you.

387
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:25,729
OK, let's explain it.

388
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:30,317
First, you must dress up
like a college girls,

389
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,778
about dialogue, at some vital points...

390
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:36,448
such as: I love you, I hate you, etc.

391
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:42,496
It'll be more impressive
if you have some tears in your eyes.

392
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,206
Just like this.

393
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,881
Do you see? That teardrop...

394
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,385
Good, the teardrop is inside the eyes.

395
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,347
Where is the teardrop? You damned extra.

396
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,600
In fact, I am an actor.

397
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,524
You might need something to help you
since you've no experience,

398
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:13,986
and the simplest way is to eat Wasabi.

399
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,738
Wasabi? What are you talking about?

400
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,658
Must we be fooled by this damned extra?

401
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,411
Miss, if you must call me an extra,

402
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,581
you don't need to add 'damned'
in front of it.

403
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:31,545
In fact, being club girls...

404
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,131
If you can show some respect
to the others, then...

405
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,258
- What are you calling us?
- Excuse me.

406
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,219
Forget it, we are club girls indeed.

407
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,804
I just don't like him
calling me that way.

408
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,892
She's always like this, never mind her.

409
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:51,982
It's OK...

410
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,487
I've asked you not to stir up trouble!

411
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,824
It's OK...

412
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,082
It's OK...

413
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,920
Why must you still behave like this?
Don't panic, it's alright.

414
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,174
- Don't panic, it's alright.
- Club girls?

415
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,719
It's alright...Don't panic,
take it easy, it's alright.

416
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,930
How could I know he's so amusing?

417
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,890
I brought you there as I thought
he charged for nothing.

418
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,808
If you hadn't block my way, I'd have...

419
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,978
Please, beware what you say
to the clients.

420
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:31,730
- Go out...
- I'm sorry.

421
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,774
What's going on?
This is a big night club.

422
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,317
Get lost, I'm sorry.

423
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,486
- Are there other hostesses?
- Yes, they're coming soon.

424
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:38,737
Connie, come here.

425
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:39,696
What is it, Mama Debra?

426
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,448
Master Lung is here and he's drunk.

427
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:44,034
He thought he's being dumped
and he wants his first lover back.

428
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,036
All the girls here are college girls,
they'll suit him.

429
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,331
Look,
he has scanned almost all my girls.

430
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,333
But none of them suits his taste,
he's nuts.

431
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,546
Look at his money, it's piled up.

432
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,339
- Have you gone inside?
- Not yet.

433
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:00,217
Wait here for a while.
Go and send some more girls here.

434
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,679
I have so much money.

435
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:06,181
Come and get it if you can.

436
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,935
I want my first lover.

437
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,397
First lover!

438
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,651
You wanna try?

439
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,488
I'll give it a shot, sometimes it's hard
to tell the taste of a rich man.

440
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,033
Get lost.

441
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,874
Hurry up, be smart.

442
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,962
Master Lung, here come the beauties.
Say Hi to Master Lung.

443
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,590
Boss.

444
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:43,594
Get lost!

445
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,806
- Master Lung, don't get mad.
- Go away!

446
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,142
None of them is pretty!

447
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:54,354
They are not sincere,
I want my first lover!

448
00:30:54,563 --> 00:31:01,737
First lover...

449
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,411
They're all here for money!

450
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,960
I am sincere.

451
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,091
I really love you.

452
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:29,890
Mary, I'll give you anything you want.

453
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,560
I can give you
all the money on the table...

454
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:40,234
as long as you don't leave me, Mary.

455
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,054
- What is it?
- Are you alright?

456
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,890
I've hit you hard, sorry.

457
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,643
If that table wasn't there
and I could kick you,

458
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,186
I wouldn't have been defeated by you.

459
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,314
I'm not here to fight with you,
I'm here to learn acting from you.

460
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,732
Go away.

461
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,073
To some honest friends
who have the same interest as I do.

462
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,743
I'll be more than willing to teach them.
Just a second.

463
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:48,218
I'm coming, 1, 2, 2 and a half, 3.

464
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:13,327
Must it take you so long for make up?
You damned...

465
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:14,495
Don't again!

466
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:17,581
- Your tie is high-classed.
- Thanks.

467
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,417
Since I've taken your money,
I should act accordingly.

468
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,669
- Where's the ping pong racket?
- Under the table.

469
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:24,671
There're many people here,
let's go over there.

470
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,634
I'm Wan Tin Sau, and you?

471
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:30,761
Lau Piu Piu.

472
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,304
What do you want to learn?

473
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,264
How to pamper
those bastards in the night club.

474
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:39,102
The first love feeling of college girls
must be built from the base.

475
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,939
You can take me as your client,
and greet me first.

476
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,357
Boss, want some fist games?

477
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,817
Don't call me "Boss",
you're college girl now.

478
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,569
You can say Good Morning,

479
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,404
or Morning, Sir.

480
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,114
Good morning, Sir.

481
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,784
Try to lower your head a little bit,
pretend to be shy.

482
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,746
Let your client touches your chin
and raise your head and then say.

483
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,581
Morning, Sir.

484
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:01,458
Your regards are bad, again.

485
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,961
Give me glistened regards.

486
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:05,712
Morning, Sir.

487
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:10,884
Too glistened now, I'll faint, again.
Take it easy.

488
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:15,597
Morning, Sir.

489
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:18,308
These are eyes of dead body,
you'll scare others to death.

490
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:23,605
Again. Be natural.

491
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,024
Morning, Sir.

492
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:36,034
Good!

493
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:40,122
Now let's discuss about your action,
say, hugging.

494
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,499
Hug me with your way.

495
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,049
What for?

496
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:52,885
What for?

497
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,679
You needn't lock others
with your thigh every time.

498
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,640
- Sorry, my job requires this.
- You must stop doing that.

499
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:04,188
Being a college girl,
you needn't always take initiation.

500
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:09,401
You can act shyly
so that men will hug you.

501
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,195
What do you mean by shy?

502
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:14,615
Like this.

503
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,409
- Like biting a quail?
- Act on.

504
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,706
Right, when men see you biting a quail,

505
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,875
they'll naturally hold and hug you.

506
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,880
Now you can put your head
on their shoulders.

507
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,808
What for?

508
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,603
Excuse me, my job requires this.

509
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,522
You must stop doing that!

510
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,524
Superficially it's all.

511
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,194
If we go further, I must then ask you
about your first love.

512
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,738
I never have first love.

513
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,782
Everyone has first love.

514
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,242
I said I never have one.

515
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:02,329
You must have some unforgettable memory.

516
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:03,664
No.

517
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,510
Or you must have heard someone
say something you can never forget.

518
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,054
Never!

519
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,139
I hope I can be with you forever.

520
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,726
Promise me, let me take care of you
for the rest of your life.

521
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,748
Then you must have
unforgettable experience.

522
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,709
Never!

523
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:55,591
Being club girl? Didn't say
you'll take care of me?

524
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,760
How come I have money
if you don't work as club girl?

525
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,054
How can I take care of you
if I have no money?

526
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:07,060
Now, imagine
I'm your first boyfriend lover.

527
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:24,328
Sau, on the night of your play,
I was engaged in a transaction.

528
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,164
So I was too busy to come, sorry.

529
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,458
- Was there good response?
- Sure.

530
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,753
It's good then.
I will surely come next time.

531
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:39,718
Someone're shooing kids karaoke,
you aren't one of them?

532
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,012
I've things to see you, excuse me.

533
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:45,432
Take me new boy
to collect protection money for me.

534
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,685
Help me improve his appearance...
About the way he speaks?

535
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,565
Right, that's it,
you won't refuse my request, right?

536
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,527
Thanks for teaching me.

537
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,113
Over there.

538
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,407
Being a triad member...

539
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,701
you must have a unique appearance.

540
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,662
It's right
you have a gold chain with you.

541
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:11,375
You must try to look furious and severe.
Try it.

542
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:16,213
More furious. Show some anger.

543
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,299
Wrath.

544
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:27,516
Throw that nibble away.

545
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,977
This is it,
you know what you're going to say?

546
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:30,894
I seem to know.

547
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,480
Good, I'll remind you from time to time
in this dim place.

548
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,866
Tong, over here a bit, right, cheer up.

549
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,951
- Shooting a movie?
- What is it?

550
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,288
I forget already.

551
00:38:58,255 --> 00:38:59,673
You know, HK is in economic recession.

552
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,509
And being hit by financial storm,
it's all because of the 'Ross'.

553
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:03,719
There are many factors.

554
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:06,138
Now the S.E.
Asia collapses in economics...

555
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,891
and that infects HK too.

556
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,768
Those enterprises suffer much.

557
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:16,773
The worse is there'll be
global economics recession soon.

558
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,400
You have a view in economics.

559
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,736
I majored Economics in HKU.

560
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,362
Did you? I graduated this year.

561
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:25,365
Did you? I graduated in 1996,
this is my name card.

562
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,993
- You're my senior, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

563
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,829
- How come you shoot kids karaoke?
- I can't help.

564
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,211
What are you doing now?

565
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,713
Nothing, I fool with triad members.

566
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,216
Seeing you shooting movie here,
I come to collect protection money.

567
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,636
Brother Kei,
someone collects protection money.

568
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:48,764
Who collects protection money?

569
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,400
- Economics in HK is now...
- Is it you?

570
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,321
Good.

571
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,579
Bastard,
what triad groups are you come from?

572
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,145
Dare you to fool me?

573
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,408
Fix him!

574
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,371
Kill you!

575
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:58,167
Go to hell! Bastard...

576
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,173
Dare you play with my bird?
Don't you know me?

577
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,884
Don't come near...

578
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,052
It hurts...

579
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,681
Don't talk with me,
pretend we're at a duel.

580
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,851
Make a call...pretend calling for help.

581
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,024
I want to go home.

582
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,193
You must act on until I shout cut.

583
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,654
- You must be profession.
- I want to go home.

584
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,697
It's a day.

585
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,492
They're gone.

586
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,410
Don't be afraid, they're gone, all gone.

587
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:36,830
Take a chopper and a rush there,
get some fame.

588
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:50,719
What's wrong?

589
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,387
That scoundrel is still there.

590
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:56,058
Concentrate! you're scoundrel too,
show some anger!

591
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,143
I want to eat ice-cream.

592
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:01,104
Bastard! Show some anger!

593
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,205
You needn't do that.

594
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,137
Forget it, I fear you now.

595
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,481
What's up? You acted very well.

596
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,193
What has happened?

597
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,404
He acted really well to get this.

598
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,573
He managed to collect $20.

599
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,199
Why are you still crying?

600
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,785
You managed to get $20 protection money
in front of a temple.

601
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,620
You're making a fame for yourself.

602
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,164
You do look like a hero.

603
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,667
Keep the image and use it
to collect protection money now.

604
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:06,086
Brother Sau, you're competent, great!

605
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,045
You're flattering me.

606
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:10,007
Let's get a feast, with this $20.

607
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:15,262
What are you laughing at?
Keep this image, got it?

608
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,640
- Stop laughing! Cry!
- Stop laughing! Cry!

609
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,310
Be good, cry, cry now!

610
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:22,769
What are you laughing at! Cry now!

611
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,563
That under-graduate hold two choppers.

612
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:27,691
And rushes over
while crying and shouting.

613
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:30,736
He's crying loudly.

614
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:34,156
He is capable
to play the spirit of a triad member.

615
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:35,991
Thanks for his persistence,

616
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,452
He managed to get $20
as a protection money.

617
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:39,661
What are you talking about?

618
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:41,747
Persistence, Aunt Ha.

619
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,916
I believe that I'm a good actor,
do me a favour please.

620
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:46,001
I have new experience
about holding choppers.

621
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,628
I'd play well in a kung fu movie.

622
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,380
What?
You've brought enough trouble to me.

623
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:53,425
How dare you asking me for help?
Go away!

624
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:57,804
Sorry, Brother Sunny, he's leaving now.

625
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,641
I've looking for you.
Make up and get ready.

626
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,017
Thanks!

627
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,520
Director, we've found the stunt man.

628
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:06,522
You said you can't find one just then?
You're wasting my time!

629
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:07,689
I've found one now.

630
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:08,774
You have no problem?

631
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:12,027
No problem, I'll try my best to be
the stunt man for Sister Cuckoo.

632
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:13,320
Director, no problem.

633
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,155
Light the fire.

634
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,073
Director.

635
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,616
Beside responding with the hot fire,

636
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,827
Can I show an expression
of cool loneliness?

637
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:21,119
As you like,

638
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:24,081
As long as you don't turn your face
to the camera, get it?

639
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:25,207
Got it.

640
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:27,709
Light the fire, just don't move.

641
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,421
Ready.

642
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:33,549
Who put the pigeons here?

643
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:34,800
Director, I put them here intentionally.

644
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,718
There're pigeons here in our last shot.

645
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:39,930
If the pigeons fly,
they'll stir up the fire.

646
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,057
- Take them away.
- Director...

647
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,561
The mood of this shot will be better
if the pigeons are there.

648
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,020
How much better?

649
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,692
It's hard to say,
it's something abstract.

650
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,318
Anyway, the mood will be better.

651
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,195
Put them up and let's see the effect.

652
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,449
That stunt man mustn't turn his head!

653
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,285
Director, how do you like it?

654
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:02,953
It's a bit better.

655
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,708
Let's try the effect
with the pigeon's head towards me.

656
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:13,046
Now put the pigeon's tail towards me.

657
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,885
Take it away. Ready.

658
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:19,928
It's better without the pigeons,
take it away.

659
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:21,805
Ready.

660
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,016
Where's my lighter?

661
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:28,478
Man, bring me a lighter?

662
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:29,646
Director, here it is.

663
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:30,981
- Really?
- Yes.

664
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,608
- It works?
- Yes.

665
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,778
Hurry, quick, ready!

666
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,531
Ready, keep your posture, don't move.

667
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,783
Roll, action!

668
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:44,536
What is it?

669
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:52,044
What's wrong with you?
You screwed up every time!

670
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:53,795
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
it's very hot here.

671
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:56,131
I've told you already,
and you said no problem.

672
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:57,341
Shall we try again?

673
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:59,384
Again? Get a smarter guy.

674
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:01,011
It's your fault, Sunny?

675
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,805
Sorry, Director. Get lost!

676
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,269
I've tried my best to help you,
don't ever come again.

677
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,438
Just then...

678
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,357
Do you smell BBQ chicken wing?

679
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,235
I've sacrificed my arm
just for this movie.

680
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:18,362
Unit Manager, give him an over-cooked
chicken wing rice lunch box.

681
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,404
OK.

682
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:20,948
You, don't ever let me see him again...

683
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,241
Or I'll fire you instantly as well!

684
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,450
Aunt Ha...

685
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:26,245
Don't ask me anymore. Brother Sunny!

686
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,955
Chicken wings rice.

687
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:33,126
Let me see which is over-cooked,
the chicken wing or your arm.

688
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:35,504
Not over-cooked, go away now.

689
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,298
- Brother Sunny said I have a lunch box.
- Go away!

690
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:42,594
Extras are human being as well.

691
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,304
What? Repeat it loudly!

692
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,472
Aren't extras human?

693
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:46,849
Why must you always jump in me?

694
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:49,977
- You want to know the reason?
- I want to know the reason.

695
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,396
Because you're not entitled
to eat this lunch box!

696
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:57,568
You thought you're talented
and teach others acting.

697
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,486
You always talk about theory.

698
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:02,531
You teach someone to be a triad member
and collect protection money.

699
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,118
You're indeed insulting
the word 'acting'!

700
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:08,537
Don't shout on, let's get to work.

701
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,334
You talk about 'acting' in front of me?
Shit!

702
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,046
Damn it!

703
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,425
They dare to collect protection money
from those 2 ice-cream cars?

704
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,552
I'm the protector
of those 2 ice-cream cars.

705
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,596
They don't respect me at all.

706
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:27,598
Men, get some weapons
and teach them a lesson.

707
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:29,308
Sau, come with us.

708
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:31,685
You can experience
how we fight for our right,

709
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,687
and keep guard for us as well.
Men, let's go.

710
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:36,648
Little Hung, where are you going?

711
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:38,233
Granny, where are you doing here?

712
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:39,735
You're getting better
with you tuberculosis.

713
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,196
So mind you catch a cold,
have you taken your medicine?

714
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:45,073
Yes, you're going to
fight with someone again?

715
00:47:45,157 --> 00:47:46,074
No.

716
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,409
Don't go.

717
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,660
I'm not fighting with anyone.

718
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:51,997
- Don't go fighting.
- I'm not.

719
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:56,418
Granny, he isn't going to fight,
he's going to act in a play.

720
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:59,755
That Neighbour Theatre,
we're playing "Thunder Storm".

721
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:01,465
"Thunder Storm"? It's a good play.

722
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,759
Bruce Lee, Bark Yin,
Ng Chor Fan did it years ago.

723
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,219
There was great response,

724
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:06,762
so we're putting up one more show.

725
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,514
We're hurrying for the rehearsal.

726
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,724
You're acting in a play?

727
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,184
Yes.

728
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:18,440
Good, my grandson is an actor,
how smart he is!

729
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:21,235
I'm very happy!

730
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,737
OK, come on, go home now.

731
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:28,534
She's put much saliva on my face.

732
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:32,412
Your granny brought you up alone,
she's a real heroine.

733
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:33,831
You're not.

734
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,002
See how happy she is.

735
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:45,175
Stop fighting anymore,
come and join our rehearsal.

736
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:53,851
If you can defeat me,

737
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,478
I'll swallow this plate.

738
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,522
You aren't convinced?

739
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:02,109
You should speak with stressing tone
"You aren't convinced?"

740
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:04,653
This is raise my wrath from the inside.

741
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,864
No need, as no one is watching.

742
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,241
You suddenly want to play
"Fist of Fury".

743
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:12,119
And make us to wear this costume,
this way is too much.

744
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:15,038
I'm doing you a favour, right?

745
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:17,624
- I only want to change the wig.
- Let's leave.

746
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,434
That girl is pretty, your girlfriend?

747
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:36,560
Sure.

748
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,729
- Let's get serious, try again!
- Coming.

749
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,273
If you can defeat me.

750
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:44,693
I'll swallow this plate.

751
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:47,488
You aren't convinced?

752
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,623
Change the position, hurry.

753
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,715
We're concentrated
when acting on the stage.

754
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,176
It's dangerous if you suddenly rush up.

755
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,179
I want to join you as you guys
were fevering up there.

756
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,266
I chose "Fist Of Fury"
for some commercial reasons.

757
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,852
Because there're fighting scenes,
audience will like it.

758
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:01,687
The story is consisted
of blood and tears.

759
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:02,980
Speaking of blood and tears,

760
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,982
I wonder if my spine is injured.

761
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,151
Last time I was in a bad mood
and I slapped at your face.

762
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:08,944
So I came here to apologize.

763
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:12,823
I'm grateful
as you watched our play tonight.

764
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,700
- Thanks.
- You mean it?

765
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:20,164
Thanks...

766
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,459
Thanks.

767
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:30,382
Thanks for your encouragement,
I'll remember it.

768
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:31,675
You'll make it!

769
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,595
Last time you taught me
pretending to be shy...

770
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,681
and men really lift up my chin
and I said...

771
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,349
Morning, Sir.

772
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,810
They're all enchanted by me
and I'm making lots of money.

773
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:42,769
Really?

774
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:44,897
Surely,
I've made a fame in the night-club now.

775
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:45,814
Congratulations.

776
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,233
You will become an excellent club girl.

777
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,151
Thanks.

778
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:51,361
You will become
an excellent damned extra too.

779
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,654
Thanks.

780
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:05,667
Looks, it's so dark out there,
I can't see anything.

781
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,630
No, it'll become scenic when dawn comes.

782
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,262
I got to go.

783
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,141
Those 3 guys are dead beat.

784
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,812
What's wrong with you?

785
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:25,854
What's wrong with me?

786
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,399
Your lips are chapped,
you need lip balm?

787
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,651
Thanks.

788
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:39,284
I only have this, is it better?

789
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:42,704
Yes, it's better.

790
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,876
- You want some more?
- No, thanks.

791
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,088
Forget it then.

792
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,758
Go to hell, asshole!

793
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,759
What's wrong with you?

794
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:57,970
I hate people with chapped lips.

795
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,889
But I don't want to have chapped lips.

796
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:03,642
Why don't you
put some more lip balm then?

797
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,019
OK, I'll put on some more!

798
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:10,149
Go to hell, don't force yourself to!

799
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,443
I do want to put some more on.

800
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:14,570
I'm warning you,

801
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,780
don't nag when I put it on your lips.

802
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:20,409
I've said I want to put on some more.
Wait.

803
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:21,869
You asshole!

804
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:26,081
Put it on for me
like professional beautician, OK?

805
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,499
OK.

806
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,960
- Master Hung.
- What is it?

807
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:56,880
How much is a night-club hostess
charge for overnight?

808
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:59,424
Around $1000 to $1200
with a fair appearance.

809
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,969
- What if she's pretty?
- How pretty is she then?

810
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:04,096
I mean she's a real beauty.

811
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,849
About $1 million to $10 million.

812
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:14,500
Thanks, Boss.

813
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:37,272
What is it?

814
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,483
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

815
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,610
- Where are you going?
- Going home.

816
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,239
- And then?
- Going to work.

817
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:48,158
Is it possible if you don't go to work?

818
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,202
Are you supporting my living
if I don't go to work?

819
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:11,849
What now?

820
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:18,355
I'll support your living!

821
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:31,702
Take care of your living first, nuts.

822
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,293
Whether you despite me or not.

823
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,921
I'm an actor.

824
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:27,341
You're talking to me?

825
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:31,929
You're calling yourself an actor,
fuck you!

826
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:35,974
You owe me 3 lunch boxes,
I want to take them back now.

827
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,690
Take them!

828
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:47,903
Dare you take them!

829
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:20,894
Thanks.

830
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,569
- Wan Tin Sau!
- Stand there!

831
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,406
Don't run!

832
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,033
Aunt Ha, this is my lunch box.

833
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,743
As you like, someone's looking for you.

834
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:37,828
Come on.

835
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,675
Mandy, you may go now.

836
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:55,971
Go inside. Put down the lunch box.

837
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:11,236
Close the door!

838
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:23,290
Sister Cuckoo, director.

839
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:25,334
Take this seat.

840
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:28,170
I want you to do an audition now.

841
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,588
We're lovers.

842
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:32,132
Here is the dialogue before I die.

843
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,175
Take a look.

844
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:37,804
And my role is...

845
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,100
You play the role of Wan Tin Sau,
and I'll play the role of Cuckoo.

846
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:45,229
OK.

847
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:48,982
- Call "Action" now.
- Action.

848
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,153
Tin Sau...

849
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:02,329
Cuckoo...

850
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:05,374
Tin Sau...I...

851
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:11,004
You will be alright, Cuckoo...

852
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:13,715
I don't think I can make it...

853
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:22,516
Cuckoo, I've encountered too much
failure in my life.

854
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:26,478
I'm very tired.

855
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,982
If I lose you too.

856
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,319
I can't hold on anymore.

857
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,823
You...take care.

858
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:41,410
Don't go, Cuckoo...

859
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:48,167
Cuckoo, answer me...

860
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:51,003
Speak to me, Cuckoo, speak something,
Cuckoo...

861
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:56,758
Cuckoo...

862
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,678
Cut.

863
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:03,432
- Sister Cuckoo, clean it first.
- Get lost.

864
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,726
What's wrong? A running nose?

865
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,436
You were really absorbed in the role.

866
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,897
Not only absorbed in it,
very stunning too.

867
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:16,445
Let me tell you,
I won't wait for Big Brother.

868
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:18,489
You can compromise on the schedule
with Big Brother.

869
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:19,448
Who will compromise?

870
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,658
I've had it, I want a new partner.

871
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,702
You rather use this guy
than Big Brother?

872
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,622
Don't fucking, sorry.
Don't bullshit me, OK?

873
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:27,915
Cause I'm not doing business like this.

874
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:29,333
"Oh", don't you bullshit me.

875
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,043
We need some new blood.

876
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:32,461
New bloods are all around,

877
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:34,046
but we're making a big budgeted movie.

878
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:35,756
So you can't just introduce
a common guy like him to me.

879
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:36,882
He's not a common guy.

880
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,884
Mr. Shaw,
I've noticed him for quite some time.

881
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,177
He's a real professional actor.

882
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,846
What professional?
We're talking about business here.

883
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,348
Don't mix your personal feeling into it,
Sister Cuckoo.

884
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:45,724
Let me tell you something man.

885
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,976
I'm not going to work with these people
and that bitch.

886
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:49,770
I'm not gonna work with this man,

887
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:52,272
I don't want to see him,
I don't want to talk about it!

888
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:57,736
Mr. Shaw.

889
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:02,950
I want you to be the leading actor
in my next movie.

890
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:04,409
What do you think?

891
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:07,412
Good.

892
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:08,872
Here're the character,
background relationship.

893
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,123
Scenario, script...

894
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:12,501
And the novel,
you may take them home for reference.

895
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:13,961
I think they'll help you a lot.

896
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:17,047
Here're the schedules
and the character's images.

897
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:19,174
We'll get your measurement
as soon as possible.

898
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:20,634
Any problem?

899
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,389
I'll surely have a lunch box everyday?

900
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:23,238
Mama, I don't want
to do any business tonight.

901
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:25,240
What? You fool me again.

902
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:26,492
I'm not fooling you.

903
01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:28,619
No? You're fooling me right now.

904
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:31,413
Master Lung comes to see you,
he's willing to pay a lump sum.

905
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:33,790
You must treat him nicely tonight.

906
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,459
Stop fooling now.

907
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,377
I don't want to work anymore?

908
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:40,297
You don't want to work?
You think you're a virgin.

909
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:42,966
Why don't you just quit.

910
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,968
I've fallen in love with someone.

911
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:48,180
I don't know how to thank you
for giving me this chance.

912
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,390
Just try your very best.

913
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:54,812
I'll input all my strength
and time into this movie.

914
01:04:55,813 --> 01:04:59,233
I hope your girlfriend won't complain
if you can't accompany her.

915
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,777
I don't have girlfriend.

916
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,279
You'd rather choose love than money?

917
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,409
You're nuts! I don't care.

918
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:11,453
You must treat him tonight,
whatever you do.

919
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,247
We'll talk about it after that.

920
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:14,790
Miss, get up and get your handbag.

921
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:18,794
Master Lung, sorry,
I feel sick suddenly.

922
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:21,380
I'm afraid
I can't accompany you tonight, sorry.

923
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,299
Forget it, don't pretend like a virgin.

924
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,802
I have lots of money.

925
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:31,932
Take it, how's that?

926
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:37,312
I'm really feeling sick, I can't.

927
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:41,692
I don't want to hear "I can't".

928
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:44,653
Is that clear? Say again.

929
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:47,698
I really can't.

930
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:51,869
Is it hurt?

931
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:54,204
Didn't you say you're a dancing master?

932
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,415
Yes, I can dance very well.

933
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,041
Then what make you step on my feet?

934
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,460
Is it because your pace
is a bit too fast?

935
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:02,713
Can you slow down your beat,
just for me?

936
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:05,090
OK, just for you.

937
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:13,098
Bitch! Last time I spent over
thousands of dollar on you.

938
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:15,100
And now I came here and...

939
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,060
you turn me down?

940
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,188
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody here.

941
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,856
I'll give you another chance.

942
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,734
Say it again in front of everybody,
can you?

943
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:26,904
I can't.

944
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:30,908
Master Lung, stop beating her.
She's a little girl.

945
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,177
Master Lung, stop beating her.

946
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:51,970
Can you?

947
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:00,562
I can't!

948
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:12,908
Let's go.

949
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:18,539
Call someone for help!

950
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:22,709
- Morning!
- Morning!

951
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,177
- Morning!
- Morning!

952
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:35,973
- Are you Cuckoo Tu?
- Hello.

953
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,433
It's you? I'm Lau Piu Piu.

954
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,478
I'm your fans,
can I've your autograph, please?

955
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:43,105
You're very beautiful,

956
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:44,356
I love watching your movies.

957
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,861
It's Cuckoo, ask for her autograph,
she's leaving now.

958
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:52,197
In today's movie, You play the role
of a waiter at a Chinese restaurant?

959
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,825
Or a bell boy a hotel?

960
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:58,871
What's happened at your face?

961
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:01,248
Don't bother.

962
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,709
Cuckoo,
who are you dating with recently?

963
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,127
You guys are neighbours?

964
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:06,503
You know him?

965
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,590
Sister Cuckoo helps me,
she wants me to be leading actor.

966
01:08:09,715 --> 01:08:11,842
- Go to hell.
- It's true!

967
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:13,719
Sau, let's go.

968
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:15,596
Mr. Shaw doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

969
01:08:15,846 --> 01:08:17,681
- Really?
- Yes!

970
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:20,434
I've said
you can make it someday, remember?

971
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:22,644
I've said
he'll make it, he will make it.

972
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,229
Cuckoo, ask him if you don't believe me.

973
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:26,398
Sau, Mr. Shaw is flying
to the States this afternoon.

974
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:27,399
Let's hurry.

975
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:29,443
I think he wants to talk with you
before he departs.

976
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:32,321
Do you remember,
I've said you'll make a fame.

977
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:34,531
Didn't I say this
to you that night on the beach?

978
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,450
I really said that to him
on the beach that night.

979
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:37,743
The producer has reserved
the shooting range for you.

980
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:39,411
You must practise shooting.

981
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,413
He'll also teach you somersault,
and spring board.

982
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,041
And also fly with wire,
you have underwear on?

983
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,502
You must wear underwear
when flying with me.

984
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:47,461
I have.

985
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,213
- OK.
- Let's go.

986
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:56,386
Is your friend looking for you?

987
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:58,180
No.

988
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:01,141
I've something to give you back.

989
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:06,146
You took it.

990
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:08,732
Yes, I took it for fun.

991
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,859
For fun? Is it funny?

992
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:13,529
No, so I'm giving it back to you.

993
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:26,083
- Anything else?
- No.

994
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,253
Goodbye.

995
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:39,596
That's all.

996
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,570
You said you'll support my living,
are you serious?

997
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:01,577
Yes!

998
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,543
You mustn't cheat me.

999
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:13,422
I've said yes,
I'm only waiting for you to say "yes".

1000
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:23,932
Why don't you go aside and chat,
just don't be late.

1001
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:25,100
OK.

1002
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,925
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Never mind, come there.

1003
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:58,884
Let me introduce.

1004
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:00,469
This is Peter, our Producer,

1005
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:02,554
And Johnny, our Associate Producer.

1006
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:04,890
Mr. Wan, morning.

1007
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:07,142
- Morning!
- Morning.

1008
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:08,977
- Sit down.
- Please sit down.

1009
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,523
I've analysed the character.

1010
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,484
I've found there are 3 levels,
4 stages...

1011
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:17,861
And 5 different ways to act it.

1012
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:21,031
I've written it all down,
maybe we can discuss it.

1013
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:22,282
Very good.

1014
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:28,038
In order to let foreign audience
to accept me as a new actor...

1015
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:31,416
I'll have to
get an English name, Number.

1016
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,044
Number? Number One?

1017
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:35,838
Yes, Number One.

1018
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,090
Good, excellent.

1019
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:40,676
About the image, I also have...

1020
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:45,389
Tin Sau, the leading actor
was played by Big Brother.

1021
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:47,057
As he is too busy,

1022
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:49,059
we've decided to use a new actor.

1023
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:50,435
Just then he called us up,

1024
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:52,020
saying he has time for this movies.

1025
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:55,149
So he'll be the leading actor.

1026
01:11:57,609 --> 01:11:59,027
Then...

1027
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:05,617
If so,
I can play the role of the scoundrel.

1028
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,704
For me, this is also a challenge.

1029
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,040
Sorry, we've chosen the actor
who plays the role of scoundrel.

1030
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:18,630
Then...I think...there is...

1031
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:22,050
Mr. Wan, just as Cuckoo has said...

1032
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,553
we all know you're a professional actor.

1033
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:25,471
Don't worry.

1034
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:28,515
We'll get you another role.

1035
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,850
Thanks.

1036
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,313
What role is it?

1037
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:41,862
You play the role of the lawyer.

1038
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,574
Read the script,
and remember your lines.

1039
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,534
Get prepared.

1040
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,786
How many lines are there?

1041
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,586
You've three.

1042
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,671
What are they?

1043
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:08,555
- The first is: "What".
- What?

1044
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:11,809
- The second is: "Yes".
- Yes...

1045
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:16,063
The third is: "Go away".

1046
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:24,613
I understand. I'll study them well.

1047
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:29,117
Mr. Wan, mind giving us back the script?

1048
01:13:55,936 --> 01:13:57,271
Tin Sau.

1049
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:07,364
- Don't be like this.
- Sorry.

1050
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,286
Mr. Wan, please take off the costume.

1051
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:13,954
We have clothes for you to change.

1052
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:15,372
This way please.

1053
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:16,999
Tin Sau.

1054
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:21,170
Sorry.

1055
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:27,509
Sister Cuckoo,
about the schedule of Big Brother...

1056
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:28,844
Go out first.

1057
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:30,345
It's usual in movie business.

1058
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:31,847
Get out!

1059
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:52,784
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

1060
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:58,665
My life is cheaper than ants.

1061
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:05,589
You ride a Mercedes,
while I pick my nose.

1062
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:11,053
It's worse than dying.

1063
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:16,892
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

1064
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,964
Kid, still want to play a character?

1065
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:50,133
- How may lines?
- Definitely more than 3.

1066
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:52,427
- What kind of role is it?
- A good guy.

1067
01:15:53,137 --> 01:15:54,054
What movies is it?

1068
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:56,140
Don't ask so much, are you interested?

1069
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:57,641
- Yes.
- Come here.

1070
01:16:08,193 --> 01:16:09,528
What is the situation?

1071
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,029
I'm working on it.

1072
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,531
Frankly.

1073
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,658
I'm not a real Unit Manager.

1074
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,953
I'm Police Officer, he's my supervisor.

1075
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:20,372
We're from Criminal Intelligency Bureau.

1076
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:21,707
Or short-formed as C.I.B.

1077
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,917
To make it simple, I'm an undercover.

1078
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:25,252
You're an undercover?

1079
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,255
You don't believe that? I'm much better
than those so-called actors.

1080
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:30,674
I'm more skillful.

1081
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,926
Because I'm acting every day
when I work here.

1082
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:36,054
Though I have no script,
I never make any NG.

1083
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:38,474
Because any NG
will cause the death of me.

1084
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,060
So I should be the Best Actor in Oscar.

1085
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:43,896
Mighty!

1086
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,734
Today I should be going on
a mission with my informant.

1087
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:51,987
But he suffers from epilepsy suddenly,
be can't go with me.

1088
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:54,490
I want you to substitute him,

1089
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:56,366
We'll pay you $800
for being our informant.

1090
01:16:57,242 --> 01:17:00,537
Money is not important,
I only want to practise my acting.

1091
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:01,872
You surely can.

1092
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,633
Big Brother, policemen are outside,
you'd better run away.

1093
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,260
Buddy, just left, I'll stay behind.

1094
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:23,852
You betray me?

1095
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,772
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

1096
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,027
What make me pull the trigger?

1097
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:34,238
I'll go to the robber's place
in an hour.

1098
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:37,491
And I want to install bugs
to collect their criminal evidence.

1099
01:17:37,616 --> 01:17:39,868
But every time I got there,
they'll search me thoroughly.

1100
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:43,997
So, I want you to deliver a lunch box
to me, with the bugs inside.

1101
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:44,998
Then you go away.

1102
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,834
- You mean I am...
- The delivery boy.

1103
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:47,960
I have no...

1104
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:50,754
Your role is important,
grasp the chance.

1105
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:53,257
What about the character,
the relation and background?

1106
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,467
The character,
the relation and background...

1107
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:58,554
are all on the menu of the coffee shops.

1108
01:17:58,679 --> 01:17:59,972
Study them now.

1109
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:03,600
But you must act accordingly
when you are on the scene.

1110
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:04,768
Why choose me?

1111
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:06,979
We need a professional actor.

1112
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:08,438
I think that person is you.

1113
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:10,524
You're the leading actor this time.

1114
01:18:23,954 --> 01:18:25,372
What is there in a Mixed Grill?

1115
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:27,166
Pork chop, beef steak, chicken wing,
sausage, egg.

1116
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,417
And Set Lunch A?

1117
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,877
Sunny-side-up-egg, minced beef rice,
chicken corn soup.

1118
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,170
Coffee or tea.

1119
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:32,087
And Set Lunch B?

1120
01:18:32,296 --> 01:18:34,047
Vegetable and pork rice, Chef'ss soup,
tea or coffee.

1121
01:18:34,256 --> 01:18:36,216
- The charge for a cold drink is...
- $2.

1122
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,593
What is served all day round?

1123
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:38,927
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger.

1124
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,095
How much?

1125
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,766
- $20.
- Study it better, man.

1126
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,059
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger...

1127
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:47,478
What is there for in a Mixed Grill?

1128
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,688
You're a delivery boy now.

1129
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:51,190
Remember to play the role well.

1130
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:53,066
I'll go into their place soon.

1131
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:55,027
I'll order the steamed rice with tomato
and egg at once.

1132
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:57,863
You must deliver it to me
in exactly 10 minutes.

1133
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:00,199
Let's start.

1134
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:02,367
- It's formal?
- Yes.

1135
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:04,620
- No more rehearsal?
- No.

1136
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:08,999
- Could you say "Action" first
- Action.

1137
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:32,523
- Ben.
- Mao!

1138
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:34,274
Why didn't you ask me
to go to Macau with you?

1139
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:35,359
I did page you for that.

1140
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:36,777
When did you page me?

1141
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:37,694
I think you didn't turn the pager on.

1142
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:40,405
How come? I turn it on 24 hours.

1143
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:43,242
No wonder you're so poor.

1144
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,785
Hey, check my dick...

1145
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,121
This bastard takes advantages of
others all the time.

1146
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,331
Feel free to check it.

1147
01:19:50,415 --> 01:19:52,459
Chu, greet Brother Mao.

1148
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,128
Just call me Mao, Brother Chu.

1149
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,757
Leather jacket again? Is it a gathering
for leather jacket wears?

1150
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:01,176
We've the same design too.

1151
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:04,221
I'm here to deliver food...

1152
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:06,056
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5, please.

1153
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:07,474
- Kee.
- Yes.

1154
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,309
His jacket is worn out naturally.

1155
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:10,561
Look at the texture.

1156
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:14,064
His jacket must be worn
for at least 20 years.

1157
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:17,234
- Your grandpa left it to you?
- I bought it recently.

1158
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:21,780
Bastard.

1159
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:27,744
I want one too.

1160
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:41,675
Order some food now.

1161
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,385
Time for meal.

1162
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:45,804
- Come over, help me.
- Time to eat.

1163
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:47,347
Mao, come here.

1164
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:55,439
Let's chat while eating.

1165
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:58,108
OK, good dishes!

1166
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:00,944
Good dishes? We can eat something
much better after the project.

1167
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:02,404
Project?

1168
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:04,907
Wait...no tomato and egg?

1169
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:07,784
I want tomato and egg,
I want rice with tomato and egg.

1170
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:10,412
No need, want tomato and egg?
Here it comes.

1171
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:11,705
How come?

1172
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,709
It's really tomato and egg, bingo.

1173
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,129
Scrambled egg?

1174
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:21,507
No, I want sunny-side-up.

1175
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:23,759
Let me order sunny-side-up with tomato.

1176
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:26,094
Sunny-side-up? Chu,
make one for him now.

1177
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:30,599
Why making trouble?
Delivery service is convenient.

1178
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,684
You're asking for trouble indeed.

1179
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:34,978
Is it Kuen Fat?

1180
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:42,110
How come the delivery is so fast?

1181
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:43,654
Yeah, I haven't ordered yet.

1182
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:49,827
Why is it taking so long?

1183
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:51,954
I still have something else to deliver,
men.

1184
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:53,455
Have you ordered anything?

1185
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:56,583
I ordered it, mutton stew.

1186
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,252
How come it is here so quick?

1187
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,336
Is it well done?

1188
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:02,256
Ask the cook for that, $39.8 please!

1189
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:04,174
- I'll pay.
- No need.

1190
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:05,592
Why not? Let me pay.

1191
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:07,219
- I've said I'll pay.
- It's alright.

1192
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:08,595
I will pay.

1193
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,181
You pay next time, it's my bill.

1194
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:15,018
No...don't do that.

1195
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:16,895
Let me treat you this time!

1196
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:20,357
Just $40
and you two push around and around.

1197
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:21,984
Why don't you pay by credit card,
asshole!

1198
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:23,485
What did you say, bastard?

1199
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:26,780
Don't move, either you pay now
or I'll take it back.

1200
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:28,073
Or I'll pay for you.

1201
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:32,744
What are you doing?

1202
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:35,914
I've said many times,
why don't you walk closer?

1203
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:37,666
Walk closer and shoot him from the top.

1204
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,918
Then blood won't splash on the wall.

1205
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:43,172
You never listen to me.
Can't you be a professional?

1206
01:22:52,431 --> 01:22:55,100
But delivery boys
are very rude these days.

1207
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,643
They are always like this.

1208
01:22:57,311 --> 01:22:58,437
Let's eat.

1209
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:00,814
Who is it?

1210
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:04,485
I'm here to deliver some food.

1211
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,323
Go and take a look, Chu...

1212
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,792
How are you,
I'm here to delivery some food.

1213
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,294
OK.

1214
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,881
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5 please.

1215
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:26,882
You ordered that?

1216
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:29,635
No, I haven't.

1217
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:33,055
You haven't ordered?

1218
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,515
Have you come to the wrong place?

1219
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:40,354
- No.7.
- No.7?

1220
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,942
It's No.1, send it to No.1.

1221
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,402
Do you still want it?

1222
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:50,614
Are you out of your mind,
I didn't order it.

1223
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:51,949
Rice with tomato and egg?

1224
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:01,458
What do you mean? Are you nuts, Go away.

1225
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,838
You want rice with tomato and egg,
I'll take it.

1226
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:07,673
No, someone else ordered it.

1227
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:11,093
I said I want it, come here.

1228
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:15,514
Come here!

1229
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:17,474
Can you give it to us first?

1230
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:27,651
What a coincidence! No.1 also
ordered rice with tomato and egg.

1231
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:28,944
Is tomato and egg good?

1232
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:31,905
The egg and tomato are both nutritious.

1233
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:32,906
What do you mean nutritious?

1234
01:24:33,073 --> 01:24:34,992
It contains a lot of Vitamin C.

1235
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:36,368
Other fruits contain that too.

1236
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,245
Other fruits don't contain
as much as tomato.

1237
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:39,746
You don't want the money?

1238
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:42,583
$25.5 please.

1239
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:43,709
How come it's so expensive?

1240
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:45,544
- It's one and a half order.
- How much for one order?

1241
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:46,879
$36.8.

1242
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:48,172
How come it is more expensive?

1243
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:49,673
It's 12.2 for one order.

1244
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:50,674
And how much for one and a half order?

1245
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:51,800
$36.8.

1246
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:53,051
You just said $25.5.

1247
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:54,887
It's $25.5.

1248
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:56,263
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

1249
01:24:56,305 --> 01:24:57,097
What?

1250
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:58,765
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

1251
01:24:58,932 --> 01:24:59,933
Ham and egg.

1252
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:01,268
How much is it?

1253
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:02,311
$12.2.

1254
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:03,520
How much if I want one and a half order?

1255
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:04,646
$25.5.

1256
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,190
How come there is
one and a half order for breakfast?

1257
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:08,442
You can order two extra sausages.

1258
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:10,527
How much if I want 3 extra sausages?

1259
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:11,570
Don't do that.

1260
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:13,113
How much is it?

1261
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:15,032
I'm only a delivery boy.

1262
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,533
I ask you how much it is.

1263
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:19,453
I don't know.

1264
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:20,704
How much?

1265
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:22,789
I'm really a delivery boy!

1266
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:25,250
You are not!

1267
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:29,922
Kid, tell us frankly,
are you a delivery boy?

1268
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:32,508
- I've just started work today!
- Just started work today?

1269
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:34,718
I didn't know being delivery boy
must answer so many questions.

1270
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:36,011
Don't fucking fool me?

1271
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:38,889
What are you doing? Are you a cop?

1272
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:40,224
Yes, what's wrong?

1273
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:41,725
I'm really a delivery boy.

1274
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:47,564
Nothing...he's an idiot.

1275
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:50,359
Search him if you don't believe.
Search him!

1276
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:57,449
Kid, I let you go now,
be smart in future!

1277
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:04,748
What is it?

1278
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,380
Why did you do this?

1279
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:19,596
What do you want?

1280
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:28,897
What is it?

1281
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:34,570
Want to harm me?

1282
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:17,362
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

1283
01:27:30,751 --> 01:27:32,044
Cut.

1284
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:35,756
How's that?

1285
01:27:36,006 --> 01:27:37,966
I'm fine, I'm still alive.

1286
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:40,594
I mean my performance.

1287
01:27:40,886 --> 01:27:44,598
Very well, as this is your first time
being the leading actor.

1288
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:46,350
Good take.

1289
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,186
Thanks.

1290
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:50,979
I'll call to police.

1291
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:57,402
- Police!
- Freeze!

1292
01:27:57,486 --> 01:27:58,695
He's on my side...

1293
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:00,614
Call the ambulance!

1294
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:11,375
Piu Piu.

1295
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:15,462
What's going on? It's dark already,
and you didn't give me a call?

1296
01:28:15,546 --> 01:28:17,297
- Shall I cook dinner for you?
- Just then I...

1297
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:19,508
What's happen to you?
Didn't you play as the leading actor?

1298
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:21,969
I don't care whether
you're a leading actor or an extra.

1299
01:28:22,136 --> 01:28:23,554
You must support my living forever.

1300
01:28:23,804 --> 01:28:25,931
Come on, try it
and see if it suits or not.

1301
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:29,560
Red? Is it lipstick?
You're dating someone else?

1302
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,353
I forgive you but...

1303
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:34,231
I won't cook for you
if you dare next time, go!

1304
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:39,444
What are you looking at?
Fight back, nuts!

1305
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:45,742
Piu Piu, I love you.

1306
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,430
Wait

1307
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:09,349
You two mustn't get married!

1308
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:10,559
Why?

1309
01:29:10,684 --> 01:29:13,187
Because you guys are brother and sister.

1310
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:17,733
Sister, I'm sorry.

1311
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:20,944
It's not your business,
I'm willing myself.

1312
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:23,906
Your mood is wrong for this situation.

1313
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:25,115
I've told you before.

1314
01:29:25,324 --> 01:29:28,827
Mood begins from your heart,
then goes to the outside of your body...

1315
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:29,786
and returns to the heart, got it?

1316
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:32,623
- Yes, got it.
- Don't be nervous.

1317
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:34,208
I'm not nervous.

1318
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:38,545
Sau, I think
the role of Master suits you more.

1319
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,214
Why don't you play it?

1320
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,675
Forget it, I'm not talented in acting.

1321
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:45,761
I'd better be audience.

1322
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,554
Not at all.

1323
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:48,555
You're good.

1324
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,766
Brother Sau,
audience are waiting outside.

1325
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:51,892
- Are they?
- Hurry up.

1326
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:53,852
- Take off your clothes first.
- For what?

1327
01:29:54,019 --> 01:29:54,812
I'll play it.

1328
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:56,522
- Oh, no.
- Give it to me.

1329
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:57,981
But you're not talented.

1330
01:29:58,106 --> 01:29:59,191
I'm not? Are you talented then?

1331
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:00,400
I am.

1332
01:30:01,068 --> 01:30:02,277
Give it to me!

1333
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,781
- No.
- Sau, stop fighting.

1334
01:30:05,948 --> 01:30:08,826
Stop fighting, eat potato chips,
why fighting for?

1335
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,554
There're really many audience.

1336
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:31,515
Sure, as we have special guests today.

1337
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:33,475
Sister Cuckoo comes to help us today.

1338
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:36,228
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

1339
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:38,188
You're welcome, we finally have
the chance to act on the same stage.

1340
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:39,439
Thanks!

1341
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:43,569
Kung Hei Fat Choi! Thanks!

1342
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:44,778
Happy New Year.

1343
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:47,322
Congraduation! Everybody cheers up.

1344
01:30:47,406 --> 01:30:49,158
Thanks! Kung Hei!
