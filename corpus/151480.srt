1
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,653
I hear you're having troubIes.
No wonder! Look at you.

2
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,167
You wanna change your Iife
so you come to hear the story.

3
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,567
High schooI popuIarity ain't a contest,
it's a war.

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,436
Dizzy Harrison
is its greatest casuaIty.

5
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,941
See, his story
is reaIIy my story.

6
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,705
Because behind
every so-caIIed hero...

7
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,545
...is a IittIe pissed off dude
that don't get no credit!

8
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,217
We have to go back a ways.

9
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:35,953
Even as a smaII chiId, Dizzy Harrison
had his own particuIar styIe.

10
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,764
As you can see, I didn't
have a Iot to work with.

11
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,480
I hurt myseIf!

12
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,316
{Y:i}Things didn't get any
{Y:i}better from there,

13
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,325
{Y:i}As the years went by,
{Y:i}he got taller, whiter, skinnier,

14
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,027
First day, senior year.

15
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,724
And we're gonna be
the top dogs.

16
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,672
-I wish I'd drowned this summer.
-We aII do, Kirk.

17
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,575
We'II aIways be BIips.

18
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,182
-BIips?
-We're bareIy on the radar!

19
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,014
-Not this year. We're seniors now.
-I'm with Dizzy on this one.

20
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,488
It's never too Iate
to make a change.

21
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,890
FuII metaI jacket.

22
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,129
Dad, put those away!

23
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,766
You're such a dork!

24
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,936
I say we baiI.
Home schooIing?

25
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:01,630
-My dad couId teach drinking.
-Nobody baiIs, bands stick together.

26
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:10,305
Guys, reIax. Music has
the power to transform.

27
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,281
-There's some pain.
-Good Iuck, son!

28
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,687
Yo, BIip? LittIe heIp?

29
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,259
I'II never get used to that.

30
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,863
Can anyone heIp me?

31
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,998
Get out of the way!

32
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:42,540
-You're not going to taIk to her.
-That is Tina Ass-good, man!

33
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,378
Like a wood eIf versus AI'Kabor.
You'II get power IeveIed!

34
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,350
We're not pIaying EverQuest,
we're on earth.

35
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,456
Speak for yourseIf.

36
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,925
I'm going in.

37
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,395
Take that.

38
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,523
I know I can do this.

39
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,827
-Tina!
-You are?

40
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,834
Dizzy.

41
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,338
-You gonna heIp me, or what?
-Yeah!

42
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,873
You got to know your....

43
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,780
It's very technicaI.

44
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,818
A BIip is taIking to Tina Osgood.
Look at my boy!

45
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,254
Didn't they tie you up Iast year and
make you wear rubber breasts?

46
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,557
You remember!
That's reaIIy sweet.

47
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,166
I imagine God having an ass Iike that.
Did that sound gay?

48
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,268
I've been thinking,
we're seniors now...

49
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,735
...and maybe sometime, if you
wanted to drink coffee...

50
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,805
...near me...

51
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,209
...I wouId pay.

52
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,140
-TruthfuIIy?
-Yeah?

53
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,180
-You're not my--
-Type.

54
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,317
You know those moments
when a man makes...

55
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,853
...a decision that'II change his Iife...

56
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,014
...and he steps up to become the hero
he was meant to be?

57
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,285
This ain't one of those moments.

58
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,122
I thought about this type thing.

59
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,926
To be honest,
you're not my type either.

60
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,729
Did you think that'd work?

61
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,895
No, but I thought it was
worth giving it a shot.

62
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,008
You know something?

63
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,043
Yo, freak!
What are you doing?

64
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,578
TaIking.
Innocent conversation.

65
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,808
Innocent? Then what's this?

66
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:33,684
-Oh, my God! That's disgusting!
-Loser, nice pup tent!

67
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,952
We need to cover you up.

68
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,093
What is this?

69
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,496
Mrs. Whitman! It's my....

70
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,735
It's mine now!

71
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,274
Is this a weapon? You can't bring
Ioaded weapons to schooI!

72
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,676
You're tearing the skin!

73
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,715
My deaI!

74
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,184
I'm showing this to PrincipaI ZayIor.

75
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,947
Cut it out!

76
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,714
I know what you're thinking.
It's not medicaIIy possibIe.

77
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,684
But Iet me ask you this.
Are you a doctor?

78
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,659
I have good news.
Your son's condition is treatabIe.

79
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,990
What condition? The fact
that I can pee around a corner?

80
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,222
Watch your mouth.

81
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,200
He can't heIp it. What's wrong
with Dizzy, in medicaI terms...

82
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,703
...it's caIIed Tourette's syndrome.

83
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,506
Tourette's syndrome?

84
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,111
-Are you out of your fucking mind?
-Language, son.

85
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,273
You won't cure him with force,
Papa Bear.

86
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,478
It's going to take a Iot of hugs
and a Iot of drugs.

87
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,989
OnIy take one of these a day.
Nice pack.

88
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,633
There he is.

89
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,427
Diz?

90
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,370
They gave me these piIIs for my
Tourette's, but they're not working.

91
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,806
Come on, it's not that bad.

92
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,337
Not that bad?

93
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,175
At Ieast as BIips...

94
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,180
...we were invisibIe.

95
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,549
You break your dick in front
of the whoIe schooI...

96
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,589
-...peopIe remember that.
-His Iife is ruined.

97
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,759
I mean, I'm an idiot.

98
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,123
I'II never be abIe to go back
to schooI again.

99
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,992
I need more of these piIIs.

100
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:03,934
How can you be depressed with aII this
beautifuI church music pIaying?

101
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,155
Yes, yes, yes!

102
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:31,800
Thank you, brothers and sisters
of the Sunshine GospeI Choir.

103
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,405
Very stirring.
Very hip.

104
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,133
-Amen!
-Yes, yes, yes.

105
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,771
Now, do the rest of you young
peopIe know what eIse is hip?

106
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,918
SexuaI abstinence.
Can I get an amen on that?

107
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,416
Amen!

108
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,022
-GIory haIIeIujah!
-GIory haIIeIujah!

109
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,716
-I said, gIory haIIeIujah!
-GIory haIIeIujah!

110
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,419
GIory haIIeIujah!

111
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,024
Ladies and gentIemen...

112
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,633
...brothers and sisters...

113
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,033
...I'd Iike to taIk to you
aII about sex!

114
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:11,232
-The deviI's middIe name, sex!
-Amen!

115
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:16,143
Do you know what the best form
of sexuaI abstinence is?

116
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,782
Being me.

117
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,420
-Can I get an amen?
-Amen!

118
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,148
Do you wanna taIk about some pain?
Let me hear you!

119
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,759
-That boy's got the spirit!
-He's an idiot!

120
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:34,160
Has a member of the opposite sex
ever toId you you're not her type?

121
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,801
Let me hear you shout amen...

122
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:42,464
...if you ever had duct tape ripped
off your naked buttocks!

123
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:48,238
Let me hear you shout amen if you
ever had your manhood right-angIed...

124
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,248
...in front of the
entire congregation!

125
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,421
Now Iet me hear you shout
amen up high.

126
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,523
-Amen!
-Let me hear you shout amen!

127
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,059
{Y:i}Diz was in pain, He was in trouble,
{Y:i}He needed guidance,

128
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:08,597
{Y:i}He's about to get a lesson in bad,
{Y:i}from the best in the business,

129
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,134
What happened to Paco?

130
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:20,005
-I got no answer to that question.
-Back up. The new man is mine.

131
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,114
Not the crazy eyes, Luther.
I was just messing.

132
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,011
Been Iooking at my Janet?

133
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,378
No. No way.

134
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:35,721
Eighteen years and 41 days,
it's me and you, baby.

135
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,358
Okay, I'm scared.

136
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,802
Guard?

137
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,429
ReIax, white boy.

138
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,338
What'd you do to get in here?

139
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,414
I'm not reaIIy sure. I've been
heaviIy medicated IateIy...

140
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:02,952
...and the Iast thing that I remember
is my dad dropping me off at schooI.

141
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,623
-You in high schooI?
-Yes.

142
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,189
I stiII get chiIIs thinking about it.

143
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,887
Fish sticks!

144
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,228
I've officiaIIy become the
biggest Ioser at my schooI.

145
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,032
I don't think I'II
be going back there.

146
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,174
It's okay.

147
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,842
I know what you mean.

148
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,446
-I see that.
-I was the bitch at the Iast prison!

149
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:33,607
I remember, they strapped me
to a chair with duct tape...

150
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,754
-...in a dress.
-With makeup?

151
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,917
-And fake rubber breasts.
-Rubber breasts!

152
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,462
My brother...

153
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,360
...come on over here and sit down.

154
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,065
A high schooI...

155
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,135
...it's a Iot Iike prison.

156
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,739
Bad food, high fences.

157
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,708
The sex you want, you ain't getting.
The sex you getting...

158
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,813
...you don't want.

159
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,575
I seen terribIe things.

160
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:11,018
Yesterday, an 80-year-oId
Iibrarian broke my penis.

161
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,156
You win.

162
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,158
How did you change things?

163
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,924
I got myseIf thrown out of the Iast
prison and I started fresh here.

164
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,725
That worked?

165
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,926
Watch this.

166
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,908
Wow!

167
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:36,571
That's what I gotta do.
Switch prisons and start over.

168
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,809
You gotta teII me what you
did to get kicked out.

169
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,476
The first thing I did...

170
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,815
...is broke aII the ruIes.

171
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,049
I can break aII the ruIes.

172
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,255
-Then I started acting crazy.
-Yeah! I can act aII crazy.

173
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:58,402
I grabbed a broken mop handIe and
snapped it across the warden's butt.

174
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,508
I don't have to do this aIone.
Let's aII get expeIIed together.

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,740
-That's okay. You can go.
-What about you, GIen?

176
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,942
No, I taIk big, but I'm
not as tough as I Iook.

177
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,246
Okay, here we go.

178
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,555
What are you thinking, Mr. Harrison?

179
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,197
You know, you're right.
What am I thinking?

180
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,397
Everybody, the answer
to number 23 is Guam.

181
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,005
-Thanks, Broke-wood.
-Mr. Luberoff?

182
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,574
PIenty more where this came
from at finaIs time.

183
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:46,607
My Lord, Dizzy! Cheating, bribery?
Those are grounds for expuIsion!

184
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,652
Or an obvious cry for heIp.

185
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,724
What's Broke-wood doing?

186
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,282
That's PrincipaI ZayIor!

187
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,557
You're a fighter!

188
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,928
Try this!

189
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,664
Shit it! Shit it!
Say mercy!

190
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,140
You're aImost
at the head of the cIass!

191
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,585
And, cut!

192
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,488
This is the part of my job I hate.

193
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,959
ExpeIIing peopIe?

194
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,430
No, siIIy. We're going
to doubIe your medication...

195
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:13,799
...increase your therapy,
and you may have to stay another year.

196
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,464
Loser, how's it hanging?

197
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,473
That toiIet-cam
was your best work ever.

198
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,013
Looks Iike I'm stuck here
for the rest of my Iife.

199
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,079
Or am I?

200
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,895
-Hey! Hey!
-What are you doing?

201
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,032
HaIt!

202
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you just break that mop?
Give me that!

203
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,799
Yes!

204
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,740
You destroyed schooI property.
You're expeIIed.

205
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,539
Yes!

206
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,808
-I did it. I busted out.
-I knew you had it in you.

207
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,785
-Ready to be Luthercized?
-Preach, my brother!

208
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:09,053
I'm gonna take you
from bitch to buII.

209
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,196
You wanna get a reputation
at your new schooI...

210
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,397
...you'II have to crack
open heads, day one.

211
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,634
Find the biggest, baddest cat
and whup his ass!

212
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:31,977
-Make sure everybody sees him go down.
-Everybody sees him go down. Got it.

213
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,383
You know, some peopIe are born
with that knowIedge.

214
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,949
-Like BarcIay.
-Who's BarcIay?

215
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,322
He's the buIIy at my Iast schooI.

216
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,488
He might be born with it but with
my insights, street smarts...

217
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,501
...and knowIedge of every action
movie, we're gonna perfect it.

218
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,673
Don't worry about that.
Happens every day.

219
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,839
Same cat. Never gets away.
Come on.

220
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:11,615
First thing you do is gouge the dude's
eyes out so he can't see to fight.

221
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,952
Hey, this kid's in high schooI.

222
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,427
Then you're going to want to fight
dirty. AII right, set your feet.

223
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,599
Spread your paIms.

224
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,563
Tiger CIaw!

225
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,704
Are you sure it's not Tiger Paw?

226
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,335
Tiger CIaw!
Now you're ready!

227
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,810
Just watch my hands.

228
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,887
Grab some rope.
You gotta buiId some muscIe.

229
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,822
You act Iike you can't get up there.

230
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,895
Motivation is on the way.

231
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,090
Yes, indeedy, feed the needy.
There you go!

232
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,428
Luther, what are you doing?

233
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,232
-Get up there! That's it.
-What's that burning? It's me!

234
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,872
Just roII around.
You'II be aII right.

235
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,538
If you can't act tough,
you gotta Iook tough.

236
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,988
Butch up, girIie-pants!

237
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,217
-Got a sec?
-What?

238
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,088
Phone caII for you, warden.

239
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,092
My wife again?

240
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,738
I'II never get tired of that.

241
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,211
You taIk the taIk,
you gotta waIk the waIk.

242
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,713
Otherwise, you'II be Iined in chaIk.

243
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,750
Let me introduce you to somebody.

244
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,887
The Funkmaster.

245
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,257
Somebody, give me a beat!

246
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,332
Them crazy eyes?

247
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,532
Like someone hits you in the head and
your eyes aImost jump out your skuII!

248
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,699
Try it!

249
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,314
This is the ''Brother,
where my money'' waIk.

250
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,039
Where it at?

251
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,152
About to bust a cap.
About to bust a cap.

252
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,080
FIare your nostriI up!
You gotta open them up.

253
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,022
So everybody can see the rocks,
the boogers up in there.

254
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,232
Loosen the ass.

255
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,736
That's too Ioose.

256
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,434
They'II pIay you Iike a bitch, you
gotta hit them with the bitch first!

257
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,240
Like, ''Who's the bitch now?''

258
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,416
Watch this.

259
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,519
Try it. Try it!

260
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,526
Who's the bitch now?

261
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,904
HaIf Brad Pitt {Y:i}Fight Club, haIf Anne
Heche {Y:i}lf These Walls Could Talk.

262
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,971
For your student I.D.

263
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,405
Your new driver's Iicense.

264
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,074
This one's for the PIayer's CIub.

265
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,813
That ain't right.

266
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:34,516
ReaIIy cock it! You know what
I'm saying? Cock it! Fire! Cock it!

267
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,786
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

268
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,760
Tiger CIaw!

269
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,943
Dude, pretty nice.

270
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,045
Now you ready for your new prison.

271
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,758
Mascot, you dropped your bagpipe.

272
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,931
Thank you.

273
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,123
Suck on that, paI!

274
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,235
Tuba midget!

275
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,365
Have a nice day!

276
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,499
This pIace is a zoo!

277
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,872
He did say 1 2:30.

278
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,980
So where is he?

279
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,356
What the heII is that?

280
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,136
Good Iuck, kid.

281
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,912
FIip him!

282
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,916
Back in the truck!

283
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,959
Is that...

284
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,789
...Diz?

285
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,735
Oh, my God!

286
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,242
He's got kind of a...

287
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,676
...Brad Pitt thing going there.

288
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,848
From bitch to buII, baby.

289
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:28,092
I saw a IittIe Anne Heche there too.
Does that sound gay?

290
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,533
''Find the biggest, baddest mother in
the yard, and knock his ass out.''

291
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:41,478
Lift your knees, maggots! Maybe we'II
win one sorry-ass game this year!

292
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,874
I'm gonna puke.

293
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:47,780
Use it. Keep Iooking
at the horse's ass and run!

294
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,124
Biggest and baddest.

295
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,900
More cheer, Iess poIe dance.

296
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,198
Don't want guys stuffing
biIIs down your panties.

297
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,637
What panties?

298
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,580
Don't I have a dreamy boyfriend?

299
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,156
Make sure everybody
sees him go down.

300
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,122
CarefuI.

301
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,194
You mind if I sit down?

302
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,593
Wrong IeveI, bitch.

303
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,166
Bitch, say what?

304
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,166
I think we got
a serious probIem here.

305
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,279
If it's you, there's no prob--

306
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,072
Dude, what's with you?

307
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,336
Who's the bitch now?

308
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:32,117
You guys might want to come
scoop up your friend.

309
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,755
Shit!

310
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,947
Oh, God!

311
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,394
What are you doing?

312
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:17,125
Knocking you into the haII
and me into the history books.

313
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,037
Who's the bitch now?

314
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,442
You've gotta be kidding me!

315
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,537
Don't go that way.

316
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,416
HeIp!

317
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:27,229
Who's the bitch now?

318
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,208
Coming through!

319
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:38,348
Look out! Coming through!
Take your hat off in schooI!

320
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:49,524
Let's have a round of appIause
for Conner Maguire.

321
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,786
Everyone?

322
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,431
Come on. Everyone?

323
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,759
Come on.
Don't be shy!

324
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,868
Stop it, aII of you!

325
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,237
HeIIo, son.

326
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:11,541
I toId you Iast time, you start
something, you're what? You're gone!

327
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,379
WeII, my friend,
Iooks Iike it's Iast caII.

328
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,713
Last caII?

329
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,754
He didn't start it.
I did.

330
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,795
-Who the heII are you?
-I'm the new guy.

331
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,768
-How's the nose?
-Shut up!

332
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,773
Look at that freak,
sitting on top of the tower.

333
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,852
-Move!
-We shouId unroII the weIcome mat.

334
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,817
I shouId go kick his ass.

335
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,617
I've dreamed of dating
the expeIIed guy.

336
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,090
ExpeIIed guys rock!

337
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,626
Later.

338
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,555
Later.

339
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,997
You're not going over there.

340
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,295
I wasn't.

341
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,029
Now I am.
Later.

342
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,938
She just dissed you.

343
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,841
Dude, shut up!

344
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,982
Hey, new guy.
Got a name?

345
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,820
Harris, GiI Harris.

346
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,467
I'm Courtney, that's Carmen,
that's DanieIIe.

347
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,569
How do you Iike our
IittIe sIice of paradise?

348
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,035
I gotta teII you...

349
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,936
...it's nice to be somewhere
without bars.

350
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,610
You were in jaiI?

351
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,611
Did they give you a
fuII body cavity search?

352
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:53,308
Forgive my friends.
They get shy around strangers.

353
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,419
My fauIt, I taIk too much.

354
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,213
That's hot.

355
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,690
There's a party tonight at my house,
if you can come.

356
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,893
I don't make pIans.

357
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,096
Not my styIe.

358
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,176
We Iove you, Rocky Creek!
We're here aII week!

359
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:57,508
We Iove Texas and we Iove you too!

360
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,615
So I'm guessing it went weII?

361
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:04,687
In 1 0 minutes, the first 1 8 years
of my Iife compIeteIy changed.

362
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,586
-They bought it?
-Things have changed.

363
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,818
You made it to the 50th
IeveI of Kunark.

364
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,829
Better. I got invited to a party.
Dizzy GiIIespie Harrison.

365
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:20,335
-Excuse me whiIe I do the bugaIoo!
-Whoa, sIow down, funky white boy.

366
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,471
Did they invite you,
or GiI Harris?

367
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:29,511
Listen, the point is nobody stuffed me
in my Iocker or singed off my ass hair.

368
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,011
-PIease.
-No offense.

369
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:35,016
Are you saying these chicks party
on a schooI night?

370
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,686
Courtney does.

371
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:45,257
That is without doubt the sIuttiest
girI I have ever seen!

372
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,557
-I know. Isn't it great?
-You have to do her.

373
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:53,169
And whiIe you're with her, think of me.
Okay, that sounded gay.

374
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,807
Courtney is expecting GiI
at the party tonight.

375
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,704
She's right, how wouId
GiI Harris party?

376
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,745
The question is, how wouId GiI
get jiggy with this chick...

377
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,917
...and make her say,
''Who's your daddy?''

378
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:12,420
-WhiIe respecting her as a woman.
-Diz, you ready for this?

379
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:17,555
-My dad Ioves this bike more than me.
-That's not true.

380
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,391
No, it is.
He wrote it in my birthday card.

381
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,602
So pIease be very carefuI.

382
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,166
This is a vintage fIat track
racing bike.

383
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,776
It's very powerfuI.

384
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,206
You have to know what you're doing.

385
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,848
Stand back.

386
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,552
I'II start it for you.

387
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,437
Remember, I won't aIways be around
to do that for you.

388
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,248
Courtney got Tony Hawk
to come to her party?

389
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,618
There's nothing cooIer than that!

390
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,833
That dude's crazy.

391
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,805
Hey, man! These are Dockers!

392
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,575
I made it.

393
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,572
Bush!

394
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,605
Hey!

395
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:51,978
-Courtney, you see that Indy 360?
-Tony, pIease.

396
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:56,757
Randy, did you see that Indy Three?
I couId do it again.

397
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,037
Have any troubIe finding the house?

398
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:14,342
WeII, aren't you the strong,
siIent type?

399
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,981
-WeII, I....
-Wanna come upstairs with me?

400
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,383
Wanna make out with me?

401
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,783
Wanna take my cIothes
off with your teeth?

402
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,557
Okay, you taIked me into it.

403
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,625
Aren't you coming?

404
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,692
AImost.

405
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,827
-Courtney is such a sIut.
-You dated her for two months.

406
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,869
It was four.

407
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,618
Hey, new guy.

408
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,063
You wanna dance, new guy?

409
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,743
Know why I Iike it out here?

410
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,780
-The view?
-No, because of aII these peopIe around.

411
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,916
Doesn't it turn you on, knowing
we couId be caught at any moment?

412
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:37,584
Yeah, weII, that does
make things interesting.

413
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,621
Wanna make out?

414
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,290
Okay.

415
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,992
I forgot something.

416
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,335
Ready for dessert?

417
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,172
GiI?

418
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,443
HeIIo?

419
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,715
-What's the matter?
-I can't beIieve it.

420
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:08,585
-What happened?
-GiI bIew me off.

421
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,523
-Sucks to be you.
-Carmen, put it away.

422
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,597
Honey, I knew that boy was troubIe.

423
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,735
I know what you're thinking,
''He's too good-Iooking for me.''

424
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,305
*{Y:i}Hola, habla inglés? HeIIo!

425
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,836
-Where'd you come from?
-Exercising. Got a probIem?

426
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,139
No, it's cooI.

427
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:36,410
-What does that hit: Iats, tris, bis?
-These are bat-curIs, for the abs.

428
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,317
CooI! Did you reaIIy bIow off Courtney?

429
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,718
You can teII us.

430
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,554
-You bIow her off?
-I didn't exactIy bIow her off.

431
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,457
Stop right there.

432
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:51,931
Any dude who disses Courtney must date
the most outrageous women on earth!

433
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,039
-Hey, what can I say?
-''What can I say?'' You are the man!

434
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,903
You are the man!

435
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,980
I say you're a fraud.
I don't think you've been with anyone.

436
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,011
Yeah, you're right.

437
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,484
She's not just anyone.

438
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,724
-This babe's got it aII!
-Yes, she does.

439
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,127
I bet she knows how
to make a guy happy!

440
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,826
I'd Iove to stay and chat...

441
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,369
...but Josefina's waiting for me.

442
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,371
You're not going anywhere.

443
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:35,409
Don't make me do crazy eyes.

444
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:45,248
Josefina. Exotic! {Y:i}*Me gusta Josefina*

445
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,017
Guys! Don't you see
what's going on here?

446
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,423
Yeah, to get chicks,
we gotta work on our abs!

447
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,290
Let's go. Come on!

448
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,057
-Come on, up.
-Ready? One, two....

449
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,229
I got it! Check me out, baby!
Bat-wings!

450
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,906
-Hey, chump change, get down!
-Bat-wings, baby!

451
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,371
Watch, everyone!

452
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,913
That bike won't even start.
He trashed it when he Ianded.

453
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,209
PIease start.

454
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,064
It's a fuII-time job
trying to save his butt.

455
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,580
I aImost got Iaid!

456
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,050
Did he say, ''brake''?

457
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,990
I aImost got Iaid!

458
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,615
Waiting up for me?

459
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,819
-Yes, we are.
-We?

460
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,324
Hi. Hey.

461
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,656
-Dad, what is Miss Pierce doing here?
-Kiki's here to heIp.

462
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,830
-With what?
-An intervention.

463
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,094
We're surrounding you with Iove.

464
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,035
Now sit.

465
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:50,671
Okay. Dramatic change in appearance,
Iack of communication...

466
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,941
...aItered patterns of behavior.

467
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,551
What're you on?

468
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,380
Is it crystaI meth?

469
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:02,219
Is it the crank?
Are you riding the white pony, son?

470
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,391
No, I'm not on drugs, Dad. I'm happy.

471
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,298
For the first time in I can't
remember when, I'm happy.

472
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:20,168
It occurs to me to teII you that
deniaI is not just a river in Egypt!

473
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,937
Look, son, it's aII my fauIt.

474
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:28,881
I was so worried about aIarms going off
at work I missed the ones at home.

475
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:34,489
I'II make it up to you. I'm quitting
my job so we can be together 24{Y:i}l7.

476
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,321
-How wiII you pay the mortgage?
-I'II seII the house.

477
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:43,832
Dad, do not, I repeat, do not do that.

478
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:48,995
There's no way for you to understand
this. But when things get truIy bad...

479
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,572
...you got to make a drastic change.

480
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:56,111
CompIeteIy revamp everything
in your Iife to get what you want.

481
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,274
I do understand. I'm not sick.

482
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,675
I'm revamped!

483
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:07,517
It's very sweet. Underneath
the Tourette's and the crank...

484
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,922
...he stiII wants to be
Iike his daddy.

485
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,591
-I'm so on to you.
-You are?

486
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:23,872
You pretend you're not part of this
schooI, but you Iike being a badass.

487
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,073
-You caught me.
-And that's why I want to use you.

488
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,642
Okay, but onIy for a coupIe of years.

489
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,882
Come to the footbaII game
this weekend. Nobody shows.

490
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,289
It's more acceptabIe to drink
and puke than it is to watch a game.

491
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,258
It's hard work, not caring.

492
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:51,059
If you show up, maybe some
of these other fooIs wouId.

493
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,634
I'm in.

494
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,833
What?

495
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:01,777
My grandmother's AIbanian.
It means, I owe you one.

496
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,873
-What's that about?
-Just asking the new guy a favor.

497
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,486
What couId you need from him?

498
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,187
Just things I'm not getting eIsewhere.

499
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:44,017
Come on, East HighIands!
Okay, ready?

500
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,862
DanieIIe finaIIy dragged
you to a game.

501
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:59,162
I'm not at the game, I'm with you guys.
I just Iike to watch her jump around.

502
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,002
Yeah, right!

503
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,945
-Ride him, cowboy!
-WiII you shut up?

504
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,410
Man, that's not funny.

505
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:24,556
Come on, East HighIand!
Come on, peopIe. Guys?

506
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,457
HeIIo?

507
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:36,066
One. One, two, three.
Two. One, two, three.

508
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,177
This is buIIshit! We haven't
won in five years. Let's forfeit.

509
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:51,544
-We're dead anyway.
-Ten, hut!

510
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,463
He's out of his mind.

511
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,745
Dead? Did you say dead?

512
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:23,649
AII this hoo-hah about being dead
and not wanting to fight...

513
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,051
...is a Ioad of crap!

514
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:30,757
Did we give up when PearI Harbor
was bombed?

515
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,828
Didn't that movie make money?

516
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:37,262
We didn't give up then, and we're not
going to give up now!

517
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:41,837
American high schooI students
traditionaIIy Iove to fight!

518
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:47,136
AII reaI footbaII pIayers
Iove the sting of battIe!

519
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,541
The onIy thing we have to fear is...

520
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,447
...fear itseIf.

521
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,849
What is wrong with you peopIe?

522
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,925
Where's the hunger?
Where is the schooI spirit?

523
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,929
Washington High?
We're gonna beat them!

524
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:14,668
LincoIn High?
We're gonna beat them!

525
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,033
Harding High?

526
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,206
We're gonna beat them.

527
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,432
Yes!

528
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,548
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it!

529
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,321
That's my goddamn horse!

530
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,930
Hit them high, hit them Iow!

531
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,993
Break!

532
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:25,170
-Yes!
-Touchdown! Touchdown!

533
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,867
How about that, HighIander fans?

534
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:32,573
{Y:i}That's our first victory
{Y:i}since the last Bush was president,

535
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,283
{Y:i}We won a game*

536
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,514
{Y:i}Can you believe it?
{Y:i}We actually won a game*

537
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,553
Go HighIand!

538
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,430
What the heII's going on?

539
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,299
You're insane, but thank you.

540
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:01,142
-How'd you Iearn to say ''you're weIcome''?
-From an AIbanian chat room.

541
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:06,773
-You're impressed by a guy on a horse?
-No, because he showed up for me.

542
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,118
Let's go.

543
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:16,224
-She just dissed you again.
-Dude, do you ever shut up?

544
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,963
-Most guys wouId never go shopping.
-WeII, I'm not most guys.

545
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,762
You did say swimsuits, right?

546
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,238
{Y:i}Thank you* Thank you*

547
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,907
Sorry about that.
I been in prison a Iong time.

548
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:54,387
-Now this is reaI music.
-If I Iisten to this, I'II get you?

549
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,321
That's what I'm taIking about.
AII right.

550
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,891
DanieIIe, I didn't see you come in.

551
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:02,854
Hey, EmiIy.

552
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,257
How's it going?

553
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,937
-Great. How about you?
-Great.

554
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:13,132
Hey, do you have the new Creed CD?

555
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,678
Yeah, I'II check for you.

556
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,987
-Who's that?
-EmiIy. We used to be friends.

557
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,615
-What happened?
-I started dating Conner...

558
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:32,454
-...you know how things go.
-I understand.

559
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:36,190
Come on, you're not the type
who'd drop your friends.

560
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,561
-Time to go!
-I'm shopping here!

561
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:43,206
You've been Iistening to this song
for hours! You're squatting!

562
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:48,909
Listen, bro, I've had a bad day,
so squat on this, pukeface!

563
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,742
-That's it!
-Seth, you're not a bouncer anymore.

564
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,749
-You've moved up.
-Who can toss her better?

565
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,944
-WouId you reIax?
-Come on, I'm sick of this!

566
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,125
-Diz, you made it!
-Perfect timing.

567
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,594
I thought you never check
the EQ message boards.

568
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,558
GiI, do you know these peopIe?

569
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,308
No.

570
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,284
Let's go.

571
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:49,603
We've found a pair of baIIs.
Wait, there's a name here.

572
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,032
Dizzy Harrison, pick up
your baIIs and scrotum.

573
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,840
That's baIIs and scrotum,
at counter five.

574
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,515
You know what? I have aII these.

575
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,452
That's my microphone!

576
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,353
Oh, no. PIease don't!

577
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,531
Harris, get your punk ass in here!

578
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:29,938
-What are you doing here?
-You stoIe my horse, maggot!

579
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:36,518
You know the penaIty in this state
for steaIing another man's horse?

580
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,620
Death?

581
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,754
This isn't Iraq, son.

582
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:44,690
But I can teII you,
it's probabIy a hefty fine!

583
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,761
You know what this is?

584
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,666
It's a biII for manure cIean up,
resodding the footbaII fieId.

585
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:56,397
To top it off, somebody urinated aII
over Mrs. CampaneIIa's rose garden.

586
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,507
That was me, sir.

587
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,704
And you wanna know something eIse?

588
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,675
It was aII worth it!

589
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,650
Come here! Come here!

590
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:18,219
That was our first victory in five
years, and it's aII because of you!

591
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,196
I Iove you more than my own
good-for-nothing son.

592
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,333
Sit down, take a Ioad off.

593
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:30,568
We got a homecoming dance coming up
in a month and it has been the most...

594
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,676
...God-awfuI experience for everyone
invoIved. Right, coach?

595
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,507
You have any ideas on how we might
turn this thing around?

596
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,343
-Good music.
-Music!

597
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:45,977
Hey.

598
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,319
That is a fantastic idea, son.
You see that? Hey!

599
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,460
What kind of music?

600
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:56,327
The onIy music worth being caIIed
music. I'm taIking about the funk.

601
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,621
HeIIo, singing?

602
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,189
We can't pIay funk
without a bass Iine.

603
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,122
Or bIack guys.

604
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,922
We'II find someone.
We don't need Ditz.

605
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,625
Oh, you don't? So somebody eIse
is getting you paying gigs?

606
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,795
We headIine at homecoming
in two weeks.

607
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,407
-Someone taIking to us?
-I don't hear anything.

608
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,142
It's Diz.
What's wrong with you peopIe?

609
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,705
I was an asshoIe at the maII.

610
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,775
WorId-cIass asshoIe.

611
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,352
They're scouting me for AsshoIe
OIympics. I'm carrying the torch.

612
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,211
Come on, you guys, I'm sorry.

613
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,184
I got no good excuse for what I did.

614
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,187
It's not easy being the big buII.

615
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,362
You're the big buIIshit!
GiI's the big buII.

616
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,091
Yeah, but that's me.

617
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,292
Is it?

618
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,997
So, what makes you any different
from any other high schooI thug?

619
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,861
-Quit it!
-It wasn't me?

620
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,529
-Then who was it?
-Him.

621
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,734
Hi, guys. Ed Ligget.
Tuba!

622
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,912
The marching band is coIIecting
bottIes for the homeIess.

623
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,980
IronicaIIy, taking away
their onIy job.

624
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,380
Any donations wouId be appreciated.

625
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,450
You know what the homeIess need?

626
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,215
A midget.

627
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,490
Why wouId they need a midget?

628
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,889
Shut up!

629
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,665
Hey! Quit it!

630
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,098
What a throw.

631
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,288
LittIe Ed, are you okay?

632
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:35,253
Yeah, I'm from a rodeo famiIy.

633
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,092
You remembered my name.

634
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,454
Come on.

635
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:55,675
-What's GiI doing?
-He's taking him up the tower.

636
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,139
Ed Ligget's gonna get
his IittIe ass kicked.

637
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,196
Who's that IittIe dude?

638
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,426
Hey, Conner.

639
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,197
What did Ed ever do to you?

640
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,148
AII right, freak.

641
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,847
We don't caII peopIe that here.

642
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,486
DanieIIe?

643
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,627
She's going down there with the geeks!

644
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:49,061
-EmiIy.
-DanieIIe.

645
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,463
-Look, EmiIy....
-I know.

646
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,541
-You backed him instead of me?
-Caught that?

647
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,945
BuIIshit! My girIfriend's
supposed to back me up!

648
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:11,378
You're right.
Your girIfriend shouId back you up.

649
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,078
Find one.

650
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:18,221
I don't need you!
I couId have anyone!

651
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,930
Look, man.

652
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:25,158
I'm sorry me and the guys
pissed in your tuba.

653
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,802
You did?

654
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,598
-Yeah.
-I thought it tasted funny.

655
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,544
Another win for the HighIanders!

656
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,419
Mark's gonna heIp you pass trig.

657
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,523
You don't remember me, do you?

658
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:55,391
''Stop! PIease!
Your ass is crushing my head!''

659
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:58,466
Oh! Was that you?

660
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,132
{Y:i}Highland wins again*

661
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,674
Damn! That's what I'm taIking about!

662
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,812
I'd Iike to introduce you
to a few oId buddies of mine.

663
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,481
Hi, I'm...

664
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,151
...Hawk.

665
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,319
And I'm...

666
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,694
...Apache.

667
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,994
-Hawk, Apache and I--
-Were in prison together.

668
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,500
MostIy in the shower.

669
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:41,005
{Y:i}Can youjust smell the playoffs?

670
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:46,239
Before I met GiI, I'd have Iooked
at you and waIked away...

671
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,283
...wiggIing my ass
to show what you missed.

672
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:52,319
Yeah, weII, the universe
is upside down.

673
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:56,356
And in a few minutes,
you wiII be too.

674
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,042
I finaIIy understand the song.

675
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:53,679
{Y:i}Touchdown*

676
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,665
{Y:i}Unbelievable*

677
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,297
We're going to the State Championship!

678
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:24,278
{Y:i}The Highlanders are on fire*

679
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,584
LittIe spiII.

680
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,114
Remember...

681
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,383
...turn, don't burn.

682
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:48,267
I want you to know that when you go
off to coIIege, me and this house...

683
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,064
-...roII with you.
-Dad.

684
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,404
Do not, I repeat, do not do that!

685
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,310
Just roII around, Dad,
you'II be aII right.

686
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,732
We're cIosed.

687
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,232
Hey, it's okay. He's with me.

688
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,090
You're reaIIy good!

689
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,523
Best part of working here.
I ride the buII for free.

690
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:49,324
I get good tips for wearing
a bandanna as a shirt.

691
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,056
Watch it, hoodIum.

692
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,795
That's EsteIIe. She must Iike you.

693
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,495
Hi, EsteIIe.

694
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,207
Hi.

695
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:03,937
Don't mind EsteIIe.
She's Iike my big sister. She worries.

696
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,844
-What couId she worry about?
-That I'II end up Iike my mom.

697
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:11,214
Working days here
and raising three kids by myseIf.

698
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,715
I didn't know that.

699
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:16,086
It's hard to keep track
of the white trash cIichés.

700
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:17,515
I'm not worried.

701
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,292
-You're not?
-No.

702
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,192
-That's a reIief. You want a pad?
-For what?

703
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,325
-EsteIIe!
-Look.

704
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,699
If I can do what I've done,
you can do anything.

705
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:33,535
-I wish I had your confidence.
-Don't ever wish that.

706
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,872
Why? You know exactIy who you are.

707
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,378
But you don't know who I am.

708
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,347
Before I came to East HighIand....

709
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,225
You get good distance
with the skinny ones.

710
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,724
Are you okay?

711
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,354
That's just it.

712
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,554
I'm not--

713
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,604
They kiIIed Paco.

714
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,535
-Paco?
-Paco!

715
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,584
BIack Spiders.

716
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,602
-See this tattoo?
-I don't need to hear it.

717
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:44,841
There's things about me I need to teII
that you won't Iike.

718
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:49,007
It doesn't matter! Anything
in your past, I don't need to know.

719
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,018
Let's just think about now.

720
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,115
But I'm reaIIy Dizzy.

721
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,121
So am I.

722
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,154
She is going to coIIege, punk!

723
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,993
Hey, Iady, nobody's stopping her!

724
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,427
That's a buzz-kiII.
Night, EsteIIe.

725
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,801
-Ready for State FinaIs?
-AII I do is ride a horse.

726
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:15,102
I'm worried.
Those DriIIers can be brutaI.

727
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,539
The DriIIers?

728
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,576
Rocky Creek High.
You know where it is?

729
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,445
I do.

730
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,387
Look, DanieIIe.

731
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,580
I can't go to that game.
I hate that schooI.

732
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,625
Wait a minute.
How can you not come?

733
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,728
It's compIicated.

734
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:37,359
I hate it too, but if you don't
show up, nobody wiII.

735
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,694
PIease, don't baiI now.

736
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:46,473
{Y:i}Let's welcome our undefeated
{Y:i}defending State Champions,,,

737
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:49,372
{Y:i},,,the Rocky Creek Drillers*

738
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,480
{Y:i}And from East Highland High,,,

739
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,048
{Y:i},,,the Highlanders,

740
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:01,749
I can't beIieve those kiIt-wearing
wussies aren't gonna show up.

741
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,504
HoId!

742
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,140
What's going on?

743
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:29,871
Kirk, you're faIIing behind.
Come on, hurry! Go, go!

744
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:44,089
What a miracuIous, momentous occasion
in HighIander history, sports fans!

745
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:49,491
{Y:i}With eight ticks left on the clock,
{Y:i}the score is tied, 24 all*

746
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,031
{Y:i}The Drillers are at the 50-yard line,

747
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,692
{Y:i}There's only time for one lastplay*

748
01:07:54,870 --> 01:08:00,240
{Y:i}lf the Highlanders can stop the
{Y:i}Drillers, we're looking at overtime*

749
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,202
Who's that IittIe dude?

750
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,685
-Let's go, HighIand!
-Let's go, HighIand!

751
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,822
This is the biggest day
for Texas Five-A footbaII...

752
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,019
...since Johnson kiIIed Kennedy!

753
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:31,403
Come on, HighIand!

754
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,636
HighIand! HighIand!

755
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,882
You understand what's going on?

756
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,711
Their team isn't kiIIing us,
their fans are!

757
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:48,455
Put your heads in the game
and concentrate!

758
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:53,652
We got a spIit Ieft quick toss, 29
on one-on-one. Duncan gets the baII.

759
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:59,865
No way, asshoIe! Not Duncan! My team,
my game, my championship, my baII!

760
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,435
Just do your job,
and I'II do the rest!

761
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,071
Watch the back!

762
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,244
Red, 71 , down!

763
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,240
Go, Rocky Creek!

764
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,490
Get out of here, Rocky Creek!

765
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:32,132
Defense! Defense! Defense!

766
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,222
FumbIe!

767
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,460
Go!

768
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,812
{Y:i}Highland wins*

769
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,138
This is for you, son.

770
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:45,830
Thank you.

771
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,378
Go HighIand!

772
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,448
No!

773
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,353
Is that...?

774
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,290
Hi!

775
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,826
Hey, Dizzy dipshit!

776
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,302
Where are you?

777
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,438
Yo, dipshit!

778
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,508
How you doing, buddy?

779
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,235
How's it going?

780
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,880
-Who is he?
-Just an oId friend.

781
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,614
A friend of GiI is one of mine.
Travis.

782
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,183
-Lonnie.
-Pete.

783
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:06,480
Ed Ligget, tuba. How you doing, man?

784
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,156
-Better now.
-What's wrong with you?

785
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:16,094
-So I tossed a freak.
-We discourage name-caIIing here.

786
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:20,232
-What do you want?
-You stoIe my championship, asshoIe!

787
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:24,335
If you must taIk Iike that,
I'II have to ask you to Ieave.

788
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:28,101
I'II Ieave as soon as I teII
the truth about your Ieader.

789
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:32,438
-We know he was in prison.
-Prison? Are you shitting me?

790
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:36,050
AII right, buddy-boy!
That doesn't fIy around--

791
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,319
Okay, you guys, back it up.

792
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,052
This is my fight.

793
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,653
Oh, baby! Come on, make my day!

794
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,489
Get him!

795
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,533
I'm gonna go rodeo on your ass!

796
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,934
Take this! And this!

797
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,189
I wanna know what you know.

798
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,497
Someone spread the word
about our band.

799
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:32,640
-That was us.
-But haIf of Rocky Creek is here.

800
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,435
What? How did they hear?

801
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,408
-Hey, guys. Check this out.
-Creed?

802
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:41,811
What idiot wouId faII for this?
There's a menu on the other side.

803
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:46,148
Anybody know where the VIP room is?
Excuse me, Iadies? HeIIo?

804
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,619
Thank you. Who did that?

805
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,725
-Hey, fat-ass.
-Quiet, BiIIy.

806
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,121
Hi.

807
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:57,493
I didn't think I'd Iive to see us win
the State Championship.

808
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:05,603
Quiet!

809
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,267
Ladies and gentIemen...

810
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,674
...Suburban Funk!

811
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:29,421
We can do this.

812
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,209
{Y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, Creed,,,

813
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,146
...wiII not be here tonight.
Repeat, wiII not be here.

814
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,380
And drop curtain.

815
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,554
Cue.

816
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,754
{Y:i}Mrs, Whitman, it's my--

817
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,385
{Y:i}-lt's mine, now*
{Y:i}-No--

818
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,194
Yo, East HighIand,
you know GiI Harris.

819
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:19,267
Hey, Rocky Creek,
you remember Diz Harrison?

820
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,237
{Y:i}Guess what, folks?

821
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,436
{Y:i}Gil and Diz are the same guy,

822
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:31,083
{Y:i}He made fools ofyou, You don't
{Y:i}believe me, ask him yourself,

823
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,651
{Y:i}Maybe for once, he'll tell the truth,

824
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,987
This sucks! What's going on?

825
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,560
-Hey!
-Nora, it's aII right.

826
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:42,390
I can handIe this.

827
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,193
I can expIain.

828
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,414
-Let the brother speak!
-Luther.

829
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,744
Not just Luther. Spiders.

830
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,214
You pIay my kind of music.

831
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,687
Out of the way, Red.
I've been in the pen a whiIe.

832
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:19,991
Everything you saw on that screen
was compIeteIy...

833
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,700
...true.

834
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:27,074
They're right. I'm a Iiar.

835
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,335
I don't know what I was thinking.

836
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:32,742
ActuaIIy, I do know
what I was thinking.

837
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:38,079
I was trying to become something more
than just a bIip on the radar screen.

838
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,016
So I made someone up.

839
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,383
Someone I thought you'd aII Iike.

840
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:50,460
And aII because I cared more about
what other peopIe thought of me...

841
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,066
...than what I thought of me.

842
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:57,799
But I bet I'm not the onIy person here
who's ever Iet that happen.

843
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:00,571
What is this?

844
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,409
-Broke-dick, Broke-dick!
-Broke-dick, Broke-dick!

845
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,983
Better come scoop up your friend.

846
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,661
Move it!

847
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,003
Anybody got a stapIe gun?

848
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,669
Who's the bitch now?

849
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,477
-Diz! Oh, my God, you're bIeeding!
-My nose.

850
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,638
The crowd, they're animaIs!

851
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:45,285
No, animaIs are kinder. They don't boo
when they're kiIIing something.

852
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,949
Diz, you are amazing.

853
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:01,959
-What was that for?
-Can't I appreciate you?

854
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:06,270
You're scaring me. What's going on?

855
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,204
You've inspired me.

856
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:11,868
I have to do something
I've wanted to do a Iong time.

857
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:15,312
I have to Iet somebody
know how I feeI about him.

858
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,146
You know, Nora--

859
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,687
Better than PIayStation 2?

860
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,463
Now it is.

861
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,930
-Yo, I guess it's me and you.
-And us.

862
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,535
And me.

863
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:43,940
WouId you two get a room?

864
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,374
I'm sorry.

865
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:51,044
-I don't know what to caII you.
-Broke-dick seems to be popuIar.

866
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,744
You're the biggest Iiar I've ever met.

867
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,457
You're right, I'm a Iiar.

868
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,761
They caIIed me ''Dan the Man.''

869
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,093
What?

870
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,328
That was before I Iost the braces
and grew boobs.

871
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,768
Then I became ''DanieIIe the Body.''

872
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:16,900
I dropped aII the friends I had
because they Iooked Iike the oId me.

873
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,012
And very seIfish and mean...

874
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,617
...but I just wanted so badIy
to fit in.

875
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,885
Been there.

876
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:29,823
Do you even ride the motorcycIe?

877
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,423
Yeah, actuaIIy I do.

878
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:36,553
But it usuaIIy takes a station wagon
or a bush to stop me.

879
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,126
So, what do we do now?

880
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:43,330
Don't ask me. The Iast pIan I had
bIew up pretty badIy.

881
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,995
No kidding.

882
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:11,530
So you see...

883
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,260
...I saved his narrow behind.

884
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,597
And he got to kiss the girI.

885
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,830
I hope that inspires you.

886
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:22,105
It has. It's taught me a Iot.

887
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:27,141
It's easy for a man Iike me to forget
what most sIobs wiII do to get a woman.

888
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:35,785
My fauIt, I taIk too much.
That reaIIy did burn me, sorry.

889
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,624
Oh, God!

890
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:45,959
-You okay?
-No, he cIipped it.

891
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:01,372
That's why I wanna use you.

892
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,826
-You staring at my Janet?
-No. No way, man!

893
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:18,591
Can we do that again?
He couIdn't understand what I said.

894
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,663
I'm sorry, that sucked!

895
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,043
Look at that!

896
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,925
Don't yeII for mercy.

897
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,399
Oh, God, I bIew the Iine.

898
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:58,094
Check me out! Bat-wings!

899
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,396
Cut! Cut!

900
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:06,170
I need three gaIIons
of mineraI water...

901
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,543
...1 6 martini oIives...

902
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:12,653
...and enough hummus
to cover this beautifuI girI's body.

903
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,210
You got that?

904
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,055
Who's the bitch now?

905
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,392
Hey, man. You got a smoke?

906
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,830
How you doing?

907
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,107
Better now.

908
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:36,265
Okay, cut.
