1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,378
-In 1621, pilgrims took a break
from burning witches

2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,423
to attend the first Thanksgiving feast.

3
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,009
Uninvited, obviously.

4
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,803
Read the room, fucking puritans.

5
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,889
After hundreds of years, this national holiday

6
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,559
of wasting a weekend with people you literally just can't with

7
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,436
has been a well-documented
American tradition.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,314
But our generation -- technically I'm Gen Z,

9
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,525
but I self-identify as a Millennial --

10
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,401
is breaking off with the separatist movement

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:15,618
known as Friendsgiving, which is why I'm here.

12
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,536
My name is Frances Sharp. I'm a documentarian.

13
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,413
I'm criticized as a narcissist
with a compulsion

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,165
to document everything.

15
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,250
Everyone yells at me to

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,460
"cut the fucking camera, Fran."

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,838
-You just have to give it to her, and then if you do,

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,465
she'll leave you alone
eventually.

19
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,844
-Some people have therapy dogs.

20
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:36,553
I have my iPhone.

21
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,640
This Thanksgiving, I'm putting myself in front of the camera

22
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,559
with my best friend, Parker.

23
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,603
And her weird-assMormon boyfriend

24
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,146
at his butt-fuck-nowhere cabin.

25
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,273
-Yeah. Okay.

26
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,651
Okay. No. Got to go.

27
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,276
Losing service. Okay.

28
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,657
Ew. Dude, just hit your JUUL
like a normal person.

29
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,078
<i>-No Inglés.

30
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,540
-Wait. Dude, since when did you
start smoking?

31
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:08,085
-Since... -Don't say Atticus.

32
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,003
-I invited my fuck-buddy,
Atticus,

33
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,089
to Friendsgiving dinner tonight.

34
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,966
Parker doesn't know.

35
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,133
-Really?

36
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,678
-Speaking of Atticus...

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,763
Parker doesn't like Atticus.

38
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,557
-I fucking hate Atticus.

39
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,849
-Oh, my gosh.

40
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,146
Dude, I just hate that his music is so good!

41
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,690

-Hmm. I'm good.

47
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,619

48
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,122
-Whatever.

49
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,249
-I'm an educator at an elite
boarding school.

50
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,126

-It'll be nice to, like, not have service for a while.

76
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,817
-Yeah, I have friends in Idaho.

77
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,987
They go to Starbucksfor their WiFi, and it...

78
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,823
Really cool. I don't hear from them very often.

79
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:07,286
-Wait. Have you been recording us this whole time?

80
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,458
-Duh.-Typical.

81
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,211
-Oh, look at the swings.

82
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,046
-Oh, my God, wait,
they're so cute.

83
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,049
-Okay, I'm literally screaming.
-I'm so excited!

84
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,803
-Okay.

85
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,789
Remember when I broke my teeth
on that rope swing?

86
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,418
-You also broke your back.

87
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,129
-Less important.

88
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,214
-Okay, you're --you're stressing me out.

89
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,382
Just get on the swing.

90
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,509
-Only because I want to.

91
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,385
Not because you're telling me.

92
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,640
-Just get on.

93
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,189
Okay.So, I'm gonna be cheesy.

94
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:16,898
I don't know.

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,277
I just feel like we've disconnected a lot

96
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,153
in the last few years

97
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,738
and just because of life or whatever.

98
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,616
And I know I've changed a lot
and you've, um --

99
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,076
well, you're you.

100
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,287
I just feel like this weekend's
a perfect time to, like,

101
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:36,334
reconnect, and I don't know,
I just feel so blessed.

102
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,798
-Don't be bolder.
-Never.

103
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,511
-Is that John David?

104
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,972
-Yes, actually,it's John Dallas,

105
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,974
and I think he's the one.

106
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,018
- Ah! -

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,563
-Nice. Excited to meet him.

108
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,024
-Is that a tattoo?
-You're judging.

109
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,276
-I mean, I'm only judgingthat you didn't tell me.

110
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,235
-I didn't want to tell you

111
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,528
because you'd judge me out of it.

112
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,947
-I mean, I'm sorry, but who did that shit?

113
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,282
It looks hideous.

114
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,327
-So, Atticus...-Are you serious?

115
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,745
-Sorry I'm reclaiming
my own body.

116
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,872
-Okay, with a prison tat? -'Cause I was feeling

117
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,166
all weird about getting
chlamydia.

118
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:16,875
-From Atticus.

119
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,753
So you're reclaiming your own
body from Atticus Vincent

120
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,589
by getting a tattoo by Atticus Vincent.

121
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,633
-We've been hooking up for,
like, five years now,

122
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,886
and she still hasn't met him,
but I swear he's nice

123
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,348
and, like, repressed,
progressive, hot.

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,724
I mean, he was talking so much

125
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,976
about beingin an open relationship.

126
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,604
-Frances literally thought
they were actually

127
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,437
in an open relationship.

128
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,191
-Then he moved in with his girlfriend, Hannah Jack-off

129
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,567
or Jackson or whatever the fuck.

130
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,280
She still refuses to meet me because I'm "the other woman."

131
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,698
-No, no air quotes.

132
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,326
You're literally that.

133
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,619
-Okay. It's a radio.

134
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,039
I'm tuning in to my new self
or something.

135
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,751
Whatever. It made sense when I was getting it.

136
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,504
My mom was gonna throw me off a roof.

137
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,922
-I mean...

138
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,756
It is kind of cool.

139
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,302
Like something your cousin Melwould get at rehab or something.

140
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,971
-Oh, shit.

141
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:15,642
-What? What did you do, Fran?

142
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,643
What did you do?

143
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,603
-Basically, I like literally
actively exploit

144
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,188
my family for my films. Last Thanksgiving,

145
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,442
I captured the underlying darkness of American culture.

146
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,362
Mainly my family being hypocritical dicks.

147
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,113
Aunts on Xanax.

148
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:32,452
My woke father, who hasn't
paid a tax since '89.

149
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,412
My cousin Mel'sheroin addiction.

150
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,997
Big crowd-pleaser.

151
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,039
-Fran.

152
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,833
-So, I was feeling really bad

153
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,837
about getting us both kicked out of Thanksgiving this year.

154
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,132
-Turn your video off.

155
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,425
Off.

156
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,718
-As a result of my truth telling,

157
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,471
I'm technically not allowed back
at Grandma's house.

158
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,350
-And?

159
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,603
Fran.

160
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,604
-Oh, my God. Thanks so much.

161
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:04,566
Tell your daughter to call me any time she's ready, okay?

162
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,777
Thanks. Stay safe and stay sexy. Bye!

163
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,533
-You know it's, like, her thing to invite herself everywhere.

164
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,994
-I don't have time
to yell at you.

165
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,583
Just get your fucking turkey.

166
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:26,340
-Okay. But this turkey is going to be<i>fuego.

167
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,900
-Oh, my God. Hi, you guys!

168
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,070
-Mel, where have you been, girl?
-Grad school.

169
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,155
That's what I call my outpatient rehab.

170
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:57,327
Oh, my God, bro. Did you seethere's a literal fucking river?

171
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,580
Yeah, my sponsor told me that
if I came the mountains,

172
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,207
I'd probably get high.

173
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,044
Or maybe that was my horoscope.

174
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,434
-Wow, dude, I have not seen you like a guy like this before.

175
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,477
-Love, dude.

176
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,146
And I'm pretty surehe's gonna propose soon.

177
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,607
-Ew. Why? -Well, because I told him to.

178
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:32,028
-Ew, dude. Why? Do you want to be, like, a child bride?

179
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,822
-Fuck off. -Two-cow dowry.

180
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,534
-Okay, our moms had us when they were both 24.

181
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:40,412
-They're fucking miserable.
-No.<i>My</i>mom is miserable.</i>

182
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,623
Your mom's, like, the happiest
woman I know.

183
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,709
-Except when it comes to me.

184
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,794
-Solution -- maybe you should just stop

185
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:52,007
making films that exploit literally everyone you know?

186
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,592
-Mel isn't allowed
to family events

187
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,176
until she's, like, a year sober.

188
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,345
-Three months clean,
you bitch fuck.

189
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,598
-That's amazing! -Wow! Wow, Mel.

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,099
-Don't fucking patronize me like that.

191
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,185
And what the hell are you two
doing with<i>your</i>lives</i>

192
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,311
that's any better?

193
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,187
-I want to be a mom.

194
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,066
-And I want to be takenseriously as a filmmaker

195
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,276
by my mom.

196
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,743
- I am your only sibling.

197
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,830
-Noooo!

198
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,709
It's show time!

199
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,251
-Oh.

200
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,922
-I'm Frances Sharp, and you'rewatching Thanksgiving food porn.

201
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,509
-Oh!

202
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,260
Ew!

203
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,679
-Silly me. How could I have started cooking without...

204
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:44,562
-Oh, guys, I almost forgot. Look what I brought for you!

205
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,606
-Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

206
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,439
-Nope. No, no, no, nope.

207
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:54,444
I kind of have a weird relationship with, like, food.

208
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,361
Nope. No, no, no, nope.

209
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,574
Is it gonna ruin our appetite?
Absolutely not.

210
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:02,994
Especially sugar. It's like a control thing.

211
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,081
-Okay. I guess nothing's changed
since high school.

212
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,250
-She tried so hard to be bulimic
in high school,

213
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,628
but she couldnever actually throw up.

214
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,840
- Yeah, that bitch would be in the bathroom, like.

215
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,137
-I just can't with Mel.

216
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,431
- Don't start.

217
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,767
And Mel, how did you
even get here?

218
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,476
-Uber, bitch.

219
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,394
-What the fuck? What was that, like...?

220
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,731
-I'm still signed up to my
ex-daddy's account.

221
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,316
He's hella mad about it.

222
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,193
Whatever. I told him to suck a fat cock,

223
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,487
then I asked his brother
for a dick pic.

224
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,533
Oh, my God, you guys,take a look at this big,

225
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:42,909
juicy fucking monster cock.

226
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,620
-Ew! -The fuck?

227
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,664
How do you have service?
-Mm-mm.

228
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,583
-Do you have Verizon?
-Yeah.

229
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,960
-So I. What the shit?

230
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,094
-Can you at leastuse your thumbs?

231
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,556
She never uses her thumbs.
She just, like, shovels

232
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:06,808
shit around with her, like, avocado paws.

233
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,519
It's disgusting.

234
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,394
-I need a wine opener.

235
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,773
-Well, good luck finding onebecause his parents don't drink.

236
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,192
-Two years ago, she asked me
if she was an alcoholic.

237
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,986
-♪ ...like it so, you know I like to drink ♪

238
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,029
♪ Listen to me sing, rapper, you know I got the bling ♪

239
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,449
-And I told her it's fine aslong as she stops after college.

240
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,621
Then last week, she FaceTimed me, so drunk,

241
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,414
and told meshe did too much cocaine

242
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,626
and clogged the toilet
at a party.

243
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,380
-What the fuck?Are they actually Mormon?

244
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,882
-He's, like, culturally Mormon.

245
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,927
-What does that even mean?
Is he, like, a virgin?

246
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,353
Wait.

247
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,276
You guys haven't had sex yet?

248
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,739
Ew, dude, that's hella creepy.

249
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:04,866
You've been dating for like six months,

250
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,492
and you're a nympho.

251
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,745
-I'm a nympho!

252
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,622
I'm a nympho! I'm a nym--

253
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,330
-No, I'm not.

254
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,543
-You literally fucked a homeless dude in a one-night stand.

255
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,923
-Dude, that was you.

256
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,424
Yeah. -Still, though.

257
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,553
-Whatever. Well, JD doesn't drink anyway.

258
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,554
-Oh, yeah. He's in recovery.

259
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,599
You're not supposed to fuck in your first year of sobriety.

260
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,600
-No, he's not an alcoholic.

261
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:33,646
He just chooses not to partake
in premarital sex.

262
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,188
-Oof! Big yikes.

263
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,189
I'm a big catchphrase girl.

264
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,151
Right now, it's "oof" and "big yikes." People love that.

265
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,695
Ay-yi-yi! -Don't.

266
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,154
-Ew! Is that, like...

267
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,199
Is that racist? -Why would you ask me?

268
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,075
-Because you're Mexican.

269
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,704
-Frances, you can't say shit like that!

270
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,454
-Not an insult.

271
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,583
-In this climate, that's also my catchphrase.

272
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,835
-So how the fuckam I supposed to open up

273
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,753
all the wine I brought?

274
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:01,548
-I don't know. Not my problem,because I'm not drinking either.

275
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,093
-Said the girl that once smuggled blow<i>into</i>Mexico.</i>

276
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:09,472
-...fucking shot of fucking 100 proof!

277
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,101
You fucking shit-head! Aah!

278
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:13,644
Whatever.

279
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,521
I'm sure you're gonna forgive me because you're gonna

280
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,649
totally hit it offwith his best friend, Mackenzie.

281
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:21,150
-Oh. What's he like?

282
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,711
-All right, so I was on my mission, before med school.

283
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:40,253
-This fool was knocking on my door,

284
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,296
trying to tell me about Jesus.

285
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,717
-He was like, "Bro, I got something better than Jesus."

286
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,718
-Bro, I look like a peacock.

287
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,636
-Bro, you<i>do</i>look like
a peacock.</i>

288
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,680
Jump off or something.

289
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,727
-Yo, JD, your neighbors
are awesome!

290
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,729
-He was right. I quit my mission.

291
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:57,688
-I quit my job at Space X.

292
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,817
-And we've been punching each other in the face ever since.

293
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:10,701
Mac, do you mind handing me
that box right there?

294
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,369
-JD, this is Frances.

295
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,412
-Hi. How are you?

296
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,040
-He's just, like,so thoughtful and sweet.

297
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,625
-What the fuck? You're so hot.

298
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:23,965
Oh, my God. My horoscope is literally happening right now.

299
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:30,723
-Hi. It's so nice to see you.
-So good.

300
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,017
-I feel like it'd be less weird

301
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,603
if they just had sex
in front of us.

302
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,354
-You say that, and then it happens,

303
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,316
and it's, like, kind of awkward.

304
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,485
-JD. Oh, my God! JD!

305
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,444
JD!

306
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,905
-Whoa! Leave him!
-Ow!

307
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,989
-Parker, seriously, let him just stay.

308
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,242
He'll stop in 3, 2, 1.

309
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,245
-What was that?
-Bro.

310
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,498
That was a long one.

311
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
-What the hell?

312
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:02,418
-Babe, are you okay? -No, I'm not fucking okay.

313
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,379
Fine. -He does that, like, every time

314
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,298
we punch each other
in cold water.

315
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,677
-Do -- Do you guys
do that often?

316
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,220
-Mm. Kind of.

317
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,099
We're looking to buy an RV together soon.

318
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,142
-Can you guys do thatliterally anywhere else?

319
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,435
-It's okay. -No, it's not okay.

320
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,354
It's where we're making dinner.
-It's just food.

321
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,940
-No, it's not just food.
It's dinner.

322
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:26,027
And it means so much to me.

323
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,867
-Put some ice on it. I'm going for a run.

324
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,244
-Are you kidding me?

325
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,672
-Food porn.

326
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,132
That's hot.

327
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:49,842
Cut.

328
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,010
-Okay. That's enough.You're stressing me out.

329
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,514
Go wash your raw turkey hands.
That's disgusting.

330
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,644
And also, like, what time is it?

331
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,396
Why do you look constipated?

332
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:07,526
-She knows that I look constipated when I'm guilty.

333
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,485
Forgot my magnesium.
-No, you didn't.

334
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:14,492
I saw you spent all your unemployment on supplements.

335
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,242
-I invited Atticus.
-Dude!

336
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,953
-On accident! -What the fuck?

337
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:18,871
That's so fucking rude!

338
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,080
-Oh, my God. Stop screaming.
-No, I-I can't --

339
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,834
I can't handle any more --your inability to set boundaries

340
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,919
and fucks with everyone else's plans.

341
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,378
It's so fucking rude.

342
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,298
-Well, I can't helpthat Mel invited herself.

343
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,968
-I get Mel.That's on brand for her.

344
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,845
But some asshole you're
not even dating?

345
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,598
-Pretty on brand for me,
to be honest.

346
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,183
- Fucking Fran, man.

347
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,685
Ugh!

349
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,832
<i>-What do you want</i> <i>to be reminded about?</i>

350
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,765
-God! Fuck camping.

351
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,975
Ohhh, my God!

352
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,936
Ugh!

353
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,854
Fuck me!

354
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:30,110
Unh!

355
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,698
Breathe.

356
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,868
-Ew, could you, like, open a window or something?

357
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,956
Be, like, a little more respectful of my sobriety.

358
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,126
Thanks.

359
00:18:55,928 --> 00:19:00,138
LOL at<i>you</i>being the high one
at Thanksgiving now.</i>

360
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,808
-That's different.
-Is it, though?

361
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,227
-You literally overdosed
at Grandma's.

362
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,104
-And?

363
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:10,150
-And shut up. I'm meditating.

364
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,610
-Is she always like this?

365
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,696
-Well, now that I'm sober and my mental faculties

366
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:20,283
are heightened, I can see that she probably has a problem.

367
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,952
-With drugs?

368
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,829
-Yeah. And dudes.

369
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,288
Mostly just one, though.

370
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,249
Oh, my God. Your little baby cut.

371
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,879
Let me help you with that.

00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,431
Are you okay with a hug?

379
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,144
-Sure. -Great.

380
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,272
Oh, this is my partner, Hannah.

381
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:36,026
-Thank you so muchfor letting me join last minute.

382
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:39,237
-I tried Frances. I couldn't get a hold of her for some reason.

383
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,783
-Shitty service.-Oh, man. Is that still a thing?

384
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:43,867
-I'm sure you already have one,

385
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,327
but I thought it wouldn't hurt
to have another turkey.

386
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,454
-And she made amazing veggies
'cause, you know, we're,

387
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,082
like, kind of vegan,
kind of not.

388
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:51,083
-But this is a real turkey.

389
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,416
-And that's the "kind of not" party.

390
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,419
-Just have to pop it in the oven a little before.

391
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,088
-Oh, great.

392
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,177
Well, I actually think Fran
already brought a turkey.

393
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,804
But this is amazing. So thank you so much.

394
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,806
-Oh, and I brought some stuff to make a charcuterie board.

395
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:08,141
We're pretty well-known for this at dinner parties.

396
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,351
-Great. Let me help carry that.
-Yep.

397
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,979
Oh, and cases and casesof some of the best wine

398
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,232
from my father's -- Oh, man. All right.

399
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,276
What screams privilege more than
drinking Daddy's wine?

400
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,361
Literally nothing.

401
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:25,534
-Just kidding. No privilege shaming here.

402
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:26,952

-Um, just come in. Yeah.
-Hi.

424
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,400
-So weird that she
invited herself.

425
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,613
-All right, first things first.
How can I help you?

426
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:48,909
Oh, that salad is absolutely gorgeous.

427
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,744
-Right?-Oh, the colors.

428
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:51,703
The colors are incredible.

429
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,123
And these decorations are so creative with little leaves.

430
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,625
Did you make those?

431
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,544
-Wow. Um, you're here.

432
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,170
-I'm here.

433
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,297
-Let's watch some game-day
football, baby.

434
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,802
Did you guys know I used to be a cheerleader?

435
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,851
-Oh, my --

436
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,353
-I think the most unattractive
thing a person could do

437
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,146
is a spontaneous backflip.

438
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,234
-Literally, don't tell.
-Sneaky girl.

439
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,069
You so sneaky!

440
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,030
-I, like, think that Fran's
the real asshole here.

441
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:27,989
You're, like, awesome.

442
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,408
-Oh, Fran's a sweetie,
you're a sweetie.

443
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,828
I'm just happy to be here.

444
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,831
-So, um...

445
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,124
can I get you something
to drink?

446
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:42,921
-Oh. Sure. Actually, that would be great.

447
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,839
-You know what's funny?

448
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,842
I literally hated you, like, 10 minutes ago.

449
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,260
-That's quite fair.

450
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,011
-And now you've gotten me
to drink?

451
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,430
-I wasn't taking no
for an answer.

452
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:56,059
But, uh, like, you know, like, no means no.

453
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,644
-No, yeah, yeah. Totally.
Totally.

454
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,229
-I'm gonna go get that big Brie.

455
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,650
-Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

456
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,194
-Wine? -Red, please.

457
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:06,736
-Okay.

458
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:10,073
-So, do you send dick pics? Because I bet that cock is...

459
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,576
-This is music to my fucking ears.

460
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:13,410
-Wait, do you hear that?

461
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:16,955
Is that Frances I hear, walking on her toes again?

462
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,999
All right, so the trick toreally doing a Franny impression

463
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:23,211
is you have to talk like this with

464
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,921
zero subtlety.

465
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,047
-It's like you're tortured

466
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,341
in, like, some weird way or whatever.

467
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,844
-Aren't you guys, like, a married old fucking couple.

468
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,514
-Actually, I was just showing
him my Pinterest board.

469
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,559
-Ew, dude, what is with this wedding shit all of a sudden?

470
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,561
-I mean, I think the pictures
are, like, interesting

471
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:42,397
and beautiful in, like,a modern, grotesque way.

472
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,732
-You don't even believe
in marriage.

473
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,317
-I don't believe in having
biological children

474
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,776
'cause the world's fucked up
enough as it is,

475
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:51,197
but Hannah and I -- we've been looking at houses.

476
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:56,703
-What? You always say you don't believe in marriage.

477
00:25:57,265 --> 00:26:00,183
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

478
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,935
-I'm gutting a fish.
-Why?!

479
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,478
-Are you, like, all into fish rights?

480
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
-No. Why are you doing it
in my kitchen?

481
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,856
-Don't worry, I'm gonna grill this up

482
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,859
with the rest of the meat --
it's gonna be so good.

483
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,153
-It smells like fucking fish.

484
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,781
Ugh!

485
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,493
God.

486
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,869
-I thought you weren't
drinking tonight.

487
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,997
-I'm not. This is for you.

488
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,373
Now help me bring this stuff inside.

489
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,085
-Only because I want to. Not because you're telling me.

490
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,462
-Also, I'm really sorry
about Atticus.

491
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,296
I, like, understand now.

492
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,426
He's, like, kind of cool, attentive, whatever.

493
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,343
I still have one problem.

00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,379
-Great. How long is it gonna take?

523
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:58,220
I actually might hate games
more than Frances.

524
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,517
-All right, it says, "Kiss the nearest consenting adult."

525
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,393
Easy. Babe, can I kiss you?

526
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,562
-Yeah, of course.

527
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,565
-Dude, why can't JD not just be like that?

528
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:16,905
Well, minus the whole, like,open part. I'd fucking kill him.

529
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:25,078
-"Name three controversial mascots."

530
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,167
What the fuck?I literally hate sports.

531
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,630
-I'll go. Um...

532
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:39,427
Oh. "Educate yourself. Vote."

533
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,933
-"Boycott..." What's cultural appropriation?

534
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:51,312
-All right. For example, we had to stop going to hip-hop yoga.

535
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,981
It got to be a little problematic.

536
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:56,694
- You're literally
a white rapper.

537
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:57,443
-Technically...

538
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,196
All right, so, my mother's family -- they're from here.

539
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,949
Northern Italy, so, like,basically Germany, right?

540
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,868
But my father's family
were from here,

541
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,248
the southernmost tip of Sicily,
so basically Africa.

542
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,124
-Okay. Fucking murder me.

543
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,209
-So, I mean, you know, technically, in this climate --

544
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:16,547
-Are you fucking kidding me?
That's my catchphrase.

545
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,882
-I don't know about that. I say it a lot around Franny.

546
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,093
You probably stole it from her,who definitely stole it from me.

547
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,345
-That guy's fucking dead to me.

548
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:28,603
-Um, absolutely fucking not,
Atticus.

549
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,689
-This one just says to Venmo a Mexican.

550
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,691
-- I'm so dead.

551
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:37,901
-What the fuck?

552
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,570
Are you kidding?

553
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,746
-Yeah! Let's go!

554
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:49,747
-Look, babe.

555
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:50,872
-Why are you holding roadkill?

556
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:55,460
-Mac and I set thesesnares earlier, and they worked.

557
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,046
-This is, like, my only outfit.

558
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,297
-I highly, highly doubt that.

559
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,507
-That disgusting. No, you're not.

560
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,841
The menu is set. -Let's get out of here.

561
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,843
-I'm on a hunter-gatherer diet,
baby.

562
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,970
-Since when? -Uh, since always.

563
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,724
In the mountains. Come on.
-Let's go, bro!

564
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,147
-Oh. Sorry.

565
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,067
-It's okay. They're not even prescription.

566
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:24,782
-Who the fuck is that?

567
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,868
-No idea.

568
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,620
-Best popper. -Hey. Nice work, grill.

569
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:33,289
-Nicely done. Wait. Let me cut it.

570
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,209
<i>-I'm sorry, who is this?</i> -Oh, God. Oof. JD!</i>

571
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:37,836
<i>-Is JD there?

572
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:39,755
-JD.

573
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:43,341
-No. -No, it's your mom.

574
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,009
Take it.

575
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:48,557
Please. -Yeah?

576
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:54,269
Mom. I told you I was having friends over today.

577
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,772
Me and Mac and Parker.

578
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:58,022
-Oh! Oh. -Ew!

579
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:58,857
-We're just hanging out.

580
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,526
-He's just, like, so thoughtful
and sweet.

581
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:04,863
<i>-Your father and I are having
</i> <i>Thanksgiving with...</i>

582
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,075
-Mom. Mom.

583
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,121
- JD!- Nice!

584
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,876
-Come on, here.

585
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:22,508
-Fucking finally. You're here.

586
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,229
I think this is it.

587
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:41,107
I think -- I think this is
the perfect time to have,

588
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:46,154
like, an open and honest conversation with each other.

589
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,906
The three of us.

590
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,912
-Whoo! -Yeah!

591
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,559
-I have -- I have to go
to the bathroom.

592
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:00,478
-Fuck!

593
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,648
Why are you that?

594
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,994
-I'm starting to feel like I'm in a throuple.

595
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,747
-Don't be the other girl.

596
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,961
-Where is the turkey, Frances?

597
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:28,381
Where's the turkey, Frances?

598
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,801
-It's in the oven.

599
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,227
I mean that I was going to.

600
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:44,272
-But then she got high.

601
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,941
-Oh!

602
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,609
-Oh. Oh, my God. -Oh, my God!

603
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:51,237
-Oh, my God.Everybody stop screaming.

604
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,365
It's fine. Shut up.
Shut up and...

605
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,074
-Ew!

606
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,536
-This is just sofucking typical.

607
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,162
Oh, no, I got it. Thanks.
-Yeah.

608
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,289
-Are you gonna have enough time
to cook it because --

609
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,668
-Yeah, I will. Yeah. This is part of the recipe.

610
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,294
Okay. Actually, um...

611
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:10,383
-Yeah. -Actually, I just need to...

612
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:20,561
-No way, bro. They made you
fight your own food?

613
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,023
-Hi. -Hi.

614
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:27,566
-Hi.

615
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:30,443
-So, are you, like high
all the time?

616
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:31,862
-I don't know, actually.

617
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,530
-That's such a dope way to live.

618
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:36,282
-Did I tell you Mac and I are getting an RV?

619
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,576
-No.

620
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,285
-You sure you don't want to hit this blunt?

621
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,581
-I mean, I really want to,
but I probably shouldn't.

622
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,083
-Oh, come on.
-Maybe.

623
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,336
-Okay. -I'm getting high for sure.

624
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,254
-You don't like drugs
or alcohol?

625
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,840
-No, the issue is more
that I love

626
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:55,052
drugs and alcohol more than anything.

627
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:57,554
-I feel like I should
go help her.

628
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:02,559
-No, come on. No, come on. Let's go -- Let's go over here.

629
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,394
- So, yeah,
the food porn.

630
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,480
We're doing something a littlebit different this Thanksgiving.

631
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:12,819
We're just gonna, um -- You're just gonna take the turkey.

632
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:17,406
Yeah. Nice and tight.
Tender.

633
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:23,331
Just a cup of water, just to make sure it's nice and juicy.

634
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,799
Just turn it on.

635
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,553
Voila.

636
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:39,220
-I'm sure it's gonna be great.

637
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:42,181
-No, it's gonna be shit.
-No, no.

638
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,432
-No, yeah. No, it is.

639
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,852
- How about a game
of billiards, old sports?

640
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,312
All right, we can play three ways.

641
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:51,234
Cutthroat. I'll break.

642
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:57,030
-Okay. I guess we're doing that.

643
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,454
Okay. There we go.

644
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:16,174
-You want to, um --You want to hit the ball.

645
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,686
-So, I've been thinking about
the future a lot lately.

646
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,021
-Yeah?

647
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:31,355
What do you see?
-Changes.

648
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:35,611
You know, trying to grow things
for the long term.

649
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:37,946
-Like you and I?

650
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:38,739
-Like this deck.

651
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:41,867
I feel like it's in need ofsome repairs, and in the kitchen

652
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:46,079
and all kinds of stuff
with the house.

653
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,540
-Clear it up a bit more.

654
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,837
Atticus.

655
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,922
-So you're talking about renovations?

656
00:36:55,924 --> 00:37:00,052
-Yeah. What are -- What are you talking about?

657
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,762
-Renovations.

658
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:10,896
-Close.

659
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:15,276
-We're gonna be here all night
at this rate.

660
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:19,613
Yes.

661
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:28,080
-Hey. Also, Parker Salcedo?
-Yeah?

662
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,999
-Will you sleep in the tent
with me tonight?

663
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,834
-Why?

664
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:34,418
-See those stars?

665
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,461
-It's still light out.

666
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:38,464
-Yeah, but we cansleep under them.

667
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,341
-Kind of to the right.

668
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,135
-Yeah. To the -- To the right?

669
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,345
-I actually taught him that.
-Are you sure?

670
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:46,264
You sure I didn'tlearn it from...?

671
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,599
-No, I'm sure. Remember?

672
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,351
We played all the time
with my parents.

673
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:54,191
-Your parents.-My parents love Atticus.

674
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,112
-Parents tend to love me
in general.

675
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,738
-Hey, and honestly, thank you

676
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,657
for all the work you put in here today.

677
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:08,245
I feel like you made this whole
thing feel like a home.

678
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,498
"A" for effort.

679
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:20,423
-Come take a hit, fam.Feels fucking good to let it go.

680
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:29,182
-Just hit it really hard. Something's bound to go in.

681
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:31,560
-You know at least something went in.

682
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,228
-Yeah.

683
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:44,906
-But I actually do want to try
some of those poppers.

684
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,576
Ah! Too hot. Too fucking hot.
Unh-unh.

685
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:51,079
-Sorry.-It's all right.

686
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,081
-Do you like downers?

687
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:56,459
-Okay, marry me?

688
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,295
-So gamey.

689
00:38:58,297 --> 00:38:59,921
I love it.

690
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,256
Mmm.

691
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:09,890
-Shit.

692
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:11,224
-It's not the...-Nice. No, that was good.

693
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,935
-...best one, but, I mean,
I've done it it better.

694
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,478
-But you just hit again.

Cool. Gonna check in on that.

00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,130
-Frances. -See? Look.

712
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:28,218
It's basically done. Can you just open?

713
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,304
-Sure.

714
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:34,099
Okay. Food porn. Here we go.

Oh, yeah.

00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,857

718
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:42,357
Ahh!

00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,483

00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,701
Okay, yeah. So, uh, it'spretty much ready to go.

And...

723
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:57,581
Obviously, we're gonna give it a nice char.

724
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,710
-Oh, don't.

725
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,711
-Mmm!

726
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,880
-This isn't, like, conventional turkey,

727
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,885
but I think it's gonna be really good.

728
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:09,718
-Oh, God, Frances.

729
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,137
-You see all the moistness
really come out

730
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,808
in the water right here.

731
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:16,683
Be right back.

732
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:19,688
-Frances, that's enough,
seriously.

733
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,780
-Ta-da!

734
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:33,952
-Looks great.
-Just...

735
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:39,666
-I think they're using
Hannah's turkey.

736
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,925
-We can try both. It'll be like a...

737
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,968
-That looks really good.

738
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,470
Definitely can't eat this.
-Yeah.

739
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:57,474
Oh, no. We -- We can, you know,
make it into a...

740
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,225
-It'll be fine. She'll understand.

741
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:00,560
She'll understand.

742
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,228
Where is the turkey, Frances?

743
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,189
-I thought I could
bring us closer.

744
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:07,150
-I didn't have enough time to cook it because, you know...

745
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:14,658
-No!

746
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,326
No! No!

747
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,413

-Assholes.

755
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,877
What the fuck do you want?

756
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,260

-Dank food.

778
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,836
-Excuse me. Let me fucking finish.

779
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,339
-Mel, I think I would actually like to say grace tonight.

780
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:20,678
-You wouldn't know Grace if she fucked you in the ass.

781
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:23,722
Rude. -Oh, my heck.

782
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:27,601
-I'm sorry. Do you have a problem with my language?

783
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:28,935
-That move is sick, bro.

784
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,228
-Okay, I know I just had the most

785
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,692
cathartic freakout of my life, but I'm not far from a second.

786
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:36,943
-Mm, nobody wants that from you.

787
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:38,403
-And what do we want from you?

788
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:42,157
The girl that can't go three months without getting high.

789
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,909
-I'm sorry, when was the last time<i>you</i>went</i>

790
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:47,538
three months without getting high?

791
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,788
-Why are you even here?

792
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,541
-Okay, I<i>was</i>going to apologize</i>

793
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:52,500
for bullying you two
in high school,

794
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:55,754
but now lookwho's the fucking bully.

795
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,005
-She has a point.

796
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:58,256
-Oh, says the born-again

797
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:02,595
who can't handle a slightest inconvenience.

798
00:46:03,723 --> 00:46:06,181
Damn. -Wait.

799
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:07,932
Let me smell your mouth.

800
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:08,433
-No.

801
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,351
No. Fuck off. Stop!-Let me smell your mouth.

802
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:13,938
-Knew it! You red-wine-stained-
teeth-having-ass bitch.

803
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,693
-Leave her alone, Frances.

804
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:20,069
-Seriously?

805
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,322
-I'm so annoyed at him saying that.

806
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,240
-Can I just not fucking
speak around you?

807
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:27,327
-Literally everything you say
is fucking annoying.

808
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,455
Just because your beats are fire doesn't mean that any of us

809
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:33,542
want to hear the stupid shit that comes out of your mouth.

810
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:38,880
-Babe, I think we shouldget the fuck out of here.

811
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:41,049
-Huh?

812
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:44,177
-I think it's time we go home.

813
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:48,431
-Go where? You can't drive.

814
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:51,518
-Can you not drive?

815
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,603
-Absolutely not.

816
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:55,063
-You know, we don't have to take this.

817
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,649
You know we don't have to take this.

818
00:46:56,651 --> 00:47:01,277
-Oh, no, no, I-I want to see all of this.

819
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:05,323
-Babe, I think we should just go home. We just go home.

820
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,618
-No, we're not leaving.

821
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,161
You brought me here to see who you are

822
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,997
in this other relationship.

823
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:18,419
I still don't get it.

824
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:21,464
Like, just tell me the truth.

825
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,341
Why are we here?

826
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:28,890
Did you -- Did you bring me here to...

827
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:32,016
fuck her?

828
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:34,352
-All right -- -You want to know the truth?

829
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:37,648
-Please. Please. Please.

830
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,400
-The truth is, I convinced Atticus

831
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:44,195
to open up your guys' relationship because I thought,

832
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:49,827
"Let's see how cool your girlfriend really is."

833
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:52,830
And you know what?

834
00:47:52,832 --> 00:47:55,081
You're not that cool.

835
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:55,582
-Oh.

836
00:47:55,584 --> 00:48:00,504
You know, it's kind of pathetic how you hang on to him still.

837
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:05,383
He just uses you. -Oh, really?

838
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:08,386
Who uses who?

839
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,684
-It's "whom."

840
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,772
It's "whom."

841
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,653
"Whom."

842
00:48:26,197 --> 00:48:28,615
Atticus?

843
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,115
Atticus.

844
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:32,911
-Hey. Atticus. -No, what did you do?

845
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,245
What did you do, Mel?

846
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:37,916
-Okay, relax. I just dropped
a Xeroofex in his drink.

847
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:40,209
It's the doggie Xanax, you guys.

848
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:40,753
-Melissa!

849
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,755
-Don't even fucking
full-name me.

850
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:45,298
-You could have killed him.

851
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,467
-He's fine. Just a little sleepy.

852
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,427
-Oh, my God. -Uh, you're welcome.

853
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:52,598
He was being fucking annoying, and he stole my catchphrase.

854
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,893
-Yo, I drug JD all the time.
It's chill.

855
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:57,897
-See?

856
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,902
-JD, are you drinking?

857
00:49:04,904 --> 00:49:06,402
-Yeah. I'm having a glass.

858
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:11,493
-Since when do you drink?
-Since tonight.

859
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:13,744
-But I stopped drinking for you.

860
00:49:13,746 --> 00:49:17,792
-Okay, I never asked you to do that.

861
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:22,546
-Hannah, are you okay?

862
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,760
-Uh...

863
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:32,387
Can I ask you a question?

864
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,181
Why are you here?

865
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:40,813
-Oh, okay.I mean, can I be honest?

866
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:43,106
-Can you?

867
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:45,233
-I thought...

868
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:47,569
that if I came here,

869
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:52,825
I could prove to Atticusthat I can be open-minded

870
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:56,494
to accept this<i>other</i>part
of his life</i>

871
00:49:56,496 --> 00:50:00,874
that he's kept compartmentalized
from me for so long.

872
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:05,461
I -- I wanted to believe that your relationship

873
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,507
with him was purely physical.

874
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:13,637
I thought you were gonna be a lot hotter,

875
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,682
and you're not that hot.

876
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:25,066
Like, you're -- you're, like,
naturally pretty.

877
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:27,901
Which is much worse.

878
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:31,154
-Thank you. I think.
-I guess...

879
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,197
I guess I just thought that if I came here,

880
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,829
he would realize he<i>wants</i>to be
with me.</i>

881
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:42,165
To become more mature.

882
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,626
He says he doesn't want to get married until he's 30.

883
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:47,253
Well, I'm almost 30 and I can't wait around

884
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:51,508
while my clock ticks until he changes his mind.

885
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,468
But -- But he's willing,
for some reason,

886
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,761
to go into buying property together,

887
00:50:54,763 --> 00:51:00,183
which is like a 20-year commitment, you know?

888
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:03,979
And now I'm here,

889
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:10,111
and I feel so dumb.

890
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:18,746
-Oh, I'm such a dick.

891
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,998
-Thank you for saying that.

892
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:27,293
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

893
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:28,629
Relax!

894
00:51:28,631 --> 00:51:30,839
-What are you doing? Stop!
-I mean...

895
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:31,673
I get it. I get it.

896
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:33,884
I'm over here making these
sacrifices for a guy

897
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:37,596
who literally needs to get punched in the face

898
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:38,847
to get his attention.

899
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,974
Like, are you kidding me?

900
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:42,350
-Oh, my God, you guys.

901
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:45,020
I almost forgot to apologize
for doing heroin

902
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:47,271
at your high-school graduation.

903
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:47,940
Oh, my God.

904
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:50,526
That's the whole point of me
being here was to do my,

905
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:52,819
like, living amends or whatever.

906
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,237
Okay, so I'm really sorry,

907
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,198
and I promise not to be like that anymore.

908
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,909
Like, maybe.

909
00:51:58,911 --> 00:51:59,826
-Thanks, Mel.

910
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:03,204
Looks to me like we're gonna
order Postmates, right?

911
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:03,956
-Um, fuck yeah.

912
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,750
-But my turkey's fucking good.
-I'll Venmo you.

913
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:09,460
-This one's on Daddy number two.

914
00:52:09,462 --> 00:52:11,420
-And I guess...

915
00:52:11,422 --> 00:52:19,515
cheers to our biological clocks
and delusional grandeurs.

916
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,140
-Wait!

917
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,182
Did someone say cocaine?

918
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:24,308
-Aah! Where?! -Fuck yeah!

919
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,270
-I don't know. I thought someone here had to have it.

920
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:28,479
-Uh...

921
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:31,817
I have this Adderall my mom makes me take.

922
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:33,694

Aah!

00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,130
Hey.

970
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:22,923
-Hey.

971
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:27,135
-Have you done this before?

972
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:30,182
-Not with you.

973
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,019
-Let's turn the light off.

974
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:39,189
-Oh, my God. Fuck, fuck!

975
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:40,524
Oh, my God. Is that a fucking bug?!

976
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:42,984
Oh, my God! Turn the light back on!

977
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:46,655
-Ladies, let's have an open
and honest conversation

978
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,406
about our relationship.

979
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,909
-Honesty is so manipulative.

980
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:51,868
-He's a fucking hypocrite.

981
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,539
Thinks he's all progressive and shit because he eats pussy.

982
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,707
-He's -- He's a "feminist"

983
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:02,461
who's literally addicted
to bondage porn.

984
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:07,926
-Atticus.

985
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:10,889
We're out of his league.

986
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:20,939
-He told me he's not happy with the sex we've been having.

987
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:23,859
-Are you?

988
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:27,153
-I come every time.

989
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:29,239
-Same.

990
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:33,326
- I mean, so does he.

991
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,873
-Yeah, obviously.

992
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:39,207
-I hate him.

993
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,835
-No, you don't.

994
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:44,464
I don't either.

995
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:50,427
To be honest, I'm glad he didn't choose me.

996
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:53,638
-Oh, you think he chose me?

997
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,851
-Duh. He's gonna marry you.

998
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,312
- No.

999
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:03,358
He's waiting for you.

1000
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:10,157
-I think we both know he is not waiting for anyone.

1001
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,786
-True. He wants everyone.

1002
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:22,667
Now I get why he's kept us away
from each other.

1003
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:26,048
That fuck-boy.

1004
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:40,521
-Are you using his move on me?

1005
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:43,563

this more often.

-Of course I care about values.

1040
01:00:56,948 --> 01:01:01,743
Morality. I feel like everybody
should be open-minded.

1041
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,537
You know?

1042
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:05,413

1043
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:10,588
