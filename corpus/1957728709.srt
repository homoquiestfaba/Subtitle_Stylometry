and love and friendship stuff?

180
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,657
All that stuff
was left back in India.

I need to get to my meeting now.

182

Okay, look, I'm sorry.

I tell you what.

184
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:23,757
I'll take off the charge
for the ride, and...

185
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,863
You can have this too.
That's all the money I have.

Please don't give me a
bad rating. I need this job.

How are you gonna be
a U-Lift driver

188
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,436
with a piece of junk of a car?

189
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,141
You need some help?

190
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,377
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

191
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,079
[laughs]
With the car, I mean.

192
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,481
You need to move it.

193
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,985
Um, yeah, thanks.

194
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,541
Thanks man, I...
I really appreciate the help.

195

Sure thing.

196
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,351
I'm sorry, I just gave
my last cash to the rider.

197

[Sam] So, what's the news?

198
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,696
I lost my job.

199
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,799
You got fired from U-Lift?

200
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,602
No, I can't drive U-Lift anymore

201
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,838
because my stupid car
broke down.

202
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:47,876
And the mechanic said it would
be $1,000 to fix, which I can't afford.

203
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,478
I see.

204
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,281
Sam, I don't think
you understand.

205
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,985
If I don't work,
we can't afford rent.

206
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,186
And we'll get kicked out
of our house.

207
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,787
We can't afford
to live together,

208
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:03,457
so I'll be forced to go move in
with my mom.

209
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,759
There's no way in hell
that's happening.

210
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:10,097
So, basically we're done
and I'm going to be homeless.

211
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:15,035
And you don't think you're
overreacting like just a little bit?

212
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,537
No, no, I don't.

213
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,205
My life is shit right now.

I am on the worst string
of bad luck.

215
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:24,044
Nothing is going right, everything is
falling apart, not just my stupid car.

00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,680
- I think I'm cursed.
- Maybe so.

217
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,315
But you know what they say,

"It's always darkest
before the dawn," and all that.

219

So, um, who knows?

220
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:35,756
Maybe today is the day
that everything changes.

221
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,058
What does that even mean?

222
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,862
Are you gonna give me
some positivity pep talk?

223
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,497
[laughs] No.

224
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,632
Remember my friend
from work, Kumar?

225
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,568
Uh, yeah,
he's the IT guy, right?

226
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,703
Yeah, well, he told me
this morning

227
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,205
that he's going to India
for three months

228
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,575
to visit his home city
of Baroda.

229
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,344
Okay, so how is that
good news for me?

230
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,246
Because...

231
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,987
he gave me his car

232
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,390
and said that I can use it whenever I want
while he's gone so it doesn't just sit around.

233
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:13,560
And it's a really nice car.

234
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:16,597
Much better than the old smokey
that you were driving.

I should have.

when I left his place,

Yeah, I guess.

But if I could just figure out
what's causing this wave, then...

356
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,968
maybe I could get
in the sweet spot

357
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,404
- and ride it for as long as possible.
- Mm.

Okay.

So I found money and a
bunch of groceries in my car...

Well, in your friend's car...

two passengers.

And it didn't belong
to your passengers?

366
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,327
Correct.

367
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,831
Then you dropped off
other passengers,

368
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:07,234
but didn't find anything
with them, right?

369
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:13,307
So, what did those two
passengers have in common

370
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,179
that wasn't true
for the other passengers?

Okay.

in the back of the car.

And I think I know now what's causing
this wave of good luck for me, you know?

414
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,207
Well, what is it?

415
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,776
It's a homeless guy.

I... I mean,
can you believe that?

417
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,450
It's a homeless guy.

418
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:40,521
Okay, so when you say
"homeless,"

419
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,223
you mean like...

420
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,959
I don't know exactly, but... but
every time I give him something,

421
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,027
I get back 10 times as much.

422
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:50,130
So I gave him $20
and then I got back $200.

423
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,565
And one day I gave him lunch,

424
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,334
and we got all those groceries.

425
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:57,004
So today I gave him
your old pair of running shoes

426
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:00,773
and found all these boxes
in the back of my car.

427
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:08,649
I think he's like a magical
good luck charm.

we should ride this wave

Oh, this is
some really good wine.

I found it in the groceries
that were in the car.

437

But I think we only have
one bottle left.

00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,463
Anything else?

529
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,398
Well, I have been thinking.

530
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:35,003
And I think that we need
to be more strategic.

531
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,304
What do you mean?

532
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,373
Well, don't get me wrong.

533
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:42,043
I love getting all the things

534
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:44,879
and the fact that we've been able
to make a couple thousand dollars

535
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:48,281
from selling the surplus
is great.

536
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:50,550
I just think it's time
that we got back

537
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:52,586
to the way that you started.

538
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,388
You know, by giving him money.

539
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:55,622
Okay.

540
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:59,559
That makes sense.

541
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,395
But it won't be as fun.

542
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:04,498
Since when is more money
not fun?

543
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,867
Okay, good point.

544
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,136
To more money.

545
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:09,971
To more money.

546
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:30,424
How much are you gonna give him?

547
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:32,526
I was thinking $1,000.

548
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:37,431
That would give us $10,000.

549
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,534
Yeah, okay.

550
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,874
[female passenger] So how long
have you been working for U-Lift?

551
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:49,043
Uh, a little over a month now.

552
00:31:49,077 --> 00:31:50,644
You like it?

553
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,312
It didn't start off too well,

554
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:56,984
but lately it's been
very rewarding.

555
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:58,385
[passenger] That's good.

556
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:12,299
What's up, buttercup?

557
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:16,003
[laughs] Hey, it looks like this
corner's getting pretty crowded.

558
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,537
Probably my fault.

559
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,215
I've been talking too much
about the good luck

560
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,942
I've been having on this corner.

561
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,643
What's going on?

562
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:25,813
Is there a convention in town?

563
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:29,150
Oh, no, I'm just trying
to do a good deed

564
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,784
for someone less fortunate.

565
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:37,591
Don't tell anyone about this.

566
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,504
[Jeff] Hey, sorry for
the detour back there.

567
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,572
Maybe it was
just a fender bender.

568
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:57,444
Have a nice day.

569
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,047
[passenger] You too.

570
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:02,749
[Jeff] Oh, yeah,
I definitely will.

571
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:04,584
Can you meet me
at the coffee shop now?

572
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,419
[Sam] <i>Sure, hon.</i>
<i>On my way.</i>

573
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,093
Well?

574
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,910
Jeff!

575
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:31,212
[funky music]

576
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,071
This seems really quick.

577
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:00,674
Why? Look, if we just give him
this money,

578
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,443
we'll have $100,000.

579
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,579
Yeah, good point.

580
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:08,782
Hey, um, do you know
where the other guy is?

581
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:11,585
I don't know his name, but he
usually stands on this corner.

582
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:13,520
You got a better description?

583
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:16,157
Um, well, he...

584
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,825
Yeah, he's the guy
with the funny signs.

585
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,659
We all got signs.

586
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:23,197
What, you don't think
my sign is funny?

587
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:25,432
Not bad.

588
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,870
You're not gonna give me
something?

589
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,938
Sorry, man,
you're not the right guy.

590
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,573
Cheap bastard.

591
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,412
[light music]

592
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:24,758
[whirring]

593
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,103
You lost your good luck charm.

594
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:40,408
He's a person, Sam.

595
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,043
Mm, a person.

596
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:45,645
- Whose name you don't know. Nice.
- [phone ringing]

597
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:50,351
It's been less than a day.

598
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:52,420
Okay, I saw him
yesterday morning.

599
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:55,823
- I'll find him, don't worry.
- Mm.

600
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:59,759
Yeah, well, you're not taking
the 10 grand with you until you do.

601
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:05,765
Okay.

602
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:08,903
Let me just get a shower
and some coffee, -[phone rings]

603
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:10,570
and I'll get back out there.

604
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:12,639
He's gotta be
out there somewhere.

605
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:17,577
Hey, Mom.

606
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,879
What's wrong?

607
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:24,118
Yeah, okay, sure, I'll meet you.

608
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:26,887
But then I have to
get out there and drive.

609
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:31,292
Okay, U-Lift is my job, Mom,
and it's a real job.

610
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:32,827
I'll see you later.

611
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:38,332
[sighing]

612
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,237
Come, sit down.

613
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,738
How's my boy doing?

614
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:49,243
Mom, you know
I don't like that stuff.

615
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:51,412
Remember what I said?

616
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:53,247
It's an acquired taste.

617
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,950
You won't like it
until you drink enough of it

618
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:58,252
so your distaste for it
goes away.

619
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:02,589
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Really?

620
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:05,192
Think about the first time
you drank a beer.

621
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:16,703
So, what's the big 911?

622
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:20,508
Oh, I just wanted to see you
and see how you're doing.

623
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,642
It's been so long.

624
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:24,778
I'm sorry I don't call you
more often.

625
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:27,348
But I am thinking about you
all the time.

626
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:30,951
I just wanted to see you,
see how you're doing.

627
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:34,121
And you don't look too good
right now.

628
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:35,256
Well...

629
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,560
everything was going fine
until yesterday and then...

630
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,532
You can tell me.

631
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:46,067
It's a long story.

632
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,635
[light music]

633
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:54,375
And that's how I lost
my lucky charm.

634
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:57,478
I'm sorry you feel that way,
but...

635
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,014
I really don't think
that's what happened.

636
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,682
What do you mean?
I... I can't find the guy.

637
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:05,752
Well, I mean, I think
it wasn't luck at all.

638
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,888
I... I don't think
you need that guy,

639
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:10,723
though it was nice
that you helped him.

640
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:14,161
I actually think
it was instant karma.

641
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:16,897
I read about it the other day
on the "inter web."

642
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,366
It's fascinating.

643
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,335
Have you heard of it?

644
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,407
Instant karma
is when you do good for anyone

645
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,244
and something good
immediately happens for you.

646
00:38:30,277 --> 00:38:32,745
That's what happened,
I'm sure of it.

647
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,248
All you need to do now

648
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:38,419
is go back to work at your job
and do good to anyone.

649
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:43,591
Did you just say
what I do for U-Lift is a job?

650
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:46,861
I sure did, honey.

651
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:49,196
I'm sorry about the other day.

652
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:52,900
I also read about U-Lift
on the "inter web"

653
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:57,637
and now see it is a valuable
part of our new gig economy.

654
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:01,442
Mom, you're incredible.

655
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,776
I don't care what anyone
says about you.

656
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:07,548
- What are people saying about me?
- [laughs]

657
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:09,583
Nothing.

658
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,485
Nobody's talking about you, Mom.

659
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:17,091
I have to get back to work,
but thanks for the drink.

660
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:18,559
It wasn't as bad as last time.

661
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:21,162
See, what did I tell you?

662
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,695
Just like a beer!

663
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,471
[door closes]

664
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:46,654
Mom, I can't talk right now.

665
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:48,721
I have a passenger
I have to pick up right here.

666
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:50,524
I know, honey, it's me.

667
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:52,026
I'm your passenger.

668
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:58,132
How can I tell all my friends

669
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,435
how much I love and support you
if I don't support you?

670
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:04,405
You're awesome, Mom.

671
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:14,815
Hey, man.

672
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,418
You look thirsty.
Do you want something to drink?

673
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:20,020
Uh, not really, no.

674
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:24,124
I knew I should've gotten water.

675
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:25,492
Just relax.

676
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,394
The universe will bring you
the right person

677
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:28,795
at the perfect time.

678
00:40:38,872 --> 00:40:40,841
[Jeff] Are you thirsty?

679
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:42,742
Yeah.
Can I have that?

680
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,411
You know what this stuff is,
right?

681
00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:47,314
- Yeah, I've had that before.
- All right. [laughs]

682
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:50,150
Sorry, I don't have some food
to give you too.

683
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,621
Aw, thanks, man. But like
my sign says, anything helps.

684
00:40:54,754 --> 00:40:56,056
[Mom] Wait a minute.

685
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,658
Let's give him this.

686
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:04,098
Wow.

687
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:08,335
Wow!

688
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,838
Thanks, man. You don't know
how much this is gonna help.

689
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,106
It's not a problem.

690
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,707
Hey, what's your name,
by the way?

691
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:16,510
Charles.
But my friends call me Chuck.

692
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:17,845
All right, Chuck.

693
00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:20,114
It's nice to meet you.
I'll see you around.

694
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,548
Oh, thank you so much.

695
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:23,651
God bless you, God bless you.

696
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,860
That's it, we did our part.

697
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,663
Now we just wait for it
to come back to us.

698
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,269
Thanks again, Mom.

699
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:49,643
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

700
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:52,046
I guess everything you read
on the internet

701
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,914
isn't always true.

702
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,249
That's okay, Mom.

703
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:57,351
It was just fun
to hang out with you.

704
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,354
[door closes]

705
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:05,626
Where have you been all day?

706
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,928
I was with my mom.

707
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:09,963
Oh, great.

708
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:13,067
Bet you didn't even try
to look for your lucky charm.

709
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,702
Correct.

710
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,971
I told you not to waste
your time with her.

711
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,507
You know she doesn't
even believe in you.

712
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,109
Well, right now it seems like

713
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:24,611
you're the one
who doesn't believe in me.

714
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:26,680
Well, can you blame me?

715
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,850
It seems like
you're pretty tired right now.

716
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,485
Maybe you should just go to bed.

717
00:42:31,518 --> 00:42:35,322
Who are you
to tell me what to do?

718
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:39,193
You were failing at one thing
and then another thing,

719
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,528
and I'm the one
that stood by you

720
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,131
when no one in their right mind
would have.

721
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:47,868
You know, sometimes
I wonder why I even did that.

722
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:51,305
Wow, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

723
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,675
You stumbled upon
the biggest lucky charm

724
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,043
that I've ever heard of,

725
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,179
and then right before
we can hit it big, you blow it!

726
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:00,815
You lose him,

727
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:04,518
and now you're acting
like it's not even a big deal!

728
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:06,286
Hey, will you calm down?

729
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,157
I know it's a big deal.

730
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,627
And I'm sorry
that I "lost the homeless guy."

731
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,063
But did you ever think
that maybe he wasn't

732
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,665
the lucky charm
that we thought he was?

733
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,033
Of course he is.

734
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:21,535
What are you talking about?

735
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:24,138
How else do you explain
all of the magical stuff

736
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,339
that's been happening?

737
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:26,974
What if it wasn't him?

738
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,244
What if it was...

739
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,813
instant karma?

740
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:34,014
Did you ever think about that?

741
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:35,716
Instant karma?

742
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:37,651
What is that?

743
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,453
My Mom told me about it today.

744
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:41,823
She read about it online.

745
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:46,260
It's the act of doing
a good deed to anyone

746
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,395
resulting in good
coming back to you.

747
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,564
Seriously?

748
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:53,167
It's a real thing.

749
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,068
I looked it up.

750
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:57,237
So Mom and I drove around
all day giving stuff

751
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,173
to another homeless guy.

752
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,407
Well?

753
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:04,011
Did it work?

754
00:44:04,813 --> 00:44:05,847
No.

755
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,249
Are you sure?

756
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:11,853
Yeah, we checked everywhere
in the car and...

757
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:13,454
and didn't find anything.

758
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:15,890
What about the hatchback?

759
00:44:15,924 --> 00:44:18,425
[light music]

760
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:25,332
[trunk beeping]

761
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:46,220
[male passenger]
So how is your day going today?

762
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,455
Oh, pretty good.

763
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,524
I got in a big fight
with my girlfriend last night,

764
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,961
but we've already made up.

765
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:55,162
Wow, that's impressive.

766
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,563
What did you do?

767
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,833
Well, I have to give her
most of the credit.

768
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:01,168
But I did make her pancakes.

769
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,403
So that's your secret?
Pancakes.

770
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,876
Sorry to bother you, but...

771
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:09,643
you look really familiar.

772
00:45:09,676 --> 00:45:11,345
Should I recognize you
from somewhere?

773
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:16,250
Well, maybe you've seen my photo
in the post office on the wall there.

774
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:19,419
- America's most wanted.
- [chuckling]

775
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:22,155
I don't think
they do that anymore.

776
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:25,192
But, seriously,
where do I know you from?

777
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,694
You got me.

778
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,864
So, I'm the Mayor of Chandler.

779
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:32,000
I knew it. I knew it!

780
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:34,501
That's pretty cool.

781
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:38,105
It must be a tough job.

782
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:40,140
Everybody wanting
something from you.

783
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:43,243
[Mayor] That it is, my friend.
That it is.

784
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:51,886
Hey, before you go,
can I give you something?

785
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:53,787
Sure.

786
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,058
A stick of gum?

787
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:00,360
Should I take this personally?

788
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:04,231
No, no, I'm just giving a
small gift to all my riders today

789
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:07,035
to celebrate me
making up with my girlfriend.

790
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:08,545
That's just what I grabbed
from the bag,

791
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:11,138
but you can take
something else if you'd like.

792
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:12,874
No, this is good.

793
00:46:12,907 --> 00:46:15,142
Maybe I do need it.
Thanks.

794
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,219
Hi there.
Let me help you out.

795
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,824
Oh, one second.
Let me move this.

796
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:32,392
[ethereal music]

797
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:40,068
Sorry about that.

798
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,008
Just right here.

799
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,751
So, how's your day going so far?

800
00:46:57,784 --> 00:47:01,055
Who are you
and where are you taking me?

801
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:04,358
- Gotcha!
- [laughing]

802
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:08,762
Seriously, it's been
a great day so far.

803
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:12,799
We got two new residents
and they're both men.

804
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,969
Oh, so you're not married.

805
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:16,470
Not currently.

806
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,107
But check back with me in a week
and I'll let ya know.

807
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,141
[both laughing]

808
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:26,047
So are you meeting some
of your girlfriends for lunch?

809
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,583
I'm meeting my boyfriend
for happy hour!

810
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:31,986
Wow.
Well, he's a very lucky guy.

811
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:57,045
This is for you.

812
00:47:58,112 --> 00:48:00,414
This is so beautiful.

813
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,482
Thanks so much.

814
00:48:02,516 --> 00:48:06,186
And if things don't work out at
lunch, I may have to call you later.

815
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:08,156
[laughs] Have a good time.

816
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:19,766
- Hey.
- Hey.

817
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,171
[both lightly moan]

818
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:30,078
It is bigger and better
than I had ever imagined.

819
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:32,880
What?

820
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:35,449
Babe!

821
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:37,551
- Oh, my God.
- Ah, ah.

822
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,387
Let's go in the backyard, okay.

823
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,355
I'll tell you all about it.

824
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:43,557
- Okay?
- [groans]

825
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:49,130
[trunk beeping]

826
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:57,171
Okay, so anytime
you give anybody anything,

827
00:48:57,205 --> 00:49:00,707
it magically comes back to you
ten times?

828
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:02,076
Yep.

829
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,544
Passengers, homeless people,

830
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:07,949
random strangers on the sidewalk
or in parking lots, anyone.

831
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,887
But did it work with money too?

832
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,288
I didn't have any on me,
but I'm sure it will.

833
00:49:16,556 --> 00:49:18,192
Hopefully.

834
00:49:18,226 --> 00:49:19,693
But I think
that we should try it

835
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:21,963
before we go in
for the big score again.

836
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:24,431
Copy.

837
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:30,071
Mm! I almost forgot.

838
00:49:30,104 --> 00:49:32,739
That guy Frank called
and your car's ready.

839
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,279
- Jeff, what is happening? How are you?
- Frank.

840
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:41,249
Life is great.

841
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:43,184
Life is great?
Wunderbar!

842
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:46,220
You should put the
"Life is Great" on a shirt.

843
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:48,789
- There's an idea.
- Yeah, let me show you your car.

844
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:55,963
[tools whirring]

845
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:04,437
I thought it was fixed.

846
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:07,108
It is,
but it's not what you thought.

847
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:10,144
You thought your engine
was blocked and locked up.

848
00:50:10,178 --> 00:50:12,412
It wasn't.
You had plenty of engine oil.

849
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:14,816
We had a simple
fuel system cleaning.

850
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:17,317
That took care of it.
You're good to go.

851
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,385
Wow.

852
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:20,620
Thanks.

853
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,665
But so you know, I don't
know what any of that means

854
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,126
that you just told me
about my car.

855
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,760
Except that...

856
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:29,063
you could have ripped me off
and charged me

857
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:32,332
for a big repair that I
didn't need, but instead...

858
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:34,068
you looked out for me.

859
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:36,070
- Thanks.
- It's not about me.

860
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,572
If I take care of you,
I've got a business model.

861
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:41,175
It's all about you.
Let's get you checked out.

862
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,374
Would you mind
sitting in the back seat?

863
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:19,213
[door closes]

864
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:26,519
Let's go!

865
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,893
Do you hear me?

866
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:34,362
- We gotta hurry!
- Yep.

867
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,595
On our way.

868
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:43,204
Should I ask
why you're in such a hurry?

869
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:49,243
I just knocked out
my stupid boyfriend.

870
00:51:49,277 --> 00:51:51,678
And I stole his drugs.

871
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:53,680
[chuckling]

872
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:56,083
Well, that's something
I don't hear every day.

873
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:00,087
I wouldn't even know
how to knock someone out.

874
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:07,395
Well, it's easy
when you got one of these.

875
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,230
[chuckling]

876
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:12,099
Wow.

877
00:52:13,234 --> 00:52:14,567
That's a big gun.

878
00:52:18,272 --> 00:52:19,840
Oh, damn!

879
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:23,210
Something wrong?

880
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:25,913
I forgot my damn ChapStick!

881
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:27,848
Oh, um, I can help you
with that.

882
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,783
I... I think I have some
in my bag here.

883
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:31,551
- Hold on a second here.
- [horn honks]

884
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:33,020
Watch it!

885
00:52:33,054 --> 00:52:34,721
Are you trying to kill us?

886
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:37,358
Yeah, sorry.
Um... sorry.

887
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:39,693
Here.

888
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:42,595
Just take the bag.
You can find it yourself.

889
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:53,975
[sighing]

890
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:58,145
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- Yes.

891
00:52:58,179 --> 00:53:00,580
I can't live
without my ChapStick.

892
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:03,750
Glad you had the good stuff.

893
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:08,621
So, what else you got up there?

894
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,126
You got any money?

895
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:17,431
Here, take whatever you want.

896
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:18,631
Oh.

897
00:53:29,676 --> 00:53:31,045
All right, here we are.

898
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,248
[kisses, blows]

899
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:53,367
So, did you really
pee your pants?

900
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,070
Yeah, a little.

901
00:53:59,073 --> 00:54:00,341
Anyway...

902
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:04,445
I have a coworker
that also drives for U-Lift,

903
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:08,282
and he tells me the craziest
stories about passengers.

904
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:09,984
Yeah, involving guns?

905
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:11,352
No.

906
00:54:11,385 --> 00:54:13,720
Which means that
this was probably just a one-off

907
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:15,189
and won't happen again.

908
00:54:15,222 --> 00:54:18,225
Did you have any problems
with your other passengers?

909
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,827
Didn't have any.

910
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,864
Just drove around for the
rest of the day and jammed out.

911
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:25,799
Can we just change the subject?

912
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:29,769
Okay, do you know
what you're gonna give next?

913
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:34,208
Not really.

914
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:37,211
- Do you think you'll wanna drive tomorrow?
- Okay, stop, please.

915
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:39,679
I feel like
you're interrogating me.

916
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:42,183
Let me just go get the stuff
from the car.

917
00:54:42,216 --> 00:54:43,650
Can I help?

918
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:46,120
[mouthing]

919
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,690
Sam, we... we have a problem.

920
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:52,026
What? What happened?

921
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:54,028
I went to get the stuff
out of the car,

922
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:57,431
and I opened up the back,
and it was empty.

923
00:54:57,465 --> 00:55:01,668
I gave that lady a whole bag of
stuff and I didn't get anything in return.

924
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:04,205
Shit.
Am I losing the magic already?

925
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:05,705
It's okay.

926
00:55:05,738 --> 00:55:07,842
There's gotta be
some kind of explanation.

927
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,742
Let's just talk it out.

928
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,046
What happened differently
with this passenger?

929
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,381
Well, there were multiple items.

930
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:16,217
But we did that
with the homeless man, so.

931
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,586
Can you think of anything else?

932
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:21,422
Um, she was in the car
when I gave her the stuff,

933
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:23,756
but, well,
we've done that before.

934
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:26,626
So that's not it.

935
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:28,829
Okay, relax.

936
00:55:29,563 --> 00:55:30,998
There's no pressure.

937
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,300
I think I know what it is.

938
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:38,771
I didn't actually give her
anything.

939
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:41,308
I thought you said she took,
like, two bags of stuff.

940
00:55:41,342 --> 00:55:43,444
That's just it,
she... she took it.

941
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:45,446
I didn't give her anything.

942
00:55:45,479 --> 00:55:47,314
I put the bags in the back seat

943
00:55:47,348 --> 00:55:49,550
and said she could take
whatever she wanted.

944
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:52,319
I think that's it.

945
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,661
Hey, I came as quick as I could.

946
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:03,164
What's up?

947
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:04,465
What is that?

948
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:06,467
This all made sense at the time.

949
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,136
Babe, I don't know what you're
thinking unless you talk to me.

950
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:11,972
Think about it.

951
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:14,808
I was... shit out of luck.

952
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:17,011
Every day
my life was getting worse.

953
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:19,280
Not counting you, of course.

954
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:21,115
And then I met the homeless guy.

955
00:56:21,148 --> 00:56:25,586
I gave him $20 and I find $200
in the front seat of the car.

956
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,588
And I get to keep it.

957
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:29,924
Then I gave him lunch,

958
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:32,660
and we scored
all those big bags of groceries.

959
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:35,663
So we're thinking he must
be my lucky charm, right?

960
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:38,432
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

961
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:39,667
But then I lost him.

962
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,035
Then Mom showed up.

963
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:44,171
And she said
that it wasn't him at all.

964
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:45,772
It had nothing to do with him.

965
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:48,708
She said it was instant karma.

966
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,513
So we drove around
the rest of that day

967
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:55,616
and we gave drinks and money
to a different homeless person.

968
00:56:55,649 --> 00:56:58,852
Turns out...
it was instant karma.

969
00:56:58,886 --> 00:57:00,221
[Sam]
Sounds good to me.

970
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,721
Of course it does.

971
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,625
Then I gave the mayor
a pack of gum.

972
00:57:04,658 --> 00:57:07,528
I find ten packs of gum
in the back seat of the car.

973
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,164
I met that really nice old lady,
gave her that beautiful scarf.

974
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:11,665
And so on and so forth

975
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:14,734
until the back seat of the car
is filled with stuff.

976
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:16,837
Ten times as much
as I had given away.

977
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,372
It was so fun.

978
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:22,543
Until I gave that stuff
to the crazy lady.

979
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:25,212
No, she took that stuff.

980
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,381
And I didn't get anything
in return.

981
00:57:28,082 --> 00:57:30,985
Okay,
so if it's not instant karma,

982
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:32,119
then what is it?

983
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:35,723
I think it must be
your friend's car.

984
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:37,391
Think about it.

985
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:39,426
Before that showed up,

986
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,362
I was on the worst string
of bad luck.

987
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:42,762
You were ready to leave me.

988
00:57:42,795 --> 00:57:45,532
And you probably should have
if things didn't change.

989
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:48,402
But they did change, big time...

990
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:51,505
as soon as I started driving
your friend's car.

991
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:53,507
And then when I tried
to do the same things

992
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,943
while driving my car,
it didn't work.

993
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:58,879
I think you're right.

994
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:01,715
But why would Kumar
give me a magical car?

995
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:03,217
[Jeff]
I don't know.

996
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,753
I think what we need
to do first is test this out

997
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:07,454
to see if I'm right.

998
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:10,190
And then we need to make a plan

999
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:12,760
on how to maximize
using this while we have it.

1000
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,961
Yeah.

1001
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:21,101
So, did you go to church much
when you were growing up?

1002
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,304
Yep.

1003
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:25,306
Sorry to hear that.

1004
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:26,440
What do you mean?

1005
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:29,643
Well, I've heard
so many horror stories

1006
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:33,547
of people who were
earnestly searching for God

1007
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,983
and got totally turned off.

1008
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:38,886
Some were even hurt or abused.

1009
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:40,087
Oh, none of that for me.

1010
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,056
I just lost interest
in high school.

1011
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:43,490
I discovered girls.

1012
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:46,560
Well, that'll happen.

1013
00:58:46,593 --> 00:58:48,595
And how about now?

1014
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:51,465
Um, you know,

1015
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:55,002
I guess I just try to live
by the golden rule.

1016
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:57,137
"Do unto others" and all that.

1017
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:58,505
Like karma.

1018
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,508
Give to others
and receive gifts in return.

1019
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,577
That's all good.

1020
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,980
"Give and you will be
given to."

1021
00:59:07,014 --> 00:59:08,248
Exactly.

1022
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,585
Hey, you know what,
let me show you how it works.

1023
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,729
Hey, come here a second.

1024
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:31,138
Okay, you got a deal.

1025
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:32,706
Who's first?

1026
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,875
Uh, no, you have the wrong idea.

1027
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,443
You don't have to do anything.

1028
00:59:36,477 --> 00:59:37,745
That's a gift.

1029
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:42,082
Thank you.

1030
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:47,287
I was a little nervous
for a bit there, young man.

1031
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:50,691
[passenger] I was little worried
about this.

1032
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,632
[rock music playing]

1033
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,078
[Jeff] Well, it's clear that
you only reached out to me

1034
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,638
so that you could have someone
to beat up on in tennis.

1035
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:07,307
Well, I always remember you
being better than me in college, so.

1036
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:10,812
Okay, then either one of us
hasn't played much since then,

1037
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:12,646
or one of us has played a lot.

1038
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:14,816
- Or maybe both.
- [chuckles]

1039
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,251
Anyways, thank you
for letting me beat up on you

1040
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,386
and being a good sport about it.

1041
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,788
Of course, man.

1042
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:22,891
This has been a lot of fun.

1043
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:24,658
I can't remember the last time

1044
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:27,261
that I had some guy time
since I started dating Sam.

1045
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,196
Yeah, it's been a while
for me also.

1046
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:30,931
It's great to catch up.

1047
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:32,867
You know,
I never would have pegged you

1048
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:34,903
for a U-Lift driver.

1049
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:37,204
But it sounds like
it's working out for you, so...

1050
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:38,572
that's cool.

1051
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:43,277
Yeah, and I'm really sorry
to hear about your mom's cancer.

1052
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,714
Yeah, well, at least she's getting
great care here at the clinic, so.

1053
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:49,183
That's all you can hope for.

1054
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:51,920
But I hear
that's really expensive.

1055
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:53,787
How's her insurance?

1056
01:00:53,822 --> 01:00:55,890
Let's just say
it's not the best,

1057
01:00:55,924 --> 01:00:58,492
but I'm working on a way
to supplement it, so.

1058
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:01,528
I'm glad to hear.

1059
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:05,599
Well, this has been
a lot of fun.

1060
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:07,367
The beer drinking part,
not so much

1061
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:09,904
getting my ass kicked
on the tennis court.

1062
01:01:09,938 --> 01:01:11,238
But I gotta run.

1063
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:13,373
Let's get together again
while you're in town.

1064
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,075
Yeah, definitely.

1065
01:01:15,108 --> 01:01:17,144
And let me pay for the beers.

1066
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:23,584
It's only $1,000, but...

1067
01:01:23,617 --> 01:01:25,586
I want you to have that
to help your mom.

1068
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:28,055
- Dude, I can't take your money.
- Don't worry about it.

1069
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:30,123
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1070
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:31,960
And don't even worry
about paying me back.

1071
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,005
[chuckles]

1072
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:50,177
You know that karma's
spelled with a K, right?

1073
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,146
Yeah, but we have a magic car.

1074
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,283
- So I had it made with a C.
- Oh. [laughs]

1075
01:01:56,316 --> 01:02:00,754
I love you in pink,
but this is really pink.

1076
01:02:00,787 --> 01:02:02,589
Yeah, I know.

1077
01:02:02,623 --> 01:02:04,959
It was the only color
they had left.

1078
01:02:04,993 --> 01:02:07,327
Maybe it'll fade
if I wash it a couple times.

1079
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:21,542
[laughs]
Wow, that shirt sure is pink!

1080
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,510
You get it at Goodwill?
[laughs]

1081
01:02:23,544 --> 01:02:26,346
First time I see you in a month
and now you're a comedian?

1082
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,849
What can I say?

1083
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:30,284
I'm trying to expand
on my comedic signage.

1084
01:02:31,552 --> 01:02:32,954
Speaking of which...

1085
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,722
What if I could change things?

1086
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:37,892
For you and Jennifer Aniston?

1087
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:39,359
Are you serious?

1088
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:41,963
Tell me more.

1089
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:44,565
Not here.

1090
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:45,799
Can I get in?

1091
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,711
Where to?

1092
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,176
Thanks for bringing me here.

1093
01:03:29,209 --> 01:03:31,712
I love this place.

1094
01:03:31,745 --> 01:03:34,048
It's a beautiful stadium.

1095
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:36,183
Have you ever been
to a game here?

1096
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:38,185
I wish.
I never had the money.

1097
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:43,423
When I was a kid
growing up in Chicago,

1098
01:03:43,457 --> 01:03:46,627
my dad used to take me
to Wrigley Field all the time.

1099
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:51,531
I even used to dream
about playing for the Cubs.

1100
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:57,105
Can I ask you something that I
should have asked you a long time ago?

1101
01:03:58,106 --> 01:03:59,573
Harry.

1102
01:03:59,606 --> 01:04:01,208
Harry Swayne.

1103
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:05,545
How'd you know
I was gonna ask that?

1104
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:07,447
No one ever asks me my name.

1105
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:11,718
Well, like I said, I've been
meaning to ask for a long time.

1106
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:13,821
Sorry, Harry.

1107
01:04:15,756 --> 01:04:18,826
I'm also curious...
Why did you disappear

1108
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,228
after the last time
I gave you the money?

1109
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,965
You're not going to like it.

1110
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,167
Well, why not? You think
I'll be upset that you...

1111
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,670
spent it on booze,
drugs, and women?

1112
01:04:30,303 --> 01:04:32,406
I wish.
Never had the chance.

1113
01:04:33,306 --> 01:04:34,675
What do you mean?

1114
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:39,246
One of the guys
on the corner that day

1115
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:41,281
saw you give me the cash

1116
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:44,152
and told a few of his friends.

1117
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:47,587
I... I tried to downplay it

1118
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:50,024
and act like it was no big deal,

1119
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:53,360
but when I left,
three guys followed me,

1120
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:55,729
jumped me, and...

1121
01:04:56,964 --> 01:04:58,365
beat the shit outta me.

1122
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:01,102
And took all the money.

1123
01:05:04,005 --> 01:05:06,640
And even worse, all my signs.

1124
01:05:06,673 --> 01:05:08,575
Sons of bitches.

1125
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:10,878
Don't be mad at 'em.

1126
01:05:11,913 --> 01:05:14,015
It's just how it is out here.

1127
01:05:14,048 --> 01:05:18,652
And... anyways, I spent
a few weeks in the hospital.

1128
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:21,688
Then they got me
into a rehab center to recover.

1129
01:05:24,192 --> 01:05:26,226
I'm just getting back to work
this week.

1130
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:27,829
[Jeff chuckles]

1131
01:05:27,862 --> 01:05:29,807
I'm glad you mentioned that.
I've always been curious.

1132
01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:32,699
How does that work?
Do you have to clock in?

1133
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:35,069
- [chuckling]
- Do you get to pick your corner

1134
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:37,637
or do you have like a supervisor
who assigns those to you?

1135
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:39,073
You're funny.

1136
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:41,641
I should get your help
with my new signs.

1137
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,981
Seriously, what if I could
help you with your sign today?

1138
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:51,886
If you can get Jennifer Aniston
to go out with me, sure, I'm down.

1139
01:05:51,919 --> 01:05:54,688
Well, I don't know
if I have that much money.

1140
01:05:54,721 --> 01:05:57,758
But what if I did have enough
to get you off the streets?

1141
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,827
At least for a little while.

1142
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:01,129
That'll work too.

1143
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,231
Okay.

1144
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:16,244
Fiesta Town Apartments.

1145
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,612
They're close by to here.

1146
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:21,515
I looked 'em up online
and they seem okay.

1147
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,919
They have
fully furnished apartments.

1148
01:06:24,952 --> 01:06:27,687
You can get a six-month lease,
and that should give you enough time

1149
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:31,792
to get back on your feet,
find a job.

1150
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:36,264
And if you need anything else,
you have my number.

1151
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,099
I'll even go to Goodwill
with you.

1152
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:40,868
We'll get you some blankets,
sheets, kitchen stuff.

1153
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,970
Whatever you need.

1154
01:06:43,004 --> 01:06:45,572
Maybe we'll even find you
a cool shirt like this.

1155
01:06:45,605 --> 01:06:48,810
[chuckling]

1156
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:51,212
I don't know what to say, man.

1157
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:52,947
You don't have to say anything.

1158
01:06:54,015 --> 01:06:55,649
I've been in your shoes before.

1159
01:06:57,317 --> 01:07:00,387
Well, not homeless, but...

1160
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,292
I did hit a string of bad luck
and someone helped me out.

1161
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:06,393
So I'm just paying it forward.

1162
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:09,663
Thanks, man.

1163
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:12,632
We'll have to come back here

1164
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,801
and go to a Cubs game
next season.

1165
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:17,305
Deal.

1166
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:19,472
I look forward to it, Harry.

1167
01:07:19,506 --> 01:07:23,311
- Just don't wear that shirt.
- [chuckling]

1168
01:07:39,526 --> 01:07:40,995
[engine starts]

1169
01:07:41,795 --> 01:07:44,598
I just really don't like that
the money's just in the car.

1170
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:47,500
It's fine.
I parked right out front.

1171
01:07:47,534 --> 01:07:49,669
No one's gonna take it.

1172
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:51,638
I don't know, I really think
you should just

1173
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:54,474
either do the next giveaway
or take it home or something.

1174
01:07:54,507 --> 01:07:56,443
The next giveaway?

1175
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:58,511
- Already?
- Sure. Why not?

1176
01:07:59,546 --> 01:08:01,681
We're gonna be millionaires.

1177
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:04,085
Well, that's the plan.

1178
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,321
All right, how about this?

1179
01:08:07,355 --> 01:08:09,924
I'll take the money home,
hide it...

1180
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:12,994
but leave a little bit out

1181
01:08:13,027 --> 01:08:14,794
so we can go
on a spending spree.

1182
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:18,465
That way, if we get
comfortable having money,

1183
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:19,967
maybe it won't feel as scary.

1184
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:21,035
Hmm.

1185
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:24,071
Yeah, I like that idea.

1186
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:29,043
I like that idea a lot.

I can get used to this.

Are you kidding me? I'm
ready to go back out right now.

01:11:00,227 --> 01:11:02,496
- [groans] Do we have to?
- [laughs]

1226
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,563
Mm-hmm.

1227
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,301
[phone ringing]

1228
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:10,171
- Oh, sorry.
- Who is that?

1229
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:12,173
Eh, it's Emilio.

1230
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:13,706
I should probably get this.

1231
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,412
Hey, man, what's up?

1232
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,482
Um, no...

1233
01:11:22,682 --> 01:11:23,716
Okay.

1234
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,822
All right, man,
I'll see you later.

1235
01:11:27,855 --> 01:11:28,923
Okay.

1236
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:31,292
What was that all about?

1237
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:39,133
It's crazy,
but it might be perfect too.

1238
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:42,369
He's in a real bind.

1239
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:44,637
But... how is that perfect?

1240
01:11:45,906 --> 01:11:49,977
Well, I can help him.

1241
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:56,016
And by helping him,
that could help us big time.

1242
01:11:57,118 --> 01:12:00,121
Okay,
so you're Mr. Riddle man now?

1243
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:01,621
No, sorry, let me explain.

1244
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:04,358
So, when I saw Emilio,
he said that he had a plan

1245
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:06,427
to pay for his mom's
medical bills.

1246
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,627
Okay.

1247
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,930
It turns out that the plan
was to gamble

1248
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:11,098
and win the money.

1249
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:13,267
- Let me guess.
- Exactly.

1250
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,302
He lost, big time.

1251
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:17,471
So what does he want?

1252
01:12:18,606 --> 01:12:20,707
Well, that's the crazy part.

1253
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,877
He needs $100,000.

1254
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,879
Right away, tonight.

1255
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:30,551
Does he need $100,000
for his mom's medical bills

1256
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:33,287
or for like a gambling thing?

1257
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,289
Says he needs it right away.

1258
01:12:35,322 --> 01:12:38,259
I'm assuming the latter,
but I didn't ask.

1259
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,827
I just told him I'd help.

1260
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:43,597
He said he'd pay me back, but...

1261
01:12:43,631 --> 01:12:46,133
I don't think he'll have to
because of the magic.

1262
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:50,971
Wow, this is crazy but perfect.

1263
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:53,641
[chuckling]

1264
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:55,209
Mm!

1265
01:13:01,182 --> 01:13:02,316
Clint?

1266
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:13,494
[trunk beeping]

1267
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:15,095
I'll take that for you, sir.

1268
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:21,669
Welcome aboard, Clint.

1269
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,537
How's your day been so far?

1270
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:26,407
It's been a long day.

1271
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:30,010
At least I didn't have to
kill anyone, so.

1272
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:33,347
[laughs]
Yeah, right, me neither.

1273
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:36,984
I'm kidding.

1274
01:13:37,017 --> 01:13:39,353
You do a lot of these
night shifts for U-Lift?

1275
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,390
Uh, not too many,
but I like the variety,

1276
01:13:43,424 --> 01:13:45,392
so I do them every now and then.

1277
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:47,760
You should be careful.

1278
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:50,931
Crazies come out at night.

1279
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:55,069
Yeah, I know you said that

1280
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,705
you've had a long day,
but are you in a hurry now?

1281
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,039
That depends.

1282
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:01,508
Can you make it worth my while?

1283
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,911
[laughs] Probably not.

1284
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:06,814
I have a buddy
who lives along the way

1285
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,850
and I have a bag
that I need to drop off to him.

1286
01:14:09,883 --> 01:14:12,586
Would you mind if we stopped
on the way?

1287
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,255
Shouldn't be a problem.

1288
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:16,957
Thank you.

1289
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:33,173
You got it?

1290
01:14:34,408 --> 01:14:35,576
Right here.

1291
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,544
The whole amount?

1292
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:39,346
Yeah, just like we talked about.

1293
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:41,682
Seriously, you have no idea
how much this means.

1294
01:14:41,715 --> 01:14:43,617
Listen, I'll...

1295
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:46,786
Listen, I'll pay you back
every cent.

1296
01:14:51,258 --> 01:14:53,227
Why'd you bring somebody,
though?

1297
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,129
Don't you trust me?

1298
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,530
Yeah, of course I do.

1299
01:14:56,563 --> 01:14:58,232
He's just my U-Lift rider.

1300
01:14:58,265 --> 01:14:59,366
Don't worry about it.

1301
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:17,084
See, I told you
that wouldn't take long.

1302
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:19,253
Easy peasy.
In and out.

1303
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:20,954
Bada bing, bada boom.

1304
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,458
Should I ask
what that was about?

1305
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:27,594
Please don't.

1306
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:31,065
I've got a U-Lift driver
who's a spy.

1307
01:15:31,098 --> 01:15:33,267
[chuckling]

1308
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,770
But seriously, I could use
a guy like you.

1309
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:39,640
How'd you like to make
some extra money?

1310
01:15:39,673 --> 01:15:42,676
Um, no, thanks.
Um, I'm good.

1311
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:52,186
I'll grab your bag for you, sir.

1312
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:16,377
For making my ride
entertaining, kid.

1313
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:19,546
Hope to see you around.

- Surprise!
- Oh!

1316
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:50,812
Are you ready to celebrate?

1317
01:16:50,845 --> 01:16:53,547
Well, don't you wanna see

Good as new.

1335
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:47,568
Hey, It's a good thing
Kumar texted you

1336
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:50,237
to let you know
he's coming home tomorrow.

1337
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:53,240
I am so glad that we got
the money last night.

1338
01:17:53,273 --> 01:17:56,510
- We're freakin' millionaires!
- [chuckling] Yeah!

1339
01:17:58,278 --> 01:18:00,981
- [Jeff] Ugh, it's probably my mom again.
- [phone rings]

- Don't worry about it. I'm working.

1343
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:15,395
Who called?

1344
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:17,231
I'm not sure.

1345
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:23,270
[over phone]
<i>Jeff, this is Clint.</i>

1346
01:18:23,303 --> 01:18:26,740
<i>Yeah, you remember giving me
a ride last night.</i>

1347
01:18:26,773 --> 01:18:29,309
<i>You need to give me
my bag back now</i>

1348
01:18:29,343 --> 01:18:31,813
<i>or you're in deep shit!</i>

1349
01:18:31,846 --> 01:18:33,747
What's he talking about?

1350
01:18:34,681 --> 01:18:37,584
I literally have no idea.

1351
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:39,921
He had one bag,
I put it in the hatchback,

1352
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:42,756
and then I gave it back to him
when I dropped him off.

1353
01:18:44,324 --> 01:18:48,161
So you're positive
that you did not switch

1354
01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:51,665
that dude's bag with the giant
bag of money you brought home?

1355
01:18:51,698 --> 01:18:54,535
I mean, the bags
looked similar, but, no, no, no.

1356
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:57,671
- There's no way that I switched 'em.
- All right, Jeff, calm down.

1357
01:18:57,704 --> 01:19:01,009
- Let's figure this out.
- [phone ringing]

1358
01:19:03,912 --> 01:19:05,145
Hello?

1359
01:19:05,178 --> 01:19:07,714
[Clint]
<i>Did you get my message?</i>

1360
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:11,518
- There must be some mistake.
<i>- That's right, and you made it.</i>

1361
01:19:11,552 --> 01:19:13,120
<i>You put my bag in your car.</i>

1362
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:14,822
<i>It had a million dollars in it.</i>

1363
01:19:14,856 --> 01:19:17,959
<i>And now, my money's gone.</i>

1364
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:19,726
But I gave your bag back to you.

1365
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,830
<i>Listen, you little shit!
I'm not fucking around.</i>

1366
01:19:22,864 --> 01:19:26,000
- I didn't do anything.
<i>- Quit lying to me.</i>

1367
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:28,468
<i>You're really starting
to piss me off.</i>

1368
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,304
<i>I know you have my money.</i>

1369
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:33,273
<i>I saw you looking at it
on the security camera.</i>

1370
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:38,478
Well... well,
what if I don't have it?

1371
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:41,748
<i>If you don't have it, then
your little friend Emilio here</i>

1373
01:19:43,952 --> 01:19:47,654
<i>And then I'm coming after you.</i>

1374
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:50,992
<i>I've got Emilio at a warehouse
north of downtown.</i>

1375
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:54,494
<i>I'll text you the address.
Come around back.</i>

<i>Bring me my fucking money
or you're both dead.</i>

<i>You have two hours.</i>

1378
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:05,105
Put Emilio on the phone first.

1379
01:20:05,138 --> 01:20:08,943
- [stammers] If you want your money.
- [Clint laughs]

<i>Playing hardball, are ya?</i>

1381
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:12,455
If you want me
to bring you your money,

1382
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:14,514
I need to know
that Emilio's okay.

<i>you gotta help me.</i>

<i>I don't think he'll last long.</i>

1388
01:20:27,728 --> 01:20:29,630
We've gotta get outta here.

1389
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:31,866
But we can't just leave Emilio.

1390
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:35,069
Did you hear that guy?

1391
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:37,738
Okay, before we do anything,
we have to figure out

1392
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:38,873
why this is happening.

1393
01:20:38,906 --> 01:20:41,375
Everything was going so well.

01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:45,646
Maybe we messed up the magic
when we were cleaning the car?

1395
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:50,183
[ominous music]

1396
01:20:51,919 --> 01:20:53,320
[crickets chirp]

1397
01:21:02,763 --> 01:21:03,998
Ugh!

1398
01:21:06,299 --> 01:21:08,970
[ominous music]

1399
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,019
Sam, where are you?

1400
01:21:25,053 --> 01:21:26,553
I'm right here.

1401
01:21:29,222 --> 01:21:30,791
What the hell?

1402
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:32,960
Just in case.

1403
01:21:32,994 --> 01:21:35,729
- Have you lost your mind?
- No!

1404
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,498
I'm being practical.

1405
01:21:38,532 --> 01:21:40,701
That guy sounds like
a total psycho.

1406
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:43,971
What's to stop him from killing us
both after you give him the money?

1407
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:45,940
Okay, just stop for one second.

1408
01:21:46,874 --> 01:21:48,709
You're right, Clint is a psycho,

1409
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:51,846
but we have to at least try
to save Emilio.

1410
01:21:51,879 --> 01:21:54,614
It's my fault
he got sucked into this anyway.

1411
01:21:54,648 --> 01:21:57,952
And first we have to figure out
why all of this is happening.

1412
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:03,724
Do you recognize this?

1413
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:05,960
Yeah, it was in the car,
next to the console.

1414
01:22:05,993 --> 01:22:08,295
I took it out
while we were cleaning.

1415
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:10,330
Do you have any idea what it is?

1416
01:22:10,363 --> 01:22:11,698
No.

1417
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:17,404
[Jeff] It says that the statue
is the God Shani.

1418
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:21,075
And Shani is the God of Karma.

1419
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:26,747
Yeah, and Shani is the
most powerful of all gods

1420
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,551
and has the power to reward
and to punish.

1421
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:35,990
So, this is the reason
for everything.

1422
01:22:37,758 --> 01:22:40,194
It wasn't
Harry the homeless guy,

1423
01:22:40,228 --> 01:22:42,897
or instant karma,
or even the car.

1424
01:22:44,132 --> 01:22:47,434
It was Shani, the God of Karma.

1425
01:22:49,603 --> 01:22:51,705
[phone ringing]

1426
01:22:51,738 --> 01:22:53,107
[Jeff]
Maybe he got away.

1427
01:22:54,775 --> 01:22:56,743
Emilio?

1428
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:59,746
[Clint] <i>Emilio's a little</i>
<i>under the weather right now.</i>

1429
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:05,619
Clint, you better not
have done anything to him.

1430
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:08,355
He has nothing to do with this.

1431
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:10,925
Okay, it was a mistake,
a misunderstanding.

1432
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:14,061
I'm on my way right now
to make things right.

1433
01:23:14,095 --> 01:23:15,796
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

1434
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:17,965
<i>You have one hour left.</i>

1435
01:23:19,766 --> 01:23:21,635
- I have to go.
- Let me come with you.

1436
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:22,837
No.

1437
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:25,705
I'm not letting you go
by yourself.

1438
01:23:29,177 --> 01:23:32,213
[ominous music]

1439
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:45,159
Should we bring the money?

1440
01:23:47,895 --> 01:23:49,897
I think we should leave it
here for now.

1441
01:23:51,999 --> 01:23:54,801
- [ominous music]
- [garage door creaks]

1442
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:29,270
Emilio!

1443
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:47,955
[ominous music]

1444
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:50,057
[Clint] Well, well, well.

1445
01:24:50,091 --> 01:24:51,558
Hello, Jeff.

1446
01:24:56,663 --> 01:24:59,166
You son of a bitch.
Why are you doing this?

1447
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,368
He didn't do anything!

1448
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,070
You're right.
But you know what?

1449
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:06,207
He had to pay 10% interest
on your loan.

1450
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,508
Which he was unwilling to do

1451
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:11,045
until I applied
a little pressure.

1452
01:25:11,078 --> 01:25:13,347
What the hell is wrong with you?

1453
01:25:13,381 --> 01:25:18,219
Jeff, you stole
my fucking money!

1454
01:25:18,252 --> 01:25:19,820
[gasping]

1455
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,790
Hey,
who's your little friend there?

1456
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:27,460
You leave her out of this.

1457
01:25:29,063 --> 01:25:31,165
Then why the fuck
did you bring her?

1458
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:36,003
You know what?
Don't answer that.

1459
01:25:36,037 --> 01:25:37,470
Glad she's here.

1460
01:25:41,242 --> 01:25:42,509
[Sam] Oh, no!

1461
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:45,913
- No!
- [grunting]

1462
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:11,205
What are you gonna do to us?

1463
01:26:15,575 --> 01:26:17,378
[Clint] Well, it depends.

1464
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,048
Did you bring my money?

1465
01:26:21,082 --> 01:26:22,782
- Oh...
- [Jeff] No.

1466
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:26,387
No?

1467
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,326
No, we didn't bring the money.

1468
01:26:36,696 --> 01:26:37,832
We hid it.

1469
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:40,500
So if you kill us...

1470
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:43,471
you'll never find it.

1471
01:26:43,503 --> 01:26:45,638
- [Emilio grunts]
- [Sam] No, no!

1472
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:47,074
[Jeff] Listen!

1473
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:54,148
We'll trade you the money.

1474
01:26:57,184 --> 01:26:58,518
For our lives.

1475
01:27:00,054 --> 01:27:01,222
All three of us.

1476
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:07,995
So you give me my money
and I let you go.

1477
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:09,330
Is that right?

1478
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:12,099
No.

1479
01:27:14,502 --> 01:27:15,769
You let us go,

1480
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,440
and then
I'll bring you the money.

1481
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,543
[Clint laughing]

1482
01:27:25,312 --> 01:27:27,680
Do you think I'm stupid?

1483
01:27:29,817 --> 01:27:31,185
[Jeff]
No, I don't.

1484
01:27:32,086 --> 01:27:34,021
But I can clearly see
that you're a tough guy,

1485
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:38,459
so I'm appealing
to your sense of fair play.

1486
01:27:40,327 --> 01:27:41,862
Just give us a chance.

1487
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,265
I promise,

1488
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,566
if you let us go,

1489
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:51,372
I will promise that you get
your money.

1490
01:27:51,405 --> 01:27:52,907
Fair play?

1491
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,911
You want me to trust you
after you stole my money?

1492
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,883
[laughs] Okay, sure.

1493
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:04,651
Tell you what I'll do.

1494
01:28:08,422 --> 01:28:09,990
On one piece of paper

1495
01:28:11,358 --> 01:28:13,494
I'll write "Let you go."

1496
01:28:21,435 --> 01:28:22,735
And on the other...

1497
01:28:23,904 --> 01:28:25,139
"Kill you."

1498
01:28:39,386 --> 01:28:42,022
And you pick
which piece of paper.

1499
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:45,459
That way, you decide
what I do to you.

1500
01:28:46,726 --> 01:28:48,195
Now choose one.

1501
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:54,502
Untie me first.

1502
01:28:56,237 --> 01:29:00,074
Okay, but no funny business.

1503
01:29:00,107 --> 01:29:01,674
[snaps fingers]

1504
01:29:12,419 --> 01:29:15,156
All right, you...
But you have to promise

1505
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:16,656
to be a man of your word.

1506
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:20,727
If I choose the one
that says "Let you go,"

1507
01:29:22,263 --> 01:29:23,631
you have to let us go.

1508
01:29:25,499 --> 01:29:30,337
Oh, Jeff, I cross my heart
and hope to die.

1509
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,730
What are you doing?

1510
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,936
You said that you wrote
"Kill you"

1511
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:04,038
and "Let you go" on the papers,
right?

1512
01:30:05,306 --> 01:30:07,740
Well, let's see
which one's left...

1513
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,344
and we'll know what I chose.

1514
01:30:11,312 --> 01:30:12,913
You little shit!

1515
01:30:16,749 --> 01:30:19,153
It looks like I chose the one
that said "Let you go,"

1516
01:30:19,186 --> 01:30:21,455
so you have to let us go.

1517
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:25,392
[Clint]
I'm not letting you go!

1518
01:30:25,426 --> 01:30:29,729
- Don't let them get away!
- [muffled shouting]

1519
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:34,034
[Clint]
I'll be back for you later.

1520
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:39,139
[engine starts]

1521
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:42,309
[tires screech]

1522
01:30:42,343 --> 01:30:43,911
Go, go, go, go!

1523
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:46,714
[dramatic music]

1524
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:54,221
- [Jeff] You see 'em?
- Yes, I see them!

1525
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:01,228
- They're still there.
- Shit.

1526
01:31:01,262 --> 01:31:03,230
[tires squeal]

1527
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:09,436
[Clint] Keep close.

1528
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:10,604
Step on it.

1529
01:31:13,474 --> 01:31:16,010
- Can we go any faster?
- I'm trying! I...

1530
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:17,678
Let's go, catch up.

1531
01:31:21,415 --> 01:31:24,318
- You're driving like your mom!
- Oh, my God.

1532
01:31:26,453 --> 01:31:28,956
- I'll go up there.
- Take it. Take it, take it!

1533
01:31:43,137 --> 01:31:44,972
I don't even know
where this goes.

1534
01:31:48,809 --> 01:31:52,279
- [Sam] No, no, no, no.
- [Jeff] Shit. Uh...

1535
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:54,815
- It's okay, just turn around.
- Yeah.

1536
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:06,060
[Jeff] Oh, my God,
I think we lost 'em.

1537
01:32:06,093 --> 01:32:07,728
[Sam]
Where are they?

1538
01:32:09,763 --> 01:32:11,565
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!
What do we do?

1539
01:32:11,598 --> 01:32:13,967
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Sam, run!

1540
01:32:15,002 --> 01:32:16,236
[Sam grunts]

1541
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:23,844
Come on.

1542
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:26,180
[gunshots]

1543
01:32:35,856 --> 01:32:37,891
There's nowhere left to go.

1544
01:32:42,363 --> 01:32:44,365
That was a good one back there...

1545
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:46,200
Eating the fucking paper.

1546
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,736
I didn't see that coming.

1547
01:32:49,737 --> 01:32:52,439
But now your time is up.

1548
01:32:53,842 --> 01:32:56,610
If you both come out
with your hands up,

1549
01:32:56,643 --> 01:32:58,746
I might let one of you go.

1550
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:21,034
Okay.

1551
01:33:21,836 --> 01:33:22,970
Coming out.

1552
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:32,579
[Jeff]
Don't shoot.

1553
01:33:37,551 --> 01:33:40,387
- [grunts]
- Oh!

1554
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:42,756
Where's my money?

1555
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:46,093
[cocking gun] -Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

1556
01:33:47,194 --> 01:33:52,366
Jeff, if we just... we just tell
him where it is, it'll be... it'll be...

1557
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:53,934
He's gonna let us go, right?

1558
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:58,572
- Right?
- Okay. [groaning]

1559
01:33:59,874 --> 01:34:01,141
Okay.

1560
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:03,878
Okay, I'll...

1561
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:05,679
- I'll tell you where it is.
- Where is it?

1562
01:34:05,712 --> 01:34:07,916
[groans]
It's in the car.

1563
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:10,784
Let's go!

1564
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:13,153
Show me!

1565
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:16,891
- It's in the back of the car.
- I said let's go!

1566

[groaning]

1567
01:34:30,471 --> 01:34:32,272
Here.

1568
01:34:32,306 --> 01:34:33,842
That wasn't so hard.

1569
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:50,023
- [engine starting]

1570
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:16,316

01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:30,330
Can you pop the trunk, please?

01:35:31,365 --> 01:35:33,600
[trunk beeping]

1573
01:35:33,634 --> 01:35:34,836
You okay with this, sir?

1574
01:35:34,869 --> 01:35:37,070
[businessman] Yeah,
it should be fun.

01:35:55,023 --> 01:35:56,523
First ride share, huh?

Yes, sir.

1578
01:35:58,993 --> 01:36:01,029
What kind of work do you do?

1579
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:04,464
I used to sell books online.

1580
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:07,367
Now I sell
just about everything.

1581
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:11,438
I've probably bought
something from you... before.

1582
01:36:17,177 --> 01:36:18,947
Let me help you
with your bag, sir.

[businessman] Thank you.

1586
01:36:30,624 --> 01:36:33,895

- [businessman] It's not mine.
