1
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,043
That was refreshing.

2
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,971
I'm refreshed.

3
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,875
I'm refreshing.

4
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,999
Welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel.

5
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,836
- And I'm Anne Howard.
- Good stuff today.

6
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,502
- We're going to be busy.
- We've got pop superstar Elton John.

7
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,578
He's going to be with us.

8
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,613
And so, too,
will best-selling author Al Franken.

9
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,579
Along with some
super-smart fourth graders...

10
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,514
with a great idea
for getting schoolbooks...

11
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,915
to kids who really need them.

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,453
But here's an idea
whose time has come.

13
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,545
Why don't we just start with...

14
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:08,983
...and fill the tart shell.

15
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,690
Bryant, you put some ice cream
on our angel food cake...

16
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,700
- How much do you want?
- As much as you like.

17
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,913
What are you laughing about?
This is Baked Alaska.

18
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,492
- This is supposed to be low-fat.
- It is!

19
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,787
Did they call?

20
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,487
Someone from the show.
The Gumbel show. They didn't call?

21
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,895
Are you sure?

22
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,002
- Once again, we're out of time.
- Thank you. Already?

23
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,834
We still got lots more ahead
this morning. We're going to be back...

24
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,997
- What's up, dude?
- Next person in line.

25
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,230
What's up?

26
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,638
- Hey, can I get your autograph?
- Next in line.

27
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,471
I'm not who you think I am, so...

28
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,638
You're not the weather guy?

29
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,046
Dan Spritz?

30
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,408
Dave Spritz.

31
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,578
I'm not Dave Spritz, no.
But I hear that a lot.

32
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,654
You don't have to be a dick.

33
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:56,495
Look, can you just...
All right, I'm just waiting in line.

34
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,069
Bro, I can read
your vehicle registration form.

35
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,374
So, whatever.

36
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,703
Can you...

37
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,740
All right, can you give me a break?
I just wanted to wait in line.

38
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,816
You're on TV, bro.

39
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,155
You're on TV.

40
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,452
- You're on TV, bro.
- So what? You keep saying that.

41
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,653
So you're on TV, bro.

42
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,059
Go work in a bank or something...

43
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,461
if you don't wanna be cool to people.

44
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,227
Whatever. Just...
Can you get out of my face?

45
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,068
Can you get out of my face?

46
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,708
- Asshole.
- You want to say that to my face?

47
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,272
I thought you wanted me
to get out of your face.

48
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,313
People recognize me sometimes.

49
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,243
Some are dicks.

50
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,857
This is the same system that created
those strong snowfalls in Minnesota.

51
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,426
It's meant some
slightly warmer weather...

52
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,620
I should cool out a little, I guess.

53
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,426
I mean, I'm not just this
two-dimensional guy they recognize.

54
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,899
I do have a relationship to them.

55
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,662
I let them know
what they have to deal with.

56
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,570
But listen, these warmer temperatures
are not going to last.

57
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,838
This wind system will keep pushing
colder air across the Midwest...

58
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,072
I guess that's why
they think they know me.

59
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,408
But they don't, really.

60
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,678
...our Spritz Nipper of the week
with a high of just 24.

61
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,387
I'm not a hill of beans.

62
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,879
I have a plan.

63
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,551
Okay, see you then.

64
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,919
- What's this afternoon?
- You're picking up Shelly.

65
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,518
- Where?
- Chicago Dance.

66
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,393
Then you're taking your dad
to Northwestern.

67
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,466
At 3:00?

68
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,101
Do you have that Hello America stuff?

69
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,669
- The letter?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,933
You have Mike, too.
5:30 at the Norris house.

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,007
Okay.

72
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,092
Do they have my cell phone?

73
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,254
Well, they should have
all the numbers in case.

74
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,326
And am I supposed to call
that guy Dersen?

75
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,128
Didn't he want me to call to touch base?

76
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,661
Okay.

77
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,165
- Dad, can we stop here?
- What for?

78
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,367
I need a notebook for school.

79
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,311
I'll just walk home.

80
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,074
Okay.

81
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,148
- Can I have some money?
- You don't have any?

82
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,281
No.

83
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,416
You're 12 years old.

84
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,962
You shouldn't be walking around
without money, okay, Shelly?

85
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,496
You're not a kid.

86
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,032
- How's your mom doing?
- She's good.

87
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,703
Can I have a pack of Lights?

88
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,108
- Regulars?
- The 100s.

89
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,507
Strikes?

90
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,809
How's Shelly?

91
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,416
She's doing great.

92
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,443
- Little angel.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,843
She's doing great.

94
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,821
- Who's an angel?
- Shelly.

95
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,924
Shelly is grossly overweight
and unhappy.

96
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,064
I'm concerned about her,
as I am Michael.

97
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,433
- David.
- Yeah, Dad.

98
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,226
Robert Spritzel?

99
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,470
Would you get me a paper...

100
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,595
- for the way back, Son?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,967
Fifteen minutes?

102
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,374
Yes. I'll see you then.

103
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,610
Fuck.

104
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,348
- Hey.
- Hey.

105
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,121
- It's getting cold.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,424
- What's the Nipper this week?
- Thursday.

107
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,556
Thursday's the Nipper? All right.

108
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,143
Here.

109
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,076
Yeah, can I get some change?

110
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,874
Not really.

111
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,778
Can I just get some quarters?
I just need a quarter for a paper.

112
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,217
Not really.

113
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,315
All right. I'll get something then.

114
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,318
All right.

115
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,698
Small coffee.

116
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,729
It's 80 cents.

117
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,561
No, it says $0.72.

118
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,705
After the whole everything, it's $0.80.

119
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,507
- Hey.
- Hi.

120
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,551
Where's the paper, David?

121
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,278
I didn't have enough money.

122
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,783
You bought a coffee.

123
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,048
- What?
- You bought a coffee.

124
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,424
Yeah, that, and then I didn't have
enough money after.

125
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,122
What?

126
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,899
I didn't have enough money
after I bought the coffee, so...

127
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,673
You should carry more than $1, David.

128
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,265
You're a grown man.

129
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,240
Let me just move this letter
from Hello America.

130
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,117
My father is Robert King Spritzel.

131
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,514
He won the National Book Award
when he was 28.

132
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,123
And the Pulitzer when he was 33.

133
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,856
President Carter called him
a national treasure.

134
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,432
They played racquetball
in a regular game.

135
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,195
He was a great writer.

136
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,331
But what was the cost?

137
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,006
Did he neglect his family?

138
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,473
No, he didn't.

139
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,805
He was a fine father.

140
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,073
More than that, really.

141
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,240
It's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing.

142
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,912
She should find another interest
that would be more rewarding to her...

143
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,483
that she can take more from, David.

144
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,958
- We've talked about that.
- Well, you should do something, Son.

145
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,360
We've tried a couple things.
We'll keep trying, so...

146
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,491
How's Michael?

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,262
I think that was an overreaction
on Noreen's part.

148
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,031
I don't think he has a problem with pot.

149
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,802
Let's hope.

150
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,734
How's the weather business?

151
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,316
Last September...

152
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:07,449
I had encouraged Shelly to explore
some other activities and interests.

153
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,927
She picked archery.

154
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,594
So I took her to an archery range
in Bolingbrook.

155
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,268
It was a 90-minute drive.

156
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:15,734
It was a 90-minute drive.

157
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,438
We purchased a junior bow-arrow kit...

158
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,734
and a leather wrist/forearm guard.

159
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,673
Okay, we'll take that.

160
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,611
And private lessons.

161
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,149
All right, Shelly.

162
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,086
You take that one...

163
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,320
and go right ahead.

164
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,366
All right. Okay, just remember...

165
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,665
pull it straight back,
parallel to your ear, okay?

166
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,763
You can do it, Shelly.

167
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,548
We purchased a five-pack lesson plan.

168
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,646
We haven't been back.

169
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,318
Hello?

170
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,726
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,863
Can you pick up Mike
at the mall on North?

172
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,068
I thought he was at a friend's house.
Paul Norris.

173
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,263
They went to the mall.
He just called me.

174
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,704
- He finished his rehab.
- Okay.

175
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,578
- That's one of my counselors.
- In your program?

176
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,549
Don Boden. He's pretty nice.

177
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,922
- He swears all the time, though.
- Swears?

178
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,151
Yeah. To relate, I guess.
But he's pretty nice.

179
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,663
Hey, Don.

180
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,672
- What are you guys doing?
- Looking for clothes.

181
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,175
You're just looking for clothes.

182
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,139
- Yeah.
- That's great.

183
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,913
I'm looking for clothes.

184
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:12,873
Okay.

185
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,614
- This is Paul.
- What's up?

186
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,688
Hey.

187
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,683
It's cold today.

188
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,487
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no kidding.

189
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,425
What is it, like, 20 or something?

190
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,723
Yeah, like 22.

191
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,225
Yeah. Fuck.

192
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,300
Yeah.

193
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,037
Hey.

194
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,801
- Yeah, I like this.
- It's good-looking.

195
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,035
Yeah, I've been looking
for something like this.

196
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,475
Chuck it in here.

197
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,114
- What?
- Chuck it in.

198
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,049
I'm loading up. I got a discount card.
I'll get it for you.

199
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,950
- That's all right.
- Mike, big deal.

200
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,751
- I can get it.
- Bro, I got a serious discount.

201
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,916
It's gonna cost, like, $7.

202
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,428
- I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

203
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,974
That's my dad. I'll see you later.

204
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,871
Sure. I'll catch you later.

205
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,789
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,155
- Who's that?
- Don Boden.

207
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,528
- Who's Don Boden?
- He's one of my counselors.

208
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,597
Oh.

209
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,130
- That's a nice sweater.
- Thanks.

210
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,710
I'll walk you up.

211
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,846
Hi.

212
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,383
Hi. Thanks for getting Mike.

213
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,053
- Hey, how was your thing?
- It was good.

214
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,130
- I'll see you, Dad.
- Okay, Mike.

215
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,162
- I think he's gonna be okay.
- Well, we'll see.

216
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,970
What's new?

217
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,705
Nothing much.

218
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,308
I got a feeler from Hello America.

219
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,277
- What?
- I got a feeler.

220
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,209
Dales is leaving it.
I might get called to audition.

221
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,614
New York.

222
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,951
- Lf I get called.
- That's good.

223
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,725
What about the kids?

224
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,857
It's just a shot in the dark, that's all.

225
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,425
Well, thanks for getting Mike.

226
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,566
I had to take my dad
to Northwestern for a test...

227
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,762
so I was right there, anyway.

228
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,997
- Oh, is he okay?
- I think so. It was just a test.

229
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,878
Noreen!

230
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,586
Are you okay?

231
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,892
Yeah.

232
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,725
Fuck! What are you doing?

233
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,800
I was just... You turned into it.

234
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,266
I think you cracked the glass.

235
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,945
So do you have everything you need?

236
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,383
Yeah, we got everything.

237
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,455
We'll pare it down to three applicants
after we watch the tapes.

238
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,786
- We'll call if you're one, Dave.
- Okay, Mark.

239
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,484
It's nice to make your acquaintance.

240
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,925
- You, too. Take care.
- Hey, weatherman!

241
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,086
All right. Bye.

242
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,163
Fuck!

243
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,034
Fuck.

244
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,268
David?

245
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,336
Hey.

246
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,669
- What happened?
- I got hit with a Frosty.

247
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,969
- Why?
- What?

248
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,968
Why did you get hit with a Frosty?
What is a Frosty?

249
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,642
A Frosty is a shake from Wendy's.

250
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,113
Why would someone throw
a shake at you?

251
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,459
- That happens sometimes.
- People throw shakes at you?

252
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,028
Stuff. People throw stuff
at me sometimes...

253
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,964
- if they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

254
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,591
- If they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

255
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,996
From TV.

256
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,533
But you just read the weather.

257
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,368
Well, I predict it.

258
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,001
You don't have a degree in meteorology.

259
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,475
I make suppositions, or I...

260
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,803
What are you doing?

261
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,939
- I walked over.
- You walked? It's freezing.

262
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,685
I have lymphoma, David.

263
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,445
What?

264
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,223
I have lymphoma.

265
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,487
- Doctor Pritch called.
- What?

266
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,629
I was having tremors.
That's the reason that I went in.

267
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,134
Pritch read my scans.

268
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,028
- What's the prognosis?
- Well, it's not good.

269
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:05,074
We'll talk about it this week.
I wanted to tell you.

270
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,533
Yeah.

271
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,046
I'll call you
after I've talked to Pritch again.

272
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,420
I'll drive you home.

273
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,218
I like the fresh air.

274
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,055
- Well, I'll walk back with you.
- No, that's okay.

275
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,288
Okay.

276
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,549
Every couple months,
someone throws something at me...

277
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,621
a shake, a burrito once.

278
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,758
Why? My name, partly, I guess.

279
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,160
I changed it for professional reasons.

280
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,991
My first station manager suggested it.

281
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:06,833
He said it sounded refreshing
and that they wanted that quality.

282
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,466
That may be true, but it's also annoying.
I know that.

283
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,277
What kind of name is Spritz?

284
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,611
It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name.

285
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,847
He's bullshit.

286
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,416
Well, I like him. He's handsome.

287
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,519
He's an asshole.

288
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,092
I don't like his face.

289
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,222
His asshole face.

290
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,092
The other thing, my job is very easy.

291
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,429
Two hours a day,
basically reading prompts.

292
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,474
I make $240,000 a year...

293
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,043
plus appearances...

294
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:51,310
which are, you know,
not comfortable for me...

295
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,616
but lucrative.

296
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,853
"Four score and seven years ago...

297
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,722
"our fathers brought forth,
on this continent..."

298
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,836
Also, it makes other things easy,
being on TV.

299
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,036
Everything's easy.

300
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,534
Yeah!

301
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,749
I receive a large reward for pretty much
zero effort and contribution.

302
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,355
The shakes and stuff
are a reaction to that, I think.

303
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,209
What must you think of me?

304
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,135
Your family-leaver.

305
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,978
Your non-meteorologist,
yet weatherman...

306
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,515
frosty-taking, fuck-happy son.

307
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,452
Don't die yet, Robert.
Give me time to get it together.

308
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,217
Give me a little while.

309
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,761
Let me get the Hello America job.
I can get it together.

310
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,687
Two for High Water.

311
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,991
- I got mine, Don.
- No, it's cool. I got it.

312
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,191
Thanks.

313
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,117
Tricia's a bitch.

314
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,552
She's a little cunt.

315
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,057
I hate that little cunt.

316
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,562
I'd like to burn her.

317
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,068
Hi.

318
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,412
Hi.

319
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,205
Today's the company party.
I thought I'd take the kids.

320
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,285
Oh.

321
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,414
Well, Mike is out.

322
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,587
- Shelly's home?
- She's walking Jackson.

323
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,222
- Where do you want to take them?
- The rink. WCH.

324
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,131
Hey.

325
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,035
Hey.

326
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,894
What?

327
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,702
Dave.

328
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,404
Hey, Tim.

329
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,608
- I didn't know you were coming.
- I always come to these...

330
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,282
when I can.

331
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,888
I have some time this week if you want
to go back up to Bolingbrook.

332
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,826
- What's in Bolingbrook?
- Sportsman's. The archery range.

333
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,829
- Okay.
- Okay? You wanna go?

334
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,056
Okay, I remember it.

335
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,728
Well, do you wanna go back up?

336
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,768
Sometimes.

337
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,917
What's gonna happen?

338
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,975
What?

339
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,345
What are we gonna do here?

340
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,356
Great stuff.

341
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,562
Ladies and gentlemen, on your marks!

342
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,972
Let's go team Spritz!

343
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,500
Get set!

344
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,470
Go!

345
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,715
Go! Go! Go!

346
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,615
- Just keep up, Shell. Come on.
- I'm trying to.

347
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,908
We should finish.

348
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,077
We're last. We're way last.

349
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,513
There's a lesson here. Let's finish.

350
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,809
I'm hurt.

351
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,511
Hon, you can do it.
You can finish. Okay?

352
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,146
I don't want you to quit.
It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay?

353
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,681
All right.

354
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,784
Let's go.

355
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,929
That's my girl. That's it.

356
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,955
Good. I'm proud of you.

357
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,599
Okay?

358
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,509
Yay! That was great!

359
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,137
Hon. Hon, you okay?

360
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,606
You shouldn't have made me finish!

361
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,241
That was like 100 yards
you made me go.

362
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,913
I'm not a football-jocker.

363
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,787
What happened?

364
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,056
Just... We got tangled up in a sack.

365
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,223
- What happened?
- She tore her ACL.

366
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,426
These fucking crutches are too long!

367
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,230
- What did you say?
- Shelly!

368
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,100
- Well, what were you doing?
- It was a picnic.

369
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,041
- And she tore something?
- ACL. MCL.

370
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,339
Which?

371
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,706
Both.

372
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,045
- Dave!
- Well, we didn't go bungee jumping!

373
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,914
It was a fucking potato-sack race!

374
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,180
- That's where she got it.
- What?

375
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,256
"Fucking" this. "Fucking" that.

376
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,018
No, I never said that around her.

377
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,959
You don't know you have, Dave,
because you don't pay attention!

378
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,960
Fuck that.

379
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,857
What?

380
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,628
- Just fuck that, Noreen. You know...
- Dave.

381
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,397
- What?
- Step back.

382
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,806
- Step back?
- Step back.

383
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,369
What are you talking about, Russ?

384
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,808
- Russ...
- Step back right now.

385
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,877
- Fuck you, right now.
- Fuck you, Spritz.

386
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,016
Fuck you, fat asshole!

387
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,677
Dildo!

388
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,550
David, what are you doing?

389
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,783
I'm talking to my wife!
I'm talking to Noreen...

390
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,620
and this clown,
whose business this isn't.

391
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,286
You call me a dildo,
it is my business, Spritz.

392
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,888
You are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker!

393
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,391
Stop, Son.

394
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,758
Would you?

395
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,336
Why don't you go?

396
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,701
Why are you here? Are you okay?

397
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,775
I came to talk to Noreen.

398
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,339
Dave, come on. I will talk to you later.

399
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,149
- Dave, what's going on, Son?
- It's nothing. Just...

400
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,087
Why are you here, anyway?

401
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,785
I came to talk to Noreen
about an issue concerning Shelly.

402
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:20,063
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm her parent, too. So? What?

403
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,232
Shelly dresses in clothing
not appropriate for her...

404
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,059
clinging stuff.

405
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,705
All kids wear...
Dad, it's a different generation.

406
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,210
They call her camel toe.

407
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,372
- What?
- Are you aware of that?

408
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:37,915
What?

409
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
That her colleagues call her camel toe.

410
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:41,982
What are you talking about?

411
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,884
It means the crease in her vagina...

412
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,287
that they can discern
through her clothing.

413
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,018
- What?
- Camel toe.

414
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,822
Yeah, I heard you.
I mean, how do you know they do that?

415
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,055
I heard it.

416
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:57,227
I picked Shelly up on Wednesday,
heard taunting, the older boys calling it.

417
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,565
- You might have heard wrong.
- No, I heard camel...

418
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,104
Okay, okay, look. I'll deal.

419
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,696
I want to get her through this ACL thing.

420
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,899
I'm gonna take her shooting.

421
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,033
I'm gonna reapply her there.

422
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,475
I'm gonna get her talking to me.
I'm gonna get to her...

423
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,547
and I'm gonna work it out.

424
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,796
A camel toe is pretty much
what Robert said it was.

425
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,974
It's basically just when you
can make out more than you should.

426
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,437
But it's the kind of thing...

427
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,242
She's 12, you know?

428
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,212
If you're around and paying attention,
you catch it...

429
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:51,255
then name-calling doesn't start,
and maybe smoking doesn't start.

430
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,658
And maybe she can just stay
a happy kid for a couple more years.

431
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,792
She shouldn't be unhappy.

432
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:02,526
Fuck. What did she ever do
to anybody? Shelly.

433
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:14,707
- Hello.
- Hey.

434
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,011
Hey.

435
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,309
Listen.

436
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,744
Noreen, I was thinking...

437
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,410
this pushing and pulling...

438
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,054
the tug-of-war we do sometimes...

439
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,355
it's not good for the kids.

440
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,551
It's not.

441
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,290
Noreen, let's see somebody.
Work it out. Let's...

442
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,990
- Fuck!
- Asshole!

443
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,728
Are you okay?

444
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,266
- I got hit with a pop!
- What?

445
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,734
A fucking...

446
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,975
A Big Gulp.

447
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,441
- Man.
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

448
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,676
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So...

449
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,612
what I was saying...

450
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,182
See somebody?

451
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,589
We're going to begin
with some trust-building exercises.

452
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,390
The Buddy Drop. Up on your feet.
Let's go.

453
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,529
Dave, Noreen. Center circle.

454
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,463
Okay.

455
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,838
Now, Noreen,
you're just gonna let yourself go...

456
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,542
and Dave is gonna catch you.

457
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,906
- Just go back?
- Yeah. Cross your arms up front.

458
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,711
- Now?
- Whenever you're ready.

459
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,077
Okay.

460
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,224
Good. Very good.

461
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,752
All right, Teresa, Mark. You're up.

462
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,987
Okay.

463
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,364
Now I want you to name something...

464
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,633
that you did that affected your partner...

465
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,098
and that you're not proud of.

466
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,776
I had this thing with porno
on the computer, sort of.

467
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,210
I got a little preoccupied...

468
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,942
Actually, I want you to write it down,
not say it.

469
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,017
Okay.

470
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,814
I want you to put it on the paper
that you got for a reason.

471
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,888
Okay.

472
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:10,019
Now make sure it's something
the other person doesn't know about...

473
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,157
that they don't know.

474
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,938
All right.

475
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,340
Then you are going to give it
to the other person...

476
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,179
and the other person
is never going to look at it.

477
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,706
Ever.

478
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,019
That's trust.

479
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:04,940
What's up?

480
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,426
I thought Dave's science-fiction novel,
or whatever it was...

481
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,998
was stupid and sucked...

482
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,067
and was a waste of time.

483
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,137
It was embarrassing. Four years?

484
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,314
Well, I thought that went pretty well.

485
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,248
Yeah.

486
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,838
It wasn't science fiction,
just so you know.

487
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,775
- What?
- It wasn't science fiction.

488
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,511
- What are you talking about?
- Did you even read it?

489
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,980
No. One of the side characters
was a scientist...

490
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,608
- but that's not even important...
- God damn it, Dave. God damn it!

491
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,552
What? I'm just asking,
did you ever even read it?

492
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,385
It was hard to read.
It was poorly written.

493
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,826
You're an asshole. God.

494
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,752
You are a champion asshole.

495
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,491
You're a real blue-ribbon fuck!

496
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,036
I just wanna make it work, Noreen.

497
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:38,268
I just want to know everything,
so I can make it work. That's why I...

498
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,405
- I want to try again.
- I'm not going back. You fucked it up.

499
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,507
I mean, our marriage.

500
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,974
What?

501
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,622
I want to try again.

502
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,054
Fuck you.

503
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,992
You know, Dave, you can't even...

504
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,891
You looked at it. That's dishonest.
It's crappy.

505
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,594
- Noreen.
- Hey, should I look at yours?

506
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,132
That's all right.

507
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,705
No. No, no, Noreen...

508
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:13,175
"Throughout marriage
BJs lacked enthusiasm.

509
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,308
"Had difference of opinion
over how important that was.

510
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,745
"I thought very."

511
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,080
You know what, Dave?

512
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,256
You want to know
why my BJs lacked enthusiasm?

513
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,687
I hated you.

514
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,227
I hated your hair.

515
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,728
I hated your ugly legs, your forearms.

516
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,397
I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay?

517
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,564
And that's why I lacked enthusiasm
when your cock was in my mouth.

518
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,137
Hey, hon.

519
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,805
Shelly, it's cold.

520
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:54,384
Your father said it was going to be
65 degrees today, but...

521
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,283
Go ahead. I'll see you later.

522
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,922
How did it go?

523
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,516
Good.

524
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,630
I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in.

525
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,510
Did you start my novel yet?

526
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,977
What's that?

527
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,215
Breaking Point. Did you start that?

528
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,251
No, I haven't yet, Son.
I've been preoccupied.

529
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,493
Well, that's good, actually.

530
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,659
I want to make some changes, so...

531
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,503
I'll give you the new one.

532
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,351
What did he say?

533
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,681
It's further bad news.

534
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,726
The metastatic plane
was too wide for radiation.

535
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,588
He suggested I see a Dr. Frost
in New York for clinical trials.

536
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,512
I got a feeler from Hello America.

537
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,976
National.

538
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,176
They're looking at 20 guys, but
they'll be cutting down to three soon.

539
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,981
It's a possibility.

540
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,818
The salary's great. It's real strong.

541
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,152
It would mean moving...

542
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,560
but I'd like to move everybody,
you know?

543
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,632
Renew things with Noreen.

544
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,068
We've been seeing somebody.

545
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:56,598
Let the kids start over in New York.

546
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,003
Keep them away from some
of the bad influences here that...

547
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,977
Just get a fresh start.

548
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,779
I think that would be great.

549
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,777
- That would be terrific.
- Yeah.

550
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:14,020
You could rededicate yourselves,
knuckle down.

551
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,166
What's this?

552
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,103
It's a Big Gulp.

553
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,316
You should say,
"We might see some snow...

554
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,579
"but it might shift south, miss us."

555
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,984
I can say it,
but I sort of wanna understand it.

556
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,216
Why is it?

557
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,927
Well, it's Canadian trade winds.

558
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,026
Behind all of it?

559
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,927
Yeah, this will get pushed by wind
out of Canada.

560
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,398
- So what's it gonna do?
- I don't know.

561
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,033
It's a guess.

562
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,440
It's wind, man. Blows all over the place.

563
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,471
For some reason...

564
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,307
I don't know.

565
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,249
I went back to Bolingbrook.

566
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,645
I bought a three-month lesson plan.

567
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,981
Hang on.
Before you do that, you know...

568
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,649
let's go out here
and do a little stretching exercises.

569
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,747
You got to rotate your...

570
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,417
We warm up...

571
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,191
then do basic focus drills,
stuff you never think about.

572
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,097
Like closing an eye
without moving your face...

573
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,194
because your face
is the anchor point for your hand...

574
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,573
that allows you to focus.

575
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:43,669
You have to keep your triangle
against a lot of force.

576
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,227
We do draws for a half hour,
then releases.

577
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,334
That's called "loosing,"
when you release.

578
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,079
Great shot! All right!

579
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:28,989
It's hard...

580
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,890
but that one good shot
leaves you thinking...

581
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,986
you might be catching on.

582
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,760
Do you lift weights?

583
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,461
- What's that?
- Do you lift weights?

584
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:39,825
Yeah.

585
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,466
- Cardio?
- Yeah, you have to do both.

586
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,030
Yeah.

587
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,611
Are you on any kind of a program?

588
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,341
Yeah, our gym coach
gave us a program.

589
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,681
- That should be good.
- Yeah.

590
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,644
Yeah.

591
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,717
Fuck.

592
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,791
Hey.

593
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,260
- You know what would be interesting?
- What?

594
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:07,456
We should take some pictures.
Some shots, like...

595
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,790
some now,
some in a month or whatever...

596
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,891
see if you're making gains.

597
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,003
Yeah.

598
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,696
I've got my mom's Nikon.

599
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,672
- Whip your shirt off.
- Whip my shirt off?

600
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,136
Yeah.

601
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,854
You're shredded.

602
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,628
This is great, man.

603
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,361
We can compare this shit.

604
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,069
That's a Nikon FM?

605
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,167
Well, yeah.
You know something about cameras?

606
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,672
Yeah. I took a class at Parker.

607
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,638
A couple more.

608
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,515
My dad's gonna get the F3 for me...

609
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,249
if I can finish the program
and maintain a B average.

610
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,815
It's like a $600 camera.
I'm psyched about it.

611
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,890
I could loan that to you.

612
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,521
Yeah?

613
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,064
I could loan that shit to you if...

614
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,494
you wanted it earlier.

615
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:20,962
Okay.

616
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,246
This is gonna go a lot better.

617
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,345
Why?

618
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,079
Because I got you some bobtail arrows.
They're easier.

619
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,616
Why?

620
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,217
Well, they're thicker at the ends.

621
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,986
See? They taper toward the nock.

622
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,459
- What's the nock?
- The arrow end.

623
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,259
- What was I using before?
- Chested arrows.

624
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,794
That guy didn't know
what he was doing.

625
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,371
Okay.

626
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,105
Fletch it.

627
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,848
- What?
- Fix your arrow in.

628
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,149
That's the term.

629
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:12,479
Arrow makers were called fletchers.
That's where the last name came from.

630
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,115
Here. There's a little bit of a...

631
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,596
It takes a little while.
Right there, right below the nock.

632
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,258
There!

633
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,026
Awesome!

634
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,136
Okay, let's loose a few.

635
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,239
Let's show our stuff.

636
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,666
Aim about a half-foot above.

637
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,039
- Okay.
- You wait till you're steady.

638
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,605
- Are you aligned?
- Yeah.

639
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,547
Okay. Let it go.

640
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:42,944
Fuck!

641
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,146
Come on, Shelly. Get your arrow.

642
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,120
We probably didn't home long enough.

643
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:51,752
That's the pause between drawing back
and firing.

644
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,164
Let's pause a little longer.

645
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,928
What?

646
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:00,834
Nothing.

647
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,467
- Are you just not interested?
- Yeah.

648
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,005
Yeah, you're not interested?
Or, yeah, you are interested?

649
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,706
Yeah, I'm not. Really.

650
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,687
What was it you liked?
Let's think of it that way.

651
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,283
What?

652
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,057
What interested you
when you thought about archery?

653
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,490
When you wanted to do it.

654
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,797
I don't know.
Going hunting or something.

655
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,130
Hunting?

656
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,638
Yeah.

657
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,565
- For animals?
- Yeah.

658
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,509
You wanna shoot animals with arrows?

659
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,477
- Yeah.
- You do?

660
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,644
Yeah, to kill them.

661
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,816
But that's not archery. That's hunting.

662
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,116
That's called bowhunting.
That's what you wanted to do?

663
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,920
- Bowhunting?
- Yeah, I saw it on TV.

664
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,663
Well, I don't really wanna kill animals
with arrows...

665
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,290
so that's not going to happen.
We can target shoot, Shelly.

666
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,460
- It's not fun.
- It's a lot of fun.

667
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:09,095
- You have to apply yourself.
- Targets don't move.

668
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,935
Well, you know, Shelly...

669
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,440
you haven't really hit one yet.

670
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,670
You should support me.

671
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,838
I do support you. I support.

672
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,952
All right, forget it. Take your bracer off.

673
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,353
- We're not shooting anymore.
- Okay.

674
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,211
There's a chance
I might be going to New York.

675
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,576
A small chance.

676
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,810
You think you'd like to come,
maybe, if I go?

677
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,144
Yeah.

678
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,347
We could maybe go with Poppop.

679
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,890
- He's got some tests.
- Yeah.

680
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,904
Hey.

681
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,306
Hey, Mike.

682
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,206
You don't look real good, Dad.

683
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,108
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

684
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,908
- What are you doing out here?
- Just sitting here.

685
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,409
Sometimes I just sit here
and look at the house.

686
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,121
- You park here sometimes?
- Yeah. Sometimes.

687
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:12,094
I just like to see you guys.
I see you playing guitar up there.

688
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,224
Okay.

689
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,162
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

690
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,532
- You know, Poppop...
- Yeah.

691
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,897
...he's sick.
- Mom said.

692
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,501
I was thinking about that, too.

693
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,780
Why do you have a bow and arrow
in there?

694
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,413
I was just out with Shelly.
I'm not playing favorites.

695
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,988
I just think we need to be together
for a while.

696
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,716
Yeah, that's okay.

697
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,922
- How's your program going?
- Great.

698
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,095
You're gonna get that camera
if you keep it up!

699
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,808
Look at this house.

700
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,571
Someone should be happy here.

701
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,215
How did I fuck this up?

702
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,216
Seriously.

703
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:14,081
What if I remembered the tartar sauce?
Would things be different?

704
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,927
Would Robert die
not thinking I'm a jerk-off...

705
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,589
jerk-fuck?

706
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,056
Don't forget the tartar sauce.

707
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,191
Just call the order in, Noreen...

708
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,826
and quit busting
my you-know-what, okay?

709
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,269
You always half-listen
to what I'm saying to you!

710
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,238
I heard you. Tartar sauce.

711
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,137
Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce.
Tartar sauce.

712
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,375
Tartar sauce, tartar sauce,
tartar sauce, tartar sauce.

713
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,051
Man, how I'd like
to put my face in there.

714
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,786
Right in there. Tartar sauce.

715
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,096
My hips are cold. Tartar sauce.

716
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,791
That's when you know it's cold.

717
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,697
I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce.

718
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,269
A lot of guys don't.
Well, maybe they do.

719
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,838
Maybe that's just black guys.
Tartar sauce.

720
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,408
What happened to the guy
who was trying to go around the world...

721
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,737
in a balloon? Did he make it?

722
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:08,106
I should put some espionage...

723
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:10,112
or stolen plutonium in my novel.
Tartar sauce.

724
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:13,047
Spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold!

725
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,212
Neil Young?
Why am I thinking about Neil Young?

726
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,481
Neil Diamond. Neil.
There's not a lot of famous Neils.

727
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,250
Is this Wednesday?
I wish I had two dicks.

728
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,326
I thought the whole family was going
to learn Spanish together this year.

729
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,054
That never really happened.

730
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:25,662
I haven't had a Spanish omelet
in a long time.

731
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,220
I haven't had a Spanish omelet
in a long time.

732
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,762
Here we go.

733
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:33,533
Anything else?

734
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,530
No.

735
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,602
Where is the tartar sauce?

736
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,272
They were out. They apologized.

737
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,679
- They were cool about it.
- They were out?

738
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,921
- They were out.
- They were out of tartar sauce?

739
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,656
I'm calling them.

740
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:59,453
Fuck, Noreen.

741
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:04,064
It's not about the tartar sauce.
It's about you. You don't care!

742
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,931
I don't care about tartar sauce!

743
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,628
I'm trying to make a living for this family.

744
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,933
I've got work things to think about
and pressure.

745
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,201
Tartar sauce?
Fuck, Noreen, are you serious?

746
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,742
You are so selfish!

747
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,581
I would do anything for you...

748
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,140
- Everything you say is right.
...as if we're not happy.

749
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,622
- I'm trying to take care of the family.
- You come in here, looked in my face...

750
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,885
and you lied to me, Dave.

751
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,757
Do you think I'm a moron? "They're out."

752
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,091
We both just think it's better
for the kids.

753
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,133
David, sacrifice is...

754
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,839
To get anything of value,
you have to sacrifice.

755
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:51,608
I know that, Dad. But I think
if we continue down this road...

756
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,376
it's going to be too detrimental
for the kids.

757
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,178
It's just too hard.

758
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:59,119
Do you know that the harder thing to do
and the right thing to do...

759
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,882
are usually the same thing?

760
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,954
Nothing that has meaning is easy.

761
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,057
Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.

762
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,577
I'm not comfortable
with an 18-degree variance.

763
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,150
- Why even forecast?
- It's a technical art...

764
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,223
not a science. People get that.

765
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,656
- Let's narrow it down, Tim.
- Dave, it's random.

766
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,594
We do our best.

767
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,989
A day can have that variance.

768
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,865
- Dave, phone call.
- Tell him to take a message.

769
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,436
It's Hello America.

770
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,660
Can we shop here?

771
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,455
Sure. Where is that?

772
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,358
- Bendel.
- All right.

773
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,303
Dad?

774
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,112
You know what? Let's go for a walk.
Take a break.

775
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,815
You don't like it?

776
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,016
No, maybe we'll come back later.
We'll just take a break.

777
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,024
- So how's everything going?
- Good.

778
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,134
- How's school?
- Good.

779
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,501
- Dance school?
- Good.

780
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,970
You know, when I was in school...

781
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:02,171
I guess the hardest thing
was how other kids can be a little mean.

782
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,704
Names and stuff.

783
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,109
Do you ever get called names?

784
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,684
Like what?

785
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:14,854
I don't know, like "dummy"
if you miss a question...

786
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,755
or "camel toe."

787
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,192
Yeah. Camel toe.

788
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,292
Do you know why?

789
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:24,930
Why what?

790
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,837
Why you get called camel toe?

791
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,998
Yeah.

792
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,135
Why, hon?

793
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,439
Because camel toes are tough.

794
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,984
They can walk all over the desert
and all the hot rocks.

795
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,418
I'm tough.

796
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,655
That's right. It's because they're tough.

797
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,892
You ready to shop again?

798
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:04,164
I think they make car tires
out of camel toes.

799
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,603
Yeah, I think I heard that.

800
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,638
I just think you're more grown-up
than that other stuff.

801
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,272
I don't think I like it.

802
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,408
But that was sort of kid stuff.

803
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,317
I like this dress. It's New York style.

804
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,519
Let me see.

805
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:28,931
Hey.

806
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,633
- You like it?
- I like it. Yeah.

807
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,595
Do you like it?

808
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,604
Yeah, I think I do.

809
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:40,335
Do you feel comfortable in it?
Because, you know, that's the thing.

810
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,244
Yeah, it's comfy.

811
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,444
You look great.

812
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,579
You look all grown-up.

813
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,985
Okay, change. Let's get some more.

814
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,074
Really?

815
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:53,213
Sure, and then we'll go show Poppop
some of this stuff.

816
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,145
Poppop! Poppop!

817
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,615
- Check this out.
- That's nice, hon.

818
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:29,021
I know. I got a lot more, too!

819
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,655
Dave.

820
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,494
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right.

821
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,501
Mike got arrested.

822
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,494
What?

823
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,703
He fucked his drug counselor's car up.
They were on their way to a movie.

824
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,078
A movie?

825
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,414
Mike said he was trying to suck him off.

826
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,960
Then Mike chucked a rock
through his car's passenger window.

827
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,989
What is this sucking
and chucking rocks?

828
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,864
I mean, what is this?

829
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,895
What did the guy say?

830
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:19,407
He said Mike tried to jack his wallet.

831
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:30,047
What is this sucking and chucking
and jacking and fucking-up, Son?

832
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,210
He's 15 years old!

833
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,590
What is this shit?

834
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:38,187
- Where is he?
- He's at home.

835
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,092
What is this?

836
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,690
Fuck.

837
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,433
Are you ready for the doctors?

838
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,234
Yeah.

839
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,810
Got you! You're dead.

840
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,886
I think just what he said happened,
happened.

841
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,921
I think the guy was trying
to make a move on him...

842
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,081
and Mike got surprised and scared.

843
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:11,559
Hon, will you get me a pop
from the pop machine?

844
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,819
Can you get your pop later?

845
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:18,127
I'm trying to send Shelly away
so she doesn't have to hear this.

846
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,930
This guy says that Mike
tried to steal his wallet...

847
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:24,404
and that's why they were fighting
when the police came.

848
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,567
- How is he?
- He's scared. I don't know.

849
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,246
I can come home.

850
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:34,215
No, stay there
and do your Hello America thing.

851
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,146
- You act like...
- What?

852
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,177
Like Mike's in trouble...

853
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,883
'cause I'm interviewing
at Hello America. Give me a break!

854
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,550
I don't have any money.

855
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,795
Russ is helping anyway.

856
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,197
- That dildo's what?
- He's been a big help, okay?

857
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,126
You can stay there.

858
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,829
Fine. I'll stay here with camel toe.

859
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,930
You just take care of stuff there!
You take care of it!

860
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,804
Camel toe? What are you talking about?

861
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,173
I had to find out how kids
taunt Shelly about that...

862
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,540
and you're letting her get taunted.

863
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,740
You're not paying attention
to the way she goes to school!

864
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,316
I take care of everything around here.

865
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,441
Well, I bought her new stuff.

866
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,984
I bought her a bunch
of brand new stuff...

867
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,611
- and she told me all kinds of stuff, so...
- Don't be such a dick.

868
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,212
You have her for one weekend.

869
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,224
You know what, Noreen? Just...

870
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,993
Fuck! Whatever. Let me talk to Mike.

871
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,496
He's sleeping,
and don't talk to me like that.

872
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,897
More dildo, more fucking...

873
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,201
Listen, I have to go, Noreen.
I'll talk to you soon.

874
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,532
Whatever.

875
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:34,202
I thought you were trying
to improve matters with Noreen...

876
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,777
if not reconcile.

877
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,904
I am. What did Frost say?

878
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:41,010
He wants to speak to me
in about 10 minutes.

879
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,812
It was cold in there.

880
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,449
Would you get me a coffee, Dave?
So I can warm up.

881
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,184
Yeah, Dad.

882
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,688
Dildo. Jacking...

883
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,264
Hi.

884
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,701
Hi. $0.65.

885
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,404
Fuck.

886
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,641
- Hey.
- Hi.

887
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,307
Poppop went in?

888
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,443
- Yeah.
- Great. Yeah. He wanted a coffee.

889
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,078
Do you have my wallet?

890
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,822
You only had $1.

891
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,630
You should carry more money than that.

892
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,858
I know.

893
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:45,005
Well, did he say
whether any more therapy could...

894
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:48,514
No, he didn't have a different opinion
than Pritch.

895
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,146
There's too large a plane.

896
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,124
It's a no-go.

897
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,262
- Well, did he say...
- He said months.

898
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,162
- Did he say a lot of months?
- Well, what's a lot?

899
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,035
I don't know, like 12.

900
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,442
Well, if he meant 12,
he probably would've said a year, Son.

901
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,472
I think he meant three or four.

902
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,835
Well, you have a big day tomorrow.

903
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,736
The Hello America show.

904
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,934
Yeah.

905
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,739
...and here comes the grand marshal,
Dave Spritzel.

906
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,674
Didn't his name used to be Spritz?

907
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:56,938
Yeah, it sure did...

908
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,276
but he changed it back
to the original Spritzel.

909
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,440
Why the change, Ed?

910
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,745
Well, when you're national,
there's no more up.

911
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:03,910
So he changed it back...

912
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,751
like John "Cougar" Mellencamp.
He's realer now and more authentic.

913
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,985
- Who's that with him?
- Those are the wife and kids.

914
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,619
Didn't they used to have
a real fucked-up relationship?

915
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,255
Not anymore.
That's something else that changed.

916
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:18,459
It seems
Hello America with Byrant Gumbel...

917
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,001
gave them all a fresh start...

918
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:24,699
and an increase in salary to $980,000
outside promotional fees...

919
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:28,072
which puts Dave
well over $1 million a year.

920
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,848
- That got his wife's ear, I bet.
- You bet. That buys a lot of face time.

921
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,348
Now everything's great.

922
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,317
- Did he say that?
- Yeah, he told me that...

923
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,722
Hello, America.

924
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,661
What are your hobbies?

925
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,164
Writing. Archery.

926
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,740
And you don't have a degree
in meteorology?

927
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,544
General communications.

928
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:42,145
Well, listen. We've seen a lot
of your work in Chicago.

929
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,218
Okay.

930
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:47,055
We think you're great, refreshing.

931
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,084
We love the Spritz Nipper.

932
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,352
Great.

933
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,657
Why don't we run some blue screen,
and we'll do a walk-through on the set?

934
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,787
Great.

935
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,702
Here's your station.
We'll run some screen.

936
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,775
Give me a second to set it up.

937
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:35,769
- Hi.
- Hi.

938
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,304
I'm waiting for Mark.
I'm running some screen.

939
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,966
- Dave.
- Bryant.

940
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,134
- Nervous?
- No.

941
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,113
- Sure?
- Yeah.

942
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,616
You look just a little bit nervous.

943
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,015
It's not nerves.

944
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,420
- Other shit.
- Yeah.

945
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,490
...mild in the Northwest.

946
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,255
As this high-pressure system
gives way...

947
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,921
we'll see warm temperatures
in New Mexico...

948
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,760
I know it's not neurosurgery...

949
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:07,097
but green screen is the one part
of my job that's not really easy.

950
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,865
...35 in New York with colder
temperatures west to Michigan...

951
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,304
You need a sense of where put-ons
will come from...

952
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,171
and a pretty strong sense of scale.

953
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,370
...there are travel advisories
in New Orleans and Atlanta.

954
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,468
It's pretty heavy weather...

955
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,377
I've gotten real good at it.

956
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,083
I thought everything went over
pretty well.

957
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,517
So we'll let you know
in a couple of days.

958
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,749
Okay.

959
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:32,021
This is my father, Robert Spritzel,
and my daughter.

960
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,694
We're a little late for our plane...

961
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,024
so we thought we'd leave from here.

962
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,292
- Yeah, I'm sorry. We kept you late.
- That's cool.

963
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,890
- So you've got the numbers?
- Yes.

964
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,333
There's a built-in with Purina
I forgot. $42,000.

965
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,404
Okay.

966
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,733
- What's a built-in?
- It's a compulsory endorsement...

967
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:46,672
if I'm offered the job.

968
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,170
- Dog food?
- Yeah. Pet products.

969
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,649
Dave doesn't own a pet.

970
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,846
Well, I have Jackson.

971
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,879
Jackson lives with your wife and kids.

972
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,520
We'll let you know.

973
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,272
- Russ is here.
- Okay.

974
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,481
- Where's Mike?
- Inside.

975
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,613
- Dave.
- Hi, Russ.

976
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:39,194
He's upstairs.
He's still pretty upset about it.

977
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,388
- Did he talk about it?
- Yeah.

978
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:46,696
- To you?
- He's told us what happened.

979
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,566
He was with his counselor, Don Boden.
I guess he...

980
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,937
I don't really know why
what happened next happened.

981
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,472
He was talking about my son,
and I was taking my gloves off.

982
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,212
Apparently, they were going to a movie...

983
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,040
- What the fuck?
- Why are you here?

984
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,675
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

985
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,651
- I'm helping Noreen!
- Why are you helping?

986
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,723
- Dave.
- Son. Jesus.

987
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,825
Here's something that...

988
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:19,868
if you want your father to think
you're not a silly fuck...

989
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,870
don't slap a guy across the face
with a glove.

990
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,304
Because if you do that,
that's what he will think...

991
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:29,139
unless you're a nobleman or something
in the 19th century...

992
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,735
which I'm not.

993
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,349
- You can get inside okay, Dad?
- Yeah.

994
01:08:09,768 --> 01:08:12,293
"When my back's against the wall,
I order a chink call-girl...

995
01:08:12,404 --> 01:08:13,735
"or I box some rounds with Richie...

996
01:08:14,973 --> 01:08:16,702
"the Puerto Rican southpaw
at Clancey's gym.

997
01:08:18,143 --> 01:08:19,075
"'But tonight,' Roy thought...

998
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:21,042
"'once I smuggle
this fucking plutonium out...

999
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:23,774
"'I'm just going to drink some Scotch
and hit the sack.'

1000
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:25,679
"Roy had picked up Oliver
at his science lab...

1001
01:08:25,784 --> 01:08:26,808
"and there he snagged the vials.

1002
01:08:26,918 --> 01:08:28,249
"He stashed them
in his computer case..."

1003
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:49,500
My mom discovered an idea
known as a living funeral...

1004
01:08:50,175 --> 01:08:53,076
in a book she read
to help her with Robert dying.

1005
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,954
It's where someone's family
and friends gather...

1006
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:10,721
like they might at the person's funeral...

1007
01:09:12,397 --> 01:09:15,833
only when the person's alive,
so they can see everybody.

1008
01:09:39,624 --> 01:09:41,216
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

1009
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:42,884
Hey, what's the Nipper?

1010
01:09:42,994 --> 01:09:45,588
- What's that?
- What's the Nipper this week?

1011
01:09:45,697 --> 01:09:47,028
I don't know.

1012
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:48,429
You don't know yet?

1013
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:49,932
Come on, man.

1014
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:52,094
What? I just asked you
about the Nipper.

1015
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:55,172
Monday, okay? That's the... Okay?

1016
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:59,676
- What's your problem?
- It's February, man. It's cold.

1017
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:02,240
Fuck!

1018
01:10:03,448 --> 01:10:05,416
- Fuck you, then.
- Fuck you!

1019
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,477
Do you know what variance is?

1020
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:09,884
You think you could pick out a day...

1021
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:12,923
a week ahead and give a realistic...
You know?

1022
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:14,724
- Did you know that?
- Weatherman!

1023
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:16,123
God! Fuck!

1024
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:27,735
I have kids!

1025
01:10:28,139 --> 01:10:30,107
I have to go see my kids!

1026
01:10:30,442 --> 01:10:33,343
You put fucking pie shit on my coat!

1027
01:10:33,778 --> 01:10:36,838
I have to see my kids
with pie on me, man?

1028
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:38,776
Go see your kids with shit on you!

1029
01:10:38,883 --> 01:10:40,510
Hey, calm down, man!

1030
01:10:41,786 --> 01:10:44,152
I have to see my family!

1031
01:10:45,857 --> 01:10:47,188
I have to see...

1032
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,060
- Hello?
- Hello? Dave?

1033
01:11:00,505 --> 01:11:03,804
- What?
- It's Mark Dersen from Hello America.

1034
01:11:05,944 --> 01:11:07,172
Hi, Dave.

1035
01:11:19,157 --> 01:11:20,681
- Take care.
- Okay.

1036
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:23,653
Noreen.

1037
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:25,459
- Hi.
- Hi.

1038
01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:29,498
Shelly looks nice.

1039
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:32,266
We bought that in New York.

1040
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,531
Yeah, I know. That's why I said it.

1041
01:11:34,639 --> 01:11:36,106
It's very nice.

1042
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:42,336
Noreen, I got offered the show.
Hello America with Bryant Gumbel.

1043
01:11:43,648 --> 01:11:45,206
Well, that's great.

1044
01:11:47,252 --> 01:11:51,120
- Are you gonna take it?
- I'm thinking about it.

1045
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:55,553
It's a pretty substantial salary,
and you know the venue. It's big.

1046
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,220
It's a pretty big salary jump, I guess.

1047
01:12:00,265 --> 01:12:02,995
$1.2 million all in, Noreen.

1048
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,638
Can we think about that?

1049
01:12:08,206 --> 01:12:09,366
What?

1050
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:15,076
What that kind of change
could be like for everybody.

1051
01:12:15,513 --> 01:12:17,538
Mike, Shelly, you know?

1052
01:12:20,051 --> 01:12:23,214
If we thought about trying again.

1053
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:29,885
Dave, I'm marrying Russ.

1054
01:14:19,904 --> 01:14:22,668
Accuracy equals focusing on a point.

1055
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,478
Gravity pulls an inch a yard.

1056
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:29,212
You point up.

1057
01:14:34,352 --> 01:14:36,154
But you have to factor in wind...

1058
01:14:36,154 --> 01:14:36,483
But you have to factor in wind...

1059
01:14:36,588 --> 01:14:38,886
which is the most difficult part.

1060
01:14:46,364 --> 01:14:47,661
Noreen.

1061
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,140
I had to go in anyway.

1062
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,844
It was time for my speech.

1063
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:09,977
And that's what I know
about Robert Spritzel.

1064
01:15:10,588 --> 01:15:14,854
Forbearance, charity, wisdom.

1065
01:15:16,895 --> 01:15:18,863
There are too few like him.

1066
01:15:19,497 --> 01:15:21,795
And now Robert's son, David.

1067
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:37,212
Good afternoon.

1068
01:15:41,419 --> 01:15:43,853
Many of you came
from long distances...

1069
01:15:44,756 --> 01:15:48,419
and I know I speak for my mom
and Noreen...

1070
01:15:48,693 --> 01:15:52,459
and my family, Mike and Shelly,
when I say thank you.

1071
01:15:56,801 --> 01:16:01,067
When I think of my dad,
I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock.

1072
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,778
And then the power went out.

1073
01:16:19,891 --> 01:16:23,418
Then, when the lights came back on
in 40 minutes...

1074
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:27,153
everyone had pretty much forgotten
that I was talking...

1075
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,733
and we never finished
that part of the thing.

1076
01:16:32,904 --> 01:16:35,600
So my speech was,
"When I think of my dad...

1077
01:16:35,707 --> 01:16:38,198
"I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock."

1078
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:42,411
That's all I said
at my dad's living funeral...

1079
01:16:43,047 --> 01:16:45,038
something about Bob Seger.

1080
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:07,799
You've reached 272-7638.
Please leave a message.

1081
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:12,836
Dave, it's Mark Dersen
from Hello America.

1082
01:17:13,511 --> 01:17:16,878
Can you give me a call back?
I called a couple of times Friday...

1083
01:17:16,981 --> 01:17:20,144
and I'm wondering
why you haven't called me back.

1084
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:23,818
If I need to move down on my list,
look, I need to know. Okay?

1085
01:17:23,921 --> 01:17:27,152
It's not "Hello, you know,
whatever, Orlando."

1086
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,253
Look. I'm still jacked about you, Dave.

1087
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:32,921
I just need to hear from you.
Give me a call.

1088
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:44,870
Your phone's ringing.

1089
01:17:46,844 --> 01:17:48,038
I know.

1090
01:17:51,783 --> 01:17:53,751
Why aren't you getting it?

1091
01:17:55,486 --> 01:17:57,750
It's the Bryant Gumbel thing.

1092
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:01,217
So why aren't you getting it?

1093
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:04,461
Did you bring that stuff?

1094
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:06,496
It's by the door.

1095
01:18:14,672 --> 01:18:16,333
You should get it.

1096
01:18:27,952 --> 01:18:29,010
Fuck.

1097
01:18:30,688 --> 01:18:33,179
It was a McDonald's hot apple pie.

1098
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:35,125
They're not kidding.

1099
01:18:35,827 --> 01:18:37,124
It was hot.

1100
01:19:01,752 --> 01:19:04,346
The other thing that gets to people...

1101
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:06,919
that leads to pies, I guess...

1102
01:19:07,425 --> 01:19:09,723
are these catch phrases
we're required to use...

1103
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:11,954
to single the program out.

1104
01:19:12,663 --> 01:19:14,631
It gets under people's skin.

1105
01:19:14,732 --> 01:19:15,892
Spritz Nipper.

1106
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:23,440
But the whole thing about all of it...

1107
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,566
all the getting hit with stuff...

1108
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,040
the whole thing is, who gets hit
with a fucking pie, anyway?

1109
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:31,138
Did anyone ever throw a pie
at Thomas Jefferson?

1110
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:33,376
Or Buzz Aldrin? I doubt it.

1111
01:19:33,484 --> 01:19:36,112
But this is like the ninth time I got...

1112
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:39,022
Clowns get hit with pies.

1113
01:19:53,237 --> 01:19:56,138
- Fuck!
- I'm Mike's father! Here's your shit!

1114
01:20:05,683 --> 01:20:07,947
I saw you buy this at the mall
on North Avenue!

1115
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:09,815
And I'm telling the cops, too!

1116
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:13,379
So you can cut your crap
about Mike jacking your wallet!

1117
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:21,160
He's just a kid. See!

1118
01:20:21,632 --> 01:20:24,260
He looks grown, but he's just a kid!

1119
01:20:25,203 --> 01:20:27,671
You fucking asshole.

1120
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,743
I mean,
I'll bet no one ever threw a pie at, like...

1121
01:20:35,846 --> 01:20:39,373
Harriet Tubman, the founder of
the Underground Railroad.

1122
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:42,446
I'll bet you a million fucking dollars.

1123
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:15,581
The first time I was struck
with something...

1124
01:21:16,153 --> 01:21:18,621
a chicken breast from Kenny Rogers...

1125
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:21,648
I was standing next to a garbage pail.

1126
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:26,358
I thought it might've been an accident,
that they were throwing it out.

1127
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:29,490
The second time,
it hit me square on the chin...

1128
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,167
a soft taco.

1129
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:33,096
Then, pop.

1130
01:21:34,038 --> 01:21:35,505
A falafel.

1131
01:21:36,874 --> 01:21:38,171
McNuggets.

1132
01:21:40,211 --> 01:21:41,838
Always fast food.

1133
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:44,578
Fast food.

1134
01:21:45,783 --> 01:21:48,809
Shit people would rather throw out
than finish.

1135
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,111
It's easy. It tastes all right...

1136
01:21:51,222 --> 01:21:54,419
but it doesn't really provide you
any nourishment.

1137
01:21:56,527 --> 01:21:58,051
I'm fast food.

1138
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:00,688
Hey.

1139
01:22:01,532 --> 01:22:02,556
Hey.

1140
01:22:07,038 --> 01:22:08,972
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

1141
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:14,711
Am I gonna get in trouble?
I didn't do anything.

1142
01:22:17,014 --> 01:22:19,778
You're not in trouble. I took care of it.

1143
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,016
I got on him.

1144
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:26,512
I let him know
we're not messing around.

1145
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:28,021
I whaled on him.

1146
01:22:28,793 --> 01:22:29,851
What?

1147
01:22:30,594 --> 01:22:33,062
I caught him one clean one for sure,
on the forehead...

1148
01:22:33,164 --> 01:22:35,564
and then I fucking whaled on him.

1149
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:37,665
Seriously?

1150
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:42,532
He's not going to say you stole anything,
and you're not in trouble.

1151
01:22:50,781 --> 01:22:53,614
- What are you eating?
- Corn dog.

1152
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:11,894
You're a kid, Mike. Fuck.

1153
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,704
- I'm not a kid.
- You are a kid.

1154
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:19,174
Don't put yourself in grown-up situations
again until you're a grown-up.

1155
01:23:19,677 --> 01:23:20,974
- Okay.
- Okay?

1156
01:23:21,078 --> 01:23:22,170
Yeah.

1157
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:27,317
- Do you want me to get you a corn dog?
- What? No.

1158
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:30,418
What do you want?

1159
01:23:32,123 --> 01:23:33,317
Nothing.

1160
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:52,072
Weatherman!

1161
01:24:00,718 --> 01:24:02,117
- Hey.
- Hi.

1162
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:06,554
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1163
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,184
I just wanted you to...

1164
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:11,283
What?

1165
01:24:13,764 --> 01:24:15,527
I was eighteen

1166
01:24:15,866 --> 01:24:17,527
Didn't have a care

1167
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:20,832
Working for peanuts

1168
01:24:21,505 --> 01:24:23,268
Not a dime to spare

1169
01:24:25,309 --> 01:24:29,245
But I was lean and solid everywhere

1170
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:31,611
Like a rock

1171
01:24:34,518 --> 01:24:36,315
I don't really get it.

1172
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:38,979
Am I following it?

1173
01:24:42,193 --> 01:24:46,027
It was just a lead up
to other things I wanted to say.

1174
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:48,361
Here's the part.

1175
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:50,660
And I held firm

1176
01:24:51,135 --> 01:24:53,000
To what I felt was right

1177
01:24:53,471 --> 01:24:55,302
Like a rock

1178
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,167
I wanted to talk about that part...

1179
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:00,169
about you.

1180
01:25:01,245 --> 01:25:02,542
That's like you.

1181
01:25:02,646 --> 01:25:04,841
I was strong as I could be

1182
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:06,978
Like a rock

1183
01:25:09,954 --> 01:25:11,421
I got the job.

1184
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,087
New York?

1185
01:25:15,493 --> 01:25:18,519
That's terrific.
That's a remarkable income.

1186
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:22,155
That's more money than I ever made,
that salary.

1187
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,926
Yeah.

1188
01:25:24,435 --> 01:25:27,063
That's quite
an American accomplishment.

1189
01:25:27,805 --> 01:25:28,931
Thanks.

1190
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,137
Are you okay?

1191
01:25:41,285 --> 01:25:43,150
I can't knuckle down.

1192
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:45,617
Noreen's marrying Russ.

1193
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,089
There's nothing
to knuckle down on, so...

1194
01:25:48,192 --> 01:25:50,660
I can't fucking knuckle down.

1195
01:25:54,298 --> 01:25:55,595
Your hand.

1196
01:25:58,836 --> 01:26:01,031
I just saw Mike's counselor.

1197
01:26:02,206 --> 01:26:05,903
Mike mentioned that you
were gonna fix this business up.

1198
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:09,372
He's in no trouble?

1199
01:26:11,682 --> 01:26:13,081
Good job.

1200
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,255
Your hand okay?

1201
01:26:21,392 --> 01:26:22,586
It's okay.

1202
01:26:23,027 --> 01:26:25,120
- You certain?
- Don't worry.

1203
01:26:26,397 --> 01:26:29,332
You always worry about your kids...

1204
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,025
no matter how old.

1205
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:34,997
There's always looking after.

1206
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:48,812
I read your book.

1207
01:26:49,553 --> 01:26:50,611
Fuck.

1208
01:26:53,924 --> 01:26:57,690
I was going to do some more work on it,
then I chucked it.

1209
01:26:58,228 --> 01:27:00,492
- You chucked it.
- Garbage.

1210
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:07,466
It's just what I do, David.

1211
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:10,737
I've practiced and I've gotten good.

1212
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:13,642
Like you and the weather business.

1213
01:27:16,947 --> 01:27:18,539
But I don't predict it.

1214
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:21,140
Nobody does, 'cause it's just wind.
It's wind.

1215
01:27:21,251 --> 01:27:22,878
It blows all over the place!

1216
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,511
What the fuck?

1217
01:27:32,596 --> 01:27:34,791
I have to go to work.

1218
01:27:35,132 --> 01:27:36,258
David.

1219
01:27:42,806 --> 01:27:44,774
This shit life...

1220
01:27:48,178 --> 01:27:50,305
we must chuck some things.

1221
01:27:55,753 --> 01:27:57,380
We must chuck them...

1222
01:27:58,922 --> 01:28:00,719
in this shit life.

1223
01:28:08,098 --> 01:28:10,066
There's always looking after.

1224
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,767
You have time.

1225
01:28:21,745 --> 01:28:22,803
Thanks.

1226
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:24,432
Pretty soon after Robert's living funeral,
we had his real one.

1227
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,768
I'm sorry for your loss.

1228
01:30:27,538 --> 01:30:29,938
That's a lovely thing to say to me.

1229
01:30:31,575 --> 01:30:33,133
Where'd you hear that?

1230
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:35,042
His friends.

1231
01:30:42,986 --> 01:30:45,614
I'm glad one of you brought an umbrella.

1232
01:30:45,889 --> 01:30:48,722
I had a feeling
it was going to rain today.

1233
01:30:48,992 --> 01:30:50,926
You're not going to take my job,
are you?

1234
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:55,192
No. I'm going to be a cameraman
for Monday Night Football.

1235
01:30:56,867 --> 01:30:58,164
Is that okay?

1236
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:02,869
Yeah. That's good.

1237
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:10,578
There are a great many
of Robert's friends here, even in winter.

1238
01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:14,549
I think it's because Robert was unusual.

1239
01:31:14,651 --> 01:31:17,643
I think that's what
brought so many of you out.

1240
01:31:18,322 --> 01:31:22,088
A loving husband
and father for 40 years.

1241
01:31:22,192 --> 01:31:25,491
And a good friend to some of you
for longer.

1242
01:31:26,363 --> 01:31:30,629
I'm sure that's why
we appreciated and loved Robert.

1243
01:31:31,602 --> 01:31:33,263
He was excellent.

1244
01:31:34,004 --> 01:31:35,301
Selfless.

1245
01:31:36,273 --> 01:31:37,570
Resolute.

1246
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,100
I remember once...

1247
01:31:41,411 --> 01:31:45,177
imagining what my life would be like,
what I'd be like.

1248
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,384
I pictured having all these qualities.

1249
01:31:49,486 --> 01:31:52,455
Strong, positive qualities...

1250
01:31:52,556 --> 01:31:55,650
that people could pick up on
from across a room.

1251
01:31:58,695 --> 01:32:00,287
But as time passed...

1252
01:32:00,397 --> 01:32:03,332
few ever became
any qualities I actually had.

1253
01:32:05,802 --> 01:32:10,205
And all the possibilities I faced,
and the sorts of people I could be...

1254
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:14,801
all of them got reduced every year
to fewer and fewer...

1255
01:32:15,379 --> 01:32:18,007
until finally they got reduced to one...

1256
01:32:18,949 --> 01:32:20,280
to who I am.

1257
01:32:27,057 --> 01:32:28,752
And that's who I am...

1258
01:32:32,429 --> 01:32:34,090
the weatherman.

1259
01:33:26,783 --> 01:33:29,650
But first Dave Spritz has the check
of our national weather. Dave.

1260
01:33:29,753 --> 01:33:32,813
Well, thanks, Bryant. Well, it feels like
spring if you're in the Northeast.

1261
01:33:32,923 --> 01:33:34,083
Is it gonna last? Let's take a look.

1262
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:37,058
We've got a warm weather system
to thank for these high temperatures...

1263
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,287
Mike, you ready for school?

1264
01:33:39,396 --> 01:33:40,522
Russ?

1265
01:33:41,264 --> 01:33:42,754
Let's go, guys.

1266
01:33:43,266 --> 01:33:44,392
Come on.

1267
01:33:46,036 --> 01:33:47,503
You're gonna get it!

1268
01:33:47,738 --> 01:33:49,569
- Bye, Shelly.
- Bye, Mom.

1269
01:33:49,673 --> 01:33:52,335
That's your national weather.
I'll be back with your local focus...

1270
01:33:52,442 --> 01:33:54,103
at the bottom of the hour.

1271
01:34:14,498 --> 01:34:17,228
- Hey, are you Dave Spritz?
- Yeah.

1272
01:34:17,934 --> 01:34:20,232
- Can I get your autograph?
- Sure.

1273
01:34:24,608 --> 01:34:26,803
So is it going to rain today?

1274
01:34:28,578 --> 01:34:29,875
Who knows?

1275
01:34:35,018 --> 01:34:36,485
Hey, Hello America.

1276
01:34:37,287 --> 01:34:40,120
I've been doing the show
for a few months.

1277
01:34:40,223 --> 01:34:42,885
People don't throw things
at me anymore...

1278
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:45,661
maybe because I carry a bow around.

1279
01:34:45,829 --> 01:34:47,126
I don't know.

1280
01:34:53,303 --> 01:34:54,895
I go back to Chicago weekends...

1281
01:34:55,005 --> 01:34:56,870
keep it steady with Mike and Shelly...

1282
01:34:56,973 --> 01:35:00,807
come back, do the weather.
So... Forecast?

1283
01:35:01,678 --> 01:35:02,906
Come on.

1284
01:35:03,146 --> 01:35:05,307
Another man is with my family.

1285
01:35:05,949 --> 01:35:08,941
Things didn't work out
the way I predicted.

1286
01:35:09,152 --> 01:35:11,279
Accepting that's not easy...

1287
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:15,084
but easy doesn't enter
into grown-up life.

1288
01:35:18,195 --> 01:35:20,891
I'll take this American accomplishment.

1289
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:22,959
That's where I live...

1290
01:35:23,066 --> 01:35:26,297
behind Fire Brigade 47. Okay.

1291
01:35:26,837 --> 01:35:28,805
But in front of SpongeBob.

1292
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:32,832
Hello, America.
