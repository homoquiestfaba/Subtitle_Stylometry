00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:24,224

I was in the backseat #

8
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:26,392

00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,093

# I hear the whispers

00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:47,809
# oh, oh, oh

34
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:51,477
# take me down

35
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,380
Mona, I'm on upper county.

36
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,882
Stutz's cows
are in the road again.

37
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,349
Again?

38
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:01,084
Yeah, I'm gonna set flares

39
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:02,918
and go get 'em.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,252
Should I log that?

41
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:06,788
No, I'll log it.

42
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,356
Stutz house...

43
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,924
Road.

44
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:12,924
It's logged.

45
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:18,194
Come on now, cow,
get out of the road.

46
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:24,799
Hey, Mona.

47
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:29,334
Uh, Mona,
I got a shoe here.

48
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,434
A shoe?

49
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:36,138
Yeah, like, a girl's shoe.

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Oh.

51
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,575
Should I bring it in?

52
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,342
A shoe?

53
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,411
Hang on a second.

54
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:03,389
Hello?

55
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:13,461
Is someone there?

56
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:14,929
Oh.

57
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:17,864
Mona.

58
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,098
Uh, Mona?

59
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,066
Mona.

60
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,400
Mona!

61
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,835
I can hear you.

62
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:24,836
Uh...

63
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,836
I got a...

64
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:30,572
I got a... I got a woman
on the ground here.

65
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,073
Has there been a wreck?

66
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:35,108
No, no, no, she's, uh...

67
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,312
Oh... Ugh.

68
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,879
What?

69
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:44,314
Uh, she's, uh...

70
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,348
She's dead.

71
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,415
Uh...

72
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,516
Hey, Mona.

73
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,051
What?

74
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,018
Are you sure?

75
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,286
Who's at the scene?

76
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:55,855
T.J.

77
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:57,856
Oh, no. Is he alone?

78
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,456
Is he all right?

79
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,490
No, no.
I'll be right there.

80
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,591
Okay.

81
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:15,566
I got to say...

82
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,200
Didn't expect to be dealing
with a homicide

83
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:18,235
my first week here.

84
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,402
- This happen often?
- No.

85
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:23,104
First homicide here
since I was a teenager.

86
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,938
Thought you were
from cleveland.

87
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,974
Cleveland PD.
I grew up here.

88
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,474
Is your family still here?

89
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,108
Yeah, they're around.

90
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,209
You see them?

91
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,444
Oh, I see them all the time.

92
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,311
They don't see me much.

93
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,115
You all right, T.J.?

94
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:41,515
Thanks, chief.

95
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:43,016
Where's skid?

96
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:44,985
Uh, went to get the
owner there, Mr. Stutz.

97
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:47,152
All right,
let's set some perimeters.

98
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,254
And anything within 100 yards
that didn't grow here,

99
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,154
I want it marked and bagged.

100
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:52,522
- You mean by me?
- Yeah, T.J.

101
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,891
I'll help you in a minute.

102
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,292
Doc?
- Oh, hey, chief.

103
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:00,895
I think it's safe to say
we have a homicide here.

104
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,930
She's amish.

105
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:06,098
Are you sure about that?

106
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,465
Well...

107
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:10,901
No nail polish,
visible piercings,

108
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,101
no makeup, no hair dye,

109
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,435
and that dress is amish.

110
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:16,104
Hey, chief!

111
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,108
Where is she?
Is she english?

112
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,909
We don't know yet.

113
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,477
Did you see or hear anything
out of the ordinary last night?

114
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,912
Uh, it would be better

115
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,545
if you could ask me
the questions.

116
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,382
Please, I cannot speak to her.

117
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:38,117
- Mr. Stutz, you don't have
to speak to Kate Burkholder,

118
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,085
But you do have to speak
to the chief of police,

119
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,119
and that happens to be me.

120
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,220
You can do that here,

121
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,353
or you can do it
at the station.

122
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,122
It's your choice.

123
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:46,622
I did not see anything.

124
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:48,089
Any strange vehicles
on the road?

125
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:49,357
Did you hear anything?

126
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:52,259
I was asleep.
I go to bed at 9:00.

127
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:53,993
- May I go?
- Yes.

128
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,361
But we may need
to speak to you again.

129
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,495
If you leave town,

130
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:57,930
tell Bishop troyers
how to reach you.

131
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,363
I'm not going anywhere.

132
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:03,433
- Please, take her off my land.
- Chief.

133
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,367
We're gonna have a problem
plastering for marks

134
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,935
until this snow melts.

135
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:08,269
Hey! Chief!

136
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,603
Yeah?

137
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:10,971
I think you ought to see this.

138
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,940
There it is.

139
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,241
It's him.

140
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,709
That's impossible.

141
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,310
I don't know about impossible,

142
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,945
but it's so damned unlikely.

143
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,380
You okay?

144
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:27,981
Yeah, fine.

145
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,249
What is that?

146
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:33,518
We had a serial killer
around here years ago.

147
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,986
He killed five young women
back in the '90s.

148
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,354
And then he just stopped.

149
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,088
We thought maybe he
died or just left or...

150
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,990
We called him slaughterhouse.

151
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,024
And that was his signature:

152
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:45,558
Roman numerals, just like that.

153
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,427
All of them amish?

154
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,127
This would be the first.

155
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,262
If it was him, there would be a...

156
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,231
Was that...
Postmortem?

157
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,167
No.

158
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,301
So see,
she was hung upside down,

159
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,602
Then bled to death.

160
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:05,004
And see that?

161
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,539
That's the blood track residue
right there.

162
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,106
Skid, go to Bishop troyers

163
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,741
and ask him if he knows
of an amish girl 18 to 21

164
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:11,741
who's gone missing.

165
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:14,576
You got it, chief.

166
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:26,617
Chief Burkholder,
is it true they found a body...

167
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,751
Not now, I'm afraid.

168
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,153
Hey, who called?

169
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,355
Everybody.

170
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:35,289
The paper's called 11 times.

171
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,623
Uh, channel 8 news...
Already?

172
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,292
Well, they monitor
the police radio, right?

173
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,593
So T.J. Mentions
the word "slaughterhouse"

174
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,028
On the air when calling in the APB.

175
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,161
I know!

176
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,529
That got some attention.

177
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,564
Uh, the Mayor called.
- Wonderful.

178
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,466
Yeah, it gets better.
He's on his way over.

179
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:53,367
- Right.
- Well, you know how it is.

180
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:55,634
Half the town's heard already.
Other half will know by noon.

181
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,004
Thank you.

182
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,473
- That farmer, chief,
why didn't he speak to you?

183
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,007
I'm under the ban.

184
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,308
In english?

185
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,010
I left the amish community
when I was 18.

186
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,443
You were amish?

187
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,012
I was.

188
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,178
For real?

189
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,179
For real.

190
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:14,346
Huh.

191
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:16,081
Thought that was
sort of a lifetime deal.

192
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,782
Well, usually it is.

193
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,082
Ah.

194
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,283
They don't talk to you?

195
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:21,784
Well, they try not to
be rude about it,

196
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:22,785
but those are the rules.

197
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:24,219
When I'm working,

198
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,520
Eventually
they'll answer a question.

199
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,321
Mayor alert.

200
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,023
Your, um, family too?

201
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,323
What about them?

202
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:31,691
They don't speak to you?

203
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:32,791
Nichols, I need you to focus

204
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,159
on what we're dealing with here.

205
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,028
Auggie.

206
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,194
Hey, uh, you got a minute?

207
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:39,762
Yeah, come in.

208
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:40,763
Mr. Mayor.

209
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:42,097
Sure I can't make you

210
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,364
a nice herbal tea, Mr. Mayor?

211
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:46,500
- Oh, I'll call you
if we need anything, Mona.

212
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:48,234
- Hi. I won't keep you.
- Okay.

213
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,268
Um...

214
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,437
I just...
what's your read on this?

215
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,071
Do we need to bring in
the state bureau?

216
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,705
BCI?

217
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:56,773
Not at this point.

218
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,540
Why?
What's your concern?

219
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,608
- Just concerned this is going
to be very demanding

220
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,777
On a small department with
a brand-new chief of police.

221
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,677
I've been here six months.

222
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,645
Kate, if this is the
slaughterhouse killer again,

223
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,346
They'll send us a profiler.

224
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,581
- I don't think that we can
assume it's slaughterhouse.

225
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,582
I mean, this is an amish girl.
The other girls were-

226
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,050
Yeah, Kate...

227
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,184
Kate, it's my call.

228
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,619
And, actually, her being amish

229
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:19,086
Makes this
particularly sensitive.

230
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,521
I think we could benefit from-

231
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:22,455
Auggie, I have led seven
homicide investigations.

232
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,756
And you know what?

233
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,458
All seven guys
are now sitting in youngstown.

234
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,758
Do you not want a profiler?

235
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,160
It won't come out
of your budget.

236
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:32,227
You already called BCI.

237
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,063
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah.

238
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:36,364
And they're sending over
a profiler.

239
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,731
It's still your case.

240
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,066
Oh, come on, don't look at me
like that, Kate.

241
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,734
He's supposed to be
very good.

242
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,568
Course he is.

243
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:49,105
Jay...

244
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:51,606
Jay, you haven't answered
the question.

245
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,107
What's your point?

246
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,442
Why me, and why now?

247
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,709
Why'd I give you
an assignment?

248
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:58,143
You're still on active duty.

249
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:00,645
That four-month bender you've
been on doesn't entitle you...

250
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,313
Whoa, whoa, now.
Hold on, now.

251
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,248
I think a four-month bender
entitles me to, uh-

252
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,116
John, work the case,
or I'm suspending you.

253
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,216
It's up to you.

254
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:10,085
Any questions?

255
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,252
Eh, just one.

256
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:14,087
Why are you always such a jerk?

257
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:41,471
Nichols?

258
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,504
Right here, chief.

259
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,272
Do a nationwide check:

260
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,540
All deaths by exsanguination.

261
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,342
Plus anything with
roman numerals.

262
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:52,111
I figure we're looking
for murders six through ten.

263
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,744
- Exactly.
And, Mona?

264
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,278
That's me.

265
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,447
Send T.J. Down to the
county clerk's office.

266
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,514
Sure.
What do you need?

267
00:10:58,516 --> 00:10:59,815
I want a list

268
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,549
of all abandoned properties
in the county.

269
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:02,850
Because?

270
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,618
- Well, that girl
wasn't killed in the field.

271
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,818
It had to be somewhere remote.

272
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,153
And we'll search them all
as crime scenes.

273
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,721
Okay, boss.

274
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,155
Oh, do you want your messages?

275
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:13,124
Anything important?

276
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:15,125
Mayor wants a progress report.

277
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,625
Course he does.

278
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:20,495
- Hey, you know
a storm's coming in.

279
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:37,705
Hi, Sarah.

280
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,510
I need to see Jacob.

281
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:54,349
Jacob?

282
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:56,483
Your sister is here.

283
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:26,635
That cabinet, did you make it?

284
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:32,772
It's beautiful.

285
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:36,208
Why you've come here?

286
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,177
There's been a murder.

287
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,912
You're here as a policeman?

288
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:45,313
Yes.

289
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:48,215
All right, then.

290
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,249
An amish girl.

291
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,486
You know this for sure?

292
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:55,819
We'll know soon enough...

293
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:59,656
But, um...

294
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:03,391
Jacob, she was bled to death.

295
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:06,426
I need to talk to you
about Daniel Lapp.

296
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,437
What is it you want to know?

297
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,408
- I need to know
that he's dead.

298
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,242
- And you come to me
for this?

299
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,577
- If he is alive,
he is killing again.

300
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,378
And if not,
someone is copying him.

301
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,214
Jacob, I need to know
what happened that night.

302
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,915
You know what happened.

303
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,316
Dad took him in the buggy.

304
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:46,685
And you went with him?

305
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,519
Where?

306
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,554
The old grain mill.

307
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:56,257
Was he dead?

308
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:00,226
Must have been.

309
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:01,694
All that blood.

310
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,997
Did dad bury him?

311
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,265
Couldn't see.

312
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,299
I was outside.
Dad took him inside.

313
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,467
- Wait.
So you don't know if he's dead?

314
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:17,237
- Kate, I swore to dad
I would never speak of this,

315
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,737
And you did too.

316
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,275
Come with me to the old mill.

317
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:27,276
Why?

318
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:28,943
I need to be sure, Jacob.

319
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,245
You mean dig him up?

320
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,247
Are you listening to yourself?

321
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,516
You want to know
about Daniel Lapp,

322
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:40,684
go talk to Lucas Holtz.

323
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,253
He managed the Lapp farm
for years.

324
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:47,321
Give you a reason

325
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,290
to apologize for leaving
without a word.

326
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,026
The man you were gonna marry.

327
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,365
That's it?
That's all you have to say?

328
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,933
It was a dark and ugly thing.

329
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:09,302
We all felt pain
from that time.

330
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,003
I know that.

331
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,340
You smiled at Daniel Lapp...

332
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:20,475
for months when he
worked for mom and dad.

333
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:23,510
I saw you.

334
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:27,747
I know what I did.

335
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:30,482
And I know what he did to me.

336
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,783
- How can you be sure
that Lapp is this man,

337
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:35,018
This-this slaughterhouse?

338
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,419
I'm not.

339
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:40,955
But after he was gone,
the killing stopped.

340
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:45,291
I've made my peace with this.

341
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:50,294
If I go to hell for what I did
all those years ago,

342
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,061
So be it.

343
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,329
I obeyed my father.

344
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:59,666
- Jacob, I have kept my silence
for 17 years.

345
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,302
I kept my word
to mom and dad too.

346
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:05,369
If we go to hell,

347
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,304
It won't be for what we did.

348
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:10,839
It'll be for not stopping
an evil man from killing again.

349
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,311
This is a bad idea.

350
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:20,545
The mill's been shut down
for years.

351
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,314
We have to do this, Jacob.

352
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,459
Our job on this earth
is to forgive, Katie.

353
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:46,561
Forgive even murder,

354
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:47,729
Even worse.

355
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,049
What is it?

356
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,718
That rise.
You see it?

357
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:31,389
What are you doing?

358
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,757
I'm gonna dig.

359
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:57,972
It's a dog.

360
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:59,840
I'm done with this.
- Jacob.

361
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:01,575
No, I'm finished.

362
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:03,409
I shouldn't have come here.

363
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,744
I shouldn't even be speaking
with you.

364
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,392
Hey, boys.

365
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,492
You hungry?

366
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:39,431
Hello, Lucas.

367
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,400
Katie.

368
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:49,404
Thought that was you.

369
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:50,538
Hmm?

370
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,406
I saw you a few weeks ago

371
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,440
On birch road.

372
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:57,842
Oh.

373
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:58,810
I saw you too.

374
00:18:58,812 --> 00:18:59,843
I, um...

375
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:01,577
Wasn't sure you'd recognize me.

376
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,581
Your face...

377
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,783
Is the same.

378
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,117
So why are you here?

379
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,451
What do you want?

380
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,587
I need to ask you
about Daniel Lapp.

381
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,057
After 17 years of silence,

382
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:23,591
Daniel Lapp.

383
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:29,762
What do you want to know?

384
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:32,431
- Has anyone heard from him
since he disappeared?

385
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:41,469
I know you're angry with me.

386
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,671
I think you should leave.

387
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,742
If it's any comfort,

388
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,576
I lived with what I did
every day.

389
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:53,676
Oh, that's interesting.

390
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:55,778
I lived with it too.

391
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,479
I still do.

392
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,047
- I don't expect you
to understand,

393
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:02,449
But I, um,
lost a lot too.

394
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,883
I know what you lost:

395
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:07,919
Your family, your future...

396
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,686
Our future.

397
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:16,224
You have every right
to hate me.

398
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:18,459
I don't hate anyone.

399
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:21,461
It's not our way.

400
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,795
Or have you forgotten that too?

401
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:26,464
I haven't forgotten anything.

402
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:31,633
I'm investigating a murder.

403
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,901
- The girl they found yesterday?
- Yeah.

404
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,470
- What does Daniel Lapp
have to do with that?

405
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:37,537
I don't know.

406
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,671
Just...

407
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,572
Has anyone heard from him?

408
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,109
If I tell you, you'll leave?

409
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,047
If that's what you want.

410
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:57,049
I think it would be best.

411
00:20:57,051 --> 00:21:00,518
I don't have any room for you
in my life anymore.

412
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,786
I'm married.

413
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,488
I know.

414
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,788
I have children.

415
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,657
- I know.
I saw them.

416
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,992
They're beautiful.

417
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,194
No one's heard from him.

418
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,163
Not in all these years.

419
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:21,498
Left without a word.

420
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:26,267
It happens more than we'd wish.

421
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,043
Do we know the age?

422
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:44,512
- Can you give us a statement,
please?

423
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:45,912
Do we have any suspects?

424
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:49,748
Morning, chief.

425
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,517
Messages?

426
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,683
Oh, and, um,

427
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,519
There's someone in your office.

428
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:04,557
Can I help you?

429
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,058
- Well, I don't know.
Can you?

430
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,226
You are?

431
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:11,161
- Tomasetti, BCI.

432
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,695
You rang.

433
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,596
- You ordinarily
make yourself at home

434
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,797
In other people's offices?

435
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,598
Thank you.
- Mm.

436
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,233
Well, I don't ordinarily
do a damn thing,

437
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,701
But if you want to review
your case with me,

438
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,803
I can offer you the benefits
of my dazzling insights.

439
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,072
Why don't you have a seat...

440
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:33,074
Kate?

441
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,209
- How about you call me
chief Burkholder?

442
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:36,977
Yeah, sure.
Whatever you say, chief.

443
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:39,045
Hey, Kate.

444
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:42,548
Sheriff, hey.

445
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,549
- BCI?
- Yeah.

446
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:45,715
Nate Detrick.

447
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:48,183
- Yeah, Tomasetti.
We've met.

448
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,585
- Oh, yeah?
Where?

449
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:51,319
- Last summer
at your swearing in.

450
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:53,987
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, great speech.

451
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,088
War stories.

452
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,857
- Yeah, he was a state trooper
in Mona.

453
00:22:58,859 --> 00:22:59,991
Hey, tell me.

454
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,559
That thing you said,
is it true?

455
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,760
You actually killed a bear?

456
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,328
Well...

457
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,663
I mean, it was
in the line of duty.

458
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:09,597
It was either him or me, so...

459
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,898
Didn't want to get shot,

460
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,566
It shouldn't have come down
to the station.

461
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:13,899
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Right, right.

462
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,235
That's the line I remember-

463
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:17,602
Station-with you.

464
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,670
That's funny.

465
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:23,639
Um, Kate, um...

466
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:25,106
Did the Mayor call?

467
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:26,107
This morning?

468
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,841
Um...

469
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:28,876
Yeah, three times.

470
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:29,976
Why?

471
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:31,277
Is that why you're here?
- No, no.

472
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,312
I mean, I was-
I was gonna drop by anyway.

473
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,880
- He wants your office
to take over the investigation?

474
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:36,948
No, no, no.

475
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,815
I... I set him straight on that.

476
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,716
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

477
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,717
That if you need the county
to do anything for you,

478
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:44,819
Run some legwork,
just, you know, let me know.

479
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:47,254
I'm there for you.
- Okay, Nate.

480
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,988
I appreciate that.

481
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,589
You got it.

482
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:52,891
Is there a file ready?

483
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,191
Of course there are.

484
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:55,725
You can get Mona
to make some copies for you.

485
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,160
- Auggie.
- Morning, sheriff.

486
00:23:57,162 --> 00:23:58,627
- Um...
- You got a minute?

487
00:23:58,629 --> 00:23:59,895
Yup.

488
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,330
Um, Auggie,
this is John Tomasetti, BCI.

489
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:03,630
- Ah!
- The Mayor.

490
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:05,865
- Glad you're here.
- Thanks.

491
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,032
So, Kate, uh,

492
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,133
The town council
would like

493
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:09,233
All public statements

494
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,635
On this situation
we're having

495
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:11,635
To be cleared through them.

496
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:14,203
Seriously?
Why?

497
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:16,205
- Well, they feel
that it's taken a long time

498
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,606
To develop the tourism here...

499
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:18,939
- Tourism?
That's their concern?

500
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:20,808
They're not more concerned
about catching the...

501
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,976
- Kate, all public statements
will be cleared through them

502
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,142
Until further notice.

503
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,177
Now, if you have
an issue with this-

504
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:26,645
I certainly do have an issue.

505
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,312
- Kate, your attitude,
it's not helping.

506
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:29,646
Okay?
It's not helping here.

507
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:30,814
Now, you were hired

508
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,014
Because of your
special sensitivity

509
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,649
To the dual nature
of our community.

510
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,016
We value our amish citizens

511
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,784
And not just because
of the revenue they bring us.

512
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,118
But we did not think
for a moment-

513
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,119
- What, that I would have
anything important to do?

514
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:42,288
- Oh, Kate, that is nonsense.
- Really, Auggie?

515
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,322
- Yes, you are being-
- whoa, whoa, Auggie.

516
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:46,624
Auggie, let's go grab
a cup of coffee, my friend.

517
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:47,824
I'm buying.

518
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,225
I'm sure Kate understands
the situation

519
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:50,659
A little better than we do.

520
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:55,229
Come on.

521
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:56,396
- Very good to meet you.
- Yeah.

522
00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:57,864
No, that was great.

523
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,103
There's no smoking in here.

524
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,637
Bad night?

525
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:14,073
These are the cold cases.

526
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:15,675
Terrific.

527
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:43,191
They all like this?

528
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,926
Yeah, just like that.

529
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,427
You feel like helping,
put that out.

530
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,170
- Yup, she put up
a hell of a fight.

531
00:26:03,172 --> 00:26:05,239
From the ligature marks
on her wrists and ankles,

532
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,340
She may even have broken free
a few times.

533
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:09,808
- How long you think
he might have had with her?

534
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,409
- Some of these cuts
are partially healed,

535
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:13,677
So I'd say...

536
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,145
A week at least,
probably more.

537
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:17,846
I wish these people

538
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:20,448
Would be a little less reluctant
to report somebody missing.

539
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,150
Yeah, well, these people

540
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:25,384
like to take care
of their own problems.

541
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,385
- Look. I'm sorry.
Kate, I didn't mean it that way.

542
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:30,020
- No, it's okay.
You're right.

543
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,221
The police didn't know.

544
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,156
I'd been gone
for almost six months.

545
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,856
- Huh.
- Police are english.

546
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,025
Hey.

547
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,160
- Hey,
you get through the files?

548
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:40,460
Yeah, I'll give you

549
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:43,395
a general profile of the guy
by tomorrow.

550
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:46,364
But a couple of things
pop for me right off.

551
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:49,700
All right.

552
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:52,201
There's no DNA anywhere,

553
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:55,969
No fluids, hair,
or skin flakes, nothing.

554
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,204
Yeah, nothing here either.

555
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:58,471
Right, so he's either

556
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:01,339
the luckiest serial killer
on record, or...

557
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:04,141
- He scrubbed down the body
postmortem.

558
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:07,210
- The question is,
why'd he start up again?

559
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:09,178
You know, there's five
dead girls in the '90s.

560
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,879
He stops.
Now he's back.

561
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,214
What's got him going?

562
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:17,717
Any thoughts, Kate?

563
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,387
He's a copycat.

564
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,288
- No, no,
the roman numeral thing,

565
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,089
I mean,
that was never made public.

566
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:28,390
- Yeah,
that could have been leaked.

567
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:30,224
Dozens of people
read that case file.

568
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:31,758
Well...

569
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,826
- That file was sitting
in an unlocked cabinet

570
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:34,059
For 17 years.

571
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,127
You can't tell me...

572
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:36,428
- Chief?
- Hey.

573
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,196
Did skid get to the Bishop?

574
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,363
Yeah, um...

575
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:44,366
Ezra and bonnie ausberger.

576
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:47,234
I know who they are.

577
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:48,502
They got a teenage daughter

578
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:51,204
who's been missing
a little over two weeks.

579
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,176
Hello, Ezra, Bonnie.

580
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:51,441
When was the last time
they saw their daughter?

581
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:54,109
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

582
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:57,044
Two weeks ago, Sunday.

583
00:28:57,046 --> 00:29:00,412
She said she was going
to her work after services.

584
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:01,616
She worked on the sabbath?

585
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:04,006
She worked on the sabbath?

586
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,016
She takes care of the babies

587
00:29:06,018 --> 00:29:09,152
so their mothers can go
to afternoon service.

588
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:11,253
- And she didn't show up
that day?

589
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:12,920
And she didn't show...

590
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:14,555
No.

591
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:19,391
- Why didn't you inform
the police before now?

592
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:23,560
- Our daughter
had become unruly.

593
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,862
We thought she had run away.

594
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,463
- It's not a matter
for the police.

595
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,799
That's an amish matter.

596
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:32,900
We went to the Bishop.

597
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:35,134
I understand.

598
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:37,803
We want to take

599
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,470
Our daughter now.

600
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:44,907
We want to bring her home.

601
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,476
I'm afraid we can't let
you take her yet.

602
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:52,111
Sorry.

603
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,289
All right,
what the hell was that?

604
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,890
Just what it looked like.

605
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:13,524
Well, it looks like they're
not speaking to you.

606
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:15,826
Why?
- Because I left.

607
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:17,993
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I should have put that together.

608
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:19,929
You're amish.
- Yes.

609
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,196
Well, what happened?

610
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,564
You want my life story?

611
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:24,331
- I'd settle
for how you ended up back here.

612
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,299
There was a job.

613
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:27,867
That's all I get?

614
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,601
- I grew up here,
left at 18,

615
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:31,335
Waitressed in cleveland
for a year,

616
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:32,903
Hated it,

617
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:35,305
Went to school,
took the police exam, passed,

618
00:30:35,307 --> 00:30:37,139
Made detective at 28.

619
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:38,340
I applied for the job here
last year

620
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:39,407
When chief mackie retired.

621
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:40,942
Are we good now?

622
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:43,243
Oh, man. I'm so glad.

623
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:45,477
Yeah, why is that?

624
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,845
No, it's just I thought

625
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,913
You were one
of those horrible...

626
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,315
You know, boring...

627
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:55,383
But you're a stiff
because you're amish.

628
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:56,585
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

629
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,152
Chief!

630
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:00,954
Uh, Bishop gave me something
to pass on to you.

631
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:03,322
He said someone slipped it
under his door this morning.

632
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,593
What's it say?

633
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,428
What's it say, Kate?

634
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,362
It says, uh,

635
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:18,865
"Katie Burkholder
knows who the killer is. "

636
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,632
Someone's idea of a joke.

637
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:23,400
- I wasn't aware the amish
were into that kind of humor.

638
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,370
You got things to do, right?

639
00:31:27,372 --> 00:31:28,370
Hmm?

640
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:29,872
Oh, sure.

641
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,440
Do you have a problem?

642
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:33,640
Yeah, something's going on,

643
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,375
And you're not
letting me in on it.

644
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,077
It's okay,
'cause whatever it is,

645
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,378
It's not gonna stay a secret
forong.

646
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
You're back.

647
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:09,196
I'm sorry.
I... Need your help.

648
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:12,331
Again?

649
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:16,400
Someone wrote a letter
to the Bishop about me.

650
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,234
I need to know who.

651
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,169
What are you asking me to do?

652
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:23,504
Go to him?

653
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,373
The Bishop?

654
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,207
You know he won't talk to me.

655
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:35,545
Does this have something to do
with Daniel Lapp?

656
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:38,381
- I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.

657
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:41,048
It's important?

658
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,150
Yeah.

659
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:48,320
I would tell you
if I could.

660
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:51,055
It's not like you
to hold your tongue.

661
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:55,257
No.

662
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,259
It's not.

663
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:07,264
I can't promise the Bishop
will tell me anything.

664
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,067
But I want to know
something first.

665
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:14,069
All right.

666
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,671
I want to know what happened.

667
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:19,172
Why did you leave?

668
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:21,407
Chief, what's your 20?

669
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:28,010
On patrol.

670
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:30,179
We got a hit from DRC.

671
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:33,547
Suspect?

672
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,215
How fast can you get here?

673
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:39,284
We're at 721 ridge road.

674
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:41,252
- On my way.
Ten minutes.

675
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,458
I didn't want to.

676
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,427
Then why?

677
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:55,294
It wasn't my choice.

678
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,695
Then whose?

679
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:02,265
Lucas, I can't tell you.

680
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,501
I can't.

681
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,585
An ex-con named Wayne Starkie,
a rapist.

682
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:37,320
He worked
the slaughterhouse in prison,

683
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:39,121
Has a thing for knives.

684
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:41,689
Go around to the back.

685
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:43,991
Key your walkie
when you get to the back door.

686
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:52,496
Mr. Starkie?

687
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:53,597
Yeah. Who is it?

688
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,564
Painters Mill PD.

689
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:55,598
Open the door.

690
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,232
- No way.
- Open up.

691
00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:59,100
Go away.

692
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:01,068
Mr. Starkie!

693
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,536
Hey, what are you doing?

694
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:04,703
Hey!
- Tomasetti?

695
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,705
Whoa!

696
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:09,007
Get down on the ground.

697
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,307
I said stay down.

698
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,641
- Son of a bitch!
- Stay down.

699
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:14,343
Get off of me.

700
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,443
- Stay down.
- Get off me.

701
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,445
Tomasetti.

702
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,680
- What?
You see the blood?

703
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,348
There's a joint on the table.
- Oh, it's tobacco, man.

704
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,016
- Yeah?
It looks like a joint to me.

705
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:27,617
Come on. Stand up.
- Ugh!

706
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,353
- Stand up. Stand up.
I said...

707
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,256
Oh! Oh.

708
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:37,324
Sit down.

709
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:39,725
Nichols. Nichols!

710
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:41,326
Get in here.

711
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:43,494
Hold him.

712
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:45,529
Where you been the last week?
- Here.

713
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:47,130
Can anyone back that up?

714
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:49,331
- What do I need an alibi for?
For what?

715
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,298
Back it up!

716
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,366
Okay, look.

717
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:54,634
I went hunting with my brother.

718
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:55,802
Take him in.

719
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,569
- What for?
I just told you.

720
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:59,370
- Possession of a firearm.
You're on parole.

721
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:01,372
What'd you do, forget?

722
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:02,773
- I didn't do nothing!
Come on!

723
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:05,574
- Secure the weapon.
- Come on!

724
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:09,476
Okay, first of all,
just to be clear,

725
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:11,045
That never happens again.

726
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,512
- What, you wanted to wait
for him to let us in?

727
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:14,280
- You broke half a dozen laws
in there,

728
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,114
Not to mention he's not our guy,
and you know it.

729
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:17,681
Do I?

730
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:19,417
- Dirty dishes,
dirty fingernails,

731
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:21,184
Smokes, drinks,
trips on his shoelaces.

732
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:22,217
What is wrong with you?

733
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,353
I'm fine.

734
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:26,254
No, you're not.

735
00:36:26,256 --> 00:36:28,722
I just need a drink.

736
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,359
That's how it is right now
every time the adrenaline hits.

737
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:39,262
- PTSD.
- Yeah, something like that.

738
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,296
You need a doctor?

739
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,464
No, just a drink.

740
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,399
- Why are you still
on active duty?

741
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:49,401
'cause I'm brilliant
at this stuff.

742
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:50,469
Can't you tell?

743
00:36:57,808 --> 00:37:00,175
I- I know I shouldn't be here.

744
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,375
So retire.

745
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:03,410
Yeah, well, I, uh...

746
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,645
I don't do too well at home.

747
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,448
They took pity on me
at the office.

748
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,217
They said I could hang there
until the new captain showed up.

749
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,684
But, uh, slaughterhouse
showed up first,

750
00:37:15,686 --> 00:37:18,252
So here I am.

751
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:23,389
What happened to you?

752
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,257
- You heard of me.
I'm Tomasetti.

753
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:29,393
Tomasetti, cincinnati.

754
00:37:29,395 --> 00:37:32,861
It was in all the papers.

755
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:35,429
All right, I wanted
to make a name for myself

756
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:36,831
When I made detective,

757
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,199
So when I got my shield,
I took down joey campanella.

758
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,300
Does that ring a bell?

759
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:42,568
- Yeah, okay.
I remember that.

760
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,369
- Yeah.
Godfather to half of ohio.

761
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:48,137
He said he would get even
with me,

762
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,239
And I knew that he would try,

763
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:53,540
So I wore kevlar every day.

764
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:57,443
But he faked me out.

765
00:37:57,445 --> 00:37:59,377
He didn't go after me.

766
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,715
He went after your family.

767
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,717
Yeah, my wife...

768
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,419
And, um...

769
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:13,420
My kid.

770
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,256
They never made an arrest
for that.

771
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:27,294
Get me another.
- Coming right up.

772
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:32,598
I'm sorry.

773
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,733
- I made sure I was first
in the door

774
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:36,334
For about five years
after that.

775
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,468
You know, there was
every high-speed chase,

776
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,837
Shootout,
hostage situation.

777
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,438
I was there.

778
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,206
Trying to get yourself killed?

779
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,407
Something like that.

780
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,809
But it didn't work.
I'm still here.

781
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,879
What's left of me.

782
00:38:58,448 --> 00:38:59,615
Okay, look,
I won't blame you

783
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:00,749
If you don't believe a word

784
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,150
That I have to say
about this case,

785
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:03,217
but I know one thing:

786
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,451
This is not a copycat.

787
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:05,819
Based on what?

788
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,353
- Everything:
The roman numerals,

789
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:08,454
The cuts to the carotid artery.

790
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:09,487
They're all scrubbed.

791
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:10,755
I mean, a copycat would need

792
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:14,423
A set of instructions with him
each time.

793
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:16,192
So what does the FBI
have to say?

794
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:18,927
- We've got the vcap file,
and there's not much there.

795
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,861
- Yeah, well, my gut says
he's been all over the country.

796
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:24,164
Because of the gap
in the numbers?

797
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:28,266
I looked.
I looked. Nothing much is up.

798
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:30,467
Chief, we need you now.

799
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,472
- Excuse me, please.
Skid.

800
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:39,506
What's going on, here?

801
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,674
Uh, parents. Gymnastics meet.

802
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:44,309
- Starting when?
- Don't know. Ten minutes ago?

803
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:50,779
No.

804
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:53,247
Oh, no.
- Kate.

805
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:55,483
He's escalating.
- Tell me about it.

806
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:57,184
T.J.!
- Now, hold on.

807
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,817
He did this so he can
watch these people react.

808
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:00,186
He's here.

809
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:01,553
I know it doesn't match
his m. O.,

810
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:02,887
But it's dead-on
for his profile.

811
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:04,254
He's here.

812
00:40:04,256 --> 00:40:05,455
Is the Mayor on his way?

813
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:06,923
- Yeah, he's outside.
- Keep him there.

814
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:09,591
- What do I say to him?
- Just do it.

815
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:12,393
Skid, lock the doors.
No one leaves.

816
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:14,460
Nichols, anyone
within 200 yards of here,

817
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:15,862
Bring them inside,
no exceptions.

818
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:17,729
And I want all number plates
within a mile of here.

819
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,497
Got it, chief.

820
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:21,499
- What's going on?
- He's here.

821
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,733
- Who?
- The killer. He's here.

822
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,538
Nobody leaves this place.

823
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,272
I want to set up a perimeter.

824
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:35,307
Nobody leaves this building.

825
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,942
Stay outside?

826
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:39,343
Kate! Kate!
- Auggie. Auggie.

827
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:40,743
- Please let me know.
- Auggie, please.

828
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:42,678
I need to ask you to back off
for another second.

829
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,780
Just stay here for one second.
We just need...

830
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:47,281
Auggie.

831
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:50,282
Oh, my god.

832
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,750
Oh, my god.
No, no, no.

833
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:54,419
Oh, my god.

834
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:56,220
Oh, god, Amanda. Honey.
- Auggie. Auggie, please.

835
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:58,221
We need to-you can't right now.
- Get away from me. Get away.

836
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:01,423
Get away from me!

837
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,525
Look what he did to my daughter.

838
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:05,825
- Auggie, no.
- Honey, no.

839
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:09,261
Oh, god.
- Hey, hey, hey.

840
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,529
Come on, Auggie. She's gone.

841
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:11,662
No, no, no, no, no.

842
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:12,563
- Come on.
Let us do our job.

843
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:14,531
- No, no!
Please, let me-

844
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:16,265
No, please!

845
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:28,807
- There are no more details
provided at this time.

846
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:31,742
We are waiting for a statement.

847
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:33,710
- I want to know why we're
being treated like criminals.

848
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:35,477
Please, just bear with us.

849
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:37,778
You'll get to go home as soon
as everyone's been processed.

850
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,913
- I realize this isn't what
you people want to do right now.

851
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,781
Just hang in there.
- Your killer isn't here.

852
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,983
You know as well as I do
the killer's amish.

853
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:46,384
- Every one of them
knows how to butcher.

854
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:47,884
They slaughter animals
in their backyard.

855
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:50,486
Mr. Waring,
I need you to calm down.

856
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:51,520
Well, they do.

857
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:52,488
No, sir, they don't.

858
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:55,656
Yeah?

859
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:56,624
FBI's on line two,

860
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:57,658
Returning your call.

861
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,259
Great. Give me a sec.

862
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:01,760
- All right,
I'll handle the natives.

863
00:42:01,762 --> 00:42:04,462
Look, I'll get you out of here
just as soon as possible.

864
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:05,862
- Okay, I need
everything you've got:

865
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,397
Postmortem, carved numerals,

866
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,031
Any woman killed
by exsanguination.

867
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:12,367
No, anywhere, any state.

868
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,533
Wait.
You're just doing it now?

869
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:14,668
I called you two days ago.

870
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,003
FBI?

871
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:18,703
Yes! Now.

872
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:21,505
Yeah, not sure you'd win

873
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:23,340
A popularity contest
right now.

874
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:25,408
I am aware.

875
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,541
- So why does someone
in this town

876
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,443
Think you know
who the killer is?

877
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:31,312
What?

878
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:34,413
- Who wrote the letter
to the Bishop?

879
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,682
This is what you want
to talk about?

880
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:39,616
Mm-hmm.

881
00:42:39,618 --> 00:42:41,785
It's gossip, John.

882
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,352
The amish curse:

883
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,553
No televisions,
no radio,

884
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:45,553
So they gossip.

885
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:46,855
They send letters to the Bishop.

886
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:48,622
That's what they do.

887
00:42:48,624 --> 00:42:51,557
That's your answer?

888
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:52,758
Yeah, that's my answer.

889
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,495
- You know,
it might not be smart

890
00:42:58,497 --> 00:43:00,763
To underestimate me, Kate.

891
00:43:02,032 --> 00:43:03,631
I don't underestimate anyone.

892
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,804
That national search

893
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:14,605
For the slaughterhouse killer
continues.

894
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:16,873
Police are releasing
no information.

895
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:51,961
Katie.

896
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,797
Sorry, I didn't mean
to frighten you.

897
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,564
No, it's all right.

898
00:43:57,566 --> 00:43:59,900
What are you doing here?

899
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:01,600
I've been to see your brother.

900
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:04,569
He told me...

901
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:06,870
About Lapp.

902
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:09,739
He...

903
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:12,874
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He what-he what?

904
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,942
What Lapp did to you, Katie.

905
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,611
Why didn't you come to me?

906
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:22,413
Why didn't you tell me?

907
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:28,584
I have wanted to, Lucas.

908
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:31,785
I'm so sorry I didn't.

909
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:33,687
I would have stood by you.

910
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:36,722
You went through this all alone.

911
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:39,390
I would have done anything
for you, Katie.

912
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:42,792
I know that.

913
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:45,394
But you know what?
I'm all right now.

914
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:47,395
It's done.

915
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:52,032
It isn't, Katie.

916
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:54,999
You have to go see
your brother.

917
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:56,701
Why?

918
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,936
The Bishop,

919
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:02,505
He doesn't know
who wrote the letter.

920
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:04,639
You went to the Bishop?

921
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:06,407
As you asked.

922
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:08,775
He said whoever did,

923
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:10,843
They didn't come
by car or buggy.

924
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:14,545
I figured they must have come
through his back fields.

925
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:17,981
There were tracks.

926
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:20,649
I followed them
to your brother's farm.

927
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:25,119
That's not possible.

928
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:28,587
You asked me to help you, Katie.

929
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:45,498
I'll be right back.

930
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:49,033
You missed me.

931
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:56,605
Shh!

932
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,006
Shh.

933
00:46:04,944 --> 00:46:06,010
What?

934
00:46:06,012 --> 00:46:07,677
What is it?

935
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:14,182
What happened?

936
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:16,884
Did you write the Bishop
about me?

937
00:46:16,886 --> 00:46:17,951
What?

938
00:46:17,953 --> 00:46:19,652
You wrote the Bishop
a letter

939
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,787
about me and Daniel Lapp.

940
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:23,187
What are you talking about?

941
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:24,688
Don't lie to me, Jacob.

942
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,689
We know it came from you.

943
00:46:26,691 --> 00:46:27,924
Lie to you?

944
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:49,470
This is my business.

945
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:50,604
I'm finished.

946
00:46:50,606 --> 00:46:53,973
All this silence,
it never ends.

947
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:58,042
This is how you want to live?

948
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,846
I wrote the Bishop.

949
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:06,214
How else can this end?

950
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:07,915
I look at you.

951
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:09,683
I see this thing,

952
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:10,850
This terrible thing,

953
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:13,118
Eating at you each day.

954
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,853
You don't see
what it's doing to him.

955
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:17,455
It tortures him.

956
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:18,922
- Tortures him?
How?

957
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:20,689
Because he knows
it's torturing you.

958
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:21,690
How would he know?

959
00:47:21,692 --> 00:47:24,759
He barely looks at me.

960
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,726
What do you expect him to do?

961
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:29,195
You're under the ban.

962
00:47:29,197 --> 00:47:31,830
You think he has no feelings,

963
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,698
No love for his sister?

964
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:41,802
He looks for you every morning.

965
00:47:41,804 --> 00:47:43,604
You don't know that?

966
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:45,538
Every morning.

967
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,208
Is that true?

968
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:00,681
I remembered...

969
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:03,950
when I was speaking
with Sarah...

970
00:48:03,952 --> 00:48:06,885
something.

971
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:10,887
When dad came home that night,
he told mom,

972
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:14,656
"I put him
in the deepest place,

973
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,090
A place no one
will ever find him. "

974
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,061
Maybe that will help.

975
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,697
I don't know.

976
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,772
You know,
I remember now why I chose you.

977
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,176
- I wasn't wrong.
- Shh.

978
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:48,544
No, I was just...

979
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:49,744
Katie, for once,

980
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:52,513
Just... Shush.

981
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:56,582
You're english now.

982
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:45,982
Looking for something?

983
00:50:47,718 --> 00:50:49,685
John.

984
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:52,186
Hey, yeah, um...

985
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,921
I got a tip
on an illegal dumping site.

986
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:57,056
I thought
I would check it out.

987
00:50:57,058 --> 00:51:00,792
Right. Yeah.

988
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:02,659
How about I profile you

989
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:04,226
just for the fun of it?

990
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,828
You ready?

991
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,263
Not particularly.

992
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,765
Yeah? Too bad.

993
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,766
You left the amish community
when you were 18.

994
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:16,868
Something happened,

995
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,336
Something your family
couldn't deal with,

996
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,003
I mean, something
you couldn't deal with,

997
00:51:20,005 --> 00:51:22,771
So you bolted.

998
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,340
Am I right so far?

999
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:28,342
Right.

1000
00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:31,377
So what's in that hole there?

1001
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,278
Or should I say who?

1002
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:42,684
Daniel Lapp.

1003
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,786
Who's that?

1004
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:49,722
A man who hurt me.

1005
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:51,222
And who put him there?

1006
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:52,790
My father.

1007
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,391
- Right. So he killed him.
Why?

1008
00:51:54,393 --> 00:51:56,792
No, he, um...

1009
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:58,327
He didn't kill him.

1010
00:51:58,329 --> 00:51:59,894
Who did?

1011
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,266
I did.

1012
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:12,268
Oh, Kate.

1013
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,803
He raped me.

1014
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,040
Why'd you come here tonight?

1015
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:22,675
- To make sure
that he was dead.

1016
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:25,076
You didn't know?

1017
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:32,348
I thought he was our killer.

1018
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,715
Why?

1019
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,824
That's why.

1020
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:49,725
Oh, god.

1021
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,730
Tell me.

1022
00:52:57,732 --> 00:52:59,798
He, um...

1023
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,932
He worked on our farm
for years.

1024
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:15,745
I killed a man.

1025
00:54:15,747 --> 00:54:17,212
In self-defense.

1026
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:20,014
And now it's all
gonna come out.

1027
00:54:20,016 --> 00:54:22,949
Do you know what that's gonna do
to my family?

1028
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:25,718
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

1029
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,786
I'm on your side, remember?

1030
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:31,488
I mean, somebody's got to be.

1031
00:54:35,157 --> 00:54:36,991
Kate, you can trust me.

1032
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,028
You'll have to figure that out
on your own, I guess.

1033
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:50,100
That's nice.

1034
00:54:50,102 --> 00:54:51,166
Thank you.

1035
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:54,268
You made it?

1036
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,937
Yeah, uh...

1037
00:54:56,939 --> 00:54:58,871
When I miss my family,
I quilt.

1038
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,808
You made the one in
the living room too, right?

1039
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:09,444
Yeah, and a few more upstairs.

1040
00:55:09,446 --> 00:55:11,345
Well, you must miss
your family a lot.

1041
00:55:11,347 --> 00:55:13,047
Yeah.

1042
00:55:13,049 --> 00:55:17,416
Well, I don't have a whole lot
left from my childhood.

1043
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:19,784
Actually, I don't have anything.

1044
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:23,920
After I left,
that was pretty much it.

1045
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:29,357
You know, when my mom died,

1046
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,959
I didn't even get
to go see her.

1047
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:37,795
I got a call
while I was on stakeout:

1048
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:40,163
"She's gone. "

1049
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:43,132
What'd you do?

1050
00:55:43,134 --> 00:55:44,166
What to do?

1051
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:45,366
I...

1052
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:48,935
Sat crying half the night.

1053
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:52,238
And then I went
and made my bust.

1054
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,305
I'm a cop, so...

1055
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:20,955
Tomasetti.

1056
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:22,790
Yeah.

1057
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:24,323
Did you just kiss me?

1058
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:27,859
Damn.
I... I think I did.

1059
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:30,127
Just, uh...

1060
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:33,997
Just checking.

1061
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:36,565
How'd it go?

1062
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:39,267
Yeah, it was okay.

1063
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:43,536
Yeah, well, I'm, uh...

1064
00:56:43,538 --> 00:56:44,537
I'm a little rusty.

1065
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:47,905
It's all right.
Me too.

1066
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,141
I should go.

1067
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,844
Yeah.

1068
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,912
Are you sure?

1069
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:04,482
Good.

1070
00:57:04,484 --> 00:57:07,984
You're not sure.
All right.

1071
00:57:07,986 --> 00:57:09,251
I... I'll see you tomorrow.

1072
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:22,493
In Painters Mill, Ohio,
two bodies have been found,

1073
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:24,327
The first, a teen from
the amish community.

1074
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:26,429
We go now to sue
in Painters Mill.

1075
00:57:26,431 --> 00:57:27,930
I have confirmation now,

1076
00:57:27,932 --> 00:57:29,564
Sources close
to the investigation confirm...

1077
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:31,065
Get me a list

1078
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,332
Of all the moving companies
in the state,

1079
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:33,934
And give me the names
of their clients

1080
00:57:33,936 --> 00:57:35,167
Who left this area

1081
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:36,569
Within six months
of the killings in '95.

1082
00:57:36,571 --> 00:57:38,336
- Okay, and cross-check it
with a list of people

1083
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:40,003
Who've moved back
to the area recently?

1084
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:41,839
Exactly.

1085
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:43,873
Hey, Kate.

1086
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,308
- Hey, Nate.
What's up?

1087
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:49,210
- I'm really sorry
I have to give this to you.

1088
00:57:49,212 --> 00:57:51,911
What is it?

1089
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,145
- I tried to speak
with the Mayor,

1090
00:57:53,147 --> 00:57:54,446
But he's just...

1091
00:57:54,448 --> 00:57:58,014
Out of his mind with grief.

1092
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,016
I have to escort you out.

1093
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:03,251
What happened?

1094
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:07,588
I've, um...

1095
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,590
Been fired.

1096
00:58:10,592 --> 00:58:13,124
- Well, then somebody's
not thinking right.

1097
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:15,326
- Uh, Mona, you and T.J.
Have some work to do.

1098
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:18,994
I suggest you go and do it.

1099
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,329
- I can give you
a couple of minutes

1100
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:23,897
To gather your things
from your desk, but...

1101
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:25,065
- What do they think
I'm gonna do,

1102
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:26,932
Vandalize the place?

1103
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:29,100
So who's going
to run the investigation?

1104
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:32,936
Well, for now, I will.

1105
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:36,205
- Well, let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

1106
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:38,907
- I really appreciate that,
Kate.

1107
00:58:38,909 --> 00:58:40,140
Hey, look,
I'll speak to the council

1108
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,408
Within a week or two.

1109
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,343
Of course,
I can't make any promises.

1110
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:49,213
But I'll try
to get you reinstated.

1111
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,081
And-and listen.
I hate to ask you this.

1112
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:54,049
But just bring
the car back tomorrow,

1113
00:58:54,051 --> 00:58:55,083
If you don't mind.

1114
00:58:57,486 --> 00:58:58,886
Right. Yeah.

1115
00:59:31,474 --> 00:59:32,573
Kate.

1116
00:59:38,478 --> 00:59:41,479
- Please tell me
you didn't do this to me.

1117
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:44,214
- Oh, Kate.
No.

1118
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:46,615
- You told no one anything
that I told you last night?

1119
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:48,483
No.

1120
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:49,983
Come on. I swear.

1121
00:59:49,985 --> 00:59:52,219
Auggie Brock
has lost it completely and-

1122
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,452
Yeah.

1123
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:02,258
- Hey, I'm gonna stay here
until it's done.

1124
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,492
And when the-

1125
01:00:03,494 --> 01:00:04,660
The dust settles,

1126
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:06,360
They're gonna come
to their senses.

1127
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:09,195
No, they won't.

1128
01:00:09,197 --> 01:00:11,230
And you know it.

1129
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,665
- Well, at least I know
I'm not leaving here

1130
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,933
Until... You're okay.

1131
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:23,204
Come here.

1132
01:00:27,474 --> 01:00:28,608
Closer.

1133
01:00:35,279 --> 01:00:36,612
Closer.

1134
01:00:42,985 --> 01:00:45,518
You can come closer.

1135
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:53,556
What are you looking at?

1136
01:00:53,558 --> 01:00:56,959
- I'm trying to picture you
as an amish girl.

1137
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:58,526
Oh.

1138
01:00:58,528 --> 01:01:00,160
Is that so difficult?

1139
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:03,162
Well...

1140
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:04,263
You're a little, um...

1141
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:07,065
Assertive for an amish girl?

1142
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:09,566
Yeah, that's a good word.

1143
01:01:09,568 --> 01:01:11,467
I was gonna say pushy.

1144
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:19,672
Well, I never said
I was perfect, so...

1145
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:21,373
You're a hell of a cop.

1146
01:01:24,176 --> 01:01:28,078
Thank you.

1147
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,646
- That's about as good as I get
with the compliments.

1148
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,080
Understood.

1149
01:01:32,082 --> 01:01:33,648
And...

1150
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:37,483
I'm probably gonna
screw this up.

1151
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,384
Me too.

1152
01:02:15,707 --> 01:02:17,141
John.

1153
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,343
John.

1154
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:22,077
Mm.

1155
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,345
You awake?

1156
01:02:24,347 --> 01:02:25,780
I've been thinking...

1157
01:02:25,782 --> 01:02:27,314
Uh-oh.

1158
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,082
About our guy...

1159
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:31,082
Oh.

1160
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:32,517
And how he would have done it,

1161
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:35,386
How he would have gotten
those girls to come with him.

1162
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:37,387
Okay, I'm listening.

1163
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:39,588
- Well, he had to be driving
in broad daylight.

1164
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,789
Right?
- Mm-hmm.

1165
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:44,324
- He sees a girl.
He rolls down his window.

1166
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:46,126
And she's not scared.

1167
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:48,293
- Which you'd expect
after the first murder.

1168
01:02:48,295 --> 01:02:50,094
- Exactly,
the Mayor's daughter

1169
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:51,596
Should have gone
running for the hills.

1170
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:53,130
But she didn't.

1171
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,097
- So it's got to be someone
they both knew.

1172
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:56,332
Or trusted.

1173
01:02:56,334 --> 01:02:58,700
- Someone they both
felt safe with.

1174
01:02:58,702 --> 01:03:01,068
- Yeah, or because
of their position,

1175
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:06,204
Like a fireman or a minister
or a cop.

1176
01:03:06,206 --> 01:03:07,505
I mean, let's not forget,

1177
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:09,073
He's got a real good handle
on forensics.

1178
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:10,240
One of my guys?

1179
01:03:10,242 --> 01:03:12,808
- You know,
just a cop in the area,

1180
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:15,244
You know, or maybe
a doctor who grew up here

1181
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:17,111
And is comfortable
with the amish community.

1182
01:03:21,615 --> 01:03:23,381
Are you expecting someone?

1183
01:03:27,153 --> 01:03:28,618
Chief?

1184
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,653
Hey, chief, you there?

1185
01:03:32,588 --> 01:03:34,455
- Hey.
- Sorry to bother you.

1186
01:03:34,457 --> 01:03:36,489
I just wanted to, uh...

1187
01:03:36,491 --> 01:03:40,192
Can I come in?
- Yeah.

1188
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:43,528
What's up?
- Uh, we made an arrest.

1189
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,761
What?

1190
01:03:44,763 --> 01:03:46,263
Yeah.

1191
01:03:46,265 --> 01:03:47,830
- Who?
- An amish man.

1192
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:49,464
Samuel Hershberger.

1193
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:51,732
Samuel Hershberger?

1194
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:53,300
That's not right.

1195
01:03:53,302 --> 01:03:54,434
Oh.

1196
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:56,102
We got a pile of evidence.

1197
01:03:56,104 --> 01:03:58,537
We got clothing from the victims
found in his barn

1198
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:02,338
And blood from the victims
on his floor.

1199
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,473
You don't buy it.

1200
01:04:03,475 --> 01:04:04,541
No, I know Samuel.

1201
01:04:04,543 --> 01:04:06,141
We grew up together.

1202
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,209
When we were kids,
he used to hand-tame wild birds.

1203
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,210
I saw him bottle-feed
a litter of kittens.

1204
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:11,611
I mean, he might be
a little simple,

1205
01:04:11,613 --> 01:04:13,479
But there's not a cruel bone
in that man's body.

1206
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,613
I'm telling you.

1207
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,415
John, if there's evidence,
it's been planted.

1208
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:19,383
- Hold on.
Jay?

1209
01:04:19,385 --> 01:04:21,517
- Sorry, chief,
I thought you'd want to know.

1210
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:22,785
- Jay, wait.
- Do you want me to go?

1211
01:04:22,787 --> 01:04:24,486
- No, you're fine.
- Yeah, who ordered this?

1212
01:04:24,488 --> 01:04:25,753
Where is this coming from?

1213
01:04:25,755 --> 01:04:28,788
Yeah, I understand, but...

1214
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,390
Yeah.

1215
01:04:31,392 --> 01:04:33,192
I've just been ordered back to BCI.

1216
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:34,325
- When?
- Now.

1217
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:35,860
They want me there at noon.
- Why?

1218
01:04:35,862 --> 01:04:38,095
- It seems like
the city council called them,

1219
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:39,662
Ended my assignment,

1220
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:42,464
Suspect in custody.

1221
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:44,665
You know, that's not procedure.
- No.

1222
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:47,166
Someone is working
really hard here.

1223
01:04:47,168 --> 01:04:48,835
T.J., who brought Samuel in?

1224
01:04:48,837 --> 01:04:50,735
Who arrested him?
Who found the evidence?

1225
01:04:50,737 --> 01:04:52,703
- Uh, Nichols.
It was Nichols.

1226
01:04:52,705 --> 01:04:54,270
Nichols?

1227
01:04:54,272 --> 01:04:57,473
Nichols was an army ranger
for 15 years, right?

1228
01:04:57,475 --> 01:04:59,373
- It can't be Nichols.
He just moved here.

1229
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,342
- Right.
So he's a copycat.

1230
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,376
We just ruled that out.

1231
01:05:03,378 --> 01:05:04,710
T.J., go to judge rogers

1232
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:06,345
And see if you can slow down
the arraignment.

1233
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:07,879
- Got it.
- We'll be right behind you.

1234
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,618
Mona?
- Chief.

1235
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,685
What's up?

1236
01:05:17,687 --> 01:05:19,120
Thought you should know.

1237
01:05:19,122 --> 01:05:20,687
Samuel Hershberger
just hung himself.

1238
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:26,691
Yeah, she should be coming
up here in just a second.

1239
01:05:26,693 --> 01:05:28,258
Oh, here she comes.
Here she comes.

1240
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,193
- Chief Burkholder.
- Chief Burkholder.

1241
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:31,627
- Chief Burkholder.
- Here, please.

1242
01:05:31,629 --> 01:05:33,695
- What can you tell us
about this Hershberger?

1243
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,867
- Oh, my god, Kate.
It is just chaos in here.

1244
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:43,868
- Okay, listen,
don't say a word to anyone,

1245
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,669
But I need you to check
Nichols' army records.

1246
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:46,870
Detective Nichols.

1247
01:05:46,872 --> 01:05:49,204
Skid.

1248
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:51,606
- I'd swear I had him
take off his shoelaces.

1249
01:05:51,608 --> 01:05:52,707
I mean, I'd have sworn.

1250
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:55,175
But...

1251
01:05:55,177 --> 01:05:56,876
I fell asleep.

1252
01:05:56,878 --> 01:05:58,711
- Do you know
where he was stationed?

1253
01:05:58,713 --> 01:06:00,745
Uh, I think it was Georgia.

1254
01:06:00,747 --> 01:06:02,713
Yeah, Georgia.
- Okay, good. Start there.

1255
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:04,380
And double-check
where he grew up.

1256
01:06:04,382 --> 01:06:07,682
- When-when did this happen?
- 1:00, 1:15.

1257
01:06:07,684 --> 01:06:10,251
I couldn't have been out
more than ten minutes.

1258
01:06:10,253 --> 01:06:11,385
Of course you can quote me.

1259
01:06:11,387 --> 01:06:13,319
Just do me a favor, okay?

1260
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:15,521
I mean, he's a good cop,

1261
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:18,456
And I don't want
to throw the guy under the bus.

1262
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:21,558
And he's gonna retire
in two months.

1263
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,360
Yeah.

1264
01:06:24,362 --> 01:06:26,661
Shoelaces.
Can you believe that?

1265
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:27,895
Who else was here?

1266
01:06:29,565 --> 01:06:31,164
Nichols, uh...

1267
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:34,599
Nichols.

1268
01:06:34,601 --> 01:06:35,900
- All right,
I'm here if you need me.

1269
01:06:35,902 --> 01:06:38,568
Right, anytime.

1270
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:41,436
You too.

1271
01:06:43,307 --> 01:06:44,939
Wow.
Have you heard?

1272
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:47,807
Yeah, it's, um...

1273
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:49,341
Seems like all I have to do
is leave

1274
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,709
And the case gets solved.

1275
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:53,745
- Well, we had more
than a little luck,

1276
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:55,646
Both good and bad.

1277
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:56,913
I wish to hell
you'd have been here

1278
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:58,915
Through the whole thing,
Kate.

1279
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:02,816
What a mess.

1280
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:08,187
So what can I do for you?

1281
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:09,587
Samuel Hershberger?

1282
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:12,522
Nate, I don't think
he could have done this.

1283
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:14,524
Why would you say that?

1284
01:07:14,526 --> 01:07:15,724
Because I knew him.

1285
01:07:15,726 --> 01:07:17,525
And he was so devout.
There's no way-

1286
01:07:17,527 --> 01:07:18,793
Kate, how devout can a man be

1287
01:07:18,795 --> 01:07:21,395
That rapes and bleeds
12 young women?

1288
01:07:21,397 --> 01:07:22,762
- But he didn't do it,
not any of it.

1289
01:07:22,764 --> 01:07:23,930
That's my point.

1290
01:07:23,932 --> 01:07:25,463
- Well,
why would he hang himself?

1291
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:26,765
- He didn't.
Someone else must have.

1292
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:28,299
Kate, Kate.

1293
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:30,600
Don't do this to yourself.

1294
01:07:30,602 --> 01:07:31,801
Okay?

1295
01:07:31,803 --> 01:07:33,635
You're a better cop than this.

1296
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:35,204
And you got some history here.

1297
01:07:35,206 --> 01:07:36,571
Maybe that's why you missed it.

1298
01:07:36,573 --> 01:07:37,772
- Nate.
- No, listen.

1299
01:07:37,774 --> 01:07:39,439
Listen, it's...

1300
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:41,674
It's hard to accept
when it's one of your own.

1301
01:07:41,676 --> 01:07:43,308
I understand that.

1302
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,876
I mean, I've got a soft spot
for your people too.

1303
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:47,277
Ever since I was a kid,

1304
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:48,477
Every time I would see
one of them,

1305
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:49,879
I couldn't help but think,
"you know what?

1306
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:52,414
That just might be the way
to live life. "

1307
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:53,681
They're good people, Kate.

1308
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:55,883
- That's right.
You grew up in the area.

1309
01:07:55,885 --> 01:08:00,419
- I sure did.
I was born and raised here.

1310
01:08:00,421 --> 01:08:02,420
- And then you went and spent
all that time in Mona

1311
01:08:02,422 --> 01:08:06,223
And, um...
And shot a bear.

1312
01:08:06,225 --> 01:08:08,791
- You need to think about this
a little bit, okay?

1313
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,892
Just clear your head.
Let it go.

1314
01:08:11,894 --> 01:08:13,393
Go find yourself in Mona

1315
01:08:13,395 --> 01:08:14,860
And shoot a bear or two.

1316
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:16,862
Yeah.

1317
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:18,830
You know what?

1318
01:08:18,832 --> 01:08:21,699
I'm gonna write you one hell
of a recommendation letter.

1319
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:23,800
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

1320
01:08:23,802 --> 01:08:25,968
No problem.
Listen.

1321
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,769
I wish you the best of luck,
okay?

1322
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,804
Yeah, I wish you luck too.

1323
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,439
I got to go clear my car out,
so...

1324
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,839
Hey.

1325
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:34,940
No hurry.

1326
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:44,946
- Mona, forget Georgia.
Bring up Mona.

1327
01:08:44,948 --> 01:08:46,347
What? Why?

1328
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:47,881
- Let me see every murder
by exsanguination

1329
01:08:47,883 --> 01:08:49,382
In the last 20 years.

1330
01:08:49,384 --> 01:08:50,783
- No, we checked that, Kate,
Nichols and me.

1331
01:08:50,785 --> 01:08:52,284
There aren't any.

1332
01:08:52,286 --> 01:08:53,751
- Just get me an officer
from the Mona state pd

1333
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:55,286
On the phone.

1334
01:08:55,288 --> 01:08:57,587
Patch him through to my cell.
- Okay. Okay.

1335
01:08:57,589 --> 01:08:58,954
Kate, Kate.

1336
01:08:58,956 --> 01:09:00,589
There's something
I need to talk to-

1337
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:01,823
- Nichols, give me a sec.
One sec.

1338
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:02,924
- Kate, I have Mona.
- Thanks.

1339
01:09:02,926 --> 01:09:04,891
Mona, I hear him fine.

1340
01:09:04,893 --> 01:09:06,926
Lieutenant,
this is Kate Burkholder,

1341
01:09:06,928 --> 01:09:08,995
Chief of police
in Painters Mill, Ohio.

1342
01:09:08,997 --> 01:09:10,996
I'm working a homicide,
murder by exsanguination.

1343
01:09:10,998 --> 01:09:12,963
We checked the lists on vcap,

1344
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:15,431
And there are no entries
for Mona.

1345
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:17,833
- Murder by what's that?
- Exsanguination.

1346
01:09:17,835 --> 01:09:19,468
And what is that?

1347
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,035
Bled to death.

1348
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:22,369
Oh.

1349
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:23,937
We don't use that term up here.

1350
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:25,738
What do you use?

1351
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,872
Bleeding out.

1352
01:09:26,874 --> 01:09:28,273
- Well, then none
of our searches

1353
01:09:28,275 --> 01:09:30,007
Would have come up
with anything.

1354
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:31,541
Well, have you had any cases?

1355
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:33,442
Could be as far back
as the '90s.

1356
01:09:33,444 --> 01:09:35,011
- Bled-out homicides?
We've had a few.

1357
01:09:35,013 --> 01:09:36,811
- Well, tell me,
have any of them had

1358
01:09:36,813 --> 01:09:39,780
Any sort of carved figure
on the abdomen?

1359
01:09:39,782 --> 01:09:41,648
Oh, I can check.

1360
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:44,816
You know what?

1361
01:09:44,818 --> 01:09:45,950
I think I remember
a case like that.

1362
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:48,385
Vic had kind of an "x"
cut into her.

1363
01:09:48,387 --> 01:09:51,487
- A young woman?
- Yeah, far as I remember.

1364
01:09:51,489 --> 01:09:52,588
- That's not an "X."
it's a 10.

1365
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:53,888
It's a roman numeral.

1366
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:00,760
Chief?

1367
01:10:00,762 --> 01:10:03,595
Burkholder?

1368
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:05,529
What happened to my line?

1369
01:10:32,047 --> 01:10:33,980
- Yes, sir.
I'm trying to get her back, sir.

1370
01:10:33,982 --> 01:10:35,514
Mona, have you seen Kate?

1371
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:36,882
She was on a call, but...

1372
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:38,616
Yes, sir,
I'll get chief Burkholder

1373
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:40,350
for you right away.

1374
01:10:40,352 --> 01:10:41,584
Who is that?

1375
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:43,652
- It's a police lieutenant
from Mona.

1376
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:45,653
- Alaska?
- No, sorry, sir.

1377
01:10:45,655 --> 01:10:47,555
Her line is still busy.

1378
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:51,557
- You know what?
I'll take that.

1379
01:10:51,559 --> 01:10:53,758
Yeah, hi.
This is John Tomasetti, BCI.

1380
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,994
What's this in reference to?

1381
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:59,062
What year was that?

1382
01:10:59,064 --> 01:11:01,063
Well, was the case ever-

1383
01:11:01,065 --> 01:11:03,432
It wasn't closed?

1384
01:11:03,434 --> 01:11:04,932
Yeah.

1385
01:11:04,934 --> 01:11:07,000
Alaska.

1386
01:11:07,002 --> 01:11:08,068
Where's Detrick?

1387
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,001
I don't know.

1388
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:05,703
Has anyone seen
Detrick or Kate?

1389
01:12:05,705 --> 01:12:06,870
What's going on?

1390
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:08,671
- I think you were set up.
- What?

1391
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:10,106
How do you know?
By who?

1392
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:11,940
- Had to be Detrick.
Kate figured it out.

1393
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:13,608
Now I can't find
either one of them.

1394
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,843
She was just outside.

1395
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:16,943
Hey, hey, hey!

1396
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:18,144
Can we get a statement?

1397
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:19,811
- Gone.
Okay.

1398
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:21,946
Put out an apb on Kate's car.
- Okay.

1399
01:12:21,948 --> 01:12:23,381
And find me
where Detrick lives.

1400
01:12:23,751 --> 01:12:25,049
You got it.

1401
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:36,922
I know you're awake, Kate.

1402
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:43,593
No sense in keeping
any secrets between us now.

1403
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:47,795
Good job, by the way.

1404
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:50,430
I was beginning to wonder
if anybody would figure it out.

1405
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:58,969
Where are we?

1406
01:13:00,972 --> 01:13:01,971
Home.

1407
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:10,777
Kate?

1408
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:14,945
Kate!

1409
01:13:37,794 --> 01:13:40,027
Kate?

1410
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:46,064
So this is where you grew up?

1411
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:47,899
Yup.

1412
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:49,534
Cozy, isn't it?

1413
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:02,809
Something happen to you here?

1414
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:05,910
Plenty happened here.

1415
01:14:05,912 --> 01:14:09,012
And I screamed and screamed,
but nobody ever came.

1416
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:14,549
You think that's why I kill people?

1417
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:18,185
I don't know why you kill people.

1418
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:21,120
Well...

1419
01:14:22,822 --> 01:14:24,054
It keeps the heart beating,

1420
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:25,722
I'll tell you that.

1421
01:14:28,926 --> 01:14:30,826
It keeps the blood flowing.

1422
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:35,495
Mm.

1423
01:14:39,932 --> 01:14:40,932
Damn it.

1424
01:14:47,038 --> 01:14:48,536
Nichols?

1425
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:50,604
Yeah.

1426
01:14:50,606 --> 01:14:52,538
- Does Detrick
own anything else?

1427
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,475
Apartment, farmland, anything.

1428
01:14:56,477 --> 01:14:59,610
Wasn't T.J. Working on a list
of abandoned properties?

1429
01:14:59,612 --> 01:15:01,478
- Yeah-Mona,
abandoned properties.

1430
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,679
I need that list now.

1431
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:06,047
T.J.
- Right here.

1432
01:15:06,049 --> 01:15:07,982
Still printing.

1433
01:15:07,984 --> 01:15:09,816
- Uh, looks like
35 new ones here.

1434
01:15:09,818 --> 01:15:10,983
Oh, man.

1435
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:12,685
What's wrong?

1436
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:14,085
- We got, like,
35 properties here.

1437
01:15:14,087 --> 01:15:17,120
She's still printing.

1438
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:18,855
- We're gonna have to get
as many people

1439
01:15:18,857 --> 01:15:19,922
Look for them as possible.

1440
01:15:19,924 --> 01:15:22,724
And...

1441
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,158
Hold on.

1442
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:27,093
Where's skid?

1443
01:15:27,095 --> 01:15:28,561
- Hey, skid.
- Yeah?

1444
01:15:28,563 --> 01:15:30,162
Yeah, he's here.

1445
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:32,864
- Didn't you tell me
Detrick grew up here?

1446
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:34,264
- Yup.
- Where?

1447
01:15:34,266 --> 01:15:36,132
Nothing-
nothing here owned by Detrick.

1448
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:37,900
- Yeah, he was raised
by his grandparents.

1449
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:40,568
- Mother's or father's side?
- Mother's.

1450
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,003
- Where-what's their name?
- They're dead now.

1451
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:46,138
That whole property's been
abandoned for years.

1452
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,239
Tomasetti.

1453
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:48,640
One more thing:

1454
01:15:48,642 --> 01:15:49,940
Is there a town alarm?

1455
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,509
There's the firehall siren,

1456
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:52,909
Just that and the church bells.

1457
01:15:55,578 --> 01:15:58,646
- Call them all.
Get everyone on it.

1458
01:15:58,648 --> 01:16:00,213
- Amish too?
- Of course. Everybody.

1459
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:02,115
- 'cause they have bells.
- Well, great. Get 'em ringing.

1460
01:16:11,722 --> 01:16:14,022
Why the roman numerals?

1461
01:16:14,024 --> 01:16:15,090
Why not?

1462
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:20,126
- You left ohio in '95.
Why was that?

1463
01:16:21,294 --> 01:16:24,095
I had a close call.

1464
01:16:24,097 --> 01:16:25,796
Figured it was just
a matter of time

1465
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:27,597
Before I got caught.

1466
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:35,068
So why Mona?

1467
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:39,105
Wanted a little more space
to work.

1468
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:42,106
Right, your work.

1469
01:16:42,108 --> 01:16:46,175
Girls six through ten, right?

1470
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:57,149
Why'd you come back?

1471
01:16:57,151 --> 01:16:59,717
Look who's full of questions.

1472
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,554
Stalling for time?

1473
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:06,688
Huh?

1474
01:17:13,827 --> 01:17:17,194
Who knows why I came back?

1475
01:17:17,196 --> 01:17:19,996
You know, that's the mistake
you people make,

1476
01:17:19,998 --> 01:17:24,165
Trying to put some sort of shape
on all of this,

1477
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:27,901
Trying to make sense
out of it,

1478
01:17:27,903 --> 01:17:30,636
Trying to find a meaning.

1479
01:17:30,638 --> 01:17:33,238
You know...

1480
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,140
What about just some girl
in a green dress

1481
01:17:37,142 --> 01:17:39,174
or a girl in a pair of jeans

1482
01:17:39,176 --> 01:17:42,143
Who walks across the street
and comes into view?

1483
01:17:43,947 --> 01:17:46,313
It's random,

1484
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:47,279
100%.

1485
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:49,914
Sometimes...

1486
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:54,684
You just got to roll the dice.

1487
01:17:57,188 --> 01:17:59,920
It doesn't have to make sense.

1488
01:18:08,962 --> 01:18:10,660
Any last questions, chief?

1489
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:14,163
You don't have to do this, Nate.

1490
01:18:14,165 --> 01:18:15,697
You're gonna get caught.

1491
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:17,599
You don't think they'd
figure this out by now?

1492
01:18:19,168 --> 01:18:21,801
That's half the fun.

1493
01:18:21,803 --> 01:18:24,035
Wait till they see
what I leave for 'em.

1494
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:29,806
What the hell is that?

1495
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:32,040
Kate!

1496
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:34,375
They're coming for you, Nate.

1497
01:18:44,148 --> 01:18:45,949
Kate!

1498
01:18:48,853 --> 01:18:49,922
Kate?

1499
01:18:51,548 --> 01:18:52,873
Kate?

1500
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:54,388
- John!
- Kate.

1501
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,822
He's got a gun.

1502
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,194
Kate!

1503
01:19:04,196 --> 01:19:06,195
He's going out the back.

1504
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:08,096
- Kate!
- Are you hit?

1505
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,032
I think maybe, yeah.

1506
01:19:12,034 --> 01:19:14,066
Oh.

1507
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:18,902
- John, no.
No, not now. Come here.

1508
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:23,205
Come here, John.

1509
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:24,239
Come help me.

1510
01:19:24,241 --> 01:19:25,641
Untie me.
Okay.

1511
01:19:25,643 --> 01:19:26,874
We're not gonna die in here.

1512
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:29,242
- No.
- No.

1513
01:19:32,713 --> 01:19:34,746
Get me the hell out of here, John.

1514
01:19:34,748 --> 01:19:37,214
I was gonna say
the same thing.

1515
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:21,408
Somewhere around here.

1516
01:20:24,077 --> 01:20:25,244
I'm gonna take a look down here.

1517
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,758
You're surrounded, Nate.

1518
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,427
It's no use.

1519
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,469
Well, what are you doing?

1520
01:21:10,205 --> 01:21:11,272
Detrick, freeze.

1521
01:21:13,908 --> 01:21:15,240
Shoot him, you're dead.

1522
01:21:24,114 --> 01:21:26,881
It's finished now.

1523
01:21:52,865 --> 01:21:54,765
Get out of here.

1524
01:22:02,772 --> 01:22:03,804
Oh.

1525
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,811
Hey, chief?
- Yeah?

1526
01:22:15,813 --> 01:22:17,079
I just got a complaint

1527
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:21,014
about a loose cow
at Stutz's farm again.

1528
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:23,015
Send T.J.?

1529
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:25,317
No.

1530
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:27,085
That's okay.
I'll go.

1531
01:22:27,087 --> 01:22:28,819
- Okay.
- Mona?

1532
01:22:28,821 --> 01:22:31,221
Chief?

1533
01:22:31,223 --> 01:22:33,055
I think we'll cite him this time.

1534
01:22:34,358 --> 01:22:36,157
Copy.

1535
01:22:40,261 --> 01:22:43,062
- So I'm heading back
to columbus tonight.

1536
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:45,897
And I thought
maybe I could have

1537
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:48,931
Dinner with the chief
before I go.

1538
01:22:53,903 --> 01:22:56,003
All right.

1539
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:58,371
Okay.

1540
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:02,106
# Home is anywhere

1541
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:05,342
# You are with me tonight

1542
01:23:05,918 --> 01:23:08,309
# The streets are cold

1543
01:23:12,815 --> 01:23:16,182
# And the distances
will disappear #

1544
01:23:16,184 --> 01:23:18,517
# With miles to go

1545
01:23:18,519 --> 01:23:22,852
# The evening

1546
01:23:26,557 --> 01:23:28,523
# And I saw, saw

1547
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:33,793
# A flicker of light below

1548
01:23:33,795 --> 01:23:36,194
# Oh, oh

1549
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:43,532
# Can only roam so far

1550
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:47,168
# Before you find yourself

1551
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:51,837
# Running home
