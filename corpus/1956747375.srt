1
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,407
- Race?
- Sure.

2
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,240
Up and back.

3
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:24,990
- Steroids.
- Yeah, right.

4
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,490
Mike Chatham, third year.

5
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:49,740
- I can't seem to find your name.
- You can't find it?

6
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,990
Guess I'll have to give up being a doctor
and take you out to breakfast instead.

7
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,073
Save the bedside manner
for someone else.

8
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,699
Chatham, group eight.
OB-GYN.

9
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,198
- How about a rain check on breakfast?
- Lucky me.

10
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,532
Never rains in California.

11
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:07,699
MAN:
Chatham!

12
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:09,824
- Hayes!
- What are you?

13
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,907
- Eight. What are you?
- The same.

14
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,800
- All right. Great.
- Yeah, great for you. I can kiss Honors good-bye

15
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,323
with you in my group.

16
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,031
Hello, Michael.

17
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,865
- Julie.
- Unbelievable!

18
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,782
- You and Julie?
- Not anymore. How was love in Denver?

19
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:25,365
There's this lab assistant. She's,
like, naked under her coat.

20
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,198
- No, she works like that?
- Every day.

21
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,925
Try to keep your beaker
steady with that in the room.

22
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,573
Hayes, you tell that story
to one more person...

23
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:33,073
- Suzanne.
- Hey, Michael.

24
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,925
Hey. Tell me it's not too
late to quit med school

25
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,532
and come away to Paris with me.

26
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,615
It is,
Michael. I already paid for this year.

27
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,073
Children.

28
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:42,615
Out of the 98 available
male third-year students,

29
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,615
how come I get the one guy that
I've roomed with for five years?

30
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,907
- What did I do to deserve this?
- You? What about me?

31
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,240
- Group eight?
- Verily.

32
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:52,448
- Hey, Hayes. How's it goin'?
- Great.

33
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,031
- Suzanne. Chatham. You're in this group, huh?
- Hi, Kenny.

34
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:59,240
That's good.
That's good.

35
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,573
Two surgeons. Great. Maybe I
can skip surgery rotation altogether.

36
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:05,281
- Nobody'll know I'm missing.
- SUZANNE: Yeah.

37
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,132
Hayes passed out last Thanksgiving
when I asked him to carve the turkey.

38
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:10,323
Completely untrue.
Absolute slander.

39
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,699
- Gina. Hey.
- Hey!

40
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:21,115
- Hi, Gina.
- Michael.

41
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:23,115
Kenny. How's Lauren?

42
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,740
Don't faint.
We got hitched this summer.

43
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:28,073
You were the one who always
said marriage made you soft.

44
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:32,198
Yeah, well, it turns out
it makes you sharper.

45
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:37,407
- Hey, Mike. Guys.
- It's Gant.

46
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,490
You can always tell
it's the first day of the year.

47
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:42,949
- Gant's nose isn't brown yet.
- What you guys got?

48
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,949
- OB-GYN.
- Ah.

49
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,323
Save my seat there, partner.
Thanks.

50
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,448
I got Redding first.
Surgery.

51
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,782
- KENNY: Lucky you.
- That's easy for you to say.

52
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:56,198
Redding is a killer. He's the dean of
third year. He's gonna bust my balls.

53
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,490
Mike, uh, what say we share
notes again this year, huh?

54
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,448
(scoffs)
You take mine, you mean?

55
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:05,323
(laughs)
Michael! Suzanne.

56
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,699
- Beautiful.
- Forget it, Gant.

57
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:11,198
(bell ringing)

58
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:14,407
- Here you go, partner.
- Thanks.

59
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:29,657
I'm Dr. David Redding, dean of
third-year studies and Chief of Surgery.

60
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,490
You know, every year I look
out at the group assembled here,

61
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,657
and I ask myself
the same question:

62
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,490
why would anyone knowingly
do this to themselves?

63
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:41,990
For the next year,
your days will not end.

64
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,323
The work will never stop.

65
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:48,031
Your rank will command
absolutely zero respect.

66
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,073
And, worst of all,
after it's over,

67
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,824
you will be faced with
the horrible realization

68
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,699
that there is nothing
in your medical career

69
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:58,365
that will ever be as rewarding
as third year.

70
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,740
Third year is like
being an 18-year-old rookie

71
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:03,699
and being called on to pitch the
seventh game of the world series...

72
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,532
blindfolded.

73
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,782
- (students chuckling)
- Doesn't get any tougher.

74
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:11,031
Just remember though that
none of you would be here

75
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:13,198
if you weren't pretty good
rookies to start with.

76
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:16,615
Now, for survival purposes,
you have been divided into small groups

77
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,740
that you will stay with all year
through each of your rotations.

78
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:22,198
The very best in each specialty

79
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,949
will be selected to enter
residency in that area.

80
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,782
There are three internships
in Pediatrics,

81
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,573
two for OB-GYN,
two for Internal Medicine,

82
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,865
and one and only one
for Surgery.

83
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,740
That's my little
neck of the woods.

84
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:40,240
Your future will depend on how
many honor grades you accumulate

85
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:43,407
during the course of the year and
whether or not you honor in your specialty.

86
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,532
- Size.
- I know that's very important to you.

87
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,532
For me, the only thing
that really matters

88
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,990
is making you into
the best doctors possible.

89
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:54,156
Because it is hands-on from this moment on,
people, for the rest of your professional days.

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,782
Well, doesn't everybody
look official?

91
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:59,615
I'm Bobby. I'm Dr. Redding's
physician's aide.

92
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,782
It's my job to show you people
how little you really know.

93
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,615
And... I love my job.

94
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,341
Every morning, you will be at the
hospital an hour before the doctors

95
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:10,573
to check on your patients'
primary care.

96
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:13,615
Then the entire team with your
resident will make the rounds.

97
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,323
- During these sessions, you will be pimped.
- Pimped?

98
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:20,407
Pimped... questioned,
probed and humiliated by the residents...

99
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,240
for interpretations,
diagnoses, complications.

100
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:27,407
Cases that are really juicy will
be reviewed in grand rounds,

101
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,031
which is the same as regular rounds except
that everybody in the house is there.

102
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:34,657
If you intend to make Honors, you'd
better know your shit on grand rounds.

103
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,824
I've been in this place
a long time,

104
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,383
and I've never seen anyone
screw up grand rounds

105
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:40,865
and come out
with Honors. Nobody.

106
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,829
Daily summaries are on green paper,
permanent summaries are on red paper.

107
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:46,615
Please observe the following
demonstration closely.

108
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,615
Unlabeled blood specimens received
in the specimen receiving room...

109
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,407
will be processed as follows.

110
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,990
Nurses... heads, R.N.s,
L.V.N.s, nurse's aides...

111
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:01,490
It is easy to confuse them.
Don't.

112
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,490
- (Bobby continues, indistinct)
- Hi.

113
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:05,990
- Hi.
- Talking's allowed.

114
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:08,031
I'm glad you're enjoying
the privilege.

115
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,383
Seeing as how we didn't do
too much of it our first two years,

116
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,716
I thought now that we're in the same group,
we could make up for lost time.

117
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,573
Michael, you've convinced me.
You're very charming.

118
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,323
- Thank you.
- But I'm afraid you've got it.

119
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,907
- Got what?
- Surgeon's ego.

120
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,532
- What is it? A disease? What?
- You look to be a classic case.

121
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:26,323
- Your personality already fits the prototype.
- And what's that?

122
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:29,865
As a group, they're narcissistic,
insensitive, chauvinistic,

123
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,198
and their only definition of
success is to win at all costs.

124
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:37,407
- (grunts) - I'm Dr. Margaret Kennan,
chief resident of OB-GYN.

125
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,031
You will begin the first of
your rotations in my domain.

126
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:47,156
The patient is a 23-year-old gravida 1,
para 0, ab-0, 40 weeks gestation,

127
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,490
noted one week ago to have
frank breech presentation.

128
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,532
External versions
attempted two times failed,

129
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,073
so she's been admitted
for elective C-section.

130
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:56,865
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:00,240
- Buenos días, señora.
- Ola.

132
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:03,573
Dr. Hayes, why is this patient
having a C-section?

133
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,699
Uh, well...

134
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,949
If she were well, Dr. Hayes,
she wouldn't be here.

135
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:11,240
Dr. Wyler?

136
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:13,615
Because the
external version failed.

137
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,424
Delivering a breech presentation might
expose the baby to unnecessary injury.

138
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,699
And what injuries are those?
Dr. Rose?

139
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:22,740
Uh, nerve damage, prolapsed
cord and delay in delivery of the head.

140
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:26,073
What about the possible problems
with doing a C-section? Dr. Chatham?

141
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:30,281
Aspiration from anesthesia, bleeding,
infection, pulmonary embolism.

142
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,240
- Good.
- (woman groans)

143
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,657
- I knew that.
- MAN: Some help here!

144
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,448
Dr. Kennan! Seventh baby.
Got hung up in Admitting.

145
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:39,573
- She's not gonna make it to delivery.
- Okay.

146
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:41,657
- (grunting)
- Get over here!

147
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,281
Hold her up for me. I want you to
breathe. Just breathe. Now, push.

148
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:49,156
- (screaming)
- Push! Big push. Big push.

149
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,573
- (grunting)
- Yeah! Don't stop.

150
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,740
Breathe in.
Breathe in.

151
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:55,573
Here it comes.
Big push.

152
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:57,740
Hey! Yeah! Yeah!

153
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:59,907
KENNAN:
Good girl. Relax.

154
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,073
- You have a beautiful, perfect, little baby boy.
- (baby crying)

155
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,323
(crying continues)

156
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,323
Oh, wow!

157
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:16,031
- (sighs) A baby.
- You're here, people.

158
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,615
Is it too late for law school?

159
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,198
All right. Kenny's patient,
Mrs. Thompkins.

160
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:25,198
Twenty-three weeks
gestation noted. Hayes?

161
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:29,490
- Top left.
- Is admitted for strong labor pains.

162
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,615
- (gasps, coughs)
- Don't!

163
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,448
Hayes!

164
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,782
Be careful not to touch
anything. It's a lab experiment.

165
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:38,782
That you've been growing
for two years. Use mine, Gina.

166
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:42,615
So, now, what if
the ultrasound shows abruption?

167
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,615
Then the bleeding
will probably stop.

168
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:47,365
SUZANNE: Okay. But what happens
when she begins contractions?

169
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,281
Uh, do an amnio on her.

170
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,615
Determine the baby's age
in case she needs a section.

171
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,115
There's no need to do
a tap on her this soon.

172
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:56,841
Why don't you just try to stop labor and
see if you can carry her for a few weeks?

173
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,490
- No way. You're wrong.
- No, I'm right.

174
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:01,549
If it was an abruption,
the odds are that the bleeding will stop.

175
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,758
And if you can stop her labor,
she'll probably go to term.

176
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:06,782
I mean, there's no need
to risk a tap right away.

177
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,073
You're right.

178
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,657
- What are you drinking?
- Herbal tea. It's from Pakistan.

179
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,990
You can probably
smell it in Pakistan.

180
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:23,740
- (chuckles) - SUZANNE:
It doesn't bother Hayes.

181
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:27,699
Yeah, my olfactory cells were destroyed
when we first started rooming together.

182
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:31,407
What do you guys do when, you know,
one of you brings home a date?

183
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,323
What's a date?

184
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,740
In med school? When was the
last time I had a date, Hayes?

185
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,156
I believe the year was 1922.

186
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,407
-Woody Wilson had just taken office,
and... -(knocking)

187
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,865
Come on in.
It's open.

188
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:50,115
- Hi.
- Lauren. I thought I was gonna call you.

189
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:51,949
I thought you were too.

190
00:11:57,448 --> 00:12:00,949
Everybody, this is my wife.

191
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:05,365
-Lauren. Um, you know Gina. -Hi.

192
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,782
- Hi.
- This is Michael.

193
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:09,031
- Hi.
- And Suzanne.

194
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:11,073
- Hi.
- And Hayes.

195
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:14,198
- How do?
- Hey.

196
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:17,073
- You didn't change.
- No, I just got off work.

197
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,782
What... Oh, Jesus.
Look what time it is.

198
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:23,740
- Where do you work?
- Uh, she works in a restaurant.

199
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:26,573
If you want, I can come back
over when you're done.

200
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,448
No way. You kidding?
We're out of here.

201
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,615
- Um, in the morning.
- Bye.

202
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:36,281
Well, I think I'll be going too.

203
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,281
Bye, you guys.
Nice meeting you. Bye.

204
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:43,156
Bye, Gina.

205
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,448
So, how was
your first day at school?

206
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,573
Did you play nice
with the other kids?

207
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:52,240
I figure there's five guys seriously
in contention for the internship.

208
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:56,907
Chatham's the one. The other
guys I'm not so worried about.

209
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,740
Kenny, I've known you
since you were 12.

210
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,031
You've gotten everything you've wanted,
including me.

211
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,865
Well, you were easy.

212
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,782
How's the restaurant biz?

213
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:16,573
Let me put it this way. Get your M.D. fast,
and get me out of there!

214
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:22,198
(honking horn)

215
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,949
- Hi.
- Hi.

216
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:36,156
Need a ride?

217
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,448
No, somebody's gonna pick me up.

218
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:41,448
(sighs) It's late. Why don't
you come in and wait with me?

219
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,782
My house is right there.

220
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,824
Michael, I was raised on a military
base. I know how to take care of myself.

221
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:51,490
This place is a little more like the front
lines at night, if you know what I mean.

222
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,573
I'll just wait out here
with you.

223
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:56,031
That's a very nice gesture,
and I appreciate it,

224
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,490
but, thanks, no.

225
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,907
Okay.

226
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,031
- Good night.
- Good night.

227
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,532
Look, I'm sorry.
I won't stay out here.

228
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:26,865
Just do me a favor, will ya?
Hold on to this for protection.

229
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,865
I don't need this, Michael.

230
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:31,365
Oh, no, it's not for you.
It's for me.

231
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:35,782
You think anybody's gonna attack my house with
you standing in the street holding this thing?

232
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,532
That was nice of you to come
out. Thank you for waiting with me.

233
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:40,657
- (vehicle approaching)
- It's...

234
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:47,073
Hey. Batting practice?

235
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,907
See you later.

236
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:54,240
(woman speaking over P.A.)

237
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:13,907
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dr. Rose.

238
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,824
MICHAEL: So were you able
to sleep through the night?

239
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:23,448
- Mm-hmm.
- Great. Your blood pressure looks good.

240
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:27,490
We'll do an ultrasound next Tuesday.
You seem to be doing pretty well.

241
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,740
- Gina.
- (sighs) I'm late.

242
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:35,031
- Hi.
- Hi.

243
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:38,407
- Late night?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,031
Gina, who is this guy?

245
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:45,156
Hmm. His name
is Donald Ballentine.

246
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,448
He's Redding's surgery resident.

247
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,573
No kidding?

248
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:55,198
This may be none of my business,
but... is it serious?

249
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,573
- Would it matter to you if it was?
- No.

250
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:01,949
I didn't think so.

251
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,657
(women chuckling)

252
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,532
- Our first baby.
- It was incredible.

253
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,949
- I'm so proud.
- Oh.

254
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,615
(chuckling continues)

255
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:23,073
After what we just saw in there,
I'm not so sure I want children.

256
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:25,365
- I do, definitely.
- A little Dr. Ballentine?

257
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,699
Oh! On second thought.

258
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:31,615
Sometimes, he's great. He takes this
surgeon-messiah thing a little too far.

259
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,939
I mean, the sex is good,
but I don't think it's worth it.

260
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,240
No. It's worth it. Trust one
who hasn't had it in a while.

261
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,407
- What, nothing?
- Well, who has time to meet anybody with this job?

262
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,532
- Single guy alert.
- GANT: Ladies.

263
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:45,532
Blue is definitely your color.

264
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,907
I need a man, not sleaze.

265
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,532
- What about Hayes?
- Oh! Hayes?

266
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,240
Hayes is like my brother. It
would be like committing a-a crime.

267
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:57,615
But I always thought
you'd be great together.

268
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,659
- Well, we are as roommates. Anyway, he's not my type.
- What is your type?

269
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,407
Well, you know. The kind of guy you meet,
sleep with immediately,

270
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,841
carry on a horrible relationship
with for two or three months

271
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,448
while they make you feel
really shitty about yourself,

272
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,657
then break up with
and never speak to again.

273
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,240
- I know that type.
- Yeah. Bye.

274
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,657
Bye.

275
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,740
- Dr. Chatham.
- Rose.

276
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,699
Thanks, Larry.

277
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,198
You shootin' for
the surgery internship?

278
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,532
Thinkin' about it.
You?

279
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,323
Thinking about it.

280
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,240
I guess we're both
thinking about it.

281
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:46,657
- You know the guy?
- Redding? No. Never met him.

282
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,281
Thought you would have,
your father bein' a surgeon and all.

283
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:53,281
What, because my father should know him,
I-I would know him?

284
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,198
Yeah. Ain't that
the way it goes?

285
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:59,031
LARRY:
Chatham? Order's up.

286
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Thanks, Larry.

287
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,161
- (woman panting) -
MICHAEL: Breathe. That's it.

288
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,824
Come on, now.
Breathe. Breathe.

289
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:14,031
- How long has it been?
- Sixteen hours.

290
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:17,115
Sixteen hours?
Prepare for a C-section.

291
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,490
- WOMAN: No!
- Sir, can't we give it a little longer?

292
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,549
It could take five more hours
for that baby to come down,

293
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:23,053
and I've got 10 more
like her waiting.

294
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,323
- Prepare for a "C."
- I'll wait with her.

295
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,740
How many of these have you done?

296
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:31,490
Including this one?
One.

297
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,573
- Your first.
- Yeah.

298
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:36,865
Only a third-year
would offer to do this.

299
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:38,699
So, wait with her.

300
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,156
(sighs)
Great. Thank you.

301
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,156
Thank you.

302
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,407
- (panting continues)
- Breathe.

303
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:49,323
- Hey!
- Hey.

304
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:52,824
- Sorry I'm late.
- I never thought we'd have a date in the lobby of a hospital.

305
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:55,031
We had this amazing
triple aneurysm.

306
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:57,216
We tried to lock him off above the knee,
but we couldn't get it.

307
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,031
So we had to go in
through the other side.

308
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,782
It was amazing.
It's... It's hard to explain.

309
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,573
I delivered my first baby today.

310
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,699
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:10,532
That's-that's-that's great.
It must be exciting, huh?

312
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,865
It was a little scary,
to tell you the truth.

313
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:15,257
You'll get used to it. You'll
be able to do it in your sleep.

314
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:19,198
God, I remember OB-GYN,
and I thought it was tough.

315
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:21,323
Now it's like
a walk in the park.

316
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,740
It didn't seem like
a walk in the park to me.

317
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,949
No, you'll get used to it.
I promise.

318
00:20:29,323 --> 00:20:31,615
I gotta get back up there.

319
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:37,865
This was great. It's the
cheapest date we ever had.

320
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:41,615
(man speaking over P.A.)

321
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,740
Doctor.

322
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,615
Give me Miss Wilson's chart
in 1217, please.

323
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,615
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,073
- Gina.
- Hi.

325
00:20:51,156 --> 00:20:54,156
Hi.
How'd it go today?

326
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:57,115
Good. Really good.

327
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:59,573
(sighs) How's Rita?
Did she ever deliver?

328
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:02,949
Yeah. A boy... for 23 hours,
14 minutes and 10 seconds.

329
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,073
Voom!
She's out like a light.

330
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,115
- And I'm a wreck.
- (chuckles)

331
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,508
when I was a little girl, I used to
always dream about becoming a doctor...

332
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,573
and doing something
like delivering a baby.

333
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,657
Now you're here doin' it.

334
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,657
- Yeah.
- It's kind of incredible, isn't it?

335
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,949
Congratulations on your first delivery,
Dr. Wyler.

336
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:27,031
Thank you.
You too.

337
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:30,323
Thanks. See ya.

338
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:32,365
See ya.

339
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:37,156
KENNY:
Lauren, hey.

340
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,365
Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't call.

341
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,490
I couldn't find any time.

342
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:46,490
Hey.
Hey, say something.

343
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:50,198
Come on. I can't stand it
when you don't say anything.

344
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,490
I've been in
a four-hour delivery.

345
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:55,049
I couldn't get a break to take a piss,
much less give you a call.

346
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:59,365
I'm sorry.
Me too.

347
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,490
(sighs)
How was your day?

348
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,073
WOMAN OVER P.A.: Paging Dr. Rose,
Dr. Kenneth Rose.

349
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,323
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's good.

350
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:10,407
Mm-hmm. Look...

351
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,949
Look, I gotta go. Yeah,
I know. I'll call, I promise.

352
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:19,990
I... promise.

353
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,865
(chuckles)
Yeah.

354
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:25,115
Yeah, bye.

355
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:33,490
A gift from Redding, people.

356
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:37,740
A list of 30 emergency
drugs. Know them by Friday.

357
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,865
- When's Friday?
- In about eight hours.

358
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,490
Maybe you'll absorb it
by osmosis.

359
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,365
- Who's up?
- I am.

360
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:51,990
- Me too.
- E.R., stat.

361
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,198
- Where's the stomach puncture?
- This one here.

362
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:58,699
Prep. Come on, you two.
Come on over here and help me.

363
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:01,031
Dr. Rose, start an I.V.
and hang a unit of plasma.

364
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:04,323
Dr. Chapman,
I need four red tops.

365
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:08,448
Damn. What did they use
on this guy, a machete?

366
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,462
Chatham, how do we know if we
need to send this patient to the O.R.?

367
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,949
- Peritoneal lavage, sir.
- That's right.

368
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,198
Okay, let's set up
a peritoneal lavage.

369
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,365
Can I have the otoscope, please?

370
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:23,407
So, Rose, I understand
you're from Chicago.

371
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,740
Yes, sir.
My folks still live there.

372
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:27,699
What am I looking for here,
Rose?

373
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,740
- Blood behind the eardrum. Possible skull fracture.
- Right.

374
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:36,323
Can we drape him, please? Rose,
I need you to infiltrate with Xylocaine.

375
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:39,907
What do they do... your folks?

376
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,490
My father's in the
restaurant supply business.

377
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,865
Scalpel.

378
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:51,615
- Chatham, make a small incision there.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:56,073
Retractor. Rose, hold this retractor,
please. Keep your eyes on it.

380
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:57,883
So why didn't you get
into the family business?

381
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:59,824
I always wanted
to be a doctor, sir.

382
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:04,115
Yeah.

383
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:06,824
Feed this tube in here, Chatham.

384
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:11,156
So what about you, Chatham? You
wanna be a doctor like your old man?

385
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,257
Sir, when I was six, I actually thought
about becoming one of The Temptations.

386
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:17,281
Oh. Really?
You didn't pursue it, then?

387
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:19,990
No, sir.
The position's filled.

388
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,448
Keep your eyes
on this tube, please.

389
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,782
- ROSE: What made you decide to become a doctor?
- Helplessness, I guess.

390
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:32,865
I'd been marching with
some farm workers in Florida.

391
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,281
I'd been talking to this guy.

392
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:38,782
All of a sudden, he drops in
front of me with a heart attack.

393
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:40,841
There I was. I was trying
to save the ills of the world,

394
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,490
and I couldn't even save a guy
who was dying in front of me.

395
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,323
What do you got
in that tube there, Chatham?

396
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:52,907
Clear solution, sir, indicating
no internal bleeding in the patient.

397
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,573
Good. All right.
Let's stitch him up.

398
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:01,198
Gentlemen, you know,
I think you're both very promising doctors.

399
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,323
I want you
to remember something.

400
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:06,323
Who we are and where we come from,
it's really good for chitchat.

401
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:09,824
But in my program, the only thing
that really matters is how good you are.

402
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,407
All right.
Finish up here.

403
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:24,281
Chatham.

404
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,615
Kenny! Hi.

405
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:48,365
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

406
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:51,031
Chatham got the Honors
in OB-GYN.

407
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:54,573
Oh, sweetie. Well,
why didn't you come inside?

408
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:56,907
How long have you been out here?

409
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,573
- I don't know.
- Come on.

410
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:03,865
You'll make Honors
next rotation.

411
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:06,031
Okay?

412
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:09,073
I can't let this guy beat me.

413
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:13,865
- Not now. I've come too far.
- (chattering)

414
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,198
- Good night, Lauren.
- Good night.

415
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,949
George, Nell. I want you to meet Kenny,
my husband.

416
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:24,573
These are the people I was tellin' you about
that make this place bearable every night.

417
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:27,490
Oh, you're the reason Lauren
has to work in this joint, huh?

418
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:30,615
- You got a girl with a heart of gold.
- Lucky guy.

419
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,699
- Ow!
- Come on. Good night.

420
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,824
Kenny?

421
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:38,031
It's no big deal.

422
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,615
Yeah.

423
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,115
I gotta go home.

424
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:46,323
I gotta study.

425
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:52,073
A full day off. I can think of
about a million things I wanna do.

426
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:54,782
- What do you think of?
- Women.

427
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,657
Really?
That's fascinating.

428
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,323
"Really? That's fascinating."
What? You asked me, I told you.

429
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:04,490
Will you go get my tofu?

430
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:07,490
Tofu? No, I don't want...
That stuff looks like-like...

431
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:09,740
Like tofu.
Go get it.

432
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:19,782
(woman laughing)

433
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:23,365
HAYES: Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen. I'll be back in a few minutes.

434
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:26,323
(chuckles) So I'm all ready to
do an open-heart on this guy.

435
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:29,615
And then I look at his chart, and
he's here to get a cleaning and flossing.

436
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:32,532
I don't know. I tell ya,
I can't get no respect.

437
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:35,740
Guy walks into a doctor's office. The
doctor says, "I've got some bad news..."

438
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:40,031
- MAN: How are ya?
- Good.

439
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,031
- How are you?
- Real good. Nice to see you.

440
00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:44,907
- You too.
- Well, everything's set.

441
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,883
We've agreed to renew
the same student loan option

442
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:48,865
that you've had
for the last two years.

443
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:50,365
Full tuition.

444
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:55,657
So if you'll just sign
right there and there.

445
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,198
Sure.

446
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:00,865
May I ask you a personal question,
Mr. Chatham?

447
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:03,365
I know your father's a doctor.

448
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:07,323
These loans are gonna weigh on you
for a good 10, 15 years of your career.

449
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,532
Why don't I just get my dad
to pay for it?

450
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:12,824
We don't have
that kind of relationship.

451
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:15,990
It doesn't work that way.

452
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:18,490
There's something about
a hospital serving liver.

453
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:22,240
Suzanne, baby, I am desperate. I
need your notes on OB "D" and "C."

454
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:24,604
"Kennan"? Gant,
you're picking up your resident's laundry?

455
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:27,758
- Well, she asked me for a favor. She's a little busy.
- HAYES: "Please, Dr. Kennan.

456
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:30,573
Oh, God, please let me do you
a favor and pick up your laundry!"

457
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,740
Come on,
guys. Give me a break. I'm not that bad.

458
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:35,464
- Give me a chili dog, will you?
- Excuse us, ladies and gentlemen.

459
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,615
Dr. Gant, you got
anything in there for me?

460
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:40,341
Uh, no, sir. But if you'd like me to
pick anything up or go get anything...

461
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:42,448
No, no.
I'm... I'm just kidding.

462
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:44,740
All right, George,
don't shit me now.

463
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,007
Is this liver on the up and up here,
or do I go for the regular?

464
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:49,740
Happy Thanksgiving.

465
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:51,865
- Dr. Chatham?
- Yes, sir?

466
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,073
Henrietta Walker.
Interesting case, huh?

467
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:56,907
Yes, sir.
Cancer patient.

468
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,407
I'm gonna put her
on grand rounds for Monday.

469
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:12,573
Hello, Mrs. Walker. I'm Dr. Michael
Chatham, your student doctor.

470
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:15,949
Just wanted to come introduce myself.
I've had some blood work ordered.

471
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,132
A nurse will come up here
shortly and take some samples.

472
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,740
It might hurt for a moment,
but it'll go away.

473
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:25,990
I see you're a... an elementary
school teacher. What grade?

474
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:29,073
Mr. Chatham,

475
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:31,949
I realize this is
a teaching hospital.

476
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:36,657
But since I do not want you
practicing dramatics at my bedside,

477
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,573
please drop this transparent act

478
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:42,073
of the concerned doctor.

479
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,949
You will find this infinitely
easier on both of us...

480
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:50,115
if you'll concentrate on being direct,
accurate and to the point.

481
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:52,699
I know what I have,
and I know why I'm here.

482
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:57,073
I don't need hand-holding.
Is that understood?

483
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:01,865
Yes. Yes.

484
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,657
(clicking tongue)
Drink.

485
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,990
Hayes.
Thanks, buddy.

486
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,407
Listen, why don't you take a break in
about an hour? We'll grab some dinner.

487
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,925
You gotta eat, or you're gonna be
worthless for grand rounds tomorrow.

488
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:31,573
I can't, man. I gotta check
on Miss Walker in an hour.

489
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:34,990
- I'll get something later.
- Yeah, that's what I thought you'd say.

490
00:30:35,073 --> 00:30:38,323
So, from Suzanne.

491
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,990
- Tell her I said thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

492
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,115
Uh, Gina's contribution.

493
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:48,073
I think you're makin'
real headway with that girl.

494
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,865
- Get outta here.
- Uh-huh.

495
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,699
- Are you gonna eat that sandwich?
- Yeah.

496
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:02,407
- Just checking.
- Right.

497
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,490
(chattering)

498
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,532
- Any time, Dr. Chatham.
- Yes, sir.

499
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:20,073
The patient, Miss Henrietta Walker,
is a 49-year-old female,

500
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:23,448
presents with sharp, epigastric pain,
nausea, although no vomiting.

501
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:26,615
- This has been increasing in the last three months.
- Physical findings?

502
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:28,699
Distended abdomen
with diffused tenderness,

503
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:31,615
shifting dullness,
and a fluid wave sign indicating ascites.

504
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:35,198
- What workup was done?
- CAT scan shows a mass in the area of the stomach.

505
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:38,240
Endoscopy and biopsy test
positive for gastric carcinoma.

506
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:40,365
Well, what's your assessment,
Dr. Chatham?

507
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,907
A large gastric carcinoma with
possible spread to the greater omentum.

508
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,240
All right. She's your patient.
How would you treat her?

509
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:49,281
- Give her several courses of chemotherapy.
- Mm-hmm. What else?

510
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,490
- Wait for significant improvement and attempt surgery.
- All right.

511
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:55,156
Let's take a look
at the patient.

512
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,740
- Henrietta.
- Dr. Redding.

513
00:31:57,824 --> 00:32:00,198
I have some friends
with me here.

514
00:32:04,532 --> 00:32:06,657
Let's take a look.

515
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,657
Tell me if I push too hard.

516
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,407
Don't worry.
I won't hesitate.

517
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,281
I'm sure you won't.

518
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:22,240
How are the cats?

519
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:24,615
Splendid.

520
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,615
Any new additions?

521
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,865
None since the Siamese.

522
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,198
(groans)

523
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:41,490
I've decided it's time
to put my house in order...

524
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,907
in case I don't come home
this time.

525
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,824
That's an admirable thought,

526
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:50,615
but one I think
you could put off...

527
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,365
for the immediate future.

528
00:32:55,448 --> 00:32:57,782
All right.

529
00:32:57,865 --> 00:33:01,657
Well, I think Dr. Chatham's
assessment's on the money.

530
00:33:03,573 --> 00:33:05,156
Questions?

531
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,865
KENNY:
I have a question, sir.

532
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:14,532
- Yes?
- Dr. Chatham,

533
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:17,740
what if there's intestinal
blockage secondary to metastasis?

534
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,865
Tests haven't revealed that.

535
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:25,490
What tests?

536
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:29,657
CAT scan, liver and bone scan,
L.F.T.s, SMA-12.

537
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,532
Those wouldn't necessarily
reveal intestinal obstruction...

538
00:33:32,615 --> 00:33:34,740
or possible pleural effusion,

539
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:38,031
which, from your presentation,
could be included in this assessment.

540
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:43,782
That's a good point,
Dr. Rose.

541
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:51,407
All right, let's order an upper
G.I. series for Mrs. Walker.

542
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,949
Thank you, Henrietta.
Doctors.

543
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,073
Are you all right?

544
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,865
I was expecting to be attacked,
but not by someone in my own group.

545
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:11,448
Well, Kenny's a fighter. He's
probably had to fight all of his life.

546
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:15,198
You know, it's funny. When
Kenny's a tough-ass competitor,

547
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:17,424
everybody says, "It's all right. It's
okay. Look where he's come from.

548
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:19,949
He's had it tough. So what
if he's an asshole about it?"

549
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:23,424
Gina, if I had pulled a stunt like he did
today in there, I'd have been crucified for it.

550
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:26,198
Why? Because your father's
a surgeon?

551
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:29,198
-Michael... -Look, it doesn't matter,
okay? It's not important.

552
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:33,365
All that matters are end results.
Who's the best. I don't like to lose.

553
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:37,657
Kenny may have fired the first shot,
but I'm gonna win this war.

554
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,657
Michael.

555
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,657
The tests suggested by Dr. Rose
have all been run on the patient.

556
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,100
All prove negative,
thus supporting my initial assessment...

557
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,073
that the patient,
Miss Henrietta Walker,

558
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,216
begin a prescribed chemotherapy
regime beginning in two weeks...

559
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,615
continuing for
six concurrent weeks.

560
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:01,490
Thank you, Dr. Chatham.
Good follow-up. Questions?

561
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:05,407
Finish up with your patient,
Dr. Chatham,

562
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,657
- and then meet up with us in rounds.
- Yes, sir.

563
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:15,907
Oh, well, I think...

564
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,323
that is what is referred to
as a hollow victory.

565
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:22,782
I'm sorry. I guess sometimes
we get carried away.

566
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:26,782
It's the competition.
It... I'm sorry.

567
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:30,824
No need to apologize.
It's entertaining.

568
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:34,198
You know, I could have gone
to a private hospital.

569
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:36,615
Pension and disability
are pretty generous

570
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,198
when you've been a teacher
for 25 years.

571
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,281
I chose to be here.

572
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:45,198
- Why?
- Because this is a teaching hospital.

573
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:49,782
And being a teacher,
I relate to the process going on around me.

574
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:52,865
It... It makes me feel less sick,

575
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,281
like I'm back in my classroom.

576
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:57,323
So how am I doing, Teach?

577
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:02,532
You're doing pretty well,
Dr. Chatham.

578
00:36:02,615 --> 00:36:06,532
Just don't concentrate
so much on the facts.

579
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,323
Facts are pretty important
around here.

580
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:11,407
So are people, Doctor.

581
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:32,407

Michael, Michael, Michael.
You let me down.

00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:49,198
Blowin' Honors this rotation.
Very embarrassing.

589
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:52,081
Listen, I think you should think
about going to another medical school.

590
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:55,115
- Perhaps, uh, Walla Walla.
- Got an address?

591
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,448
Next time, kimosabe.

592
00:36:58,532 --> 00:37:01,031
Suzanne.
You look great.

593
00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:04,949
- (laughs)
- Care to dance?

594
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:08,782
Look at Gant.
That snake.

595
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:18,073

That's it.

603
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,115
I'm gonna do something
about that guy.

604
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:55,407
So we go in through the fourth and fifth
ribs, and it looks like it's gonna be routine.

605
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,115
Then it turns out the guy has a
mediastinal mass obstructing the vena cava.

606
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:03,907
I mean, you wouldn't believe the size
of this thing. Humongous. Incredible.

607
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,699
Are you going
for Surgery too, Gina?

608
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:10,615
No, um, Pediatrics or
Medicine. I haven't decided yet.

609
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:12,824
DONALD: There aren't
a lot of women surgeons.

610
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:15,657
Why?

611
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,532
Yes, why is that, Donald?

612
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:25,323
Seems kind of obvious.
Surgery takes a lot of dedication.

613
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:27,341
It's not the kind of thing
you do for a couple of hours

614
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:29,615
and then go home
and be with the kids.

615
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:32,782
And, besides, the things we talk about
in there... tough for a woman to take.

616
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:36,657
Oh, I see. You'd have to
clean up your locker-room talk.

617
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,990
(Gina sighs)
That's bullshit.

618
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:43,031
What's the problem here? You're
not even interested in surgery.

619
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:45,156
Well, lucky for me that I'm not.

620
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:49,740
Excuse me. Bye.

621
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,699
(sighs)

622
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:55,824
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- Home.

623
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:58,424
Lauren, it's not your fault. You
didn't know any better. Come on.

624
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:02,323
- Come on. It's okay. They're our friends.
- No, they're your friends.

625
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,657
If I'd asked you to come spend tonight
with my friends, you would've said no.

626
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,907
Hey, these people
are where our life is.

627
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,323
Where your life is, not mine.

628
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:13,907
I'm tired.
I'd like to go.

629
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,907
I'm stayin'.

630
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,073

639
00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:54,800
Uh, listen, I wonder if I can buy you a
beer, and maybe talk over some notes...

640
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:57,073

(beeps)

642
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:05,740
Michael, this is your father.

643
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:07,966
Your mother gave me your
number. I just wanted you to know

644
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,323
that I'll be coming to scrub
with Redding next month,

645
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,657
and I thought you
might like to know, and...

646
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,156
Well, I'll see you there perhaps
if we get a minute, okay?

647
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,990
Have a nice holiday.

648
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,407
(beeps)

649
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,240

00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,532
- (Hayes humming)
- (Suzanne laughing)

651
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:47,490
Hayes.

652
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:23,281
Uh, good morning.

653
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:26,031
Good morning.

654
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:28,490
- Oh, God!
- What time is it?

655
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:31,198
- 6:30.
- 6:30?!

656
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:36,073
Uh, listen, can I, uh,
take the top one? I'll bring it right back.

657
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:38,073
- Yeah.
- You're sure you don't mind?

658
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,365
- No.
- Good.

659
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:44,240
Uh, I'm gonna use my bathroom.
It's got all my stuff.

660
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:46,323
Okay.

661
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:49,407
Oh, my God!
What have I done?

662
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,532
Oh, my God.

663
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:59,073
Well, Hayes.
You have done it this time.

664
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:03,240
- Oh!
- (chuckles)

665
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:05,407
- Hi.
- How are ya?

666
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,573
I'm great. I'm just...
I'm great. And how are you?

667
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:11,740
- Great, great.
- (clears throat)

668
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,198
I'm great too. Me,
I'm great. Thanks for asking.

669
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,448
See ya.

670
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,573
What's goin' on, Hayes?

671
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:29,281
Okay, Hayes, you wanna tell me
what's goin' on here?

672
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:35,949
Me and Suzanne...
We did the wild thing.

673
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:39,240
You slept with Suzanne?

674
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,240
I thought you guys
were just friends.

675
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:44,031
We are. We...
Well, we were.

676
00:42:44,115 --> 00:42:46,031
Now I'm not so sure.

677
00:42:46,115 --> 00:42:48,949
- Well, have you talked to her about it?
- Not exactly, no.

678
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:51,949
- Hayes, you've gotta talk to her.
- I know. I know.

679
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,198
(sighs) All right,
look, don't be stupid.

680
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:57,323
This could be the greatest thing that
ever happened to your relationship.

681
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,907
Okay, maybe not.
How... How was it?

682
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,240
Well, that's the problem.
See, it-it was really good,

683
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:07,281
but it wasn't great.

684
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:10,073
- How about for Suzanne?
- Oh, that's the worst of it.

685
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:12,782
See, for Suzanne,
I think it was, uh,

686
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:14,907
unbelievable.

687
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,448
It was okay.

688
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:20,281
(chuckles)
How was it for Hayes?

689
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:23,532
- He thought it was incredible.
- (laughing)

690
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:30,657
(knocking)

691
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,573
- Why are you here?
- I came to check up on things.

692
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,532
Hmm.

693
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:44,365
Haven't you graduated, or whatever
they call it, from this rotation?

694
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:47,031
You don't exactly graduate. But,
yeah, I'm in Pediatrics now.

695
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:49,407
I just came down to make sure
you weren't scaring anyone.

696
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,824
You seem to be doing better.

697
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:55,990
Your weight looks good.

698
00:43:56,073 --> 00:44:02,198
Why don't you ask me if I am
doing better? Or is that taboo?

699
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,115
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:06,115
How do you feel you're doing
with the treatment?

701
00:44:06,198 --> 00:44:08,657
Fine.
Thank you.

702
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,615
(chuckles)
Good.

703
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:15,365
The important thing
is for you to ask.

704
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:18,115
Now, how is your
competition progressing?

705
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,073
Fine, I guess.

706
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:23,156
- Don't you know?
- I just didn't know you were interested.

707
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,490
I simply like to know that whoever's
working on me is competent.

708
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:29,365
That's all.

709
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,990
(monitor beeping)

710
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:50,782
Good morning, Dr. Chatham.
Dr. Redding.

711
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:09,699
- How are we looking there, Dr. Ballentine?
- All set, Doctor.

712
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:11,907
- All set to go?
- Yes, sir.

713
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,740
- We're ready, Dr. Chatham.
- We'll go in between the fifth and sixth ribs.

714
00:45:15,824 --> 00:45:17,907
- Give me a scalpel, please.
- NURSE: scalpel.

715
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,782
- DR. CHATHAM: I need the rib spreader.
- NURSE: rib spreader.

716
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:22,615
- Sponge.
- Sponge.

717
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:25,615
- Have a little bleeding present. Cautery.
- Cautery.

718
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,740
Mayo scissors.

719
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:39,198
MAN: Dr. Chatham,
it was great working with you.

720
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:42,240
- It's a pleasure working with you.
- Thanks. Good to meet you.

721
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:49,740
So you're doing well here?
Honoring?

722
00:45:49,824 --> 00:45:53,824
Well, so far in everything but
Medicine. There's some stiff competition.

723
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:58,073
You're in one of the best med schools
in the nation. What'd you expect?

724
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:02,573
I remember when you were in the
national 14-and-under tennis finals.

725
00:46:02,657 --> 00:46:06,657
You breezed through the first
four rounds without dropping a set.

726
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,115
Then you came up
against that kid, uh, Gomez.

727
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:11,115
- You remember?
- Yeah.

728
00:46:11,198 --> 00:46:14,281
He beat you the first set,
and then you let down.

729
00:46:14,365 --> 00:46:17,782
You were better. You were
much better than he was.

730
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:22,448
But when you let down, he took advantage
of you and he beat you three straight sets.

731
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:26,699
Afterwards, I never saw you drop
your guard again. Don't do it now.

732
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,865
That was 10 years ago. How'd
you remember that kid's name?

733
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:32,990
It was a pivotal moment.

734
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,490
You always remember
the pivotal moments.

735
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:38,824
- Good to see you, Son.
- You too, Dad.

736
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:53,115
(soft rock on jukebox)

737
00:46:53,198 --> 00:46:55,824
- Draft, please.
- Sure.

738
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,699
Hi.

739
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:02,782
Mind if I sit?

740
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,782
Meeting someone?

741
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:07,782
- No.
- Sure.

742
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:11,824
- BARTENDER: Here you go.
- Thanks.

743
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:13,990
Sure.

744
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:17,240
Why is it that when a guy comes
into a bar to be alone with his drink,

745
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:19,365
no one thinks twice about it?

746
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:23,532
But when a woman comes in alone, everyone
assumes she's waiting to be picked up?

747
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:27,573
- Why is that?
- I have no idea.

748
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,156
(chuckles)

749
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,281
You know, your father
really is a terrific surgeon.

750
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:40,657
I guess you've heard that
a million times.

751
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,782
Yeah.
About a million and one.

752
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:52,198
You know,
I was eight years old before I found out

753
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:54,115
his first name
wasn't "Doctor."

754
00:47:54,198 --> 00:47:56,615
(laughs)

755
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,532
All the time
that he lived at home,

756
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:01,424
I used to go to the hospital
and make rounds with him.

757
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:04,782
I loved the way people
there treated him. They...

758
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:07,615
Like he was royalty, you know?
"Dr. Chatham, we need you for this.

759
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:10,365
Dr. Chatham,
we need you for that."

760
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:13,782
It wasn't long before I realized those
people knew him better than I did.

761
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:19,031
And I wanted to be just
like him and as good as him.

762
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:21,615
I mean, so that
he would talk to me too.

763
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:25,532
What gets me
worse than anything,

764
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:28,949
even now,
like today when I see him...

765
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,573
Yeah.

766
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:34,990
I feel exactly like I felt
when I was eight years old.

767
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,782
I'm still trying.

768
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:49,365
I'll leave you by yourself.

769
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:00,407
What do you recommend,
Dr. Hayes?

770
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,466
Well, given the little
girl's allergy to penicillin,

771
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,407
I recommend we start her
on erythromycin.

772
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,490
- Mm-hmm. Sounds good.
- Here you go, sweetheart.

773
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:09,990
We'll have you feelin' better
in a flash. Bye-bye.

774
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,365
(coughs)
Thank you, Doctor.

775
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:14,323
Be well.

776
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:16,549
For your cough,
all you need to do is when you go home,

777
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,341
grind up about seven or eight
peppercorns and mix it with some honey.

778
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:19,782
It'll take care of your throat.

779
00:49:19,865 --> 00:49:20,865
- Really?
- Yeah.

780
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,949
- I'll try it.
- Okay.

781
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,365
Peppercorns and honey?
Is that some new combination

782
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:28,657
they taught you in pharmacology?

783
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,448
-Oh. Well,
I... -What do you suggest after that?

784
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:34,990
Eye of newt? Hmm?
Three eagle feathers?

785
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:37,198
Jump up three times
and bark at the moon?

786
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:39,990
It's sort of a secret
family recipe, actually.

787
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:45,198
Well, I suggest that you keep it just that,
Dr. Maloney... a secret.

788
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:47,615
You see, when a patient
receives information from you,

789
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:50,490
they perceive it
as coming from a doctor.

790
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:53,865
And you are not a doctor.

791
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:59,156
What specialty
are you heading for?

792
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,490
Well, I was hoping Pediatrics.

793
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,907
Good luck.

794
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:20,073
(sighs)

795
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:31,281

- Do you need some help?
- No, no.

802
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:55,615
I've got it all under control.

803
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:58,365
Uh... Oh, boy.
Um...

804
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:00,281
Uh...

805
00:51:00,365 --> 00:51:02,699
Uh... (chuckles)

806
00:51:02,782 --> 00:51:05,240
So they brought this guy
up from Psych for X-ray.

807
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:08,532
A swallower. Pencils,
pennies... you name it, he'd eat it.

808
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:10,532
Unfortunately, nobody
bothered to tell me that.

809
00:51:10,615 --> 00:51:12,573
What I got is that
this guy's ready for release.

810
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:14,573
- Oh, no, Hayes.
- Oh, yeah.

811
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:17,240
- He had the form and everything.
- You didn't release him?

812
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:21,990
Oh, no, no, no, no. He ate my pen
before I got the chance to sign the form.

813
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:35,323
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

814
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,949
- Mmm.
- Oh.

815
00:52:05,198 --> 00:52:08,073
(sighs)
I'm really tired.

816
00:52:09,615 --> 00:52:13,073
- Maybe we should just go to sleep.
- Okay, you're right.

817
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:23,365
- Good night.
- Good night.

818
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:27,990
- Are you comfortable?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

819
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:30,365
Okay.

820
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,699
Hey, Billy, your blood is tired.

821
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:41,182
We're gonna give you a
transfusion to make you feel stronger.

822
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,740
BILLY:
Will it hurt?

823
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:46,091
Well, it might sting a little when I first
put in the needle, but I'm pretty good at it.

824
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:48,657
After that, it won't hurt a bit.

825
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,907
Okay, relax.

826
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,657
Dr. Kelly said to go ahead.
The tests are fine.

827
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,573
Great. A little alcohol.
It feels cold.

828
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:06,657
All right. Now,
that didn't hurt a bit, did it?

829
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:11,156
- Mm-mm.
- Okay. There you go.

830
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,365
- NURSE: Want me to connect the tubing?
- Yeah, I'll take it.

831
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:17,740
There you go.

832
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:21,657
Now just relax.
Take a deep breath.

833
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,949
- That's good.
- (grunting)

834
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,198
What's happening?
Oh, my God! Get help!

835
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:30,615
Get some help in here!
Suzanne, go get some help!

836
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:32,865
(alarm blaring)

837
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:37,198
Code blue! We need some help here,
stat! Dr. Redding, 213!

838
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:39,865
Get his head up!
What's happening?

839
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:42,615
- What happened?
- Convulsions. I don't know what happened.

840
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,907
All right.
Let me get in here. Come on.

841
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:49,448
There's no pulse. All right.
He's coding. Get the cart in here.

842
00:53:49,532 --> 00:53:52,365
Come on.
We need to get him intubated.

843
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:56,699
Let's get that monitor on.
Get the board under him.

844
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:59,323
Lift him up.

845
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,115
All right. I'm starting
compressions. Ambu-bag.

846
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,615
(sustained tone)

847
00:54:14,156 --> 00:54:16,490
One amp bicarb, one amp epi.

848
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,615
Can I see a rhythm strip?

849
00:54:21,824 --> 00:54:24,281
Was there any seizure disorder
on the chart?

850
00:54:24,365 --> 00:54:26,407
No, none.

851
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,615
- How long has he been like this?
- Two minutes.

852
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:32,281
- What was his diagnosis?
- Anemia.

853
00:54:32,365 --> 00:54:34,824
All right.
Let's get ready.

854
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,573
All right.
We're charged here.

855
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:43,699
Ready for defib.
Stand back.

856
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,949
- (tone continues)
- NURSE: There's no response.

857
00:54:49,031 --> 00:54:51,782
Again. Stand back.

858
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:53,699
- (defibrillator clicks)
- (gasps)

859
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:57,532
Nothing. All right.
I'm going manual.

860
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:04,782
There's nothing on the
monitor. We're losing him.

861
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,615
Bretylium.

862
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,824
(whimpers)

863
00:55:08,907 --> 00:55:11,281
Isuprel.

864
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:13,490
All right.
Let's defib him again.

865
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:17,115
All right.
We're going again. Stand back.

866
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:20,657
- (defibrillator clicks)
- (tone continues)

867
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,949
We're losing him here.
Come on, kid. Come on.

868
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,949
- Come on.
- Damn it!

869
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,740
Come on, kid. Come on.
Stand back.

870
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:30,490
NURSE:
still nothing.

871
00:55:30,573 --> 00:55:32,907
- I'm gonna go back to manual massage.
- (whimpers)

872
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,657
come on. Come on.
We're not gonna lose you here.

873
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,782
Come on.

874
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:50,407
- We lost him.
- (crying softly)

875
00:55:55,907 --> 00:55:57,990
- Time?
- NURSE: 11:58.

876
00:55:58,073 --> 00:56:01,031
(crying continues)

877
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:25,031
GINA: No,
I already left a message.

878
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,323
Look, when does Dr. Ballentine
get out of surgery?

879
00:56:29,782 --> 00:56:32,699
- He already got out?
- (knock at door)

880
00:56:32,782 --> 00:56:34,699
(chuckles)

881
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:38,532
Great. When did he
get out, please?

882
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:40,782
All right. Thank you.

883
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:47,448
- Hi.
- Hi.

884
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:53,240
- Come on in.
- Why don't you come out?

885
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:56,573
(sighs) Is this really
out here every day?

886
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:58,907
Nah. Only when
we're working.

887
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,407
(chuckles)

888
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,740
Go ahead. Say it.
Get it over with.

889
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:07,573
You don't think it was my fault...
what happened in there today.

890
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:11,740
Gina, come on. For every 10 things you
can test for, there's 100 that you can't.

891
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:13,990
He was my patient.

892
00:57:17,573 --> 00:57:21,573
Gina, there probably
isn't a doctor alive

893
00:57:21,657 --> 00:57:25,156
who hasn't felt responsible
for a patient's death.

894
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,407
I mean, you do something,
and in spite of all your best knowledge,

895
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,657
it goes wrong.

896
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:35,156
It's not your fault.

897
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,490
Don't beat yourself up for it.

898
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:43,115
I don't know if I
can go back in there.

899
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:46,281
I don't know if I'm strong
enough to go back in there.

900
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:49,407
You are. I know you are.

901
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:54,115
I don't know if
I'm strong enough.

902
00:57:54,198 --> 00:57:56,657
You are.

903
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:00,198
(sighs)

904
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,407
(chuckles)

905
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:32,365
What are you doing here?

906
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:34,699
I got two urgent messages.

907
00:59:34,782 --> 00:59:37,073
I thought there was
something wrong.

908
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,490
I guess I made a mistake.

909
00:59:39,573 --> 00:59:42,633
If you were so worried, why didn't you
call right back when you got the messages?

910
00:59:42,657 --> 00:59:47,281
I don't call you right back, so then
you run off with the next best thing?

911
00:59:48,156 --> 00:59:50,323
Come on, Gina.

912
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:56,156
Oh, God. Donald,
you are a terrific surgeon.

913
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,907
But what I need right now is
somebody who cares about the way I feel,

914
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,115
and you're just not good at it.

915
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,490
I'm sorry.

916
01:00:10,657 --> 01:00:12,490
Shit.

917
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,448
This is surgery, folks,
not a picnic. Get 'em clean.

918
01:00:21,532 --> 01:00:24,281
- (humming)
- Your hands, Dr. Hayes.

919
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:26,448
- Go ahead.
- No, you, please.

920
01:00:26,532 --> 01:00:28,532
No, really.
You were first.

921
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,824
Hi.

922
01:00:34,782 --> 01:00:39,156
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

923
01:00:44,198 --> 01:00:46,949
Congratulations on Honors
in Pediatrics. Way to go.

924
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:51,782
You too. Double Honors.
Makes this the big showdown.

925
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,699
Good luck.

926
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:00,782
- ♪ Rescue me,
oh take me in your arms ♪ - (humming)

927
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,824
- ♪ Rescue me ♪
- ♪ Rescue me ♪

928
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:05,156
- ♪ I want your tender charm ♪
- (humming)

929
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,657
Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
the surgery rotation.

930
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,490
- ♪ I need you and your
love too ♪ - (chuckles)

931
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:17,156
Come on. I know you've
all been waiting for this.

932
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,323
- Sal, you wanna get that?
- ♪ Come on, baby ♪

933
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:22,407
- ♪ And rescue me ♪
- (clicks off)

934
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:33,156
All right, now, people.

935
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,699
Now, the tension
is so thick in here

936
01:01:34,782 --> 01:01:36,824
that I don't know whether
to cut it or the patient.

937
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:38,990
(sighs, clears throat)

938
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:43,448
Can we just concentrate
on the operation? Thank you.

939
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:47,073
All right. Now, today,
we have a simple cholecystectomy.

940
01:01:47,156 --> 01:01:49,699
If we don't traumatize
the surrounding tissue here,

941
01:01:49,782 --> 01:01:51,675
we can have this patient
going home in a couple days.

942
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:53,782
You ready, Dr. Ballentine?

943
01:01:53,865 --> 01:01:57,490
- DR. BALLENTINE: Let's do it.
- Okay, scalpel.

944
01:01:59,532 --> 01:02:04,115
Uh, Dr. Wyler, I'd like you
to perform the honors.

945
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:10,782
Now, if you can just make
an incision from here to here.

946
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:14,699
- Okay. From here to here?
- Mm-hmm.

947
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:17,115
(sighs)

948
01:02:21,824 --> 01:02:23,865
(gasps)

949
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,907
(sighs)

950
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,115
Okay. That's okay.
It's all right.

951
01:02:29,198 --> 01:02:31,949
I'll take it.

952
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:35,490
All right. The incision is made
here in the midline from here.

953
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:42,490
(gulps)

954
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:48,740
- At least he had the decency to wind up on the floor.
- (chuckling)

955
01:02:48,824 --> 01:02:50,990
- Vivian?
- VIVIAN: Yes?

956
01:02:53,824 --> 01:02:55,740
- Hi.
- Lauren, hi.

957
01:02:55,824 --> 01:02:58,240
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi.

958
01:02:58,323 --> 01:03:00,824
- What are you doing here?
- I got off early.

959
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:03,800
I thought I'd bring something. We
could have dinner together. Is that okay?

960
01:03:03,824 --> 01:03:05,907
I don't have time
to take a break.

961
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:09,490
- Not even to eat?
- I grabbed something earlier.

962
01:03:09,573 --> 01:03:12,990
I asked you if it would be okay if I
stopped by, and you said it would be.

963
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:15,448
Yeah. I thought
it was gonna be later.

964
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:17,841
Yeah, well, it can't be later, 'cause I'm
working a shift tonight. You know that.

965
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:20,091
- I don't remember what shift you're working on.
- Lucky you remember anything.

966
01:03:20,115 --> 01:03:23,740
- Goddamn it, I'm working.
- What do you think I'm doing every day and night?

967
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:32,281
All I want is 10 minutes with
my husband that I never see.

968
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:35,448
- I think we're gonna take a little walk.
- No. I'm sorry. Don't go.

969
01:03:35,532 --> 01:03:37,341
No, it's okay. There's
things that we need to do.

970
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:39,407
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

971
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:48,657
Dr. Rose, what if we were to come in under
the bed of the ninth rib instead of the 11th?

972
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,490
- Suction.
- We would risk traumatizing the pleural space,

973
01:03:52,573 --> 01:03:54,907
possibly resulting
in a pneumothorax.

974
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,573
What other approach
could we use? Hayes?

975
01:03:57,657 --> 01:03:59,824
Well, the patient has
a very large tumor,

976
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:03,156
and the added exposure by going in
through the ninth rib would lead me...

977
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,657
- Hang in there, Hayes.
- Come on, buddy. Hang in there.

978
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:10,156
I'm fine. I'm fine. It would
lead me to... use that approach.

979
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,156
I think you're right.
Are we all in agreement?

980
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,073
- Pressure looks good.
- Two-oh silk.

981
01:04:15,156 --> 01:04:17,323
- Suture.
- Dr. Chatham,

982
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:21,323
what if the patient were to spike tonight
in post-op and develop a distended abdomen?

983
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:24,031
- Clamp.
- Worry about intra-abdominal bleeding, check for sepsis.

984
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:25,865
What kind of workup
would you do?

985
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,657
Complete C.B.C. Look for
an increase in white count.

986
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,782
Get a blood culture,
urine culture, chest X-ray.

987
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:33,365
- More suction, please.
- Very good.

988
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:36,490
- Hemostat and sponge.
- Cut.

989
01:04:43,281 --> 01:04:45,031
- (instruments clattering)
- (chuckling)

990
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,281
Damn! Vivian.

991
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:03,448
Hayes?
How are you feeling?

992
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:07,281
I feel like we gotta
get out of this rotation soon

993
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:11,323
or I'm gonna end up
on that table myself.

994
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:15,240
- Redding thinks I'm an idiot.
- No, Redding thinks it's hilarious.

995
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:16,865
(chuckles)

996
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:24,323
You know, this is the longest
conversation that we've had in weeks.

997
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:30,990
You're my best friend, Hayes.
I miss that.

998
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:36,156
Having sex shouldn't interfere
with our friendship.

999
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,657
- But...
- It has.

1000
01:05:43,824 --> 01:05:46,782
- I miss my couch.
- I want my room back. (chuckles)

1001
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:50,448
(chuckles)
You got it.

1002
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,281
(laughs)

1003
01:05:56,365 --> 01:05:58,782
- Suz?
- Yeah?

1004
01:05:58,865 --> 01:06:00,949
It was nice though, wasn't it?

1005
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:04,365
(laughs) Yeah,
I'm telling all my friends.

1006
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:12,615
So where'd you learn that technique
of pulling up through the bottom?

1007
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:14,615
- Redding showed it to me.
- Oh, yeah?

1008
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:16,615
The first time
I've tried it though.

1009
01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:19,990
- Pretty impressive.
- Thanks.

1010
01:06:21,198 --> 01:06:24,865
Chatham, Ballentine wants you.

1011
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:30,532
(chattering)

1012
01:06:32,198 --> 01:06:34,198
Ballentine.

1013
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:39,490
- Is this your patient?
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:06:39,573 --> 01:06:42,633
- What's his condition?
- He's just been admitted for a workup for an enlarged liver,

1015
01:06:42,657 --> 01:06:45,198
a coin lesion to the lung,
needs an upper G.I.

1016
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:48,049
Well, instead of disappearing into the student
lounge, maybe you better start his workup...

1017
01:06:48,073 --> 01:06:52,824
E.K.G, lytes, chem panel,
urine for culture, stool for occult blood.

1018
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:55,156
Order an upper G.I.,
B.E. and a CAT scan.

1019
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,490
Get the results to me stat.
You understand?

1020
01:06:57,573 --> 01:07:00,115
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1021
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:07,407
(nurses chattering)

1022
01:07:20,115 --> 01:07:22,115
Rick, I need these right away.

1023
01:07:22,198 --> 01:07:24,657
- Oh, you need these now?
- Yeah, now.

1024
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:29,031
Rick. Buddy.

1025
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:31,990
Pal. Putz.

1026
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,281
Rick?

1027
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:54,907
Rick!

1028
01:07:59,323 --> 01:08:01,448
(knock at door)

1029
01:08:03,156 --> 01:08:05,198
(sighs)

1030
01:08:07,573 --> 01:08:11,073
- Cynthia, where's Dr. Ballentine?
- He's off all day.

1031
01:08:11,156 --> 01:08:13,156
What do you mean, "off"?

1032
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:22,824
Have those two workups run tomorrow, and
we'll put 'em on the schedule for next week.

1033
01:08:22,907 --> 01:08:25,907
- Chatham.
- Sir, sorry I'm late. I was delayed in lab.

1034
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:29,156
We were talking a bit
about abdominal masses.

1035
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,824
Someone can fill you in.
Good luck with that, Dr. Rose.

1036
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,657
Thank you, sir.

1037
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:43,865
- What's up?
- Another case came in. It's a renal cell carcinoma.

1038
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:45,782
They're gonna try to operate.

1039
01:08:45,865 --> 01:08:49,281
- Redding's gonna let Kenny scrub with him?
- Yeah.

1040
01:08:49,365 --> 01:08:52,782
That's great. I mean,
that's great. That's great.

1041
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:58,115
- Your patient's in room 218.
- Thanks, Suz.

1042
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:00,031
X-rays go pretty fast.

1043
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:08,323
Just couldn't stay away, huh?

1044
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:11,865
If you find that entrance line
humorous or calming,

1045
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,990
we have a major problem.

1046
01:09:14,073 --> 01:09:16,865
Well, you'll like
this one better.

1047
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:20,865
The chemo's worked.
We shrunk the tumor.

1048
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,490
What does Dr. Redding say?

1049
01:09:23,573 --> 01:09:25,657
He's got you ordered
for surgery in a week.

1050
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,323
He's also ordered you a new
diet and some supplemental fluids

1051
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:30,323
to get you up
to fighting strength.

1052
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:33,990
He thinks I'm too weak to
make it through the operation.

1053
01:09:34,073 --> 01:09:36,699
No, it's mainly to help you
after the operation.

1054
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:41,407
I told you before
I'd have none of that.

1055
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:45,240
- Of what?
- Bedside lying.

1056
01:09:46,907 --> 01:09:50,907
Miss Walker,
you're going to be just fine.

1057
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:53,365
That's better.

1058
01:09:55,907 --> 01:09:58,407
I almost believed you.

1059
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:02,407
Now get some rest.

1060
01:10:13,782 --> 01:10:17,031
(elevator doors open)

1061
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:19,365
- Don't I know you from somewhere?
- Hey, stranger.

1062
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:22,198
- Hi.
- Hi.

1063
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,198
Wait. Wait.

1064
01:10:24,281 --> 01:10:26,281
He's got his operation tomorrow.

1065
01:10:29,115 --> 01:10:32,699
(laughs)
Wait. Michael.

1066
01:10:32,782 --> 01:10:34,699
Come on.

1067
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:37,115
- Where?
- Let's go.

1068
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:39,365
(Gina chuckling)

1069
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:42,615
What?

1070
01:10:42,699 --> 01:10:45,824
(laughing)
Where are we going?

1071
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:50,573
(laughing continues)

1072
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:52,699
Michael.

1073
01:10:57,657 --> 01:11:00,657
(both laughing)

1074
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:16,824
(laughing continues)

1075
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:05,031
Oh, my God.

1076
01:13:00,782 --> 01:13:03,198
(laughing)

1077
01:13:03,281 --> 01:13:06,448
DR. REDDING: Tie this
vessel right here and...

1078
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:08,865
cut this.

1079
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:11,782
Scissors. Cut.

1080
01:13:14,949 --> 01:13:17,031
What do we have to
watch for here, Rose?

1081
01:13:17,115 --> 01:13:19,031
Superior mesenteric artery.

1082
01:13:19,115 --> 01:13:21,949
Cut right here.

1083
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,573
Scissors. Okay.

1084
01:13:32,323 --> 01:13:34,990
It's completely
encased the aorta.

1085
01:13:35,073 --> 01:13:37,466
We can't get it out without
compromising the intestinal blood supply.

1086
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:39,907
Well, what did the pre-op
I.V.P. show?

1087
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:42,240
The mass didn't cross
the midline.

1088
01:13:42,323 --> 01:13:43,907
All right.
We're out of here.

1089
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:47,490
(scoffs) Isn't there
something we can do?

1090
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:50,323
You know, Dr. Rose,
sometimes you have to know when to quit...

1091
01:13:50,407 --> 01:13:52,740
and hope to come back
to fight another day.

1092
01:13:52,824 --> 01:13:56,115
Maybe after some chemo,
we can come back in here, but... (sighs)

1093
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:59,865
Close him.
Two layers of nylon, please.

1094
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:03,240
Shit.

1095
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:06,407
DR. BALLENTINE: Go ahead,
man. Close him up.

1096
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:09,281
Suture. Pick-ups.

1097
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:24,198
How ya doin'?

1098
01:14:27,782 --> 01:14:29,699
Look, there's no way
you can test for that.

1099
01:14:29,782 --> 01:14:33,448
- It's not your fault.
- Come on.

1100
01:14:33,532 --> 01:14:36,115
- What do you care?
- What are you talking about?

1101
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:38,949
I could have tested for it.

1102
01:14:39,031 --> 01:14:42,532
- I should've thought of an angiogram.
- Next time.

1103
01:14:44,031 --> 01:14:47,281
What do you mean, "next time"?

1104
01:14:47,365 --> 01:14:49,532
You've got it
wrapped up, Chatham.

1105
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:00,407
(door opens, closes)

1106
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:25,865
I'm gonna stay at Nell's.
I left the number on the table.

1107
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,240
- For how long?
- I don't know. A while.

1108
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:45,782
I just gotta get through
this year on top.

1109
01:15:45,865 --> 01:15:47,907
You knew that
this would be hard.

1110
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,508
I knew you'd have to work. I
didn't know you'd have to resent me.

1111
01:15:50,532 --> 01:15:53,198
I don't resent you. I...

1112
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:57,865
Kenny, every time you walk in here
and I'm waiting for you, you resent me.

1113
01:15:57,949 --> 01:16:00,865
Every time I call you,
you resent me.

1114
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:05,281
Every time we go out with your
friends and I don't have anything to say...

1115
01:16:06,699 --> 01:16:10,281
Forget it. You don't hear,
and I can take that.

1116
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:15,949
What I can't take is how this
goddamn competition has changed you.

1117
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:18,657
(luggage zipper zipping)

1118
01:16:22,323 --> 01:16:25,323
You haven't made me
a part of things.

1119
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:45,448
The patient's weight is 120 pounds,
hemoglobin is up to 10.7.

1120
01:16:45,532 --> 01:16:48,633
However, future weight gain will not be
as dramatic... falling off by 20 percent...

1121
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:51,907
Therefore offsetting any advantage that
we may gain by delaying the operation.

1122
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,740
Very good.

1123
01:16:54,824 --> 01:16:58,990
Dr. Ballentine and I are gonna do our little
work in the O.R. so we can get you out of here.

1124
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:03,198
Well, it's about time everyone
stopped talking and did something.

1125
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:08,448
I agree. Dr. Ballentine is
gonna be performing the surgery,

1126
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:12,699
and I've also asked Dr. Chatham
to scrub so he can assist.

1127
01:17:12,782 --> 01:17:14,615
So we'll all be seeing you
in the O.R.

1128
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:17,323
Okay? Spirits up.

1129
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:26,865
- Are you nervous?
- No.

1130
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:30,699
Ah. That was good.

1131
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,365
I am scared.

1132
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:38,281
Oh,
don't be. There's no reason to be scared.

1133
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:41,990
Everyone here is the best. You
don't need to worry about it. I promise.

1134
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:44,657
Ah.
(chuckles)

1135
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,657
- Okay?
- Okay.

1136
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,782
I promise.

1137
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:52,073
Okay.

1138
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:59,156
(sighs)

1139
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,323
- DR. REDDING: Tie that blood vessel there.
- Debakey pick-ups.

1140
01:18:02,407 --> 01:18:04,740
- Suction.
- Clamp.

1141
01:18:04,824 --> 01:18:06,740
Chatham, what would you do next?

1142
01:18:06,824 --> 01:18:10,990
- Go through the omentum to the lesser sac, sir.
- Right.

1143
01:18:11,073 --> 01:18:14,153
Dr. Ballentine, why don't you let
Dr. Chatham work in here for a little while?

1144
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:21,156
Come on, Chatham.

1145
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,573
- Metzenbaums.
- NURSE: Metzenbaums.

1146
01:18:30,782 --> 01:18:32,031
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.

1147
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:33,740
So what's the game plan?

1148
01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:35,699
Chatham: Connect the
esophagus to the jejunum.

1149
01:18:35,782 --> 01:18:38,031
And how do you plan
to drain this?

1150
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:41,740
With a long N.G. tube
and multiple drains.

1151
01:19:30,657 --> 01:19:34,490
Let's get all the packs out of
here and take a sponge count.

1152
01:19:34,573 --> 01:19:37,490
- Don't wanna leave anything in there.
- NURSE: Yes, sir.

1153
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:41,490
Can you wrap up here?
I got a plane to catch.

1154
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:44,281
All right. Thanks very much,
people. You've been great.

1155
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,281
- Dr. Chatham?
- Yes, sir.

1156
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:52,031
- You did real good in there.
- Thank you, sir.

1157
01:19:52,115 --> 01:19:54,573
Why don't you
close up shop for us?

1158
01:19:56,198 --> 01:19:58,532
Yes, sir.

1159
01:19:58,615 --> 01:20:00,657
(clears throat)

1160
01:20:12,365 --> 01:20:14,448
WOMAN ON P.A.: Dr. Chatham,
report to post-op.

1161
01:20:14,532 --> 01:20:17,198
Dr. Michael Chatham
to post-op.

1162
01:20:21,281 --> 01:20:23,281
Sarah, how's she doing?

1163
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:25,949
I checked her last 20 minutes
ago. There's definitely a dip.

1164
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:28,699
- Dr. Ballentine leave any instructions?
- No.

1165
01:20:33,657 --> 01:20:35,865
Thank you.

1166
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,573
MICHAEL:
Dr. Ballentine.

1167
01:20:49,657 --> 01:20:51,824
Sir. Dr. Ballentine.

1168
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:54,490
- What?
- Henrietta Walker's condition is getting worse.

1169
01:20:54,573 --> 01:20:56,383
Her blood pressure's dropping,
her pulse is thready,

1170
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:58,657
and her urine output
is very low, sir.

1171
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:02,865
That's just third spacing after
abdominal surgery. It happens all the time.

1172
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:06,490
Sir, I know about third spacing.
I think this may be cardiac.

1173
01:21:06,573 --> 01:21:08,907
WOMAN ON P.A.: Dr. Ballentine,
report to E.R., stat.

1174
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,281
Dr. Ballentine to E.R.,
stat.

1175
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:16,365
Just increase her fluids
and keep an eye on her.

1176
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:18,699
Sir, I was thinking.
What about adding dopamine?

1177
01:21:18,782 --> 01:21:22,699
- If we did, it would increase her...
- Chatham, you think too much.

1178
01:21:22,782 --> 01:21:24,907
Just increase her fluids.

1179
01:21:35,365 --> 01:21:37,198
How is she doing?

1180
01:21:37,281 --> 01:21:40,532
B.P.'s way down,
and urine output's almost at 0.

1181
01:21:40,615 --> 01:21:42,615
HAYES:
What are you gonna do?

1182
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,740
(sighs)

1183
01:21:45,824 --> 01:21:48,740
(chattering)

1184
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:54,073
Dr. Ballentine? Excuse me. I need
to talk to you about Miss Walker.

1185
01:21:54,156 --> 01:21:56,156
- I can't right now.
- Sir, she's not responding.

1186
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,156
- We have to do something.
- Do what?

1187
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,907
She's not dehydrated, sir.
She's in cardiogenic shock.

1188
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,966
She needs some dopamine
to increase her cardiac output.

1189
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,341
Sir, I learned
about this in Medicine...

1190
01:22:04,365 --> 01:22:05,990
Look, every third-year student

1191
01:22:06,073 --> 01:22:08,240
thinks their patient has
what they just learned about.

1192
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:11,323
She'll respond to the fluids. I'll
get up there as soon as I can.

1193
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:15,865
- When's that? When she codes?
- Get the hell out of here.

1194
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,907
Look, the best thing you can do is
just let it go and hope for the best.

1195
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:28,907
- Did you try Redding?
- No, I can't reach him.

1196
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,573
- He's on a plane somewhere.
- You're stuck, man.

1197
01:22:31,657 --> 01:22:34,115
It's Ballentine's patient.
He's the doctor.

1198
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:36,365
- Chances are he's right.
- What if he's not?

1199
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:38,615
You can't buck protocol.

1200
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:42,490
They'll kick you out. You'll lose
the internship, everything. Go home.

1201
01:22:42,573 --> 01:22:46,031
You're beat. There's
nothing more you can do.

1202
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,740
Stat. (clears throat)

1203
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,115
Waiting on a co-signature.

1204
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,907
(beeping)

1205
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,031
(coughing)

1206
01:24:32,657 --> 01:24:35,532
Do you have any idea of the
seriousness of what you've done?

1207
01:24:35,615 --> 01:24:37,532
Yes, sir. Broke protocol.

1208
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:39,824
You cut yourself off
from the hospital.

1209
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:41,907
You challenged and overruled
a resident of mine

1210
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:44,281
whose experience outweighs you
by quite a few years.

1211
01:24:44,365 --> 01:24:48,490
Sir, it was clear Miss Walker was not
responding as expected to the medication.

1212
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:50,490
Her readouts were extremely low.

1213
01:24:50,573 --> 01:24:52,907
- I had to do something.
- No, Dr. Chatham.

1214
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,115
Dr. Ballentine
had to do something.

1215
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,240
He was also aware of the
factors affecting her condition,

1216
01:24:58,323 --> 01:25:01,657
and it was his studied opinion to
continue the medication as planned.

1217
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,573
Sir, he was not aware.

1218
01:25:03,657 --> 01:25:05,990
Well, then it's your
responsibility to make him aware.

1219
01:25:06,073 --> 01:25:09,407
At the moment, I thought the patient's life
was more important than the rules, sir.

1220
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:11,782
- What would you have done?
- That's not the point.

1221
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:13,907
I cannot run a program
where a student is allowed

1222
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:17,407
to act on his own,
no matter how good his intentions are.

1223
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:20,907
I would rather accept the
responsibility of breaking the rules

1224
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:22,782
than losing
a patient's life, sir.

1225
01:25:22,865 --> 01:25:24,990
And if your choice had
proved to be incorrect,

1226
01:25:25,073 --> 01:25:27,508
would you have been prepared to
accept the responsibility for her death?

1227
01:25:27,532 --> 01:25:32,782
Saving someone's life does not
make you infallible, Dr. Chatham.

1228
01:25:32,865 --> 01:25:34,865
We're human.
We make mistakes.

1229
01:25:34,949 --> 01:25:37,448
I think you have the makings
of a fine doctor,

1230
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:41,281
but you haven't even begun to experience
the complications of a human body.

1231
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:45,949
Now, until you're able to understand
the limits of your knowledge,

1232
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:48,824
I'm not gonna allow you
to practice in this hospital.

1233
01:25:51,865 --> 01:25:54,865
You're suspended from all duty
until further notice.

1234
01:25:58,448 --> 01:26:00,532
Yes, sir.

1235
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:07,990
(door opens, closes)

1236
01:26:08,073 --> 01:26:10,740
- (sighs)
- (slams book down)

1237
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:19,740
(sighs)
I don't believe it.

1238
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:27,407
I counted it up. I spent 68 hours
away from this place since we got here.

1239
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:29,573
That's 2.8 days.

1240
01:26:36,657 --> 01:26:38,740
I don't know where to go.

1241
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:31,907
MAN: Hey,
we need goblets on 16.

1242
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,031
WOMAN:
You got it.

1243
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:50,240
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

1244
01:27:50,323 --> 01:27:51,990
How's school?

1245
01:27:54,198 --> 01:27:55,907
Chatham got suspended.

1246
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:58,323
- What happened?
- Broke a rule.

1247
01:27:58,407 --> 01:28:00,782
He went against Ballentine.

1248
01:28:00,865 --> 01:28:02,407
Hmm.

1249
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:04,740
So I guess that makes you
number one.

1250
01:28:04,824 --> 01:28:07,323
Congratulations.

1251
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:13,865
The day you left,
I operated on this guy.

1252
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:19,824
We opened him up,
and there was nothing we could do for him.

1253
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:22,615
I felt so helpless.

1254
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:26,532
I would have done anything
to help that guy.

1255
01:28:27,365 --> 01:28:30,115
Michael felt the same way.

1256
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:32,699
The thing is,
he saved Ballentine's ass,

1257
01:28:32,782 --> 01:28:36,031
but he's getting screwed for it.

1258
01:28:40,031 --> 01:28:42,156
I don't know
what's important anymore.

1259
01:28:44,198 --> 01:28:50,407
Except... I know...
that you are.

1260
01:28:55,073 --> 01:28:57,240
Do you think you're coming home?

1261
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
- Dad.
- Michael.

1262
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:21,824
- What are you doing here?
- Your mother called me.

1263
01:29:21,907 --> 01:29:24,115
I wanna know what's happened.

1264
01:29:26,073 --> 01:29:28,657
I made a decision.
That's what happened.

1265
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:31,782
There's a lot of people who
think I did the wrong thing.

1266
01:29:31,865 --> 01:29:34,198
I know I did the right thing.

1267
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:36,657
I'm prepared to accept
the responsibility.

1268
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:40,365
Listen. When I
was starting out,

1269
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:44,448
I wanted to believe that
medicine was an exact science,

1270
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:47,365
but there are
too many variables,

1271
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,031
too many random possibilities.

1272
01:29:50,115 --> 01:29:53,865
I finally understood
that my instinct...

1273
01:29:53,949 --> 01:29:55,865
was as important
as my knowledge...

1274
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:58,365
That actually my knowledge
informed my instinct,

1275
01:29:58,448 --> 01:30:00,615
and that I should trust it.

1276
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:03,115
It took a lot of courage
to believe that.

1277
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,407
But I knew that if I turned my back
on something I really believed in

1278
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:10,365
that I'd never be able
to live with myself.

1279
01:30:10,448 --> 01:30:13,615
If you did something because
you really believed in it,

1280
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:16,448
you did the right thing, Son.

1281
01:30:20,073 --> 01:30:23,407
Is your hearing tomorrow?

1282
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:25,156
Yeah.

1283
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,448
Come on.
Let's talk about it.

1284
01:30:30,532 --> 01:30:33,252
Dr. Chatham, the facts of this
incident are pretty much on the table,

1285
01:30:33,323 --> 01:30:35,657
except for one area...

1286
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:41,407
Why Dr. Ballentine didn't respond to your
request for examination of Mrs. Walker.

1287
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:43,907
MICHAEL: I can't speak for Dr. Ballentine,
sir.

1288
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:48,490
MAN: Would you say that you had a close
relationship with the patient... Mrs. Walker?

1289
01:30:48,573 --> 01:30:52,740
- I knew her fairly well.
- "Fairly well"?

1290
01:30:52,824 --> 01:30:55,782
She was my patient
during my medicine rotation.

1291
01:30:55,865 --> 01:30:58,281
I've followed her progress
for the past several months.

1292
01:30:58,365 --> 01:31:03,031
And you kept up with her case even after
you had moved on to a different rotation?

1293
01:31:04,532 --> 01:31:06,782
Yes, sir. I was
interested in her progress.

1294
01:31:06,865 --> 01:31:10,281
Do you think it's possible, Doctor,
that your relationship with the patient

1295
01:31:10,365 --> 01:31:13,949
might have clouded your reasoning
and caused you to be unduly alarmed?

1296
01:31:14,031 --> 01:31:18,115
Perhaps even overemotional in
your conversations with Dr. Ballentine?

1297
01:31:18,198 --> 01:31:22,031
No, sir. That's impossible.
I responded to the evidence.

1298
01:31:22,115 --> 01:31:24,115
Michael, is there any reason
that you're aware of

1299
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:26,532
that Dr. Ballentine didn't
respond to your prompting?

1300
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:31,323
MAN: Dr. Ballentine is
an excellent physician.

1301
01:31:31,407 --> 01:31:33,949
He's been in this situation
numerous times.

1302
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:38,740
Now, given that information, can you think of
any reason why he should ignore your advice?

1303
01:31:46,073 --> 01:31:48,657
No, sir, I can't.

1304
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:51,240
MAN: Thank you, Doctor. The
board will review the information.

1305
01:31:51,323 --> 01:31:54,990
Dr. Redding will make a final
determination in a day or so.

1306
01:31:55,073 --> 01:31:58,156
- You may go.
- Thank you, sir.

1307
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,115
Dr. Redding.

1308
01:32:05,657 --> 01:32:07,365
Hey, Rose,

1309
01:32:07,448 --> 01:32:09,490
congratulations
on the internship.

1310
01:32:09,573 --> 01:32:12,532
It's not official yet,
but it will be. Way to go.

1311
01:32:14,407 --> 01:32:17,156
It was a pleasure
working with you, sir.

1312
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,073
Dr. Redding!

1313
01:32:20,281 --> 01:32:22,323
Dr. Rose.

1314
01:32:23,865 --> 01:32:26,365
- About Michael Chatham.
- Mm-hmm.

1315
01:32:26,448 --> 01:32:29,648
I thought you should know the problem
between him and Dr. Ballentine is personal.

1316
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:33,532
Michael's been seeing
Gina Wyler.

1317
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,699
Dr. Ballentine
had been dating her.

1318
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:39,115
Are you implying that Dr. Ballentine
would jeopardize a patient

1319
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:41,240
because of a problem
with Michael Chatham?

1320
01:32:41,323 --> 01:32:43,240
I'm saying it's a factor...

1321
01:32:43,323 --> 01:32:46,243
that hasn't been taken into consideration
in Michael Chatham's suspension.

1322
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:51,532
You understand if what you're telling me
has any bearing at all on his suspension,

1323
01:32:51,615 --> 01:32:54,031
you're the one that has
the most to lose by it?

1324
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:56,448
I guess that's why I'm here.

1325
01:32:56,532 --> 01:32:59,156
I'm the most credible person
you could hear this from.

1326
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:17,573
- Habit.
- She's doing fine.

1327
01:33:17,657 --> 01:33:19,573
- Gonna be released next week.
- Oh, yeah?

1328
01:33:19,657 --> 01:33:23,115
- Uh-huh.
- GINA: Michael.

1329
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:24,990
- Hi.
- Hi.

1330
01:33:25,073 --> 01:33:27,407
- I came by, but you haven't been home.
- I've been out.

1331
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:29,466
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you working tonight?

1332
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:31,907
Emergency. Listen, I think
that you should know,

1333
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:33,907
Kenny went to see Redding
about Donald.

1334
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:37,657
- What'd he say?
- Why don't you ask him?

1335
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:40,448
Will you come by
and visit me later?

1336
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:41,990
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1337
01:33:53,031 --> 01:33:55,115
Kenny.

1338
01:33:55,198 --> 01:33:59,907
- How's it going?
- Listen, I heard you talked to Redding.

1339
01:34:01,532 --> 01:34:04,824
Yeah. Don't hold your breath.
He wasn't knocked out by it.

1340
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:08,657
Why'd you do it? You got
the internship wrapped up.

1341
01:34:10,281 --> 01:34:13,031
Yeah, it looks that way.

1342
01:34:13,115 --> 01:34:15,615
But I wanted to win it.

1343
01:34:15,699 --> 01:34:17,841
In my mind, I didn't want an
asterisk up next to my name

1344
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:21,532
saying, "Michael Chatham
should've won this."

1345
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,907
Thanks.

1346
01:34:30,907 --> 01:34:33,407
Thanks.

1347
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:42,407
(siren wailing, distant)

1348
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:49,198
Doctor, we have multiple
incoming burn patients.

1349
01:34:53,156 --> 01:34:56,216
- God, what the hell happened?
- A tanker truck was rear-ended on the freeway.

1350
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,156
We've got 20 on the way.

1351
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,865
Okay, I want everyone available
down to E.R., stat.

1352
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:05,198
- (chattering)
- (sirens wailing)

1353
01:35:05,281 --> 01:35:08,448
Everybody on the double
out here! Come on! Stat! Stat!

1354
01:35:08,532 --> 01:35:10,615
(shouting)
The E.R.'s full!

1355
01:35:10,699 --> 01:35:13,115
What do we got here?
Is she alert?

1356
01:35:16,115 --> 01:35:19,115
I got a bleeder.
I'm gonna need some help here.

1357
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:21,949
The patient has no pulse.
We got a code blue.

1358
01:35:22,031 --> 01:35:24,365
Give me one amp epi,
one amp bicarb, stat.

1359
01:35:24,448 --> 01:35:26,758
We're gonna give you something
for the pain. Just take it easy.

1360
01:35:26,782 --> 01:35:29,591
- We're gonna get you cleaned up and out of here.
- Give me the three-oh silk.

1361
01:35:29,615 --> 01:35:31,865
DR. REDDING:
Hayes, you all right there?

1362
01:35:31,949 --> 01:35:34,031
Yeah. I got it.

1363
01:35:34,115 --> 01:35:36,115
MAN: Let's go! Move
it! Watch your back!

1364
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:47,573
- Give me a hand.
- WOMAN: Clear.

1365
01:35:47,657 --> 01:35:51,824
- We're gonna have to shock him.
- Coming through. Get out of the way, buddy.

1366
01:35:52,907 --> 01:35:57,073
- He's got a pneumothorax. Get the chest tube, suction.
- Yes, sir.

1367
01:35:57,156 --> 01:35:59,490
Get him prepped quick.

1368
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:04,824
Chatham, grab that patient
and get in here.

1369
01:36:04,907 --> 01:36:07,699
Come on, Chatham.
Get that patient over there.

1370
01:36:11,323 --> 01:36:13,448
All right.
Let's get the chest tube.

1371
01:36:13,532 --> 01:36:17,156
Hi, my name's Dr. Chatham.
Let's see what we got here.

1372
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,156
Xylocaine, one percent.

1373
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,323
Oh, he's gonna make it.
Okay, let's get the next one.

1374
01:36:33,865 --> 01:36:37,115
- Hey.
- Kenny.

1375
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:39,699
Dr. Rose, Chatham,
sit down, please.

1376
01:36:42,031 --> 01:36:44,073
(sighs)

1377
01:36:47,865 --> 01:36:50,782
Since you two are so relaxed,
I'm gonna dispense

1378
01:36:50,865 --> 01:36:52,949
with the formalities
and get to the point.

1379
01:36:53,031 --> 01:36:56,115
Chatham, as of today, your
suspension has been removed.

1380
01:36:56,198 --> 01:36:58,865
It is the decision of the board
that your actions,

1381
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:02,365
however irresponsible, were
motivated out of a set of circumstances

1382
01:37:02,448 --> 01:37:06,532
which fall outside
the protocols of the hospital.

1383
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:11,573
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

1384
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:15,156
Now, as to your futures.
Dr. Rose,

1385
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:18,990
your request for transfer to Chicago
Medical Center has been accepted.

1386
01:37:19,073 --> 01:37:21,156
You will complete
your fourth year there,

1387
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:24,490
and I've recommended you
for the internship in Surgery.

1388
01:37:24,573 --> 01:37:26,824
Thank you, sir.

1389
01:37:26,907 --> 01:37:28,865
Dr. Chatham,
that leaves you and me.

1390
01:37:28,949 --> 01:37:31,323
You will finish up
your fourth year here,

1391
01:37:31,407 --> 01:37:33,824
and I've approved you
for the surgery elective.

1392
01:37:33,907 --> 01:37:36,240
I thought we'd get a jump
on that internship.

1393
01:37:38,907 --> 01:37:40,907
Yes, sir.

1394
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:44,156
Hey, Suz, did you check that
stuff that makes the brakes work?

1395
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,490
The brake fluid?
Yes, Hayes.

1396
01:37:46,573 --> 01:37:48,854
Gas, gas. Did you check the
gas? Have you got a full tank?

1397
01:37:48,907 --> 01:37:53,365
Yes. And, you know, if I run out,
I just might be able to find a gas station.

1398
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:56,532
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1399
01:37:56,615 --> 01:37:58,699
I'm gonna miss you, Hayes.

1400
01:37:58,782 --> 01:38:00,281
I mean,
you're only going to Denver.

1401
01:38:00,365 --> 01:38:02,281
It's not like you're
going to Mars or something.

1402
01:38:02,365 --> 01:38:06,532
Oh, why do you have to
go away for fourth year?

1403
01:38:06,615 --> 01:38:09,198
Because it's a better
pediatrics program for me.

1404
01:38:09,281 --> 01:38:11,198
How am I gonna get through this
without you?

1405
01:38:11,281 --> 01:38:14,699
The same way I will, Hayes.
On the telephone.

1406
01:38:14,782 --> 01:38:17,782
Hayes, give me a shot here.

1407
01:38:17,865 --> 01:38:19,699
You're taking that chair?

1408
01:38:19,782 --> 01:38:21,782
- That's my favorite chair.
- Here.

1409
01:38:21,865 --> 01:38:25,699
The only reason I agreed to switch
houses with you lovebirds is this chair.

1410
01:38:25,782 --> 01:38:29,240
- No chair, no move.
- Did you clean your bathroom?

1411
01:38:29,323 --> 01:38:31,532
Well, I...

1412
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:34,699
You clean your bathroom,
and you can have the chair.

1413
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:43,031
- That's what I thought.
- I'll go first.

1414
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:50,240
- A lot of action...
- Hey.

1415
01:38:50,323 --> 01:38:52,031
Hey.

1416
01:38:53,156 --> 01:38:55,073
- Hey.
- Hey, Lauren.

1417
01:38:55,156 --> 01:38:59,073
- Good luck in school, Michael.
- You too. Kenny.

1418
01:38:59,156 --> 01:39:01,156
- You keep Redding on his toes.
- You bet.

1419
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,633
- I'm gonna miss you in the O.R., man.
- Yeah, well, one day,

1420
01:39:03,657 --> 01:39:06,990
we'll call for a specialist at
our table, and you'll show up.

1421
01:39:07,073 --> 01:39:10,740
I look forward to scrubbing with you,
Dr. Rose.

1422
01:39:10,824 --> 01:39:13,573
- Dr. Chatham.
- Take care.

1423
01:39:13,657 --> 01:39:16,699
- Have a safe drive back there.
- Thanks.

1424
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:23,281
(engine starts)

1425
01:39:23,365 --> 01:39:25,115
See ya, guys.

1426
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:28,615
- KENNY: See ya, Michael.
- See you later.

1427
01:39:28,699 --> 01:39:31,448
- Suzanne, drive safe.
- I will. Take care of yourself.

1428
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:33,699
- Take care.
- (horn honking)

1429
01:39:33,782 --> 01:39:36,865
- Call. See ya.
- The oil!

1430
01:39:36,949 --> 01:39:39,031
- Suzanne, check the oil!
- Hey!

1431
01:39:39,115 --> 01:39:41,782
But it could leak.
