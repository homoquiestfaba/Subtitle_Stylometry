00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,315
Libby.

3
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,361
Libby.

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,115
Libby.

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,996
You did amazing work.

6
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,083
I knew I could count on you.

7
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,280
Peace or terror!

8
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,668
What a morning.

9
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:18,880
Students, welcome to
Course number 422, cap 23

10
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,884
Understanding
Contemporary Warfare.

11
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,469
I apologize for the hullabaloo

12
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:27,098
you may have encountered
entering the building

13
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,933
but it was a one-off,
I can assure you.

14
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,519
As you may or may not be aware

15
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,106
Professor Shimka, who was
scheduled to teach this course

16
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,692
suffered a heart attack
some weeks back.

17
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,819
In his stead, we are honored

18
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,822
to have secured
the services and talents

19
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,034
of one of the most brilliant
and innovative minds

20
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,663
in American foreign policy
today, Elizabeth Lamm.

21
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,957
Elizabeth received her BA
from Princeton

22
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,336
and her Ph.D.
from the University of Chicago.

23
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:01,257
Fluent in French,
Japanese, Pashtu..

24
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,449
Winter break, I'm getting
the left hip replaced.

25
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,577
End of the school year,
the right one.

26
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,079
Already, I've had
both knees worked on.

27
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,123
I have the best orthopedic guy,
if you're ever in need.

28
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,293
- Not yet, anyway.
- Willa?

29
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,503
Oh, how did it go?
How crazy was it?

30
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,630
Were arrests made?

31
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,839
Campus cops handled it
with aplomb

32
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:44,384
a very pleasant surprise.

33
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,885
Wouldn't you agree, Elizabeth?

34
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,803
Yes, security was excellent.

35
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,639
Gracious, my manners.

36
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,182
Everything's moved so fast

37
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,351
I forget you've only
just arrived.

38
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,105
Elizabeth, this is Dee.

39
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,606
Elizabeth.

40
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:06,781
Without Dee, the office would come
to a grinding and very messy halt.

41
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,949
Whatever you need,
just let us know.

42
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,868
Thank you. I will.

43
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,536
Martin!

44
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,788
There he is,
my phantom roommate

45
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,125
the international
man of mystery.

46
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,252
- Jordan.
- Where you've been?

47
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,336
Like, I know we've
only known each other

48
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,546
a short time, but I worry.

49
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,714
It's my nature, right?

50
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,591
I'm like my Jewish
grandmother that way.

51
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:29,055
Just, uh, just shoot me
a text, or something.

52
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,889
"Great seeing you too, Jordan."

53
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,392
Thanks for givin' a shit.

54
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,685
You're right, I could've
fallen in a lake and drowned.

55
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,272
- No one would ever have known.
- Thank you.

56
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,569
Hey, any time, roomie.

57
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,159
And this is you.

58
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,252
I'm afraid it's rather Spartan
in terms of creature comforts.

59
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,964
It's perfect, actually.

60
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,050
Well, it may not
be Foggy Bottom

61
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,596
but welcome to academia.

62
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,889
Once everyone gets
to know you, Elizabeth

63
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,267
I think you'll find we have
a good bunch of folks here.

64
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,810
Hearts are in the right place.

65
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,521
It's fine.

66
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,108
I'm used to it. Really.

67
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,111
October 21st, 1805

68
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,947
Napoleon's Navy,
under the command

69
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,284
of Admiral
Pierre de Villenueve

70
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:37,372
is wiped out
by the British Fleet

71
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:42,543
under the command
of Admiral Horatio Nelson.

72
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:47,005
This engagement, known as
the Battle of Trafalgar

73
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,966
establishes Britain's dominance

74
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:54,971
of the high seas
for the century to come.

75
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,183
Surprisingly,
such a stinging defeat

76
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:01,478
does little to deter Napoleon.

77
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,065
If anything, his obsession

78
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,067
with crossing the Channel

79
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,860
only grows after Trafalgar.

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,531
- Am I interrupting?
- Not at all.

81
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,449
Couple of housekeeping matters.

82
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,702
Would you prefer using your
own email for correspondence?

83
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,329
Or I can set you up
with a department address?

84
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,788
Neither.

85
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,873
I'm old school that way.

86
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,668
- Really?
- Really.

87
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,421
- I prefer hard copies.
- Okay.

88
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,171
Can I have your cell number
for the office?

89
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,673
Don't have one.

90
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,841
You don't have a cell phone?

91
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,218
No, I don't.

92
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,344
Home phone number.

93
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,430
Sorry.

94
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,224
Well, how do you communicate
with the world?

95
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,185
Slowly.

96
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,920
It's all so close, isn't it?

97
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,214
The pieces, the stars

98
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,967
they are aligning.

99
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,223
What a view you have here.

100
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,142
Majestic.

101
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,436
The entire compound
is just breathtaking.

102
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:10,858
Thank you. It's been
in my family for generations.

103
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,445
I don't really like the lake.

104
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,323
Too many bugs, water's too cold,
no sand.

105
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,786
I know, right? Poor me.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,793
You're having doubts.

107
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,886
By that definition, the US
military uses WMDs every day

108
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,222
and theoretically could be
prosecuted by foreign governments

109
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,848
if they were to adopt
a similar law.

110
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,435
For example,
the N67 hand grenade

111
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:14,523
is a fragmentation device with an
explosive charge of 6.5 ounces.

112
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,402
So, it qualifies as a WMD
on two counts.

113
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,403
Dannisha?

114
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,405
When you say "Prosecuted

115
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,656
by foreign governments"

116
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,575
you mean prosecuted
as war criminals.

117
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:29,497
That exact definition,
that wording

118
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,085
I believe, is a matter
for the courts to decide.

119
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,094
Does a figure this polarizing
earn the right

120
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,180
to be given a platform like
this just for her notoriety?

121
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,682
Some will say yes,
uh, some will say no.

122
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,977
Some will say she shouldn't
even be walking free.

123
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,478
But you have to look
to the GU administration

124
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,732
for the real reason
behind this.

125
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,733
Money.

126
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,408
- Oh, fuck.
- What the fuck?

127
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,910
Now, Martin, you show up now?

128
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,704
Just leavin'.

129
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,914
What, hold, we can go
in my room. You don't have to...

130
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,752
No, I'm out of here. Thanks.

131
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,297
What was he doing
in the dark like that?

132
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,300
This is what I've been saying.

133
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,108
I am concerned much of
the analysis is unsubstantiated.

134
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,984
Some will say
it's all circumstantial.

135
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,237
But that's nonsense. Do you
think it's circumstantial?

136
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,199
No, I do not. But wanting
to believe something...

137
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,535
Do you realize that Pearl Harbor

138
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,122
to V-J Day was less than
four years?

139
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,791
A world at war,
and we ended it..

140
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,710
...just that quickly?

141
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:03,257
This thing has been going on
since the turn of the century.

142
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,175
We have turned a side show
into the main event.

143
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,595
But the response
has to be specific, surgical.

144
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,307
I do think we need to take into account
the reactions, both at home and abroad.

145
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,020
Doesn't it bother you
that the idea

146
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,190
of American exceptionalism
is an anachronism?

147
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,400
Of course.

148
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,484
We're a rudderless ship

149
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,903
where just getting by
is enough.

150
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,366
And Los Angeles certainly showed
how tenuous even that is.

151
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,701
If Maleki's tire
does not blow out

152
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,994
if the CHP does not pull over

153
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,873
if Maleki does not panic.

154
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,542
If, if, if!

155
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,295
An if prevented a catastrophe

156
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,172
that would've made 9/11
look like a footnote.

157
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,261
Now, I don't sleep well at night
knowing that.

158
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,558
We have to win this war.
Total victory.

159
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,057
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

160
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,517
So you want
all of these changed?

161
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,310
Plus the mudroom and back door.

162
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,104
I wanna add
more locks there, too.

163
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,980
A different key for each.

164
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:24,900
Okay.

165
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,737
You have a robbery?

166
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,155
No.

167
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,574
Not happy
with your alarm system?

168
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,617
No, it's fine.

169
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,618
If you want cameras,
I have a guy.

170
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,870
No cameras.

171
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,831
Thanks.

172
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,836
I'll get to it.

173
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,625
Sorry if I, uh, spooked you guys
last night.

174
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,087
- Is he...
- No, Neal is gone.

175
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,142
Hey, uh, if we want
this roommate thing to work out

176
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,894
we need to communicate
a little bit better.

177
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,938
- You know what I mean?
- Uh, yeah.

178
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,856
So if you have a problem with
my bringing Neil back here...

179
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,359
Uh, I don't, I don't have
a problem with that.

180
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,902
- Okay, so what is your problem?
- I don't have a fucking..

181
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,117
I don't have a fucking problem.

182
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,578
Look, Martin, we don't really
know each other.

183
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,498
I've got the sense you're one of those
extremely gifted, self-motivated types.

184
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,920
Your test scores, the Ivy
League pedigree, the awards.

185
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,006
Frankly a little intimidating,
but I applaud all that, seriously.

186
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,257
It's just the sneaking around
that weirds me out a bit.

187
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,886
Sneaking around?
What the fuck does that mean?

188
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,681
You just seem really unhappy.

189
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,766
Maybe you should
talk to someone.

190
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,933
You know, if you want
a new roommate

191
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,934
you just go ahead and say it.

192
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,228
That's not what I'm saying.

193
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,063
Well, fuck it.

194
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,271
Opt room for a single
next semester.

195
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,356
That's not what I'm saying.

196
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,150
Hey, I get it, Jordan.

197
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,778
It's what I'm saying.

198
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,337
And the paper..

199
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,840
Is it good?

200
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,509
Our circulation
continues to dwindle.

201
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,346
Last time I checked,
uh, we had a grand total

202
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,224
of 43,000 subscribers.

203
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,392
The entire newsroom is comprised

204
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:51,814
of an ever-dwindling 25,
myself included.

205
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,776
Dwindling being key word here.

206
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,195
Can I help you?

207
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,160
At least they didn't
try to take a picture.

208
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,371
So sorry, Mr. Lamm,
just a couple of minutes

209
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,788
and your table will be ready.

210
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,873
Thank you very much.

211
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,882
You were saying about the paper?

212
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,052
Oh, th... tha... that's it,
really.

213
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,761
You know, sometimes I think
that leaving the Post

214
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,305
was the biggest mistake
of my professional career.

215
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,100
And then I remember

216
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,892
I wasn't even given a choice
in the matter.

217
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,563
Daddy, I am so sorry

218
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,273
if I had anything to do
with you losing...

219
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,817
That was not your fault.

220
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,404
You know that.

221
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,282
Even your mother has..

222
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,909
Does she know how I feel?

223
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,370
She read your letters, yes.

224
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,830
And she still refuses to see me.

225
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:52,083
We were so proud of you.

226
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,750
So proud
of your accomplishments.

227
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,670
Were.

228
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,924
And now you're ashamed.

229
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,841
We have to win this war.
Total victory.

230
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,635
Now, more than anyone

231
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:51,351
you... have done more
to prepare this country

232
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,145
for this moment.

233
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,107
So connect the dots
that need to be connected.

234
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:03,365
And if the stars
need help aligning, do so.

235
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,657
Talk to Adrian.

236
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,953
The DI is with us on this.

237
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,335
People wanna believe
what you say.

238
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,962
Use that gift.

239
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:25,426
And if you see this through
to its logical end

240
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:29,389
your future, your legacy

241
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,141
will be assured.

242
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,730
You will have served
your country honorably.

243
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,961
Do you see it?

244
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,381
Uh, found it.

245
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,011
It's quite beautiful.

246
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,388
Built in 1900

247
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,474
by the legendary J.D. McCarthy
Safe and Lock Company

248
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,558
out of Cincinnati.

249
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,978
It's in excellent condition.

250
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,106
The lock still works?

251
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:25,652
You look awfully familiar.
Have we met?

252
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,074
No, I'm afraid not.

253
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,076
Of course. Excuse me.

254
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,413
I just wanna say thank you
for your service to the country.

255
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,334
You did what had to be done,
and we're safer for it.

256
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,754
Well, thank you.

257
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:45,256
I'm glad you feel safe.

258
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,552
Well, let's open this bad boy.

259
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,774
Uh, a little help, please?

260
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,777
Continuing our discussion
of Clausewitz and war

261
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,279
in 1832, he wrote

262
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,449
"Kind-hearted people
might, of course, think

263
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,744
"there was some ingenious way
to disarm or defeat the enemy

264
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,536
"without too much bloodshed.

265
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,708
"It might imagine this as the
true goal of the art of war.

266
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,919
"Pleasant as it sounds

267
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,796
"it is a fallacy
that must be exposed.

268
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,632
"War is such
a dangerous business

269
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,508
"that mistakes
that come from kindness

270
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,346
are the very worst."

271
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:44,719
Hey, Libby.

272
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,430
It's good to see you.

273
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:50,349
Adrian.

274
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,938
- How late?
- About three.

275
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,857
Waiting for Amman to check in.

276
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,654
I missed waking up to you
this morning.

277
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:08,199
Me, too.

278
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,825
I guess I've become
kind of used to it.

279
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,745
Me, too.

280
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,748
The Amman call.
What you wanted to hear?

281
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,833
No.

282
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:19,209
What, the stars aren't aligning?

283
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,504
Not funny.

284
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,672
Did you tell Rachel?

285
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,882
Nope.

286
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,469
Are you waiting
for the right moment?

287
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,388
I don't think
there is a right moment.

288
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,057
She would like to see you.

289
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,980
Thanks. As if on cue.

290
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,491
Tonight.

291
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,599
The paper trail has to be...

292
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,642
Airtight. Commission-proof.

293
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,478
This is not just any op, Adrian.

294
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,854
I get it.

295
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,731
We are way past
cherry-picking evidence.

296
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,650
Understood.

297
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:27,614
Just think,
we can end this thing

298
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,782
once and for all.

299
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:35,119
Hey, your boss wants it done,
my boss wants it done.

300
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,953
That's good enough for me.

301
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,084
The intel has to be credible and
actionable, especially on Vahdat.

302
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,459
He is the key.

303
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,211
I'll get you visas,
travel itineraries,

304
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,131
whatever we can provide.

305
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,177
Now, put that pad away

306
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,971
and get back over here.

307
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,980
Can we talk... inside?

308
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,360
No, not inside.

309
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,278
Where, then? 'Cause I'm
not leaving till we do.

310
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,530
Follow me.

311
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,257
Yeah?

312
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,845
Hey, Martin, can I come in?

313
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,555
Yeah.

314
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:37,931
Hey.

315
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,182
Yeah?

316
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,768
Did you hear about Sunday?

317
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,270
No, what about Sunday?

318
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,189
Dr. Sipe is having
a get-together at her house

319
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:48,111
for faculty
and department grad students.

320
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,363
No, I didn't hear about that

321
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:55,699
but, um, thanks
for the heads-up.

322
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,287
Do you think you'll go?

323
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,037
Yeah, I do.

324
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,374
I hate going
to these things... alone.

325
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,210
Would it be okay
if we went together?

326
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,172
Sure.

327
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:10,717
Thank you.

328
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:18,264
So what's with the no phone,
no email

329
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,974
kind of, but not really
off the grid nonsense?

330
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,561
Keeps it all very simple.

331
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,604
I guess I should
congratulate you

332
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,067
on your appointment.

333
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,693
Chief of staff to the
President of the United States.

334
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,280
How does it feel?

335
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,784
It feels right.

336
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:42,081
Well, I'm glad
it all worked out for you.

337
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,918
We're concerned about you,
Libby.

338
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,961
We've reached out several times.

339
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,421
Reaching out in regard
to the President's intent

340
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,842
to run for re-election?

341
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,012
And the silence is deafening.

342
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,849
We need to make sure
you're still part of our team.

343
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,936
Are you, Libby,
still part of our team?

344
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,231
You flew all this way to hear me
answer that question.

345
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,818
I flew all this way to see you
answer that question.

346
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,530
I served faithfully.

347
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,451
I did everything
I was asked to do, everything.

348
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,079
Back then.

349
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,124
You don't..

350
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,918
- Does it ever give you...
- No.

351
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,795
A decision was made,
an order was given.

352
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,756
Period.

353
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,010
Easy as that.

354
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,305
Just the one thing.

355
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,309
What happened to you and me,
that did hurt.

356
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,313
But, Libby,
the understanding was

357
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,483
you'd resign and we'd all say
nice things about one another.

358
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,195
Presidential medals of freedom
and all that.

359
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,155
I'm not asking you to be
the centerpiece of the campaign.

360
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,450
I'm just looking
for a unified front.

361
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:05,037
You may have detractors, but your overall
favorable rating within the party is 70%.

362
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,539
So when I do reach out
and I hear nothing

363
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,208
I take that as a "Fuck you."

364
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,211
And being the trusting guy
that I am

365
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,463
I begin to think that maybe
Libby's having second thoughts

366
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,634
maybe Libby's thinking of airing
the family's dirty laundry.

367
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,474
I cannot overemphasize what a
colossally dangerous idea that would be.

368
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,684
Stop following me.

369
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,311
I know you have people watching.

370
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,813
I can assure you
it's not coming from my office.

371
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,358
How about your old buddies
at Langley?

372
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,860
Is that what's happening, Libby?
Are you suspicious of everyone now?

373
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:40,825
Like I said, tell your people
to leave me alone.

374
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,536
You're a very attractive woman,
Libby.

375
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:47,037
Sometimes the answer
to a problem

376
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,456
is a very simple explanation

377
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,210
an obvious one.

378
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,925
I'm here in good faith
because of your service

379
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,427
to the President
and the country.

380
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,807
Because Rachel still
considers you a friend.

381
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,061
I wouldn't be speaking here now
if it was otherwise.

382
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,938
So, I've been warned.

383
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:13,400
Counseled.

384
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,820
This memoir you threaten
to write has Rachel worried.

385
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,072
You're either with us
or against us.

386
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,867
It's as simple as that.

387
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,664
Let's talk again... soon, okay?

388
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,432
What now?

389
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:51,601
- Mingle.
- Beer first.

390
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,567
And I'll join you
if, uh, if that is okay.

391
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:00,654
Jordan, I know
I can be a first-class jerk.

392
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,240
I don't want
a single next semester

393
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,742
you're a great roommate, and I
think I can be a good one soon

394
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:08,786
if that works for you.

395
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,541
Does that mean
I can join you for that beer?

396
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,794
We're bonding.

397
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:36,981
Then they removed the damaged
cartilage and bone from the..

398
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:41,485
Now, here's my new word
of the day, acetabulum.

399
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,488
There's our new celebrity
and resident.

400
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,409
Elizabeth, so glad you made it.

401
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,204
Let me make some introductions.

402
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,498
I apologize for sounding
like my parents

403
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,083
but kids these days.

404
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,420
No matter how incoherent,
no matter how many typos

405
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,296
they still expect an A.

406
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,925
I'm talking about,
about basic grammar

407
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,177
middle school stuff.

408
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,929
I don't know how the hell
they expect an A

409
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,222
when they can't even put
a sentence together.

410
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,474
For that matter,
how the hell did they

411
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,769
get into this university?

412
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,604
I'm asking you.

413
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:19,065
Washington in the summer?

414
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,400
You can have it.

415
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:23,026
The humidity, the mosquitos.

416
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:23,947
Yuck.

417
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:28,159
Oh, you get used to it.

418
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,704
Enjoying the show?

419
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,831
Ah, the glamorous
Elizabeth Lamm.

420
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,918
The architect of Total Victory
and the Burke doctrine.

421
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,130
Kill one of ours,
we kill a thousand of yours.

422
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,382
Ain't that the gist of it?

423
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,800
Something like that, yeah.

424
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,010
Hmm. Have you met her?

425
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,470
Not yet.

426
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:50,890
Introduce yourself.

427
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,599
When the time's right.

428
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,976
So how long are you here for?

429
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,644
- The semester.
- Hmm.

430
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,229
And we'll see how it goes
after that.

431
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:03,025
Are you staying near campus
or in the city with the action?

432
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,068
Near campus.

433
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,485
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

434
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,780
How about you? You doing
the old meet-and-greet?

435
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,449
Oh, yeah, a couple of
"Hi, I'm Jordan Ritt.

436
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:12,869
That's Ritt with two Ts. So
thrilled to be taking your class."

437
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,746
Excellent conversation,
if I do say so myself.

438
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,248
Congratulations on that.

439
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,416
Yes, it is a fine art.

440
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,584
Big homes in that area, though.

441
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:23,463
It's a lot of house
for one person.

442
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,088
I like it. I like the space.

443
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,592
Really? You don't find it
too quiet, too lonely?

444
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,720
Uh, no.

445
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:31,890
Did you buy?

446
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,599
- Rent.
- Furnished?

447
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,516
Almost.

448
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:37,934
So what are you sleeping on?

449
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,272
Did they,
did they leave you a bed?

450
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,782
Elizabeth, how often do you
encounter protests these days?

451
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:54,452
I mean, was Tuesday an anomaly
or i... is it typical?

452
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,412
Now, I promised Elizabeth
there would be no grilling.

453
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,289
No inquisition, not tonight.

454
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,376
Willa, I'm just asking
Elizabeth if every time

455
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:03,628
she walks out into the world

456
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,295
she has to deal
with those haters.

457
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,298
It's okay, Willa, really.

458
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I see it on campuses still.

459
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,760
That's about it.

460
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:13,887
I resigned my post
four years ago.

461
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,974
After that, I was a figure
of controversy.

462
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,644
Protests were common.
People were upset.

463
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,896
But as time went by, it receded

464
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:26,318
and it was replaced
by new controversies.

465
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:28,485
Toynbee was right.

466
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:31,405
History's just one damn thing
after another.

467
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,365
But some things
are more damnable

468
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,244
than... than others,
aren't they, hm?

469
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,996
What you did was unconscionable.

470
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:40,789
Larry, not here.

471
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,126
Willa, you should be ashamed.

472
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,005
You bring this woman in?

473
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:50,340
All you guys.

474
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:54,012
Do you realize
what we're legitimizing here?

475
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,554
Larry, please.

476
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:58,307
We are all aware that liquor
brings out

477
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,934
your unfulfilled penchant
for theatrics.

478
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,021
What the fuck
does that even mean?

479
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:06,523
It means you're stupid drunk.

480
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,861
The only way
I can stand to be around her.

481
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,573
How many?

482
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,240
Come on.

483
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,744
You know the number.

484
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,080
How many people?

485
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,499
Based on the information that
was available at the time...

486
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:24,878
How many?

487
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:30,255
There's always the unknown,
the unkn...

488
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,257
Say it!!

489
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:33,508
Larry, drop this. Now.

490
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,112
The Amman intel changes
nothing.

491
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:36,780
Two, maybe three of our guys,
won't be there

492
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:37,782
at least not during the window.

493
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:38,907
Vahdat, what about Vahdat?

494
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,284
Not confirmed.

495
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,452
It changes nothing.

496
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:43,871
But we stress
that you're refutable.

497
00:43:43,873 --> 00:43:46,581
I mean, in and of itself, the
evidence at hand is overwhelming.

498
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,418
When we include the DI
from intel, yes. But...

499
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,963
But it's commission-proof,
correct?

500
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,755
Yes.

501
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:55,134
Alright, good enough for me.

502
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,139
I just want a moment alone
with Elizabeth, please.

503
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,313
There's one more thing.

504
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,941
I've changed my mind.

505
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:14,193
I'm recommending we now go
with Directive 7-12.

506
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:16,112
You were in agreement with the
more conventional approach...

507
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:19,072
It's a message
that has to be sent.

508
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,240
Libby, it's become clear to me

509
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,325
that this is much bigger
than Homs.

510
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,954
We are sending a message
to the world

511
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:26,998
"Don't fuck with us anymore."

512
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,999
The discussions with the DOD,
they've all been about this...

513
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,878
I, look, I've wrestled with it.

514
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:35,673
I'm convinced
the stars have aligned.

515
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:38,760
I'm urging you to reconsider
7-10. The multiple drones...

516
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:41,845
These people are like needles
in a haystack.

517
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,849
But to burn down
the entire barn..

518
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:48,896
When the moment comes,
you will know what to do.

519
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,164
Good evening.

520
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:55,583
Hey.

521
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:31,575
The rabid release of energy
in such an explosion

522
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:34,287
creates a shockwave equivalent
to several thousands pounds

523
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:37,874
of pressure per square inch,
enough to crush

524
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,376
uh, brick houses and human lungs

525
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:42,672
and most objects on earth.

526
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,802
Thus, we see the increased
incidents of leukemia

527
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:53,555
and thyroid, lung, breast,
and bone cancer...

528
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:57,017
Excuse me, Luis, class,
give me a minute, please.

529
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:58,271
I'll be right back.

530
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,329
What are you doing here?

531
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:19,248
I told you, we were gonna finish
our conversation.

532
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,833
Now you're threatening me.

533
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,168
I just want the answer
to the question.

534
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,795
Leave me alone.

535
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:24,755
- Libby...
- No!

536
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,215
- No what?
- No.

537
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,427
I'm no longer
on your fucking team!

538
00:49:33,764 --> 00:49:35,266
So we can't count on you.

539
00:49:36,434 --> 00:49:38,392
Count on me to tell the truth.

540
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:39,726
What, then?

541
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:42,604
Your memoir goes public
and you're at peace?

542
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,731
Why are you making this so hard
on yourself?

543
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,694
If you think
you're in the wilderness now..

544
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:58,329
Sorry, everyone. I have to go.

545
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:01,501
Class dismissed.
We'll, we'll make it up.

546
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:17,516
You say nothing
and nothing changes.

547
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,327
Put that down..

548
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:20,413
...and move slowly
away from the safe.

549
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:41,684
Sit on the bed.

550
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:46,271
Hands to your side,
palms on the covers.

551
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:53,528
You were following me.

552
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,070
Can you not point the gun
in my face?

553
00:51:55,072 --> 00:51:56,824
You are just a mother-fuckin'
stalker.

554
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:01,911
I would be within my right
to shoot you dead here and now.

555
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,412
No, I'm not that kind
of stalker.

556
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:04,496
Bullshit.

557
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:05,999
I'm not, Dr. Lamm.

558
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:09,168
You were in my class
and at Dr. Sipe's.

559
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,797
Yes, I'm a graduate student.

560
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:16,342
Were you sent here?

561
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:18,094
Is someone paying you?

562
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,014
Nope.

563
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:21,722
Then you have one chance
to answer

564
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:23,143
this question correctly.

565
00:52:24,226 --> 00:52:26,601
If I don't like what I hear

566
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:29,396
I'm either gonna kill you
or call the cops.

567
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:30,817
You don't have a phone.

568
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,199
Why are you here?

569
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:41,909
I'll put it this way.

570
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:43,994
Say I'm a Jew.

571
00:52:43,996 --> 00:52:45,829
I'm not. Say I am.

572
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:48,166
Now, as a child

573
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,333
I learned my grandparents

574
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:50,836
they were murdered
in Auschwitz.

575
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,090
What do I do?
I immerse myself in the subject.

576
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,595
All the camps,
attending horrors.

577
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:03,555
I study hard, I... I excel.

578
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:05,474
Full tuition, scholarships.

579
00:53:05,476 --> 00:53:08,603
Getting into, you know,
prestigious universities

580
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,229
both graduate and undergraduate.

581
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:13,526
Now, at said
graduate university..

582
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:17,572
...my first class,
on my first day..

583
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:23,202
...I look up and see Dr. Mengele
standing at the lectern.

584
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,873
For Dr. Mengele's been given
an honorary chair

585
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,376
in the political science
department

586
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,879
and will be lecturing me.

587
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:42,887
You have family there?

588
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:46,307
What you committed
was an atrocity..

589
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:47,894
...a crime against humanity.

590
00:53:51,606 --> 00:53:52,732
I..

591
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,653
We believed we were making
the world a safer place.

592
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,697
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- We believed we were protecti...

593
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:01,657
Shut up!

594
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:09,581
You're a fuckin' war criminal
and you should be hung as such.

595
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:18,425
What's your name?

596
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:21,344
My what?

597
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:26,349
Martin. Martin Salhi.

598
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:31,563
Okay, Martin Salhi.

599
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:34,524
You have your Mengele.

600
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,945
You're staring into the abyss.

601
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:42,615
Now what?

602
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,204
Do you wanna kill me?

603
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,627
Nah.

604
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,548
No.

605
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,633
I, um..

606
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:05,135
...I just wanna understand

607
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:06,472
how evil works.

608
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:10,974
Evil?

609
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:11,935
Yeah.

610
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:15,896
I wanna know everything. I wa..

611
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:19,316
Does it wear silk
or... or eat off fine china?

612
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,778
Does it drink latte?

613
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,153
How does it take the unthinkable

614
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:24,740
and... and make it real,
you know?

615
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:29,117
Does it have remorse? You know,
how... how does it keep going?

616
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,787
I wanna know the big questions

617
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:32,246
I wanna... I wanna know
the details.

618
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:33,414
I wanna know everything.

619
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:36,001
I wanna, I just wanna understand
everything.

620
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:40,382
Sit back down.

621
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:47,180
Please... Martin.

622
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:50,849
Sit back down.

623
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:12,163
Read it.

624
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,128
You wanna understand?

625
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:20,629
Read it.

626
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,132
All of it.

627
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:33,434
Start there.

628
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:37,436
Mr. President,
because time is of the essence

629
00:56:37,438 --> 00:56:39,896
I've asked my National Security
Affairs advisor

630
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:42,400
Elizabeth Lamm,
to address the group.

631
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,401
Elizabeth has taken
all the intel.

632
00:56:44,403 --> 00:56:46,403
Phone intercept,
satellite, imagery,

633
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:49,115
signals intelligence,
and human assets.

634
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,075
And I think you will agree

635
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:54,912
that her findings
are definitive and convincing

636
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:58,251
necessitating immediate
and total action..

637
00:56:59,335 --> 00:57:01,586
...if she may.

638
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,588
Smartest person in the room.

639
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,755
You bet.

640
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:06,592
Elizabeth, please.

641
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:20,647
Mr. President,
ladies and gentlemen.

642
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:24,816
We are currently presented with
a moment in time

643
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:27,278
in which a single, decisive act
could literally change

644
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,448
the course of history.

645
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:32,160
The evidence and opportunity
is undeniable.

646
00:57:33,494 --> 00:57:36,287
Omar al-Abadi, ISIL.

647
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:39,706
Kamal Lateef, Al Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula.

648
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:43,378
Sajad al Jubeir,
Jabhat al-Nusra.

649
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,630
Mohdar al-Hazmi, Hezbollah.

650
00:57:46,632 --> 00:57:50,510
Khalid Saadu, Jaysh al-Sham.

651
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:52,637
And Dr. S.Q. Vahdat

652
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,889
former head of the Atomic
Energy Organization of Iran.

653
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:59,351
And quite possibly, the most
dangerous man in the world.

654
00:57:59,353 --> 00:58:01,604
Unbeknownst to one another,
these six men

655
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:05,023
five leaders of terrorist
organizations and Dr. Vahdat

656
00:58:05,025 --> 00:58:07,651
a rogue agent dedicated
to the proliferation

657
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:09,820
of nuclear weapons technology

658
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:11,988
will all be in the same city

659
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,742
Homs, Syria, at the same time
this very evening.

660
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:17,494
Excuse me, Elizabeth.
Where is Homs, exactly?

661
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:21,166
Approximately 162 kilometers
north of Damascus.

662
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,421
- And that's...
- That's about 100 miles.

663
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:29,673
Got it. Thank you.

664
00:58:29,675 --> 00:58:31,633
Never did get
the damn metric system.

665
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:37,807
Our best estimate is a four-hour
overlap

666
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:41,226
between 10:00 p.m.
and 2:00 a.m. local time

667
00:58:41,228 --> 00:58:45,023
in which these known enemies
will be within the city of Homs,

668
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,400
all targets of opportunity.

669
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:51,778
A strike to the heart of Homs
at this moment would cripple

670
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,280
if not terminate

671
00:58:53,282 --> 00:58:55,365
the threat of terrorism
this country has faced

672
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:57,659
for nearly three decades

673
00:58:57,661 --> 00:59:00,664
at the cost of thousands of
lives and trillions of dollars.

674
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,624
It is approximately
7:05 p.m. local time

675
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:06,293
giving us just under five hours

676
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:08,338
to approve
and execute the action.

677
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,343
And what type of strike
are you proposing?

678
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,554
Well, we prepared three
scenarios, in which...

679
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:19,682
Um, Elizabeth? Excuse me.

680
00:59:19,684 --> 00:59:21,019
I'm... I'm gonna interrupt.

681
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:24,396
Ladies and gentlemen..

682
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:28,816
...if we act now

683
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:33,365
we can defeat these primeval
bastards once and for all.

684
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:38,617
Now, Elizabeth is gonna walk us
through some scenarios

685
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:41,244
but I am convinced..

686
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:45,250
...that our response should be
total and absolute.

687
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,961
Elizabeth, if you would
continue, please.

688
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:51,715
Thank you,
Madam Vice President.

689
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,188
What the vice president
and her staff

690
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,481
are advocating is unprecedented.

691
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:12,150
Whatever short-term gain
this action might achieve

692
01:00:12,152 --> 01:00:14,278
we would be opening
Pandora's Box.

693
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,780
We become the pariah.

694
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:18,700
May I remind the Admiral that
the 7-12 calls

695
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:20,325
for a tactical weapon.

696
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:22,202
Tactical nuclear weapon.

697
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:23,954
It has been the stated policy
of this nation

698
01:00:23,956 --> 01:00:26,624
never to be the first to use a
nuclear device in any conflict.

699
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:30,253
That has been a doctrine since
the end of the World War II.

700
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:31,628
He has a point, Rachel.

701
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,715
If you were president
at this moment

702
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,633
would you be willing to
personally authorize

703
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:37,135
a nuclear strike that would kill

704
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,845
countless innocent men,
women and children?

705
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:39,931
Yes.

706
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,974
The whole point of a deterrent

707
01:00:43,976 --> 01:00:46,687
is that our enemies need to know
we are prepared to use it.

708
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:51,441
They need to understand,
we will punish

709
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:55,235
their fathers and mothers,
husbands and wives and children.

710
01:00:55,237 --> 01:00:59,115
Everyone... they love and cherish

711
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:01,992
will be held accountable.

712
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:04,537
Now, it's a different century.

713
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:06,956
It's a different world.

714
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:11,168
This war on terror is unique
in terms of who the enemy is..

715
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,295
...and how to combat that enemy.

716
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:15,465
And if there is any doubt
about the stakes

717
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:20,052
need I remind everyone
at this table about Los Angeles?

718
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:23,180
Madam Vice President, there is
no credible evidence

719
01:01:23,182 --> 01:01:27,059
that Maleki had any connection
to Vahdat's group.

720
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:28,686
That's your opinion.

721
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:33,023
Mine, that Vahdat
and these gangsters

722
01:01:33,025 --> 01:01:35,568
are committed to detonating
a nuclear device

723
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,862
in an American city
in the next 24 months.

724
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:39,988
They don't have that capability.

725
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:41,367
Not yet!

726
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:49,374
Mr. President, our window
of opportunity

727
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:50,791
is under three hours

728
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:53,586
and there is nothing that I have
heard at this table

729
01:01:53,588 --> 01:01:57,550
that refutes Elizabeth's
analysis and evidence.

730
01:01:58,217 --> 01:02:00,550
In one fell swoop

731
01:02:00,552 --> 01:02:02,095
we can win this war

732
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:05,225
and end this worldwide scourge.

733
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:12,607
Elizabeth?

734
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:16,025
Yes, Mr. President?

735
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:17,401
Do you agree
with the vice president's

736
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:19,364
recommendation regarding
the 7-12?

737
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,742
Of course I do, Mr. President.

738
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:26,869
And you're confident
these six men

739
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:28,706
will be at this place
at this time?

740
01:02:32,376 --> 01:02:34,209
I am.

741
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:35,838
Especially Dr. Vahdat?

742
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:40,927
Yes, Mr. President.

743
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,566
You know..

744
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,778
...after I won my third
championship at Texas..

745
01:03:01,572 --> 01:03:03,613
...people just kept asking me

746
01:03:03,615 --> 01:03:06,659
"Coach, what's the secret
to winning?"

747
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:10,164
And I would always tell them,
"Commitment."

748
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:13,710
Total commitment.

749
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:21,259
So... let's go win this thing.

750
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:29,139
Whiplash in one-zero.

751
01:03:29,141 --> 01:03:30,474
Roger, Tango-45.

752
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:31,978
Whiplash in one-zero.

753
01:03:34,813 --> 01:03:35,773
Whiplash

754
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,340
Once the initial reports are in

755
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:05,635
I'll address the nation.

756
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:07,345
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

757
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:08,348
Yep.

758
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,324
Libby.

759
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,581
I knew I could count on you.

760
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:20,502
"Nuclear bombs dropped in the
base of falsified intelligence?"

761
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:26,465
These have to be published
immediately.

762
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:28,260
These go to one person first.

763
01:05:29,762 --> 01:05:31,929
They read it, they publish.

764
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,182
No, no, no, why wait?

765
01:05:35,268 --> 01:05:37,267
It's very important to me
this person is the one

766
01:05:37,269 --> 01:05:38,521
who publishes my story.

767
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,108
Who else knows?

768
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,320
On the outside?

769
01:05:46,612 --> 01:05:47,989
Just you, Martin.

770
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:01,670
Does it make you feel safe?

771
01:06:03,253 --> 01:06:04,297
No.

772
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:17,101
We should go out the back.

773
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:22,688
There are elements
within the White House

774
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:24,691
an intelligence committee

775
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:26,566
who will use every resource
at their disposal

776
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:29,112
to make sure these never see
the light of day.

777
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:31,032
What? So you're saying
that's who's outside right now?

778
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:39,456
The basement.
I've got a way out.

779
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:55,597
Hold up here for a minute.

780
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:07,193
I have nothing on me.

781
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:09,237
Um..

782
01:07:11,155 --> 01:07:13,447
I've got a student ID

783
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:15,532
about 65 bucks, a credit card,

784
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:17,534
and about 4.50 in change.

785
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:18,579
Your phone.

786
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,456
- Oh, shit.
- Leave it here.

787
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,706
Let's go.

788
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:33,300
Should we go to the cops or,
or FBI?

789
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:34,846
I mean, everyone
can't be involved, right?

790
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,391
This way.

791
01:07:41,393 --> 01:07:42,434
Why?

792
01:07:42,436 --> 01:07:43,978
The trees complicate

793
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,771
satellite and drone
surveillance.

794
01:07:45,773 --> 01:07:48,066
Low-tech can beat high-tech.

795
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:50,360
Looking at it from their end,
this needs to be a limited op.

796
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:52,235
Surgical.
Exposure can't be risked.

797
01:07:52,237 --> 01:07:54,322
Questions can't be asked.

798
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:56,240
A snatch-and-grab
on these streets in this town

799
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:57,577
would be a last resort.

800
01:07:59,286 --> 01:08:01,162
So, hide in plain sight?

801
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,290
As best as we can.

802
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:04,751
We'll need money.

803
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:13,048
This trouble you're in, you
can't tell me any more about it?

804
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,050
No.

805
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:15,092
What, for, like, my protection

806
01:08:15,094 --> 01:08:16,179
or something?

807
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:20,098
Really?

808
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,767
I'm trying to right a wrong.

809
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:25,480
If it wasn't important, really
important, I wouldn't be here.

810
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:29,234
Shit, Martin.
You realize how bizarre this is?

811
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:30,944
Please?

812
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:37,281
How much do you need?

813
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:38,576
Four hundred dollars.

814
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:42,538
Um, yes, I can get that.

815
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,040
Thank you, Jordan, okay?
T... thank you.

816
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:49,669
Uh, could you also swing
by the room and get my laptop?

817
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:50,711
Yeah.

818
01:08:50,713 --> 01:08:52,295
Maybe grab a sweater?

819
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:53,880
Yeah. Anything else
while we're at it?

820
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:55,258
That's it. Promise.

821
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,800
I take it you need all this
as soon as...

822
01:08:56,802 --> 01:08:58,262
Right now works best, actually.

823
01:09:01,056 --> 01:09:04,933
Whatever it is
you're doing here..

824
01:09:04,935 --> 01:09:06,228
...I hope it works out okay.

825
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:10,649
Be safe.

826
01:09:35,675 --> 01:09:38,092
How do you know to get in
and out like this?

827
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:39,718
I make it my business to know
every exit

828
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,013
of every building
I step foot in.

829
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:43,680
You never know
when some dickhead

830
01:09:43,682 --> 01:09:45,849
with a gun might open up.

831
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:47,811
I used to think
I was just being paranoid.

832
01:09:59,823 --> 01:10:01,367
I gotta show you something.

833
01:10:27,976 --> 01:10:30,894
What we're seeing..

834
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:31,898
...is it now?

835
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:33,983
No, yesterday.

836
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:47,745
This is this morning.

837
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:49,289
We leave, they enter.

838
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:11,768
Oh, shit.

839
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:15,232
No, don't.

840
01:11:16,775 --> 01:11:18,442
Door's open.

841
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:19,861
Hey, are you guys finished
in here

842
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,240
'cause we reserved the room,
so..

843
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,325
Yep.

844
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:27,785
Can you give us a minute?

845
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:29,204
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

846
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:31,875
Take your time. Thanks.

847
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,211
Any ideas?

848
01:11:38,213 --> 01:11:40,089
- Regarding?
- Where to go.

849
01:11:40,091 --> 01:11:41,965
Where to hide until morning.

850
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:43,302
Uh, yeah, I've got one.

851
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,975
We're taking the story
to your father, right?

852
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:52,144
Yes.

853
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,980
He runs a newspaper downstate.

854
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:58,818
He's the editor, yes.

855
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:05,740
- What if he won't print it?
- He'll print it, Martin.

856
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:07,827
Okay, but, like,
what if he can't?

857
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,378
Honestly, I've..

858
01:12:17,962 --> 01:12:20,213
I've been thinking about just

859
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:21,966
grabbing the backpack
and running.

860
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,595
Dumping the story.
Just getting it out.

861
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:27,680
You've had opportunity.

862
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,723
What's been stopping you?

863
01:12:31,725 --> 01:12:34,645
Because it's your story
and I respect that.

864
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:44,029
Your father, what's he like?

865
01:12:46,573 --> 01:12:47,991
He's a good man.

866
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:53,414
Honest... and caring.

867
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,127
It's what you want a dad to be.

868
01:13:01,296 --> 01:13:02,214
Yours?

869
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:09,556
He was all that.

870
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:18,939
He was there the 19th of June..

871
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:24,820
...visiting his mother
and father.

872
01:13:27,823 --> 01:13:29,199
Dutiful son.

873
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,162
This never ends.

874
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:39,294
Do you believe
in the hereafter?

875
01:13:40,252 --> 01:13:41,587
Heaven? No.

876
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:43,672
I do.

877
01:13:46,216 --> 01:13:48,594
And I know I'm gonna have to
answer for what I've done.

878
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:55,433
Martin... maybe you should go.

879
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:58,021
Either I get to Springfield
tomorrow or I don't.

880
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,940
But I have a chance,
thanks to you.

881
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:06,154
My father's dead.

882
01:14:08,864 --> 01:14:11,156
Well, my mother

883
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:13,161
she may as well be.
She never recovered.

884
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:17,582
These pages
are important to you?

885
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:23,378
Well, they're important
to me too.

886
01:15:48,797 --> 01:15:50,007
Dr. Lamm?

887
01:17:11,588 --> 01:17:12,716
Hello, Libby.

888
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,469
Madam President.

889
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:41,116
I apologize.

890
01:17:41,118 --> 01:17:43,496
I think the team
got a little overzealous.

891
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:47,165
And, gentlemen,
if you will excuse me

892
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:48,918
I'd like a moment alone
with Elizabeth.

893
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,295
Oh, come on, Adrian,
it'll be fine.

894
01:17:53,297 --> 01:17:55,215
Gentlemen, please. Go.

895
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:14,483
Libby, I hope my just being here
will convince you

896
01:18:14,485 --> 01:18:16,277
that what I'm about to say
is the truth

897
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:18,362
and it comes from my heart.

898
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:21,491
Despite all that's happened
and all that's been said

899
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:25,202
I still consider you a friend,
a dear friend.

900
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:28,873
You served me and this country
brilliantly.

901
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,416
A service
that I believe deserves

902
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:34,003
to be recognized and honored.

903
01:18:34,005 --> 01:18:35,838
I was at a party recently

904
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,508
and somebody reminded me
of the number.

905
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,759
Do you remember the number,
Madam President?

906
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:41,970
Of course I do.

907
01:18:43,972 --> 01:18:45,225
A hundred and fifty.

908
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,934
One hundred and fifty thousand
people

909
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:50,229
died in Homs that night.

910
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:52,856
I will always remember
that number.

911
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:55,567
You know the story, Libby.

912
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:58,652
General Sherman
in the Civil War.

913
01:18:58,654 --> 01:19:01,615
Mayor of Atlanta pleads
with him to save his city.

914
01:19:03,201 --> 01:19:04,491
And the general
says to the mayor

915
01:19:04,493 --> 01:19:07,913
just before he torches it,
"War is cruel."

916
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,834
War is cruelty.

917
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:15,669
We were at war and we did
what needed to be done

918
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:18,548
and our country is safer for it.

919
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,049
The stars aligned.

920
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:22,429
We slayed the dragon and we won.

921
01:19:24,555 --> 01:19:27,264
If there is any victory here

922
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:28,893
it has fallen on us.

923
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:33,062
Libby, I offered you
the position

924
01:19:33,064 --> 01:19:35,106
of Secretary of State
four years ago

925
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:37,442
and I am offering it
to you again.

926
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:40,363
Madam President, respectfully..

927
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:43,281
...we ginned up the evidence

928
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:46,828
and 150,000 innocent people
were vaporized.

929
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:52,375
Okay, so help me understand it.

930
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:56,544
You were fine
with drone strikes.

931
01:19:56,546 --> 01:20:00,089
Five innocents here,
ten innocents there.

932
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:01,926
What's the humane number?

933
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:04,762
A hundred?

934
01:20:06,221 --> 01:20:07,514
A thousand?

935
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,643
Ten thousand?

936
01:20:12,311 --> 01:20:13,979
Where do you draw the line?

937
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:19,319
That bomb was dropped
on a lie.

938
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:24,323
I just can't
live with that anymore.

939
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:33,041
Tell me about your manuscript.

940
01:21:20,421 --> 01:21:22,213
And the young man.

941
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:24,382
He's a good-looking boy.

942
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:26,467
How's he involved?

943
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:29,221
He's not.
Leave him be.

944
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,399
And the cameras in your house.

945
01:21:41,734 --> 01:21:44,237
- What's that about?
- None of your business.

946
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:18,268
I think I'm beginning
to understand your dilemma.

947
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,276
My dilemma?

948
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:29,196
Libby, you're this close
to being charged

949
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:31,449
with sedition and treason.

950
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,036
You don't know if
there's a copy.

951
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:38,790
And the obvious move would be to
grab Martin when you grabbed me.

952
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:41,378
He might be on the other side
of that wall this very moment.

953
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:45,295
That's the obvious move.

954
01:22:45,297 --> 01:22:47,005
That's not the Rachel Burke
I know.

955
01:22:47,007 --> 01:22:50,009
No? So, what's
the other response, then?

956
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,469
Follow the money.

957
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:55,682
Follow the boy to see
if he leads you to that copy.

958
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:57,683
The obvious downside
to that approach

959
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:59,268
is the more time allowed

960
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:00,644
the greater the opportunity

961
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:02,690
for unfortunate mischief.

962
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:12,908
I'm sure Adrian voiced
that concern.

963
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:16,662
You are a unique talent,
Libby.

964
01:23:18,997 --> 01:23:21,624
Unfortunately..

965
01:23:21,626 --> 01:23:23,418
...I don't see a very
happy ending

966
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,919
for Martin Salhi

967
01:23:25,921 --> 01:23:29,339
in either scenario
unless you tell me right now

968
01:23:29,341 --> 01:23:32,093
if there's a copy
and where I can find it.

969
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:35,804
And then, you and I
can come to an understanding

970
01:23:35,806 --> 01:23:37,516
and you can just fade away.

971
01:23:42,021 --> 01:23:44,897
All I can tell you is
what I know.

972
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:47,275
There's the original.

973
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:50,861
A dozen notepads of material
written in longhand.

974
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:53,238
There is not a single copy.

975
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,868
No hard copy,
nor electronic.

976
01:23:58,662 --> 01:24:00,122
Leave Martin be.

977
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:03,501
He is an innocent.

978
01:24:05,377 --> 01:24:06,795
Please, Rachel.

979
01:24:08,088 --> 01:24:09,673
Do with me what you will..

980
01:24:12,551 --> 01:24:13,886
...but let him be.

981
01:24:15,721 --> 01:24:17,139
How could you do this?

982
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:21,308
You had regret.
You wanted out.

983
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:24,269
I agreed to everything.

984
01:24:24,271 --> 01:24:26,147
Everything!

985
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:29,736
But for you to go
and write this betrayal?

986
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:37,075
'Cause that's exactly what
it is. It is a betrayal.

987
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:38,369
A betrayal for you.

988
01:24:40,287 --> 01:24:41,622
A reckoning for me.

989
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:50,629
Madam President, you are needed.

990
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:51,715
What is it?

991
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,095
There is a problem,
we should go.

992
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,368
I had to try.
I mean, I owe her that much.

993
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:24,205
Alright.
So, tell me about Salhi.

994
01:25:24,207 --> 01:25:26,292
Well, they lost him
in Union Station.

995
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:30,460
Thirty seconds of confusion
is about all it took.

996
01:25:30,462 --> 01:25:33,296
- How is that even possible?
- He's a smart kid.

997
01:25:33,298 --> 01:25:36,718
He found the tracker and stashed
it along with his laptop

998
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,178
in a bag on a bus
headed to Des Moines.

999
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:41,304
I know we thought the boy
would lead us to other copies

1000
01:25:41,306 --> 01:25:43,143
but leaving the backpack
was a mistake.

1001
01:25:44,476 --> 01:25:47,812
We did go back and check
the security videos.

1002
01:25:47,814 --> 01:25:51,273
Salhi purchased a bus ticket
to Springfield

1003
01:25:51,275 --> 01:25:52,943
and we have him boarding
that bus.

1004
01:25:54,612 --> 01:25:56,111
- Pull your team.
- That would be a mistake.

1005
01:25:56,113 --> 01:25:57,487
The operation is blown.

1006
01:25:57,489 --> 01:25:59,240
The pads are in a backpack,
which can be easily

1007
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:00,282
taken when the bus arrives.

1008
01:26:00,284 --> 01:26:01,742
It'll look like
a simple mugging.

1009
01:26:01,744 --> 01:26:03,619
No. It's already light
in the Midwest.

1010
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:05,287
No. It's too risky. No.

1011
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:07,080
Madam President,
there are people that don't

1012
01:26:07,082 --> 01:26:08,835
want that document
made public, ever.

1013
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,503
Like yourself.

1014
01:26:15,632 --> 01:26:18,425
There will be no second term.
You will be disgraced.

1015
01:26:18,427 --> 01:26:22,347
I will take my chances
with the American people.

1016
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:26,558
They remember
what it was like before Homs.

1017
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,727
They remember the fear.

1018
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:29,269
Impeachment,
followed by conviction.

1019
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:30,812
- Oh, it's not gonna happen.
- I don't think...

1020
01:26:30,814 --> 01:26:33,566
Look, Adrian,
you work for me now.

1021
01:26:33,568 --> 01:26:36,361
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

1022
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:39,988
The agency can more than handle
its own affairs.

1023
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:43,036
Commission-proof intel
is the phrase I remember.

1024
01:26:45,872 --> 01:26:48,291
- This is dangerous.
- Oh, we'll weather it. Stop it.

1025
01:26:51,543 --> 01:26:53,046
What should we do with the boy?

1026
01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:57,050
Let him go.
I mean, he's the messenger.

1027
01:26:58,885 --> 01:27:00,302
And Libby?

1028
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:04,473
Take her home.

1029
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,603
It'll be her word against ours.

1030
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:21,321
The American people won't
want to refight a war

1031
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:22,741
that's already won.

1032
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:36,981
Did Adrian fly in
with you guys?

1033
01:28:36,983 --> 01:28:39,485
No. He stayed in California.

1034
01:29:06,011 --> 01:29:09,263
Dr. Lamm, when your feet
touch that ground

1035
01:29:09,265 --> 01:29:11,516
start walking and count to 20.

1036
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:14,852
Only then remove the hood.
Understood?

1037
01:29:14,854 --> 01:29:18,606
Yes.

1038
01:29:50,097 --> 01:29:52,809
I'm... I'm Martin Salhi.
I'm here to see Phillip Lamm.

1039
01:29:55,895 --> 01:29:57,562
You can say it's regarding
his daughter, Elizabeth.

1040
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:58,898
Let me try him.

1041
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:04,485
Hey, Blair, would you

1042
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:06,028
let Phil know that Martin..

1043
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:07,237
Salhi.

1044
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:09,490
There's a Martin Salhi here
to see him.

1045
01:30:15,748 --> 01:30:17,080
He's on his way down.

1046
01:30:29,887 --> 01:30:31,219
Martin!

1047
01:30:31,221 --> 01:30:33,097
- What the fuck happened to you?
- You have to leave.

1048
01:30:33,099 --> 01:30:34,976
What? Hey, what..

1049
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:39,271
Daddy.

1050
01:30:40,314 --> 01:30:41,813
Oh, no.

1051
01:31:06,716 --> 01:31:08,885
- Where is she?
- On the phone with the FBI.

1052
01:31:19,061 --> 01:31:20,104
Okay, Fred.

1053
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,564
Yes, she was.

1054
01:31:23,733 --> 01:31:26,983
Thanks.
Just keep me posted.

1055
01:31:26,985 --> 01:31:29,070
You know, about everything.

1056
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:30,532
Okay, thanks.

1057
01:31:44,962 --> 01:31:46,046
Get out.

1058
01:31:47,423 --> 01:31:50,090
Just putting the period
on the sentence.

1059
01:31:50,092 --> 01:31:51,802
I said, get out.

1060
01:31:56,099 --> 01:31:58,184
Of course,
she was a dear friend.

1061
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:01,688
I'll make that clear
in the statement.

1062
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:11,528
As of now, there are
23 confirmed dead.

1063
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:13,447
Among those,
Elizabeth Lamm

1064
01:32:13,449 --> 01:32:15,532
former National Security
Affairs Advisor

1065
01:32:15,534 --> 01:32:17,035
to then,
Vice President Burke

1066
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:18,660
and her father,
Phillip Lamm

1067
01:32:18,662 --> 01:32:21,039
executive editor of
the Springfield Register

1068
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:22,415
the site of the attack.

1069
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:28,379
We are learning the FBI
now believes

1070
01:32:28,381 --> 01:32:30,798
that the primary suspect,
Martin Salhi

1071
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,759
acted alone and specifically
targeted Dr. Lamm

1072
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:36,219
for her role in
the controversial strike

1073
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:38,222
on Homs, Syria,
four years ago.

1074
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:40,599
Mr. Salhi had family in Homs.

1075
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:43,227
Dr. Lamm, known as
the architect of recent

1076
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:45,228
US policy in the war
on terror

1077
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:49,025
advocated what came to be known
as Total Victory.

1078
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:51,568
President Burke has been
on the West Coast this week

1079
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:53,528
attending various
fundraising events.

1080
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,072
She is in San Francisco
this afternoon

1081
01:32:56,408 --> 01:32:58,534
...Adrian Little,
the President's chief of staff

1082
01:32:58,536 --> 01:33:00,745
issued this statement
concerning the attack.

1083
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:02,871
Good afternoon, everyone.

1084
01:33:02,873 --> 01:33:05,833
President Burke is both
saddened and stunned

1085
01:33:05,835 --> 01:33:10,129
as we all are,
by this vicious act of terror

1086
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:13,802
and the death of our colleague
and good friend, Elizabeth Lamm.

1087
01:33:15,552 --> 01:33:16,512
Jordan Ritt?

1088
01:33:17,805 --> 01:33:18,972
FBI.

1089
01:33:21,266 --> 01:33:24,811
Look, Martin wasn't
the easiest person in the world

1090
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:26,437
to get along with, for sure

1091
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:29,234
but this just makes no sense.

1092
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:34,528
If what you're asking is,
do I think Martin was capable of

1093
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:37,365
blowing himself up,
murdering dozens of people

1094
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:38,534
my answer is no.

1095
01:33:39,828 --> 01:33:41,121
I don't believe that.

1096
01:33:56,677 --> 01:33:58,969
This is my apartment.

1097
01:33:58,971 --> 01:34:00,222
Nobody told you?

1098
01:34:59,532 --> 01:35:02,616
Excellent conversation,
if I do say so myself.

1099
01:35:02,618 --> 01:35:05,662
- Congratulations on that.
- Yes, it is a fine art.
