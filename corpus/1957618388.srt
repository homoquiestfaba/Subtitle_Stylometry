 ONLY THIS TIME,

2073
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:42,710
THE GREAT OUTDOORS--

2074
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,749
 SHE IS DEAD!

2075
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,453
 --IS ABOUT TO CLOSE IN.

2076
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,420
 WE GOT TO GET THAT CAMERA.

2077
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,288
WE GOT TO GET THE TAPE.

2078
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,289
DO YOU HEAR ME?

2079
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:56,858
 AND AS THE WOODS GET DEEPER--

2080
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,493
 SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.

2081
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:00,929
 --THE DANGER GETS DEADLIER.

2082
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,797
 WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE GUN?

2083
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,366
 YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS,

2084
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,302
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

2085
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:10,138
 NOW, A CHAMPION WHO NEVER

2086
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:12,440
LOST FACES AN ENEMY

2087
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,976
WHO'S NOT PLAYING GAMES.

2088
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:15,944
 TOUGH GAL, HUH?

2089
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,545
I LIKE TOUGH.

2090
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,080
 CHAMPIONS USE

2091
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,448
WHAT THEY KNOW TO WIN.

2092
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,584
 THE RULES ARE SIMPLE:

2093
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,152
YOU WIN, YOU LIVE.

2094
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:27,922
YOU LOSE, YOU DIE.

2095
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,626
 RIGHT HERE AND SMILE.

2096
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:32,727
[ GUNSHOT ]

2097
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:33,394
 AH!

2098
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:34,062
 IF WE DON'T

2099
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:34,729
GET TO HIM ON TIME,

2100
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:35,463
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL THEM.

2101
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,499
 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MERCY,

2102
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:41,002
LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

2103
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:41,936
 YOU AIN'T GOING

2104
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,171
TO LIKE WHAT'S COMING NEXT.

2105
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,473
 I'M GOING TO KICK HIS BUTT.

2106
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,041
 BECAUSE MIMI BELIEVES

2107
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:50,178
IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS, LEFTS,

2108
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:52,180
AND UPPERCUTS.

2109
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:00,622
MAGNIFICENT MIMI LESSEOS

2110
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:04,492
IS BEYOND FEAR.
