1
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,060
Woman, woman, woman...a man's got to have at least one.

2
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:06,740
I've had many, but now my lust for conquest, freedom and adventure has given

3
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:15,350
way to my true sense of responsibility. I
want and I need a woman for me. To be

4
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,870
mother to my kids, someone to grow old
with, my mate for life.

5
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:30,950
Incredible, out of all the woman I've bedded, me inside of them becoming one. Making

6
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,760
the creature with two backs . The most
sacred act two people can carry out.

7
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:47,140
It was so wrong and yet so right, and still
I am alone.

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,180
womanless, aimlessly hustling the streets.

9
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,600
Woman, woman, woman...

10
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,840
sure I could find a quick piece,
that's easy, there is a time in every

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,410
man's life when casual and shallow sex
is no longer sought after. I want real

12
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,549
intimacy and affection and to get it I'll
walk these cold, miserable, godforsaken

13
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:27,959
streets until I find her. She must be a
friend, a lover and yes sometimes even a

14
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,829
mother and it's a two-way street.
I will nurture her with my love. I will

15
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:41,670
make her happy when she is sad. I will
heal her when she is sick. I will cook

16
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,580
for her when she is hungry.
I will dedicate my life to understanding,

17
00:02:47,580 --> 00:03:01,560
sacrificing and respecting her and her
alone, and in return all I want is her love.

18
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:11,890
Her unrestrained, unconditional love. Dammit there's some one for everyone and I'm

19
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:20,360
on a hunt to find the huntress. That
some one from me!

20
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,070
Hey Harold! What's up sugar?

21
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:42,889
Look like you got something on your mind baby, cuz I damn sure got pain on mine. Ooh, my damn feet hurt

22
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:49,370
shit. Was a time when things was
jumping out here but them damn crackheads

23
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,900
then came out here and messed up
everything and I'll be damned if I'm

24
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,520
gonna sell my ass for a lousy two
dollars. I wouldn't let a nigga smell it

25
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,060
for that! Huh!

26
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:12,030
cuz I got class! Look at Woodpecker. Make me sick to my stomach just to look at him.

27
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,240
Eating out of garbage like he ain't never had no kind of home training or nothing.

28
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,360
But he shows a good lookout, see all kind
of shit up in that tree. Last Thursday

29
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,970
night I did this trick in his car and he
tried to get funny with my money. I said

30
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,510
wait a minute nigga that's my man up in
that tree he don't want no shit tonight.

31
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:42,950
He saw woodpecker sitting in that tree, he liked to shit on his self.

32
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:51,680
Paid me my money and gave me a tip. When me and you gonna do a little somethin' Harold?

33
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,950
Huh, you and me will have a good time baby cuz this some good red pussy.

34
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Ooh! 'bout time!

35
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,230

Two dollar crackhead hoes, damn my feet and they hurtin', Ooh my goodness and she had the

39
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,740
Stop! Stop!

40
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,900
He was too!

41
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,400
He wasn't!

42
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,100
He was too!

43
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,400
You talkin' bout' the one that got away...

44
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Ray Robinson was best welter weight to step inside of a ring.

45
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,400
You gots to be crazy! Ray Leonard will walk all over Ray Robinson's ass and forget to jump off.

46
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,400
I'll tell you who was a bad ass now. Sweet Pretty Pete Jackson. Pretty Pete kick all that ass yawl talkin' 'bout.

47
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
The Pretty Pete Sweep!

48
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
What ever happened to him?

49
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Panties, garters, brassieres and slips? I sell them wholesale and I know they'll fit...

50
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,000
I heard he moved out of the country.

51
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,400
I heard he killed himself playing Russian Roulette.

52
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Got anymore of the lace thongs Harold?

53
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,423
Give me one of them Leapord skin brassieres in a 38D sweet heart.

54
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Me too Harold, but I need a 32 A...I mean, it's still a mouth full.

55
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
For who's mouth?

56
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
No you didn't...no you didn't.

57
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes I did...

58
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You get those crotchless black panties for me?

59
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,900
Got 'em right here.

60
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,930
Well listen now, slip 'em to me on the sly. What I wear under my clothes is my business.

61
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,078
Something wrong?

62
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,820
Harold, how come you don't trim some of that beard off of your face?

63
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,180
Your mouth look just like Wolf pussy!

64
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,180
You really think so?

65
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
I know so.

66
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,244
But I thought this is the kind of thing that the ladies like.

67
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:18,800
Look at your mouth. Man, cut that hair off of your face.

68
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,700
But this is a good trim...maybe...I don't know...

69
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
It look nasty! That's what it look.

70
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,100
Nasty?

71
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,460
Nasty! Cut that stuff off of your face.

72
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:29,960
Nasty!

73
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,520
How nasty?

74
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
Real nasty!

75
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,300
But it don't look like no wolf pussy.

76
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,100
I'll tell you one thing. You may not be able to cut the mustard, but you can't even lick the lid with all that on your mouth.

77
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,680
I'll think about it...

78
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,180
You need to.

79
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,460
Child! Your mama ain't told you that yet?

80
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:57,020
Now ain't this a bitch? Oh forgive me, this is a mother fucker. Miss prim and proper buys her under panties on the sneak tip!

81
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
I bet she buys crotchless!

82
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:11,000
Shit! If the nigga to tired to pull 'em down then the hell with him honey...

83
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,340
Hey, It would take one hell of a fishermen to pull down them under patties.

84
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,800
Kiss my double black ass Rumpadoo!

85
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,420
...and when you finish with hers you can start on mine.

86
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,700
The both of you could kiss my bumpy,
lumpy black ass!

87
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,200
Everybody in here can kiss my pretty black ass!

88
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,870
All right Floreen, you can kiss my ass too!

89
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,620
You're wrong Rumpadoo.

90
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,000
Well you can kiss my black ass too Hubcap!

91
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You kiss my ass!

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yawl can kiss my...

93
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,500
You ain't got that much to be passing
around for someone to kiss.

94
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No he didn't...no he didn't!

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes he did! Yes he did! Yes he did!

96
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,400
Okay, here's to no ass!

97
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,600
I just got off from work and came in here for a drink man. What kind of a joint is this?

98
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,460
Terrible

99
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,360
No ass!

100
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,360
This is he first time that I ever saw a woman like that in a place like this.

101
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
You's a 'bout a bad bitch.

102
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,180
Will you leave me the hell alone!

103
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,620
Aw right.

104
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,400
Her name is Maria.

105
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Yeah, niggers been hitting on her all night.

106
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Just like flies!

107
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,700
Yeah and she been swatting them away as fast as they come.

108
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,080
You feel lucky?

109
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,220
I think I do.

110
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,220
She sure is good looking.

111
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,000
Gosh she's beautiful.

112
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
I ain't gonna argue with you about that.

113
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,820
She's turning on the town.

114
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,080
I think she is.

115
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,240
You better get moving before you get crowded out man.

116
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,280
You going over there, you going over there?

117
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,600
If yawl give me a chance to get one
thing in, I'm gonna try my luck. You never know.

118
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800
You better get there before the heard comes.

119
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,490
Harold! Let me lay something on you.

120
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,170
Slip this under your hat.

121
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,100
That's right.

122
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,180
Panties, garters, brassieres and slips. I
sell them wholesale and I know they'll fit.

123
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,100
Extra tall, extra large, medium and small,
don't worry about the color cuz I got them all.

124
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,660
No thank you.

125
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
How about a nice
half cotton slip?

126
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I don't wear slips.

127
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,560
I got some really nice--

128
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,860
--Nor panties.

129
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,080
You don't have any panties on?

130
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
No.

131
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,860
Then, how about some a-a-a sheer stockings?

132
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,500
Look if I buy your goddamn stockings will you

133
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,340
leave me the hell alone?

134
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,000
Sure, sure um what size do you wear?

135
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,560
I don't know you'll have to fit me?

136
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,680
You want me to fit you? You want me to put the stockings on you here?

137
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,180
Sure, why not?

138
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,040
Okay.

139
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,240
I think this is far enough.

140
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,780
I don't.

141
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,500
I want you more than I've ever wanted a
woman in my life.

142
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,360
I wanna make love to you all night long.

143
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,680
There's something I have to tell you first.

144
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:15,120
We've already wasted enough time talking,
I want you now.

145
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,160
Hi baby

146
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Do you love me?

147
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Hey baby!

148
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,380
Do you love me?

149
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Hey, I need you so bad...

150
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
So bad...

151
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Oh yes, take me!

152
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,280
No!

153
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,150
What's wrong?

154
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,686
Not yet!

155
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,360
What do you mean
not yet?

156
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,280
I want to make love to you.

157
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,660
I need you to
do something for me.

158
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,240
Oh baby I want you now.

159
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
I want this to be right.

160
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,380
Oh come on I need you now.

161
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,920
I want you to do something for me.

162
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:47,529
What do you want me to do?

163
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,460
I want you to go into the bathroom while I get ready for you.

164
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,740
Into the bathroom?

165
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,940
For what?

166
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,460
Because I want this to be right for us.

167
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,580
It'll be right, I promise. C'mon...

168
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Harold, do this for me?

169
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,120
Into the bathroom?

170
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,440
Please.

171
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,760
I want it to be right for us.

172
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,920
Okay

173
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,480
Okay, okay no tricks I'll be right back.

174
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Harold.

175
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,080
Get naked.

176
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:51,860
This is so perfect, so right and she is
so good-looking, she's actually out there

177
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:57,960
getting ready for me, good sign,
she's obedient and courteous. I love the

178
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,800
way she smells
walks and talks. She is walking grace.

179
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,200
she's brave, kind, friendly, what more could a guy ask for?

180
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,120
Oh Harold you can come in now.

181
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Thank you God, thank you God!

182
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,920
Oh Jesus...what have I done!?

183
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,860
You forget these?

184
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,720
You out and take off my robe, take off my
robe!

185
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,120
Nevermind, keep it, keep it on, pull it up, pull it up, turn around

186
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,800
and don't peek.

187
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,640
I don't believe this, I hope my mother never
find out about this. We shouldn't be

188
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,680
trying to do nothing nothing, we can't do
nothing.

189
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,440
What kind of thing are you?

190
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,500
Sweetheart, I'm a good thing.

191
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,940
Oh my God!

192
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,460
Oh...oh...

193
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,080
oh...my head...

194
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,940
So how do you want your coffee?

195
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Coffee?

196
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,620
My...my, Oh...I rebember. You hit me.
Aw don't nobody hit me.

197
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,100
You threw the first lick.

198
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,320
I ain't going out like that,
no way!

199
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,560
Have it your way.

200
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,220
Ah forget it.

201
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,600
I take my coffee black with the three
sugars.

202
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,940
Forget it...

203
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,900
Oh...

204
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,680
Where did you ever learn to hit like that?

205
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,460
I used to box out of Paterson under the name of

206
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
Pretty Pete Jackson.

207
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,640
Pretty Pete Jackson...Sweet Pretty Pete Jackson?

208
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,659
I saw everyone of your fights! Man you
were good, you could have been champ.

209
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:24,970
you could have been a contender, wait a
minute hold the presses, wait one second I've

210
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,229
got something right here. I collect these
at all the fights, check this out check

211
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:41,180
check it out, let's see here, I got Hagler, Tyson, Foreman, Holyfield, Archie Moore, Joe Louis, Ali...

212
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,100
Sweet Pretty Pete...

213
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,760
You really are Sweet Pretty Pete.

214
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
Sweet Pretty Pete!

215
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,600
What happened?

216
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,740
I came to the realization
that I was a woman

217
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,280
trapped inside a man's body.

218
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,140
I don't normally go to bars and pick up
strange men, I was just a little upset

219
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,260
with my boyfriend

220
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:32,309
just last week I caught Alan in the bed
with my best friend

221
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,419
and what's so funny
I would take him back

222
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,679
but I think they're together

223
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,480
loneliness...Oh God.

224
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:59,910
loneliness can be such an awful thing.
I need someone to love someone to come

225
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,550
home to someone to care for

226
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,380
if you weren't a man--

227
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,980
--I'd better go I
better go, but before I do I have

228
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
something for you

229
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,200
Wait a second don't
don't do it don't do this to yourself--

230
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:27,160
Relax, I have a girlfriend. Her name is
Sally. She's a very nice girl, a lot like me.

231
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,360
How much is this Sally like you?

232
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
She's very much a woman.

233
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,400
Harold
I was wondering

234
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,720
if it's not too much to ask

235
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,940
could you hold me before I go

236
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,309
Okay come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... let's do it.

237
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,780
Hello Sally

238
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,900
this is a great place you
have here. It's so isolated from everything

239
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,760
It helps with my writing and you
don't have to lock your doors

240
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,620
oh so you write, what kind of stuff?

241
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,460
I write primarily for children I'm working

242
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,460
on my tenth publication

243
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,224
interesting

244
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:37,429
I love children. Do you have any?

245
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,960
No

246
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:47,160
I don't. have any kids. I've been very careful where I plant my seeds.

247
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,180
So how do you know Maria?

248
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:00,510
I met her on a plane out of
Miami. We sat together. I was so impressed

249
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,510
with her commitment to find her soul
mate. She invited me over to her place

250
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:14,060
once we got back to New York, we stayed
up half the night girl talking

251
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,840
soon I found myself confiding in her

252
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:31,740
Harold, I never been with a man, the mere thought of it brings on a fear so deep

253
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,358
I can't spread my wings.

254
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:39,460
I think you're making this a lot more complicated than what it is

255
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,180
Have you ever heard of the Tuskegee
study?

256
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,440
The syphilis study done somewhere in the south?

257
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:54,980
Macon County Alabama, that's
where I'm from. The government called it

258
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,900
an experiment where 600 black men over
40 year period were used as human guinea pigs

259
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:07,460
for a syphilis study. My daddy was one
of those guinea

260
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:17,880
It was hell coming up with daddy. He tormented me to his last days.

261
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:27,940
My mother couldn't take so she left, it was just me and daddy. A week didn't go by that he didn't

262
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,230
neglect warning me about what happens to
fornicators, oftentimes exposing me to

263
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:41,889
the syphilitic lesions that ate away at
his body. One afternoon I was coming from

264
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:50,499
school with a classmate of mine. Boy's name was Johnny Brown. He was holding my hand

265
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:55,769
it was completely innocent

266
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:00,510
daddy saw us

267
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,570
I was tied up

268
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,130
called a whore

269
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,140
and whipped like an animal

270
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,880
My god!

271
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:30,180
that's when the whippings began. I was 11 years old they continued for years until

272
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,680
he was too weak to administer them

273
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,120
finally daddy died

274
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm sorry

275
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,620
my daddy had one indiscretion in his life

276
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:49,080
that is how he thought he contracted the disease, when all along it was the government

277
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,370
who inoculated him with it

278
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:00,830
syphilis spread to his brain causing his
insanity so it really wasn't his fault

279
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,200
still every time I think about getting
close to a man, I hear daddy's warning

280
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:15,330
coming from the grave. Maria must have
had some real special reason for giving

281
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,700
you my number. I mean we really
identified with one another

282
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,740
Well actually so did she and I.

283
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,140
So can I see you tomorrow for dinner?

284
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,400
Haven't you been listening to me? I have a man phobia

285
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,260
It's okay, I understand.

286
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,440
Get your hands off me--

287
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,960
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

288
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:09,180
I'm sorry I don't really laughs you are
so cute

289
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,980
tea's ready

290
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
How many sugars do you take?

291
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,920
Two

292
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,400
ah thank you

293
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:59,680
these are for you

294
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,542
thank you...they're beautiful

295
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,679
I've been calling you every day

296
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,489
I know

297
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:08,289
I got all of your messages

298
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:11,140
I didn't mean to pass out on our first date.

299
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,127
for some reason I just got so sleepy

300
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,629
that's not why I hadn't returned your calls

301
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,920
actually I like hearing the sound of
your voice

302
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,820
I just wanted to see if you were really
interested in me

303
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,780
of course I am

304
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,680
see now I feel guilty. Will you forgive me?

305
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,200
there's nothing to forgive

306
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,500
I made some cookies...come on

307
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,700
I want to fly

308
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,007
you know, we should be using condoms

309
00:35:57,007 --> 00:36:00,380
you have nothing to worry about

310
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm on the pill

311
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,620
Oh Oh...

312
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,680
what's wrong?

313
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
Oh Oh...

314
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,200
you okay

315
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,560
I'm sorry

316
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,280
it's alright...we got all night

317
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,380
Oh...

318
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
oh God...

319
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,340
What's wrong?

320
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,640
Nothing.

321
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,600
I can tell when something's bothering

322
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,940
you dr. Lydia Patricia Smith.

323
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,560
How much longer?

324
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,020
It's not like I have any control over this.

325
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,200
It's been a month already.

326
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,260
I know!

327
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,720
Let's give it a few more weeks, we don't
want to lose him, he's just the right type.

328
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,220
What's that supposed to mean? You
know damn well what this is supposed to

329
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,549
mean.
We are in this together.

330
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,560
Yeah I know.
When I think about him touching you it just

331
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,010
makes me crazy!

332
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,910
I am your woman and yours alone.

333
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,600
I want it when I want it! I can't help it if 
I have a headache!

334
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,050
bullshit you men kill me!
All ways claiming you want it all the time

335
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,420
but when you're faced with a real woman
you go running for cover!

336
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,366
If the shoe was on the other foot!

337
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:18,770
If the shoe were on the other foot I would

338
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,989
not pressure you!

339
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:28,430
What kind of man are
you? I'm your woman and I want you.

340
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,100
Can't you handle your business?

341
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,440
Now you're trying to mess with my head, that won't work.

342
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,580
Then if I can't get it from you
I'll have to go elsewhere

343
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,360
You're not serious are you?

344
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,620
Of course not, I want only one man.

345
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,060
Wait wait don't take

346
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,460

347
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,660
You used to be gentle!

348
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,360
Where do you think
you're going?

349
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,960
I've got to go somewhere in sync

350
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,600
I got to get away from you!

351
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,491
You get your ass back here!

352
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:14,610
You're a freak

353
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:15,080
I'm your man and you wanted me, that is
more than any man can ask for, yes you

354
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:23,690

give you what you want, as much as you
want, as long as you want

356
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:37,370
funny, how after a fight the need to
make up is like a deep itch. I want

357
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:50,060
you so bad...oh yeah...but you're still
angry with me

358
00:40:50,060 --> 00:41:00,050

felt it like this before, I take the

359
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:06,940
blame, I take the blame, just don't reject
me like this

360
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,220
all I ask is that you give me another
chance to prove myself.

361
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,100
I promise you, I won't disappoint you

362

I feel it deep in my soul,

365
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:58,360
what I'm saying is that together, we can conquer the world

366
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,080

378
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,660
Sally is my lover we're trying to have a baby

379
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,100

380
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,131
is this true

381
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:18,806

382
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:20,569

383
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:25,970

slaughter our own chickens thank you

384
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,600
shouldn't I have had a say in this

385
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,499
give me a break! You've sewn your Wild Oats

386
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:34,819

share and now you want to stand up and be counted?

387
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:39,759

used your father

389
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,060
Oh that Tuskegee line again? Five months ago it was the Watts riot

390
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,180
Give me those feet--

391
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,360
Gospel, rock, jazz and pop. I got cassette tape with everything on it,

392
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,960
buy one tape and you’ll never, ever need another because everything is on the back of one tape...

393
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,880

400
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,280
you want to go to hotels and motels, with
somebody else's tail, when you should

402
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,520

404
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,000

00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,520
Men going with men, women going with women.

408
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,680
You can't even tell the men from the women anymore!

409
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,200
Men piercing their ears just like the women

people just go around piercing this and that!

411
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,280
You've got enough holes in your body already!

412
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,660
God gave you all the holes in your body that you need.

413

00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,440

[door bell]

448
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,960
[laughing]

449
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,340
[laughing]

450
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,620
what's wrong?

451
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,420
you are so funny, how did you find me?

452
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,160
people talk it was easy

453
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,860
what are you doing here?

454
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,088
I want to convert

455
00:49:47,088 --> 00:49:51,780
well for starters take off that ridiculous outfit

456
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,740
and get in here before my neighbor's see you

457
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,360
[laughing]

458
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,780
you look like Moses

459
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,380
So you really want to convert?

460
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,860
Yes, every man must have God

461
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,720
So why come to me?

462
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,220
why not?

463
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,200
it's time for prayer

464
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,800
You go to bed this early?

465
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,240
no, we pray five times a day

466
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,440
Five times?

467
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,380
So do you still want to convert?

468
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,100
Great tea

469
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,400
What are you doing?

470
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,566
I can't hear you

471
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:05,300
In my religion, the woman is not heard

472
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,940
and in the future once the prayer has begun don't interrupt

473
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,120
If you can't walk around here and not be proud to be Black, then there's something wrong with you.

474
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,900
is everything okay?

475
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,140

529
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,300
you're too young to be running the
streets and jumping in and out of cars

530
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,500
with strengers

531
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,840

at McDonald's. I got a hustle!

535
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:26,170
you're not as tough as you sound. These streets

536
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,490
will use you up and spit you out!

537
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:29,755
I can handle myself

538
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:30,880
yeah, I saw her you

539
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,460
handled yourself back there with Joe
horny

540
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,680
I wasn't the one bleeding

541
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,920
you were lucky this time

542
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,060
yo' man!

543
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,180
I've seen young girls like you go from
sugar to riffraff

544
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,500
Yo' man!

545
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,620
yo, my mother was

546
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,800
my age with she had me

547
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:50,860
Awight

548
00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:04,990
I remember when I was five years old
I wake up sometimes at night all alone

549
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:11,740
in a dark ass apartment, no electricity, not knowing where my mother was

550
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,580
she was running the streets mad crazy for some crack!

551
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:32,480
she's 32 now, but looks mad older. So, I seen with own eyes how the streets used up my mother

552
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,260
so don't tell me, I don't know about being used up!

553
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,780
Yo' man.

554
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,800
everyone in my family is a crack head

555
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,860
my grandmama included

556
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,340
my baby sister is 8 years old.

557
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:12,620
So I'm the one who got to supply the crack,

558
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,840
I'm the one who gotta hustle

559
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,940
You hungry?

560
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,940

Man Harold, look at me, these clothes are wack!

588
01:02:59,480 --> 01:02:59,980
You have to get an education.

589
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,580
You know this.

590
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,420
Maria, I really appreciate you going along with this

591
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,880
I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you

592
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,300
Oh don't worry. I'll think of something...

593
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,500
I can't tell you the last time I saw grades like this. Your daughter will most

594
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:46,020
certainly be an asset to our school in
fact, I will personally see to it

595
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,511
that she gets admitted immediately

596
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:49,467
thank you Father

01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:51,380

598
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:57,460
fine student, it does my heart good to
see such a fine family seated before me

599
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:06,530
why just last week a group of misguided individuals calling themselves the gay

600
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:12,400
and lesbian alliance, tried to get a court order to replace me with their

601
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,340
concoction of a homosexual priest of all things

602
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,440
Haa! How dare they father!?

603
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,200
Now dear...

604
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:24,710
No, no, no, your wife's indignation is in order. I just wish I'd met more people like

605
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,980

606
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,680

614
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:56,460
God is great, God is good. Now we thank him for this food.

615
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:04,680
Oh and God, thank you bringing Maria and Harold into my life

616
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,420

617
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,660
Harold c'mon, cut the bird. I'm starving

618
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,100
Y'all stayin' for dinner?

619
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,900
You're gonna leave

620
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,560
It seems to me that there might be a little error.

621
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:28,230
oh I mean let me have a look at it. Yeah, we all make mistakes now I guess

622
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:34,664
Yeah there is a mistake I've seen it all along. It's $5,000.

623
01:06:34,664 --> 01:06:38,340
Here you is captain, check that off

624
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,000
and tell it to the Boss.

625
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,080
Fire!

626
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:49,620
[gun fire]

627
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:52,980
Fire again!

628
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,480
Don't you all know I've got a charm!?

629
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:56,980
Hey...

630
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,187
why you do that?

631
01:06:58,187 --> 01:07:00,220
It's why did you do that?

632
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,940
All right, so why did you do that?

633
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,190
It's getting late

634
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:08,820
you have school tomorrow and besides I
have to hit the streets early.

635
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,820
Alright fine.

636
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:14,740
Okay.

637
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,600
Goodnight.

638
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,260
Emmm, love you

639
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:19,760
Love you to.

640
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,360
Goodnight babe.

641
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,800
Oh, I guess I won't be needing this anymore.

642
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,840
She really is a good girl isn't she?

643
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,920
Yeah, she is

644
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,800
I don't know how much longer

645
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,100
this masquerade can go on

646
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:57,180
but I don't want to send it back out into the streets

647
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,240
and I don't want to get you into any trouble

648
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,380
oh honey don't worry about me I'm a big girl.

649
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,540
You know, I really appreciate this.

650
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,160
I can't find my pajamas!

651
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,500
They're in the drawer on the right.

652
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,920
I better be leaving.

653
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:01,480
Mama!

654
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,860
Who the hell you think you are running out on me like that?

655
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,400
Hi Debbi.

656
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,160
Hi baby sister Rochell.

657
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:18,940
You miss me?

658
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,240
and where the hell you get these clothes from?

659
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,140
I'm back in school mama.

660
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,660
Well you bringing your ass home with me now

01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,300
No! You can't make me

662
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:39,560
If you don't she will bitch!

663
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,580
Harold, Debbi never came home from school.

664
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm worried, I'm really worried.

665
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,920
She's probably just knocking around.

666
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,760
that's all.

667
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,160
you know I lost my storage keys--

668
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,640
Harold, you don't understand. Debbie was raped

669
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,560
Yes...she was raped...

670
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,000

01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,380

673
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,320
She ain't here.

674
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,640
You ain't shit anyway.

675
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,040
Oh no you didn't.

676
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,780
I'm looking for Debbie

677
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,360
What you want with a young thing like that, when you can have the mouth of experience?

678
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,540
Huh, what you want with something like that?

679
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,700

This is where I belong.

685
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,860
Ain't this a bitch!

686
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,460

687
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,560

On and on an on...

697
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,960
I don’t mean to intimidate you at all

698
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,920
But if I don’t tell you

699
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,640
You can’t know what I want

700
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,920
Some don’t express the need

701
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,480
Cause there insecure

702
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:41,220
I don’t have that problem you can rest assure

703
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:46,780
If you want to arouse and you want to turn me on

704
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,420
Take your hands and place them where they belong

705
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,900
All over my body baby every curve and serve

706
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,380

707

Feel me--Caress my body all night long

709

Feel me--Take the time to learn my body

710
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:22,120
Feel me--Oh that’s the way to turn me on

711
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,140
If try to run before you can walk

712
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:31,220
You’re sure to stumble and fall

713
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:35,940
Either take the time to learn all my needs

714
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:41,360
Or don’t expect to satisfy me at all

715
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:46,480
If you want to arouse me and if you want to turn me on

716
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,580
Take your hands and place them where they belong

717
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:56,920
All over my sweet body baby--baby

718
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:01,080
If you want to satisfy me, then

719
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:06,360
Fell me--Oh feel my body gently baby

720
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,660
Feel me--Caress my body all night long

721
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:16,660
Feel me--Take the time to learn my body

722
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,340
Feel me--Oh that’s the way to turn me

723
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:25,010
I want to give you a piece of my
womanhood you couldn't feel in my kiss

724
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:29,420
my mind can move mountains and shapely
as my hips

725
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:34,760
I'm glad you enjoy my physical peak but
if you can't stimulate my brain then

726
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:39,230
brother you are a weak see to impress me
with material things diamond rings

727
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:41,240
what's happened to our kings and queens

728
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,980
caught wih the way one phene, to get inside of a woman's jeans

729
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,160
instead of her heart and head...

730
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:18,460
Whooo yeah...handle it!

731
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,300
Handle it!

732
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,400
Handle it!

733
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,980
Handle it!!!

734
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,240
Baby yes!

735
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,540
Handle your business baby!

736
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:39,880
Handle it!

737
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,000
Handle it!

738
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,440
Handle it!

739
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,560
Handle it!

740
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,280
Handle it!

741
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:49,820
Handle it!

742
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,440
Handle it...

743
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,060
Woodpecker?

744
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:10,560
What, what, what are you telling me? What?

745
01:20:13,929 --> 01:20:15,940
Woodpecker, Woodpecker...what are you doing?

746
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,440
Get up!

747
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,340
what are you doing?

748
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,260
Get up, what's wrong?

749
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,580
What are you doing, get up!

750
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:23,780
What's wrong!

751
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:24,820
Get up!

752
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,760
Ge up!

753
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,920
C'mon bitch!

754
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,940
What's wrong with you!!!

755
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:34,940
What!

756
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,180
What's wrong with you!!!

757
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,880
[crying]

758
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:58,280
Oh baby... it's okay baby...

759
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,360
oh it's alright baby...

760
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,260
Oh baby it's okay

761
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,500
oh baby, it's okay...

762
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:03,739
The wounds caused a partial
evisceration of the genitals resulting

763
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:12,110
in a major loss of blood. Right now he's
in guarded but stable condition. The

764
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:24,469
concern is that, he may make another
attempt at killing himself. In fact, it is

765
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:27,639
a certainty that he will.

766
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,960
Doesn't she realize what she's doing?

767
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:44,360
The problem is, emotionally and physically, he sees himself as a woman,

768
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:49,500
with the exception of his genitals.

769
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:54,180
Genitals that lie about who he is.

770
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,600
Self castration is his way of telling the

771
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,460
truth, even if it means killing himself.

772
01:24:01,467 --> 01:24:03,834
Something has to be done.

773
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:04,970
He's a prime

774
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:11,900
candidate for sexual reassignment, the
problem is, such an operation cost ten

775
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:17,480
thousand dollars and there are no
insurance programs that cover it.

776
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:24,530
and coupled with the costs of reconstructive
plastic surgery for his face

777
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:27,910
you're talking another five thousand.

778
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:39,200
You mean, for a measly 15 grand she's gonna die?

779
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:56,200
Love is the symbiotic twin of friendship
and like love, if you find one true

780
01:25:56,210 --> 01:26:01,140
friend in a lifetime, you can count
yourself as lucky.

781
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:06,770
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

782
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:14,330
Only the brave can walk the path that
leads to love. In spite of my faults and

783
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:21,660
insecurities, I shall continue to walk
the path, a path not for the meek or

784
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:33,720
arrogant, an oftentimes lonely path,
nonetheless...I walk...

785
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:52,040
It was recently reported in a local
newspaper of the untimely death of doctor

786
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:58,070
Robinson. Talk is he was out for a
midnight stroll when for no apparent

787
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:03,200
reason he was pounced upon. Why remains a

788
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,560
mystery.

789
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:13,500
Thanks to the miracles of modern
technology and a generous benefactor

790
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:21,710
Maria's plastic surgery was a success as
well as her other operation. She even

791
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:28,450
went on get married and have kids. Well
she actually didn't give birth.

792
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:33,880
She adopted Debbie and her baby sister
Rochelle.

793
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:49,290
The mystery as to why woodpecker
couldn't speak like normal people

794
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:55,890
was learned just a few weeks ago. At the age of five woodpecker

795
01:27:55,890 --> 01:28:06,150
witnessed the rape of his beloved mother
by several men. Speaking of finding one

796
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:11,610
soul mate, it seems that's exactly what a
woodpecker has found.

797
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:18,240
They call her Hummingbird. I can't make this stuff up. Hard to believe he found someone to sit

798
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,580
up in the trees with them at night. You
never know who's watching you, just look

799
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:31,500
up. Might be woodpecker and...Hummingbird looking back at cha.

800
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:48,380
A child a baby was left at my doorstep
on one of the most beautiful mornings

801
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:55,200
God ever created. I knew immediately this
child was a part of me.

802
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:16,260
Sally realized she was not cut out for raising a child. The joys and fears of fatherhood are many

803
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:22,790
hopefully the joys will outweigh the
fears. Right now my baby needs nurturing

804
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:32,900
and so do I. Hmm, I finally got my girl.

805
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:55,500
Life is very simple now. Finally love has come

806
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:01,010
and found me. Like a lost puppy
in an unfamiliar neighborhood, I was

807
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:07,900
taken in from the cold. Just when I was
at my worst end, God looked down and

808
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:15,430
smiled, then bought me Joy. Joy is my daughter.

809
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:22,600
being with her fills me with constant
surprise. She continually pulls from my

810
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:29,720
heart, all the beautiful belongings
that no one else including myself had

811
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:34,140
looked quite far enough to find.

812
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,500
These are very nice. These are all mine?

813
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,080
uh-huh

814
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,100
Ah this is so nice.

815
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,220
This is so nice...

816
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:20,300
I love you.

817
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,060
I love you too.

818
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,200
For you.

819
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,240
I love you daddy.

820
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,040
I did it, I did it, I did it!

821
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,060
You did!

822
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,540
I should go.

823
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,940
Bye sweetheart.

824
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:38,700
My love for her is unconditional, which
time cannot mar or destroy, even though

825
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:43,920
she will one day leave my side in seek
of tomorrow's bright hopes with there

826
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:52,740
bitter sorrows. I will always be there
watching, yearning to hold her again to

827
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:55,220
my heart!

828
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:06,050
In the meantime, life is for the living
and it goes on.

829
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:19,260
Aren't the leaves just beautiful this
time of year?

830
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,270
Oh yes and the colors are

831
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:24,500
just so earthy.

832
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:38,890
Are you free tonight sugar?

833
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:06,580
Build your dreams to the stars above

834
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:14,620
but when you need someone true love

835
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:36,080

to me, come home to me, play with fire

836

01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:53,740

heart you'll follow your heart I know
