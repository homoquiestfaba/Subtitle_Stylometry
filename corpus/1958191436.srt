180
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:15,991
- [Maxine] You should
have walked away.

181
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,284
- What... I did.

182
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,286
- Well, you should've
walked faster.

183
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,346
- Well, are you mad at me?

184
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,496
I didn't do anything!

185
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:22,765
- No, but you could
have done something

186
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,229
to get yourself
outta that situation.

187
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:35,802
- Here you go.

188
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:37,804
- Okay, that's very thoughtful.

189
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,032
- You're welcome.
- Go to your room.

190

to see how you're doing.

So what?

- I don't have a
lot of time left.

220
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:02,097
And anyway, the warden
has made me an offer.

221

of time to play catch up,

so say what you wanna say.

223

left, I would like

if you sign for me,

I could spend my last days with
you, outside of this place.

228

Compassionate release.

You still there?

230
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,379
- You have the nerve to
call me after 12 years

231
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,506
to tell me that you
wanna live with me?

232
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,259
- [Max] I just thought maybe...

233
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:40,385
- Well, you thought wrong.

234
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,636
Don't call here again.

- Ezra.

241
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:57,486

Vegas crime show, okay?

I don't want you
watching that anymore.

You afraid I'll see Dad?

00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:39,137
- I appreciate it.

359
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:42,557
Keep up with the steps.

360
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,309
- One day at a time.

361
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,011
I love you.

362
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,896
Don't ever tell
anyone said that.

363
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:51,774
- Watch your step.

364
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:07,874
- My God.

365
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,459
You're still so beautiful.

366
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,336
- I'm not interested
in making you

367
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:12,587
feel better before you die.

368
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,174
I need cash, that's
why I'm doing this.

369
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:17,383
You're a tenant.

370
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:18,176
That's it.

371
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:23,848
As far as Ezra's concerned,
you're my uncle or something.

372
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,683
You can't tell him
you're my father, okay?

373
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:26,851
You do that, you're out.

374
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:27,894
- Oh, come, Max.

375
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,354
- No, I am dead serious.

376
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:30,275
Don't test me on this.

377
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:36,361
- [officer] You have a 50
yard radius from the house.

378

You take it off or you
mess with it in any way,

379
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:43,368
it's gonna go off,
and we come get you,

380
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,161
which means you'll
be right back inside.

381
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,706
- I understand the
meaning of house arrest.

382
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:49,975
- If you have a
doctor's appointment,

383
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,876
we need to know in advance.

384
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:54,629
Don't make us come back here.

385

387

I've seen this place.

388

Hasn't changed much.

389
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:21,781
- Well, it's a dump,
filled with bad memories.

390
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:25,201
- Not all bad.

391
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,580
- How would you know?

392
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,664
You missed everything.

393
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,209
- I'm not that guy anymore.

394
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,005
- Okay.

395
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:39,007
If my ex didn't bury us
in debt, I'd sell it.

396
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:39,928
I'm upside down on it.

397
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,595
- How did that happen?

398
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:45,013
- I don't know.

399
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:47,223
Maybe since you were in
jail most of my life,

400
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:51,019
I didn't have anybody giving
me any fatherly advice.

401
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,270
I have to pick up Ezra.

402
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:53,187
You can take my room.

403
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:55,982
- I can't do that.

404
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,775
- Well, it's either
that or the couch,

405
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,987
and I'd like it if you spent
as much time outta sight

406
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,904
as possible, so.

407
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,201
I'll sleep in Ezra's room.

409
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:10,872

- How bad is it?

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,959

412
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:16,919
Oh.

413
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:24,218
This is my gate money,
and whet I earned inside.

414
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,012
I'll have more soon.

415
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:27,615
- Okay, but I don't want
you bringing your past

416
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,808
in my house, and no
drinking or drugs.

417

touched a drug in 12 years.

- Some guy called
Max on the phone?

535
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,944
- Am I dreaming?

536
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,403
- Another ball-buster, huh?

537
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,197
- Well, you tell me.

538
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,407
She's a pain in my ass,
but she's good to me.

539
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:26,176
How are you, my friend?

540
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,119
When'd you get out?

541
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,370
- I didn't really get out.

542
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:30,704
- You escaped, didn't you?

543
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:31,956
Holy shit!

544
00:29:31,997 --> 00:29:33,707
- Don't get too excited.

545
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,126
- Max.

546
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,293
Come by.

547
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:37,002
- Listen.

548
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:40,714
I'm not doing so good.

549
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:43,008
- Yeah, well, we're
getting old, buddy.

550
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,804
- Look, that seed
money I gave you

551
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:48,597
100 years ago for the gym.

552
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:51,016
If you got it, I could use it.

553
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:51,976
- Shit, Max.

554
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,436
If I'd known sooner...

555
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,480
It's pretty bad right now.

556
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:59,316
Most of these fighters
are training for free.

557
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:01,527
Haven't had a
contender in a while.

558
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,778
- Say no more.

559
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,155
I just thought I'd ask.

560
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:05,990
- [Hank] I'm an asshole.

561
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:07,592
I should have been putting
something away, I know, but-

562
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,034
- I gave you that money.

563
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:10,578
You don't owe me shit.

564
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:12,246
- Max, if it wasn't for you-

565
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:13,265
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:14,456
Save it, save it.

567
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:19,378
- I'll come by and
say a proper hello.

568
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,423
- Oh, I'm at the old house.

569
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,584
- [Hank] Okay, I'll see you.

570
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,596
[phone beeps]

571
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:45,279
- What's up, twitcher?

572
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,616
Probably deaf as well.

573
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,242
- Nope, I can hear you.

574
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:50,993
- Oh!

575
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,369
He speaks too.

576
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:54,038
- And you walk upright.

577
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,080
Amazing.

578
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:55,873
Evolution.

579
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,001
- Aren't you smart?

580
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,586
- A little, yeah.

581
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,421
It's too bad I can't
say the same about you.

582
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:05,591
- You want another beating?

583
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:08,510
- I have a feeling that's
a rhetorical question,

584
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:09,637
but the answer would be no.

585
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,807
[tense music]

586
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:14,600
- Oh.

587
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:19,897
Guess you don't have a big
mouth now, do you, twitcher?

588
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,655
[Max coughing]

589
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:46,632
[car approaching]

590
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:53,639
- Yarek?
[car door closes]

591
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:55,849
The infamous Max MacLeary.

592
00:31:58,477 --> 00:31:59,561
Did you get Botox?

593
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:01,605
- Fuck you, lots of men get it.

594
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:06,652
- I told you, boy, we're good.

595
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:08,612
- Max, relax, I just
wanted to see you.

596
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:13,575
- You know, our
past dies with me.

597
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,119
I just wanna make that crystal.

598
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,495
- Of course.

599
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:17,806
Max, you could have
said a lot of things

600
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,624
to make your life
easier, but you didn't,

601
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,335
and that kind of loyalty,
that doesn't exist anymore,

602
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:26,880
so anything you
need, you just ask.

603
00:32:28,924 --> 00:32:29,675
- Actually.

604
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:32,862
Your cousin still
do construction?

605
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:33,595
- Yeah.

606
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:36,724
Really, that's what you want?

607
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,852
All right, have a
crew here tomorrow,

608
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,729
make you a nice man cave.

609
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,647
Mirrors, bar, the whole thing.

610
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:52,698
- I have epilepsy.

611
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:55,993
- That some kind of superpower?

612
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:58,912
- Yeah.

613
00:32:58,954 --> 00:33:00,164
They call me the Twitcher.

614
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:09,006
- Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

615
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:10,132
- That would be correct.

616
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:13,719
This kid wants to kill me.

617
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,721
- Did you know I was a boxer?

618
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:18,557
- I didn't even know you existed
until like a few days ago.

619
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:23,562
- Come on.

620
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,652
Is this the same kid
that beat you up?

621
00:33:30,694 --> 00:33:31,570
- Same one.

622
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,740
He's hated me since
like first grade.

623
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:36,492
And then he pulled
a knife on me.

624
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,203
What would you do?

625
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:40,996
- What I would do and
what you should do

626
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:42,790
are two totally
different things.

627
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,460
- Seriously.
- You fight him.

628
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:50,130
- But he has a knife.
- Trust me, he won't use it.

629
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:51,382
How old is he?

630
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:53,175
- 12, and trust me.

631
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:54,968
Have you not seen
the news lately?

632
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,178
- Okay, okay.

633
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,881
Stand up.

634
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:00,891
Do me a favor,
get your hands up.

635
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,728
You always have to
protect yourself.

636
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,772
Chin down, hands up.

637
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:07,898
Yeah, like that.

638
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,100
And whenever the punch comes,

639
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:11,819
your fists take the brunt of it.

640
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,889
You might get clipped, but your
hands are always, always up.

641
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:18,826
That's good, good, good.

642
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,996
You got it, you
got it, you got it.

643
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:26,083
Good, good, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

644
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,459
Wow.

645
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,252
Wow.

646
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,838
I think I need a popsicle.

647
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:34,809
- Shit, she's home.

648
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,303
- Oh, you came home early?

649
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,388
What happened?

650
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,097
Are you okay?

651
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,848
Did you have a...

652
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:43,475
- You can say it, Mom.

653
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:44,518
I didn't have a seizure.

654
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:47,521
Just my stomach was hurting.

655
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:51,733
- And what have you
guys been up to?

656
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:53,944
- Just talking.

657
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:57,781
- Okay, go wash
up before dinner.

658
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,013
You didn't say anything
to him, did you?

659
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:05,831
- No.

660
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:10,043
I'd like to, but since the
kid thinks I'm dead, you know.

661
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:11,837
- That's my fault?

662
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:14,149
- He was just showing me the
backyard, you know, the roses.

663
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:16,842
They must be, God, 30 years old.

664
00:35:16,884 --> 00:35:18,510
I remember when your
mother planted it.

665
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:21,889
Yeah.

666
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:24,266
You know...

667
00:35:29,813 --> 00:35:31,565
What are those?

668
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,567
- It's a Rice Krispy treat.

669
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,986
- Rice what?
- Krispies.

670
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:36,904
- Oh.

671
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:38,780
- Yeah, try one.
- No, I don't think so.

672
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:40,073
- You know Max was a boxer?

673
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,373
No, I mean, he was on the
phone and he was saying-

674
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:49,583
- Are you lying to me?

675
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:51,585
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

676
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,339
- It wasn't his fault.

677
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,798
We got to talking.

678
00:35:59,718 --> 00:36:02,387
- Did he tell you he
was one of the top

679
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:03,972
amateur fighters in Nevada?

680
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:06,183
- He was?

681
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:06,934
No.

682
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,603
- Go to my room.

683
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:10,580
- Wait, am I grounded again?

684
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:12,314
- No, goofy boy, my room.

685
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:14,316
There's a photo
album, third drawer.

686
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,946
[Max sighs]
- Hey.

687
00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:19,738
- I'm sorry.

688
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:23,033
Yeah, yeah, it's
fine, I'm sorry.

689
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:28,914
He came home, and he
asks a lot of questions.

690
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:30,832
- I know, it's nonstop
with the questions.

691
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:36,046
He can't just sit
in silence, I guess.

692
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:37,756
- Oh, he'd make a good lawyer.

693
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:41,426
You know, you remember when
you wanted to be a lawyer?

694
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:42,886
Get me out of prison.

695
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:44,763
- I was seven.

696
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,056
- Oh yeah, but you were smart.

697
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,768
- Aww, look at the baby.

698
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,060
- [Ezra] My first recital.

699
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:57,609
- Wow.

700
00:36:57,651 --> 00:36:59,152
Cher.

701
00:36:59,194 --> 00:36:59,987
- Yeah.

702
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:02,197
- Oh, you danced at Caesars?

703
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,200
- Yeah, that was a
short tour because I got

704
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:08,370
pregnant with somebody
who's sitting on this couch.

705
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:10,080
[Ezra laughs]
- Oh.

706
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:13,917
- [Ezra] I haven't
seen this one before.

707
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:16,628
- Give it back.

708
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,380
- Did you know my grandma?

709
00:37:18,422 --> 00:37:19,172
- A little.

710
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:21,883
- Mom never talks about her.

711
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:24,428
Mom never talks
about growing up.

712
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:26,346
- Because there's
nothing to talk about.

713
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:27,097
Here.

714
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:32,978
- When was this taken?

715
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:36,940
- I think I'm gonna
have to lie down.

716
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:39,693
[Max groaning]

717
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:40,944
- Are you okay?

718
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,946
[Max groaning]

719
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:43,989
Get my phone.

720
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:44,698
Ezra!

721
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,490
Call 911!

722
00:37:46,992 --> 00:37:48,160
You're okay.

723
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:53,040
You're okay. [siren wailing]

724
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,671
- What's wrong with you?

725
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:00,922
- Max is sick, Ezra.

726
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:02,066
- Well yeah, I can see that.

727
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,635
Calling the ambulance
kind of gave it away.

728
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,136
- I have cancer, pal.

729
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:09,473
- Is he gonna die?

730
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:11,159
- I'll let your grandfather
explain his conditions.

731
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:11,933
- He's my uncle.

732
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:15,862
- [Paramedic] Sir, I
think we should take you

733
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,689
to the hospital to
get checked out.

734
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:18,482
- I'm dying.

735
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:22,319
Nothing's gonna change that.

736
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:24,112
- If you're
concerned about this,

737
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:25,614
we can just call
your parole officer.

738
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:30,077
- I am not going
to the hospital.

739
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:32,704
End of story.

740
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:34,956
Thank you.

741
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,999
Thank you.

742
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,085
Much appreciated.

743
00:38:42,506 --> 00:38:43,715
- What is this?

744
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:45,300
- Oh, that, that's my new PS5.

745
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:48,720
- Seriously, what
the hell is going on?

746
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,264
Are you really dying?

747
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,102
- Yes, I am.

748
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:00,107
[solemn music]

749
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,155
- [Maxine] You do that?

750
00:39:48,196 --> 00:39:49,906
- Yeah, yeah.

751
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:51,616
I'm feeling a bit better.

752
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:55,579
Figured I'd take advantage
of the good days.

753
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:05,088
I've been thinking.

754
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,049
Maybe I should go.

755
00:40:08,091 --> 00:40:09,718
- No, no, no.

756
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,886
You don't have to do that.

757
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,099
- It's just, you
know, Ezra, you...

758
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,952
- Max, I heard you throwing
up in the bathroom.

759
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:19,102
So gross!

760
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,270
- Good morning.

761
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:21,146
There's my son.

762
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,607
- Give me a break, Mom, I'm 12.

763
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:26,193
I don't understand half the
stuff that comes outta my mouth.

764
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:27,861
- Yeah, I don't buy that.

765
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:30,197
Since the same kid corrected
my grammar on a school note.

766
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:32,365
- Who ends a sentence
with a dangling modifier?

767
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:33,950
It's pretty
straightforward stuff.

768
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:35,136
- Dangling what?
- No, no, no.

769
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,204
Don't ask, you'll
be here all day.

770
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:39,456
- Careful.

771
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:40,582
It's hot.

772
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,426
- [Ezra] Thank you.

773
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:49,674
- Okay.

774
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:56,139
So listen, I have
something to tell you.

775
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,227
- That Max is your father?

776
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:03,104
Which would make
him my grandfather,

777
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:05,190
who you told me was dead.

778
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,651
I'd say you have
something to tell me.

779
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:10,237
[pensive music]

780
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:12,864
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around all of this.

781
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:14,258
- [Maxine] You sure
you're an honor student?

782
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:16,618
'Cause I've explained
it like four times.

783
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,661
- Why did you lie to me?

784
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,373
- It's complicated.

785
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:22,892
- Can I use that
same excuse next time

786
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,084
you ask me if I'm lying?

787
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,126
- No chance.

788
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:28,296
- Is there anything
else I need to know?

789
00:41:28,338 --> 00:41:30,233
Because if I ever do like
a 23andme at some point.

790
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:32,676
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

791
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:34,386
Watch where you're
going, asshole!

792
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:36,513
- Dad!
- Ezra, stay in the car.

793
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,431
- Oh, hey, boy, you good?
- Yeah, I'm good!

794
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:39,140
- Ah.

795
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:41,518
Man.

796
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,477
- I've missed you.

797
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,895
- Come on, you're gonna be late.

798
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,480
- Mom, five minutes, please.

799
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:47,667
- Okay, you have until the bell.

800
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:48,650
- Oh my God.

801
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:49,526
Are you growing?

802
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,194
You're so tall.

803
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:52,863
Hey, Mr. Licorice.

804
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:53,905
Hey, hey, hey.

805
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:54,867
Check out what I found.

806
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:58,285
It's my old band's t-shirt,
man, isn't that sick?

807
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:00,036
- It's amazing.
- You want it?

808
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:03,248
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- You remember this, Maxine?

809
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,475
- Come on, let's go, it's time.

810
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:06,251
- [Ezra] It's fine.

811
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:11,172
- Hey, yo, I got you a
1964 Ludwig drum set.

812
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:13,258
It's all set up at my
house ready for you

813
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,467
to come and stay with me.

814
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:15,927
- Can I, Mom, please?

815
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,888
- Yeah, we'll see.

816
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:18,889
[bell ringing]

817
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,056
Okay, it's time go.

818
00:42:20,098 --> 00:42:21,349
- I'll get the second bell.

819
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:22,934
Okay, when can I
stay at your place?

820
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:23,953
- [Maxine] Come on, you can
see your father another time.

821
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:24,954
- It's fine.
- Say goodbye.

822
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:26,354
- Mom, I haven't seen him.

823
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:28,291
- I'm gonna walk you in myself
if you don't go now, okay?

824
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:29,274
I'm not kidding.

825
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:30,191
I'll hold your hand.

826
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,693
- Yeah, she makes up the rules.

827
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:32,986
You know this, all right?

828
00:42:34,362 --> 00:42:36,448
- Can't stop me from seeing him.

829
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,199
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

830
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:40,327
- I fought the law and...

831
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:43,413
- The Lord won.

832
00:42:43,455 --> 00:42:45,123
- No, the law won, son.

833
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,335
I love you, buddy.

834
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:49,461
- Okay.

835
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:51,755
Bye.
- Go get in there, you genius.

836
00:42:54,382 --> 00:42:56,718
- You can't show
up here like this.

837
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,595
- Relax.

838
00:42:58,637 --> 00:43:01,514
Why do you always treat me
like an asshole all the time?

839
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:03,767
- Stop being an
asshole all the time.

840
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:05,143
A new drum set?

841
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:06,519
- What?
- You're high, Tyler.

842
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:10,207
All this bullshit pretending
you care about him,

843
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:10,958
it's not about him.

844
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:12,609
- I do care about him.

845
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:15,320
- Well, if you care,
then you'll get clean.

846
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,489
- You can't stop
me from seeing him.

847
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,448
- No?

848
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,783
Watch me.

849
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:20,801
I'm not putting him through
your bullshit again.

850
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:23,328
[engine starts]

851
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:26,790
- Max.

852
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,293
- Took you long enough.

853
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:32,379
- Between the broad and
these pussy-ass fighters.

854
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:36,007
- What the hell?

855
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:38,176
You lost like 40 pounds?

856
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:41,471
- 48, been sober five
years, eating oatmeal.

857
00:43:41,513 --> 00:43:42,514
- Oh.

858
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:43,366
Well, I know the
world's going to hell

859
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,808
if you're eating oatmeal.

860
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:45,642
- Tell me about it.

861
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:48,812
Look, best I could do.

862
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:52,065
- I told you it was fine.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

863
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:54,609
I had to sell a few
things, but here it is.

864
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:55,312
I owe you, Max.

865
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:59,781
- I can't take this.

866
00:43:59,823 --> 00:44:01,366
- Fuck you, take it.

867
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,284
If I can scrape together
some more, I will.

868
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:06,287
- Thanks.

869
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:08,415
- What's going on here?

870
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:10,375
- I called in a
favor from Yarek.

871
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:14,295
- Ah, that's a name
I could live without.

872
00:44:14,337 --> 00:44:17,424
- Oh, we're square.
- Yeah.

873
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:20,885
Look, I gotta go,
teaching a boxing class

874
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:23,096
with some old white women.

875
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,597
I'm sorry about your, you know.

876
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:28,935
- We're all going to
die, Hank, even you.

877
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:31,062
- Oh yeah.
- No, not me.

878
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:32,856
Uh-uh, never me.

879
00:44:32,897 --> 00:44:35,442
[both chuckling]

880
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:36,526
See you, Max.
- See ya.

881
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:44,451
- What the hell's going on?

882
00:44:44,492 --> 00:44:46,536
I come home, there's
guys working.

883
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:47,722
What do you think you're doing?

884
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:50,123
- Oh, just fixing
up a few things.

885
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:52,542
- You should have asked me.

886
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:53,664
- I wanted to surprise you.

887
00:44:54,836 --> 00:44:56,087
- Okay.

888
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:57,422
Well, I'm surprised.

889
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:06,347
- Hey, did I ever tell you
why we called you Maxine?

890
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:12,228
- Because you have a giant ego
and you really wanted a boy.

891
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,355
- No, no, it was your mother.

892
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:17,400
We were young.

893
00:45:17,442 --> 00:45:19,486
We didn't know any better.

894
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:24,491
But she said you were a natural
born fighter from day one.

895
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:27,869
- Look how far that got me.

896
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:31,081
I asked you not to
bring your shit here.

897
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:32,665
- I'm not.

898
00:45:32,707 --> 00:45:36,044
I promised your mother
years ago that I'd

899
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:38,379
finish that little
apartment, never did,

900
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:41,382
I'm doing it now so
you can rent it out.

901
00:45:42,967 --> 00:45:45,136
- Oh, now you wanna keep
your promises to Mom?

902
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:47,514
You're unbelievable.

903
00:45:48,973 --> 00:45:50,350
What's that?

904
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:52,685
- This is for you.

905
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,314
It's all I have to my
name, and it's yours.

906
00:45:56,356 --> 00:45:57,690
- I don't want your dirty money.

907
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:58,775
- It's good money.

908
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:00,193
- Bullshit!

909
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,153
Knowing you, somebody
got hurt for that money.

910
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:03,321
- It's clean.

911
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:07,158
Stop being so
stubborn and take it.

912
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,537
I've also lined up a
job interview for you.

913
00:46:10,578 --> 00:46:11,287
- You what?

914
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:12,539
- A job, a real job.

915
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,707
A friend of mine.

916
00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:16,477
He's got a bunch of
businesses, I got you in.

917
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:17,418
- Why?

918
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,711
- Why?

919
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:19,629
Why?

920
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,423
Because you're my kid.

921
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,968
It's the least I could do.

922
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:26,761
- Okay, stop.

923
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:30,807
- Oh, I'm a piece
of shit, I know.

924
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:33,560
- No, you don't
get off that easy.

925
00:46:35,687 --> 00:46:38,731
Now you're trying to
take responsibility?

926
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:41,943
Now you wanna keep
your promises to Mom?

927
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:43,504
I had to sit in this
house and watch her

928
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:44,571
drink herself to death.

929
00:46:46,781 --> 00:46:48,241
- Your mother had problems.

930
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,243
- Yeah, no shit
she had problems.

931
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:51,762
You didn't have to wake
up at three in the morning

932
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:54,998
to her screaming, lying on
the kitchen floor, here.

933
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:56,541
Right here.

934
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,501
Drunk off her ass,
knife in her hand.

935
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:00,378
She was cutting her arms.

936
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,631
She was too fucked up
to even kill herself.

937
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:05,276
And then when she saw me,
she started screaming,

938
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,343
"I hate you, I hate you.

939
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:08,553
You've ruined my life."

940
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:11,681
You didn't have
to deal with that.

941
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:13,266
I did.

942
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:16,644
I would wait for her to pass
out, drag her ass to bed,

943
00:47:16,686 --> 00:47:20,023
clean up the blood,
and go to school hungry

944
00:47:20,064 --> 00:47:22,609
because she'd spent
all her money on booze.

945
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,277
I had to deal with that.

946
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,778
And where were you?

947
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,572
I'll tell you.

948
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:31,701
You were off in Miami
doing some messed up shit,

949
00:47:31,743 --> 00:47:33,077
or you were in prison.

950
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,621
Mostly in prison.

951
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:37,373
But I'll tell you
where you weren't.

952
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:38,124
You weren't here.

953
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,960
- Maxie, please.

954
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:44,631
- But I stayed right to the
end, because that's what you do.

955
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,526
So don't come in here now
like you're some kind of

956
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,885
fucking hero, 'cause you're not.

957
00:47:55,308 --> 00:47:57,227
- You have every
reason to hate me.

958
00:47:57,268 --> 00:47:58,561
I'm sorry.

959
00:47:58,603 --> 00:48:00,855
I really, really don't
know what to say.

960
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:02,315
- Well, there's nothing to say.

961
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:03,691
- I fucked up, I know.

962
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:05,333
The shit I had to do
to protect you guys.

963
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,029
- [Maxine] Stop,
stop, I can't, please.

964
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:09,656
- Maxie, please.

965
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:11,199
I know, I know.

966
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:14,077
None of this will make up
for who I was or what I did.

967
00:48:14,118 --> 00:48:15,620
I know that.

968
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:19,832
But you're my daughter, and
what I should have done then,

969
00:48:21,751 --> 00:48:24,754
I didn't, and it kills me
every day that I didn't.

970
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:29,300
But please, Maxie.

971
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:30,093
Please.

972
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:32,595
I'm asking you.

973
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:33,721
I'm begging you.

974
00:48:34,722 --> 00:48:39,560
Please, please, let me
be your father for once.

975
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:42,897
Please?

976
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:46,526
Please?

977
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,903
[Maxine crying]

978
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,573
Look, there's nothing
wrong with this money.

979
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:53,366
Nothing.

980
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,078
It's as clean as it'll get.

981
00:48:58,162 --> 00:48:59,789
And it's yours.

982
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:00,915
Now you take it.

983
00:49:00,957 --> 00:49:03,668
You could use it
for Ezra's college.

984
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:08,193
- He's not gonna be
anything like you.

985
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:09,924
Or his father.

986
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:11,718
Or me.

987
00:49:14,387 --> 00:49:15,805
- You're not so bad.

988
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:43,166
- Hey, baby.
- I'm not your fucking baby.

989
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:46,961
[door slams]

990
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:58,198
- Will you tell me how many people
are coming to your birthday?

991
00:49:58,222 --> 00:49:59,662
Because I have to
preorder the pizza.

992
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:01,768
- No idea.

993
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:07,190
- You want anything
special for your birthday?

994
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,649
- Yeah.

995
00:50:08,691 --> 00:50:09,776
A set of balls.

996
00:50:13,196 --> 00:50:15,740
I'm tired of being
picked on all the time.

997
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,743
You don't get it, Mom.

998
00:50:18,785 --> 00:50:20,161
- What's to get?

999
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:22,455
You're letting a bunch
of idiots run your life.

1000
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:24,749
- 'Cause they can run my life.

1001
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,542
I mean, come on,
Mom, look at you.

1002
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:27,585
Do you have a job?

1003
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:30,963
- I had two jobs, smart mouth.

1004
00:50:31,005 --> 00:50:33,466
And I'm looking, so
drop the attitude.

1005
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:35,426
- What, some minimum wage jobs?

1006
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:38,721
What do you do, clean costumes,
work at Nachos Fully Loaded?

1007
00:50:38,763 --> 00:50:40,723
- I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

1008
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:43,267
We have food on the table.

1009
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:44,769
We have a roof over our heads.

1010
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:46,813
- You're three months
behind on the mortgage.

1011
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:48,981
I can read, Mom.

1012
00:50:49,023 --> 00:50:50,066
Really well, actually.

1013
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,457
- Since you read
so well, read that.

1014
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:07,708
What does that say, hmm?

1015
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,502
That says all paid up.

1016
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:11,629
- It actually just says "Paid."

1017
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:13,065
- You're being a
little shit right now.

1018
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:14,590
- I want to see my dad.

1019
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:15,675
- I know.

1020
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,093
I want that for you too, I do.

1021
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:20,721
Your father made his choices.

1022
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:22,390
- You kicked him out!

1023
00:51:22,432 --> 00:51:24,517
You never gave him a chance!

1024
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,227
- I give him plenty of chances.

1025
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:27,311
You have no idea.

1026
00:51:30,898 --> 00:51:32,692
He's not trustworthy.

1027
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:33,818
I'm sorry, Ezra.

1028
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:37,280
He's not careful with you.

1029
00:51:37,321 --> 00:51:38,739
He does bad things.

1030
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:39,883
- Oh yeah, just
like your father?

1031
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:41,534
No offense, Grandpa.
- None taken.

1032
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:43,494
- Don't talk about your
grandfather like that.

1033
00:51:43,536 --> 00:51:44,871
- Why?

1034
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:46,539
He literally just
got out of jail.

1035
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:47,874
- Kid's got a point.
- Shut up.

1036
00:51:47,915 --> 00:51:49,542
- You're such a hypocrite!

1037
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:50,751
- Hey, get back here, Ezra!

1038
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:57,800
I do everything for that kid.

1039
00:51:57,842 --> 00:51:59,302
Everything.

1040
00:51:59,343 --> 00:52:01,554
Tyler doesn't do
shit, he never has.

1041
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:03,097
Ezra like worships him.

1042
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,683
- Let me talk to him.

1043
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:15,776
[knocking on door]

1044
00:52:15,818 --> 00:52:16,569
- Go away!

1045
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:23,451
Go away doesn't
mean open the door.

1046
00:52:23,493 --> 00:52:24,702
You're invading my privacy.

1047
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,920
- Take a breath, kid.

1048
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:30,964
Let me say something.

1049
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,879
You want the kid version
or the man version?

1050
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,131
- Don't care.
- All right.

1051
00:52:37,173 --> 00:52:38,591
All right.

1052
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:40,301
I'll give you the kid version.

1053
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:42,303
- Give me the man version.

1054
00:52:45,097 --> 00:52:47,808
- Your father, that
you love so much,

1055
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:52,813
is a loser, plain and simple.

1056
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,026
He's a drug addict who cares
about no one but himself.

1057
00:52:58,528 --> 00:53:01,906
If he cared for
you, he'd get clean,

1058
00:53:01,948 --> 00:53:04,116
give money to your
mother, come see you,

1059
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:06,035
and stop banging whores.

1060
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:08,955
- Wow.

1061
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:12,041
- I know you love him.

1062
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:14,460
He doesn't deserve your love.

1063
00:53:16,128 --> 00:53:18,005
Trust me.

1064
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:19,632
I can write a book
on shitty fathers.

1065
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,343
Your mother loves you.

1066

One minute, please.

1416
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,978
- [Warden] Maxine, I have
already heard about it.

1417
01:10:57,022 --> 01:10:57,999
Now put the officer
on the phone.

1418
01:10:58,023 --> 01:10:59,041
- Could you just
talk to him, please?

1419
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:01,067
I have him on the
phone right now.

1420
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:03,903
- Hello?

1421
01:11:03,945 --> 01:11:04,964
- [Warden] Put him on the phone.

1422
01:11:04,988 --> 01:11:06,114
- Yes, sir, here he is.

1423
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:07,907
- Hello?

1424
01:11:09,868 --> 01:11:12,412
- [Warden] Max, you got yourself
in quite a situation there.

1425
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,044
- A little bit, but
I'm not gonna lie.

1426
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:20,712
It was kind of worth it.

1427
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:24,007
- Mm-hmm.

1428
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:28,470
Well, this is the first
and the last time.

1429
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,805
I don't have any more
strings to pull for you, Max.

1430
01:11:30,847 --> 01:11:31,931
- Right, right.

1431
01:11:32,724 --> 01:11:34,059
Thank you.

1432
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,810
- Put the officer
back on the phone.

1433
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:37,729
- Hello?
- Let him go.

1434
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:38,456
- [Officer] Yes, sir.

1435
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,648
I got it.

1437
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,194

1438
01:11:44,235 --> 01:11:46,488
Thank you, thank you so much.

1439
01:11:59,125 --> 01:11:59,876
- Wish me luck.

1440
01:12:02,087 --> 01:12:02,796
- Luck.

1441
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:05,965
Wow.

1442
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,718
- I'm scared.

1443
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,480
It's my first day.

1444
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:10,261
- Luck.

01:12:12,097 --> 01:12:13,723

job just because

1469

you are letting some stupid
little assholes ruin your life.

You do that?

Put that on.

mad at him, okay?

1481
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:04,751
If it wasn't for
Max, I'd probably

I never wanna do it again.

still grounded.

I be if I didn't ground you?

rent for this, you know.

01:15:13,695 --> 01:15:14,445
Thanks.

- Hey, hey, put that ice
pack back on your hand.

- Oh, don't be mad at him.

- I hate to admit it,
but I'm proud of him.

- Yeah, I knocked him down.

1521
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,961
You knocked him down?

1522
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:30,883
That's awesome, kiddo.

1523
01:15:32,297 --> 01:15:35,216
- [Ezra] Max is showing
me how to fight.

- Max?

1525
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:38,928
Who's Max?

1526
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:40,263
- He's just my grandpa.

gonna come on Saturday?

your mom's dad, Max?

- Yeah, he's been
living with us.

Wait, Mom's coming.

1532

Okay, just try to come to my
birthday party on Saturday.

Okay, bye.

- It was Dad, okay, but
Mom, before you freak out-

1536
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:56,946
- Did you tell him
about Saturday?

1537
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,781
- I'm not gonna lie.

1538
01:16:00,325 --> 01:16:03,578
Okay, I was gonna lie,
but I did tell him, yes.

1539
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,121
- Okay, next time
your father calls,

1540
01:16:05,163 --> 01:16:06,873
just give me the damn phone.

1541
01:16:06,915 --> 01:16:08,416
- I wanna see him, Mom.

1542
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:09,334
He's my dad.

1543
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:15,006
- I've got to get
rid of that landline.

1544
01:16:16,257 --> 01:16:17,484
- Maybe you should
think about it.

1545
01:16:17,508 --> 01:16:19,302
- Oh, don't you start.

1546
01:16:19,344 --> 01:16:21,763
- Well, it's just,
Ezra's a big boy.

1547
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:24,432
Try to make it work, that's all.

in town, huh?

1550
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:36,778
You think that's a good idea?

1551
01:16:36,819 --> 01:16:39,238
- Actually, it's the best
thing that's happened to us

1552
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,073
in a long time.

1553
01:16:46,746 --> 01:16:49,374
Do you think you can stop
using for your son's birthday?

1554
01:16:51,292 --> 01:16:53,586
- Maxie, I got it under control.

1555
01:16:53,628 --> 01:16:55,254
- Okay, stop, stop.

1556
01:16:55,296 --> 01:16:57,340
Can we just be
real for a second?

1557
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:00,802
You're an addict, Tyler.

1558
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:09,477
- Do you think I
want to be this way?

1559
01:17:10,853 --> 01:17:14,065
- This is about Ezra,
and he's gonna hate me

1560
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:15,316
if I don't let him see you.

1561
01:17:15,358 --> 01:17:17,652
- What do you
think's gonna happen?

1562
01:17:17,694 --> 01:17:18,403
Huh?

1563
01:17:22,407 --> 01:17:24,575
Just let me teach him how
to play the drums, huh?

1564
01:17:24,617 --> 01:17:26,786
It's the one goddamn
thing I'm good at.

1565
01:17:26,828 --> 01:17:28,287
It's the one thing.
- I know.

1566
01:17:29,914 --> 01:17:31,791
Just stop using
for one day, okay?

1567
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:32,713
That's all I'm asking.

[cheerful music] [kids
laughing and chattering]

1569
01:17:43,469 --> 01:17:44,303
- Oh, wow.

1570
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,308
- Hey, Grandpa.

1571
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:50,327
I was telling them
how you used to

1572
01:17:50,351 --> 01:17:51,853
beat people up for a living.

1573
01:17:51,894 --> 01:17:53,396
You went to prison.

1574
01:17:53,438 --> 01:17:55,523
- Somebody actually paid
you to beat people up?

1575
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:57,108
How much?

1576
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:58,317
- What are you, a cop?

1577
01:18:01,696 --> 01:18:03,614
- [Maxine] Okay,
who wants pizza?

1578
01:18:03,656 --> 01:18:06,367
- Oh my gosh.

1579
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:07,869
- [Maxine] Oh, oh.

1580
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,412
- You don't have to
touch every slice.

1581
01:18:11,372 --> 01:18:13,207
- I'm gonna lie down for a bit.

1582
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:14,625
Call me when it's cake.

1583
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:15,877
- Okay.

1584
01:18:15,918 --> 01:18:17,462
- Is Grandpa okay?

1585
01:18:17,503 --> 01:18:19,922
- Yeah, he just
wants to lay down.

1586
01:18:19,964 --> 01:18:20,840
Happy birthday, baby.

1587
01:18:20,882 --> 01:18:22,133
- Hey!
- Dad!

1588
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:24,427
- Bottom of the ninth,
here comes raw daddy-oh!

1589
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:26,054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1590
01:18:26,095 --> 01:18:27,889
Hey, happy birthday, man.

1591
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,140
We got beer.

1592
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:30,892
Look at that
baseball glove, huh?

1593
01:18:30,933 --> 01:18:32,560
That's real leather, man.

1594
01:18:32,602 --> 01:18:33,620
- [Ezra] Okay, thanks, Dad.

1595
01:18:33,644 --> 01:18:35,897
- What, okay,
"okay, thanks, Dad."

1596
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:37,899
How you doing, Maxie, huh?

1597
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,192
- Can we speak for a second?

1598
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:45,364
- Hey, hey, buddy Mommy
and Daddy need to talk.

1599
01:18:46,908 --> 01:18:47,658
- Okay.

1600
01:18:50,411 --> 01:18:52,121
- I asked you for one thing.

1601
01:18:52,163 --> 01:18:53,664
You're not clean.

1602
01:18:53,706 --> 01:18:57,251
- Look, I'm trying to be
a part of my kid's life.

1603
01:18:57,293 --> 01:18:59,253
Isn't that a good thing?

1604
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:00,175
- No, you've gotta go.

1605
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:01,380
- No, no, whoa, hey, wait.

1606
01:19:01,422 --> 01:19:03,633
Will you quit breaking my balls?

1607
01:19:03,674 --> 01:19:04,592
All right?

1608
01:19:04,634 --> 01:19:06,135
I'm hanging with Ezra.

1609
01:19:06,177 --> 01:19:09,472
It's the birthday party.

1610
01:19:09,514 --> 01:19:11,390
Oh shit, yo, whoa,
whoa, we got pepperoni.

1611
01:19:11,432 --> 01:19:12,159
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa.

1612
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:13,559
Oh.

1613
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:14,953
- I got it.
- No, no, I got it, I got it.

1614
01:19:14,977 --> 01:19:16,497
I got it, I got it, chill,
chill, chill, chill.

1615
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:17,522
Bro, I got it.
- I got it.

1616
01:19:17,563 --> 01:19:18,916
- No, that's what
the ground's for.

1617
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,608
- [Maxine] It's fine.

1618
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:23,277
- Come on, no party foul.

1619
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:24,946
No way.

1620
01:19:24,987 --> 01:19:26,280
See?
- Dad, stop.

1621
01:19:26,322 --> 01:19:27,031
- Mm.

1622
01:19:27,949 --> 01:19:29,450
Oh, come on, what?

1623
01:19:29,492 --> 01:19:31,536
Come on, man, you want
me to stay, don't you?

1624
01:19:31,577 --> 01:19:34,163
Come on, tell your mom
you want me to stay.

1625
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:37,625
- I do, but you're not...

1626
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:39,168
You just knocked
over everything.

1627
01:19:42,213 --> 01:19:43,756
- It was an accident.

1628
01:19:43,798 --> 01:19:45,258
Was she brainwashing you, man?

1629
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:49,303
Did you tell my kid
I'm the bad guy?

1630
01:19:49,345 --> 01:19:50,489
- It's fine.
- No, I'm his father!

1631
01:19:50,513 --> 01:19:51,722
- It's fine.
- I'm his father!

1632
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:52,473
- Stay, okay?

1633
01:19:52,515 --> 01:19:53,432
It's fine.

1634
01:19:53,474 --> 01:19:54,684
Stay here.

1635
01:19:54,725 --> 01:19:56,435
- You're fuckin-A
right I'm staying.

1636
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:57,979
It's a party.

1637
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,730
Fucking-A, right.

1638
01:19:59,772 --> 01:20:00,791
I'm staying, I'm
fucking staying,

1639
01:20:00,815 --> 01:20:01,816
we're gonna have a party.

1640
01:20:03,568 --> 01:20:04,819
- Okay, kids.

1641
01:20:04,861 --> 01:20:06,404
Why don't we go
into the front yard.

1642
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:07,172
- Come on, let's celebrate.

1643
01:20:07,196 --> 01:20:07,905
Hey, hey.

1644
01:20:07,947 --> 01:20:09,115
Gimme a beer.

1645
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,575
Gimme a beer.

1646
01:20:10,616 --> 01:20:11,534
Where's the candles?

1647
01:20:12,743 --> 01:20:14,162
Bring the cake!

1648
01:20:14,203 --> 01:20:16,205
Don't be a fucking bitch!

1649
01:20:16,247 --> 01:20:18,499
I'm trying to have a good
fucking time, are you?

1650
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:20,710
- Maxie, everything okay?

1651
01:20:20,751 --> 01:20:22,503
- [laughs] Great.

1652
01:20:24,589 --> 01:20:27,800
Oh, look who just decided
to show up and play daddy-o.

1653
01:20:27,842 --> 01:20:30,136
- Well, you know
about that, don't you?

1654
01:20:30,178 --> 01:20:31,345
- Max, please, go inside.

1655
01:20:31,387 --> 01:20:32,555
We're fine.
- Yeah, yeah.

1656
01:20:32,597 --> 01:20:34,473
You better get your
old ass back inside.

1657
01:20:34,515 --> 01:20:35,600
Hmm?

1658
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:38,060
- Look, you can see
Ezra another time.

1659
01:20:39,687 --> 01:20:41,606
- Oh, now you're
trying to tell me

1660
01:20:41,647 --> 01:20:44,400
when I can and can't
see my son, is that it?

1661
01:20:44,442 --> 01:20:45,752
What are you gonna do
about it, tough guy?

1662
01:20:45,776 --> 01:20:47,486
Huh?

1663
01:20:47,528 --> 01:20:48,237
- Look at him.

1664
01:20:49,322 --> 01:20:50,531
He's embarrassed.

1665
01:20:51,824 --> 01:20:54,035
Be smart for once in
your fucking life.

1666
01:20:55,828 --> 01:20:58,497
- You better get your ass back
inside before you get hurt.

1667
01:21:01,834 --> 01:21:04,045
- I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

1668
01:21:05,087 --> 01:21:06,547
- Or what?

1669
01:21:06,589 --> 01:21:08,883
- Tyler, you know
me, you know I'm not

1670
01:21:08,925 --> 01:21:10,593
a fucking around kind of guy.

1671
01:21:11,928 --> 01:21:14,013
[Tyler chuckling]

1672
01:21:14,055 --> 01:21:15,598
[Tyler grunts]

1673
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,766
- Tyler!

1674
01:21:16,807 --> 01:21:19,560
[Tyler grunting]

1675
01:21:25,691 --> 01:21:26,567
Dad!

1676
01:21:26,609 --> 01:21:27,568
Stop it!

1677
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:31,072
Ezra!

1678
01:21:31,113 --> 01:21:32,657
[Ezra gasping]

1679
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:36,035
[tense music]

1680
01:21:36,077 --> 01:21:36,738
It's okay.

1681
01:21:38,162 --> 01:21:41,123
[Tyler groaning]

1682
01:21:41,165 --> 01:21:42,250
Get away from him!

1683
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,542
All of you!

1684
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:44,293
Go!

1685
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,099
It's okay, baby.

1686
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,517
It's okay.

1687
01:21:59,558 --> 01:22:00,685
I got you.

1688
01:22:00,726 --> 01:22:01,727
It's okay.

1689
01:22:04,313 --> 01:22:07,566
[soft keyboard music]

1690
01:22:19,203 --> 01:22:21,580
[Maxine sighs]

1691
01:22:23,708 --> 01:22:26,627
- Was that a birthday party
or was that a birthday party?

1692
01:22:26,669 --> 01:22:28,170
- Jesus Christ.

1693
01:22:28,212 --> 01:22:30,423
This fucking family.

1694
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:34,093
[both laughing]

1695
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,723
- I get it, Mom.

1696
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:42,393
Dad's a drug addict.

1697
01:22:44,687 --> 01:22:46,605
And a very angry
man, by the way.

1698
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:51,819
- I don't know how you do it.

1699
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:53,654
You are an amazing kid.

1700
01:22:56,449 --> 01:22:57,241
- How do you think?

1701
01:22:58,534 --> 01:22:59,243
It's you.

1702
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:08,753
[gentle music]

1703
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:11,213
How's Grandpa?

1704
01:23:14,133 --> 01:23:16,302
- I don't know.

1705
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:17,720
I should go check.

1706
01:23:23,934 --> 01:23:24,727
- I love you, Mom.

1707
01:23:26,187 --> 01:23:27,730
- I love you more.

1708
01:23:31,817 --> 01:23:33,652
- [Max] Ezra okay?

1709
01:23:33,694 --> 01:23:34,403
- Yeah.

1710
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:36,197
- I'm sorry, Maxie.

1711
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:37,448
I lost it.

1712
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,033
- Yeah, story of your life.

1713
01:23:40,743 --> 01:23:42,244
- He'll hurt that boy one day.

1714
01:23:43,204 --> 01:23:44,747
You too.

1715
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:45,974
- That doesn't
give you the right

1716
01:23:45,998 --> 01:23:47,225
to beat the shit out of
him right in front of Ezra.

1717
01:23:47,249 --> 01:23:49,460
- I behaved like a pig.

1718
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:50,586
You deserve better.

1719
01:23:56,592 --> 01:24:00,221
- Does the pig need a lift
to his appointment tomorrow?

1720
01:24:00,262 --> 01:24:02,431
- No, no, no, Hank's got me.

1721
01:24:07,895 --> 01:24:08,896
Maxie.

1722
01:24:13,776 --> 01:24:15,861
I just want to
thank you for this.

1723
01:24:19,824 --> 01:24:20,825
For all of it.

1724
01:24:33,504 --> 01:24:35,923
[solemn music]

1725
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:47,494
- [Doctor] Max, let's talk.

1726
01:24:47,518 --> 01:24:49,603
- You were right about the pain.

1727
01:24:49,645 --> 01:24:50,521
What do you think?

1728
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:52,857
Too late for treatment?

1729
01:24:54,525 --> 01:24:55,818
- [Doctor] Normally,
I'd say yes,

1730
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,736
but you're a tough
son of a bitch.

1731
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:04,034
- What kind of time
am I looking at?

1732
01:25:05,578 --> 01:25:06,996
- [Doctor] It's hard to say.

1733
01:25:07,037 --> 01:25:08,873
Maybe an extra month.

1734
01:25:08,914 --> 01:25:10,234
Why don't you think
about it, Max?

1735
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:13,996
At least let me write you a
prescription for the pain.

1736
01:25:20,759 --> 01:25:22,553
[knocking on door]

1737
01:25:22,595 --> 01:25:23,888
- Get that, would you?

1738
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:25,556
- [Ezra] I'm brushing my teeth!

1739
01:25:27,475 --> 01:25:30,060
- Is there any chance we
won't be late one day?

1740
01:25:30,102 --> 01:25:30,982
- [Ezra] Probably not.

1741
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:38,545
- What are you gonna do, Maxie?

1742
01:25:38,569 --> 01:25:39,361
- Stop it, Tyler!

1743
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:41,780
Stop!
- Let me in.

1744
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:43,073
Let me fucking in!

1745
01:25:54,585 --> 01:25:55,336
- Do me a favor.

1746
01:25:56,629 --> 01:25:57,421
When I'm gone...

1747
01:25:59,131 --> 01:26:00,011
- You're not gone yet.

1748
01:26:01,926 --> 01:26:05,804
- When I'm gone, pop in from
time to time, check up on them.

1749
01:26:07,723 --> 01:26:09,934
Maybe hire Ezra part-time.

1750
01:26:13,729 --> 01:26:14,438
- Okay.

1751
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:20,736
- How bad was I?

1752
01:26:22,947 --> 01:26:23,864
- What do you mean?

1753
01:26:23,906 --> 01:26:26,825
- I mean, how bad was I?

1754
01:26:28,452 --> 01:26:29,203
The truth.

1755
01:26:30,913 --> 01:26:35,042
My head's so fogged up, I don't
know up from down anymore.

1756
01:26:36,043 --> 01:26:37,044
So.

1757
01:26:39,463 --> 01:26:40,756
- You were bad, Max.

1758
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:47,429
Ain't nobody around to
tell how bad you were.

1759
01:26:50,432 --> 01:26:53,143
I'm sorry, but you
wanted the truth.

1760
01:27:05,614 --> 01:27:08,075
[engine starts]

1761
01:27:11,829 --> 01:27:16,500
[baby crying] [dogs barking]

1762
01:27:17,918 --> 01:27:19,128
- Maxie?

1763
01:27:19,169 --> 01:27:19,878
Ezra?

1764
01:27:23,882 --> 01:27:24,883
Maxie?

1765
