00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,867
We are not leaving!

2
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,269
- Mni Wiconi!
<i>- Water is life!</i>

3
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,640
<i>I want to make sure that</i>

4
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,710
both sides are refraining
from situations

5
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:50,545
<i>that might result in</i>
<i>people being hurt.</i>

6
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,795
<i>As we reported</i>
<i>last week,</i>

7
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,564
<i>a protest in North Dakota</i>

8
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,365
<i>against a major oil pipeline</i>

9
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>continues to grow.</i>

10
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,236
<i>Over 100 Native American</i>
<i>tribes have joined the fight</i>

11
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,437
<i>against the project,</i>

12
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,575
<i>saying that it threatens</i>
<i>one tribe's water supply</i>

13
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,542
<i>and its sacred lands.</i>

14
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,877
Oh, my God, we
should send a selfie to Mike.

15
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,582
Oh wait,
let's take one more.

16
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,250
One more, okay.

17
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,463
15 dollars
and 30 cents, please.

18
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,568
]

19
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,905
Hurry up!

20
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:48,596
Come on.

21
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,230
Are you sure you
should be doing this?

22
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:54,502
Why? Am I the only
female in human history

23
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,803
to want to nest
while she's pregnant?

24
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:57,972
Why isn't Dan doing this?

25
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,841
I don't know,
why don't you ask him?

26
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,409
We know how that would go.

27
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,645
I'm exhausted.

28
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,883
How's it going with him?

29
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,586
Eh.

30
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,889
He's got his good days
and bad days.

31
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:19,259
<i>I think he's in complete denial</i>
<i>that this baby is coming.</i>

32
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,866
Hey.

33
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,004
Okay, so his income
last year was 19,000 dollars,

34
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,372
his wife's pregnant,

35
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,009
<i>his car was recently</i>
<i>repossessed by the bank,</i>

36
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,844
<i>and his credit score,</i>

37
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:38,813
<i>438.</i>

38
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,848
And he's a Republican.

39
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,518
<i>Yeah, he's perfect.</i>

40
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,354
<i>Every dad's in</i>
<i>denial before the baby comes.</i>

41
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,690
<i>Yeah, but he</i>
<i>won't even touch me.</i>

42
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,528
You know, sometimes
I feel her kicking at night,

43
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,363
and I ask him to put
his hand on my belly

44
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,832
and he's too scared to touch it.

45
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,867
<i>Oh, Jules,</i>

46
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,837
<i>you got this.</i>

47
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,706
And that's my cue.

48
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,011
I'm gonna see
you tomorrow, right?

49
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,579
Yeah, unless
you're giving birth.

50
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,881
Thanks.

51
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,116
You're not scraping
anything tomorrow.

52
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,984
You better help out more.

53
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,619
I'll bring beer.

54
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,592
-Hi.
-Hey, Sam.

55
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,993
Need a hand?

56
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,595
Uh...

57
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,596
No, I think I got it, thanks.

58
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,831
Dan.

59
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,033
She needs you,

60
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,604
and that baby's
gonna need you, too.

61
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,006
I got it, thanks.

62
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,510
Hey.

63
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,578
Hi.

64
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,783
Did Sam help or...

65
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,117
just talk?

66
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,026
Well, I'll tell you what,
you got this.

67
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,360
I gotta go get some pages done.

68
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,598
Okay, well we need to
do the nursery today.

69
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,600
I know.

70
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,402
But I'm behind and I have
to get some pages out.

71
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,470
Fine.

72
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,808
Thank you.

Oh, hi.
My name is Ricky Scott,

110
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,768
I'm with the <i>Houston Daily</i> .

111
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,036
How you doing?

112
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,104
The <i>Houston Daily</i> ?

113
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,942
Dan, we really like that
<i>Associated Press</i> piece you did

114
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,711
for the Cleveland Refinery,

115
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,113
and I need something
similar on an oil pipeline

116
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,549
that's getting some
resistance in North Dakota.

117
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,517
And I think that you have
the right perspective.

118
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,221
Okay.

119
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,090
The media is all over

120
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,192
this Native American
protest up there

121
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,828
and we need a no BS
profile on that pipeline.

much of an inconvenience

00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,814
to get you on a plane
tomorrow morning at six AM.

130
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,917
What's the pay again?

131
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:40,221
Did they say
how they found you?

132
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,257
My Cleveland Refinery piece.

133
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,558
Hmm.

00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,094
Hey, have you seen

135
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,330
No, not for a while.

136
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,898

-Okay.

137
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,199
Hey, get the list.

138
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,100

140
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,142
What do you got?

141
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,978
Sam and I are gonna
go to the thrift store

142
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,346
and see what we can
find on this list.

143
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,747
But,

144
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,049
even that...

145
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,251
Okay well,

146
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,255
they said they'd wire the
first payment tomorrow, so.

147
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,691
Promise me you'll...

148
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,693

149
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,166
Come back.

150
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,077

160
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:33,934
- Hello.
- Hi.

161
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,341
Sorry, it's a little tight.

162
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,210
Yeah, it's just
a little smaller

163
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,981
than I'm accustomed to.

164
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:47,982
You sure it's gonna fly?

165
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,151
Yeah.

166
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:55,189
You know, the commercial
airport in Bismark's a mess,

167
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,257
thanks to the protesters.

168
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,460
But I'm coming in
from Pennsylvania.

169
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,928
It's an easy stop over

170
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,229
and we could get some
work done on the way.

171
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,298
Okay, good.

172
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,768
You know we had a little
weather coming in, so...

173
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,004
it might get bumpy.

174
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:17,745
You religious?

175
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,880
When necessary.

176
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,348
That's good.

177
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,251
Hope we don't need it.

178
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:35,564
Rough flight?

179
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:38,098
There was a little turbulence.

180
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,701
Here you go.

181
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,206
Dan, I'd like you to
meet a couple people.

182
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,107
This is Sheriff Glasser.

183
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,243
Sheriff.

184
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,912
And Marty Sherman. He heads up
the private security for us.

185
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:52,846
How you doing, Marty?

186
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,150
Are those...

187
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,053
These are all
non-lethal firearms,

188
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,821
they fire rubber bullets.

189
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:01,855
You wanna try one?

190
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,124
The bullet or the gun?

191
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,895
Well, if you need
anything while you're here,

192
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,163
these are the guys to talk to.

193
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,865
-Okay.
-Alright, we should get going.

194
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,068
Alright, nice meeting you.

195
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,202
Hope you don't get car sick.

196
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,108
I'll pick you up
first thing in the morning.

197
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:21,976
Alright, thanks.

198
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,311
Listen, Elliot,

199
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,047
what exactly is it that you do?

200
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,117
I connect people.

201
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,219
I help people.

202
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,324
The pipeline company
is my client,

203
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,194
but right now my
job is to help you

204
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,530
tell the best story you can.

205
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,899
And what story is that?

206
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,369
Whatever you write,
whatever you see.

207
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:52,406
Okay.

208
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,245
You know, we're a lot more
alike than you might think, Dan.

209
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,347
How's that?

210
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,215
Marine Corps.

211
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,151
Spent some time in Afghanistan,

212
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,422
some other operations.

213
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,028
After I got out, I still
wanted to serve my country.

214
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,232
Helping get the
oil pipelines built?

215
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,000
Absolutely.

216
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,270
America doesn't
run on fairy dust.

217
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,072
That's true.

218
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,409
Can't tell some people that.

219
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,377
Not California.

220
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,946
Don't get me started.

221
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,261
<i>...large oil pipeline,</i>

222
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,930
<i>which will run through</i>
<i>several states when completed,</i>

223
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,534

224
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,102

225
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,538

<i>whether construction will be</i>

227
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,041
<i>permanently halted</i>
<i>on the pipeline.</i>

228
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,415
What's this?

229
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,218
Welcome to the circus.

230
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,656
Grab your camera, do your thing.

231
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,924
I'll circle around and
meet you on the other side.

232
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:21,395
Okay.

233
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,131
For the children!

234
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,165
Come on. It'll be fun.

235
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,601
Yeah. No, no, no.

236
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,203
-All over it.
-Alright.

237
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,138
For our brothers!

238
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,574
- We stand!
- We stand!

239
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,208
- We stand!
- We stand!

240
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,976
- For our sisters!
- For our sisters!

241
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,512
- We stand!
- We stand!

242
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,480
- For our brothers!
- For our brothers!

243
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,048
- We stand!
- We stand!

244
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,916
- For the earth!
- For the earth!

245
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,251
- We stand!
- We stand!

246
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,953
For the water!

247
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,020
For the water!

248
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,956
- We stand!
- For our sisters!

249
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,592
We stand!

250
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,393
- We stand!
- For our brothers!

251
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,061
- For our brothers!
- We stand!

252
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,663
- We stand!
- For water!

253
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,599
- For water!
- We stand!

254
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:59,166
- For water!
- For water!

255
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,135
- We stand!
- Put that camera down.

256
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,070
What do you think
you're doing here, man?

257
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,073
You think this is
entertainment?

258
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,675
We're protecting your water,

259
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,678
after your people
stole our land.

260
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:12,346
So put the camera down
and come join the real fight.

261
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:15,683
Stand up and fight!

262
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:04,431
Dan. Dan. Dan? Dan!

263
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,433
Dan McKinney! Are you with me?

264
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,538
Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:12,339
Good.

266
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,608
Alright. Come on.
The truck's right over here.

267
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:15,510
Yeah.

268
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,045
Yeah.

269
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,647
Yeah.

270
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:27,387
Sure you're up for this?

271
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,592
Yeah. Yeah.
Must be something I ate.

272
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:32,727
I'm good.

273
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,238
Dan!

274
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,440
Bob will answer any
questions you have.

275
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,275
-Great.
-Nothing's off limits.

276
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,612
-Is that true?
-It's what he says.

277
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,145
Scary thing to
say to a reporter.

278
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,313
It can be.

279
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,381
Hey!

280
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,620
That'll move 500,000 gallons
a day once we're running.

281
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,120
- 500?
- That's right.

282
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,488
Can I get a photo?
Is that alright?

283
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:02,624
-Yeah, of course.
-Alright.

284
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,024
Let's get a photo of you.

285
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,793
You're looking good, Bob.

286
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,629
I'll be right here
if you need anything.

287
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:09,396
Okay. That's good. Thanks.

288
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,699
Bob, these workers,

289
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,835
they free for me to ask
them a couple questions?

290
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,603
- One of them?
- Yeah, sure. Hey, Frank!

291
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:19,574
It's not a cushy job
for them, is it?

292
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,376
Well, the boys
show up with nothing.

293
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,512
I mean, we give them a room,
something to eat,

294
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,380
they walk away with good money.

295
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,649
Some of 'em don't want to go.

296
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,651
-Really?
-Frank, meet Dan.

297
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,719
-He's doing a write up on us.
-How you doing?

298
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,287
Yeah, doing good.
How about yourself?

299
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,522
Nice to meet you.

300
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:35,790
He'd like to
ask you a few questions

301
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,491
-if you don't mind.
-Sure.

302
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,061
-You don't mind taking a break?
-Oh, no, not at all.

303
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:45,165
<i>How was your oil transported</i>

304
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,199
<i>before the pipeline?</i>

305
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,402
By train.

306
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,405
But, we had an oil train
headed to Tacoma catch fire

307
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,472
about a month ago.

308
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,476
The pipeline is
safer for everyone.

309
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,213
So you don't agree with
the protesters, I take it?

310
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,617
Let me put it to you
this way.

311
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,552
How'd they all get here?

312
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,822
Last I checked, America
still runs on oil.

313
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,324
Thanks.

314
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,562
Have you had any trouble?

315
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:15,730
With the protesters.

316
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:18,533
Off the record?

317
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,368
Yeah, you have my word.

318
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,572
We've had some trouble
with some of the workers

319
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:25,873
and some of the native women.

320
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,810
You should do some research.

321
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:49,731
What you got there?

322
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,637
- A memento.
- Must be your lucky day.

323
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,471
Yeah, I guess so.

324
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,239
Too bad you can't keep it.

325
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:00,908
Yeah.

326
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,442
You could actually keep it.

327
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,778
It's private land here,

328
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,445
but once we get
on the reservation

329
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,681
you're gonna have to leave it.

330
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:07,915
Okay.

331
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:08,783
You hungry?

332
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,919
Unfortunately, yeah.

333
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,559
I'm really glad
you're here, Dan.

334
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,830
I mean, the pipeline has
just been getting hammered

335
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:24,532
in the media.

336
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,933
Yeah, well, I mean, you didn't
expect chocolate and roses,

337
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,669
did you?

338
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:31,304
No, but I also didn't expect
a bunch of radical activists

339
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,407
to come and start provoking
the First Nation people.

340
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,743
That's what they
like to be called.

341
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:39,547
You know,
transporting oil is risky.

342
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,551
The question is, how do
you minimize the risk?

343
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,953
Are you asking
the mainstream media?

344
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:47,421
'Cause they got an answer.

345
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,389
Wind, solar, electric car.

346
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:50,591
Right now.

347
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,359
Maybe a time machine?

348
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,494
- Time machine.
- So we can go ahead 50 years

349
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,863
when we don't need oil anymore.

350
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:56,964
Yeah.

351
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,399
Pipelines are
safer than trains.

352
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,603
And both are safer than
not having enough oil.

353
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,339
In Iraq, what did
you see more of?

354
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:09,911
Weapons of mass
destruction or oil fields?

355
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,212
-Come on.
-Yeah.

356
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,683
So how many Iraq's
is it gonna take for us

357
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,350
to run this country?

358
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:19,754
More than a few.

359
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:20,621
Yeah.

360
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:24,659
You know,
with the tar sands up north,

361
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,494
and the shale in this country,

362
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,998
we have enough oil
to last a century.

363
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,634
-A century?
-Yeah.

364
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,937
But it's useless if
we can't move it.

365
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:43,745
You're with me, aren't you, Dan?

366
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,649
Well, I'm here writing
the story, aren't I?

367
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,417
Yeah.

368
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,521
I mean, I use as much
oil as anybody else.

369
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,558
And I know we can't turn
off the spigot right now,

370
00:20:58,693 --> 00:20:59,594
but I'll be happy when we can.

371
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,294
I'll put it that way.

372
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,797
- Agreed.
- Okay.

373
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,666
Ah, thank you.

374
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:08,803
Is there anything
else you might need?

375
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,437
No, we're great. Thanks.

376
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,742
<i>The pipeline's original path</i>

377
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,010
<i>crossed the Missouri River</i>

378
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:19,514
<i>just north of Bismarck,</i>
<i>a city that is 90% white.</i>

379
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,082
<i>But when concerns were raised</i>

380
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:23,017
<i>about a potential</i>
<i>oil spill there,</i>

381
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,485
<i>the pipeline was</i>
<i>rerouted south--</i>

382
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,954
-Hello?
<i>-...to go under the river</i>

383
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:29,090
<i>right next to</i>
<i>the Standing Rock reservation.</i>

384
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:31,324
Ah, Yes, Dr. Lombard,
that was me.

385
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,360
Uh shoot.

386
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,096
It's just my wife
calling through,

387
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,864
I'll call her back.
What's up?

388
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:38,733
<i>10 days ago,</i>
<i>the tribe submitted evidence</i>

389
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,735
<i>of newly discovered</i>
<i>artifacts in burial sites--</i>

390
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:42,870
-Really?
<i>-...asking a state court</i>

391
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:43,738
<i>for an emergency injunction.</i>

392
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,340
<i>But, before the court</i>
<i>could make a decision,</i>

393
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,943
<i>bulldozers started</i>
<i>digging in that area.</i>

394
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,713
Water is life!
Water is life!

395
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:55,448
Water is life! Water is life!

396
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,350
Stand back! Stand back!

397
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,053
You're all about to dig
on ancient burial ground!

398
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,656
All of this and all of you,

399
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,625
are in violation of
US Archaeological Law

400
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,728
and the Fort Laramie Treaties
upheld by the US Supreme Court.

401
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,965
We are your brothers
and your sisters.

402
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,432
We want peace!

403
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,803
Think about who will profit
from your actions.

404
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:17,138
Not your families.

405
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,573
Three, two--

406
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,776
Behind me,
pipeline security and police

407
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,579
are blocking
Native American protesters

408
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,848
for trying to protect
what they claim to be

409
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:28,816
is ancient burial ground.

410
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,419
A company who will
pollute your drinking water!

411
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,655
Leave this sacred land.

412
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,029
- Oh my lord.
- This is crazy.

413
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:44,397
-Was Dan there?
-I don't know.

414
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,967
I haven't heard from
him for a few days.

415
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,502
-You don't know if he's okay?
-No, I don't know.

416
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:49,837
I left him messages and texted

417
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:51,038
and he texted me back

418
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,007
saying that they
had bad reception.

419
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,680
Marty.

420
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,515
Great, bud, thanks for coming.

421
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,518
-You remember Marty Sherman?
-Marty.

422
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:05,853
-Head of security.
-Dan.

423
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:07,454
You met him first
day in the hangar.

424
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,388
Yes, good to see you again.

425
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,825
Alright.

426
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,027
He's just gonna ask
you a few questions.

427
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,195
Alright.

428
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,429
Noticed your
accent the other day.

429
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,832
You don't mind me
asking, where you from?

430
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:19,734
Biloxi, Mississippi.

431
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:24,205
Gulf Coast. You got some
good seafood down there.

432
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,673
Yes, sir.

433
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:26,941
I've been shrimping
since I was a kid.

434
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:28,976
Heck, I cook a mean gumbo.

435
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,077
Yeah, I believe you.

436
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,513
It's been a long day for us.

437
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,682
If you don't mind,
we're just gonna jump in.

438
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:35,950
- Marty, is that alright?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,151
Um...

440
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:41,055
Elliot told me about
the bulldozer incident.

441
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,623
Can you tell me a
little bit about that?

442
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:43,591
I understand you were there.

443
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:44,659
Uh, yeah.

444
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,729
Bunch of protesters got
upset about the bulldozer

445
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,932
and they gathered
down on the fence

446
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:52,600
on the company's land.

447
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,835
So they were trespassing,
gathering on the company's land?

448
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:59,006
Well, more like the road,
but yes sir.

449
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,474
And as soon as
we started digging,

450
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,210
they came across that
fence like crazy people.

451
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:04,979
They were firing arrows

452
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:06,714
and throwing pieces
of pipe and stuff.

453
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:08,749
Arrows like,

454
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,551
like shooting bows and arrows?

455
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,522
Yeah. I mean,
I know it sounds crazy,

456
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:18,092
but they had all kinds
of Indian feathers on

457
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,161
and they were
drummin', hollerin',

458
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:22,462
and they were screaming all
kinds of war chants, too.

459
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,532
They were really riled up.

460
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:26,233
What do you think
got 'em so riled up?

461
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,911
<i>They said that we were</i>
<i>digging up some old grave site,</i>

462
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:38,913
but we did surveys.

463
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,614
And there are
no bodies buried there.

464
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,791
<i>Do you have any photos</i>

465
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:52,860
<i>or video or anything</i>
<i>of the incident?</i>

466
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,095
<i>Be good to include</i>
<i>in the piece.</i>

467
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:59,133
I think we were all
a little bit too focused

468
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,201
on doing our jobs.

469
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,903
This operation is behind
schedule big time.

470
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,140
I just want to add

471
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,111
that I don't have anything
personal against them Indians,

472
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:14,548
<i>but you know, they just</i>
<i>gotta let bygones be bygones.</i>

473
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,117
All that stuff happened
hundreds of years ago.

474
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,719
And we just all
need to get along.

475
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,621
Thanks, Marty.

476
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,261
<i>Let me ask you,</i>

477
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:29,663
<i>the work you're doing,</i>

478
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:31,899
<i>you and your guys with</i>
<i>the sheriff's department,</i>

479
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:33,901
to what degree is it
a coordinated effort?

480
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,103
You know, Dan, that's a,

481
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,072
that's an excellent question.
Uh.

482
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:42,176
They're just both providing
tactical support to each other,

483
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,079
so this whole situation
with the protesters

484
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:48,015
doesn't get more outta
control than it already is.

485
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,017
Keep 'em in line.
Thanks a lot, Marty.

486
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:51,585
You've been really helpful.

487
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,220
Let's get you back to the hotel.

488
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:55,623
-Okay. Thank you Marty.
-Yes, sir.

489
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,058
-Nice to see you again.
-Good to see you.

490
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,894
You know, they prefer to
be called First Nation People

491
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:03,597
or the Sioux Tribe.

492
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,533
- Sioux Tribe?
- Yeah, it's just

493
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,634
- a matter of respect.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,835
- Thanks again, Marty.
- Thank you.

495
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,819
<i>Dan, the article is great.</i>

496
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,120
<i>Front page.</i>

497
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:28,289
Now listen, call me ASAP.

498
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,024
I have something else for you.

499
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:37,865
<i>Dan,</i>
<i>I've left you two messages.</i>

500
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:40,101
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Please call me back.</i>

501
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,305
<i>We watched that crazy video.</i>

502
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:47,741
<i>Please,</i>
<i>let me know you're okay.</i>

503
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:50,344
<i>Please call me back.</i>

504
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:53,147
<i>Bye.</i>

505
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,692
Yeah, we're supposed
to be leaving now.

506
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,962
You know what?
My mom did it on her own

507
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,230
and we kind of turned out okay.

508
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,100
<i>Are you still there?</i>

509
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,103
Hi.

510
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,104
<i>Julie, are you okay?</i>

511
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,207
Hi.

512
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:24,879
I called you.

513
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:29,116
I kept calling you
and texting you,

514
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,085
and you never got
back to me. Why?

515
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:38,926
What is wrong with you?

516
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:41,061
I'm your fucking wife!

517
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:44,798
I don't--

518
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,069
We have class right now.

519
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,142
Are you coming?

520
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,146
Yes, of course.

521
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,905
I can't believe
you took a call,

522
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:27,308
a phone call, in the
middle of birthing class.

523
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,143
It was important, Julie.

524
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:30,744
More important than our baby?

525
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,014
I couldn't just ignore it.

526
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,284
Since when don't you
know how to ignore a call?

527
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,423
The paper wants me
back on the next flight.

528
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:43,991
Tonight.

529
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:50,331
Well, the paper is
not having your baby.

530
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,198
I am.

531
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,904
And you, you're just
somewhere else all the time.

532
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:58,939
And I don't mean
writing your article.

533
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,445
I put together a crib today.

534
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,282
Look at me.
I shouldn't be doing that.

535
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:11,485
We need the money, Julie.

536
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:15,557
They're doubling the pay.

537
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,491
Fine. Go.

538
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,961
You should go. It'll be good.

539
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:23,831
Come on.

540
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:26,133
I need a break.

Some of them came all
the way from New York.

00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:22,349
Well, maybe
they shouldn't have.

572
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:28,155
Just give us a key to

00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:50,444
I'm a journalist.

584
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:57,418
Mr. McKinney,

585
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,553
Thank you.

Listen,

587
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,493
if your friends want to
take a shower in my room,

588
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:08,630
they can.

589
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,365
If you're quick about it,
I'm exhausted, I gotta sleep.

590
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,536
Well, what do you say, guys?

591
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,703
You wanna take charity
showers from Houston here?

592
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:19,239
At this point I would take
a shower from the Devil.

593
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,156
So.

594
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:39,493
So?

595
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:46,701

596
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,072

you got that look.

597
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,075
Julie. And what's "the look"?

598
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,514

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,956
Yeah, I am searching
for something, but...

601
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,357

602
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,359

exactly?

679
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:56,944
Yeah, no problem, man.

680
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:58,646
You know, they're just
suspicious of potential,

681
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,515
you know, infiltrators.

682
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:02,016
But, hey, I gotta jet.

683
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,551
See you later, brother.

684
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:15,797
Hey, sorry I'm late.

685
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,535
What's wrong?

686
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:24,739
Promise me...

687
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,374
you won't mention
this to anyone.

688
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:29,777
Anyone.

689
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,513
Yeah.

690
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:35,415
So newbies, here's the deal.

691
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:38,886
This is a nonviolent,
direct action protest.

692
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:42,023
Emphasis on nonviolent. Clear?

693
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:46,794
Our council elders had a call

694
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:49,063
with our lawyers in
Washington, DC last night.

695
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:55,002
They cannot stop the pipeline.

696
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:58,573
So raise your hand
if you've ever been

697
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,473
on the front lines of
a direct action before.

698
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,713
Okay, This is for all of
you, but especially you.

699
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,483
Under no circumstances
do you throw anything

700
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,920
at pipeline security
or a policeman.

701
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:17,357
And do not provoke them
in any way whatsoever.

702
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,727
Is that clear?

703
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,928
Okay.

704
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:22,930
So, we're on the front lines

705
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,733
and somebody grabs you.

706
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,535
What's the first
thing that you do?

707
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,638
Ask somebody for help?

708
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:35,076
No, you need to throw your
camera to somebody on our side.

709
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:37,444
You need to protect the truth.

710
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:40,915
You have a responsibility
to tell the truth

711
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:42,650
about what's going on here.

712
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:45,820
You are responsible.

713
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:48,923
Each and every one of you.

714
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,126
<i>Ch'unkshi.</i>

715
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:56,063
Strong warriors...

716
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:00,568
never stand down.

717
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:04,872
Even in the face of defeat.

718
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:17,985
Mary, it's your turn.

719
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,453
<i>Toksa.</i>

720
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:25,693
I am here to welcome you

721
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:29,597
to the land of my ancestors
and the coming generations

722
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,498
of the Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux.

723
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,602
This is Sacred Land.

724
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,806
This whole camp is
a prayer ceremony.

725
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:46,914
I am asking you to honor
and respect our cultures

726
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,481
and our traditions.

727
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:57,124
Now, if you agree to this,
raise your hands.

728
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:03,798
<i>Oh'a</i> . Good.

729
00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:07,868
How 'bout we do a quick
review of The Black Snake.

730
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,240
Based on previous
catastrophic leaks,

731
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:15,276
the most likely future leaks

732
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:17,144
are going to be right here

733
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:18,145
and right here.

734
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:21,716
<i>When that does happen,</i>

735
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:27,922
it could possibly poison
the water supply for

736
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,058
maybe 10 or 20 million people.

737
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,261
That is why you are here.

738
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,798
<i>You are the water protectors.</i>

739
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:40,968
<i>Mni Wiconi.</i>

740
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:43,838
Water is life.

741
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:49,276
Alright, Marion's gonna give you
your volunteer assignments.

742
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,746
Do you mind,
can I take a photo of that?

743
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,214
Be my guest.

744
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,784
Okay.

745
00:41:57,752 --> 00:42:01,555
Uh, Bill and Roger,
you're on chopping wood.

746
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:04,959
Brandy and Alexa, you are
helping in the medic tent.

747
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,928
And you, Dan, you're on dishes.

748
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:10,264
Which actually starts
in 10 minutes, so.

749
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,601
Sorry. Wait, wait, sorry.

750
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,704
The journalists are--
are--are expected

751
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:17,838
to volunteer at the camp?

752
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,776
Yeah, it's kind of the thing.

753
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,946
Do you need help
finding the mess tent?

754
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:29,884
Ladies?

755
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,119
Do you think one of you could
show him where the mess tent is?

756
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,355
Yeah, fine, I'll babysit.

757
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:35,222
Come on.

758
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:54,909
<i>Washte.</i>

759
00:42:58,946 --> 00:42:59,980
<i>Washte.</i>

760
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:05,119
All these people
were just moved here.

761
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:13,828
Well, I hope you're not
allergic to hard work, Houston.

762
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,298
So it's just right over there.

763
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:19,166
Okay.

Sorry, what?

766
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:25,973
It's our way of
saying farewell.

767
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:27,641
It means later again.

768
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:30,845
I like that. Took-shack?

769
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:32,346

770

<i>-Toksa akhe.</i>

771
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:36,684
-In a sacred hoop they roamed.
<i>-Toksa akhe.</i>

772
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,818
<i>- Toksa akhe.</i>

00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:42,890
Their flesh,
their hide, their bone.

775
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:46,894
To the north, south,
east, and west,

776
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:49,096
you could hear their stampede.

777
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:52,066
We are the <i>tatanka</i> .

778
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:55,236
Our skin, our blood, our creed.

779
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:03,210
Uh, hello again.

780
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:05,646
You hungry?

781
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:08,349
Uh, you know, I don't think so.

782
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:10,351
But I'm ready to do
some dish washing.

783
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:13,120
<i>Oh'a.</i>

784
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,089
This way.

785
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:26,700
Hey. Terry, Navy.

786
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:29,103
Dan, Army.

787
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:32,940
You just get here?

788
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,010
Yeah, more or less.
What gave me away?

789
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:38,212
You looked like
you just woke up, homes.

790
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:42,349
Yeah, well, guess it's
not what I thought it'd be.

791
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,285
What'd you expect?

792
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:46,420
Bunch of Indians on horses
shooting bow and arrows?

793
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,056
Yeah, maybe.

794
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,258
Probably too many
westerns as a kid.

795
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,693
Yeah, well,

796
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,196
there's some young people
here who want to fight, but

797
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,899
most of us know that
fighting won't get you too far.

798
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:02,336
We gotta be peaceful
on this.

799
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:05,239
The Black Snake is a sign
that it's time for us all to

800
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,974
come together.

801
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:09,043
What's The Black Snake?

802
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,313
The Black Snake,
the oil pipeline.

803
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:14,848
Predicting prophecy
for generations.

804
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,018
When the black snake
crosses the land,

805
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:20,120
a time of great
trouble will begin.

806
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:24,024
What kind of great trouble?

807
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:26,927
Let's just say
it won't be good.

808
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:38,973
<i>Andy from Truth Riot here.</i>

809

It's not right.

818
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,929
There is legal precedent
to stop this pipeline.

819
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:04,465
The Historic Preservation Act
protects the site,

820
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:07,134
as does the US Constitution.

Alright.

827
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,949
Hi. Excuse me.
You're an attorney?

828
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:23,217
Yes. And you are?

829
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,952
Dan McKinney, journalist.

830
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,487
What did you mean
the land is

831
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,122
protected by
the US Constitution?

832
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:29,524
You know, I gotta run, but...

833
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,594
I'll tell you what,
you come by my room

834
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:34,028
in an hour,
I'll explain it to you.

-Okay. Where?
-203.

836
00:46:35,996 --> 00:46:38,032
Alright. Thank you.

837
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:38,899
Hello?

838
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:56,083
<i>Oh, hey. Yeah, come on in.</i>

839
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:58,452
Make yourself a place to
sit there. I'm on the phone.

840
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:01,922
Right.

841
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,191
You heard what I said, right?

842
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:07,027
No.

843
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:10,331
Okay. I want you to get
a title search going.

844
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,600
I want you to find
out who owns the land

845
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,401
and then I want you to
get back to me, alright?

846
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:17,171
No, I'm not mad.

847
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:18,238
Alright.

848
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:20,240
Alright.

849
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,309
Okay.
Thank you, bye.

850
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:25,479
Busy night?

851
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:28,882
The pipelines have hired
private security thugs

852
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,251
that just bag anybody
that they deem a threat.

853
00:47:33,555 --> 00:47:36,423
What are these
treaty lands here?

854
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:37,925
Alright, well,

855
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:40,094
the part in yellow...

856
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:45,299
there, that was granted

857
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:47,301
<i>as part of the</i>
<i>Fort Laramie Treaties</i>

858
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,069
<i>with the federal government.</i>

859
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:51,338
<i>Now there were two.</i>
<i>There was one in 1851</i>

860
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:54,408
<i>and one in 1868.</i>

861
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:56,310
But downstairs,

862
00:47:57,612 --> 00:47:59,413
you said protected
by the Constitution.

863
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:00,280
Yes.

864
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:07,454
Okay, this is Article VI
of the US Constitution.

865
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:09,591
Read the underlined bit.

866
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:18,298
"This Constitution...
and all treaties made,

867
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,934
or which shall be made,

868
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:23,036
under the Authority
of the United States,

869
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:26,641
shall be the supreme
Law of the Land."

870
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,677
In other words, the founding
fathers included these treaties

871
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:32,580
because they wanted these
land deals to be honored.

872
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:34,549
Everything you see there,

873
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:36,518
on that map,

874
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,686
legally belongs to
the Sioux Nation.

875
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:45,058
These treaties,

876
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:47,394
and they're still valid?

877
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:50,197
Supreme Court, 1980,

878
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,300
the <i>Sioux Nation v</i>
<i>the United States</i> ruled

879
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,969
that the land was
illegally taken

880
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:57,971
from the Sioux by
the US government.

881
00:48:58,005 --> 00:48:58,640
1980?

882
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:03,043
So if that's correct,
the pipeline--

883
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,212
Crosses Sioux treaty land.

884
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,981
And not just that pipeline,

885
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:11,619
but a lot of oil, gas,
uranium operations.

886
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,220
What do you think?

887
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:16,223
Do you think these companies
want to go to federal court?

888
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:21,596
Ah, duty calls.

889
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,567
Hello? Yeah.

890
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,501
Um, okay. Yeah, we can do that.

891
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:29,303
We can go over the deposition.

892
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,573
Yes. I know it's serious.

893
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:32,439
Hold on.

894
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:36,176
It's good to meet you.

895
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,377
Thank you.

896
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:39,346
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

897
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:52,660
<i>Hey, buddy, it's Elliot.</i>

898
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,394
Uh, again.

899
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:55,996
<i>I left you a message.</i>
<i>Give me a buzz.</i>

900
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:19,453
Huh, you're alive.

901
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:23,758
Hi.

902
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,226
<i>Hi.</i>

903
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:29,731
How are you?

904
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:33,668
I'm still pregnant.

905
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:38,272
It's feeling really real now,

906
00:50:38,305 --> 00:50:43,043
with the little bath
and bottles and toys.

907
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:46,313
Jules.

908
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,181
<i>Hmm?</i>

909
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:49,249
I'm...

910
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,687
<i>sorry I left the way I did.</i>

911
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:56,123
Dan,

912
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:58,492
<i>are you okay?</i>

913
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,829
Yeah.

914
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:02,697
Yeah. I just,

915
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:06,534
<i>actually, I just miss you.</i>

916
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,409
<i>- </i> <i>When are you done?</i>
- Shouldn't be long.

917
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,411
I just need to move to
the camp for a few days.

918
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:19,514
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Wait, what? Seriously?

919
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:21,816
You said, you promised.

920
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,250
<i>I saw those videos.</i>

921
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,285
You promised me that you
would not put yourself

922
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:26,453
in harm's way.

923
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,356
<i>How many episodes have</i>
<i>you had this month, Dan?</i>

924
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,096
How long have you known?

925
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:40,635
I gotta go.

926
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,880
Dan the man!

927
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:55,182
Awesome that you're joining
us on this historic day.

928
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:55,817
Hey, Fish.

929
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:58,753
Can I give
you a hand with that?

930
00:51:58,786 --> 00:51:59,621
No, I got it.

931
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,626
Actually, yeah.

932
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:05,860
I'm not gonna say
no to some help.

933
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:06,728
I got you covered.

934
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,165
So with all these
vets coming through,

935
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,233
I bet you're getting pretty
stoked about your article.

936
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:16,704
Uh, yeah. You know,

937
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:20,207
I'm still...still looking for
the right perspective for it,

938
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,875
you know.

939
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:25,513
Oh, dude, I'm late.

940
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:29,684
I gotta go. I'll see you at
the Forgiveness Ceremony?

941
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:33,420
Uh, yeah, that's--
Wait, that's today?

942
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,523
Four PM tonight, man.
Do not miss it.

943
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:37,290
History is being made tonight.

944
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:38,392
Okay. Got it.

945
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:39,459
Alright.

946
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,730
-Okay.
-Thanks.

947
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,532
-I'll see you tonight, man.
-Thanks.

948
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:55,175
<i>Hau, Mitakuye Oyasin.</i>

949
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:59,781
In the sacred hoop of life,

950
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:04,652
there is no beginning
and no ending.

951
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:12,593
Our prophecies tell us that
we are now at a crossroads.

952
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:16,664
We must unite spiritually,

953
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:20,500
or we will face chaos.

954
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:32,714
We came.

955
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:35,817
We fought you.

956
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,220
We took your land.

957
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,791
We signed treaties
that we broke.

958
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:47,762
We took your children.

959
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,333
We have come to say
that we are sorry,

960
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:57,638
and we are at your service,

961
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:01,743
and we beg you for
your forgiveness.

962
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:40,948
<i>Oh'a.</i>

963
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:11,879
Howdy, Houston.

964
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:17,885
A little jumpy, aren't you?

965
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:19,053
Where'd you come from?

966
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:19,921
Oh, the sky.

967
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,024
No, I was just...

968
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:26,594
lost in the landscape, it's...

969
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:29,730
I could see how

970
00:55:31,098 --> 00:55:32,432
you'd wanna fight for this.

971
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,337
You wanna see what's
really going on?

972
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:40,942
Meaning?

973
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,012
Midnight.

974
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:47,347
Just you.

975
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:49,884
No camera.

976
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,855
Okay.

977
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,890
-Alright?
-Alright.

978
00:55:57,859 --> 00:55:58,893
See you, Houston.

979
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:00,761
See ya.

980
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:11,906
This could take a while.

981
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:19,881
What's your story?

982
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:22,617
I told you mine.

983
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:26,954
Yeah, a version of your story.

984
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,625
Okay, tell me
a version of yours.

985
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:37,965
Uh, my reservation
is a ways away, but...

986
00:56:39,734 --> 00:56:42,069
when I heard they moved the
pipeline to cross here I said

987
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:45,840
I would do whatever it took
to stop The Black Snake.

988
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,943
Kissed my kids and husband--

989
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:50,144
Wait, you're a mom?

990
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,480
Yeah.

991
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,984
And I just got in the car
and I drove here.

992
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:01,989
How long ago was that?

993
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:04,825
About six months ago.

994
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:11,666
Since you got here have
you had any problems or...

995
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,568
run-ins...

996
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:15,937
with the private security or...

997
00:57:17,138 --> 00:57:17,972
police?

998
00:57:21,776 --> 00:57:22,944
Sorry, didn't mean to pry.

999
00:57:26,647 --> 00:57:27,715
Two weeks ago,

1000
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:32,186
water protectors
had formed a line in

1001
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:34,789
the pipeline's path so.

1002
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:37,959
And the sheriff's
department arrived and...

1003
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,931
They shot a percussion grenade
and hit a kid in the leg.

1004
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:46,934
And then,

1005
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:48,970
they grabbed an elder
and began beating her.

1006
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:51,906
And they beat us,

1007
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:56,911
zip tied us and took us to a
hill overlooking construction.

1008
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:04,018
And for hours, they made
us watch bulldozers destroy

1009
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:07,922
our burial grounds.

1010
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:16,263
They took us to this,
like a huge garage,

1011
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:19,900
and inside were dog kennels.

1012
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,771
And they wrote on
us with Sharpies.

1013
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:26,007
With Sharpies.

1014
00:58:28,976 --> 00:58:30,811
I was number 236.

1015
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:35,216
And then they put us
in those kennels.

1016
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:39,086
Like dogs.

1017
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:43,090
I'm so sorry.

1018
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:47,261
Did you know that

1019
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:50,664
if a non-Native commits
a crime on the reservation,

1020
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:52,199
we can't prosecute?

1021
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:57,271
<i>So we get all these</i>
<i>construction camps,</i>

1022
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:59,140
<i>oil workers.</i>

1023
00:59:03,778 --> 00:59:05,980
Well, you can just about imagine
what they do to our women.

1024
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:31,806
There's the snake.

1025
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:43,717
It loos so different.

1026
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,153
Compared to what?

1027
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,924
There's a lot more
military vehicles.

1028
00:59:52,293 --> 00:59:53,994
We gotta go tell
the council ASAP.

1029
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,710
<i>Where did you find this again?</i>

1030
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,312
At a pipeline
construction site

1031
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:12,813
near the Standing Rock
Reservation,

1032
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:13,681
in the Dakotas.

1033
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:16,851
Strange.

1034
01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:18,052
<i>Why's that?</i>

1035
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,653
Construction
companies are required

1036
01:00:19,687 --> 01:00:21,422
to do archaeological surveys.

1037
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:24,925
Usually a find this rare
would be with other artifacts.

1038
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:27,828
Like in a burial ground?

1039
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:29,230
<i>Certainly that's one option.</i>

1040
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:30,931
And how old is it?

1041
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,200
Around 1,500 years old.

1042
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:35,436
You're kidding me.

1043
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,971
We had the lab carbon date it.

1044
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:39,140
It is an important find.

1045
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:42,243
Any chance we could
come down there

1046
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:43,711
and do a proper survey
of the area?

1047
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:45,746
I seriously doubt it.

1048
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:48,249
Listen, I gotta run.

1049
01:00:48,282 --> 01:00:50,084
Can you email me a copy
of that lab report?

1050
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:53,387
Actually, I'm required to
send the artifact back to you

1051
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,055
and I'll include
the report with it.

1052
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:57,324
Okay, great. Thank you.

1053
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:01,695
Offenses include attacking a
police helicopter with drones,

1054
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,064
unlawful use of weapons,

1055
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:07,234
unlawful creation of explosives,

1056
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:09,937
and establishing an
illegal roadblock.

1057
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:15,009
The various activities
resulted in 127 new arrests.

1058
01:01:17,178 --> 01:01:20,147
What's been the cost of this
operation to the taxpayers?

1059
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:23,217
We're estimating upwards
of 10 million dollars.

1060
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,253
Sheriff, are you aware of
the influx of US veterans

1061
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:27,221
joining the water protectors?

1062
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:31,125
Yes. We're aware of them.

1063
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:33,260
Many of our veterans are very,

1064
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:37,364
very vulnerable to exploitation.

1065
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:39,166
We just...

1066
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,368
strongly discourage our

1067
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:45,272
returning soldiers from
misinterpreting the situation.

1068
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:47,808
So are you saying
that they're incapable

1069
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,276
of interpreting it correctly?

1070
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:53,981
This is a very
emotional situation.

1071
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,983
It's very easy to get confused.

1072
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,952
At the end of the day,

1073
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,988
we're simply here to
protect and serve the law.

1074
01:02:01,422 --> 01:02:02,756
Sorry, sheriff, uh,

1075
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,225
the law?

1076
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:07,494
The Sioux Nation has appealed

1077
01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:09,763
the federal government's
violation of land treaties.

1078
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:12,399
Shouldn't the construction
be suspended

1079
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:14,001
until that matter is resolved?

1080
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,339
To the best of my knowledge,

1081
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,341
all the work has
been sanctioned.

1082
01:02:21,342 --> 01:02:23,777
If we're told otherwise,
by the courts,

1083
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:26,313
we'll take appropriate action.

1084
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,787
You're a hard man
to get a hold of.

1085
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:38,325
Well, I've been focused
on the story.

1086
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,328
Well, it looks like
it's going great.

1087
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:45,132
I don't like
being manipulated.

1088
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:47,968
<i>They've invented a story</i>

1089
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:50,971
<i>about crazed protesters</i>
<i>and weapons in camp</i>

1090
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:53,073
<i>and propane tank explosives.</i>

1091
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:55,342
<i>They have</i>
<i>legitimate evidence</i>

1092
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:57,344
<i>for everything on that list.</i>

1093
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:00,180
Forensic, drone footage.
This is serious, Dan.

1094
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:02,416
<i>Look, they wanna</i>
<i>charge the protesters, great.</i>

1095
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:05,019
<i>Do it.</i>
<i>But do it legitimately.</i>

1096
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,354
<i>You know what's legitimate?</i>

1097
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:09,456
<i>Our right to build there.</i>

1098
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:14,128
This is a nation of laws.

1099
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:16,598
And the law's on our side
when it comes to this.

1100
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:18,299
The law says these
people get screwed.

1101
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,568
The tribe's known
about this for two years.

1102
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:22,403
400 meetings.

1103
01:03:22,436 --> 01:03:24,405
Do you know how many
comments we got back?

1104
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:25,507
Two.

1105
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,174
They didn't care.

1106
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:29,209
Where's the oil going, Elliot?

1107
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:31,579
It's not going to
US consumers, is it?

1108
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:33,447
It's all going overseas.

1109
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,483
Competing with OPEC
is national security.

1110
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:38,586
We're about to be

1111
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,921
a net exporter

1112
01:03:40,954 --> 01:03:44,024
of oil and gas for
the first time in decades.

1113
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:47,027
That is energy independence.

1114
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:47,895
And at what cost?

1115
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:50,130
Where are you going?

1116
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,901
I was hired to find
out what's going on.

1117
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:56,937
No, no, you were hired
by us to write a story.

1118
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,239
I was hired to find
out what's going on.

1119
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:00,474
You moved the pipeline

1120
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:02,176
right to the mouth
of the reservation

1121
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:03,511
under the widest
point of the river

1122
01:04:03,545 --> 01:04:05,312
at their only water source.

1123
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:08,583
We destroyed their past.

1124
01:04:10,618 --> 01:04:12,219
But you're destroying
their future.

1125
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:22,463
- Yeah?
<i>- I need to know.</i>

1126
01:04:22,496 --> 01:04:23,931
Is he a liability?

1127
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:26,467
Yeah, he's a problem.

1128
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,303
He's off the reservation.

1129
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:33,240
<i>That's not funny, Elliot.</i>

1130
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:34,241
No, I know it's not funny.

1131
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:36,477
These articles are
now being reviewed

1132
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:38,245
by the State Department.

1133
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:41,148
They're calling it an
issue of national security.

1134
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:43,951
We can't have him
turning the tables on us.

1135
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:07,307
Hi, Terry. What's up?

1136
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:10,177
They know who you are, Dan.

1137
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:14,047
-And they want to meet with you.
-Okay.

1138
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,417
Before we go in there,
let me just explain--

1139
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,452
They wanna meet with you now,
<i>iktómi.</i>

1140
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:21,321
You gotta come with us.
<i>Hiyupo.</i>

1141
01:05:40,742 --> 01:05:42,242
We all gotta face our demons.

1142
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:56,089
Sit down.

1143
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:06,967
We take infiltrators
seriously.

1144
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:13,040
I understand.
Please, just let me explain--

1145
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:14,341
Who wrote this article?

1146
01:06:18,078 --> 01:06:19,446
That was before
I knew any of you.

1147
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:23,217
Did you write it or not?

1148
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,319
Will you please let me
explain what I'm--

1149
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:28,121
Oh yes, please explain
to the poor Natives.

1150
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:31,124
How stupid do you think we are?

1151
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:35,195
Did you really think that
you could live with us,

1152
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:36,664
eat with us, pray with us,

1153
01:06:36,698 --> 01:06:38,365
and we would never
figure out who you were

1154
01:06:38,398 --> 01:06:39,567
or what you were doing?

1155
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,105
The first piece,
I wrote for <i>The Daily</i> , yes.

1156
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:47,509
I toured the pipeline facility.

1157
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:49,744
Yes, and I saw what
they wanted me to,

1158
01:06:49,777 --> 01:06:51,613
and I wrote pretty much
what they wanted me to.

1159
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:56,316
But then they sent me back here.

1160
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:00,555
And I see things
differently this time.

1161
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,323
I do.

1162
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,160
And I'm trying to
tell the truth.

1163
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:10,497
I'm trying to help.

1164
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:14,301
There is somebody
that you helped.

1165
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:18,773
Chetan's been arrested
for that drone flight.

1166
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:26,246
That's not even--
but how's that possible?

1167
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,048
Hey, Mika,

1168
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:30,284
something's going
down at the bridge.

1169
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:31,118
They need you now.

1170
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:32,520
<i>Inahni yo!</i>

1171
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:37,592
<i>Oh'a, iktómi.</i>

1172
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:45,800
<i>Oh'a, iktómi.</i>

1173
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:47,535
Tricky Spider.

1174
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:50,203
Traitor.

1175
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:52,740
Pack your things.

1176
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:56,476
<i>Shots fired! Shots fired!</i>

1177
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,829
<i>You don't care</i>
<i>about the truth, Ricky.</i>

1178
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:16,631
<i>You're just in this</i>
<i>to make a buck.</i>

1179
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:19,534
How 'bout putting yourself
in my shoes for a moment?

1180
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:22,202
87 soldiers from

1181
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,640
Houston alone have died
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

1182
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,508
<i>Oh, come on, Ricky.</i>

1183
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:29,176
Including my nephew.

1184
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:32,714
Truth is, down the road,

1185
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:36,116
15 people died trying
to refine that oil

1186
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:40,555
<i>and 23 more before that.</i>

1187
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:45,827
<i>The truth is,</i>

1188
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,595
<i>what kind of fuel</i>
<i>is in your car?</i>

1189
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:50,130
How much fuel did
you burn this year?

1190
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:52,834
This month, this week?

1191
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:54,602
<i>Give me a break, Ricky.</i>

1192
01:08:55,937 --> 01:08:57,805
There are two sides
to every story.

1193
01:08:58,472 --> 01:08:59,674
The side you see

1194
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:01,241
and the side you don't.

1195
01:09:01,274 --> 01:09:02,777
And it is my job

1196
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,579
to show you
the alternative side.

1197
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:29,269
Damn it!

1198
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:50,257
Water is life! Water is life!

1199
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:35,603
Water is life! Water is life!

1200
01:10:35,636 --> 01:10:37,972
Water is life! Water is life!

1201
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,608
Water is life! Water is life!

1202
01:10:45,012 --> 01:10:47,615
Water is life! Water is life!

1203
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:49,917
Water is life! Water is life!

1204
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,693
Water is life! Water is life!

1205
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:01,596
Water is life! Water is life!

1206
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:37,799
What are you doing?

1207
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:41,002
Are you trying to kill us?

1208
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:46,373
We came here to peacefully pray.

1209
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:50,044
Water is life!

1210
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:55,016
Water is life! Water is life!
Water is life! Water is life!

1211
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:57,585
Water is life! Water is life!

1212
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:50,197
<i>And for hours they made</i>
<i>us watch bulldozers destroy</i>

1213
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,968
<i>our burial grounds.</i>

1214
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,010
<i>You're with me,</i>
<i>aren't you, Dan?</i>

1215
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,953
<i>Come back.</i>

1216
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,635
<i>All this stuff happened</i>
<i>hundreds of years ago.</i>

1217
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:31,906
<i>We just all need to get along.</i>

1218
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:35,910
<i>We all gotta</i>
<i>face our demons.</i>

1219
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:44,752
<i>A time of</i>
<i>great trouble will begin.</i>

1220
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:48,622
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>it won't be good.</i>

1221
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:41,368
This is for you.

1222
01:17:09,263 --> 01:17:10,764
This is for you.
