he was the chief bodyguard
for the Barzani warlords...

feared throughout the region.

He was involved in all sorts
of trouble from gun running
to smuggling, you name it.

552

I mean, the people back there
still call him by his tribal
moniker, "The Fierce One".

working over?

Now, after the North
was liberated...

00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:07,683
Bin Amed got a job working
for a contractor as a driver

him a work permit here in the
