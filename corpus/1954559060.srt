1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,493
? Don't you know
that I love you ?

2
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,537
Ha ha ha!

3
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,303
<i>It's gold, just like they said.</i>

4
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,707
Yes, sir!

5
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,642
<i>Gold, gold! Ha ha!</i>

6
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,112
<i>Really, really fine.</i>

7
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:51,139
Well, I must admit,
you boys got a lot of nerve...

8
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:53,980
pulling a mining robbery
like that.

9
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:56,486
In broad daylight, no less!

10
00:00:57,921 --> 00:01:01,322
Yeah, shooting up
all them good white folks.

11
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:04,794
Well, it comes with
the territory.

12
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:08,092
Ha ha! Well, gentlemen...

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,622
I'm prepared to go
10,000 apiece.

14
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,793
- What?
- What you talking, $10,000?

15
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:18,898
No, we agreed.
$200,000 on delivery.

16
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,499
It seems to me
things have changed.

17
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:26,673
Right now, this ore is hotter
than Memphis in July.

18
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:29,876
Now, you boys got to
turn it into cold cash.

19
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,975
There's only two people
who can do that...

20
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:33,314
and I'm one of them.

21
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:35,149
I suggest you take my offer.

22
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:38,020
Lester, you trying to cheat us,
you cheap bastard.

23
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,856
Hush up, baby girl.
I'll handle this.

24
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:46,761
You're trying to cheat us,
you dirty bastard...

25
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,390
and I'm very disappointed
in you.

26
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:53,027
Well, boy, I'll tell you,
take it or leave it.

27
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:56,094
<i>? Hold you I love you ?</i>

28
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:04,534
It ain't gonna go
this way, Lester.

29
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,240
You think about it again.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,374
<i>Drop your hands!
Drop your damn hands!</i>

31
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,848
- Get your hands down!
- Move over! Move over!

32
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,319
<i>That's right.</i>

33
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:18,619
I don't do business with niggers
who pull guns on me.

34
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:22,560
Lester, baby...

35
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:26,086
you gone and picked
the wrong niggers...

36
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,258
to call niggers.

37
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:40,132
What the hell is
that thing on your nose?

38
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:44,704
It's distracting.
Ought to be removed.

39
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:49,012
My man Jodie here,
he's an expert cosmic surgeon.

40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,711
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah!

41
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,082
Ain't you, Jodie?

42
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:57,580
Oh, yeah! I-I-let me
have a look-see, Slim.

43
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,082
Oh, that's dog ugly.

44
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,958
- Ugly!
- Ugly, mm-hmm!

45
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:07,728
- Lester, it's gotta go.
- Gotta go.

46
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:08,892
Nurse...

47
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:11,767
No killing, Slim.

48
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:14,795
<i>Who's the other fence, Lester?</i>

49
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,806
<i>Uh...</i>

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,774
Pop go the weasel.

51
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:21,471
Aah!
You niggers rot in hell!

52
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:25,743
Doctor, I think you ought
to sterilize that wound.

53
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,215
<i>Don't use that acid, Slim!</i>

54
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,081
Go on around.

55
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:36,181
No! No! It's Easy Money
up in Harlem!

56
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:39,751
Easy Money?
The dude that own the Royale?

57
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,353
That's him! I swear!
Get that acid away from my face!

58
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:45,331
Bo! Get our shit
and get the hell outta here.

59
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:47,855
Come on, y'all, let's go.

60
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,701
- Slim...
- What?

61
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,501
You're gonna kill him,
ain't you?

62
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,508
Go help Bo.

63
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,169
You promised me no more killing!

64
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,611
Get the hell outta here.
Always got to run your mouth!

65
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,412
Come on, Hank.

66
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:12,319
Let's see if we can fry him
like a pork chop.

67
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:13,549
- Burn him!
- Ha ha ha!

68
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:21,656
<i>Lester, you're gonna
look like sloppy chitlins.</i>

69
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:22,822
Jodie!

70
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:26,061
- It's the sheriff!
- You set us up!

71
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,399
Y'all got ten seconds
to get your ass out here!

72
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,630
Fire!

73
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,237
<i>God damn it, it's Lester!</i>

74
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,674
Shoot the bastards!

75
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,173
Aah!

76
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:45,012
<i>Imabelle!</i>

77
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:49,879
Aah!

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,148
Fuck you, nigger!

79
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,657
- Aaah!
- Back up!

80
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:10,737
<i>Stop her! No!
Don't let her get away!</i>

81
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:11,137
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

82
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,984
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

83
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:16,080
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

84
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:18,283
Help me, somebody. Mmm!

85
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:20,292
<i>Christy, you forgot
your Hula-Hoop!</i>

86
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,886
Young and tender inspiration!

87
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,292
<i>Dirty old man.</i>

88
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,991
<i>Damn shame.
? Give to the blind ?</i>

89
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,865
<i>? Give to the blind ?</i>

90
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,176
Lord...

91
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,549
thank you for letting me
wake up in my right mind.

92
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,328
Lord...

93
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:11,700
last night
after depositing $4.25..

94
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,172
Of my hard-earned money
into my bank account...

95
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:18,903
I passed the $1,500 mark...

96
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:25,142
my new balance
now being $1,500.25.

97
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:28,912
Thank you for
making me provident...

98
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:32,148
and for not putting
obstacles in my way.

99
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:36,021
Such as... women.

100
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,719
Amen.

101
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,557
And they snatched her purse
right off her arm.

102
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:46,826
Lord have mercy.

103
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,391
I don't know what's wrong
with these children today.

104
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:52,097
Nothing that a good ass-kicking
wouldn't help.

105
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:53,297
You go right ahead.

106
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:56,796
Thank you, honey.
You got manners to spare.

107
00:08:56,842 --> 00:09:00,403
His mama
really raised him right.

108
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:02,708
Well, I hope he enjoyed himself.

109
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:07,308
She probably the only woman
he'll ever have.

110
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,875
Sorry. All full up.

111
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:18,592
As salaam alaikum, my brother.

112
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:21,425
What are you
saying to me, Claude X?

113
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,896
You speak English to me.
You just say hello.

114
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,229
Hell is low, brother man.

115
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:29,668
That's much better,
and very true.

116
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:33,537
<i>Rodney, meet me over on 110!</i>

117
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,576
- Jackson!
- You're late!

118
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,109
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:50,518
- Jackson!
- Yes, sir?

120
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:53,785
- You're late!
- I'm sorry. I just-

121
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:54,984
I know, I know.

122
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:57,288
Next time get on the bus,
no matter what!

123
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,691
We got dead people
to tend to here.

124
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,161
You think
they gonna wait on you?

125
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:02,926
<i>Oh, no, sir.</i>

126
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,197
<i>? Ooh, ooh, ooh ?</i>

127
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:09,931
Shake it!
I'm ready to go!

128
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,565
- Ohh...
- Hey, Goldy.

129
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,302
Say, Goldy!

130
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:18,709
<i>? Just yesterday
skies were cloudy and gray ?</i>

131
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:21,475
You must be some kind of
mathematical genius...

132
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,539
keeping all those numbers
in your head.

133
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,015
Well, you know how it is.

134
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,245
Notepads look too much
like evidence.

135
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:29,720
Yeah, well,
I'm very disturbed...

136
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,087
that one of your people
hit for ten grand.

137
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,715
It ruined my weekend, Goldy.

138
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,918
What can I say?

139
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,586
Old man Dixon's
been playing for years.

140
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:39,152
- He never won a dime.
- Yeah.

141
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:42,529
Suppose we just say
you remembered wrong.

142
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,227
You see, I hear he's due...

143
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:47,030
to take a little fall
down a flight of stairs.

144
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,506
You want to chump on the rest
of your people, you do that...

145
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,302
but anybody bets with me
gets paid.

146
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,206
<i>You understand what I'm saying?</i>

147
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,340
What's the matter
with this guy?

148
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:00,107
How come you always
looking to try me?

149
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm gonna try you again.

150
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,772
You ain't gonna try me now.

151
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,580
Goldy, Goldy...

152
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:08,985
Hey, my friend...

153
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:11,046
I'll let Dixon off this time.

154
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,149
<i>But it's the principle
of the thing.</i>

155
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:16,683
I got one rule in life...

156
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:20,289
don't give nothing to nobody.

157
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,099
Take it easy, my man.

158
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,067
Drive. Come on.

159
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,107
<i>Mm-mmm!</i>

160
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:40,376
Yum yum yum yum yum.

161
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:43,941
<i>Yum Yum Yum yum!
Mmm! Pow!</i>

162
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,793
Put it in for me, honey.

163
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,060
Whenever, wherever, and however.

164
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,129
- Uhh!
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,602
- Hey, Charlie!
- Yeah?

166
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,505
- Give me a hand, huh?
- Oh, all right.

167
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,456
Yaah! Jackson!
Ha ha ha!

168
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,363
You boys quit messing
with the corpses!

169
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,457
I ain't joking around,
you know!

170
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,263
Yes, Mr. Clay.

171
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,769
You getting ready for
the Undertaker's Ball tonight?

172
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:44,894
We'll find you a woman.

173
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,496
I ain't got no time
for no women, Louis.

174
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,336
We'll fix you up
with Mr. Clay's wife.

175
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:52,104
The one with the big ass
like two glazed hams.

176
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:53,508
Philistines!

177
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,637
<i>She got big feet.
Cover a lot of ground.</i>

178
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,341
Blaspheming philistines!

179
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,747
Two big, luscious titties,
like two cassava melons.

180
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:02,581
Blaspheming
philistine heathens!

181
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:04,587
Man, I'm not from Philly!
Who you talking to?

182
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,145
- I told you that!
- Hey, come on, man!

183
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:10,386
Blaspheming philistine
sinning heathens.

184
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,888
Sorry, Mr. Clay.

185
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:33,887
I'm separated!
Up in a man's business!

186
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,490
Would you look at me?

187
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,059
$5.00 an hour,
20 for the night.

188
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,766
What is this, the Ritz?

189
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,536
This is New York City, honey.

190
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,270
People don't come here
to sleep.

191
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,074
<i>Hour's usually all they need.</i>

192
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:53,479
All I got
is $4.00 to my name.

193
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:56,950
Oh, yeah?
What's that shit on your finger?

194
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,975
This is my grandmama's ring.

195
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,682
It's going with me to my grave.

196
00:14:04,224 --> 00:14:06,522
All right,
you can keep your $4.00.

197
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,355
I got a room opening up.

198
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:10,520
Go on up and take a shower.

199
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,962
You know your best bet?
You should go on over...

200
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:14,898
to the Undertaker's Ball
at the Royale.

201
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:18,527
Royale? That's where
I was going anyway.

202
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,094
Well, good.
If anybody can raise the dead...

203
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:25,632
and make 'em pay their rent,
it's you.

204
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:30,339
Things don't work out,
you come on back home.

205
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:17,210
Ooh, yeah! Yeah!
Turn me, baby! Ooh!

206
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,982
<i>? Elevator operator ?</i>

207
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:22,684

208
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,750

<i>? Up and down, up and down ?</i>

216
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:45,969
- What'd she say?
- Yeah!

217
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,170
I tell you
what she said, right?

218
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,670
She says, "Smitty,
Smitty, come on over."

219
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,080
So I go over there, right?

220
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:55,107
Soon as I get to the house,
she got 12 kids, man!

221
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,643
- What?!
- Twelve ugly kids!

222
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:59,952
Every last one of 'em
looked like Dracula.

223
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,149
All right now!

224
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,555
<i>? Elevator operator ?</i>

225
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:04,958

<i>? I got to show you around ?</i>

230
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:17,063
<i>? Owww! ?</i>

231
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:23,667
Now, I take the 12 kids
that look like Dracula...

232
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,041
and put 'em in a room, right?

233
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,909
Let 'em watch some
of that "Andy 'n' Amos."

234
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,105
No, no. "Amos 'n' Andy."

235
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:31,172
Yeah, whatever it is.
Amos and... and... right.

236
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,241
So, I tip over
to her bedroom, right?

237
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,617
Man, I'm riding that coochie
like the Lone Ranger.

238
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:38,455
I got that Trigger thing
happening down there.

239
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,280
<i>Smitty, I don't got time...</i>

240
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:43,986
<i>for all your blaspheming
and your evil ways.</i>

241
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:45,995
I'm looking for Easy Money.

242
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,393
- Smitty...
- Ohh!

243
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,923
<i>I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</i>

244
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,435
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

245
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:59,031
Get your goddamn hands
off me, chump.

246
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:04,568
Trying to clean you off.

247
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,476
Excuse me, but...

248
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:09,243
- Do we know you?
- Not in this lifetime.

249
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:10,510
- Oh!
- Whoo!

250
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,414
<i>Hot damn!
I know that hurt you.</i>

251
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:13,748
It hurt you.

252
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:15,481
No, can't hurt nobody
who look like Nat Cole.

253
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,714
Shit.

254
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,552
You better get rid
of them shaving bumps.

255
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,751
Man, shut up,
you old bug-eyed...

256
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:26,620
<i>Yeah. Heh.
That's gold, all right.</i>

257
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:30,327
<i>Mmm. Mmm. That's good.</i>

258
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,097
But you're gonna have
to show me the rest of it...

259
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,164
before I show you the money.

260
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:40,902
<i>Now, honey, a whole lot
of people was killed...</i>

261
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,137
<i>playing around with this stuff.</i>

262
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:48,513
My partners,
white folks, police.

263
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:50,278
I ain't just
flashing it around...

264
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:51,909
and ending up the way they did.

265
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:54,579
You know, I do believe...

266
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:58,352
you and I were cut out
to do business together.

267
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,789
But first...

268
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:03,158
Yeah, baby?

269
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,316
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

270
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:08,557
Act calm.
Take it easy, baby.

271
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,126
<i>Their bark is bigger
than their bite.</i>

272
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,228
So, what you trying
to pin on me now?

273
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,239
Familiar with an old man
named Julius Dixon?

274
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:18,867
Hit for 10 grand on a number
Goldy sold him.

275
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:21,934
It warms my head
when I can do some good...

276
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,604
for the old folks
of the community.

277
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,614
Yeah? Too bad he fell
down a flight of stairs...

278
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,842
before you could pay him!

279
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:31,613
You don't think
we could do this later...

280
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,679
like in the morning?

281
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,280
- Hell no!
- Hell no!

282
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,118
<i>Don't worry, baby.</i>

283
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:45,688
They just do this shit
to keep themselves busy.

284
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:50,465
But, uh...
I got no place to stay.

285
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,963
Stay in a hotel.

286
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,875
But I got no money.

287
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,403
<i>? The people quit the scene ?</i>

288
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,087
<i>? Like the devil was loose ?</i>

289
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:06,100
<i>? The clouds turned green ?</i>

290
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:09,228
<i>? And letdown lemon juice ?</i>

291
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,260
<i>? What walks on two feet ?</i>

292
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,535
<i>? And looks like a goat? ?</i>

293
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:16,907
<i>? That crazy Screaming Jay
in a bright yellow coat ?</i>

294
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:18,205
<i>? Hey, now ?</i>

295
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,735
<i>? Stick With it ?</i>

296
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,477
<i>? Baby, baby,
don't you quit it ?</i>

297
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,882
<i>? Ohh, you're bound to get it ?</i>

298
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,886
<i>? Yes, sir ?</i>

299
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,080
<i>? Made outta goat skin,
foreskin ?</i>

300
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,920
<i>? And laying out
in milk and gin ?</i>

301
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,585
<i>? Lord, lord, lordy ?</i>

302
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,694
<i>? I took a plane out Midwest ?</i>

303
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,532
<i>? To see my Uncle Joe ?</i>

304
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,663
<i>? We ran into
some real bad weather ?</i>

305
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,866
<i>? Ice, rain, and snow ?</i>

306
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,898
<i>? Fifty million bulldogs ?</i>

307
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,375
<i>? Twenty mountain goats... ?</i>

308
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,276
Are you ready for me, daddy?

309
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:02,645
Oh, I'm sorry that
I spilled that water on you.

310
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:03,910
He spills a drink on me...

311
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:07,407
and now he won't even ask me
for a dance.

312
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,889
Boy ain't got no manners.

313
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:13,584
Well, honey,
you're just gonna have...

314
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,752
to make it up to me
on the dance floor, huh?

315
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:19,662
Would you hold
this for me, please?

316
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,924
Thank you.

317
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:23,762
I'm gonna hold this
for you, yeah.

318
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:29,464
Uh...

319
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:30,972
You're not an undertaker.

320
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:35,970
<i>? I put a spell on you ?</i>

321
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:40,713
I'm Jackson.

322
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:44,284
<i>? Because you're mine ?</i>

323
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:46,149
That's my toe, Jackson.

324
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:50,623
Sorry. I told you,
I don't know how to dance.

325
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,182
Baby, it's easy.

326
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:56,854
Just wrap your arms
around me...

327
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,557
<i>? Ha ha ha, watch out ?</i>

328
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,189
And squeeze.

329
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:02,426
<i>? I ain't lying ?</i>

330
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:07,366
<i>? Yeah ?</i>

331
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,669
I know who it is.
See, that's his cousin.

332
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,504
- Uh-uh.
- No, no.

333
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,510
Then that's...
Mr. Clay's in on this...

334
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:18,206
<i>that's his wife's
sister's daughter...</i>

335
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:20,010
- Uh-uh.
- No, no.

336
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:23,017
Then I do not know
who that woman is.

337
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,985
But...

338
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,588
<i>? Because ?</i>

339
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,992
<i>? You're mine ?</i>

340
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,291
Sorry.

341
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,859
And don't this feel good?

342
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,402
<i>- Whoo!
- Oh!</i>

343
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,532
Jackson, would you like
to go outside?

344
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:52,542
Because it's kinda hot in here.

345
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:55,272
Um, no. Uh...

346
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:59,008
Heh. I'm doing
just fine here, really.

347
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:01,312
Would you like to go home?

348
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:05,678
Really, don't worry about me.

349
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,951
I'm great.

350
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,117
Honey,
I ain't worried about you.

351
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:11,454
I'm worried about me.

352
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:14,325
See, I'm tired,
my feet are killing me...

353
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:16,193
and I just want to sit down.

354
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:17,719
Now, do you live nearby?

355
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:19,391
I'm sorry?

356
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:22,333
<i>? And I love you anyhow ?</i>

357
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,567
<i>? I don't care
if you don't want me ?</i>

358
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:28,038
<i>? I'm yours ?</i>

359
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:30,405
<i>? Right now ?</i>

360
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:33,103
<i>? I put a spell on you ?</i>

361
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,612
Let's go.

362
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,117
<i>? Because you're mine ?</i>

363
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,881
<i>? Mine, mine ?</i>

364
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,614
<i>? Ow, whoo ?</i>

365
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,179
<i>? Ooh, you're mine ?</i>

366
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:54,993
This is it.

367
00:22:57,398 --> 00:22:58,888
Upstairs.

368
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:04,233
Jackson, I told you
never to leave...

369
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:06,796
your ham-greased stuff
in my kitchen.

370
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,033
Who is that?

371
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:12,704
Well, you ain't been
fornicating all these years.

372
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:16,236
I don't see how come
you want to start now.

373
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,442
If Christ knew
what kind of Christians...

374
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,972
he had up here in Harlem...

375
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:22,918
he'd climb back up
on the cross and start over.

376
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:25,547
<i>Who's that?</i>

377
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:28,751
Why, that's Jesus.

378
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:33,794
Now, honey,
I know who Jesus is.

379
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,626
The other one.

380
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,894
<i>Oh. That's my mom.</i>

381
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,764
She's dead now.

382
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,032
Sorry to hear that, Jackson.

383
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:52,070
I'm so tired.

384
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:55,980
I feel like I walked
all the way from Mississippi.

385
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,144
Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,848
Would you like me
to rub your feet for you?

387
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,379
<i>I could do that for you.</i>

388
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,384
Sure, honey, that'd be fine.

389
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,526
Gotta take these off.

390
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:31,773
I've seen a lot of feet before.

391
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:35,373
I don't think
I've seen one... so small.

392
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:38,350
That's mighty sweet of you,
Jackson.

393
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:41,218
So, where is it
you seen all them feet?

394
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:42,949
Dead people.

395
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:44,979
Jackson.

396
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:46,786
Oh, you know...

397
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:48,986
<i>being an undertaker
and everything.</i>

398
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:51,120
<i>It's not that
I work with the deceased...</i>

399
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:53,630
or anything like that,
personally.

400
00:24:53,664 --> 00:24:56,497
<i>It's just... the job.</i>

401
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,161
You get accustomed
to the sight of bodies.

402
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,029
What I mean is...

403
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:12,074
Looking at bodies ain't so bad.

404
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:14,081
<i>That's not what
I'm trying to say, either.</i>

405
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,673
<i>What I'm trying to say...</i>

406
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,350
is...

407
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,185
You probably
ain't never seen a body.

408
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,985
Mm-mm.

409
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,460
Oh, they ain't so bad.

410
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,790
Actually, it's
a very exciting line of work.

411
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,590
Police! Get the hell
out of the way, suckers!

412
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:55,897
Don't make me kill nobody!

413
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:58,564
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

414
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,334
Goldy, my boy.

415
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:03,240
What's a nice guy like you
doing in a place like this?

416
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:06,268
I live here, Grave Digger.
Now get the fuck out!

417
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,404
<i>Two sluts cut up
a white cop last night.</i>

418
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:09,606
So what? What?

419
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,309
So the word is,
they come outta here.

420
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:12,611
You wouldn't
know nothing about that?

421
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,346
I don't know
nothing about nothing.

422
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:16,080
I suppose you don't know
nothing about some boys...

423
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,315
in Mississippi that shot up
a bunch of white folks...

424
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:20,653
and stole a trunk of gold?

425
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:23,592
What's that got to do with me?

426
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,116
Sooner or later,
it'll end up in Harlem.

427
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:26,890
Between you and Easy Money...

428
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,591
knowing everything
that comes in and out of here...

429
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,359
Gentlemen, you wouldn't
happen to have...

430
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,424
a search warrant, would you?

431
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:36,826
We don't need
a goddamn search warrant.

432
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:38,998
OK! All right!

433
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,803
We said we don't know
nothing about nothing.

434
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:42,309
Yeah!

435
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:46,107
You better watch
your ass, fruitcake.

436
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:50,480
Or we'll shut
this motherfucker down!

437
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,775
Let's go.

438
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,818
Someday, though.

439
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:04,227
Yeah, someday...
I'm gonna kick your ass.

440
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:07,992
<i>Try not to break
anything on the way out.</i>

441
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:09,362
Bastards.

442
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:12,526
Could've been worse.
Ha ha! OK, girls.

443
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:15,036
The fun is over.
Let's clean up this mess.

444
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,971
Come on, come on!

445
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,838
Did you hear what they said?
There's gold in Harlem!

446
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,740
Don't even think about it.

447
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:23,937
Shit, Kathy,
this could be it for me.

448
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:27,709
I get my hands on that gold...

449
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:29,978
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

450
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,506
I'll be careful.

451
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,143
Yes! I'll be careful!

452
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:35,552
<i>Ladies!
I'm coming back, ladies!</i>

453
00:27:35,588 --> 00:27:37,215
<i>Hey! I done told you...</i>

454
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,486
<i>a million times to keep
your behind off my stoop!</i>

455
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:48,630
What you doing?

456
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,998
Staring at you.

457
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:55,160
You've been there all night,
haven't you?

458
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:03,144
You covered me up?

459
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,043
<i>Yeah, it gets
so cold around here...</i>

460
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,310
<i>I didn't want you
to get sick or nothing.</i>

461
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:11,944
It's just that most men
would've uncovered me.

462
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:13,612
All of 'em, in fact.

463
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:17,784
What kind of man would do
something like that to you?

464
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:20,384
<i>That's not very nice.</i>

465
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:23,520
Where you staying, anyway?

466
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:27,491
<i>Do you have family around here?</i>

467
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,463
I sure had a fine time
last night, Jackson.

468
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,096
Me, too.

469
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:38,973
Thank you...
for covering me up and all.

470
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:43,037
Rubbing my feet and all.

471
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,707
Oh, it's no problem.

472
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:47,943
Really, it's no problem.

473
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:11,429
You a virgin, Jackson?

474
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,803
What you want to ask me
a question like that for?

475
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll take that as a yes.

476
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:20,134
I ain't no virgin.

477
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:23,045
Heh.

478
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,775
I could teach you.

479
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:26,646
I don't know.

480
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:30,813
You already taught me to dance
and all that stuff.

481
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,381
Wow.

482
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:51,864
<i>Come here, baby.</i>

483
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:00,669
Turn around.

484
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:09,051
Oh. That's OK.
I can do that.

485
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:27,227
Lay down, baby.

486
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:33,737
- Up here.
- Oh.

487
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:44,241
Do you mind if I take
these pictures off the wall?

488
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,617
- OK.
- OK.

489
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:14,833
Mm. What you trying
to do, baby?

490
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:23,712
I'm just... just...
taking my shoes off.

491
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,519
I'm sorry.

492
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,484
I'm so stupid. I don't...

493
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:39,189
I don't know how to do nothing.

494
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:45,993
Jackson.

495
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:49,995
It don't matter.

496
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,431
It really don't matter.

497
00:31:56,144 --> 00:32:00,808
It don't? Really?

498
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:05,013
Mm-mm. No.

499
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,016
<i>? Please, please,
please, please ?</i>

500
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:13,184
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

501
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:17,356

00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,694
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

503
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,632
<i>? Honey, please ?</i>

504
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,430
<i>? Don't ?</i>

505
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:26,095
<i>? Ohh ?</i>

506
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:27,729
<i>? Oh, yeah ?</i>

507
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,672
<i>? Whoa, I love you so ?</i>

508
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:33,835
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

509
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:37,244
<i>? Baby, you did me wrong ?</i>

510
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,679
<i>? You know you done me wrong ?</i>

511
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:41,842
<i>? Whoa, whoa ?</i>

512
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:43,647
<i>? You done me wrong ?</i>

513
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:46,779
<i>? You know you done me wrong ?</i>

514
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:50,518
<i>? You know you done,
done me wrong ?</i>

515
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:51,991
<i>? Whoa ?</i>

516
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:53,617
<i>? Oh, yeah ?</i>

517
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,720
<i>? Took my love,
and now you're gone ?</i>

518
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,958
<i>? Please, please, don't go ?</i>

519
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:00,590
<i>? Please ?</i>

520
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:03,830
<i>? Please, please, please ?</i>

521
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:06,770
<i>? Please, please ?</i>

522
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:08,294
<i>? Please ?</i>

523
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,102
<i>? Please ?</i>

524
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:14,104
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

525
00:33:14,144 --> 00:33:15,975
Mmm.

526
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:18,982
Will you marry me?

527
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:22,247
Marry me. Marry me.

528
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:25,083
Jackson...

529
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:27,248
don't you think that's
rushing things a little bit?

530
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,257
I mean...

531
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,851
Maybe we should just
try this out, you know?

532
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:35,886
Like for the weekend, huh?

533
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,192
Huh?

534
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,202
You mean, live together in sin?

535
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:46,535
Yeah. Why not? Hmm?

536
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,623
One, two... Uhh!!

537
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,654
Jackson, your decision
to liberate your hair from...

538
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,293
the influence of the white devil
is most encouraging.

539
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,064
Does that mean you're going
to liberate your mind as well?

540
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,537
No. It just means I'm going
to wear my hair natural now.

541
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:04,472
Woman sure has changed
you a lot in one week.

542
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:06,441
Morning, Mrs. Canfield.

543
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:08,137
This trunk is so heavy!

544
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,804
Stop complaining, Jackson.

545
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:11,642
If you knew anything
about women...

546
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,773
you'd know
you was getting off light.

547
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:17,013
- Hi, Mrs. Canfield.
- Huh!

548
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:18,780
I-I don't want
to complain or nothing...

549
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,788
Last night, you trying
to act like Samson.

550
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:23,757
Now I give you a chance to
prove it, and look how you act.

551
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,122
My good brother,
can you make it from here?

552
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,185
For I must prepare for mass.
As salaam alaikum.

553
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:33,096
Hey! I told you to just
say good-bye to me.

554
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:34,565
Just say good-bye.

555
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,329
It was awful nice
of him to help.

556
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,802
What kind of last name is "X"?

557
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:42,329
Oh, God, you're so innocent.
Ha ha ha!

558
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,069
It just fills my head with joy.

559
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:46,508
It's refreshing,
that's what it is.

560
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:51,037
His last name ain't
His last name is Taylor.

561
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:56,313
- Claude Taylor...
- Maybe that's why he changed it.

562
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:07,227
Oh... oh, baby!
They cut your throat!

563
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:12,289
And the trunk busted, and your
blood was all over the gold!

564
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:16,332
What gold?

565
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:21,836
It was just a dream.

566
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:26,236
I been wanting
to give you something.

567
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,738
Belonged to my mother.

568
00:35:31,783 --> 00:35:35,275
And I figure,
if you wear this...

569
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:38,446
it'll chase all of them
bad dreams away.

570
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,547
Ohh...

571
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:46,960
I can't take it.

572
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:48,929
It's yours.

573
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:09,312
<i>? May the Lord God
bless you real good ?</i>

574
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:14,341
<i>? May the Lord God
bless you real good ?</i>

575
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,546
<i>? Woke me up this morning ?</i>

576
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:18,054
<i>? Got me on my way ?</i>

577
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,719
<i>? May the Lord God
bless you real good ?</i>

578
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:24,283
Hallelujah!

579
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:27,953
<i>? Praise God on high ?</i>

580
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:31,227
<i>? It was a hot day
in Harlem, New York City ?</i>

581
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,631
<i>? City ?</i>

582
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:35,501
<i>? When Cain
went into the fields ?</i>

583
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:37,163
<i>? With his brother Abel ?</i>

584
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:38,729
<i>? Abel ?</i>

585
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:40,263
<i>? All right, and while Abel ?</i>

586
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:42,003
<i>? I said, while Abel ?</i>

587
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,704
<i>? Was tilling the soil ?</i>

588
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,507
<i>? Cain rose up ?</i>

589
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:49,037
<i>? He rose up
against his brother ?</i>

590
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,275
<i>? Oh, yes, he did ?</i>

591
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:52,546
<i>? He picked up that rock ?</i>

592
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,883
<i>? It was not
the rock of Jesus ?</i>

593
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,251
<i>? Jesus ?</i>

594
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:58,551
<i>? It was the rock of jealousy ?</i>

595
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,458
<i>? And Cain,
Cain took that rock ?</i>

596
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:03,620
<i>? He took that rock... ?</i>

597
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:31,315
<i>? Praise God, praise God ?</i>

598
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:34,320
<i>? Praise God, praise God ?</i>

599
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,885
Have a blessed week now.

600
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,453
God bless you now.

601
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,191
Have a blessed week.

602
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,165
- Jackson!
- Reverend Gaines...

603
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,761
I'd like to introduce you
to Sister Imabelle...

604
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,667
a good, decent,
God-fearing woman.

605
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:56,672
Well, God bless your head,
my sister.

606
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:59,834
Now, Jackson, I hope you took
my sermon to head.

607
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,342
You still ain't talking
to your stepbrother?

608
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,469
No.

609
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:03,876
<i>Forget your differences,
Jackson.</i>

610
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,710
<i>Life is too short
for all of this pettiness.</i>

611
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,908
- Yes, sir.
- Now, remember, Jackson...

612
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:10,179
you promised to look over
the church accounts.

613
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:13,016
- Um, we'll be right back.
- All right.

614
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:16,386
You just go on home.
I'll be there shortly, OK?

615
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:18,584
- OK.
- Bye.

616
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,758
Yes, sir!

617
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:42,069
What's the matter, baby?
Ain't you glad to see me?

618
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,741
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

619
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,479
I thought you was dead.
When I saw you at church...

620
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:51,884
I was so happy to see you,
I just wanted to cry.

621
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,751
I come over here
as quickly as I could...

622
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,654
just hoping you'd be here.

623
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,784
Oh, baby, here you are.

624
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:02,159
I think she's sweet on this lame
she's shacked up with.

625
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:05,596
And I think you don't know what
the fuck you talking about!

626
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:08,567
I needed some place to lay low,
so fuck you!

627
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:11,729
- No, fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

628
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,671
- No, fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

629
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:16,231
Oh, man, this is bullshit!

630
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:18,265
She and him was gonna
cut and run with the gold!

631
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:20,402
She come back to get the trunk!

632
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,413
Now, Slim...

633
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,108
would I go
for a chump like him...

634
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:27,810
after I been with
a man like you?

635
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:31,947
An undertaker? Ha ha ha!

636
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,650
Jodie, you don't know
what you're talking about.

637
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:43,186
This here's my Imabelle.

638
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:46,257
This our Imabelle.

639
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:56,473
Besides, all Imabelle done
is to set up our first city boy.

640
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:58,500
Mm-hmm.

641
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:04,677
You want to scam Jackson?

642
00:40:04,715 --> 00:40:07,912
Well, the boy look like
a born sucker to me.

643
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:12,446
We gonna take him
for everything he got, or...

644
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:16,854
Pop go the weasel.

645
00:40:16,893 --> 00:40:21,921
OK, baby, what you want to do?

646
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,797
<i>I think we ought
to bake some money.</i>

647
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,323
<i>That'll be perfect.</i>

648
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:29,803
Say, baby girl,
who's that on the wall?

649
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:34,001
Why, that's Jesus.

650
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:36,703
I know who the fuck Jesus is.

651
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:39,268
I'm talking about
the other dude.

652
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,008
That's his mama.

653
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,178
That's Jesus's mama?

654
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,514
Jackson's mama, fool!

655
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:51,614
His mama?

656
00:40:58,495 --> 00:41:00,861
That is one ugly bitch!

657
00:41:00,897 --> 00:41:02,660
Ha ha ha!

658
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,691
Jodie, she got a gorilla
in her past.

659
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,498
Ha ha ha! And just think...

660
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:11,302
if you and Jackson
were to make babies...

661
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,399
Ha ha ha ha!

662
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:16,371
Y'all wait in the car.

663
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,537
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

664
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:22,643
<i>Oh, baby girl...</i>

665
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,915
Now, let me take a look at you.

666
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:31,720
Come on, let me take
a good look at you.

667
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:36,126
Mm-hmm. Now you take off
that jacket.

668
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,594
Sure miss looking at you.

669
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,927
Mm-hmm.

670
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,401
Mmm mmm mmm!

671
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,838
Come here, baby.

672
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,504
- Come here.
- Ha ha ha!

673
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,343
<i>Um!</i>

674
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:02,214
You stretching
this boy's jeans?

675
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:07,051
What, baby?
That sucker?

676
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:11,387
Well, he be a dead sucker
if he don't profit me.

677
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:13,722
You understand?

678
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:26,132
<i>Babe, I don't know about this.</i>

679
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:28,294
Sounds like a hoax to me.

680
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,985
Baby, it ain't no hoax.

681
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:38,997
I have something for you.

682
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,970
Hmm?

683
00:42:58,283 --> 00:43:01,480
Oh, God.

684
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,851
You're gonna look fine
when you take me out...

685
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:06,322
with all that money
we gonna make.

686
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,017
Where'd you get it?

687
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,788
Did you sell
your grandmother's ring?

688
00:43:15,998 --> 00:43:17,295
Oh, God.

689
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,392
What's wrong, baby?

690
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:23,531
I think you're the answer
to all my prayers.

691
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:26,938
<i>You're every dream
I ever had come true.</i>

692
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:29,341
Jackson...

693
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:31,844
What? What?

694
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:37,374
I never meant you no harm.

695
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,512
<i>That's right.</i>

696
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:46,353
<i>This is
my life savings... $1,500.</i>

697
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,087
And you want me to raise it
to 15 Gs, right?

698
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,252
Right.

699
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,628
Uh, are you gonna
change mine, too?

700
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,830
He did it for me last week.
It's a miracle. A miracle!

701
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,430
- Really?
- Mm-hmm! This man's a genius!

702
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:07,033
He's gonna make us rich.
We gonna be rich, god damn it!

703
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:20,277
Now, I'm gonna have me
some water while it's baking.

704
00:44:22,322 --> 00:44:25,257
Uh, yeah.
Let me get some of that.

705
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:29,694
Why don't you sit down, daddy?
Your knees are shaking.

706
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:31,787
Thank you.

707
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,060
You know, if this works,
we can take the 15,000...

708
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:36,931
turn it into 150,000. 150,000,
turn it into 1.5 million.

709
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,128
<i>1.5 million
into 150 million...</i>

710
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:41,137
<i>150 million
into 1.5 billion dollars.</i>

711
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:43,036
We'll be rich.
We'll be really rich!

712
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:45,438
- Oh!
- Look out, honey!

713
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,534
Open in the name of the law!
I'm a United States marshal...

714
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:51,240
and I'll shoot the first
son of a bitch that moves!

715
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:53,270
- Aah!
- Run, daddy, run!

716
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,441
Don't you move, boy!

717
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:57,280
I don't want to have to put
a bullet in your ass!

718
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,220
I ain't moving!
I ain't moving! Look!

719
00:45:00,254 --> 00:45:02,950
Man, put your hands down.
This ain't no goddamn movie.

720
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,450
Now, you stand up here and take
your punishment like a man.

721
00:45:07,493 --> 00:45:10,394
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

722
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,490
What, your woman
put you up to this?

723
00:45:13,532 --> 00:45:16,501
Oh, no.
She's a law-abiding woman.

724
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:18,969
She ain't mine, neither.
No, no.

725
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:23,301
I don't want to be rude
or nothing...

726
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:27,209
but would it be OK...
if I gave you $20G...

727
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:29,735
would you let me go?

728
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:32,407
<i>Oh, Lord, ashes to ashes
and dusk to dusk.</i>

729
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:36,146
All he left me was his debts.

730
00:45:36,185 --> 00:45:38,653
It's OK,
my little chocolate bunny.

731
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,485
You see,
we're better off without him.

732
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:46,255
See, y-your husband's
in a better place, and so am I.

733
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:49,423
Please forgive me.

734
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:52,429
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

735
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:10,039
Mmm! That you, Louis?

736
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,675
No, sir. It's me, Jackson.

737
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:15,810
I thought you took
the afternoon off.

738
00:46:15,852 --> 00:46:17,046
Yes, sir.

739
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:19,714
But there were some numbers
that didn't add up...

740
00:46:19,756 --> 00:46:22,122
and I thought they might
have overcharged us...

741
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:24,125
on that embalming fluid.

742
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,289
I ain't gonna give you no raise,
son, so don't overdo it.

743
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,298
Yes, sir.

744
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:36,632
<i>I'll sop you like a biscuit
on some gravy.</i>

745
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,639
Just think of me as smooth
as a piece of okra.

746
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:46,139
I'd suck you like a neck bone.

747
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:51,912
Here's the money.

748
00:46:56,753 --> 00:47:00,348
You stay away from that woman.

749
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:05,486
Please...

750
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:06,825
Uhh!

751
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:15,131
You're lucky.

752
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:21,538
I don't want
to see you no more.

753
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:56,732
Imabelle?

754
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:18,686
Don't let her be gone, God.

755
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,129
Don't let her be gone.
Don't let her be gone.

756
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:31,630
She took the cross!

757
00:48:33,575 --> 00:48:36,408
Sure took your time
getting here.

758
00:48:36,444 --> 00:48:38,002
We do the best we can, ma'am.

759
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:40,138
<i>Now, this is his room.</i>

760
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:43,014
<i>And this is him.</i>

761
00:48:44,184 --> 00:48:46,652
Don't surprise me none.

762
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:50,588
I don't know why old man Clay
trusted him in the first place.

763
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:51,988
You said he had
a woman up here.

764
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:54,549
Some southern gal.
She's a thief, too.

765
00:48:54,593 --> 00:48:57,824
Oh! Evil, evil woman!

766
00:48:57,862 --> 00:48:59,830
The same detectives
what arrested Jackson...

767
00:48:59,864 --> 00:49:02,628
came back with two more
and arrested her.

768
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,634
Said they wasn't
no regular detectives...

769
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:07,136
said they was
some special agents.

770
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,263
And they took her trunk
as evidence.

771
00:49:09,306 --> 00:49:11,774
- Oh, yeah? What was in it?
- I don't know.

772
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:14,640
Whatever it was, it certainly
must have been important...

773
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:16,201
the way they was carrying on.

774
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,679
<i>Those could be the Mississippi
boys we been looking for.</i>

775
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:21,910
<i>Yeah! The ones
with the trunk of gold!</i>

776
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,612
<i>Maybe the gal's
trunk was full of her panties.</i>

777
00:49:24,652 --> 00:49:25,778
Gold!

778
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:27,548
- Maybe it wasn't.
- Maybe it wasn't.

779
00:49:27,588 --> 00:49:30,056
Well, maybe it was,
and maybe it wasn't.

780
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:34,823
But somebody don't come up
with my $175.95 for my stove...

781
00:49:34,861 --> 00:49:36,954
I'm gonna raise some hell,
you hear me?

782
00:49:36,996 --> 00:49:38,691
I'm really gonna raise hell!

783
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,027
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

784
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:42,090
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's Jesus.

785
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:44,102
I know that's Jesus.
I mean the other guy.

786
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:45,535
That's his mama.

787
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,300
- Jesus!
- God damn!

788
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:50,432
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

789
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:54,001
<i>Y'all welcome.</i>

790
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:58,205
Wake up, my brothers and
sisters, for the time has come!

791
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:59,715
For we do not wish
amalgamating...

792
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,739
with the pale-skinned nation
of the Europeans.

793
00:50:01,784 --> 00:50:03,411
Blacks should quit bothering
with his religion!

794
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:05,386
Quit bothering with hot combs
and skin-bleaching!

795
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,910
Man is made of haste,
my brother!

796
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:10,322
I ask you to let me
show you my portion!

797
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:13,657
I haven't got time for you
right now, Claude X.

798
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:17,289
Listen, you just slow down.
I'm gonna tell you something.

799
00:50:17,331 --> 00:50:19,765
You're looking for your woman.

800
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,494
She's nowhere to be found.

801
00:50:21,534 --> 00:50:24,560
I saw her leaving
with some serious black devils.

802
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,595
Now, it may do you well
to seek a brother's help.

803
00:50:26,638 --> 00:50:28,697
You talking about
my stepbrother?

804
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,675
Uh-uh. We ain't been talking
for five years.

805
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,302
Well, you better sta? now.

806
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:36,142
I don't want
to talk to my brother.

807
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,512
I wanna talk to Reverend Gaines.
He'll know what I should do.

808
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:41,313
If you want to find God,
you talk to a preacher.

809
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:45,185
If you want to find devils,
you talk to a demon.

810
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,281
These will take
your uncle Inell...

811
00:50:50,325 --> 00:50:52,259
straight to the bosom
of the Lord.

812
00:50:52,294 --> 00:50:55,752
For I have seen heaven open
and beheld the white horse.

813
00:50:55,796 --> 00:50:58,264
That'll be $5.00.

814
00:50:58,299 --> 00:50:59,789
I told you...

815
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:03,565
No, no. There he his.

816
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,299
Oh, my God!

817
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:07,966
Brother Gabriel's
got your ticket.

818
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:11,307
I can't believe my own brother's
out here on the street corner...

819
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:14,870
impersonating a man of God!
What are you think...

820
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:17,473
Don't call me Sherman in public,
you hear what I'm saying?

821
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:18,948
That's your Christian name.

822
00:51:18,983 --> 00:51:19,972
Claude X, why you bring
this square around here?

823
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:21,451
Brothers, brothers.

824
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:23,716
<i>Goldy, your brother
needs your help.</i>

825
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:25,813
<i>He has been robbed
of his woman...</i>

826
00:51:25,856 --> 00:51:28,450
and the Prophet says
lower thy wings in kindness...

827
00:51:28,492 --> 00:51:31,825
- to thy tribe of near-kin.
- Tribe, my ass!

828
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:33,488
Just because...

829
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:35,224
What's the daily word,
Reverend?

830
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:37,459
And the Savior said
to his disciples...

831
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:41,902
said, "He that loveth
his brother more than me...

832
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:43,904
"is not worthy of me."

833
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,303
The man is a demon.

834
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,830
- What?
- Run.

835
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:50,742
- That's not true.
- Run away from him!

836
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:53,803
- Blind man...
- I don't need no bean pie!

837
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:55,575
What you need
is a divine message!

838
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:58,516
Awaken, my people!
The so-called Negroes...

839
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,847
So, what happened, bros?

840
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:02,251
That gold-digger you met at
the Royale take all your money?

841
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,845
She didn't have
nothing to do with it.

842
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,982
Just 'cause the only kind
of woman you associate with...

843
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:08,491
is prostitutes and lowlifes-
Put that back!

844
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:11,051
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Put that back!

845
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,289
Just because you abandoned
me and Mama...

846
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:16,457
and then broke her head
with all your evil ways...

847
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:19,468
don't mean that everybody
in the world is just like you!

848
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:20,866
Come here talking
that holier-than-thou shit...

849
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:23,371
looking for me to help you?
Fuck you, man!

850
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:27,501
You ain't said five decent words
to me in five years...

851
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:29,772
and now just 'cause
you need something...

852
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,405
That's right! I need you to
help me find my woman, Sherman!

853
00:52:32,446 --> 00:52:34,607
- I need your help!
- Help yourself, man!

854
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,275
Here-here's some tickets
to heaven.

855
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:37,749
<i>Move your preaching ass!</i>

856
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:40,582
You want to run me down?
A man of the cloth?

857
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,610
<i>Com flake-eating motherfucker!
Get out of the way!</i>

858
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:43,917
Help me, Sherman!
You're my brother!

859
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:45,116
- Forget it!
- We're blood!

860
00:52:45,157 --> 00:52:47,352
- No!
- There's gold.

861
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:50,293
There's a trunk full of gold.

862
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:53,456
Gold.

863
00:52:53,497 --> 00:52:57,194
You say there's a trunk
full of gold?

864
00:52:57,234 --> 00:52:59,134
You ain't never gonna change.

865
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:01,160
No. I ain't never gonna change.

866
00:53:01,204 --> 00:53:03,195
Come here for a second. Shit.

867
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:05,230
And then they put
the money in the stove...

868
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:07,834
And the stove blew up,
and the marshal ran in...

869
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:10,003
- and blip blop de blam.
- How you know that?

870
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,275
My very own brother
taken in by the bluff.

871
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,339
But there was a hundred dollars
came outta that stove.

872
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:17,179
What's the matter with you?
Where's your fucking brain, huh?

873
00:53:17,218 --> 00:53:19,652
You been drinking
embalming fluid or some shit?

874
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:20,915
You been suckered...

875
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:23,252
and your gal run off with
the stud that took your money.

876
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:25,416
She didn't run off.
They took her, Sherman!

877
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,585
She's in trouble, too.
I know. I can feel her.

878
00:53:27,627 --> 00:53:30,255
She's in trouble?
You the one's in trouble...

879
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:31,922
Mr. Churchgoing Man.

880
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:35,263
Heh heh. Shit,
you just robbed your own boss.

881
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,063
You motherfuckers
got a cigarette?

882
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:39,729
No, we ain't got no cigarette.

883
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:43,832
Listen, I'll help you
get your woman back.

884
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,342
First, we call Kathy,
then we go see Blind.

885
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,105
But I keep the gold,
you understand?

886
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:49,840
You get the woman,
I get the gold.

887
00:53:49,879 --> 00:53:52,211
Woman, gold. Strictly business.

888
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:53,647
- Got it?
- Got it.

889
00:53:53,682 --> 00:53:54,671
All right.

890
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:56,810
You motherfuckers is in my way!

891
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:58,819
Give me your money...

892
00:53:58,853 --> 00:54:01,651
and don't think
I wouldn't cut you, Reverend!

893
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:03,156
Have mercy, son.

894
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:06,757
You lucky I got
my reverend shit on...

895
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:08,489
otherwise I'd blow
your fucking lips off.

896
00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:10,997
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm going!

897
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,022
I can't believe that. Man tried
to stick up a preacher!

898
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,034
So we got a deal, bros?

899
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:18,127
I just want
to get her back, Sherman.

900
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,831
I don't care nothing
about no gold.

901
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:22,032
Come with me, chump.

902
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:24,564
And stop calling me Sherman.

903
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:27,372
- Where you taking me, Sherman?
- Shh!

904
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:36,947
Will Kill, what you been doing?

905
00:54:36,986 --> 00:54:38,749
Not a goddamn thing.

906
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:42,723
- Blind Man here?
- He's back there.

907
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:46,954
Shit.

908
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:48,928
<i>That's him!
Coming to get it!</i>

909
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:51,955
Sherman! There are
half-dressed women in here.

910
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,693
You know my stepbrother?

911
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:55,667
<i>I'm Jackson.</i>

912
00:54:55,702 --> 00:54:58,136
- Really?
- Yeah.

913
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,162
Jackson, uh...

914
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:02,868
why don't you check out
the crap table?

915
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:05,809
Go ahead. Good.

916
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,311
Stepbrother?

917
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:11,748
Yeah. Listen,
I need some information.

918
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:24,706
It's that Jackson, ain't it?

919
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,274
You're jerking that lame.

920
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,277
Oh, come on, baby.
What you talking about?

921
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:33,984
What is it?
You got religion, baby?

922
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:39,257
Huh? Is that what it is?

923
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,923
Or is there something wrong?

924
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:47,926
do this tonight.

925
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,903
I want you
to stop treating me...

926
00:55:49,937 --> 00:55:51,734
like I got nothing
to say in this.

927
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:53,900
Look, I haven't got time
to explain everything to you.

928
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:55,374
Like I said, just trust me.

929
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:57,104
That's not something
we're used to doing with you.

930
00:55:57,144 --> 00:55:58,702
We? Who's we?

931
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:01,077
The family! You know,
the people you forgot about?

932
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:02,877
Oh, get off my back!

933
00:56:02,915 --> 00:56:05,748
You really don't care,
do you? You really don't care!

934
00:56:05,785 --> 00:56:08,015
You didn't even come
to your mama's funeral!

935
00:56:08,054 --> 00:56:11,683
Hey! You don't know what
the fuck you're talking about!

936
00:56:11,723 --> 00:56:13,748
And it ain't none of
your fucking business...

937
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:15,623
what I did or didn't do!

938
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:19,186
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me with your gun next?

939
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:23,162
Just forget it.

940
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,431
Just forget it and stick with
the business deal. All right?

941
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,995
I ain't never gonna own you
as my brother.

942
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:34,099
And that goes double for me,
man. That's double for me!

943
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:35,871
You ain't got no feeling.

944
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:37,572
I got feelings! I got...

945
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:40,512
Who are you to tell me
I ain't got no feelings?!

946
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:43,517
I'm a fool for talking to you.
Come on!

947
00:56:57,096 --> 00:56:58,688
Oh!

948
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:04,066
<i>? And I'm saving all my loving
just for you ?</i>

949
00:57:06,103 --> 00:57:07,263
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

950
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,548
Didn't tell me you were
taking me to a whorehouse.

951
00:57:24,586 --> 00:57:26,213
Shut up, man. Any luck?

952
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:28,687
Yeah, I think so.

953
00:57:28,722 --> 00:57:29,984
Who's the 'john'?

954
00:57:30,023 --> 00:57:32,617
My name's not John. My name
is Jackson. Thank you, ma'am.

955
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:35,183
Jackson?
You two are stepbrothers?

956
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:36,695
<i>You made up or something?</i>

957
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:39,926
No, no. Just got a little
business deal going, that's all.

958
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:42,126
<i>I think it ain't like that.</i>

959
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,101
<i>Come on, sit down.
Sit down, Jackson.</i>

960
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:46,969
I'll stand.
Thank you very much.

961
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,096
Where's he at?

962
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:52,098
Ah, Teena's got his lap staked.

963
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:54,134
Here.

964
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:56,236
<i>Father, lead us not
into temptation...</i>

965
00:57:56,279 --> 00:57:57,803
<i>but deliver us from evil!</i>

966
00:57:57,847 --> 00:58:00,714
<i>- Ooh, is that them?
- Yeah, I think so.</i>

967
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:07,921
Come on! Come on! Come on!

968
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:11,152
It just ain't right.
Just ain't right.

969
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,825
I'll handle this!

970
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,124
Excuse me! Excuse me!

971
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:24,432
- What's that lame doing?
- Oh, shit!

972
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,735
- Shit!
- Wait! I'll get him!

973
00:58:27,773 --> 00:58:29,502
Yeah! Yeah!

974
00:58:33,745 --> 00:58:35,474
Hey, you!

975
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,606
<i>Ooh!</i>

976
00:58:57,064 --> 00:58:59,089
Just throw his ass down there!

977
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:00,293
That is your brother?

978
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:02,666
Yes! And you should have
hit him twice!

979
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:04,000
You should have shot him!

980
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:06,267
All right!

981
00:59:07,373 --> 00:59:10,308
I gotta go wee-wee.

982
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:13,539
Ain't you a little old
to be talking that way?

983
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:17,310
I talk that way,
I stay that way, honey.

984
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:19,475
I'll be right back.

985
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:26,779
- Goldy, listen! I got it.
- What?

986
00:59:26,823 --> 00:59:30,418
He's been telling me about this
gold mine he's representing...

987
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,258
and he's been going all over the
United States selling shares.

988
00:59:33,295 --> 00:59:35,456
How do you know
he's not scamming you?

989
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:38,057
Because he's got two partners,
plus a contact man...

990
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,796
named Gus Parsons
working the Braddock Bar.

991
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:43,303
And he said he's gonna show me
a trunk full of gold...

992
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:44,737
that they're using as bait.

993
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:47,070
But listen. They're pulling out
tomorrow night.

994
00:59:47,107 --> 00:59:49,200
- You did great, baby.
- Thanks.

995
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:52,076
<i>Keep him talking!</i>

996
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,738
<i>You gotta help me.</i>

997
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:55,906
<i>Son, you've gotta know
when you've had enough.</i>

998
00:59:55,948 --> 00:59:59,509
I got nothing. This is my chance
to get something.

999
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:02,179
Now, either help me
or I'm gonna do it alone.

1000
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,414
Not this time.

1001
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,979
<i>Did you hit me?</i>

1002
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,752
Sherman!

1003
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:10,692
What are you thinking about,
slugging your own brother?

1004
01:00:10,728 --> 01:00:13,390
I didn't hit you.
But I should've hit you!

1005
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:14,487
He hit you!

1006
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,861
He?

1007
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:19,660
Oh, God.

1008
01:00:24,825 --> 01:00:26,986
Now, let's just go over this
one more time.

1009
01:00:27,028 --> 01:00:29,189
It's very important.
There are three things...

1010
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:32,562
I do not want you to do tonight.
One... don't drink.

1011
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:35,227
Don't drink? Why would I drink?
I don't drink.

1012
01:00:35,267 --> 01:00:37,394
That's your problem. But just
stick with that tonight.

1013
01:00:37,436 --> 01:00:40,269
OK? Two...
don't flash this roll..

1014
01:00:40,306 --> 01:00:42,240
In front of anybody
but Gus parsons.

1015
01:00:42,273 --> 01:00:44,537
- Don't flash this roll.
- Right.

1016
01:00:44,576 --> 01:00:46,806
All right, number thr...

1017
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,812
What is that shit on your face?

1018
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,574
It's my disguise.

1019
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:51,774
All right. Three...

1020
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,578
should you meet up
with Gus persons...

1021
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:56,211
and he wants to take you
to the gold, you go by cab.

1022
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,549
Go by cab.

1023
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,521
Does he always have
to repeat everything?

1024
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,614
Go get him.
I'm right behind you.

1025
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:03,420
That's what I'm afraid of.

1026
01:01:11,532 --> 01:01:12,794
Good evening.

1027
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,960
Good evening.

1028
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:16,026
Evening.

1029
01:01:17,604 --> 01:01:19,435
Hello.

1030
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,701
<i>Good evening.</i>

1031
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,710
I bet he fucks it up.

1032
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,370
I bet he pulls it off.

1033
01:01:26,411 --> 01:01:27,810
$20 he'll miss.

1034
01:01:27,846 --> 01:01:29,336
Twenty.

1035
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,952
I'll have a glass of milk.

1036
01:01:37,988 --> 01:01:40,456
We don't serve no goddamn milk.

1037
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:43,687
No milk. Right.

1038
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:45,922
Well, how about some water?

1039
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:47,986
We don't serve
no goddamn water.

1040
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,624
No water. Right.

1041
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,762
Well, you know, I'll just have
whatever you suggest.

1042
01:01:58,472 --> 01:01:59,632
Thank you very much.

1043
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:11,074
Why is he drinking?

1044
01:02:11,117 --> 01:02:14,314
Ha ha ha!
'Cause you owe me $20.

1045
01:02:14,352 --> 01:02:17,287
What... is this stuff?

1046
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:18,983
Rye goddamn whiskey.

1047
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:21,423
It's good. Heh.

1048
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:23,824
I can't... I can't believe this.

1049
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:29,128
Yes, except that's two drinks
at $20... that's $40.

1050
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:31,998
Thank you, that is
very hospitable of you!

1051
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:33,969
It ain't goddamn free.

1052
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:36,899
No, no.

1053
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:40,169
I meant hospitable in spirit.
I got plenty of money.

1054
01:02:40,207 --> 01:02:41,333
Plenty of money!

1055
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,138
<i>Payday.</i>

1056
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,702
Out comes the roll.
Out comes the roll.

1057
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:49,778
What's wrong with you?

1058
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:51,784
You trying
to get your throat cut?

1059
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:53,115
You said it ain't free.

1060
01:02:53,153 --> 01:02:55,917
I'm just paying for my drinks,
thank you very much!

1061
01:02:55,954 --> 01:02:57,751
<i>I don't want no trouble.</i>

1062
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,519
<i>You're so unreasonable!</i>

1063
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:05,127
That's 'cause he knows
you paid him with my money.

1064
01:03:05,163 --> 01:03:07,256
What are you talking about?

1065
01:03:07,298 --> 01:03:08,959
This here's my money.

1066
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:12,264
I know my money when I see it.
You done picked my pocket.

1067
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:16,466
- Don't let him scare you, honey.
- Me? Scared? Ha ha.

1068
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,166
That will be the day.

1069
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,334
I'll have another rye whiskey.

1070
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:23,368
Can't nobody tell me
I don't know my own money.

1071
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:25,140
Now, wait a minute.

1072
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,875
What is the difference
between...

1073
01:03:26,915 --> 01:03:28,382
Uhh!

1074
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:30,748
<i>He's got a gun!</i>

1075
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:32,649
I don't know how much money
you owe me now.

1076
01:03:32,686 --> 01:03:34,677
You're the punk who robbed me
last night, ain't you?

1077
01:03:34,722 --> 01:03:37,247
I got a good notion
to blow your fucking brains out!

1078
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,814
I wouldn't rob you, boss.

1079
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,519
Swear for the cross
it wasn't me.

1080
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,391
Maybe it was that man
what robbed you.

1081
01:03:42,428 --> 01:03:44,225
'Cause he's sporting
a big roll from somewhere.

1082
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:46,059
Don't you put that on me.

1083
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:48,794
I hit the numbers last night.
I can prove that.

1084
01:03:48,834 --> 01:03:50,461
Oh, I know
it wasn't you, friend.

1085
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:51,729
And maybe it wasn't you,
either...

1086
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:53,737
but you sure as hell robbed
somebody in your lifetime...

1087
01:03:53,771 --> 01:03:55,411
so you're just getting
what's owed to you!

1088
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:57,839
Get your ass outta here!

1089
01:03:57,874 --> 01:04:00,502
I was robbed of $700
last night!

1090
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:01,840
Man tried to hit me.

1091
01:04:01,878 --> 01:04:03,277
But you know something?

1092
01:04:03,313 --> 01:04:04,837
That really don't
matter now, friend...

1093
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,110
<i>because I have tucked into
something that's nice...</i>

1094
01:04:07,149 --> 01:04:09,811
<i>something that's solid gold.</i>

1095
01:04:09,852 --> 01:04:11,012
Gold?

1096
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:13,179
Gus Parsons, real estate.

1097
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:16,019
Coleman Jackson,
burial services.

1098
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:18,287
Jackson, huh?
Hey, listen, Jackson.

1099
01:04:18,325 --> 01:04:23,194
How would you like to meet some
very successful businessmen...

1100
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:25,755
- men just like yourself?
- Like me?

1101
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:27,459
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go this way.

1102
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,060
<i>This is the luckiest night
of your life.</i>

1103
01:04:30,102 --> 01:04:31,262
Jackson, come here.

1104
01:04:31,303 --> 01:04:33,464
What is he...

1105
01:04:34,973 --> 01:04:37,100
I gonna have
to blindfold you, friend.

1106
01:04:37,142 --> 01:04:39,770
Blindfold me? For what?

1107
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:44,907
My partners have $100,000 worth
of gold ore in their possession.

1108
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,041
Now, they can't be
taking no chances.

1109
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,243
Yeah, but I ain't...

1110
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,775
Hey, Jackson.
I understand completely.

1111
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,981
You don't know me
from the man in the moon...

1112
01:04:53,021 --> 01:04:55,182
SO...

1113
01:04:55,223 --> 01:04:57,214
I'm gonna give you my gun.

1114
01:04:59,294 --> 01:05:00,784
Thank you very much.

1115
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,125
Would you lean over, please,
Mr. Jackson?

1116
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:20,401
<i>Get that door, baby girl.</i>

1117
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:24,771
Mmm.

1118
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:39,126
There you are.

1119
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:41,152
What, do y'all know each other?

1120
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:46,929
I've been in jail two weeks...

1121
01:05:46,968 --> 01:05:50,404
and I ain't seen a woman
in all that time.

1122
01:05:50,437 --> 01:05:52,564
Maybe, uh...

1123
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:55,632
I just dreamed about you.

1124
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,140
First, you... you drain
the blood.

1125
01:06:03,181 --> 01:06:04,808
Ha! And then...

1126
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:07,944
and then you shoot 'em up
with embalming fluid.

1127
01:06:07,986 --> 01:06:09,283
Damn!

1128
01:06:09,321 --> 01:06:13,815
How do you keep their faces
from turning all blue and shit?

1129
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:14,882
Make-up.

1130
01:06:14,925 --> 01:06:17,325
Jesus.

1131
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:20,286
<i>Shit!</i>

1132
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,025
Look, whatever you do,
don't lose him.

1133
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,692
This guy's playing whip-ass.

1134
01:06:23,732 --> 01:06:25,700
Since when are you worried
about your brother's ass?

1135
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:27,702
Since he started shitting gold.

1136
01:06:29,271 --> 01:06:30,329
Hold on!

1137
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:41,006
<i>- Whoa!
- Get out of the way!</i>

1138
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:42,378
What's wrong with the street?!

1139
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,714
Ooh! Somebody almost had
an accident or something.

1140
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:49,243
Yeah, an accident.

1141
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:53,684
Are we almost there?

1142
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:55,522
Heh heh heh heh.

1143
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,893
Yeah, we're almost there.

1144
01:06:58,929 --> 01:07:00,556
<i>In this dream...</i>

1145
01:07:00,597 --> 01:07:03,498
<i>a woman almost as fine
as her...</i>

1146
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:06,560
<i>is relaxing on the sofa with...</i>

1147
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:10,094
trying to interest me
in a box of, uh...

1148
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,401
A box of what?

1149
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,035
Let me see. I think it was...

1150
01:07:15,076 --> 01:07:17,943
candy. Heh heh heh.

1151
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:22,648
Come over here, baby.

1152
01:07:22,683 --> 01:07:25,083
Come over here. Heh heh heh.

1153
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,016
Ah, don't you love it
when dreams come true?

1154
01:07:33,126 --> 01:07:35,185
Damn, man.

1155
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:37,195
Slim.

1156
01:07:37,229 --> 01:07:40,460
<i>If your gold is as good
as your taste in women...</i>

1157
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:41,760
y'all got a deal.

1158
01:07:41,799 --> 01:07:43,391
Did you bring the money?

1159
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,892
It'll be at my place
later tonight.

1160
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:51,034
A sweet...
chocolate box of...

1161
01:07:51,074 --> 01:07:52,371
candy.

1162
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:53,501
Heh heh heh.

1163
01:07:57,112 --> 01:07:58,136
Yeah.

1164
01:08:08,455 --> 01:08:11,083
<i>You know, Jackson,
I really trusted you...</i>

1165
01:08:11,124 --> 01:08:14,093
<i>but you are
a big disappointment to me.</i>

1166
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:16,652
<i>Disappointment?
What are you talking about?</i>

1167
01:08:21,367 --> 01:08:24,234
Give me the money, Jackson.

1168
01:08:24,269 --> 01:08:26,635
What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

1169
01:08:26,671 --> 01:08:28,969
- Ha ha ha!
- Where's Imabelle?

1170
01:08:29,007 --> 01:08:32,101
Oh, so you're the fool.

1171
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:35,111
If you don't tell me
where Imabelle is...

1172
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:38,308
I will shoot you dead.

1173
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,906
Be my guest.

1174
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,645
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1175
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,111
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1176
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:48,281
The money, Jackson.

1177
01:08:58,531 --> 01:09:00,362
What the fuck is this?

1178
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,597
It's play money.
Now, ain't that a dirty trick?

1179
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:06,765
Get your ass outta this car.
Get outta this car!

1180
01:09:09,575 --> 01:09:13,011
Now I'm gonna let you hear
what a real gun sounds like.

1181
01:09:13,044 --> 01:09:15,945
'Cause guess what? It's gonna be
the last thing you ever hear.

1182
01:09:17,148 --> 01:09:19,446
Next time you try
to duck somebody...

1183
01:09:19,483 --> 01:09:21,348
take your big-ass foot
off the brake light.

1184
01:09:21,385 --> 01:09:24,013
Look, if you guys are the cops,
I want my lawyer, understand?

1185
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:26,989
You want a lawyer? Big Kathy,
didn't you used to be a lawyer?

1186
01:09:27,023 --> 01:09:29,389
Ah, shit! You son of a bitch!

1187
01:09:29,425 --> 01:09:31,188
That will be $500.

1188
01:09:31,227 --> 01:09:33,388
Take us where
you take the marks.

1189
01:09:42,007 --> 01:09:44,134
Ah-ah-ah! Stay in the car.

1190
01:09:47,178 --> 01:09:50,113
- Where are they?
- Top floor.

1191
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,710
Hurry up!

1192
01:10:00,122 --> 01:10:02,317
<i>You ever seen such
a sorry-looking bunch...</i>

1193
01:10:02,358 --> 01:10:05,088
<i>of cotton-picking farmers
in your whole life?</i>

1194
01:10:05,127 --> 01:10:06,856
Mmm mmm mmm!

1195
01:10:21,941 --> 01:10:24,273
- Operator.
- Get me the police.

1196
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:29,444
I can smell it like
biscuits and gravy.

1197
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:30,778
Heh heh heh.

1198
01:10:30,815 --> 01:10:33,045
<i>You ain't gonna eat
no more supper now?</i>

1199
01:10:33,084 --> 01:10:34,642
Yeah.

1200
01:10:34,686 --> 01:10:39,089
<i>It's me... Gus. I brought
investors for the gold mine.</i>

1201
01:10:41,025 --> 01:10:42,788
Go ahead.

1202
01:10:42,825 --> 01:10:44,690
<i>Here we go again.</i>

1203
01:10:46,496 --> 01:10:48,225
It's the police, asshole.
Everybody freeze!

1204
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:49,322
<i>Damn you, Gus!</i>

1205
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:51,457
Freeze right there and shut up!

1206
01:10:53,535 --> 01:10:54,627
Imabelle.

1207
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,404
Hey! It's that thieving undertaker!

1208
01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:04,138
Hey! Come back here! Come here!

1209
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,113
Ooh, lordy, lordy!

1210
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,210
Where are they?

1211
01:11:14,253 --> 01:11:15,618
- Fifth floor!
- Got it!

1212
01:11:15,654 --> 01:11:18,282
- What's the matter?
- My little baby toe!

1213
01:11:18,323 --> 01:11:20,154
Come on, they're getting away!

1214
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:21,351
Let 'em go!

1215
01:11:21,392 --> 01:11:23,121
Come on!

1216
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:24,924
I'm gonna kill somebody now!

1217
01:11:26,296 --> 01:11:28,992
What the fuck you looking at?
I'm gonna shoot you first...

1218
01:11:29,032 --> 01:11:31,159
anybody makes a strange move,
you got that?

1219
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,259
- Eat shit.
- Shut up!

1220
01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:34,564
<i>All right, come on, now.</i>

1221
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:36,697
<i>Cooperate,
and we'll go easy on you.</i>

1222
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:38,366
Coffin Ed and Grave Digger
are here!

1223
01:11:38,406 --> 01:11:39,464
- Mm-mm!
- Jackson!

1224
01:11:39,507 --> 01:11:41,304
- Baby!
- Police! Everybody freeze!

1225
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:43,174
- Hank, acid!
- Aah!

1226
01:11:45,379 --> 01:11:47,040
Aaah!

1227
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:50,642
Jackson! Where are you,
so I can shoot you?

1228
01:11:50,684 --> 01:11:53,050
- Come on!
- Let's go!

1229
01:11:53,086 --> 01:11:54,246
Let's get outta here!

1230
01:11:54,287 --> 01:11:55,276
You all right?

1231
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:57,653
Jackson, I told you
to wait in the car!

1232
01:11:58,691 --> 01:12:00,352
Back up!

1233
01:12:00,392 --> 01:12:02,383
- Hands up!
- Back up!

1234
01:12:02,427 --> 01:12:04,292
That's right, Goldy, run!

1235
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:06,797
Straight on up!

1236
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:08,594
Go get the car!

1237
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,997
Imabelle!

1238
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,627
Shut up, man.

1239
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,371
Someday, Goldy! Someday...

1240
01:12:27,415 --> 01:12:29,178
I'm gonna kick your ass!

1241
01:12:33,021 --> 01:12:34,215
Jackson.

1242
01:12:43,596 --> 01:12:46,224
<i>Imabelle!</i>

1243
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:47,289
Imabelle!

1244
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:50,763
<i>Show your hands now, sucker!</i>

1245
01:12:50,802 --> 01:12:52,030
Jackson!

1246
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,731
Imabelle!

1247
01:12:53,772 --> 01:12:55,239
Imabelle!

1248
01:12:56,507 --> 01:12:57,633
Jackson!

1249
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:00,975
Imabelle!

1250
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:06,471
Imabelle! I'm coming
to get you, baby!

1251
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:07,710
I love you!

1252
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,274
- Jackson!
- I love you, baby!

1253
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,286
Jackson, don't jump!

1254
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,481
Ohm

1255
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:14,955
Imabelle!

1256
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,855
Oh, my God! He made it!

1257
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,853
OK! OK! All right!

1258
01:13:22,862 --> 01:13:25,092
Imabelle! Imabelle! Imabelle!

1259
01:13:25,131 --> 01:13:26,996
Oh, bless you, Jesus!

1260
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:28,591
Ha! I made it!

1261
01:13:28,635 --> 01:13:31,160
Jackson! Stop jumping!

1262
01:13:33,505 --> 01:13:36,372
Ed! Ed! No, no, no, no, no!

1263
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:41,643
I'm crazy,
but I ain't no damn fool.

1264
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,374
Someday, Goldy!

1265
01:13:43,414 --> 01:13:45,109
Someday!

1266
01:13:45,148 --> 01:13:46,479
Imabelle!

1267
01:13:46,516 --> 01:13:48,040
Jackson! Jackson!

1268
01:13:48,085 --> 01:13:50,645
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

1269
01:13:50,686 --> 01:13:51,948
I love her.

1270
01:13:51,987 --> 01:13:55,354
All right. But you got anything
against taking the stairs?

1271
01:13:55,391 --> 01:13:56,756
<i>Shit!</i>

1272
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,158
- Taxi!
- Hey!

1273
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:00,957
Taxi!

1274
01:14:03,798 --> 01:14:05,265
All right, get your ass out!

1275
01:14:09,703 --> 01:14:11,068
Imabelle!

1276
01:14:11,105 --> 01:14:13,630
- Imabelle!
- Come on!

1277
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:15,004
Let's go! Let's go!

1278
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:19,943
Come on, Jackson!
I'm gonna leave you!

1279
01:14:19,978 --> 01:14:23,539
Hurry up!
Follow that red gypsy cab!

1280
01:14:23,582 --> 01:14:25,106
Don't lose 'em!

1281
01:14:28,185 --> 01:14:29,311
This way!

1282
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:33,850
There's nobody here. Huh?

1283
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,688
- She went this way. I know it.
- You know it?!

1284
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:40,620
What are you listening
to him for?

1285
01:14:40,662 --> 01:14:42,459
He's in love.

1286
01:14:42,498 --> 01:14:43,658
That way!

1287
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:53,100
This is unbelievable.

1288
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:55,507
- There she is.
- This is unbe...

1289
01:15:00,046 --> 01:15:02,810
Let's just go in there
and get her.

1290
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:06,614
Just wait a minute now.
Gotta do this thing right.

1291
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:08,847
See, what we really need
is something big enough...

1292
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:10,184
to carry the gold in.

1293
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:11,882
The hearse.

1294
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:13,254
<i>Your boss's hearse.</i>

1295
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,122
I don't care nothing
about the gold.

1296
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:18,060
Hey, we got a deal, remember?
The girl for the gold.

1297
01:15:18,095 --> 01:15:20,586
Or you can go up there
by yourself.

1298
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:22,326
All right.

1299
01:15:22,365 --> 01:15:24,731
Just give me bullets
for my gun first.

1300
01:15:26,536 --> 01:15:28,970
<i>- I'll give you one bullet.
- One bullet?</i>

1301
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:30,835
That's right. One bullet.

1302
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,040
<i>Deal?</i>

1303
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:35,064
Deal.

1304
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:41,398
- It's gonna be OK.
- What you saying, baby girl?

1305
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:45,064
I got a hole in my chest.
I need a fucking doctor!

1306
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:46,402
That's too damn bad.

1307
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,999
You got us hot as hell
as it is.

1308
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:50,907
Jodie, you call Easy Money...

1309
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,776
<i>see if he can make that meeting
a little earlier.</i>

1310
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:57,643
Imabelle will stay
with the gold.

1311
01:15:57,682 --> 01:15:58,910
- Imabelle?
- Imabelle?

1312
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:01,510
Well, she can't do nothing
with it by herself.

1313
01:16:01,552 --> 01:16:04,715
<i>What about Gus?</i>

1314
01:16:04,755 --> 01:16:06,086
Fuck Gus.

1315
01:16:06,123 --> 01:16:08,057
Hey, man,
what you talking about?

1316
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:10,321
Pop go the weasel.

1317
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:13,226
Don't you kill him, Slim.

1318
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:16,129
Get the fuck outta the way.

1319
01:16:17,265 --> 01:16:19,495
<i>Move!</i>

1320
01:16:23,004 --> 01:16:25,199
Ah. Now, let's be kind to Gus.

1321
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:27,036
He is our friend.

1322
01:16:37,617 --> 01:16:40,484
Hank, don't kill me, man.

1323
01:16:40,519 --> 01:16:41,952
I got no choice, man.

1324
01:16:41,987 --> 01:16:43,318
I don't want to die!

1325
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:45,789
<i>We'll take care
of your wife in Jersey.</i>

1326
01:16:45,823 --> 01:16:50,260
Gus, baby,
you're giving dying a bad name.

1327
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:54,725
- Come on, Hank, get him!
- I'm doing the best I can, man!

1328
01:16:54,764 --> 01:16:56,493
What do you want? Hold him.

1329
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:58,865
- Hold his head down.
- Come on, Hank!

1330
01:16:58,902 --> 01:17:00,733
Come on, Gus, die!

1331
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:02,760
Come on, hold him, Jodie!

1332
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:09,040
Everybody happy?

1333
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:18,275
You're just in time.

1334
01:17:18,318 --> 01:17:20,377
<i>That's everyone
except Gus and the girl.</i>

1335
01:17:25,124 --> 01:17:27,490
Parsons-number six.

1336
01:17:27,525 --> 01:17:29,288
Don't make no noise.

1337
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:30,624
This guy is dangerous.

1338
01:17:30,662 --> 01:17:32,152
No noise.

1339
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,392
No noise.

1340
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,207
Yes?

1341
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:51,371
Shh.

1342
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:53,608
Is that you, Imabelle?!
It's me... Jackson, baby!

1343
01:17:53,648 --> 01:17:55,639
I've come here to rescue you!

1344
01:17:55,683 --> 01:17:56,809
Daddy!

1345
01:17:56,851 --> 01:18:00,252
Yeah, you be Daddy.
I'm gonna check the gold!

1346
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:02,016
We gotta go.

1347
01:18:02,055 --> 01:18:03,613
Oh, shit.

1348
01:18:04,924 --> 01:18:07,484
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1349
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:09,017
Oh, God.

1350
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:11,154
Oh, God!

1351
01:18:11,196 --> 01:18:12,925
I didn't do it, officer.

1352
01:18:12,965 --> 01:18:14,159
Jackson!

1353
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:16,565
That ain't no officer.
This is my stepbrother Sherman.

1354
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:18,159
Oh, good.
Then you're just in time...

1355
01:18:18,202 --> 01:18:19,499
to help me get
that trunk outta here.

1356
01:18:19,537 --> 01:18:21,528
That's just what
we was intending on doing.

1357
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,563
And then what was you intending
on doing with it?

1358
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:25,598
Don't worry
about that right now!

1359
01:18:25,642 --> 01:18:27,371
I got him under control.
I just want you...

1360
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,002
to get outta here
before they come back in.

1361
01:18:29,045 --> 01:18:30,376
You go downstairs
and you wait in the hearse.

1362
01:18:30,412 --> 01:18:33,176
You take this trunk down,
and we'll be right behind you.

1363
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,842
Heh heh heh heh.

1364
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:39,314
What do you mean,
you got me under control?

1365
01:18:39,354 --> 01:18:41,015
You ain't got me under control.

1366
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:43,046
You gotta get her
under control. Come on.

1367
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:55,195
Hey, baby girl!
Where you think you going?

1368
01:18:55,234 --> 01:18:57,259
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1369
01:18:59,805 --> 01:19:02,137
<i>You come here!</i>

1370
01:19:02,174 --> 01:19:06,133
Please! No! Aah!

1371
01:19:11,115 --> 01:19:15,074
Hold her, Jodie!

1372
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:18,212
You know you hurt me, girl,
when you do this kind of shit.

1373
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,552
You hurt me deep.

1374
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:30,092
Aah!

1375
01:19:31,465 --> 01:19:33,558
Here, here, here.
Let me help you.

1376
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,033
Where is she?

1377
01:19:35,068 --> 01:19:37,127
- She took off.
- What, she go back in?

1378
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:40,071
Here. I don't...
I don't think so.

1379
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:42,699
Well, she got to be around here
somewhere. Where is she?

1380
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:44,902
<i>She took off up the street.</i>

1381
01:19:46,345 --> 01:19:48,245
How about we come back for her?

1382
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:50,679
I ain't going nowhere.
I ain't leaving her.

1383
01:19:50,715 --> 01:19:52,842
I came here to get her.

1384
01:19:52,884 --> 01:19:55,352
Jackson. Shit!

1385
01:19:57,521 --> 01:19:59,489
Did you see that?

1386
01:19:59,523 --> 01:20:01,753
- We're not leaving him.
- No, no, no.

1387
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,021
You think I'm going
to leave my stepbrother?

1388
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,857
I told you we were going
to get that gold, didn't I?

1389
01:20:05,895 --> 01:20:07,658
Yeah. Just hurry up
so we can keep it, eh?

1390
01:20:07,697 --> 01:20:09,597
I'll get him.
We'll be right back.

1391
01:20:15,236 --> 01:20:18,603
- Jackson!
- Jesus.

1392
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,664
Jackson, what are you doing?

1393
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:24,144
She's gone... and I love her.

1394
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:27,544
I know that, I know that,
but the gold is back there...

1395
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,842
and it's just begging
for trouble.

1396
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:32,146
You don't get the gold
unless I found Imabelle!

1397
01:20:32,184 --> 01:20:33,811
I did find you Imabelle.

1398
01:20:33,852 --> 01:20:35,683
Well, where is she?

1399
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,382
Come on, man.
She don't want to stay found.

1400
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:40,720
Shit, she ran away.

1401
01:20:40,758 --> 01:20:42,988
Get that into your head, man.
She don't want to be with you.

1402
01:20:43,026 --> 01:20:47,190
You don't know nothing
about love!

1403
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:50,393
All you know is whores.

1404
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,458
Don't you tell me...

1405
01:20:53,502 --> 01:20:55,561
about my head.

1406
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:58,164
You know, Jackson,
you're just like Mama.

1407
01:20:58,206 --> 01:21:00,106
Don't talk about Ma!

1408
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:05,044
You do not talk
about my mother.

1409
01:21:05,078 --> 01:21:08,206
Hey, fuck you!
She was my mama, too!

1410
01:21:08,248 --> 01:21:10,079
And I loved her
just as much as you did!

1411
01:21:10,117 --> 01:21:11,550
You didn't even go
to the funeral.

1412
01:21:11,584 --> 01:21:13,176
I'll bet you ain't
even been to the...

1413
01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:16,086
to the grave site once.

1414
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:18,488
I've been...

1415
01:21:18,523 --> 01:21:20,252
I've been to the grave site.

1416
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,987
<i>I've been there!</i>

1417
01:21:34,737 --> 01:21:37,934
Is that our gold
in the back of that hearse?

1418
01:21:37,974 --> 01:21:40,067
Damn straight, it is.

1419
01:22:00,926 --> 01:22:03,417
You got to hold me
so tight, Jodie?

1420
01:22:03,462 --> 01:22:06,590
Hope your lips don't give me
no shit, big mouth.

1421
01:22:17,274 --> 01:22:19,333
Uhh! Uhh!

1422
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:24,477
<i>Ima, get out of here!</i>

1423
01:22:24,513 --> 01:22:26,913
Bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up!

1424
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:28,678
Come here, shorty,
I'll show you something.

1425
01:22:28,717 --> 01:22:31,584
Come here, come here.
You want to see this, huh?

1426
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:33,553
Yo.

1427
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:36,079
Think about this, brother.
Just think about this.

1428
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:37,613
You think about this right now.

1429
01:22:37,658 --> 01:22:40,456
Take your best shot, sucker.

1430
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:42,052
Ohm

1431
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:44,495
Oh, no, no.
You get up here, boy.

1432
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:46,054
Stand up there.

1433
01:22:46,099 --> 01:22:47,964
Uhh!

1434
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:49,935
Uhh!

1435
01:22:49,968 --> 01:22:51,435
<i>Hit him again.</i>

1436
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,734
Ohh.

1437
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,003
I thought I recognized
that voice.

1438
01:22:58,042 --> 01:23:00,909
This the bitch who run
the cathouse we were at.

1439
01:23:00,945 --> 01:23:03,004
<i>- Nah.
- Yeah.</i>

1440
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:07,847
Last time I saw you,
you was dressed as a woman.

1441
01:23:07,884 --> 01:23:11,445
- Disgusting.
- Ain't that right, bitch?

1442
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,081
Jackson, look...

1443
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,086
I'm sorry, Jackson. I'm sorry.

1444
01:23:20,828 --> 01:23:22,591
<i>I should've gone
to the funeral.</i>

1445
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,996
<i>I didn't go. I didn't want
to embarrass everybody.</i>

1446
01:23:25,032 --> 01:23:28,092
I know how everybody
in the family feels about me.

1447
01:23:31,137 --> 01:23:33,935
I should've been there.

1448
01:23:33,973 --> 01:23:35,964
I'm sorry.

1449
01:23:36,008 --> 01:23:37,976
Jackson!

1450
01:23:39,077 --> 01:23:40,601
<i>Jackson!</i>

1451
01:23:42,747 --> 01:23:46,080
- I thought you were gone.
- Oh, Jackson! Jackson!

1452
01:23:46,116 --> 01:23:47,947
<i>They're trying to kill
your friend, Jackson.</i>

1453
01:23:47,985 --> 01:23:49,680
They're trying to kill
your friend!

1454
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,880
Kathy!

1455
01:23:52,355 --> 01:23:53,720
Wait a minute.

1456
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:58,093
It's your last time, punk.

1457
01:23:58,127 --> 01:24:01,858
You talk to me, or I'm going
to let him fuck you up.

1458
01:24:01,897 --> 01:24:06,527
Where's Jackson
and the other phony cop?

1459
01:24:06,567 --> 01:24:08,899
Fuck you.

1460
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:15,065
Hmm. Pop go the weasel.

1461
01:24:16,276 --> 01:24:18,540
No...

1462
01:24:18,578 --> 01:24:22,309
fuck you.

1463
01:24:22,347 --> 01:24:24,076
Uhh.

1464
01:24:25,384 --> 01:24:27,079
<i>Uhh.</i>

1465
01:24:28,872 --> 01:24:31,705
Kathy! Kathy!

1466
01:24:36,545 --> 01:24:38,137
God!

1467
01:24:44,252 --> 01:24:45,583
Kathy.

1468
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,252
- It's me.
- Boss...

1469
01:24:49,289 --> 01:24:51,553
- it's Goldy.
- Uhh.

1470
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:54,059
Come on, man.
Come on, Kathy. Don't die.

1471
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:56,062
You hear what I'm saying?

1472
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:59,258
Don't die, OK?

1473
01:24:59,298 --> 01:25:00,595
Kathy...

1474
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:08,567
OK. OK. I'm going
to close your eyes.

1475
01:25:13,944 --> 01:25:15,639
Sherman.

1476
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,549
I want those murdering
bastard friends of yours...

1477
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,148
and you're going to take me
to them right now!

1478
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,919
No, don't. Sherman, don't.

1479
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:34,151
Jackson, Jackson,
you all right?

1480
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,288
Baby, you all right?

1481
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:39,457
<i>- Get your hands off of me!
- Don't hurt her.</i>

1482
01:25:39,499 --> 01:25:40,796
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1483
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:42,426
Take it easy?!

1484
01:25:42,469 --> 01:25:46,303
I took it easy back there
jerking around with you...

1485
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:50,035
<i>when I should've been watching
out for my real family.</i>

1486
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:52,908
Yeah, man, make a move...

1487
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:56,471
so I can blow her fucking brains
out on the sidewalk.

1488
01:25:56,514 --> 01:26:00,348
Make a fucking move!

1489
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,248
I'm sorry.

1490
01:26:09,225 --> 01:26:10,317
Sherman!

1491
01:26:13,695 --> 01:26:15,856
You know, you take
that gun off my head...

1492
01:26:15,897 --> 01:26:17,694
I'll have an easier time
driving.

1493
01:26:17,732 --> 01:26:19,093
I mean,
it's kind of distracting...

1494
01:26:19,099 --> 01:26:20,964
Shut up, bitch!

1495
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:23,765
The only person I ever cared
about in this whole world...

1496
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:25,829
just died because of
your worthless ass!

1497
01:26:25,872 --> 01:26:28,898
I don't like what they did
any more than you...

1498
01:26:28,941 --> 01:26:30,431
but what do I get out of this?

1499
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:32,171
We're gonna play a game,
you and me.

1500
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,973
I don't know how many bullets
in this fucking gun...

1501
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:36,139
but we're gonna play a game,
you and me.

1502
01:26:36,181 --> 01:26:37,671
You wanna play?

1503
01:26:37,716 --> 01:26:39,445
- Yeah!
- Let's play!

1504
01:26:39,483 --> 01:26:42,008
Don't fuck with me!

1505
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:53,927
<i>Um!</i>

1506
01:26:53,962 --> 01:26:56,931
Fuck!

1507
01:26:56,965 --> 01:26:59,024
You kill me,
you don't get nothing.

1508
01:26:59,067 --> 01:27:01,934
Not even revenge.

1509
01:27:01,969 --> 01:27:04,335
What do you want?

1510
01:27:04,372 --> 01:27:06,567
I want a fifty-fifty split.

1511
01:27:06,607 --> 01:27:09,201
- Uh-uh.
- I planned that robbery.

1512
01:27:09,242 --> 01:27:11,403
Pad of that money's mine.

1513
01:27:11,444 --> 01:27:14,607
You tell me where they are,
it's a deal.

1514
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:19,880
No. I go with you all the way.

1515
01:27:22,253 --> 01:27:24,278
All right.

1516
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,950
<i>All right, it's a deal.</i>

1517
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,951
But you fuck with me...

1518
01:27:35,231 --> 01:27:40,225
and I'm gonna do to you what
your boyfriend did to Big Kathy.

1519
01:27:51,812 --> 01:27:53,973
152 grand. Ha ha!

1520
01:27:56,816 --> 01:28:00,377
Too bad you didn't
bring your lady friend.

1521
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:04,413
I had another dream about her.

1522
01:28:04,456 --> 01:28:09,291
Ahh... hoo, shit!
I can't tell you about it.

1523
01:28:09,328 --> 01:28:12,593
You were in it,
weren't you, baby?

1524
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,699
<i>Yeah, you were.</i>

1525
01:28:20,236 --> 01:28:21,430
Listen...

1526
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:25,564
I'm quite fed up with you...

1527
01:28:26,742 --> 01:28:29,836
Diddling with your
little rat dog there...

1528
01:28:31,346 --> 01:28:33,906
And running your mouth
all over my woman.

1529
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:37,008
You stop that shit.

1530
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:39,952
God damn it, Slim. Calm down.

1531
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:43,616
You stop that shit!

1532
01:28:51,564 --> 01:28:54,294
Come on, Slim.
We done come too far.

1533
01:29:04,241 --> 01:29:07,369
You better get
some etiquette classes...

1534
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:10,811
before you try and do business
in the big city, boy.

1535
01:29:10,847 --> 01:29:13,111
Boy?

1536
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,378
You see a boy?

1537
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,981
Grave Digger Jones here.

1538
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:24,150
- It's Goldy.
- Goldy! Where the fuck are you?

1539
01:29:24,191 --> 01:29:27,024
<i>Bastards killed Big Kathy,
and I'm gonna pay 'em back.</i>

1540
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,028
<i>If you and Coffin Ed
can stop thinking...</i>

1541
01:29:29,062 --> 01:29:31,792
about shooting my ass,
I think I can do you a favor.

1542
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:32,991
All right, go on.

1543
01:29:33,033 --> 01:29:35,627
Some people are gonna have
to die on this one.

1544
01:29:35,668 --> 01:29:37,033
As long as it ain't me or Ed...

1545
01:29:37,069 --> 01:29:39,230
I don't give a shit.
Just pan of the job.

1546
01:29:47,278 --> 01:29:53,012
No sense in getting our heads
worked up over business.

1547
01:29:55,918 --> 01:29:57,647
That's right! Ha ha ha!

1548
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:04,191
Eh, your friend Imabelle...

1549
01:30:04,225 --> 01:30:08,355
already got another pan
of me worked up...

1550
01:30:08,396 --> 01:30:13,356
and it ain't my head.
Ha ha ha!

1551
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,163
Ha ha ha!

1552
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:18,837
- That's it!
- That's what?

1553
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,600
- That's it!
- What?

1554
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,505
I done told you.

1555
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,009
<i>Jodie, talk to him!</i>

1556
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:25,942
Pop go the weasel!

1557
01:30:25,977 --> 01:30:28,537
- What you talking about, Slim?
- Pop go the weasel!

1558
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:31,447
- We come too far for this!
- No! Pop go the weasel!

1559
01:30:31,482 --> 01:30:34,246
Save that nursery school shit
for Mississippi, chump.

1560
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,048
- Chump?!
- Yeah! Chump. Pussy!

1561
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,285
You don't know me that well.

1562
01:30:42,325 --> 01:30:44,793
- He didn't mean nothing by that.
- Aw, pussy, get outta here!

1563
01:30:44,827 --> 01:30:46,727
- That's it!
- It can't be it! Come on, y'all!

1564
01:30:46,762 --> 01:30:50,459
Pop go the weasel!
Pop go the motherfucking weasel!

1565
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:53,562
Slim! Aah!

1566
01:31:00,574 --> 01:31:01,734
Damn it!

1567
01:31:09,648 --> 01:31:13,812
<i>Uhh! Baby! Not the dog.</i>

1568
01:31:15,019 --> 01:31:18,318
Don't touch the dog.

1569
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:23,819
<i>Don't worry, baby.
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you.</i>

1570
01:31:25,262 --> 01:31:27,127
Don't shoot my dog, man.

1571
01:31:27,163 --> 01:31:29,893
<i>That's where I draw the line.</i>

1572
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:31,627
<i>That just ain't right.</i>

1573
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:33,430
I'll give you
the motherfucking money...

1574
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:35,902
you can walk out of here...

1575
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:39,600
just don't let me see you
shooting no dog.

1576
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:43,235
I want the money
and I want the gold.

1577
01:31:43,277 --> 01:31:45,336
Now, you know I can't do that.

1578
01:31:45,379 --> 01:31:48,007
Fine. Then I'm gonna
kill your rat.

1579
01:31:48,047 --> 01:31:50,106
All right! All right!
All right!

1580
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:53,415
Take the money and the gold
and get out of town.

1581
01:31:56,488 --> 01:31:59,082
Now, just put my dog down.

1582
01:31:59,124 --> 01:32:01,922
<i>- Put your gun down.
- I'll put the gun down.</i>

1583
01:32:01,959 --> 01:32:03,984
Step away from it!

1584
01:32:04,028 --> 01:32:07,054
All right, I put my gun down.

1585
01:32:07,098 --> 01:32:09,464
Please put my dog down.

1586
01:32:13,703 --> 01:32:15,193
Here, baby.

1587
01:32:15,237 --> 01:32:16,329
No!

1588
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:22,609
- Goldy, you all right?
- Imabelle!

1589
01:32:22,644 --> 01:32:24,771
Imabelle, come here!

1590
01:32:26,047 --> 01:32:28,379
You want this?
You want me?

1591
01:32:28,415 --> 01:32:30,849
- Baby...
- Motherfucker!

1592
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:35,617
- You want some more? Here!
- Forgive me, baby.

1593
01:32:35,655 --> 01:32:38,522
Imabelle! God damn it! Shit!

1594
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:43,354
God damn it! Shit!

1595
01:32:43,395 --> 01:32:46,831
You still carry this? Ha ha!

1596
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:49,527
- Let her go, god damn it!
- Fuck you!

1597
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:02,311
Let her go!
I'll kill her, I swear!

1598
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,375
You kill her!

1599
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:08,251
Ain't that your woman?
Huh? I'll kill her!

1600
01:33:08,288 --> 01:33:09,846
Go on and kill her!

1601
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:17,926
You killed him, didn't you?

1602
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:21,193
<i>Who, your girlfriend?</i>

1603
01:33:21,232 --> 01:33:23,291
You killed Big Kathy.

1604
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:25,564
You cut his throat,
you bastard!

1605
01:33:25,602 --> 01:33:28,935
What, you grieving
'cause that he-bitch is dead?

1606
01:33:28,972 --> 01:33:31,805
I'm gonna put you
out your misery.

1607
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:35,775
<i>Slim!</i>

1608
01:33:40,415 --> 01:33:44,476
Hey, baby, there he is,
Simple Simon.

1609
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:48,114
You let him be!

1610
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:50,123
It's me you want.

1611
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:54,560
That's right. It's you I want.

1612
01:33:54,594 --> 01:33:58,086
Jackson,
shoot this motherfucker!

1613
01:33:58,131 --> 01:34:01,760
I don't need this
to do what I got to do.

1614
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:06,897
Jackson, you need that!
Shoot this bastard!

1615
01:34:06,937 --> 01:34:11,340
You put the razor down.

1616
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:14,833
I'll put the gun down.

1617
01:34:14,878 --> 01:34:19,645
I'll fight you for her...
like a man.

1618
01:34:19,682 --> 01:34:23,311
For as God is my judge...

1619
01:34:23,352 --> 01:34:25,820
I love you
more than life itself.

1620
01:34:25,854 --> 01:34:27,879
- Oh, Jackson...
- Shut up, bitch!

1621
01:34:27,922 --> 01:34:30,891
Like a good dog,
you stay right there.

1622
01:34:40,867 --> 01:34:42,357
Huh! Uhh!

1623
01:34:43,869 --> 01:34:46,667
You ain't no man.
I ain't even armed.

1624
01:34:46,705 --> 01:34:51,733
I can't believe you'd say
no funky shit like that.

1625
01:34:51,776 --> 01:34:53,243
Ha ha ha!

1626
01:34:53,278 --> 01:34:56,042
- Jackson, run! Run outta here!
- You stay outta this!

1627
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,414
<i>? All around
the mulberry bush ?</i>

1628
01:35:02,085 --> 01:35:05,350
Yea, though I walk
through the valley...

1629
01:35:05,388 --> 01:35:08,255
<i>I The monkey
chased the weasel ?</i>

1630
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:10,782
Aah!

1631
01:35:10,826 --> 01:35:14,091
This dance for you, baby girl!

1632
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:17,197
Uhh!

1633
01:35:17,231 --> 01:35:18,562
Aah!

1634
01:35:18,599 --> 01:35:21,966
I will fear no evil...

1635
01:35:22,002 --> 01:35:24,732
The monkey thought
it was all in fun.

1636
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:27,569
In the house of the Lord.

1637
01:35:35,547 --> 01:35:37,208
We ain't gotta do this.

1638
01:35:37,248 --> 01:35:40,376
- No.
- Ain't gotta do this.

1639
01:35:40,418 --> 01:35:41,612
<i>Uhh!</i>

1640
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:46,047
All fall down!

1641
01:35:46,089 --> 01:35:47,351
Pop!

1642
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:48,652
Uhh!

1643
01:35:58,099 --> 01:36:00,260
<i>Uhh!</i>

1644
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:05,631
That'll be Grave Digger
and Coffin Ed.

1645
01:36:05,672 --> 01:36:08,766
I made a deal with them.
Told them about the gold...

1646
01:36:08,809 --> 01:36:12,176
but I didn't tell them nothing
about no money.

1647
01:36:12,211 --> 01:36:14,679
<i>You take this
and get on outta here!</i>

1648
01:36:14,714 --> 01:36:17,945
Listen to me. I want you
to stay behind this bar.

1649
01:36:17,984 --> 01:36:19,679
I'm gonna go out there
and make sure...

1650
01:36:19,718 --> 01:36:21,015
these cops
don't hurt my brother.

1651
01:36:21,052 --> 01:36:23,816
Here, take this.
Keep this safe.

1652
01:36:23,855 --> 01:36:26,187
No, what are you doing?

1653
01:36:26,223 --> 01:36:28,214
What are you doing?
You can't trust her!

1654
01:36:28,259 --> 01:36:30,090
Take that money
and get on outta here!

1655
01:36:30,127 --> 01:36:32,322
Sherman, why you always
gotta assume...

1656
01:36:32,363 --> 01:36:34,797
that everybody
is untrustworthy?

1657
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:35,957
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1658
01:36:37,467 --> 01:36:40,459
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

1659
01:36:40,502 --> 01:36:42,868
Can't you see
that this man is injured?

1660
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:44,839
Damn that man!
Where's the damn gold, sucker?

1661
01:36:44,873 --> 01:36:47,000
It's in Easy Money's office.

1662
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:49,805
Let's go! Let's go!
Move 'em out!

1663
01:36:49,844 --> 01:36:53,007
Let's go, Goldy!
You got blood, whatever!

1664
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:54,674
<i>Get on in there!</i>

1665
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,625
What did I tell you, huh?

1666
01:37:18,669 --> 01:37:20,296
She's inside.

1667
01:37:20,337 --> 01:37:22,237
She is gone.

1668
01:37:22,271 --> 01:37:24,705
She's inside.

1669
01:37:26,509 --> 01:37:28,340
She's inside.

1670
01:37:31,413 --> 01:37:32,710
Must have gotten delayed.

1671
01:37:32,747 --> 01:37:35,773
She's permanently delayed.
She skated with the money.

1672
01:37:35,816 --> 01:37:37,408
I gotta see a doctor.

1673
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:39,385
- Straighten up!
- Count off!

1674
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,320
We were admiring
the body count back there.

1675
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,323
<i>And what a nice day's
work you did.</i>

1676
01:37:43,356 --> 01:37:45,756
And how happy some undertaker
was gonna be...

1677
01:37:45,792 --> 01:37:49,523
when we remembered you was
wanted for robbing your boss.

1678
01:37:49,562 --> 01:37:51,587
<i>It was not part
of Goldy's deal.</i>

1679
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:54,656
- Come on, we're taking you in.
- Wait a minute!

1680
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:57,726
Are you resisting arrest?

1681
01:38:00,304 --> 01:38:04,035
I'm sorry, bros.
I'll do what I can.

1682
01:38:06,009 --> 01:38:10,571
Don't matter.
Nothing matters no more.

1683
01:38:16,585 --> 01:38:19,645
<i>Someday, Goldy, someday!</i>

1684
01:38:23,358 --> 01:38:25,883
<i>I want my phone call!</i>

1685
01:38:27,461 --> 01:38:30,259
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1686
01:38:33,165 --> 01:38:35,429
Get your ass up, sucker.

1687
01:38:41,306 --> 01:38:47,074
Who brought me these clothes,
made bail for me... a woman?

1688
01:38:47,111 --> 01:38:48,874
Hell, no.

1689
01:38:54,784 --> 01:38:55,944
Mr. Clay.

1690
01:38:55,985 --> 01:38:58,078
Well, well, well...

1691
01:38:58,121 --> 01:39:00,715
here's the big,
bad man himself.

1692
01:39:00,756 --> 01:39:03,384
Time you put
your six-shooter away...

1693
01:39:03,425 --> 01:39:05,256
and take out
your adding machine.

1694
01:39:05,294 --> 01:39:07,319
You drummed us up some work.

1695
01:39:07,361 --> 01:39:12,162
Two of them boys that was killed
was carrying eight grand apiece.

1696
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:15,464
<i>That money was just contributed
towards their funeral.</i>

1697
01:39:15,502 --> 01:39:19,165
Oh, by the way, a lovely,
lovely young lady...

1698
01:39:19,205 --> 01:39:23,005
came by the office
and asked me to give you...

1699
01:39:25,411 --> 01:39:27,743
The cross.

1700
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:29,303
Train station!

1701
01:39:29,347 --> 01:39:31,281
Where you think you going,
Jackson?

1702
01:39:31,316 --> 01:39:33,614
I just made your bail!

1703
01:39:35,152 --> 01:39:37,620
<i>Train 55,
bound for Mississippi...</i>

1704
01:39:37,654 --> 01:39:39,519
Here they are, Goldy.

1705
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:42,582
<i>leaving from platform 9.
AH aboard.</i>

1706
01:39:43,759 --> 01:39:44,726
Oh.

1707
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,988
Sherman,
what are you doing here?

1708
01:39:46,028 --> 01:39:48,326
Goddamn fool oughta be
getting some rest.

1709
01:39:48,364 --> 01:39:50,662
After you get shot,
it's always a good idea...

1710
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:52,360
to spend a few days in bed!

1711
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,699
Good God Almighty!
It's payday, man!

1712
01:39:55,736 --> 01:39:58,261
There's about
$50,000 here, man!

1713
01:39:58,305 --> 01:39:59,272
<i>Count yours.</i>

1714
01:39:59,306 --> 01:40:01,001
She says I'm too good for her.

1715
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:03,942
She's right!
But count the money, man!

1716
01:40:03,976 --> 01:40:05,807
Hey, have you seen a woman...

1717
01:40:05,845 --> 01:40:08,279
With the sweetest ass
God ever made?

1718
01:40:08,314 --> 01:40:11,647
I just took her to platform 9,
train bound for Mississippi.

1719
01:40:11,683 --> 01:40:15,346
Jackson! Jackson!

1720
01:40:15,387 --> 01:40:17,981
Jackson, this is fifty... oh!

1721
01:40:22,193 --> 01:40:25,651
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

1722
01:40:25,695 --> 01:40:28,027
Take this money now.
Big Kathy wants you to have it.

1723
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:30,498
- I don't want it!
- Wait a minute!

1724
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,332
Good luck, brother.

1725
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:35,928
You're gonna need it.
I love you.

1726
01:40:35,971 --> 01:40:38,132
God bless you.
God bless you, Goldy.

1727
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:40,538
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1728
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:45,543
He called me Goldy.

1729
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:47,410
Look at him. Look at him run!

1730
01:40:47,447 --> 01:40:49,005
In all the years
I know that chump...

1731
01:40:49,049 --> 01:40:50,676
I never seen him run so fast.

1732
01:40:53,786 --> 01:40:55,185
<i>If I had somebody like her...</i>

1733
01:40:55,221 --> 01:40:57,086
- Goldy!
- I'd run fast, too.

1734
01:40:57,123 --> 01:40:58,818
<i>Yeah, he'll be back.</i>

1735
01:40:58,857 --> 01:41:00,688
Jackson in Mississippi?

1736
01:41:00,725 --> 01:41:02,955
It's like getting change
from a penny.

1737
01:41:02,994 --> 01:41:06,225
You getting sentimental
on me, Goldy?

1738
01:41:06,263 --> 01:41:07,924
Yeah, a little bit.

1739
01:41:07,965 --> 01:41:11,128
But I'm recovering.
I'm recovering rapidly!

1740
01:41:11,168 --> 01:41:13,636
Money! There's a lot
of money here, ladies.

1741
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:15,136
I'm a very rich man.

1742
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:17,105
Look at those ladies.
Look at them!

1743
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,937
Yes! Money!

1744
01:41:31,152 --> 01:41:32,619
Excuse me.

1745
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:37,280
Does this belong to you?

1746
01:41:38,558 --> 01:41:40,856
Only you can answer that.

1747
01:41:45,664 --> 01:41:50,328
You know, Jackson...

1748
01:41:50,368 --> 01:41:52,359
you really don't know me.

1749
01:41:52,403 --> 01:41:54,997
Yes, I know...

1750
01:41:55,038 --> 01:41:57,097
but it's a long ride
to Mississippi.

1751
01:41:59,976 --> 01:42:03,173
Tell me. You know anybody
in Mississippi...

1752
01:42:03,212 --> 01:42:05,373
who does a good foot rubbing?

1753
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:12,986
Ahem. You know,
as a matter of fact...

1754
01:42:13,021 --> 01:42:15,751
I don't.

1755
01:42:19,793 --> 01:42:21,192
Mmm.

1756
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:26,924
That's too bad.

1757
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:34,562
'Cause my feet are killing me.

1758
01:43:12,175 --> 01:43:15,110
<i>? In your darkest of hours ?</i>

1759
01:43:15,145 --> 01:43:16,612

<i>? If you're looking
for something ?</i>

1763
01:43:23,986 --> 01:43:25,510
<i>? Don't look too far ?</i>

1764
01:43:25,553 --> 01:43:29,785
<i>? 'Cause the answer
is right where you are ?</i>

1765
01:43:29,824 --> 01:43:31,451
<i>? 'Cause heaven ?</i>

1766
01:43:31,493 --> 01:43:33,620

01:43:59,683 --> 01:44:01,150

01:44:04,254 --> 01:44:05,744
<i>? And see the light ?</i>

1776
01:44:05,789 --> 01:44:08,690
<i>? If your soul needs healing ?</i>

1777
01:44:08,724 --> 01:44:10,419
<i>? Here's what I say ?</i>

1778
01:44:10,459 --> 01:44:14,395
