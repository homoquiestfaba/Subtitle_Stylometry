00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,661
!Vuela la conga, muchachos!

3
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,480
!Conga! !Conga!

4
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,786
- God!
- So bloated.

5
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,331
- She's bingeing.
- Bingeing? She's fat.

6
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,384
Honey?

7
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,430
Whew! I thought
I lost ya, honey.

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,811
- God, I think it's a thyroid problem.
- I think she's just fat.

9
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,442
Oh, yeah.

10
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,510
What's wrong?
What's wrong, honey?

11
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:19,181
- It's too soon.
- Oh. Oh! Josh, come here!

12
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,603
Hold on, honey. Easy. Easy.

13
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,528
- Brian, what's happening?
- Help!

14
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,530
- I'm only in the first trimester.
- Help!

15
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,241
Would someone please help?
We have an emergency here. I think--

16
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,244
-Yeah, call the doctor.
-Um, please, could you call Dr Benfante?

17
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,080
- Help.
- Calm down. Now, now.

18
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,791
- Huh?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Help me!

19
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,585
- Help me.
- Over here. One at a time.

20
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,507
Dr Brandon--

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,426
- Come on, now!
- Put it over here.

22
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,972
- No, I don't have anything!
- Put it in the tray.
- Honey, it's your tin.

23
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,725
Huh? Oh!

24
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,894
Okay.

25
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,105
- It's okay.
- No smoking in the hospital.
- No, no. No smoking in here.

26
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,525
Put that out.

27
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,987
I'm gonna quit tomorrow.
I swear.

28
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,364
No, no, sideways.
Come through-- Tha-That's it.

29
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,826
- When are you due, ma'am?
- N-Not for another seven months.

30
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,884
- Susan, wh-where's Dr Benfante?
- Brian, come here.

31
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,844
- Just hold my hand.
- There we go.
- The l.V. set?

32
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:43,640
- Have you had Lamaze?
- Uh, well, I haven't even
signed up for the course yet.

33
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,059
I'm only two months along.

34
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,688
- That's the epidural talking.
- She hasn't had an epidural.

35
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,859
What are you babbling about?
It's-- It's too soon.

36
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,778
- It's too soon, Brian.
- Here he comes.

37
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,281
Okay, guys. Calm down.

38
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,618
- Take it easy.
Calm down, everybody. Calm down.
- And now a deep breath.

39
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,954
It's too early for contractions.

40
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,665
- Hold tight. Hold my hand, honey.
Hold my hand.
- All right.

41
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,168
- Let's just relax.
- That's right.

42
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,879
- Okay. Okay.
- Christ.
- Wait, wait.

43
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,173
- Wait, wait.
- You said, "Come back next week." Huh?

44
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,175
- Yeah.
- You said it was just fluid retention.

45
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,135
"Go home. Have fun."

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,388
- Yeah, I'm not having fun.
- Yeah, you gotta breathe.

47
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,142
Sonogram's fine, Doctor,
for a full-term pregnancy.

48
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,853
- Doc, what's going on?
- Okay, it's really important
that you relax and breathe.

49
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,813
- She's fully dilated.
- It's gonna be all right.

50
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,233
- Now you're gonna push.
- Push, okay? Yes.
- No. It's too soon.

51
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,361
- Push hard. Push. Hold it. Hold it.
- Push. Push. Push.

52
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,406
- Good girl.
- Give it all you got.
- No, it's too soon!

53
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,492
- One more time.
- One more deep breath.
- Deep breath in.

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,328
- One more. Deep breath.
- And out.
- Push.

55
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,665
Push.

56
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,763
Look at that.
You've got a baby.

57
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,268
It's a beautiful,
beautiful boy.

58
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,939
Hey there, bud.

59
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,192
Hi.

60
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,864
- Don't rust up on me now.
- I'm sorry.

61
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,911
We'll call him Jack.

62
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,582
What you gonna be
when you grow up

63
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,127
What you gonna do
when your time is up

64
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,547
What you gonna say
when things go wrong

65
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,258
What you gonna do
when it's all over

66
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,178
There's a road

67
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,931
Long and windin'

68
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,434
The lights are blindin'

69
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,022
But it gets there

70
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,358
Don't give up

71
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,904
Don't look back

72
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,657
There's a silver linin'

73
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,368
It's out there somewhere

74
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,790
Everybody wants an answer

75
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,252
Everybody needs a friend

76
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,464
We all need a shining star

77
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,800
On which we can depend

78
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,637
So tonight we're gonna wish

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,388
Upon a star

80
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,725
We never wished upon before

81
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,144
What you gonna be
when you grow up

82
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,773
- To find what you're lookin' for
- What you gonna do when your time is up

83
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,817
There'll be times

84
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,863
In your life

85
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:49,576
Yeah, when you'll
be dancing and shit

86
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,745
But you ain't gettin' it

87
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,790
Don't get disillusioned

88
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,836
No, don't expect too much

89
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,589
'Cause if what you have
is all you can get

90
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,343
Just keep on tryin'
It just ain't happened yet

91
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,305
Everybody wants to be a winner

92
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,767
Everybody has a dream

93
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,895
We all need a shining star

94
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,315
When things ain't what they seem

95
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,820
So tonight we're gonna
wish upon a star

96
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,657
We never wished upon before

97
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,498
I'm sorry this
has taken so long.

98
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:40,544
Like you, we're puzzled
by your son's premature birth.

99
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,966
This is Dr Lin. He's an
infant disorder specialist from Cornell.

100
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:50,971
I want to assure you both that
there is nothing debilitating
about your son's condition.

101
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,682
He's totally healthy
and normal in appearance...

102
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,101
alert and quite happy.

103
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,229
However, his cells are
developing at what we feel...

104
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,523
is four times the normal rate.

105
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,943
Even though your son was only
ten weeks old when he was born...

106
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:09,531
physically he was nine months
and ready to leave your womb.

107
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,410
Nature has given us all
an internal clock.

108
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,873
It meters out lifespan,
controls our growth.

109
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,375
Your son's internal clock...

110
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,129
seems to be ticking
faster than usual.

111
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,466
- But he's healthy?
- Absolutely.

112
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:34,056
I'm sorry.
I still don't understand.

113
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,350
I've never heard
anything like this before.

114
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,269
Well, quite frankly,
neither have we.

115
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,189
There are other aging syndromes
that we know of.

116
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,192
Progeria, for example, which is
very devastating to the child, but--

117
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,946
Jack's cells are replicating
at an unheard of rate.

118
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,865
Is he gonna age like this
the rest of his life?

119
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,493
Well, sir, this is
only speculation...

120
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,455
but, uh, we feel that
at age one...

121
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:02,626
your son may be physically
around age four.

122
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,795
And if this continues
throughout his life...

123
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,757
by the time he reaches
age ten, well, he could--

124
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,427
Appear to be
an ordinary, full-grown...

125
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,596
40-year-old man.

126
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,432
Are you serious?

127
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,066
That's where he lives, right
down the street my whole life...

128
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,528
and I didn't even know about it.

129
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,739
I don't believe any of it.
He's lying.

130
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,702
Yeah. He's not a monster.
There's no such thing.

131
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,873
I'm telling you.
He's our age, but he looks 40.

132
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,626
All hairy and everything.
He's like a freak or something.

133
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,963
Just like in that one movie.

134
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,717
- Which movie?
- Duh! The one--

135
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,387
- Sorry.
- The one with the freak in it.
What did I just say?

136
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,890
Oh. Oh, yeah, l-l saw that one.

137
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:01,018
You didn't see it. His mom wouldn't
let him see it 'cause he has nightmares.

138
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,689
- I mean you no harm.
- Why haven't we ever seen him then?

139
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,525
I heard he's got
all kinds of toys too.

140
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,485
His parents buy him everything.

141
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,947
If he's our age,
why ain't he in school?

142
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,993
Because he's dangerous.
He's huge enough to hurt other kids.

143
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,913
That's why they keep him locked up.

144
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,207
Friend.

145
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,251
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

146
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,673
A teacher comes
to his house every day.

147
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,767
Jack, you're not paying attention.

148
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,729
- Jack, you're not paying attention.
- Don't be afraid.

149
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,814
I saw him in the store
with his mom.

150
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,110
I thought it was her husband at first,
but he's like a giant boy.

151
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,447
- He shaves and stuff.
- There's no such thing as giants.

152
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,367
Well, how'd he get like that?

153
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,327
Maybe his mom took drugs.

154
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,372
Maybe it was that fertility junk,
and she was gonna have quintuplets...

155
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,543
but just turned into
one big baby.

156
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:12,548
- Doof.
- Oh, he sleeps up there.

157
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,385
He's a monstrosity.
That's why they hide him.

158
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,096
No wonder they keep him
outta school.

159
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,181
Maybe they got him chained up.

160
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,600
Maybe they only let him loose
once a day to eat.

161
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,103
Is that like a big pile
of bones in his backyard?

162
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,523
- Where? Uh, what?
l-l don't see anything.
- Look!

163
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,400
Look!

164
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,279
Look out!

165
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,824
Come on, Louis!

166
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,993
- We gotta-- We gotta get outta here!
- Oh, gross!

167
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,037
Come on, Louis!
He's watching you! Come on!

168
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,791
Come on!

169
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,399
Ow. Ow.

170
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,110
- What happened? What'd you do?
Where does it hurt?
- Ow!

171
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,739
- My knee.
- Let me see.

172
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,452
Well, it's not bleeding. Okay.

173
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,163
- It's not?
- I can fix it for you.
- Okay.

174
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,665
- I'll bite it.
- No, no. No, don't bite it.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,834
- I really do. I have to bite it.
- Don't.

176
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,920
- Yeah?
- It'll get infected.
- Oh, okay.

177
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,839
But this leg has got to come off.
I'll get your father's saw.

178
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,675
No, no. No, no, don't get that.

179
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,097
I saw-- I saw your butt.

180
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,434
- Yeah, you did.
- Sorry.

181
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,811
Let's see.

182
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,942
- What do you hear?
- Nothing. It's okay.

183
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,528
- How about the toes?
- The toes are okay. I can feel that.

184
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,196
- Here?
- I can feel that.
- How about that?

185
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,823
- That's o-- That's--
- Yeah? That's much better?

186
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,661
Oh, go--

187
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,997
- Now--
- That feels good now.

188
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,291
- I told you about those laces, champ.
- Yeah.

189
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,254
- Hmm?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- You did. Sorry.

190
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,889
- So, where were we?
- History.

191
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,934
History. Okay.

192
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,563
So, by the time he was 18...

193
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:37,484
the young Alexander
had already conquered
most of the Greek city states...

194
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,404
and some feel that
he had learned everything...

195
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,615
from his tutor, Aristotle.

196
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,120
Jack.

197
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,165
- Jack.
- Hmm?

198
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,793
- What did I just say?
- Aristotle.

199
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,839
- Where's Aristotle?
- Book.

200
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:03,010
- Where's Jack?
- Outside.

201
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,765
I think what you have
set up here is wonderful.

202
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,894
I'm not trying to take
anything away from that.

203
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,854
I know you're not.

204
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:18,025
But to say that Jack should start
going to public school is crazy.

205
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,030
Yeah, but because
a person is different...

206
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,324
you can't make
an outcast of him.

207
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,534
But we'll talk to the principal.

208
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,828
The principal will prepare
the students.

209
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,457
Mr Woodruff,
he's got a 5:00 shadow.

210
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,753
I don't think he can fit in.
I wish he could.

211
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,713
But nobody said
it would be easy.

212
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:45,135
Jack's developed defence mechanisms just
like any child with a shortcoming does.

213
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,638
I appreciate what
you're trying to do...

214
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:52,142
but Brian and l,
we've seen how people react.

215
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,102
We've been through this before.

216
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:58,065
I just don't want Jack...

217
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,567
to have to face that.

218
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:06,198
Look at his eyes.

219
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,408
His child's eyes.

220
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,122
Look at his eyes
when he sees other children.

221
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,295
His life moves faster than ours,
and he wants to lead a full life...

222
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,132
and I don't think you
ought to let it pass him by.

223
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,635
It's not fair.

224
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,524
- Marco.
- Polo.

225
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,994
I've found you now.

226
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,373
- Got ya!
- Gotta touch me!

227
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,964
Would you two
knock it off up there!

228
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,258
"You better knock it off up there!"

229
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,311
- Marco.
- Polo.

230
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,861
Gotcha! You're it!

231
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,531
Oh, honey. Are you okay?

232
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,909
Yeah, I'm okay.

233
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,582
You know, if something's wrong,
Jackie, you can tell me.

234
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,418
Mr Woodruff mentioned
something today.

235
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,758
What, honey? Huh?

236
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,594
You can tell me.

237
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,225
Mom, am I a giant?

238
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,936
No, of course not!

239
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:06,109
- Where did you hear that?
- Is that why I don't go to school?

240
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:11,323
Honey, I've told you.
It's lots of things.

241
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,825
What things?

242
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,996
We'll talk about this, okay?

243
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,415
When?

244
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,793
-Well, not right now. It's time for bed.
-Time for bed.

245
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,212
- Brush your teeth. Put down the lid.
- Brush your teeth. Put down the lid.

246
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,008
Good night, Mom.

247
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,440
Woodruff doesn't know
what he's talking about.

248
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,818
If he doesn't know what
he's talking about, then why
are we paying him all this money...

249
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,320
to tutor Jack?

250
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:55,742
I blame him, filling Jack's head
with all these ideas of going to school.

251
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,828
Imagine that.

252
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:01,290
A teacher wanting a kid
to go to school, hmm?

253
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,460
Where do they get such ideas?

254
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,963
That's how we do it?

255
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,549
Just throw him into school?

256
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,011
- Mm-hmm.
- You know how children are.

257
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,764
They make fun of
the fat kid and...

258
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,101
the kid who wears glasses.

259
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,938
What do you think they're gonna do
to a six-foot, hairy kid?

260
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,162
Mom, Dad.

261
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,873
Jackie? You okay, honey?

262
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,083
- Something wrong?
- Oh, I'm okay.

263
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,046
Just can't sleep.
I had a scary dream.

264
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,215
Can I sleep in here?

265
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,634
Uh, yeah. Of course, buddy.

266
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,594
Stimpy too?

267
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,804
- Sure.
- Okay.

268
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,098
Oh. Hey. Easy.

269
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,392
Okay.

270
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,365
Hey, come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

271
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,742
- Jackie. Go to sleep.
- Okay.

272
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,038
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetie.

273
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,415
Good night, Dad.

274
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,762
You sure he's ready for school?

275
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,099
Jackie'll be fine.

276
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,564
It's the rest of the world
I'm worried about.

277
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,543
Taking a look at traffic
approaching the Bay Bridge, not too bad.

278
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,920
The metering lights have been
switched on at the toll plaza.

279
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,756
The wait begins right about
the Oakland army base right now.

280
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,342
Marin County is under fog,
but the driving's at the speed limit...

281
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,179
down and across the Golden Gate Bridge
as you make your way into the city.

282
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,722
That's traffic.
Back to you, Rick.

283
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,141
Hey, it's Rick the Lip with you
on the "Z" Morning Zoo.

284
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,144
Another beautiful one out there
in the city by the bay.

285
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,771
And guess what.
We're still here.

286
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,149
How about that little wake-up call
that happened this morning at 5:00?

287
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,443
- Only 3.2 on the Richter scale,
but I tell you what...
- 3.2!

288
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,988
it was a big fat 10
on the scared-the-hell-outta-me scale.

289
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,116
- Didn't scare me!
- This man hasn't shaken
so much since I was single.

290
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,410
Hey, hey, you got someplace
to be at 7:00?

291
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,204
- Yeah, Rick, I gotta be at school!
- You're kidding. You're late.

292
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,706
- 7:05.
- I'm late?
- Get yourself outta bed.

293
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,458
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
- You got a whole day out there
waitin' for ya.

294
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,169
- Go! Yeah!
- I'm livin' it. Let's go!
- I'm livin' it, too, Rick!

295
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,171
- Let's do it, people.
- I'm gettin' to it, Rick!

296
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,131
Misunderstood
Got an--

297
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,634
I hate that song.

298
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,345
- There you go. Easy.
- Dad, let me do this on my own, okay?

299
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,430
- Well, just--
- Watch.
- Okay, okay, okay.

300
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,933
But ta-- Take it easy.
Take it easy.

301
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,601
- And--
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

302
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,394
- Dad, l-- Dad, Dad.
- Okay. Okay, just--
Okay, hold it. Hold it.

303
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,397
- Let me help you. Oh!
- Ow! Dad!

304
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,943
- Here. Oops. Put this little Kleenex--
- Okay, put that there.

305
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,987
- Ah. Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

306
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,531
Let me just get
that last little part there.

307
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,616
- Yeah, just finish up...
- Okay.
- and come on down.

308
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,701
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

309
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,224
- You psyched?
- Psyched.
- Okay.

310
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,106
Oh, wow.
Look at all those kids.

311
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,568
- Just remember, you can come
home anytime you want to.
- Uh-huh.

312
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,236
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.

313
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,613
I'm okay. Thanks, Dad.

314
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,748
Hold it, Jack!

315
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:16,003
Come here. Let me get this.
Okay. Here we go.

316
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,346
- Come on.
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...

317
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,266
of the United States of America.

318
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,103
- And to the republic--
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.

319
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:37,274
- One nation, under God--
- Thank you, Mr and Mrs Powell and Jack.

320
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,568
Jack, how nice to see you.

321
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:43,864
I'm Mr McGee.
I've heard so much about you, Jack.

322
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,824
- Hello, Mr Magoo.
- McGee.

323
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,910
- Oh. McGee.
- Yes.
- Magoo.

324
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:51,788
Jack, how would you like
to see your classroom? Yes?

325
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,168
- Yes.
- A little louder.

326
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,379
- Yes.
- A little louder, Jack.

327
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,299
Yes!

328
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,301
Follow me.

329
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,138
- Is he deaf?
- It's okay.

330
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:12,518
- Tell me, Jack.
What do you think of it so far?
- Humongous heck-a-cool.

331
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:16,271
It is "heck-a-cool"
and a wonderful school.

332
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,150
A fun school, an upbeat school.

333
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:23,278
And I hope you'll have
the time of your life here.

334
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:27,866
You'll have some wonderful
teachers and wonderful pupils.

335
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,452
- And you're going to be one of them.
- Wow!

336
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:34,957
Here's your classroom right here.
Miss Marquez.

337
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,334
One second. Honey,
you want to be buttoned up, don't ya?

338
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,336
- Too tight.
- That too tight? All right.
- Okay.

339
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,382
- Don't give me a snuggie.
- Okay.

340
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,676
Mom, don't. That's gross.
You're embarrassing me.

341
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:49,012
Listen, honey,
if anybody's mean with you...

342
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:53,600
you just tell your teacher and someone
will call me and, and I'll kill 'em.

343
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,896
- Karen.
- Now are you ready, Jack?

344
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,359
Yes. Um--

345
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,862
Are there any other questions?

346
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,328
Miss Marquez, excuse me, but your new
student, Jack Powell, has just arrived.

347
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,331
Jack, this is Miss Marquez...

348
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,834
your fifth grade teacher.

349
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,461
Come in, please.

350
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,173
Don't be shy.

351
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,765
Come in, Jack. Come in.

352
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,067
Whoa! No way.

353
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,532
- Jeez, he looks like my dad.
- Except hairier.

354
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,163
Come on. It's okay.

355
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,790
Welcome to our class.
I'm glad you're here.

356
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,919
This place is for fun.

357
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,339
Everybody, this is Jack Powell.

358
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,469
Class-- "Hi, Jack."

359
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,640
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi.
- Hi, Jack.

360
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,934
Hi.

361
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,937
All right. Uh, I know some of
you must be curious about Jack.

362
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,356
So, why don't we just take
some time right now...

363
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,776
and ask him some of the questions
that you've got on your minds.

364
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,487
- Is that all right with you, Jack?
- Sure.

365
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:31,406
- Okay.
- I don't mind.

366
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,700
Go on. Ask him something.

367
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:37,037
- I'm not askin' him.
- Louis?

368
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,916
Anybody?

369
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:44,044
Come on.
Since when is this group shy?

370
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:47,881
All right. Fine. I've got plenty of
questions. Jack, when's your birthday?

371
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,175
Mm, September 12th.

372
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,261
1902.

373
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,097
That's enough. Hmm, let me see.

374
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,725
Uh, oh! What kind of foods
do you just hate?

375
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:02,062
- Broccoli.
- Broccoli, yuck!
- Makes you fart.

376
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,816
Anybody else here hate broccoli?

377
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,110
Hands. Yeah.

378
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,320
Uh-huh.

379
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,657
Well, it looks like you've got
more in common than you think.

380
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,496
Jack, your seat's right there
in the back. Why don't you go
sit down and we'll get started.

381
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,790
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,590
All right. Everybody,
take out your giant book--

383
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,092
I mean, your geography book.

384
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,891
Turn to page 78.

385
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:41,059
Okay. So, what we
found out the other day...

386
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:44,521
was that the name "California"
was initially used for--

387
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,899
- Everybody, calm down. Come on.
- I think he's stuck.

388
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,235
Was used for what we know today
as Baja California.

389
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,863
It was first used by Cortez
in the 1530s...

390
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:57,743
and was found in the journal
of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo in 1542.

391
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:01,205
Victor, eyes up front!
Everybody! Come on now. Calm down.

392
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,707
Timber!

393
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,378
Jack, are you okay?

394
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,840
- Are you all right, sweetie?
- Oh, man!

395
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,800
Are you sure you
don't need my help?

396
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,323
- You okay, Jack?
- I'm okay.

397
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,745
Jack.

398
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,300
Is he in our class?

399
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,979
Hot, hot, hot. Almost.

400
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:12,818
Shoot. Ooh-ooh. Ah.

401
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,956
Dog always gets 'em.

402
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,378
Oh, man, he's lookin' at us.

403
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,797
He probably recognizes us
from the street.

404
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,175
He's probably planning on
kicking our butts or something.

405
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,617
- Hey, punk, why don't you watch
where my ball is going?
- You're funny, Victor!

406
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:04,870
Maybe if you knew
how to play the game.

407
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,039
- What was that?
- You heard me.

408
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,584
You know what the problem is, Victor?
You have "Zackly" disease.

409
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,794
- What's that?
- Yeah, what's that?

410
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,589
It means your mouth smells
"zackly" Iike your butt.

411
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,300
- Oh-ho!
- Shut up! That's pathetic.
- Shut up.

412
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,302
That's so funny
I forgot to laugh.

413
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,471
- Losers say, "What?"
- What?

414
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,307
- Losers!
- Loser!

415
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,353
You think you're so tough?
Take it out on the court,
'cause I can whup your butt.

416
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,689
- Yeah!
- We can do it, man. Let's go.
- Come on, John-John.
- Let's kick their butt! Yeah!

417
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:36,360
Why does he always have to drag me
along? You know he's gonna cream us.

418
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,908
Ow! Don't!

419
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,619
- Are you a freak?
- No.

420
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,747
Oh. Well, Jane says
that you're a freak.

421
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,875
- Who's Jane?
- I'm Jane, and I think you are a freak.

422
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,795
Look at your hairy arms
and your eyebrows and--

423
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,214
Yeah, he has receding hairline.

424
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,716
Well, I'm not a freak.

425
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:04,304
Don't, or I'll tell!

426
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,307
- How old are you?
- I'm ten.

427
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,518
- How old are you?
- I'm eight.

428
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,478
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

429
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,023
- So?
- You don't look ten.

430
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,442
Look. You got the hairy arms.

431
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,820
You got hairy knuckles.

432
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,322
You look a lot older than us.

433
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,659
It looks like you shave there.

434
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,953
Yeah, I do. So?

435
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,998
A ten-year-old doesn't shave,
so then you can't be ten.

436
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:35,794
Yeah, you can't be ten if you
shave and you have hairy arms
and you're tall, really tall...

437
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,589
- For real.
- and you're bigger.
- Yeah.

438
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:42,968
- So I'm big for my age.
- Look. You have no hair.

439
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,970
- You ha--
- I have hair. I got hair. See? Look.

440
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,307
Yeah, but look. Right here you have
no hair. It looks like you're bald.

441
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,561
I'm not bald, and I'm not a freak.
You're a freak, four eyes.

442
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:57,274
He's ten, a whole two years
older than us. See?

443
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:01,111
Oh, sure. Like that
explains it. Please.

444
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,031
"Please."

445
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,330
Don't poke me, or I'm telling.

446
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:16,043
Over here! Yeah!

447
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:18,754
- Oh, yeah?
- Losers. Yeah, losers!

448
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,302
Shut up, you brat!

449
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,811
Hey, how about a little help?

450
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,900
- Throw it over.
- Yeah, throw it over.

451
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,659
Wait! I'm not touchin'
that thing.

452
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,744
It's been contaminated
now that he's touched it.

453
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,664
- Yeah, I ain't touchin' it.
- Oh, my God!
- Me neither!

454
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:56,917
- I ain't-- Uh! I ain't playin'
basketball for a week.
- Me too!

455
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,963
- Five weeks!
- Cooties!

456
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,257
Cooties! Cooties!

457
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,865
Jack? Honey?

458
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,743
I made sloppy joes for dinner.

459
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,163
I'm not hungry, Mom.

460
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,709
- Really juicy ones.
- Yeah?

461
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:41,837
- You're gonna love it.
- No, I won't.

462
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:45,174
- Guess what I made for dessert.
- What?

463
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,052
Ya have to guess.

464
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,766
- Can you smell it?
- Not through a box.

465
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:58,228
Chocolate pudding!

466
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,356
- Your favourite.
- Not any more, Mom.

467
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,276
It's still hot.

468
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,696
Mmm! I can smell it.
It's steaming.

469
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,990
No, thanks.

470
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:29,301
- This is serious.
- What happened?

471
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,347
What do you think happened?
Children whispering. Children pointing.

472
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:36,266
- Oh.
- He's not used to that, Brian.

473
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,977
Karen.

474
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:44,525
Jack?

475
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,950
Hey, your mom made sloppy joes.

476
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,786
Mom hates sloppy joes.

477
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,163
Uh, that's true.

478
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:00,582
In fact, all adults
hate sloppy joes...

479
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,876
but sometimes we make 'em
to cheer up a kid who's had a bad day.

480
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,254
- You want to tell me about it?
- No.

481
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,881
Okay.

482
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,135
You know what I was
just thinkin' about?

483
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,763
- First time you ever rode
a bike. You remember that?
- Oh, yeah.

484
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:19,643
Yeah. I mean, you,
you were so determined to ride.

485
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,854
- You kept wipin' out and--
- Yeah.

486
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,024
You nearly took out
a couple of the neighbours.

487
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,527
It took a couple of days
until you finally got it.

488
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:33,198
But look at you now. I mean, you--
you're, you're riding like a pro.

489
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:40,622
- Kinda like school, isn't it?
- Yeah.

490
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:45,502
Well, anyway, I just wanted
to see how you were doin'.

491
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,338
You need anything,
give me a holler.

492
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:57,306
Hey, Dad, could we
put up a basketball hoop?

493
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:01,894
Yeah.

494
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,773
All right. Get the ball.

495
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,833
- Hi.
- I'll be back in a second.

496
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,221
Hey in there.
How ya doin', Jack?

497
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,515
Hi, Miss Marquez.

498
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,899
Oh, are those Gummi Bears?

499
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:52,027
Could I have a red one?
The red ones are my favourite.

500
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,866
Yeah? Oh. Thanks.

501
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:08,085
So, how do you like it so far?

502
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,298
- Miss Marquez and Jack
- Marquez and Jack

503
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,384
Sittin' in a tree

504
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:18,929
K-l-S-S-l-N-G

505
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:22,891
- Girls!
- First comes love, then comes marriage

506
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:28,939
Jack, if anybody bothers you,
you just come and tell me, okay?

507
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,233
Okay.

508
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,906
Thanks for lunch.

509
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,243
All right.

510
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,537
- Phoebe and Jane.
- I told you.

511
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,790
- It's all your fault.
- Over here right now. Today!

512
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,670
- Come on. We're gonna
go see your teacher.
- She started it.

513
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,964
- Please.
- That was very rude, you know.

514
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:57,009
Let's kick their butts.

515
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:05,142
Hey, Louis, you "Iouiser."
To ten.

516
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:09,521
I'm not in the mood to get
my butt kicked today.

517
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,815
Well, we got the new kid.

518
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,275
What, are you crazy?

519
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,652
Wait. You can't pick him.
He can't play with us.

520
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,654
- Yeah.
- Hey, I can pick whoever I want.

521
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,823
- What? Are you afraid to lose?
- No.

522
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:23,493
Pick whoever you want.
We never lose.

523
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,205
Yeah, pick whoever you want.
We never lose.

524
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:30,792
Hey, you! Big guy.
You shoot hoops?

525
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:34,338
- Me?
- No, the 40-year-old kid behind you.

526
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,509
Yeah, you.
You play ball?

527
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:42,137
Yeah. With my dad.

528
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:46,099
- Are you fried?
- Hey, at least nobody's gonna slam him.

529
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:49,019
- All right, let's do it.
- Losers take out.

530
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,687
- So you take out.
- Yeah!

531
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:52,773
Yeah, you take out.

532
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:58,529
- Come on, just one chip.
- No!

533
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:02,282
- This is gonna be a good game, man.
- Let go, man. Gimme some room.

534
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,993
Wanna grab a burger
after school sometime?

535
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:08,830
Now, listen. All you gotta do
is just stand by the hoop, okay?

536
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:12,084
And I'll feed you the ball
like this.

537
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,921
- Let's do this.
- Kick their butts.
- Yeah, kick their butts.

538
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:20,717
Now, stand under the hoop.
Get your hands up.

539
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,222
Who let Godzilla out?

540
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,141
- And block him.
- I'll try.
- Let's do it.

541
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:34,273
Oh, boy.

542
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,235
Come on!
Get 'em, Jack!

543
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,071
Yes!

544
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,031
You said stand here.

545
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,202
- Just move your feet.
- Okay, move my feet.

546
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,247
- Pez?
- Sure, thanks.

547
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,416
Stand here and move my feet.
Move my feet.

548
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:55,752
Come on!
Come on!

549
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,463
- Jack, get him!
- Yeah!

550
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,966
- Hello, McFly.
- Hello.

551
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:04,720
- You gotta block him.
- Invincible!
- Yes!

552
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,433
Fake out.

553
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,687
Come on, Jack!
Block him!

554
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,441
- Yea!
- Yes!

555
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,943
- No!
- No!

556
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,237
Good work.

557
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:26,200
- Get him!
- You get him!
- That's right, Mario!

558
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:31,205
- Give us the ball.
- Losers take out.

559
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,167
Defence! Defence! Defence!

560
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,794
Defence! Defence!
Defence! Defence!

561
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,757
- Defence! Defence! Defence!
- Come on, John-John!

562
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,760
- Catch it! Catch it!
- Put it in the hole, Jack!

563
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,054
- Yeah!
- Like that's real fair.

564
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,516
We're kickin'
some major butt!

565
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,476
- That was good.
- Give me the ball.

566
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,478
Hey! What'd you stick at him?

567
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,980
Loser takes out!

568
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,941
Losers take out!

569
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,279
Give it to Mario!

570
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:08,325
- Mario!
- Shut up! Shut up!

571
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,209
- Loser!
- Next time.

572
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,880
Shoot it back.
Get it!

573
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,051
Get it!

574
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:33,684
- Victor!
- Bouncer.

575
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,280
Unstoppable!

576
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,372
Come on, man. Give it up.
Come on, Victor.

577
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:58,584
- Give it up!
- Get off me!

578
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,086
Get off of him! Man!

579
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,978
Everybody take out your notebooks.
We have a new assignment.

580
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:22,691
And it's something I want you to
put some serious thought into.

581
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,862
- I would like you all
to write an essay--
- Oh!
- Mm.

582
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,448
On what you would want to be
when you grow up.

583
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,867
Be sure to include reasons
for your choices...

584
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,455
and watch the spelling,
punctuation and grammar, please.

585
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,041
You'll have till the end
of the semester to finish it.

586
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,668
Write the date on the top
of the page. Don't forget.

587
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:45,422
- You too, George. The date.
- I want to be a gynaecologist.

588
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,591
If that's so, then I want
good reasons why.

589
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,885
You are the reason why,
Miss Marquez.

590
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,762
I want you to think about this.

591
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:55,098
It's going to be
a big part of your grade.

592
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,857
Maybe you ought to think about
using one of the choices
from the board. All right?

593
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:16,286
We're gonna have to change
your name from Jack to Shaq.

594
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,414
Nice shooting. Way to go.

595
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,583
Please, people. Don't leave this
till the last minute.

596
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,086
This the kind of assignment
I want you to spend some time on.

597
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,422
You have the whole semester to do it.
Just take your time.

598
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:31,593
Don't sit down and write it all
in the last weekend.

599
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,684
- Hey, guys.
- I got the new blueprints
for the new tree house.

600
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,603
- We made it.
- Hey, guys. It's finally Friday.

601
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,397
Who are we waitin' for?
What's her name?

602
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,648
- Mrs Durante.
- Mrs Durante.
- Yeah.

603
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,608
Problem is, we don't have
any "Playboys."

604
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,862
- Are you done with it?
- I hear George has a new girlfriend.

605
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,239
- Right over there.
- Hey, guys, I gotta go.
- Glasses.

606
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,449
- Tree house in an hour, all right?
- She's late.

607
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,326
- Yeah.
- We can't stay here all day.

608
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,829
- I think we'd better go back inside.
- We'll go back inside.

609
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,540
Hey. Great game today.

610
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,834
Thanks. Thanks for pickin' me.

611
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,919
Now you gotta do me
another favour.

612
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:09,047
- What kind of favour?
- Follow me.

613
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:15,804
Listen, my mother's coming here
to meet the principal today.

614
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,806
- She wants to talk to him.
- So?

615
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,768
- Well, you're gonna be the principal.
- Wh-What?

616
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:28,233
You gotta do it.
My mom talks to Principal McGee,
he'll tell her I've been bad.

617
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:32,905
- Well, have you been bad?
- Well, I haven't done homework
since, like, the third grade.

618
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,492
- W-- Your dog must be pretty full.
- Yeah, right.

619
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:40,329
Here she is.
You gotta do it. Here.

620
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:43,123
- Louie, I can't be a principal.
- Turn around.

621
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:45,542
- I can't do this.
- Turn around!

622
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:47,920
Principal McGee's really old!

623
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,339
- I can't do this.
- Louie!
- It's a fib.

624
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,508
Oh, hi, honey.

625
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:56,386
Oh, sweetie, The Beef and Brew
only gave me 10 minutes off.

626
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,889
So I gotta hustle.
Hi, sweetie.

627
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,641
- Hi.
- Hello.

628
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,685
- So, where's the principal?
- Um--

629
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,063
This is Principal Powell.
He's new here.

630
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,940
- Oh.
- He just came a couple of weeks ago.

631
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:12,319
- I told him you were coming.
- Oh, well, hello, Mr Powell.

632
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:15,364
My name is Delores,
but my friends call me D.D.

633
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,992
So tell me, what happened
to Principal McGee?
I just talked to him on the phone.

634
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:23,372
I don't know what happened
to Mr McGee. Mr Powell?

635
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:30,671
- He got diarrhoea.
- Diarrhoea?

636
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:33,590
Yeah, he got diarrhoea.

637
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,467
Uh, and he-- he spewed.

638
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,804
Threw up. Yeah, he had--
And, uh, he had the squirts.

639
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:41,723
- He had diarrhoea.
- Oh, boy, that's more
than I needed to know.

640
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:44,768
- He-He had to go to the hospital.
Appendicitis.
- Yeah.

641
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:49,565
- He had a bellyache.
- Oh, my God, appendicitis.
Oh, that's too bad.

642
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:53,110
Well, honey, listen. I swiped you
a chocolate mousse from the restaurant.

643
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:56,446
So go sit down and eat it
while I talk to the principal.

644
00:44:56,655 --> 00:45:01,243
- No, let me stay, Mom.
- Oh, sweetie, please don't
bust my chops over everything.

645
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:05,414
Go sit down. Oh, God, you see?
That's what I'm talking about.

646
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:10,210
He-- He doesn't listen. I mean, I don't
know whether it's all kids or just him.

647
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:12,379
- Am I right?
- What'd you say?

648
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,299
I said kids don't listen.
Am I right?

649
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:18,635
- Don't listen. No.
- Yeah. Well, that's what I thought.

650
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,972
Of course, you could say
the same thing about men too.

651
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:26,977
- Probably your wife does all the time.
- Oh, no.

652
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:29,479
- Aren't you married?
- Married?

653
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,899
- No, I'm not married.
- I'm divorced, myself.

654
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:35,319
And that's another thing, you know.
Ever since my husband left us...

655
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:37,821
he's got such
a chip on his shoulder.

656
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:40,324
Potato or corn?

657
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,368
Anyway, uh, you know.

658
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:46,288
He's-- He's starting
to get interested in girls.

659
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,457
I found some dirty magazines
under his bed.

660
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:52,336
Wh-What am I supposed to do about that?
What? l-l don't know what to do.

661
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,922
Uh, it's a tough age.

662
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,758
I know. I mean,
l-l-l-- I remember.

663
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:00,135
I mean, I re--
I'm remembering now.

664
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,097
- It's a tough age.
- Uch!
- Rough, tough age.

665
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:06,725
- Feh.
- Feh.

666
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,894
So, tell me, meanwhile,
how is he doin'?

667
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,813
'Cause last September
he was failing out miserably.

668
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:16,401
Oh, um, Louie's showing
a lot of improvement.

669
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:19,112
- He's on a roll, really.
- Really?

670
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:20,572
- Rolling.
- A roll?
- Really.

671
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,574
- Rolling along.
- Really, really rolling along.

672
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,868
- Wow.
- Wow.

673
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:28,497
And, uh, I would say,
uh, he's, uh...

674
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:31,416
the smartest kid
in the whole school.

675
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,670
Yeah. If not, maybe
the smartest kid I've ever met.

676
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:38,715
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I'm finally getting a good report.

677
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:41,218
It makes me so happy.

678
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:44,471
I mean, I can't believe
you're telling me this.

679
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:47,182
'Cause you know, this means
that maybe he's happy...

680
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:51,562
and I made the right decision
about moving us out here.

681
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,481
Listen, you know...

682
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:56,650
if you want to have
lunch or something...

683
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:02,072
we can talk about Louie and, you know,
just kind of shoot the breeze.

684
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:05,826
- What do you think?
- Don't.
- Oh.

685
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:07,911
- Got a problem?
- It's bad for you.

686
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,414
Since when is bein' bad...

687
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,708
bad?

688
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,793
Oh, no.

689
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,795
Oh, here she goes.

690
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:22,426
So, um, what do you think?
Do you wanna do lunch?

691
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,303
I get a discount
at the Beef and Brew.

692
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:28,056
Well, my mom brings my lunch usually.
I mean, she makes it.

693
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,059
Honey, you've got to cut
those apron strings.

694
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:33,145
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

695
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:37,524
Hi, angel. Well, Mr Powell's been
telling me what a good boy you've been.

696
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:41,904
-I told you.
-And I didn't believe you, but now I do.

697
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:45,574
And I'm gonna give Mr Powell
my number at work...

698
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:49,745
so that you can call me
and let me know how he's doing.

699
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:52,247
Can stay on top of things.

700
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:54,958
That's my number at work.
You can get me there anytime.

701
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,878
Well, my mom said
I shouldn't touch matches.

702
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:59,838
Oh, you live with your mother?

703
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,674
- Well, yeah, at night.
- Well, to each his own.
- Yeah.

704
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:06,428
Anyway, you can call me, uh,
to talk about Louis...

705
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:09,348
or, you know, any old thing.

706
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,436
So, uh-- Oh, and that's Memories.

707
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:16,647
That's a club that
I hang out at sometimes.

708
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,441
You know, if I'm not at work,
that's usually where I am.

709
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,694
But it's a nice place
for people our age to hang out...

710
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:27,783
have a little drink,
take the edge off, you know.

711
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,993
Oh, I gotta go.
Ooh, I'm gonna get fired.

712
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,371
- Love you, "face."
- Okay, love you too.
- Nice meeting you, Mr Powell.

713
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:36,750
Ooh, you got a strong grip.
You're a manly man.

714
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,878
All right, you got your key to
the house? Okay, I'll meet you at home.

715
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,798
- I love you.
- All right. Love you too.

716
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:46,051
Bye.

717
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:56,075

718
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:03,235
Wow! Whoa, that was great.

719
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,320
- How'd I do?
- You did great.
- Yeah?

720
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,322
- Yeah.
- Boy.

721
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,619
- Whew!
- Hey, man. I owe you one.

722
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:16,582
Sorry about my mom, Jack. She's lookin'
for love in all the wrong places.

723
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:19,918
Yeah, I know.

724
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,754
Maybe I'll see you
over the weekend.

725
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,715
Cool.

726
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:28,886
- Pal.
- Thanks.

727
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:56,538
Mom! I'm home!

728
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,086
I'm here. I'm here!
Where are you?

729
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,008
Yeah. Okay.

730
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:13,430
- Phone call for you, Brian.
- Yeah, just--
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah?

731
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:14,765
- Can I talk to him? Can I talk to him?
- Jackie wants to talk to you.

732
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,059
Dad! Hey, Dad. Dad.
I got your hair, Mom. Sorry.

733
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:21,438
Hey, Dad. Yeah. Hey, Dad.
I got to play basketball today.

734
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:24,149
They picked me. Yeah, and not
just 'cause I'm humongous.

735
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:27,069
Because I'm real good. Yeah,
I scored a thousand points.

736
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,279
No. You're right.
It was only a hundred.

737
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:31,865
I'm kidding. It was 14.
Yeah, but each time I got the--

738
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,410
I scored! Just like this.
Wait! Listen, Dad.

739
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:37,412
Yeah, and I met this
really cool kid named Louie.

740
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:40,415
Not Louis. Louie. Yeah.
His mom gave me some matches.

741
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,626
Yeah. Those are the matches.
Can I play with them?

742
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,294
Okay, slow down, buddy.
Slow down.

743
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:46,672
Hey, Dad.

744
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:48,757
Louie has dirty magazines
under his bed.

745
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,217
What are dirty magazines?

746
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,845
I got to be principal.
Yeah, I pretended to be.

747
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,222
And I got a lot of homework to do.
I got a great homework assignment.

748
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:58,141
And you know what? Miss Marquez
ate one of my red Gummi Bears.

749
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,644
She said, "Way to go." Yeah,
but not because of the red Gummi Bears.

750
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,104
Because of the way
I played basketball.

751
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:04,940
Yeah, it was great.
She said Shaq better watch his back.

752
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,317
She's what Grandpa says
is a real piece of work.

753
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:08,777
Really great.
What are you doing?

754
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:12,531
No, I'm just-- Just, uh,
shootin' an ad layout.

755
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,993
Carrots, for the Carrot Board.
Just giant carrots, yeah.

756
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:19,204
Wow, that's pretty boring.

757
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:20,455
Listen, Dad.
I gotta go.

758
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:22,958
No, I really gotta go.
Number one.

759
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:26,003
Okay. See you.
Yeah, listen, Dad?

760
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,088
Don't hug me any more
in front of the guys, okay?

761
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,048
Yeah, you know.
It's like-- You know.

762
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:32,467
It's weird. Yeah, okay.

763
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:35,679
See ya. Yeah, I'll take
the matches in the bathroom
so if I do number two, I'm ready.

764
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,390
Okay, put your mom on. Yeah.

765
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:42,561
Brian. Yeah, I can
hear you all right.

766
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,272
No, it's this cord. Oh, wait!

767
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:47,357
You okay?

768
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,737
- Honey!
- Is he okay?

769
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:54,865
Yes, he's all right.
He's so excited.

770
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,332
Hey, Jack's mother!

771
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,752
- Hey, Jack!
- Psych!
