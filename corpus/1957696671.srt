00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:09,752
<i>[Jersey Bounce - Bradshaw, Johnson, Plater]</i>

2
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,600
<i>Oh, excuse me.
- I'm sorry. -</i>

3
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,439
<i>Morning, Angie.
- Oh, hi Rose. -</i>

4
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,055
<i>I told my cousin Tina that you
were looking for a roommate,</i>

5
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,089
<i>but she already found a place.
- Oh, that's okay. -</i>

6
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,906
<i>Dan's arranging for me to get some
bedroom display furniture dirt cheap.</i>

7
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,931
With my employee discount,
I can just about afford it.

8
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:42,483
Mm-hmm! Things are getting pretty
serious between you and Dan McKinney.

9
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:43,936
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:47,676
If giving you inside information
on a sale isn't love, what is?

11
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,149
Oh, he's such a romantic.

12
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:50,854
Oh, speaking of romantic,

13
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,712
Jimmy's taking me to some
fancy new place for supper tonight.

14
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:55,870
"All You Can Eat for one price!"

15
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:56,950
Well, you should come with us!

16
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,917
Oh, I can't tonight, I'm sorry.

17
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,130
Rose, where do you
disappear to every Friday night?

18
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,903
You got a secret admirer, or what?

19
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:05,902
Yeah, Clark Gable,
only don't tell a soul.

20
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,707
Yeah, you can count on me.

21
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:08,981
What are friends for?

22
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,222
I'll tell you when you're late. Let's go!

23
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,919
...and, uh, no black.

24
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,130
Ahh, simple lines;

25
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,365
understated tones.

26
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,395
Excellent.

27
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,435
You've chosen well.
- Thank you. -

28
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,705
The area opposite the escalator
is an important showcase.

29
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,166
You’re quoting me.

30
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,209
Learn from the best, I always say.

31
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,078
Well, it's a good philosophy:
It seems to be working.

32
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:38,449
I understand you've been chosen salesgirl
of the month for the third month in a row.

33
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:39,672
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,073
<i>You've probably heard that
Miss Johnson is leaving us,</i>

35
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,555
which means that I'll
be looking for a trainee

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,924
for the position of Second Assistant Buyer.

37
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,980
I've chosen you, Rose.

38
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,638
Me?
- Mm-hmm. -

39
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,877
Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. -

40
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:54,672
Uh, tell the girls to, uh,

41
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,536
move that off the shoulder "tasette" number

42
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,358
before it becomes an antique.
- Uh, yes, ma'am. -

43
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,531
'Morning Miss Ryan, Miss White.
- Good morning, Mr. McKay. -

44
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,385
'Morning, Mr. McKay.

45
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:02,915
<i>Ready for the accessories</i> whenever you are.

46
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,809
<i>Uh,</i> half an hour, Mr. McKay.

47
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,497
I'll be waiting.
- Oh, Rose? -

48
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,646
Come by my office after lunch, <i>please.</i>

49
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:09,901
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,611
Psst!

51
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,033
Hey.

52
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,023
(I got one!)

53
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,217
(What?)

54
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,918
(I got a promotion.)

55
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:22,523
That's great!

56
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,585
Second Assistant Buyer Trainee.

57
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,016
Congratulations!

58
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,041
Thanks.

59
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,960
Walter and Maisie say, "It couldn't
have happened to a nicer person."

60
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:31,012
Thank you, Walter,

61
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,236
and Maisie.

62
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,647
Okay, I've narrowed it
down to these two necklaces.

63
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:37,208
Does Walter have a large budget?

64
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,071
Well,

65
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,679
that's a good question.

66
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,783
He's a working man,

67
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:46,808
like me.

68
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,154
But, when it comes to Maisie,

69
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,426
he would take the stars down from
the heavens and hand them to her.

70
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,356
I think this is the one.

71
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:00,806
Good choice.

72
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,597
Here you go.
- Oh, no, you do it. -

73
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:06,530
Walter wouldn't like me
being so familiar with his wife.

74
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,486
I don't blame you a bit.

75
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,289
Missed you at Arthur
Murray’s the other night.

76
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:12,331
We learned the Rumba.

77
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:13,945
Oh, swell!

78
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:18,629
What?

79
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:20,484
In your pocket?

80
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,089
Look what Walter's got!

81
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,164
To orchestra seats to Carousel, <i>tonight.</i>

82
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:28,826
Oh, you're crazy.

83
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:30,661
They just fell in my lap.

84
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,553
Buddy of mine broke up with his
girlfriend. He has no use for them.

85
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:34,645
'Pick you up at seven.

86
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,134
Oh, I'm sorry, I- I can't.

87
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,070
Another date?
- <i>No!</i> -

88
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:42,715
Rose, tickets like these
don't grow on trees.

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,243
I know, I just... I can't.

90
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,629
Maisie is done.

91
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:51,463
You're beautiful

92
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:52,488
...Maisie.

93
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,120
You're a lucky guy, Walter.

94
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:57,792
Enjoy the show.

95
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,792
We still on for tomorrow <i>night?</i>
- You bet! -

96
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,990
<i>Remember, guys and gals, next
Saturday night on Fantasy Ballroom.<i>

97
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:11,599
<i>Your host? Station WNOW, New York.</i>

98
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,330
"It started on Jersey Square,"

99
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,996
"And somebody heard it there."

100
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,497
"He put it right on the air,"

101
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:40,415
"And now you hear it everywhere."

102
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,205
"He put it right on the air,"

103
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,888
"And now you hear it everywhere."

104
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,321
Good Shabbos!

105
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,283
Ahh! Good Shabbos.
- Oi... -

106
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:51,045
Subway. I'm sorry, I'm so late.

107
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,876
Rayzel, what beautiful flowers.

108
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,563
- Glad you like them. -
Good Shabbos.

109
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:59,549
Shimon and your father will
be home from service soon.

110
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,230
- Mm-hmm. -
And

111
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:04,679
I made gugu.
- Ooh, my favorite! -

112
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,434
You can take some home.

113
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,816
And, they finally got

114
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,952
the little pairs I like

115
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:12,910
in the market, for me to dry.

116
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,724
Candied fruit like that, you'd never taste.

117
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,828
Even from down here, it smells wonder ful.

118
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:22,611
So,

119
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,190
did you find a new roommate yet?

120
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:28,115
No, but I got a deal on some
beautiful bedroom furniture

121
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,524
to replace what she took with her.

122
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:31,873
Good! I'll make you a nice bedspread.

123
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,309
And, I decided to give you

124
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,560
my soup pot!

125
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:37,672
It's a family heirloom.
- Thank you! -

126
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,181
Use it in good health.
You better light the candles.

127
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:43,186
You should've lit them
already: The sun's almost down.

128
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:45,611
Sza! You know I always wait for you.

129
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:48,516
Go on. We have a lot to talk about!

130
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,152
(Blessed are You, LORD
our God, King of the Universe,)

131
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,531
(Who sancified us with His
Commandments and instructed us)

132
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,557
<i>(to kindle the lights of the Shabbas.)</i>

133
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:11,247
Amen.

134
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,163
So, tell me,

135
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:16,125
what's new in the world of high fashion?

136
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,788
I have to start planning my fall wardrobe.

137
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:23,012
Tanta Perla, you've been wearing that
same dress ever since I can remember!

138
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,500
Ah, that's the secret of the elegant woman.

139
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,722
You have to find out
what <i>works, and stick to it.</i>

140
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:30,547
I'll keep that in mind in my new position.

141
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,427
Your "new position"?

142
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:33,948
I knew it.

143
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:35,203
So, tell me.

144
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:40,288
You're looking at the new
Second Assistant Buyer Trainee.

145
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:41,930
Mazeltov!

146
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,381
<i>Wonderful news.</i> Oh,

147
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,807
I knew, the day you drew
your first breast pennant,

148
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:52,607
that I would be reading about you in
that paper you always talk about.

149
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:54,389
The W-Whittle, uh...
- Women's Waydale -

150
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:56,457
That's the one, that one.
- And, I'm gonna sign up -

151
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:59,847
for evening classes at the New
York University School of <i>Retailing.</i>

152
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:04,011
Rayzel, what I told you
seventeen years ago,

153
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,906
when you stepped off that boat

154
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,969
is still true today!

155
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,293
America is <i>the land of opportunity!</i>

156
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,860
- Mm, please... -
<i>Ahh, imagine,</i>

157
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:15,736
"Chairman of the board, Miss Rose White"!

158
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,098
Shh, please!

159
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:21,023
Not so loud! Papa might come in.

160
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,645
So, let him.

161
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,403
He should be proud of you.

162
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:28,098
You are the first one in the family

163
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:30,451
that is a true American:

164
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,444
Educated; No accent;

165
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:36,197
A refined job. So, why
shouldn't you be Rose White?

166
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,459
Oh, Rayzel, I look at you,

167
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:42,270
and you know what I
see? I tell you what I see:

168
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,305
I see The Future!

169
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,362
<i>Good Shabbos!</i>

170
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:49,102
Good Shabbos, Uncle Shimon!

171
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,304
The cantor sang like an angel tonight.

172
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,844
I said to myself,

173
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:57,421
"Prayers like that go
straight to <i>God's ears."</i>

174
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,883
Shimon, where's Mordechai?

175
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,274
Here. I thought he was here.

176
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,552
If he was here, would I
ask you where he <i>was?</i>

177
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:07,591
He wasn't at services.
- That doesn't sound like Papa. -

178
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:10,333
Well, now we know where
he wasn't, and where he isn't.

179
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:12,998
He left the store early. You
were already up here cooking.

180
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
And?

181
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:17,201
It's like pulling teeth.

182
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:19,288
In our entire married life,

183
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,819
the man has never said more
than three sentences at a time.

184
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:26,744
<i>What's so important,</i> can't be
said in three sentences, hmm?

185
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,891
Why did Mordechai leave the store so early?

186
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,704
Oh,

187
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,654
It must've been the phone call.

188
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:39,225
- What phone call? -
The one he got around 2 o' clock.

189
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,558
- Who was it from, Uncle Shimon? -
I don't know,

190
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,694
but he hung up right away, and left.

191
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:45,736
I was busy with two customers.

192
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,364
I didn't get a chance to ask.
- <i>Hello?</i> -

193
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,766
You upstairs?

194
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,769
Where should we be?

195
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,904
I've got big news,

196
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,940
important news!

197
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,268
What's more important than services, hmm?

198
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:00,410
God will forgive me this one time.

199
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:01,572
Sit.

200
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,648
Everything's ready to put on the table.
- I said sit! -

201
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,351
What's all the excitement, Papa?

202
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,320
Glass of water first.

203
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,421
<i>Please.</i>
- I'll get the water. -

204
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,655
So?

205
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:21,338
Today,

206
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,034
at the store,

207
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,775
<i>came an urgent telephone call</i>

208
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,173
<i>from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.</i>

209
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:33,644
They want to speak to Mr. Mordechai Weiss,

210
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,679
of Brooklyn.

211
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:37,535
That's me.

212
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,484
Rayzel, what's taking <i>you so long?</i>

213
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:52,636
Alright, already!

214
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,199
I go down,

215
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,367
to the immigrant office,

216
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:58,809
and wait

217
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,099
with other people, who also wait.

218
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,521
Finally,

219
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,516
they call me in, and

220
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,745
give me these documents

221
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,728
from the Red Cross.

222
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:12,685
Rayzel,

223
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:15,819
thanks to God,

224
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,104
I found your sister.

225
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,129
Lusia?

226
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,080
Lusia's alive?

227
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:24,105
Yes.

228
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:27,064
<i>She went from concentration camp in Poland,</i>

229
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:29,258
<i>to hospital in Sweden.</i>

230
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,364
<i>she comes here by boat</i>

231
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:34,064
in around three more weeks.

232
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,840
<i>She's alive, thank God,</i>
- That's wonderful! -

233
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,065
<i>It's a miracle!</i>

234
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:41,598
<i>Rayzel?</i>

235
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:45,449
When Lusia comes, she will stay with <i>you.</i>

236
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:46,671
W-with me?

237
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:47,696
With you.

238
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,988
I want, you should get to know each other.

239
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,383
<i>That's right.</i>

240
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:55,001
You'll have your big sister.

241
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,595
home again, <i>darling.</i>

242
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,897
Well, it's very exciting,

243
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,619
But, I...

244
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,120
What? You what?

245
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,795
I don't even remember her.

246
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,670
When she comes, you will remember.

247
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,628
Well, she might feel awkward.

248
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:12,175
<i>Now</i> that I think of it,

249
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:15,845
Rayzel doesn't speak Yiddish very well.

250
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,922
Wouldn't it be better

251
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:19,929
<i>if Lusia came and stayed with us?</i>
- <i>No... She must learn good English,</i> -

252
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:21,634
<i>and Rayzel can teach her.</i>

253
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,309
She has that big, modern apartment

254
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,889
all to herself, now.

255
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,406
Papa, it's not so big.

256
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,648
Rayzel, your sister's staying with you.

257
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,762
You will take a vacation from work,

258
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,257
<i>and be with her every minute.</i>

259
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:35,727
I can't take a vacation; I
just got a promotion today!

260
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,507
Your sister's more important.

261
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,270
<i>They give you any
trouble over this at work,</i>

262
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,225
I'll go myself, and speak to them.

263
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,167
<i>Or you will quit, because</i>

264
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:46,497
if they don't see the point,
then they are no good anyway.

265
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,722
<i>Oh, Morde, calm down.</i>
- <i>Mordechai, there's no need for this.</i> -

266
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,230
What if she doesn't like me?

267
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:52,523
Doesn't like you?

268
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:54,117
"...doesn't like you?"!

269
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,573
She is your flesh and blood.

270
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,722
A blessing from God,

271
00:14:58,747 --> 00:14:59,947
on this family,

272
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:01,571
saved her life.

273
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,360
So, no more words from you.

274
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:05,742
Morde, give the child a chance.

275
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,292
She hasn't seen her since
she was four years old.

276
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:09,492
She was a baby!
- Perla... -

277
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:11,384
Perla, you keep out of this.

278
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,403
And, you keep Kosher.

279
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,273
Like you're supposed
to; like you was taught.

280
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,755
I want that your sister
should feel at home.

281
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:20,143
It's just that

282
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,979
I haven't seen her in a lifetime

283
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,849
W-We're strangers. It scares me.

284
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,219
I gave the immigrant office your number,

285
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:31,848
and they should call you
right away <i>when she arrives.</i>

286
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:34,244
Well, me? Shouldn't they call you?
- <i>Me, they should call.</i> -

287
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,286
Me, from the other side of the city.

288
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,675
<i>So, after traveling
halfway around the world,</i>

289
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,431
your poor sister can sit there,
and wait, for another five hours.

290
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,897
I'll get her, Papa.

291
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:47,922
<i>Of course.</i>

292
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:49,919
You will get Lusia,

293
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,978
and we will be a family <i>once more.</i>

294
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
<i>Perla,</i>

295
00:15:57,104 --> 00:16:01,318
<i>are we going, maybe, to wait till
sunrise tomorrow for Shabbos dinner?</i>

296
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,562
Mama...

297
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:49,721
Rose, you're coming with me, on Monday,
to Lombardi's, to look at the winter line.

298
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,759
Thank you. I-I'm looking forward to that.

299
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:53,857
You should be.

300
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:56,351
You should also be slightly terrified.

301
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,156
It's a very important day for you;

302
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,698
Your first step in becoming a buyer.

303
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,347
Be punctual! Wear white gloves.

304
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:04,372
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:05,837
I like the pearls.

306
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,264
That's it for me, kids.

307
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,686
My heart says, "Yes,"
my feet say, "No way."

308
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,749
Yeah, so do mine. She stepped all over 'em.
- Jimmy! I did not. -

309
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,431
If you ever decide to leave your
job, watch out Ginger Rodgers.

310
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,421
Oh, yeah, sure.

311
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,896
I can't believe I'm dancing with
the Second Assistant Buyer Trainee.

312
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,965
Yeah, turn around, and there's a promotion.

313
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,733
Turn around, there's Rose White.

314
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:12,583
Well, it's not quite as
thrilling as a promotion.

315
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,089
You know something? As I
grow older, I'm beginning to think

316
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:17,456
more and more that life is
just a series of accidents.

317
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,769
Some are bad,

318
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:20,945
some are good, but you
always have to be ready.

319
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,701
I don't think that way.

320
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,213
I think, um,

321
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:27,051
life is what you make it.

322
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,490
I love dancing with you.

323
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,491
It's like we're one person.

324
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:36,695
Yeah, but we're not.

325
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,563
We're two very different people.

326
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:43,260
We have a lot more in
common than you think.

327
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,269
Oh, yeah? Like what?

328
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,644
Well, we both work at Macy's, for one.

329
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:51,075
Thousands of people work at Macy's.

330
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,871
Oh, by the way, I won't
be at dance class this week.

331
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:56,574
Oh, yeah? Where are you going?
- Upstate. Family Reunion. -

332
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,595
They probably will be
waiting for me at the station.

333
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,953
They'll be so happy to see you!
- Mom will say I look too thin. -

334
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:04,142
My father, he'll have the
fishing gear all ready to go, so

335
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,090
the minute I unpack,
it'll be off to the lake.

336
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:08,426
Aw, that sounds like fun.

337
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:10,695
It's the strangest thing, you know?

338
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,353
You feel all grown up and mature,

339
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,865
given responsibility and important job,

340
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,587
but the minute you go home, what happens?

341
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:19,937
You look at your parents, and you're a
little kid again. You know what I mean?

342
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:21,087
Yeah.

343
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:25,109
Yeah, sure. Sure I do.

344
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,592
It'll be great to see my brother, though.

345
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:29,617
Boy!

346
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,549
I can remember when he was just a baby.

347
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,918
I should take him
fishing. Just the two of us.

348
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,126
He plays ball now.

349
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,356
God help me: Time goes by so fast!

350
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,092
He'll be dating a girl someday...

351
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,286
Hello?

352
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:59,151
Yes, this is she, but look: I was
just on my way out to work, and I, uh...

353
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,552
Pardon me?

354
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:02,873
My sister?

355
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,450
Oh, she's not supposed to
arrive for another two weeks.

356
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,088
Oh, I see. This morning.

357
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,137
Um...

358
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,367
Well, would it be possible for me to, uh,

359
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:18,383
pick her up sometime
this afternoon? I've got a v-

360
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:21,132
very important business
appointment that I really can't...

361
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,536
W-well, i-is there anywhere
else sh-she could wait?

362
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,575
No, I- I know she's had a long trip. I...

363
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:36,206
N-No, no! I-I'll be there. Um,

364
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,631
can you give me the address, please?

365
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,686
Uh, which pier?

366
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:44,011
Twenty-two... Thank you.

367
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,357
Yeah, I-I'll be there as soon as I can.

368
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Today?

369
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:52,330
Why today, of all days?

370
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,279
Hello, Miss Ryan?

371
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:24,636
Uh, this is Miss White calling.

372
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:25,661
Um,

373
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:28,763
I-I'm not feeling very well today.

374
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:00,494
'Scuse me,

375
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,504
I'm here... I was called. I'm
here to pick up, uh, Lusia Weiss.

376
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,532
"Weiss"?
- Weiss. -

377
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:06,677
Just a moment.

378
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:08,508
Excuse, please.

379
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,156
Yes?

380
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:13,540
You are, uh,

381
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:15,909
Rayzel Weiss?

382
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:16,934
Yes.

383
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:19,100
I am Lusia.

384
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:30,390
W-welcome to America!

385
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:31,845
Yes.

386
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,929
You sure you don't want
me to hold your bag?

387
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:50,844
It looks awfully heavy.
- Oh, no. I hold. -

388
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:53,447
Oh my goodness, it
feels like its 100 today.

389
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:57,051
We get summer days like this in New York,
but the fall is really quite pleasant.

390
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:58,218
Oh, it's this way.

391
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,132
Beautiful, even. When the leaves
fall off the trees, it's just so lovely.

392
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,891
Am I talking to fast? Are you
having trouble understanding me?

393
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,040
No, you speak fine.
- Okay. -

394
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:11,798
It's a lovely apartment, it's very
comfortable. I was awful lucky to find it.

395
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:14,000
You'll like it. I-I'm sure you will.

396
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,873
Come in, come in.

397
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:21,408
It's not very neat, but it's mine.

398
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,079
Uh, this is the dinette,

399
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:28,548
and, uh, the kitchen is in there,

400
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:31,158
and this is the living room, of course.

401
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:34,354
Have all this, for alone?

402
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,325
Well, I did have a roommate
for awhile. A girl from work.

403
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,079
But, uh, she got married,

404
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,400
and, um,

405
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,736
I've been trying to find someone. But,

406
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:45,879
I suppose I haven't really
been trying that hard.

407
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,581
<i>It's wonderful to have my privacy.</i>

408
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,311
It's not easy for you to

409
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,438
have me here so sudden.

410
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:54,649
We are like strangers, no?

411
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:55,976
<i>"Strangers"?</i>

412
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,944
What are you talking about?

413
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,700
I'm not a stranger, we're family.

414
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,215
I am sister.

415
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,140
Yeah, th-that's what I meant.

416
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:07,120
Oh, you have telephone.

417
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:10,857
<i>Oh, you should hear Papa go
on and on about that telephone.</i>

418
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,706
"You are a millionaire,
maybe? You need that for

419
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:15,049
your private chats with
John D. Rockefeller?"

420
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,445
He's so old-fashioned,
he just doesn't understand

421
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,926
what a modern young career woman requires.

422
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:23,937
Oh, I'm just going on and on, <i>and
you're probably, uh, hungry or-or thirsty.</i>

423
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:27,076
Um, would you like
some juice, or milk, or...

424
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:28,842
<i>A tea! Tea, in a glass.</i>

425
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:31,197
<i>Just like Papa, I-I
bet you like it like that.</i>

426
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:33,647
No, water is fine.

427
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:38,105
Please, Rayzel, not to trouble self.
- Oh, it's no trouble. -

428
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,619
It's no trouble at all!

429
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:42,856
All the appliances came with the apartment.

430
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,743
So, here's your water,

431
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:53,266
and, um... Would you
like some cheese, or some

432
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:57,244
fruit? I got grapes, and pear, and, uh...
- Mm! -

433
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,006
Pear! Thank you.
- Okay. -

434
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:04,252
Anything you see here, anything
you want, you just help yourself. Okay?

435
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:05,979
Because, uh, it's yours too.

436
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:09,783
Oh, no. This very nice
of you, but this yours.

437
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,384
Not mine, I... Maybe
someday, I have mine own.

438
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,242
But, this is yours.
- No. -

439
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,130
Here you go.

440
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:21,301
Why don't I phone Papa?

441
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,210
I-I'm sure that he'll be just so happy

442
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,413
to know that you made it here safely.
- <i>No.</i> -

443
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:26,994
<i>Uh, am tired.</i>

444
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,849
He has not seen me in many year.

445
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:32,379
One more day make no different.
- <i>Are you sure? I just got...</i> -

446
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,084
Tomorrow. <i>Call tomorrow.</i>

447
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:35,542
Tomorrow?

448
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,046
But you haven't seen
Papa for seventeen years.

449
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,813
You don't want to talk <i>to him now?</i>

450
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:40,893
Wait.

451
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,355
Okay.

452
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:50,663
It's fine.

453
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,795
Well, you probably want to rest, and

454
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,850
I-I'll uh,

455
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,631
I'll show you where you're
gonna be staying, okay?

456
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,537
This is the bedroom,

457
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:06,599
and it's a bran new bed.
Just a couple of days old.

458
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,275
<i>Oh, I cannot take your bed.</i>

459
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,699
Where will you sleep?

460
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:11,871
<i>Oh, I'm gonna sleep on
the sofa, in the living room.

461
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,985
No! I cannot let you do this.

462
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,850
No, it's fine. It turns into a bed.

463
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,072
<i>Still, it's not...</i>
- Eh, I insist. -

464
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:21,694
Alright, then

465
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:24,090
I accept your hospital.

466
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:28,348
"The hospitality." It's- It's <i>hospitality.</i>

467
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,440
Well, this English is not easy.

468
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:32,198
Oh, you speak very well.

469
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,393
How'd you learn?

470
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:36,409
I study with Mama to come to America.

471
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:39,000
<i>Every night, we read together,</i>

472
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,153
<i>back at home.</i>

473
00:27:40,383 --> 00:27:42,909
Oh, I see. Listen, I'll run you a bath.

474
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,224
Um, a bubble bath.

475
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:45,780
<i>It'll be like heaven, all warm</i>
- Please, no, Rayzel. Please... -

476
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:47,047
and sweet smelling, and- and-,
- <i>Rayzel, please.</i> -

477
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,456
and you can stay in there as
long as you want. A long time.

478
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,481
<i>'Scuse me</i>

479
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,367
<i>It's your size, it should fit.</i>

480
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:50,018
Please, come out.
- No. -

481
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:51,373
I'll be just over there,

482
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,041
if you need any help.
- Thank you. -

483
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,631
It's perfect!

484
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:59,395
It's lovely. You can
wear it out of the store.

485
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,750
No, no. It's too fine.

486
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:04,472
I see- I see other dress out there.

487
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:07,289
Good for work, plain, you know. And, I...

488
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,897
And you can buy

489
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:11,693
two of those for price of this

490
00:29:14,938 --> 00:29:16,475
You look nice.

491
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,301
When we fix your hair, you'll
look just like you were born here.

492
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:21,776
Was born in Poland, like you.

493
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,218
Yeah, I know.

494
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,487
I just think that you're-

495
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,136
you're here now, and

496
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,279
you should look like
you belong. That's all.

497
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:36,818
When seeing at home, in
here, I look like belonging more.

498
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:42,357
I pay back for dresses when I get job.

499
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:44,062
Fine, whatever you want.

500
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:49,631
I feel not good.

501
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:51,533
Oh, I knew we should've had a bite to eat.

502
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,935
No no, it's not that. It's in my

503
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,143
head.

504
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,167
I have not seen my father

505
00:29:57,192 --> 00:30:00,676
since I was nine years old little girl.

506
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:03,445
I am older now. What I say to him?

507
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:07,383
He's gonna be so happy to see
you! He's been waiting all this time.

508
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:08,750
Yes, I know, but

509
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:10,713
He see me like this sudden,

510
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:12,648
his heart, it, uh, it fail him.

511
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,870
He's not gonna have a heart attack.
He's a very strong man. Besides,

512
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:19,194
he knows you're coming, he just
thinks it's in a week or two. That's all.

513
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,195
Please, you go, and telephone to Papa.

514
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,168
That's ridiculous! We're
standing right near the place.

515
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:30,498
Besides, Papa doesn't take personal
calls during his business hours.

516
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:31,773
One of his rules.

517
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:34,676
One of his many little rules.
Now, come on. Let's go.

518
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:37,505
Papa, he is still pretty?

519
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:40,056
Handsome? Papa?

520
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:42,651
Yes. Handsome, tall,

521
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:45,387
and very struck.

522
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,761
Strict?

523
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:49,219
<i>He's still strict.</i>
- Strict. -

524
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,199
Rayzel!

525
00:30:57,642 --> 00:31:01,102
I remember we dress up good on Shabbos.

526
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,913
You, and mama,

527
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:05,640
all of us family, go out together.

528
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:10,024
I remember I see my
father's face, and I am to think,

529
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:11,313
"How happy,"

530
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:13,248
"how proud!"

531
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,586
He don't say nothing, but I see.

532
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:20,886
Do you know this face?

533
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,693
No, not really. I don't.

534
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:27,402
- Let's go. -
No, I-

535
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,258
I, uh, stay out here.
You make him prepared.

536
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:31,953
I wait.

537
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:34,678
Okay,

538
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:36,204
if that's what you want.

539
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:42,577
...and thank you. Thank you, k-

540
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:43,771
- Hello. -
Rayzel!

541
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:46,381
What is it? What's wrong?
- <i>Nothing.</i> No, nothing's wrong. -

542
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:49,151
<i>Why aren't you at work?
- It's Lusia. -

543
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
<i>She's here.</i>

544
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,300
She... Where?

545
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:53,862
She's outside, waiting.

546
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:54,887
Lusia?

547
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,033
<i>On the street?<i>

548
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,282
You left her on the street?

549
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,188
<i>She wanted me to come
in here, ant tell you first.</i>

550
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,330
She thought it might be
too much of a shock for you.

551
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:03,738
A shock?

552
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
Why?

553
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:07,669
Uh, she's a little
nervous about seeing you.

554
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:08,843
<i>Nervous?</i>

555
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,320
Did she say something?
- No. -

556
00:32:13,603 --> 00:32:14,963
<i>What did she say?</i>

557
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:17,279
<i>She- she said nothing. What do you mean?</i>

558
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:19,614
From her father, she should not be nervous.

559
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:34,293
My God, <i>thank God!</i>

560
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:38,202
Lusia?

561
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:41,192
Papa.
- It's a miracle. -

562
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:42,537
My God...

563
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,407
(My daughter?)

564
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:49,241
My Lusia.

565
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,959
[conversation in Yiddish]

566
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,013
You have changed also.

567
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:35,073
<i>You speak English.</i> That's good!

568
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,822
That's good.
- Mama taught her. -

569
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,650
Mama, Mama.

570
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,097
Do you know,

571
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:43,368
you look more like my sister, Berta.

572
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:44,896
<i>Do you know her?</i>

573
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,399
Yes, I- I knew her.

574
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:55,921
We'll close the store for a little while,
- Yes. -

575
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:59,411
and have a glass of wine to celebrate!

576
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:02,113
We never close the store
in the middle of the day.

577
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:04,129
And who'd be the manager
of this establishment?

578
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:06,345
If, uh, if you'll be so
kind as to read the sign,

579
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,787
it says "Greenspan's Haberdashery."

580
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:09,941
That's me,

581
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:13,131
a-and Perla of course,
and I say we close the store,

582
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:15,156
and have a drink to celebrate.

583
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:18,057
Alright, it's your money to throw away.

584
00:34:18,082 --> 00:34:19,298
Be my guest.

585
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:23,034
So,

586
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,479
look at all this.

587
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:32,511
I want, you should know
that this is a wonderful country,

588
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:36,214
but it takes a long time to
make a success of yourself.

589
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:37,677
You understand?

590
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,626
She understands, Papa.

591
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,893
It's important that she should know this.

592
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,419
No matter how much you suffer,

593
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:49,047
what you lose before,

594
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:53,028
no matter you don't hardly know no English,

595
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:56,294
<i>you can still be a person with respect,</i>

596
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,182
which is worth more
than all the tea in China.

597
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,635
You understand?

598
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:03,388
I understand.

599
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:05,944
<i>Music. Shimon,</i>

600
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,480
let's have music! Music, <i>now.</i>

601
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:10,276
Your sister, she got it all easy.

602
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:11,981
American all the way.

603
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,400
Nobody's gonna give her no trouble.

604
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:19,424
Well, I know it's not the same thing,
Papa, but I've had to work hard too.

605
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:23,328
<i>With God's help, you got brains and health,
so that's what you're supposed to do.</i>

606
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:27,379
<i>Hey, hey, this is a celebration,</i>
not a family argument.

607
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:29,530
Come on. Come on, let's dance.

608
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:30,849
Come on, sweetheart.

609
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:31,970
Come on.

610
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:56,577
I dreamed, one day, I would
dance with my wife again.

611
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,358
That will have to stay a dream.

612
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:01,094
Lusia,

613
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:03,562
you dance with me?

614
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,158
No, I am not Mama. Mama is dead!

615
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,421
<i>Lusia,</i>

616
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:19,331
Lusia,

617
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:23,628
your papa,

618
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,958
it is not his fault.

619
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:30,375
He did all he could to
get you, and Mama, out.

620
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,565
<i>We all did.</i>
- Perla, you don't need to speak for me. -

621
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:36,014
Lusia knows what is the truth.

622
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,504
Oh yes, Papa, I know
very well what is truth.

623
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:42,560
What are you talking
about? I- I don't understand.

624
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:44,009
<i>Nothing,</i> nothing.

625
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:47,879
Now, please, this is a
good time. A happy time.

626
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:50,675
Let's drink. <i>Let's be happy.</i>
- What are you saying? -

627
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,357
- What's happening? -
<i>Nothing, sweet.</i>

628
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:55,642
<i>Nothing, darling.</i> Nothing, nothing!
- Let's drink! Let's drink. -

629
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:58,062
<i>We were going to drink a toast.</i>

630
00:36:58,087 --> 00:36:59,424
<i>We will have a toast.</i>

631
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:01,605
<i>To our family!</i>

632
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:04,463
- <i>To our family!</i> -
- <i>To our family.</i> -

633
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,893
To our family.

634
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:41,408
It's okay, it's okay.

635
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,730
You were just dreaming.

636
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:44,972
It's okay. Shh.

637
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:49,363
Okay...

638
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:52,156
I, uh,

639
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:55,509
I am sorry to disturb your sleep.

640
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:59,847
<i>Please, go sleep some more.</i>
- No, no. It's alright, it's alright. -

641
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,450
What were you dreaming about?

642
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:04,948
All fire.

643
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:07,642
Everywhere, fire.

644
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:10,691
<i>The whole world burn.</i>

645
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:22,870
Have you ever wondered about
why you got sick, and <i>not me?</i>

646
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,588
<i>Why I came to America,
and you stayed behind?</i>

647
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,546
Mama said, was plan from God.

648
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:34,181
God?

649
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,652
But she keep

650
00:38:38,677 --> 00:38:42,223
boat tickets, even
though they no more good.

651
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,495
Tell me about Mama.

652
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,330
You don't remember her?

653
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:51,632
<i>Why this?</i>

654
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,249
You were not baby when
you and Papa go away.

655
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:57,464
<i>I know, but I was very young,</i> and

656
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,515
Papa, and Tanta Perla,
they- they never used

657
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,477
Mama's name, or yours.

658
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:05,452
They called you "them".

659
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:08,249
<i>They spoke in whispers about you,</i>

660
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:11,452
and I could only pick up a little
bit of- of what was going on.

661
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,754
What about letters?

662
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,791
Mama write, always.

663
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:19,593
Tanta Perla used to
translate them for me, but

664
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,664
After awhile, they just stopped coming, and

665
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,433
I began to forget, completely.

666
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:30,004
By the time the war came,
it was as if no-one had

667
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,267
been there at all.

668
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:40,356
Well,

669
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,390
Mama, sh-she was

670
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,286
very beautiful.

671
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:51,154
She had skin like soft, shiny cloth that...

672
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:53,954
- Silk? -
Yes.

673
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:56,297
Like silk.

674
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:59,528
She makes me to laugh.

675
00:39:59,553 --> 00:40:01,168
She likes jokes.

676
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,706
Her head is always in dreams.

677
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,443
"No matter things how bad,"

678
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,046
"going soon to be better.

679
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,615
<i>Mama pray for that.</i>

680
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:16,417
Even after?

681
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:18,692
Always.

682
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:23,457
That was Mama.

683
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:26,066
There's something else I've

684
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,032
been wanting to ask you.

685
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,799
Lusia. You never call me by my name.

686
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:32,824
"Lusia".

687
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:36,036
I guess I just haven't
said it in so long, since-

688
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:38,618
since we were little,
since we were all together.

689
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:39,907
You say now?

690
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:44,573
Lusia?

691
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,349
Mama, did she...

692
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,884
Did she speak often about me?

693
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,157
No....

694
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,208
No.

695
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,895
<i>Oh, I was just wondering, 'cause-</i>

696
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,330
because...

697
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:05,826
It doesn't matter. I think we
should get some rest, huh?

698
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,214
Mm-hmm.

699
00:41:09,112 --> 00:41:11,505
Yeah, goodnight.
- <i>Goodnight.</i> -

700
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:14,211
'Night.

701
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:29,873
...tell them I want an
appointment next week, at

702
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,090
8:30, Monday.
- Good morning, Miss Ryan. -

703
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,625
Oh, Rose. Come into my office.

704
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,073
8:30, now!

705
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:39,163
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

706
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:42,853
I wanted to let you know
how sorry I am, that I

707
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:45,336
let you down by
canceling at the last minute.

708
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:48,245
I can explain my absence.

709
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,275
I thought you already
had. It was the flu, wasn't it?

710
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:56,349
Uh, no, ma'am, it wasn't the flu. I-

711
00:41:56,374 --> 00:41:58,016
I...
- Oh, don't bother, Rose. -

712
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,551
I saw you coming out of
B. Altman's with a friend.

713
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,888
<i>Why did you find it necessary to lie to me?</i>

714
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:06,824
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,976
I'm so sorry I disappointed you, Miss
Ryan. I want so much to do a good job.

716
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:14,324
It's just <i>that, this last week...</i>

717
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:15,349
Rose,

718
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:18,269
I see good potential in you.

719
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,297
<i>I'm willing to forget this episode,</i>

720
00:42:20,322 --> 00:42:23,128
<i>but this is your one, and only,
chance. Do you understand?</i>

721
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,153
Yes, ma'am.

722
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:26,017
Good.

723
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,207
I have to go to Lombardi's again next week.

724
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:30,948
I'm counting on you to accompany me.
- Thank you. -

725
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:33,350
You're welcome. And,
if you must take time off,

726
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:36,020
don't waste it shopping at B. Altman's.

727
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,141
Yes, ma'am.

728
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:43,961
Rose, have you heard all of what I've said?

729
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:46,263
Sure. What did he say?

730
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,898
Oh, not much.

731
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,267
He was definitely non-committal.

732
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,000
All I've ever wanted
was a home, and a family.

733
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:56,747
I'm counting the hours 'till I
can waltz out of this place.

734
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:59,410
Now, someone like you,
it's different altogether.

735
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,879
You are going to be a career woman,

736
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:04,986
like Rosalind Russel in all those movies.
- There you are! -

737
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:08,052
Oh, hi!
- Wow, look whose back. -

738
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:10,554
Hi, Angie.
- Mr. McKay. -

739
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,587
On the other hand,

740
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:16,894
Rosalind Russel always
ends up with Cary Grant.

741
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:20,761
What was that all about?

742
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:23,881
Nothing. We were just
talking about movies, that's all.

743
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,209
<i>How was your visit?</i>
- It was great. -

744
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,504
<i>But, I missed you.

745
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:30,374
I- I missed you too.
- Brought you a present. -

746
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:33,644
Thank you.

747
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:42,774
<i>It's an old family tradition.</i>
My grandmother makes them.

748
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,922
It's lovely. Thank you.

749
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:47,805
I got a couple things to do upstairs
yet. We <i>still on for tomorrow night?

750
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,266
Yeah, yeah.
- I'll see you then. -

751
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,028
<i>Okay, see you then.</i>

752
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:58,135
<i>Lusia, I'm home!</i>

753
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:02,173
I called you at lunch time,
but you must've been in the tub.

754
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:05,576
We should probably get
going, or we're gonna be late.

755
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:07,786
Lusia?

756
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:09,126
Lusia?

757
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:13,443
Lusia?

758
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:24,234
Lusia?

759
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:46,663
Lusia!

760
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:50,600
Where were you? I thought
something happened to you.

761
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,590
No, I, uh, went to place.

762
00:44:52,615 --> 00:44:54,815
I come to first where you get me.

763
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,634
All by yourself? Why?

764
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,548
Um, they have

765
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:04,001
list there. I go to
read lists in their books.

766
00:45:05,117 --> 00:45:08,810
They have every day new names
of people they find from the camps.

767
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:10,855
<i>Some coming just now</i>

768
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,412
<i>from</i> the woods where they been hiding.

769
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:19,892
But why?

770
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:22,086
What are you looking for?

771
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:31,276
Well, I look to see if there is

772
00:45:32,412 --> 00:45:34,874
somebody that I know,

773
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,302
from home village,

774
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:37,634
that is alive.

775
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:39,456
And?

776
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:43,807
I see no names I know.

777
00:45:46,892 --> 00:45:48,012
I'm sorry.

778
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:00,044
We should probably go.

779
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:01,925
It's a long ride to Papa's.

780
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:05,089
Lusia, are you almost ready?
- Mm-hmm, almost. -

781
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,752
I'll fix your hair.

782
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,526
No, my hair is good.

783
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:12,503
Oh, I'll style it a little bit
softer. It'll suit your face.

784
00:46:12,528 --> 00:46:14,834
You'll look like a totally new person.
- No! -

785
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:20,077
Wh-why it is so important for
you to look different from yourself?

786
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,227
We should probably
go. We're gonna be late.

787
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:26,554
Here you go.

788
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:35,088
They're here, they're here.

789
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:38,858
Finally, we're here.

790
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:41,500
Lusia,
- Good Shabbos. -

791
00:46:41,525 --> 00:46:43,056
good Shabbos!
- Good Shabbos. -

792
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:45,626
Ooh, my, you look so good.

793
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:48,921
- Doesn't she look nice? -
What a pretty dress.

794
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:51,204
Rayzel make me pleasant.

795
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,167
And, you're getting a little color.

796
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:57,844
My papa, rest his soul, always used to say,

797
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,048
[speaking in Yiddish]

798
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:05,953
It, uh, makes the cheeks red.

799
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:09,522
And wait till you taste my challah.

800
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:11,457
My grandmother taught me the trick.

801
00:47:11,482 --> 00:47:13,535
You dip a feather in egg yolk,

802
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,529
and spread it over the
loaves till they shine.

803
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,959
I do the same.

804
00:47:17,984 --> 00:47:19,105
Mama, also.

805
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,535
Oh, the men will be home from service soon.

806
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,237
We better light the candles.

807
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,848
Lusia,

808
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:33,497
I did not think we would
see you again in this lifetime.

809
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:36,816
Please, you light the candles, darling.

810
00:47:40,501 --> 00:47:41,501
Thank you.

811
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,863
(Blessed are You, Lord our God,)

812
00:48:03,888 --> 00:48:06,011
(King of the Universe,)

813
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,727
(Who has sanctified us)

814
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:11,051
<i>(with His Commandments, and
has Instructed us to light the candles)</i>

815
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:12,899
<i>(of the Shabbath.)</i>

816
00:48:13,794 --> 00:48:14,869
Amen.

817
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:16,669
Amen.

818
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,288
<i>Look at them, Perla.</i>

819
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:25,698
<i>They take after different
sides of the family.</i>

820
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:27,264
<i>Lusia,</i>

821
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:31,771
it's incredible how much
you look like my sister, Berta.

822
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:37,443
Ghosts, Papa. You always speak of ghosts.
- "Ghosts, ghosts..." -

823
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:42,849
For your information, daughter, we
honor the dead by speaking of them.

824
00:48:42,874 --> 00:48:46,040
<i>It's enough, already!</i> Can't you
talk about something cheerful?

825
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:48,968
<i>"Cheerful." You all are going
to be happy, happy happy...</i>

826
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:50,353
It wouldn't hurt.

827
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:51,751
<i>Well,</i>

828
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:57,029
then, I think Lusia should be happy
that she's lucky enough to be sitting here.

829
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,434
Lucky?

830
00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:01,434
Talk! This is lucky?

831
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,445
That's not what I meant,

832
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,432
and you know that.
- <i>If you enjoy speaking of the dead,</i> -

833
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,808
Papa, I'll tell you about them.

834
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:11,511
I keep list of family.
- Lusia! -

835
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:13,565
<i>Now, Lusia,</i> have some tea, here?
- <i>No, no, no.</i> -

836
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,303
Berta Weiss, murdered,

837
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,653
Auschwitz,

838
00:49:17,678 --> 00:49:21,187
sister of Perla and Mordechai <i>Weiss.</i>
- We don't need the list. -

839
00:49:21,276 --> 00:49:23,869
<i>Marchus Weiss, murdered,</i>

840
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,727
Bergen-Belsen, brother of Mordechai Weiss.

841
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:31,998
<i>Zauman and Esther Weiss, and son,</i>

842
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:33,432
<i>Ignatius,</i>

843
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:36,903
<i>and</i> grandchildren, Reyna and Miriam,

844
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:39,158
<i>murdered, Treblinka,</i>

845
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:41,807
<i>cousins of Mordechai Weiss.</i>

846
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:46,712
Luba Eissmann Weiss,
- <i>Lusia...</i> -

847
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:52,869
murdered, Dachau,

848
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:57,303
wife of Mordechai Weiss,
- Lusia... -

849
00:49:57,673 --> 00:50:00,526
mother of Lusia and Rayzel Weiss.

850
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:03,155
<i>Lusia, please, that's enough.

851
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,064
One name more, Papa.

852
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:06,766
Not on list,

853
00:50:07,822 --> 00:50:10,136
but in my heart.

854
00:50:11,406 --> 00:50:13,506
David Pechenik,

855
00:50:14,504 --> 00:50:18,544
missing, arrested, Czerniejewo, Poland,

856
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:21,981
<i>son-in-law of Mordechai Weiss,</i>

857
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:25,532
husband to Lusia Weiss.

858
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:56,282
It was such a beautiful
day, children playing.

859
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:58,958
Then, twelve days after the wedding,

860
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:00,714
they took David away.

861
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,888
And you haven't seen him since?

862
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:06,859
No. I wait for him here, in America.

863
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:09,762
But, after all these years...

864
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,531
I know he is alive.

865
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:13,896
How do you know?

866
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:17,470
Oh, I can feel it, here.

867
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:22,758
<i>Mama!</i>

868
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:26,412
Mama, no!

869
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:27,553
<i>Mama!</i>

870
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,037
Oh!
- Mm-hmm, yes, I fix supper. -

871
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:58,653
Special? You didn't have to do that.
- No, -

872
00:51:58,678 --> 00:52:01,869
is for to celebrate. Tanta
Perla give me job at bakery.

873
00:52:01,894 --> 00:52:04,307
You're kidding!
- I go early, -

874
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:06,448
when still dark outside,

875
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:09,517
help bake bread, and make nice things,

876
00:52:09,967 --> 00:52:14,789
then come home at noon time. Good job.
- No, it's a very good job! -

877
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:19,054
Hello?

878
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,189
<i>Rayzel?</i>
- Papa? What's wrong? -

879
00:52:21,214 --> 00:52:22,490
Nothing is wrong.

880
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,632
Can't a man telephone his own daughter?

881
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:27,950
Well, of course, but it's just you've
never called here before. That's all.

882
00:52:27,975 --> 00:52:29,571
Well, there's always a first time.

883
00:52:29,962 --> 00:52:32,540
I called to tell you
that you should prepare

884
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:35,277
some decent kosher food tomorrow night.

885
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:37,647
<i>I'm coming over with something special.</i>

886
00:52:37,672 --> 00:52:39,355
Wha-what is it?

887
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,162
<i>You'll find out tomorrow.</i>

888
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:46,983
What he want?

889
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:48,923
Coming over for dinner, tomorrow night.

890
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:51,493
Why? Here?
- Yeah. -

891
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,347
He's never been here before.

892
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,183
<i>Look at this one, Kate.</i>

893
00:52:57,826 --> 00:52:59,726
<i>It's gonna walk off the racks!</i>

894
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:02,837
We're doing it in high
shades of black. Very elegant,

895
00:53:02,862 --> 00:53:04,729
and a price you cannot beat.

896
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:09,677
I don't like this heavyweight
gabardine, Henry. It's too bulky.

897
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,513
"Heavy"?

898
00:53:13,184 --> 00:53:14,449
"Bulky"?

899
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:17,250
I have a guaranteed <i>supply.</i>

900
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,781
The same can't be said
for the store's customers.

901
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:22,671
We sell 'em too many of those,
they'll go straight <i>to the competition.</i>

902
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:26,088
<i>Now, it's getting late.
I will take in the suits:</i>

903
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:30,726
<i>24,</i> not 25 or 26, 27
with modifications... Oh,

904
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,567
<i>and no. 19.</i>

905
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,570
You're not ordering 34?

906
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:40,441
It's a designer knockoff, Kate. You'll see
it on all the magazine <i>covers next month.</i>

907
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:42,617
Rose?

908
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:44,946
What do you think?
- Me? -

909
00:53:46,305 --> 00:53:47,305
Well,

910
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:50,821
I- I think that those
shoulder pads are too military.

911
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:54,856
The war is over, and women don't
wanna look like soldiers any more.

912
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:58,586
You heard her, <i>Henry.</i>

913
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:01,702
<i>Do 'em without the shoulders,
and I'll take five hundred.</i>

914
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,119
Alright, girls, let's go.

915
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:05,533
I'll have a word with
Saul, see what he says.

916
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,736
By the way,

917
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:10,519
I have

918
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:14,542
volunteered to, uh, organize
the Labor Day picnic this year.

919
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,945
How many tickets would you like?
- One, please. -

920
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:17,994
One?

921
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:20,517
Angie Sergente's ordered eleven.

922
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:23,952
It's a family affair.
- Oh, no, I'll be going by myself. -

923
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:28,122
What about your sister?

924
00:54:29,942 --> 00:54:33,308
H-how did you know about my sister?
- "How did I know?" -

925
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:37,118
I called your apartment,
this morning, to tell you that

926
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:40,462
the Lombardi <i>appointment had
been changed to 9:30, and, uh,

927
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:42,537
<i>at first I thought I had the
wrong number. But then,</i>

928
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:45,436
<i>the young lady with the accent
said that you had already left</i> for work,

929
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:46,975
and that she was your sister.

930
00:54:52,524 --> 00:54:56,026
She's the one I saw you at
B. Altman's with, wasn't she?

931
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:57,685
Yes, ma'am.

932
00:55:01,538 --> 00:55:02,538
So,

933
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:05,773
shall I put you down for two?
I'm sure she'd enjoy the picnic.

934
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:07,428
Oh, I don't think she'd like to come

935
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:11,290
Well, then how about the whole family?

936
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:12,315
No.

937
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,869
No, that's not a <i>good idea.</i>

938
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,326
For you, or for them?

939
00:55:19,535 --> 00:55:21,175
I- I don't know what you mean.

940
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:25,279
Saul says okay on the shoulders,
but only because it's you.

941
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:29,430
The labor costs alone are gonna reduce
our profit margin to a big, fat zero.

942
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:32,500
Oh, don't look to me for sympathy,
Henry. I've known you for too long.

943
00:55:32,525 --> 00:55:34,295
I want you to write up
that order for the standard

944
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,757
fifty percent of <i>key sale.</i>
- Fifty percent? -

945
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:38,727
<i>Oh, drop the peplums on that no. 27 jacket.</i>

946
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,863
I don't like it. It's too fussy for
the woman in the office today.

947
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,786
Now, where do you keep
that sludge you call coffee?

948
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,234
Over there.

949
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,597
It's been a pleasure doing
business with you, Kate,

950
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:50,171
as always.
- Thank you, thank you. -

951
00:55:50,196 --> 00:55:52,580
And, thank you, Rose.
- Thank you. -

952
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:59,695
You know, Rose, I was born in Dublin.

953
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,839
You were?
- And, when we came here, -

954
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:05,826
my father had to sweep streets,
and my mother took in laundry.

955
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:09,524
My brother and I were given everything
in the world that they didn't have.

956
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:14,829
So, when it came time for
my grade school graduation,

957
00:56:15,527 --> 00:56:19,133
I didn't want those funny people there,
embarrassing me in front of my friends.

958
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:23,131
So, I told them that the ceremony
was only open to the students.

959
00:56:23,156 --> 00:56:25,273
"The gym was <i>so small," and</i>

960
00:56:26,343 --> 00:56:29,243
to this day, I'm ashamed
of that hurtful lie.

961
00:56:30,794 --> 00:56:32,947
Oh, it's not like that for me, Miss Ryan.

962
00:56:33,154 --> 00:56:34,154
<i>Really.</i>

963
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:36,584
<i>I-I'll just be needing the one ticket.

964
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:39,723
Okay.

965
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,205
"One ticket for Miss Rose White."
- Thank you. -

966
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,303
<i>When you were little, you used to love</i>

967
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:52,896
<i>for me to make faces</i> from potatoes.

968
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:54,579
Really?

969
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:00,448
There is,

970
00:57:00,473 --> 00:57:01,473
Rayzel,

971
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,006
one time,

972
00:57:03,638 --> 00:57:08,445
You hold potato like this,
and I try to make, um, eyes,

973
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:10,481
for the face.

974
00:57:11,276 --> 00:57:14,512
And, the knife slipped and cut your hand.

975
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:18,355
<i>I did it by accidental thing.</i>

976
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,399
<i>And, um,</i>

977
00:57:19,614 --> 00:57:22,359
you cry and cry and cry, blood everywhere.

978
00:57:22,384 --> 00:57:24,154
And Papa, he get so mad.

979
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,482
But Mama, she come

980
00:57:25,507 --> 00:57:28,365
right to you, and hold you, and
she kiss your hand. And she say

981
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,290
when you are big girl, and
you marry a soldier, that th-

982
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:33,279
the cut will be all...

983
00:57:34,213 --> 00:57:35,973
"Healed."
- Uh, healed. -

984
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:39,536
Is it true, what Mama said? Let me see.

985
00:57:39,772 --> 00:57:42,239
Let me see, let me see here...
- I don't know. -

986
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,281
I did on here. Here.

987
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:47,050
<i>Tiny little scar.</i>

988
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,515
Papa said I got that in a
schoolyard, in Brooklyn.

989
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,757
Oh, Papa say wrong.

990
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:00,871
Why did he take away the memory?

991
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:05,702
You made a good meal, Rayzel!

992
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:08,745
This fish was a little bit <i>salty,</i>

993
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,047
<i>but the eggs was good!</i>

994
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,409
Thank you, Papa.

995
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,278
I'm proud to have you here.

996
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:22,855
This is for you,

997
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:24,327
Lusia.

998
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:28,859
For you and your husband, when he is found,

999
00:58:29,185 --> 00:58:30,460
God willing.

1000
00:58:35,227 --> 00:58:36,227
Open it.

1001
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:37,354
Open it!

1002
00:58:41,472 --> 00:58:45,542
So you can have a good
start <i>in the new country.</i>

1003
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:47,657
Where did all that money come from?

1004
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:50,914
<i>From the day we arrived</i>
here, I saved it. Every week.

1005
00:58:51,455 --> 00:58:54,218
Was to bring Lusia, and
<i>her mother, to America.</i>

1006
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,087
By the time there was enough,

1007
00:58:57,457 --> 00:58:59,356
the Nazis came, and

1008
00:58:59,845 --> 00:59:02,693
it was too late. But, all these years,

1009
00:59:03,194 --> 00:59:04,394
I've kept it.

1010
00:59:08,627 --> 00:59:10,147
Take it back, Papa.

1011
00:59:11,636 --> 00:59:12,916
I don't want it.

1012
00:59:14,011 --> 00:59:15,138
Why?

1013
00:59:17,195 --> 00:59:18,195
Tell her.

1014
00:59:19,112 --> 00:59:20,978
Tell her why. Tell her

1015
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:22,424
what happened.

1016
00:59:23,802 --> 00:59:24,842
I don't know.

1017
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,712
Nothing happened.
- Exactly! -

1018
00:59:27,737 --> 00:59:28,812
Nothing.

1019
00:59:30,272 --> 00:59:32,549
Mama is waiting, and waiting.

1020
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:35,459
She has such faith, such patience.

1021
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:38,408
Then, letter comes from
Tanta Perla. She wants to know

1022
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:40,237
why Papa won't take the money.

1023
00:59:40,262 --> 00:59:42,633
But, that letter has nothing to do...

1024
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,828
What money?
- <i>The money some immigrant group</i> -

1025
00:59:44,853 --> 00:59:47,397
<i>is going to give him,</i> so we should come.

1026
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:48,906
But Papa say no.

1027
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:51,288
He won't take from no-one.
- <i>But,</i> -

1028
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:54,653
this you should understand,
to owe nothing to nobody!

1029
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:56,428
Oh, Papa...

1030
00:59:56,453 --> 00:59:59,016
<i>A man's dignity, that's all he has.</i>

1031
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:00,898
You should've taken the money.

1032
01:00:00,914 --> 01:00:03,754
"Should have, should have.
Should have!" Easy say.

1033
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:06,744
The moment you owe something to somebody,

1034
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,773
you lose a part of yourself.
- <i>Look at how Mama and Lusia suffered</i> -

1035
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:11,722
because you were to
proud to take the money!

1036
01:00:11,747 --> 01:00:14,311
They offered the money before the troubles!

1037
01:00:15,356 --> 01:00:18,709
How could I know what was going to
happen? How could I know about Hitler?

1038
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,305
<i>I had a crystal ball, showing Hitler?</i>

1039
01:00:22,608 --> 01:00:25,008
Every penny I made, I saved

1040
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,161
so I could bring them to America.

1041
01:00:27,186 --> 01:00:30,380
I just took enough for
food, and clothes for Rayzel.

1042
01:00:30,405 --> 01:00:33,404
I wore the same suit for
seven years. For seven years!

1043
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:37,821
Well, each day, we were waiting for
you, Papa. But you never send for us!

1044
01:00:38,024 --> 01:00:40,550
<i>You don't think I suffered too?</i>
- "Suffered"?! -

1045
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,911
<i>Yes,</i> I suffered!

1046
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:43,527
Nobody thinks about that.

1047
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:47,183
I did not want to come to
America with just Rayzel,

1048
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,565
but you got sick.

1049
01:00:48,643 --> 01:00:49,699
<i>Remember?</i>

1050
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:52,669
Don't you sh...
- <i>Remember? You got sick,</i> -

1051
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:55,672
and we lose all four
tickets if we don't go.

1052
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:57,407
And, Mama and I discussed it.

1053
01:00:57,432 --> 01:00:59,443
We discussed it, and we agreed

1054
01:00:59,646 --> 01:01:02,372
that you should stay with
Mama, and I go first, with Rayzel.

1055
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:04,414
<i>We agreed on that, Mama and I.</i>

1056
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:06,340
<i>We agreed on that!</i>

1057
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:08,525
So, I take Rayzel,

1058
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,687
and plan to send for you

1059
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:12,556
and Mama later.

1060
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:14,384
And there I was,

1061
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,660
all alone in this big city. Me.

1062
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:19,322
To derogate my life, I
even heated a cup of water.

1063
01:01:19,486 --> 01:01:21,785
Oh, you compare that with
what Mama had to suffer?

1064
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:24,060
<i>No, I don't compare that with Mama!</i>

1065
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:26,676
I was a man when I came to America.

1066
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,126
A strong, healthy man.
I had feelings, desires.

1067
01:01:30,956 --> 01:01:32,256
And every night,

1068
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:33,744
night after night,

1069
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:37,914
month after month, year after
year, I sleep in an empty bed.

1070
01:01:39,554 --> 01:01:43,887
And, slowly, everything inside me dies,

1071
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:46,056
till I'm not a man anymore.

1072
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,714
<i>You never ask</i> what happen to your wife.

1073
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:53,626
You never once ask what happen to Mama.

1074
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:56,176
She's dead. That's all I
need to know. She died.

1075
01:01:56,201 --> 01:01:59,538
She did not die, she was
murdered! Butchered, because

1076
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:02,027
you abandoned her!
- That's not true. -

1077
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,107
Papa, she could've lived.

1078
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:06,209
<i>She could've lived!</i>

1079
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,746
When we arrive at camp,

1080
01:02:10,537 --> 01:02:13,843
I am sick, but Mama, she
is still strong. She get picked

1081
01:02:13,868 --> 01:02:15,961
to go with those who will work,

1082
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:18,588
and I get put in line to go to gas.

1083
01:02:18,806 --> 01:02:21,419
<i>Then, sudden, dogs bark, and</i>

1084
01:02:21,873 --> 01:02:23,487
<i>guard looks away.</i>

1085
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:27,964
Mama, she step quick out of
her line, to come beside me.

1086
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:29,372
She say,

1087
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:33,103
<i>"You are my child. I stay with you."</i>

1088
01:02:33,346 --> 01:02:34,571
<i>As we march,</i>

1089
01:02:34,632 --> 01:02:38,241
Mama, sh-she push me deep into ditch,

1090
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:39,972
where guards do not see,

1091
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:42,179
<i>and she close up space in line.</i>

1092
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:44,557
<i>I hear them march away, and I stay there</i>

1093
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:47,451
<i>till it is dark, till other
prisoner come find me,</i>

1094
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:49,252
and help me into barracks.

1095
01:02:51,945 --> 01:02:54,725
I never see Mama no more.

1096
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:01,665
"You are my child."

1097
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:06,803
<i>She did not abandon me, Papa!</i>

1098
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:10,440
She did not abandon me!

1099
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:35,893
Here's some cocoa.
- Mm! -

1100
01:03:36,442 --> 01:03:39,477
It'll help you sleep.
- Thank you. -

1101
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,808
Lusia, why did you come here?

1102
01:03:51,376 --> 01:03:52,643
I mean,

1103
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:55,980
you hate Papa, and

1104
01:03:56,603 --> 01:04:00,017
we're like strangers. You
said so once yourself. So,

1105
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:01,919
why did you come?

1106
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:05,342
I, um, I come here

1107
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,325
because I tell David

1108
01:04:08,523 --> 01:04:13,230
after everything Is over,
we meet here in America.

1109
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:16,000
What if he doesn't come?

1110
01:04:18,497 --> 01:04:20,204
Well, he has to.

1111
01:04:22,636 --> 01:04:25,943
After all hope is gone in the camp,

1112
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,814
what keep me alive is "David."

1113
01:04:31,717 --> 01:04:33,417
I live for him,

1114
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:36,921
I live for our future.

1115
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:40,991
<i>If all the time that I am doing this,</i>

1116
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,130
he is already dead, then

1117
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,499
life is like

1118
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:53,270
bad, cruel joke of God.

1119
01:04:56,316 --> 01:04:58,542
He, God, would not joke,

1120
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:00,631
make joke like this, no.

1121
01:05:00,656 --> 01:05:03,047
<i>No,</i> I guess not.

1122
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,283
I guess not.

1123
01:05:11,549 --> 01:05:14,353
Rose, my family asked if I
had a girl back in the city.

1124
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:16,293
Oh, yeah? What did you say?

1125
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:17,795
I said, "Yes!"

1126
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:20,363
"Her name is Rose White."

1127
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:23,601
"She is the most special
girl I have ever met."

1128
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:28,439
Well, you shouldn't have given your family
the impression that we were a couple.

1129
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:29,727
Well, aren't we?

1130
01:05:29,752 --> 01:05:31,609
Well, not exactly...

1131
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:33,177
What are we, exactly?

1132
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,112
I don't know.

1133
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:38,649
Come on, w-we're losing it,
we're losing it. Come here.

1134
01:05:43,716 --> 01:05:46,298
What do you mean, you "don't
know"? Is there someone else, Rose?

1135
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:48,726
Who else could I have so much fun with?

1136
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:53,531
Rose, I love you.

1137
01:05:56,476 --> 01:05:58,702
Did you hear what I said? I love you.

1138
01:05:58,727 --> 01:06:01,146
Dan, we go out twice a week.

1139
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:04,001
We laugh, and we have a
good time, and we dance.

1140
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,810
Can't we just keep it like that?
Can't we just have fun together?

1141
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,800
Fun? Is- is that all we are, "fun"?

1142
01:06:09,825 --> 01:06:11,809
<i>Maybe I- I have the
wrong idea, but I thought</i>

1143
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,251
<i>there was a whole lot more
than that going on with us.</i>

1144
01:06:14,394 --> 01:06:17,241
Well, I guess you're just seeing
something that isn't there, that's all.

1145
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:20,471
I think we're in people's way here.
- Rose, I love you! -

1146
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:22,693
I want to be part of your life.

1147
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:24,610
Dan...

1148
01:07:05,797 --> 01:07:07,471
I worry about you.

1149
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:11,308
I went out for a walk after work. I'm fine.

1150
01:07:12,331 --> 01:07:14,265
You are out so late, and, uh,

1151
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,113
this is all you say?

1152
01:07:16,562 --> 01:07:18,816
You're not my father, Lusia.

1153
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:20,484
This I know.

1154
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:30,283
I make you angry?

1155
01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:34,274
Everything was so simple
before you came here.

1156
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:37,668
I knew who I was, and I knew
where I belonged. It was simple!

1157
01:07:43,857 --> 01:07:47,277
Well, soon I will find a place
to live, for me and David.

1158
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:06,497
Come.

1159
01:08:10,442 --> 01:08:12,309
I'm sorry about what I said.

1160
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:14,405
Okay.

1161
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,441
I just...

1162
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:20,412
I just had this memory.

1163
01:08:20,437 --> 01:08:21,631
Good memory?

1164
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:23,080
Yeah.

1165
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:25,649
I was, um...

1166
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:28,292
I think I was around three,

1167
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:32,389
and, uh, I'd had this terrible nightmare.

1168
01:08:32,414 --> 01:08:34,992
And, I went running over to your bed,

1169
01:08:35,017 --> 01:08:38,195
and you said I could come in, and...

1170
01:08:38,673 --> 01:08:41,598
and we snuggled together
for a little while, and...

1171
01:08:42,644 --> 01:08:46,783
and you told me this funny
story about these two mice

1172
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:49,093
that lived downstairs in the basement.

1173
01:08:49,118 --> 01:08:50,574
And, uh,

1174
01:08:50,678 --> 01:08:53,544
next thing I knew, I
was laughing so hard, I'd

1175
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,180
forgotten all about the bad dream.

1176
01:08:58,144 --> 01:09:00,484
I remember.
- <i>You do?</i> -

1177
01:09:27,305 --> 01:09:28,748
Can you get it off?

1178
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:34,084
No, it's forever.

1179
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,973
It should not come off.

1180
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:39,136
Why?

1181
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:43,894
If I let go, who will remember?

1182
01:09:44,236 --> 01:09:46,363
That is why I am alive.

1183
01:09:50,472 --> 01:09:53,337
Lusia, I know what you
went through during the war is

1184
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:56,874
<i>much worse than anything
I could imagine, but</i>

1185
01:09:58,768 --> 01:10:00,878
before then, you were...

1186
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:04,648
You were blessed.

1187
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:07,317
Blessed?
- <i>Yeah.</i> -

1188
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:11,388
<i>'Cause, every night, when you
went to sleep, Mama was there, and</i>

1189
01:10:12,181 --> 01:10:14,898
<i>when you fell down, and you
hurt yourself, she picked you up,</i>

1190
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:17,561
<i>and told you everything
was gonna be alright.</i>

1191
01:10:19,741 --> 01:10:22,274
Papa didn't hold me in his arms, and..

1192
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:24,556
and he

1193
01:10:24,718 --> 01:10:30,474
never made me feel like
I was his special little girl, and

1194
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:35,712
he even robbed me of my memories of her.

1195
01:10:39,018 --> 01:10:40,018
I...

1196
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,056
I truly believe that I would trade five
years in hell for one day with Mama.

1197
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,563
Excuse me.

1198
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,899
- Yes? -
I'm looking for information

1199
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,767
about my son-in-law.

1200
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,392
Due to arrive today?

1201
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,871
No, no. He is missing.

1202
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:11,342
I need to know if he's found.
- Name? -

1203
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:15,379
<i>David Pechenik.</i>
- "Pechenik." -

1204
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:19,283
Pechenik, from Czerniejewo, <i>Poland.</i>

1205
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:27,424
<i>No. No, I'm</i> sorry, there's nothing on him.

1206
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,382
Are you sure?
- <i>Yes.</i> -

1207
01:11:29,688 --> 01:11:31,882
But, the names change every day.

1208
01:11:32,002 --> 01:11:33,442
Yeah, I know that.

1209
01:11:33,946 --> 01:11:36,067
We might have more
information during the week.

1210
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:37,092
<i>Thank you.</i>

1211
01:11:37,615 --> 01:11:38,802
I'll be back.

1212
01:11:44,422 --> 01:11:47,378
<i>You look for someone?</i>

1213
01:11:52,805 --> 01:11:53,805
Yes.

1214
01:11:53,972 --> 01:11:54,972
<i>Who?</i>

1215
01:11:57,495 --> 01:11:58,844
My son-in-law.

1216
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:01,371
From where?

1217
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:04,128
Poland. Czerniejewo.

1218
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:06,910
Come with me.

1219
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:31,208
What is it?
- Shh. -

1220
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:37,828
I have lists.

1221
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:38,853
Lists?

1222
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:42,466
For six years, since
beginning, I have lists.

1223
01:12:42,611 --> 01:12:44,434
Names from camps.

1224
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:47,210
Who live, who escape, who die.

1225
01:12:47,235 --> 01:12:49,640
I copy neat. Hide.

1226
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,409
Each day, add more names.

1227
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:54,745
Show me.

1228
01:13:02,688 --> 01:13:04,181
So, where are those lists?

1229
01:13:04,206 --> 01:13:07,402
No, no. I don't give. Not
to them, or to anybody.

1230
01:13:07,427 --> 01:13:08,926
I sell.

1231
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:11,762
You sell?

1232
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:15,492
You're trading with human lives?

1233
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:18,088
Oh, sir, do not get me wrong. Understand...

1234
01:13:18,113 --> 01:13:19,383
Just get away, wood man.

1235
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:21,127
Hey, wait! Wait, wait, wait. I tell you.

1236
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:22,506
Look at me.

1237
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,261
I used to be bricklayer.

1238
01:13:24,286 --> 01:13:26,450
I build houses. I had family.

1239
01:13:26,475 --> 01:13:29,553
Now, I am ghost. I
cannot even lift a brick.

1240
01:13:29,578 --> 01:13:31,325
I have no trade no more.

1241
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:35,119
My life's work is the list. I sell.
- Not <i>to me.</i> -

1242
01:13:58,504 --> 01:13:59,704
Did I wake you?

1243
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,545
Is alright.

1244
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:04,274
I look at clock,

1245
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:06,683
and I cannot believe my eyes!

1246
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:10,876
Is almost 12, I sleep so late!
- Oh, that's what Sundays are for. -

1247
01:14:10,901 --> 01:14:12,856
<i>I planned a picnic, but it
looks like it's gonna rain,</i>

1248
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,758
<i>so I thought we'd just have it right here.</i>

1249
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:17,094
Here?
- <i>Yeah, here.</i> -

1250
01:14:18,339 --> 01:14:20,437
Is enough for ten people!

1251
01:14:20,462 --> 01:14:22,559
Well, your appetite is improving.

1252
01:14:23,915 --> 01:14:25,235
Who'd that be?

1253
01:14:29,393 --> 01:14:30,707
Who is it?

1254
01:14:31,382 --> 01:14:33,091
<i>Rayzel, it's me.</i>

1255
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:34,812
<i>Papa?</i>

1256
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:40,017
<i>You think I got nothing better to do all
day than stand here, ringing your bell?</i>

1257
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,005
No, no.

1258
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,030
Here you go.

1259
01:14:43,315 --> 01:14:46,056
What's he doing here, now?
- <i>I don't know.</i> -

1260
01:14:46,432 --> 01:14:48,953
Cheese! Hide the cheese.
I'm supposed to keep Kosher.

1261
01:14:48,978 --> 01:14:50,580
Oh, and ham.

1262
01:14:50,605 --> 01:14:51,989
Oh, ham. Let's move it.

1263
01:14:52,014 --> 01:14:53,014
Okay.

1264
01:14:57,896 --> 01:14:59,545
Is that everything?
- I think so. -

1265
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:00,570
<i>Milk!</i>

1266
01:15:00,739 --> 01:15:01,779
Milk...

1267
01:15:17,775 --> 01:15:19,389
Coming, coming.

1268
01:15:22,994 --> 01:15:24,361
Hello, Papa.

1269
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:30,154
Not dressed yet?
- No, not yet. Come in, -

1270
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:31,268
come in.

1271
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:41,245
Morning, Papa.

1272
01:15:42,314 --> 01:15:44,047
Good afternoon.

1273
01:15:49,468 --> 01:15:51,588
What goes on here?
- Picnic. -

1274
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,904
Would you like to sit down?

1275
01:15:54,793 --> 01:15:56,426
Rayzel was, uh,

1276
01:15:56,724 --> 01:16:01,131
finish cleaning up the table,
so we decide to eat on the floor.

1277
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:04,234
So, if I sweep the floor,

1278
01:16:04,798 --> 01:16:07,738
we will, maybe, eat on the table.

1279
01:16:11,058 --> 01:16:12,968
W-would you like a glass of tea?

1280
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:16,313
<i>No, thank you. I'm here
on important business.</i>

1281
01:16:16,903 --> 01:16:19,783
<i>This</i> morning, I go down to the

1282
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:23,687
Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.

1283
01:16:24,004 --> 01:16:27,324
And you find out something? <i>You find...</i>
- Patience, patience. -

1284
01:16:28,093 --> 01:16:29,893
I ask the clerk

1285
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:35,332
to take a look at the new lists,
but she sees no David Pechenik.

1286
01:16:36,031 --> 01:16:41,605
So, I'm ready to leave, when starts
to talk to me a man. I should say,

1287
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:45,509
half a man. <i>Thin, black teeth.</i>

1288
01:16:45,756 --> 01:16:48,812
<i>He tells me something incredible.</i>

1289
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,904
What?
- <i>What? What did he say,</i> Papa? -

1290
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:52,429
<i>That he has lists.</i>

1291
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:55,812
Lists of what happen in
the last six year in Poland,

1292
01:16:55,837 --> 01:16:57,921
<i>from back in the beginning of the war.</i>

1293
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,556
Of course, I asked him,

1294
01:16:59,671 --> 01:17:02,506
"Show me the lists. I'm
looking for my son-in-law."

1295
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:06,262
But, he says that he will
not show the lists to nobody.

1296
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:09,800
That he will only sell.
<i>So, I'm furious, and</i>

1297
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:13,170
I go away.
- <i>Papa!</i> -

1298
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:15,305
Then I stop,

1299
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:17,282
and

1300
01:17:17,307 --> 01:17:19,009
I feel in my

1301
01:17:19,358 --> 01:17:21,849
jacket pocket, near my heart,

1302
01:17:21,881 --> 01:17:24,781
<i>an envelope full of money. Your money.</i>

1303
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:27,025
<i>And, I hear your voice saying,</i>

1304
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,656
"He needs money for food and cloathe, and"

1305
01:17:29,681 --> 01:17:32,990
"he suffered. Now he wants
to live like the rest of us."

1306
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:35,478
<i>So, I go back to him</i>

1307
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:38,568
I give him some money...

1308
01:17:38,593 --> 01:17:40,831
Too much, if you ask me.

1309
01:17:43,179 --> 01:17:46,603
...and, he gives me this.

1310
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,773
..."David Pechenik"

1311
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,155
He's alive.

1312
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:00,639
<i>He's alive,</i>

1313
01:18:01,634 --> 01:18:04,709
and he lives in a small
village, near Katowice.

1314
01:18:04,734 --> 01:18:06,156
Still in Poland.

1315
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:15,151
<i>Papa,</i>

1316
01:18:19,337 --> 01:18:20,337
Papa,

1317
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,975
oh, thank you, Papa.

1318
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:35,338
Lusia

1319
01:18:36,339 --> 01:18:38,355
<i>My Lusia</i>

1320
01:18:39,459 --> 01:18:40,991
Papa

1321
01:18:42,933 --> 01:18:45,046
<i>The toilet is in the hall.</i>

1322
01:18:45,071 --> 01:18:47,932
- <i>Uh, huh.</i> -
<i>The room has much dirt, but</i>

1323
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,194
<i>pay no concern. I clean very well.</i>

1324
01:18:50,219 --> 01:18:52,211
<i>Yeah,</i> it's lovely.

1325
01:18:52,236 --> 01:18:55,085
Just needs a little, uh,
paint and wallpaper.

1326
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:57,835
Ah, David and I...

1327
01:18:58,269 --> 01:18:59,785
I will make this

1328
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:01,505
a beautiful room.

1329
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:03,173
I'll make you some curtains.

1330
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:06,510
Strange.

1331
01:19:06,535 --> 01:19:07,535
What?

1332
01:19:07,699 --> 01:19:08,945
This, uh,

1333
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:12,913
this gesture of you make
with your hands sometimes,

1334
01:19:12,938 --> 01:19:14,885
Mama used to do it too.

1335
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,230
I'm gonna help you paint, too.

1336
01:19:19,712 --> 01:19:21,124
I'm very good at it.

1337
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:24,328
Oh, Rayzel, I start to feel happy again.

1338
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:30,567
David comes to arrive in
two weeks. I can't believe this.

1339
01:19:32,826 --> 01:19:35,105
It's too good to be true...

1340
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:43,147
Are you happy?

1341
01:19:43,309 --> 01:19:45,582
Yeah, sure. Why shouldn't I be?

1342
01:19:46,624 --> 01:19:50,527
You have special someone
in your life, like David?

1343
01:19:51,217 --> 01:19:53,891
I don't need anybody
special. I got my work.

1344
01:19:58,564 --> 01:20:00,544
I love the plant here.

1345
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:04,174
...what is going to happen to
him when he comes to U.S.?

1346
01:20:05,216 --> 01:20:07,971
His English is worse, even, than mine.

1347
01:20:08,528 --> 01:20:10,961
We'll give him a job in the storeroom.

1348
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:12,776
We need a strong man in there.

1349
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:16,914
No, no. No son-in-law of
mine is going to be a stock boy.

1350
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:17,939
Big shot.

1351
01:20:19,067 --> 01:20:23,387
Oh, and we'll give the young couple
a dining room set to get them started.

1352
01:20:23,412 --> 01:20:25,882
And the green table lamps.
Where did we get them?

1353
01:20:25,907 --> 01:20:27,744
<i>Cousin Max.</i>
- <i>Oh, Max!</i> -

1354
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:29,449
Max would be furious.

1355
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:31,089
<i>Thank you.</i>

1356
01:20:31,971 --> 01:20:32,971
<i>So,</i>

1357
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:34,103
Rayzel,

1358
01:20:34,128 --> 01:20:35,808
what's new at your store?

1359
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,939
Well, my boss
- <i>Lusia,</i> -

1360
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:40,419
a woman who's
- <i>did you ever learn</i> -

1361
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:42,786
way above me, asked me to...
- <i>to make your grandmother's dumplings?</i> -

1362
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:46,577
They were as light as
feathers, and so delicious!

1363
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:51,316
So, is, uh, rayon popular
with the ladies these days?

1364
01:20:51,341 --> 01:20:52,616
I can't keep it in the store.
- <i>Imagine</i> -

1365
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:55,472
It's always my thing, so I...
- <i>I come to the house of my daughter</i> -

1366
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:58,388
and her husband for dinner.

1367
01:20:58,530 --> 01:20:59,730
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

1368
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:02,933
<i>I have a family. A family!</i>
- <i>Oh, it's a miracle, yes.</i> -

1369
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,662
You always had your
family. You just <i>never noticed.</i>

1370
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:14,605
What's the matter with her?

1371
01:21:15,153 --> 01:21:16,793
Nothing. Forget it.

1372
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:19,284
<i>No, no, you wanted to
say something. Say it.</i>

1373
01:21:19,444 --> 01:21:20,444
Say it.

1374
01:21:20,759 --> 01:21:22,459
What? What?

1375
01:21:24,977 --> 01:21:27,217
Do you see me at all?

1376
01:21:30,915 --> 01:21:31,915
Me,

1377
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,660
your daughter, I'm looking right at
you. But, you don't see me, do you?

1378
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:38,722
I don't see you?
- <i>No.</i> -

1379
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:41,431
What do you mean?
- You've never seen me. -

1380
01:21:42,428 --> 01:21:44,268
Well, I don't need you.

1381
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:48,105
Rose White doesn't need you.

1382
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:50,527
Rayzel, ha-have some "kashedan."

1383
01:21:50,552 --> 01:21:52,329
Rose White? Who's she talking about?

1384
01:21:53,111 --> 01:21:54,111
<i>Me.</i>

1385
01:21:55,353 --> 01:21:56,813
You, Rayzel?

1386
01:21:56,838 --> 01:21:58,481
I don't understand anything.

1387
01:21:58,506 --> 01:22:01,151
<i>It doesn't mean anything,
"Rose White."</i> It's for her-

1388
01:22:01,176 --> 01:22:03,233
for her business, for her career.

1389
01:22:03,258 --> 01:22:05,103
<i>It doesn't mean anything! It's...</i>

1390
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:06,560
"Rose White"?

1391
01:22:07,284 --> 01:22:09,126
You changed your name?

1392
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:11,194
Yes.

1393
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:15,465
You throw away my name?

1394
01:22:17,336 --> 01:22:19,436
<i>You deny your family?</i>

1395
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,908
You are Rayzel Weiss,

1396
01:22:25,538 --> 01:22:27,937
<i>and you will always be Rayzel Weiss,</i>

1397
01:22:27,962 --> 01:22:29,232
or you're not my daughter!

1398
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:31,256
Oh, Mordechai!
- Mordechai, please... -

1399
01:22:31,281 --> 01:22:33,150
My name is the only thing

1400
01:22:33,767 --> 01:22:34,951
I had to give to her.

1401
01:22:34,976 --> 01:22:36,880
<i>No, you gave her more than that, Mordechai.</i>

1402
01:22:36,905 --> 01:22:38,900
<i>This is not an orde...</i>
- Is that what you think? -

1403
01:22:38,925 --> 01:22:41,826
Is that what you thought all these years?

1404
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:43,361
What about love, Papa?

1405
01:22:43,386 --> 01:22:44,968
- Love... -
Yes, love!

1406
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:46,256
What do you know about love?

1407
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:47,911
Enough, enough, please!

1408
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,533
<i>You never wanted my love.</i>

1409
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:52,415
- <i>How</i> can you say that? -
Every time I tried,

1410
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,863
You push me away.

1411
01:22:53,888 --> 01:22:55,955
- That's not true. -
It is true!

1412
01:22:56,288 --> 01:22:58,621
I left behind my wife, my home,

1413
01:22:58,646 --> 01:23:00,023
my firstborn.

1414
01:23:00,048 --> 01:23:03,213
<i>All I had was you, and
you did not want me.</i>

1415
01:23:03,969 --> 01:23:05,849
I didn't want you?

1416
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,279
That's ridiculous!
- You did not want me, and you know why?

1417
01:23:09,304 --> 01:23:10,387
You know why?

1418
01:23:10,897 --> 01:23:12,830
<i>Because, you never forgave me</i>

1419
01:23:13,004 --> 01:23:15,464
for taking you away from your mama.

1420
01:23:23,863 --> 01:23:24,863
Rayzel!

1421
01:23:24,888 --> 01:23:26,797
- <i>Lusia, you stay.</i> -
Papa!

1422
01:23:30,655 --> 01:23:32,111
She is in pain.

1423
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:35,078
<i>If you want to be part</i>
of this family, you stay!

1424
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,585
Mordechai...

1425
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,179
I'm sorry Papa hurt you.

1426
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,732
It's alright.

1427
01:25:06,266 --> 01:25:07,266
Rayzel,

1428
01:25:09,236 --> 01:25:12,113
I did a terrible thing.

1429
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,560
What?

1430
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,816
<i>When you ask</i>

1431
01:25:15,841 --> 01:25:19,680
if Mama s-spoke about you,

1432
01:25:20,927 --> 01:25:22,281
I say no.

1433
01:25:22,858 --> 01:25:24,625
She did talk about me?

1434
01:25:25,447 --> 01:25:26,447
Mm-hmm.

1435
01:25:27,472 --> 01:25:28,922
I should have

1436
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:31,525
give you this before,

1437
01:25:31,981 --> 01:25:36,569
but I was afraid it cause
you too much to hurt,

1438
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:39,066
and, instead, <i>I hurt you.</i>

1439
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:40,401
What is it?

1440
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,803
Is for you,

1441
01:25:44,485 --> 01:25:45,672
from Mama.

1442
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:51,745
She write it before they take us,
but she never get a chance to mail.

1443
01:25:53,677 --> 01:25:55,549
I keep all this time.

1444
01:25:56,464 --> 01:25:57,784
Now,

1445
01:25:58,017 --> 01:25:59,319
you should have.

1446
01:26:04,705 --> 01:26:06,326
It's in Polish.

1447
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:09,143
I can't read it. Can you translate?

1448
01:26:09,168 --> 01:26:10,168
Sure.

1449
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:16,036
"My dearest daughter, Rayzel,"

1450
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:19,506
"for long time, I have written,"

1451
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:24,397
"and I know it could happen
that you don't get the letters."

1452
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:29,216
"This one is meant by
God's will to reach you."

1453
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:31,952
"Maybe, it is the last one."

1454
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:35,755
<i>"I want to tell you everything."</i>

1455
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:43,196
<i>"I cannot hold you in my arms,
but I hold you anyway in my heart."</i>

1456
01:26:43,662 --> 01:26:48,902
<i>"This is true for every day in
your life, since you was born."</i>

1457
01:26:49,547 --> 01:26:54,083
<i>"Sometime, with God's
blessing, you will have a child,"</i>

1458
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,776
<i>"and you will know what I mean."</i>

1459
01:26:57,281 --> 01:27:01,648
<i>"I want to send you
something; your baby spoon,"</i>

1460
01:27:01,852 --> 01:27:02,976
<i>"or,"</i>

1461
01:27:03,001 --> 01:27:08,121
<i>"old toy. But, this letter
will not hold that, so"</i>

1462
01:27:08,592 --> 01:27:12,559
<i>"I have pasted a lock of my hair in it."</i>

1463
01:27:12,949 --> 01:27:20,634
<i>"You try, and remember your Mama
when it was as yellow as golden sun."</i>

1464
01:27:21,592 --> 01:27:25,579
"I cannot think of anything more to"

1465
01:27:25,834 --> 01:27:27,874
"say, right now."

1466
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:32,746
"I have no advice to give to you."

1467
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:36,917
"You cannot put life on piece of paper."

1468
01:27:38,016 --> 01:27:42,490
"I am not a smart person
with writing down words, but"

1469
01:27:42,515 --> 01:27:47,060
"I wish you understand how I feel <i>for you,"</i>

1470
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,796
<i>"my pretty little girl."</i>

1471
01:27:50,472 --> 01:27:52,351
<i>"Your only mother,"</i>

1472
01:27:52,376 --> 01:27:54,908
"Luba Eissmann Weiss."

1473
01:28:04,184 --> 01:28:06,813
Love does not die.

1474
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,211
Time cannot kill it.

1475
01:28:10,469 --> 01:28:13,985
Nor even many miles, nor even death.

1476
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:54,255
By the way, Rose, I still have
some tickets left for the picnic.

1477
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:56,624
Oh, I have my ticket, Miss Ryan.

1478
01:28:58,978 --> 01:29:02,383
Rose, whoever fills the position
of Second Assistant Buyer

1479
01:29:02,408 --> 01:29:06,701
is going to be making decisions that
could cost the store thousands of dollars.

1480
01:29:07,388 --> 01:29:10,452
So, I need a self-assured
individual, with a clear picture of

1481
01:29:10,477 --> 01:29:12,744
who she is, and where she's going.

1482
01:29:13,122 --> 01:29:15,410
Does this describe you?

1483
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:18,896
No, ma'am.

1484
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:21,722
Good.

1485
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:23,164
Pardon me?

1486
01:29:23,411 --> 01:29:24,979
That was honest.

1487
01:29:25,422 --> 01:29:27,889
You didn't make excuses. I like that.

1488
01:29:28,314 --> 01:29:32,527
You did, however, make two mistakes
in processing the Lombardi order.

1489
01:29:36,428 --> 01:29:39,668
Something is affecting your work,
and I'm very concerned about you.

1490
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,479
You know, Rose,

1491
01:29:46,393 --> 01:29:48,610
<i>you have a fine future ahead of you, with</i>

1492
01:29:48,635 --> 01:29:51,546
many choices that nobody
else can make for you.

1493
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:53,648
Only you know what you have to do.

1494
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:14,075
Papa?

1495
01:30:28,822 --> 01:30:30,118
<i>David...</i>

1496
01:30:33,916 --> 01:30:34,970
David!

1497
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:38,547
Lusia!

1498
01:30:38,572 --> 01:30:40,361
David!
- <i>Lusia!</i> -

1499
01:30:44,793 --> 01:30:46,134
Lusia.

1500
01:31:30,738 --> 01:31:31,738
Hi.

1501
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:33,734
Hi.

1502
01:31:45,814 --> 01:31:47,829
I've missed my dancing partner.

1503
01:31:49,785 --> 01:31:50,965
So have I.

1504
01:31:55,517 --> 01:31:56,517
Well,

1505
01:31:56,897 --> 01:31:57,897
goodnight.

1506
01:31:57,922 --> 01:31:58,940
Goodnight.

1507
01:32:01,585 --> 01:32:03,411
Would you like to walk me home?

1508
01:32:22,932 --> 01:32:24,372
This is my mother,

1509
01:32:24,535 --> 01:32:26,395
Luba Eissmann Weiss.

1510
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:27,762
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

1511
01:32:27,787 --> 01:32:29,137
Thank you.

1512
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,607
And, this is my father, Mordechai Weiss.

1513
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:35,510
This is my sister, Lusia.

1514
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,480
<i>She was found in the camps.</i>

1515
01:32:39,795 --> 01:32:41,883
<i>My mother died</i> there.

1516
01:32:42,494 --> 01:32:45,787
She was living with me while she was
waiting for her husband, David Pechenik.

1517
01:32:45,812 --> 01:32:47,822
They were separated in the war, but

1518
01:32:48,278 --> 01:32:50,491
now he's back, and they're together.

1519
01:32:52,258 --> 01:32:53,674
And, this...

1520
01:32:56,686 --> 01:32:58,166
this is me,

1521
01:32:59,348 --> 01:33:01,102
<i>Rayzel Weiss.</i>

1522
01:33:21,954 --> 01:33:25,590
<i>[speaking foreign tongue]</i>

1523
01:33:29,102 --> 01:33:30,895
Let's get started.

1524
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:32,964
The sun will set soon.

1525
01:33:32,989 --> 01:33:35,533
Oh, we still have a few more minutes.

1526
01:33:35,558 --> 01:33:40,872
I mean, this is Lusia's
first Shabbos in her own home,

1527
01:33:41,214 --> 01:33:43,541
and the whole family isn't here.

1528
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:46,068
Family is here.

1529
01:33:46,093 --> 01:33:49,387
Papa...
- I said, the family is here. -

1530
01:33:49,651 --> 01:33:51,682
Lusia, light the candles.

1531
01:34:13,366 --> 01:34:15,406
There's no time for visitors.

1532
01:34:16,137 --> 01:34:17,475
Papa,

1533
01:34:17,838 --> 01:34:19,544
this is our home.

1534
01:34:19,804 --> 01:34:21,746
<i>I have listened enough.</i>

1535
01:34:24,724 --> 01:34:27,118
Ah, good Shabbos!

1536
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,647
David, look who's here.

1537
01:34:29,947 --> 01:34:31,196
<i>Good</i> Shabbos.

1538
01:34:31,221 --> 01:34:34,467
- Good Shabbos. -
Uh, welcome to our home, Rayzel.

1539
01:34:34,492 --> 01:34:35,852
Thank you, David.

1540
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:39,931
I was just about to light the candles.

1541
01:34:40,654 --> 01:34:42,767
Um, let me get you a chair.

1542
01:34:45,339 --> 01:34:47,705
<i>Mordechai, please...</i>

1543
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:01,586
Papa, please don't do this.

1544
01:35:08,355 --> 01:35:11,396
This is our last chance to be a family;

1545
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:16,467
<i>to accept each other as we are,</i>

1546
01:35:16,492 --> 01:35:18,570
and to go on with our lives.

1547
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:23,207
Just listen to her, Papa.

1548
01:35:23,882 --> 01:35:25,410
Just listen.

1549
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:32,650
I've forgiven you.

1550
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:36,955
Can you forgive me?

1551
01:35:55,389 --> 01:35:56,774
You look

1552
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:59,243
just like your mother.

1553
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:07,865
I love you, Papa.

1554
01:36:10,816 --> 01:36:12,190
[speaking foreign tongue]

1555
01:36:16,082 --> 01:36:18,756
<i>Aw, Shimon, look.</i>
- <i>Papa, the sun is setting.</i> -

1556
01:36:18,781 --> 01:36:20,061
We should start.

1557
01:36:20,086 --> 01:36:22,326
<i>So, who is</i> stopping you?</i>

1558
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:36,581
This is my first Shabbos

1559
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:41,786
in my new home, in my new country,

1560
