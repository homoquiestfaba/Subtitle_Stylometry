1
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:04,485
Bring him outside.
I will do the rest.

2
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:13,697
What was that, your boyfriend?

3
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:23,401
Let's say you are
who you say you are.

4
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:28,106
-What can you do for me?
-What do you want?

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,786
I want immunity from prosecution,
asylum in the U.S. and citizenship.

6
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,522
How about a condo on South Beach
and a rich boyfriend?

7
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:39,750
Those I can get for myself.

8
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,325
-What do you want?
-I need to know more about Anarchy 99.

9
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:46,997
You want to know about Anarchy 99?

10
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:51,204
You've seen the girls,
the clubs, the parties.

11
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:55,103
What you don't see
is what goes on during the day.

12
00:00:55,709 --> 00:01:00,806
There's been a lot of activity in the
last year. People coming in and out.

13
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:04,849
-Russian scientists.
-Well, what are they up to?

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,447
They go in the basement
and I'm not allowed in.

15
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:11,857
Now's a good time for you
to get invited.

16
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:18,455
Yorgi knows you're an agent.
Kirill is waiting with his rifle.

17
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:25,895
-Where--?
-Don't look!

18
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:28,975
There's a back door.

19
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,404
They'll know you warned me.

20
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,071
If you go out the front,
he'll put a bullet in your eye.

21
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,321
-You still packing?
-Always.

22
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,461
Get ready to use it.

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,526
-What's your plan?
-He's still in love with you.

24
00:01:56,704 --> 00:02:02,074
-He'll wait for a clear shot.
-That's your plan? Thank you. Great.

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,458
Draw!

26
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:18,982
He's on the way.

27
00:03:56,657 --> 00:04:01,185
Gibbons! My favorite kidnapper.
Next time send a limo.

28
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:10,697
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

29
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:15,001
You already broke me.
No need to get cruel and unusual.

30
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,605
A ticket? Now, that's funny.

31
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,375
-Where am I going to go now?
-Home.

32
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,173
Home?

33
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,783
Your cover's blown.
You're not useful.

34
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,286
That's it? I'm done?

35
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:33,085
No tricks. We have enough intel
to move forward.

36
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,129
-With what?
-Sweeper team: quick, clean, effective.

37
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:41,233
Don't worry about it.
It'll all be over soon.

38
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:45,135
You mean a sweeper team
to come in and kill everybody?

39
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:48,069
Not all of them are as bad
as you think.

40
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:52,269
You had to shoot a cop. How
"not as bad as I think" could they be?

41
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:54,607
Okay, look.

42
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,579
We've got a complication.
There's a girl. Yelena.

43
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,242
There's always a girl.

44
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,447
She wants out and I sent her back in
to get more intel for you.

45
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,686
There's no time to play favorites.
The cards have been dealt.

46
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:11,524
What do you mean
the cards have been dealt?

47
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,996
You don't even know her, man.

48
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:19,060
Oh, by the way, that bank number
you gave us?

49
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:25,372
Your friends and Yelena have made
some large cash transfers...

50
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,777
...to a group of Russian scientists
known to specialize and traffic...

51
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,544
...in biological weapons.

52
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:36,054
-She had nothing to do with it.
-Go home.

53
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,157
-She ain't--!
-That's an order.

54
00:05:58,512 --> 00:05:59,501
How's it going?

55
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,977
Life is shit!

56
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:03,012
Yeah, well what can you do?

57
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:59,760
Through this door,
you are with us to the end.

58
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,266
-Are you sure that's what you want?
-I'm sure.

59
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:47,900
This is <i>Ahab</i>. Think of it as
solar-powered submarine.

60
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:51,076
It can circumnavigate the globe
to reach its target.

61
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:56,180
It need only surface to gather sunshine
and to do its business.

62
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,279
What is it? What's its business?

63
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:04,782
Dropping off presents to all
the good little boys and girls.

64
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:17,427
My team will be finished tomorrow.

65
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:18,993
How about you?

66
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,838
We're finished now.

67
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:55,732
Nikolai!

68
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,033
Bring the rockets.

69
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:38,149
The detonator is for you.

70
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:30,366
Yorgi! The binary agents are mixing...

71
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:32,630
...it will kill us all!

72
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:45,341
Looks like little white mouse.

73
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,686
Bye-bye, little mouse.

74
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,841
My God.

75
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:15,499
They did their job
and now they were liability.

76
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:20,173
We don't need anyone
talking about our business.

77
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:30,216
The gas gets sucked through the
extractor fans, passed into water...

78
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,349
...and broken down to become,
once again, completely harmless.

79
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:40,031
So quiet.

80
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:46,769
I know now why they call it
Silent Night.

81
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,881
Let's get some food.

82
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:34,119
Find out what's going on!

83
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,582
What the hell was that?

84
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:17,786
That works.

85
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,284
Fire in the hole.

86
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:18,583
Sova. What are you doing here, man?

87
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,209
First you set me up in the bar.
Then you shoot me in the back.

88
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:26,085
My boss does it to me.
I did it to you. It's a vicious circle.

89
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,953
-You think it's funny?
-No.

90
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,823
You didn't take it personally,
did you?

91
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,693
I did what I had to do to get in.
We're on the same side.

92
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,768
I'm sorry. I switched sides.

93
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:42,741
You pushed me too far. My government
doesn't pay as well as Yorgi.

94
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,940
My government pays twice as much--

95
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:48,875
Think you could just walk
into the spy business...

96
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:54,213
-...and have all the angles figured out?
-What are you going to do, shoot me?

97
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,412
Where? In the head, to be quick?

98
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,956
Or in the chest for an open casket,
so I can see your heart?

99
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,150
Can I think about it?

100
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:11,534
What are you doing?!

101
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:15,606
I heard you talking. I could tell
where you were in the room.

102
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:19,767
What are you doing with the Ivans?

103
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:24,842
What's going on?

104
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:28,510
There's something I didn't
have the time to tell you.

105
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:30,747
I'm an agent as well.

106
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:34,359
I'm an agent for FSB,
Russian Intelligence.

107
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,586
You know, like your ClA.

108
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:39,755
-I've been undercover for two years.
-Two years?

109
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,662
What was your plan,
let them die of old age?

110
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,234
There was no plan.

111
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:49,000
A year ago, Intelligence gets
reorganized, I stop getting orders.

112
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,005
They forget about me. And I did what
I must to survive. You understand?

113
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:57,478
What do I understand?
I've been an agent for a week.

114
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,619
But my boss needs to know
what we know now.

115
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,585
-Okay?
-Okay.

116
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:08,787
The submarine's purpose is to deploy
a nerve agent called Silent Night.

117
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:12,192
It's been missing since
the Soviet Union's collapse in '91.

118
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:13,696
It can kill millions.

119
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:16,960
<i>We knew they were up to something.</i>
<i>You found out.</i>

120
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:21,334
-That's excellent work, Triple X.
-There was never a sweeper team.

121
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,844
If I said don't jump off
the Empire State Building....

122
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:29,412
-You're right. I'd definitely do it.
-I inspired you.

123
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:33,074
I'm an authority figure,
that's what I'm supposed to do.

124
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:35,277
Look, my men are on this now.

125
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,856
-<i>It's time for you to come home.</i>
-What about Yelena?

126
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:45,288
<i>I'm not authorized to give her asylum.</i>

127
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,964
<i>But I promise it'll be done</i>
<i>by the time you get here.</i>

128
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:54,430
Come home, Xander. That's an order.

129
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:14,122
How soon can Yorgi launch this thing?

130
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:21,163
You were told to go home!
Your people are handling--

131
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,267
How soon, Yelena?

132
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:28,400
Soon.
But it's not our problem anymore!

133
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:31,509
If they get ahead of schedule,
it's everyone's.

134
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:36,011
He's got an army, a fortress.
You don't stand a chance!

135
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:40,983
I've risked my life for stupid reasons.
This is the first one that makes sense.

136
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:45,681
This is not one of your stunts.
You'll die in this, you know that.

137
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:50,527
If you don't go back in there...

138
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:54,822
...he'll know something's wrong.

139
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:58,732
You can't ask me to go back there.
You can't.

140
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:06,476
You want to know something ironic?
I volunteered for this assignment.

141
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:10,611
I wanted to make a difference.

142
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,378
I fought for it.

143
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:18,453
Then finish it.

144
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:39,406
Remember what I told you,
after you kissed me?

145
00:22:39,846 --> 00:22:42,406
-Never again?
-I lied.

146
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,131
But when you break it down,
I'm a simple man.

147
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:06,464
I'd be happy with a beautiful
Czech girl--

148
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:10,631
Hey, geek!
Got new orders from Gibbons. Get in.

149
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,980
-I want all that in here.
-Done.

150
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:22,552
The castle's covered
with surveillance cameras.

151
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:26,250
That's why we cannot get close enough.

152
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:34,089
Hang on. That's why I need to
knock out the communications tower...

153
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,326
...at the base of the mountain.

154
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:45,137
Is there anyone here
who knows how to fly a plane?

155
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:47,743
I can.

156
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:57,649
Too much turbulence
around these mountains!

157
00:23:57,857 --> 00:24:00,485
Just get me in line with that tower!

158
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,218
I'll do the rest!

159
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:16,997
Go now!

160
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,422
Viktor! We got company!

161
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:48,233
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

162
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:40,561
Nothing like fresh powder.

163
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:21,633
Yelena, my sweet dove,
did you get confused?

164
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:26,774
Your assignment was to kill the cop
after he killed X.

165
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,217
Not good for undercover agent
from Russian lntelligence.

166
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:39,824
I knew about you all along...

167
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:45,123
...and it was my pleasure to twist
you and use you how I saw fit.

168
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:48,193
And you.

169
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:56,005
Of all people,
I thought you'd understand...

170
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,574
...what I'm trying to accomplish.

171
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:01,012
Can you imagine?

172
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:04,807
Imagine a city like Prague vanishing...

173
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:07,986
...in a cloud of poison gas.

174
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:11,486
Then Hamburg, London, Washington.

175
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,326
Imagine not knowing who did it, or why.
And so they turn on each other.

176
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:21,632
These guys attack those guys.
Those guys invade these guys.

177
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,769
Soon, whole world implodes.

178
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:28,134
Imagine governments disappearing.

179
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:30,104
And in the end...

180
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:34,803
...imagine facing absolute,
beautiful freedom.

181
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:42,548
But neither of you will be there
to see it.

182
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,715
Like Viktor.

183
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:51,289
Like Kolya.

184
00:32:37,943 --> 00:32:39,570
Cover me!

185
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,180
Get me out of this thing!

186
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,625
He took the hard drive.
He's going to launch <i>Ahab</i>!

187
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,467
Pick one.

188
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,774
Ivan, take out that nest!

189
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:41,605
You have to turn the safety off.

190
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,792
Hold them off as long as you can.

191
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:11,468
See you, my friend.

192
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:09,787
Come on, baby.

193
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,439
Stop! He's got us pinned down.

194
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,777
Shit.

195
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:28,704
You got a bazooka!

196
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,112
Stop thinking Prague police and start
thinking PlayStation. Blow shit up!

197
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:36,810
This is not bazooka.
This is heat-seeker rocket.

198
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:40,756
Heat-seeker?

199
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,251
Set it.

200
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:50,257
The son of a bitch is smoking.

201
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:09,919
I told him that cigarette
would kill him.

202
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:13,213
Learn how to shoot, piece of shit!

203
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:41,178
Quick! Help me pull him out!

204
00:37:45,717 --> 00:37:47,947
It will hit the city in 30 minutes!

205
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,058
Guys. I need a helicopter.

206
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:08,135
I need transportation.
I need a--

207
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:18,842
X, there you are.
I gave you everything you wanted.

208
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:21,178
This thing will damn near fly now.

209
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:24,254
You screwed me.
Gibbons didn't authorize this.

210
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:26,253
He'll hang us both out to dry.

211
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,289
-Agent Shavers.
-Yeah?

212
00:38:28,593 --> 00:38:31,357
I'm going to give you
a field promotion.

213
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,022
Take over, finish the mop-up.
You're in charge.

214
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,569
Yes, sir! I'm the man for the job!
I won't let you down!

215
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,434
Wait! Wait! Wait!

216
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,770
Almost forgot the manual. You'll need
this.

217
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:47,639
Hey, X. Go kick some ass.

218
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:12,663
That thing must be going 80 mph!
How do we stop it?!

219
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:16,898
We can't! The controls
are on the bubble panel.

220
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,770
-You see it?
-Yeah.

221
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:21,174
The hard drive's in there!

222
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:25,715
You got the manual. See if Shavers
put in anything we could use.

223
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:28,876
-He's got very bad handwriting.
-Come on!

224
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:34,488
Flame throwers, mini-bombs, exploding
hubcaps, rocket launchers!

225
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:38,722
This is a tank.
You can't use any of it on <i>Ahab.</i>

226
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:42,492
Silent Night only breaks down
in deep water.

227
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:45,528
-I'll have to get on it!
-What?

228
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:48,802
I'll have to get on it.

229
00:39:56,014 --> 00:40:00,576
Our surveillance puts <i>Ahab</i>
22 minutes outside of Prague.

230
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:05,484
-We should evacuate the city.
-22 minutes for 1.5 million people?

231
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:09,453
Call air support. We may need
to blow it out of the water.

232
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:12,693
-If we hit that thing--
-This city will die.

233
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:14,991
And the crisis will be contained!

234
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,929
One city's better than 10.

235
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:23,065
Another thing: A blue GTO
is traveling parallel to <i>Ahab</i>.

236
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,417
Shit! Does this road
go back to the river?

237
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:40,188
Come on! Check the GPS!

238
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:45,385
Yes, it does!
Fifteen miles at the town of Davle!

239
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:05,973
There's got to be something here
we could use.

240
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:10,178
Harpoon gun, parachutes
built into seats, ejectable roof.

241
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:12,516
It's all useless!

242
00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:15,289
How far are we?

243
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:20,054
The river is just beyond
the next village.

244
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:32,267
I'm going through!
Use the rocket launcher!

245
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:34,139
-Twenty-two!
-Hit it!

246
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:40,207
That was a flamethrower!
Use the rockets!

247
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:43,582
It's 32! I told you!
I told you he had bad handwriting!

248
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:44,915
Hit it!

249
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:23,192
Shavers loaded this thing.
We're missing something.

250
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:26,362
There are more weapons
here on the back. Look.

251
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:41,038
-Take the wheel!
-What? You're crazy!

252
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:47,082
The brake! The brake!

253
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:51,283
The gas! The gas!

254
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:05,936
X, what are you doing?

255
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:08,670
<i>Five minutes to target.</i>

256
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:16,205
X, talk to me!
What are you doing?

257
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:19,540
-You said there was an ejectable roof.
-Right here!

258
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:20,775
Hit it!

259
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,459
Shit! lt's out of range!

260
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:41,071
-There's a bridge! Cross the bridge!
-Okay.

261
00:43:55,787 --> 00:43:56,879
Come on.

262
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:01,550
Come on!

263
00:44:03,928 --> 00:44:06,294
-Got you!
-Yes!

264
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:10,991
-I wish I had a camera!
-What you talking about?

265
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:13,660
This is gonna be one hell of a trick.

266
00:45:09,127 --> 00:45:10,788
<i>Three minutes to target.</i>

267
00:47:02,674 --> 00:47:04,301
<i>One minute to target.</i>

268
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:07,003
Move! Move! Move!

269
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:09,446
Out of the way!

270
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:29,728
Eyes!

271
00:47:46,651 --> 00:47:48,414
<i>Ten seconds to target.</i>

272
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:58,952
<i>Target in sight.</i>

273
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:03,165
Call the jets off.
Tell the jets to stand down!

274
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:18,481
Welcome to the Xander zone!

275
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:04,159
Zero contamination level. I understand,
sir. Zero contamination level.

276
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:16,832
You Yelena?

277
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:19,937
Mr. Gibbons.

278
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:23,509
I promised Xander
you could go to America.

279
00:49:24,115 --> 00:49:25,912
I'm a man of my word.

280
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:29,018
It doesn't make much difference now,
does it?

281
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:58,143
He's alive! He's alive! Come here!

282
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:09,350
Get him out of there, double-time.
Go! Move!

283
00:50:11,562 --> 00:50:14,554
-Bora Bora!
-What? I can't hear you!

284
00:50:18,002 --> 00:50:19,594
Bora Bora.

285
00:50:45,429 --> 00:50:46,623
You're getting burnt.

286
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,135
<i>Xander, you there?</i>

287
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:58,606
<i>I know you're there, Xander. I've got</i>
<i>you here on satellite magnification.</i>

288
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:06,450
<i>Call me. We got a whole</i>
<i>new thing to talk about.</i>

289
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:09,850
<i>Something very important has come up.</i>

290
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:12,379
<i>Oh, by the way...</i>

291
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,850
<i>...you passed the test.</i>
<i>The Gibbons test.</i>

292
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,990
You gotta be kidding me.
