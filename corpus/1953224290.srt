1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:06,168
(Marnie) Two years ago.
Before I even knew I was a witch.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,606
That was the last time
I was in Halloweentown.

3
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,373
My mom Gwen.
My grandma Aggie. My sister Sophie

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,284
and my brother Dylan and I
all had to join together

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,518
and use the power of the Cromwell
witch family to defeat Kalabar.

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,153
An evil warlock who's had a thing
for my mother since they were teenagers.

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,695
Halloweentown
was always a happy place

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:41,036
where creatures of different sizes
and shapes and species...

9
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,337
some of them downright weird...

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,141
could live apart from the real world
in peace and harmony.

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,280
So. After we saved Halloweentown.

12
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,344
Grandma decided
to leave her comfy house there

13
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,084
and live with our family
in the mortal world.

14
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,926
Now it's Halloween night again.

15
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:07,695
The only night we can pass freely
between Halloweentown and our world.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,368
I'm thinking about Halloweentown.

17
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,463
I wonder how it's changed.

18
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:23,680
Grandma says things in Halloweentown
are always changing.

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,211
I know nothing has changed at our house.

20
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,088
Mom and Grandma are fighting again.

21
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,789
(female computer voice)
What's going on at your party?

22
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,526
Ehh... I'm avoiding it.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,171
Why?
What's the matter?

24
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,309
(Sophie) Marnie,
Grandma wants you to come down.

25
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,354
([music] rock)

26
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,220
One per customer, please.

27
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:12,524
Yes, we have hats for everybody.
Everybody, now, don't...

28
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,295
Don't fight. No fighting.
Witches don't fight.

29
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,860
Oh, now, if you're going to be
real witches and warlocks,

30
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,738
we need brooms, too, right?
Here we go.

31
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,485
Ooh! Magic, magic, brooms, brooms.
There you are, dear.

32
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,421
You got here just at the
right time, Marnie.

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,584
Now, perhaps you'd like
to take our little partygoers

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,061
for a little spin around the house.

35
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,860
Grandma, I don't think
this is a very good idea.

36
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,231
What? Oh, fiddle.

37
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,534
I can't let your mother
spoil my fun every day of the year.

38
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,733
- Mother.
- Oh, hello, dear.

39
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,755
I spend all of my time
trying to keep you

40
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,436
from turning my own daughters
against me.

41
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,032
Now you're gonna corrupt
all the children in the neighborhood.

42
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,012
Mom, we're not turning against you.

43
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,247
My dear, if you want to reject your
heritage, that's your business,

44
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,349
but someone has to take my place
as head of the Cromwell line,

45
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,884
and I know Marnie is just the stuff.

46
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,158
Or me.
I'd be good, too.

47
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,632
- That's right. That's right.
- All right, dress-up's over.

48
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,365
We've got bobbing for apples
right over there.

49
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,235
- (children groaning)
- Oh, yes, it's fun. It's fun. Go play.

50
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,298
Well, I hope you're happy.

51
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,276
Oh, ecstatic.

52
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,541
I'll take Grandma.

53
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,122
(woman) Hey. Gort. Are you home?

54
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,559
- (gruff voice) What do you want?
- Hi. Gort.

55
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,998
I'm asking everyone for a small donation
for the Halloweentown school.

56
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,694
Forget it. Astrid.

57
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,827
I don't give to charity.

58
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,601
Astrid, you're forever the optimist.

59
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,665
That's Gort, right?

60
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,109
He's the one who steals the socks?

61
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,273
Oh, he doesn't steal them.

62
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,284
He's more like a junk magnet.

63
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,412
Everything in the
universe that gets lost...

64
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,720
that other sock,
the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle,

65
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,353
the earring you put down
for just a second...

66
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,422
they all end up in Gort's front yard.

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,527
Not that he's willing
to part with any of it.

68
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,266
(jingling sound)

69
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,900
(Sophie) Oh, look, there's Benny.

70
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,037
Why don't you go back to Halloweentown
tonight while the portal's open?

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,709
I know you miss Astrid and Benny
and all your friends there.

72
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,775
(chuckles)

73
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:53,591
After a year away,
going back for just a few hours...

74
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,823
is harder than not going back at all.

75
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,093
No, I'll just wait till next Halloween,

76
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,657
and then I can take Marnie for the year.

77
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,762
But won't a year in Halloweentown
feel like 100 years to her?

78
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,937
Oh, becoming the head of the Cromwell
witches takes commitment, Sophie.

79
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,912
She can't live in both worlds.

80
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,949
She has to choose.

81
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,951
Ohh, look, look, look.
There's Luke.

82
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,113
Oh, he's becoming a fine young goblin,
hasn't he?

83
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,680
Look, look. H...

84
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,190
- What's the matter, dear?
- Somebody's coming.

85
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,728
Who?

86
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,099
I don't know.

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,162
- Come on.
- Well, I... I...

88
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,504
Do you think it could be someone...
I didn't invite anyo...

89
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,703
Come on, Grandma. Hide.

90
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,213
And do the thingy with your door.

91
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,750
It's not supposed to be there
when we have guests.

92
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,116
Ohh, your mother's rules.

93
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,050
- Mom.
- What?

94
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,291
I... I'm not turning against you.

95
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,326
I love you.

96
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,666
But I'm a witch.
I can't just not be.

97
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,933
I'm sorry that I got mad at you.

98
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,907
It's just so frustrating.

99
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,308
I want you to learn what I know, too.

100
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,973
Magic can give you
whatever you wish for,

101
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,814
but nothing's worth anything
if you can get it just by wishing.

102
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,083
- That's what your dad taught me.
- But I don't use magic for everything.

103
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,389
I don't use it on tests.

104
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,690
All right.
There was that one algebra test...

105
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,526
Marnie, you can't pick and choose.

106
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,398
If you go to Halloweentown for a year,
that's gonna become your life.

107
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,636
You're a stranger
in this world after that.

108
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,036
Knock, knock.

109
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,934
The bomb.

110
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,502
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

111
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,377
Dad, I found 'em.

112
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,187
Hi, I'm Alex.
This is my son Cal.

113
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,487
We just moved in down the street,
and we heard about your party.

114
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,874
Oh, well, welcome to
the neighborhood. I'm

115
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,189
Gwen, and this is my daughter Marnie.

116
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,663
Hi.

117
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,799
If all witches were as pretty as you,
they'd have a better reputation.

118
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,504
Oh. Thanks.

119
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,974
Can I put those in the freezer for you?

120
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,444
Whatever you want.
They're for you. Uh, for the party.

121
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,346
I hope you like lime.
Green's my favorite color.

122
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,747
OK.

123
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,415
Is the rest of your family coming, too?

124
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,752
Oh, it's just me and Cal.

125
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,487
Oh. Well, lime is good.

126
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,759
- Good.
- I've got some scoops over here.

127
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,958
(Alex) Let me help you.

128
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,126
(whispers) Rrarr!

129
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,296
That's Cindy.

130
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,168
Yeah.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,734
Well, it's a little crowded in here.
You wanna give me a tour?

132
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,336
Sure.
Let's go this way.

133
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,879
This is it.

134
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:12,220
- So, um, when did you move in?
- Just tonight, actually.

135
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,990
Really? And your dad let you come
to our party? Don't you have to unpack?

136
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,463
No. My dad doesn't waste his breath
on stuff like that.

137
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,365
He lets me figure it out myself.

138
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,834
Uh, so has anyone
asked you to go with them

139
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,537
to the costume party at the high school?

140
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,479
Why?
Did you want to ask me?

141
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,644
Well, that depends on whether or not
that would be ridiculous.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,621
Dylan, you're not even
wearing a costume.

143
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,455
Oh. Well, I'm not really into
the whole Halloween thing.

144
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,792
But that's the whole point of the party.

145
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,026
Most disgusting costume wins a prize
after the unmasking at midnight.

146
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,467
- Might that prize be a kiss?
- That's disgusting.

147
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,267
(laughs)

148
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,800
(Marnie) When we moved in last year,
I finally got my own room.

149
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,438
- Huh.
- What?

150
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,211
Oh, I don't know. It's just,
usually people's rooms look like 'em.

151
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,913
Yours doesn't.

152
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,887
What do you mean?

153
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,790
Well, you strike me as unconventional,
but in a good way.

154
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,625
Yeah, well, my room is kind of ordinary.

155
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,135
My mom likes ordinary, I guess.

156
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,193
Oh, she's the boss, huh?

157
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,809
Well, there is my grandma's room.

158
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,437
Why?
What's hers like?

159
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,507
I'll show you.

160
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,016
Was that there before?

161
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,157
Shh.

162
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,491
This is a secret.

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,504
Wow.

164
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,301
This is so cool.

165
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,934
Does she do it like
this every Halloween?

166
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,843
She's very into the whole witch thing.

167
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,405
Um, stories, I mean, about witches.

168
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,883
(Cal) Yeah, I guess so.

169
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,217
"Hair of werewolf."

170
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,383
- This must not be easy to get.
- It wasn't, believe m...

171
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,953
Um, I mean, in the old
days of fairy tales.

172
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,224
Oh. So you know about
this witch stuff, too.

173
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,963
- A little.
- Do you know any magic spells?

174
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,473
Well, sure,
but they're pretend ones, of course.

175
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,873
See, there are common spells
that every witch knows...

176
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,572
I mean, supposedly...

177
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,013
and then there are the
really secret ones

178
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,880
that are only known
to the witch who made them up.

179
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,420
Or warlock.

180
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,548
That's what male witches
are called, right? Warlocks?

181
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,252
So you've been doing some reading, too.

182
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,694
Just movies and stuff,
but they're not really that educational.

183
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,291
Well, Grandma feels like
witches are misunderstood,

184
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,803
so she likes to teach us about them.

185
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,798
Whoa. Is that supposed
to be a book of spells?

186
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,603
No.

187
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,572
I mean...

188
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:25,447
yes, that's what it's supposed to be.
But you can't touch it.

189
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,918
Oh, come on.
It's just pretend, right?

190
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,479
Well, sure, but it's still
my grandma's stuff,

191
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,857
and we really shouldn't be in here
when she's not here, so I...

192
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,589
OK.

193
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,995
- So, you like ice cream?
- Sure.

194
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,232
All right.

195
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,594
- Oh, thanks.
- Do you want some, son?

196
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,493
Actually,
I think I'm gonna head home, Dad.

197
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,591
I think I'll stay around here
and help out... If that's OK.

198
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,761
Oh, I never turn down help.

199
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,329
Hey, Marnie, I'm not enrolled yet,

200
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,570
but I hear there's this really big
costume party at the high school.

201
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:29,205
I figured if my costume's good enough,
maybe I could crash it.

202
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,717
Well, let's see. If you went
with a student who is enrolled,

203
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,618
then maybe you wouldn't
have to crash it.

204
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,781
Pick you up in an hour?

205
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,325
Yeah, sure.

206
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,019
(whispers) Yes!

207
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,161
Meeting you is everything
I hoped it would be.

208
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,536
I don't see anyone.

209
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,213
(reciting spell)

210
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,769
- And one for you.
- Ooh.

211
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,172
And one for you, and...

212
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,178
Where's mine?

213
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,447
It's empty.

214
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,247
Well, dear, it's always empty.

215
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,982
That's why it's magic
when we pull things out of it.

216
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,355
Grandma, there's nothing in there,
not even by magic.

217
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,519
Well, that's impossible.

218
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,297
Oh. Oh, well, I'm sorry, kids.

219
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,303
I guess... I guess that is all there is.

220
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,238
Just my luck.

221
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:07,508
Well, I can't...
I've had this for centuries.

222
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,572
It's never been empty before.

223
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,140
- Empty?
- Well, it's no wonder.

224
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:17,053
Every day for two years, pulling
out bat games, dancing skeletons,

225
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,989
enchanted toads,
back issues of Magic Monthly...

226
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,085
And, hey, let's not forget the ogre
with the flatulence problem.

227
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,892
Stinky.
I miss him.

228
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:31,532
It just can't run out. It's connected
to my house back in Halloweentown

229
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,040
with all my charms and all my spells.

230
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:39,339
Oh, perhaps I should just
pop back up to Halloweentown,

231
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,572
just... just to look at my house.

232
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,046
Can I go?
Can I go?

233
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,242
Oh, forget it, Sophie.

234
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,285
Mom already put the big foot down.

235
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,752
None of us can go.

236
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:54,350
Well, perhaps if I said that I need
your help with a technical problem.

237
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,553
I'll get my coat.

238
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,320
This'll never work.

239
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,593
Oh, no, let me do the talking, dear.

240
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,864
I'll use my utmost powers of persuasion.

241
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,303
(chuckles)

242
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,500
It'll work.

243
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,635
And here I thought we were going
to avoid the annual family meltdown.

244
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,201
Ha.

245
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,949
...what we're made of,
do you know what I mean?

246
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,211
I do. Just the other day...

247
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,982
Honey, I'm taking the girls out
for a little while. Is that all right?

248
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,989
Sure, Mom.
Just make sure...

249
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,821
Wait.
Out where?

250
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,123
Oh, just home.
We'll be back in a jiffy.

251
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,268
Oh, how do you do?
I'm Aggie, Gwen's mother.

252
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,495
Nice to meet you.

253
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,934
- I'm Alex.
- Mother...

254
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,337
Marnie's going to be staying with me
for a whole year

255
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,638
after she gets out of high school.

256
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,371
Isn't that fabulous?

257
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,776
How lucky for her.

258
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,577
Yes, and Sophie is
going to stay with me.

259
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,878
Mom!

260
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:59,221
Sweetheart, it's your bedtime. Why don't
you go upstairs and start getting ready?

261
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,958
We'll be back soon, Mom.

262
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,589
Don't worry.

263
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,928
OK?

264
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,968
You see?
Your mother can be reasonable.

265
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,635
We should have a stranger there
for all our family discussions.

266
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:24,240
If she wants to check on us, you tell
her to call me on my head phone.

267
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,409
You mean cell phone.

268
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,350
- Head phone.
- Ew!

269
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,887
What good are those things?

270
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,515
Well, they're a little bit
like your walkie-talkies...

271
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,616
(whispers) Except they work like magic.

272
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,493
(Aggie's voice)
Except they work like magic.

273
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:37,690
Ohh!

274
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,095
They can even be used to communicate

275
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,258
between the mortal world
and Halloweentown.

276
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,495
I invented them myself.

277
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,801
Aren't they cute?
Anyway, it probably won't be a problem,

278
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,671
because you know we're gonna
be home before midnight.

279
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,008
We'll be back in an hour,
because I have a date.

280
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,516
And I've never understood
why you bother with that Internet thing

281
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,989
when my witch's glass can show you
anything you want to know.

282
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:11,822
Wait. Isn't this where
the bus stop's supposed to be?

283
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:16,095
Oh, yes. Oh, Arnold must have forgot
to put the thing out again.

284
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:21,663
I swear, that man would lose his head if
his wife didn't put it in his lunchbox.

285
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,109
(laughs) Well... I'll summon the bus.

286
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,169
- Good.
- Ahem.

287
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,708
Gestum ex alius mundus

288
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,687
nos te appello ut adduco domus!

289
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,620
- Didn't I say it right?
- Try it again with more feeling.

290
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,390
OK. Ahem.

291
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,058
Gestum ex alius mundus

292
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,001
nos te appello ut adduco domus!

293
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:58,565
Well, I guess we'll just have to
call up the portal ourselves.

294
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,977
(both) From the mortal world
depart we now,

295
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,847
on this, the night, All Hallow's Eve,

296
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,511
back into Halloweentown.

297
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:12,114
Through the portal we take our leave.

298
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,493
Four hours till midnight.

299
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,588
We'll be back in plenty of time.

300
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,044
Has anyone ever told you
you have the most beautiful green eyes?

301
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,682
They're like two lily pads
floating on a crystal-clear lake.

302
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,950
Look, I don't want to be too forward,

303
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,687
but would you consider being my date
for the costume party?

304
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,195
- At the high school?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,255
That's just for the students.

306
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,427
Oh, I'm sure they can
always use more chaperones.

307
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,337
Hey, it'll give me an excuse
to see you again.

308
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,738
Well, I don't even have a costume.

309
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,449
Oh, that's all right. Cal's got
loads of stuff back at the house.

310
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,174
I'm sure we can find you something.

311
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,785
All right. Sure.
I'd like that.

312
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,479
Great.

313
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,250
Well... till then.

314
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,624
Till then.

315
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,260
I was just curious.

316
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,859
- Thanks for stopping by.
- (Croaks)

317
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,939
(croaking)

318
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,305
Same to you.

319
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,777
(croaking)

320
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,015
Oh, it feels so good to be back.

321
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,355
Sophie was right.

322
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,557
I needed to come home.
I've been missing my friends terribly.

323
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,268
Where's the big jack-o'-lantern?

324
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,339
Is this some kind of joke?

325
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,743
(Aggie) As goes the jack-o'-lantern,
so goes Halloweentown.

326
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,014
Grandma, what's happened?

327
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,085
Everything's kind of gray and boring.

328
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,594
Not just everything.
Everybody.

329
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,356
Wait, please.

330
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,330
Could you tell me what's happening here?

331
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,525
I would just like...

332
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,729
Astrid, is that you?

333
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,204
I'm Astrid.

334
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,367
Astrid, what's happened to you?

335
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,308
What do you mean?

336
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:51,281
Well, I mean, you're turning gray
and your bell-bottoms are gone.

337
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,581
And your shoes. Ooh!

338
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,812
These are very comfortable.

339
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,324
Sensible shoes are important.

340
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,327
I think I'll buy some more.

341
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,761
Ohh, Astrid.

342
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,890
Oh, excuse me.

343
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,932
I was talking.

344
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,299
Whatever.

345
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,032
Oh, I hate that word.

346
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,267
Wait a minute.

347
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,899
Dear...

348
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,601
Do I know you?

349
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,638
Duh.

350
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,842
It can't be. Luke?

351
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,882
Yeah.

352
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,185
But you look just like you did
when Kalabar put that spell on you

353
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,657
and turned you human.

354
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,489
Whatever.

355
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,087
Would you stop that?

356
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,326
Look, what is going on?

357
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,269
- Why are you turning gray?
- Everybody's doing it.

358
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:50,035
- That's not what I mean.
- It's the spell, dear.

359
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:54,841
A spell? You think someone
put a spell on all of Halloweentown?

360
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,849
- How could they do that?
- I'm not sure.

361
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:05,152
But the spell seems to be turning
the creatures not only gray,

362
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:09,421
but once it progresses far enough,
into humans.

363
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,691
Come on, Grandma.
Humans aren't this boring.

364
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,392
No.

365
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:20,734
I should say this is the caricature
of humans in Halloweentown,

366
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:25,743
just as humans make fun of us
from the mortal world at Halloween.

367
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,343
But who would cast a spell like this?

368
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,942
I don't know,
but someone is destroying my home.

369
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,921
OK, let's not get upset.

370
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,719
Undoing spells isn't that hard, right?

371
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,692
You just say 'em backwards.

372
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,130
I remember... I remember something
from my spell book. It was a spell...

373
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,794
Well, I haven't looked at it in years,

374
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,632
but it was similar to this.

375
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,037
Well, great. Then maybe
the spell in your book can cure it.

376
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,735
It's worth a try.

377
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,046
Dylan? Dylan?
Oh, Dylan.

378
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,241
Are you there?
Can you hear me?

379
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,183
Dylan, will you please answer this?

380
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,379
Dylan. Can you hear me?

381
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,581
Dylan. Are you there?

382
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,250
Dylan. Will you please answer me?

383
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,966
All right, I hear you.
What do you want?

384
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:20,661
I want you to go into my room
and read me a spell out of my book.

385
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,029
Grandma, I'm busy.

386
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,091
Oh! Oh...

387
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,296
Just do it, Dylan,

388
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,737
or I'll spam your diary
all over the Net.

389
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,172
You don't know my password.

390
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,972
Wanna bet, Iron Buns?

391
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,409
Shh. OK, I'll do it.

392
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,582
(chuckles) Iron Buns.

393
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,651
I should have been allowed to go, too.

394
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,282
Yeah.
Just open the door.

395
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,091
We're in.

396
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,229
Oh!

397
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,265
Gotcha.

398
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,579
Look, just find the
spell book, all right?

399
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,826
It's not here.

400
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,737
What do you mean. It's not there?
It should be on the table.

401
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,002
- Well, it's not.
- It has to be.

402
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,508
Maybe Grandma misplaced it.

403
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,877
Dylan, it's huge.
How's she gonna "misplace" it?

404
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:14,510
- She misplaced the ogre.
- Stinky liked playing hide and seek.

405
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,011
Someone must have taken it.

406
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,615
Did any of you go to my room
since I came down to the party?

407
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,785
- Not me.
- Not me.

408
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:29,931
Um, well, I was, for a few minutes.

409
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,030
Well, did someone go in with you?

410
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,572
Just this boy I met - Cal...

411
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,609
but he couldn't have taken it,
'cause I was with him the whole time.

412
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,611
He must be the one I felt coming.

413
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,271
He stole it, Grandma.

414
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,395
It could have been somebody else.
I mean,

415
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:46,443
we've been gone for almost an hour.

416
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,282
Well, only you, Grandma and Sophie
know the spell to get in.

417
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,251
Children, you seal my room.

418
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,556
I'm going to go back and have a talk
with Marnie's new friend.

419
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,702
He wouldn't steal anything, Grandma.
He's really sweet.

420
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,870
Perhaps, but for the moment,
he's our only suspect.

421
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,004
Mm.

422
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,277
(both)
From Halloweentown depart we now,

423
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,720
on this, the night, All Hallow's Eve,

424
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,257
back into the mortal world.

425
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,520
Through the portal we take our leave.

426
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,959
The... the portal won't open.

427
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,797
Oh, it's just as I feared.

428
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,430
Whoever cast this Gray Spell
knew it would affect my suitcase

429
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,373
and knew we'd come to investigate.
It was a trap.

430
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:48,879
(Cal) Very good, Aggie.
You're keeping up nicely.

431
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,414
Cal?

432
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,279
Over here.

433
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,113
Cal?
You cast the spell on Halloweentown?

434
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:05,129
Just the way it was written in Aggie's
little spell book. You naughty girl.

435
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,165
I knew it seemed familiar.

436
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,701
But... But then you'd have to be a w...

437
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,602
A warlock?
Sweet, huh?

438
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,368
So then that whole thing...

439
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,409
your so-called dad,

440
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:22,913
the tour of the house -
it was just to get the book.

441
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,848
No, I could have stolen
the book anytime.

442
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:31,321
See, I wanted you to show it to me
because you felt something between us,

443
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,119
and you did.

444
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:38,253
- You tricked me.
- Ha. You'll get over it.

445
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,390
And, hey, I still need a date
to the costume party.

446
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,331
Forget the party.

447
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,665
I wanna know why...

448
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,640
- Kalabar.
- What did you say, dear?

449
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,110
The rose.

450
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,045
You always did let
your magic do the talking.

451
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,022
I should have known
when he gave me the rose.

452
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,161
Cal.

453
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,992
You're Kalabar's son.

454
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:17,797
And I guess I inherited my father's
attraction to Cromwell witches.

455
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,394
I didn't know Kalabar had a child.

456
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,270
He didn't want people to know.

457
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,744
Dad and I didn't always agree, but he
was the only one that stood in the way

458
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,043
of the Cromwells' domination
of Halloweentown.

459
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:35,018
Oh, that's absurd.
The Cromwells dominate no one.

460
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,987
Then why'd you let the mortals
take charge of the earth

461
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:41,219
while we had to hide like rats
in another dimension?

462
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:47,094
Oh, we all voted to create our own world
so everyone could live in peace.

463
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,464
And when my father tried to bring
the creatures of Halloweentown

464
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,504
back as rulers of the human race,

465
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,563
you Cromwells
brought everyone against him,

466
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,666
and then you destroyed him!

467
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:02,372
So that's what this is about - revenge.

468
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:06,281
Just say the word,
and I'll open up the portal.

469
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,216
Say what word?

470
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,722
Stop doing everything
your mama tells you,

471
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:17,387
and I can show you things that Aggie
could not teach you in a million years.

472
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,986
Ha!

473
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,727
I'm not interested in
your kind of magic.

474
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,496
All you do is destroy.

475
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,903
Oh, the Gray Spell
is just the first act, Marnie.

476
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,932
The finale will come at midnight
in the mortal world.

477
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,845
- What finale?
- Join me and find out.

478
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,906
No way.

479
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,612
Well, you think about it, and, uh...

480
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,512
Catch ya later.

481
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,031
I'm sorry, Grandma.

482
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,090
I really blew it.

483
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,330
We all make mistakes, dear,
but don't worry about it.

484
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,773
We'll show Cal the Cromwells
are not so easily beaten.

485
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,241
But how?

486
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,871
I mean, we're trapped here,
and... he's got your spell book.

487
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:13,384
Well, I still have a few
tricks up my sleeve.

488
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,852
(whistles)
First we have to get back to my house.

489
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:21,221
Oh, thank goodness.
The taxicab is still working.

490
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:26,320
Oh, now, on the way, you can call
your brother and give him an update

491
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:31,357
while we find a way
to break this accursed spell.

492
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,370
- Hmm?
- OK.

493
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,870
- Benny?
- Wow! Ahh...

494
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,938
Need a ride?

495
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,383
Uh, Grandma, I think it's Benny.

496
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,880
(Marnie) Can you drive
any faster, Benny?

497
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,653
(Aggie) Relax, Marnie.
We've arrived.

498
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,993
Wow. Turning gray sure has made you
a careful driver, Benny.

499
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,495
- Have we met?
- Ohh...

500
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,161
Well, yeah, but the last time,

501
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:09,172
you were just skin and bones,
except for the skin.

502
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,505
Thank you for the ride, dear.
We're in something of a hurry.

503
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,612
Come on, children, let's get inside.

504
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,514
What do you think
Cal's going to do to the mortal world?

505
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,042
Well, he clearly shares
his father's hatred of humans,

506
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,681
but if he's willing
to break the Code of Merlin,

507
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,693
which forbids stealing
the spells of another,

508
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,924
then I think that we can safely assume
that he's capable of anything.

509
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,522
Now no more talk until we're inside,

510
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,435
and even if he's still eavesdropping,
he won't be able to hear us in my house.

511
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,825
I hope the Gray Spell
hasn't changed an...

512
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,640
(gasp)... anything. Ohh.

513
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,249
I like what you've done with the place.

514
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,619
I can't believe Cal did this
with a spell out of your book.

515
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,282
We'll never undo it.

516
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,155
Oh, I'd agree with you, dear,

517
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,424
if there was only one copy
of my spell book.

518
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,727
But what he doesn't
know is there are two.

519
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,691
Two?

520
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,601
They're matched sets,
two complete copies.

521
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,799
I took the one I usually use
to the mortal world with me,

522
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,742
and the other one is still here.

523
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,476
Someplace.

524
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,176
- Well, then, let's look for it.
- Oh, let's. Let's.

525
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,091
- (high-pitched voice) OK, yes.
- (High-pitched voice) Is it in there?

526
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:29,972
No. Excuse me. Excu...

527
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,617
OK. Uh, no...

528
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,625
OK, maybe...
Oh, this is it. No. Aah!

529
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,322
(normal voice)
You can help out, you know.

530
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,628
- I'm kinda hungry.
- Ohh!

531
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,191
I wonder if there's anything
to eat around here.

532
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,703
(both. High-pitched voices) Oh!

533
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,001
Maybe it's in here.
Maybe it's in here.

534
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,405
It's gotta be here.
I know it is.

535
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,570
(normal voice) It's not here.

536
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,772
(sighs)

537
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,783
- How about that one?
- No, that's not it. That's too small.

538
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,331
- How about this? This?
- It's just a big... it's a big book.

539
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,378
- No. OK.
- Oh, my goodness.

540
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,322
Then some of these.
Here, here. I know. Here. This is it.

541
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,690
We can't find it.

542
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,661
Grandma, we can't just give up.

543
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,009
There's gotta be something
we haven't thought of, right?

544
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,633
I mean, something to get us out
of this trap, a spell or...

545
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,331
(whooshing sound)

546
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,967
- Luke!
- Yeah.

547
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,034
Look!
You're a goblin again.

548
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,942
Something broke the spell.

549
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,742
I guess so.

550
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:34,410
Well, what happened, Grandma?
Did you say something?

551
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:38,046
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Then how come I'm not gray anymore?

552
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,819
Hmm. I suppose the spell
could be temporary.

553
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:46,125
Then maybe the spell
on the house will wear off,

554
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,630
and we can find your spell book.

555
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,634
But if takes too long, midnight
will pass, and the mortal world...

556
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,502
Grandma, you already said the spell book
isn't here. What else can we do?

557
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,803
Well, I haven't seen
that other spell book for decades.

558
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,539
Perhaps it's lost.

559
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:07,106
Grandma, why are you smiling?
That's terrible.

560
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:11,144
No, no, dear, not at all,
because, you see, if it's lost,

561
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,555
I know just where it is.

562
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,116
- Wait. Gimme that again?
- (Chuckles)

563
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:22,098
Everything that's lost in both worlds
always ends up at Gort's house.

564
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,191
He's the junk man of the universe.

565
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,929
Ohh! Excuse me.

566
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,938
(engine running)

567
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,843
- Your receipt.
- Mail it, dear.

568
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,277
Great, Benny.
OK, now to Gort's house, and step on it.

569
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,160
You should see him
when he's not in a hurry.

570
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:59,965
Good night.
Thank you so much for coming. Bye.

571
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,334
- (woman) Thanks very much.
- (Girl) Bye.

572
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,376
Did Grandma ever consider that
she might have misplaced the book?

573
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,138
I tried that.

574
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,211
Your grandmother thinks
everything's about magic.

575
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,772
If she keeps this up, you kids are never
gonna grow up to be normal people.

576
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,614
Grandma says being normal
is vastly overrated.

577
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,551
And you should already be in bed.

578
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,648
Marnie swears this kid Cal
is a warlock and that he stole it,

579
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,956
- and about his dad...
- All right, that's enough.

580
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,896
OK, I think that it would be
a good idea if everyone around here

581
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,729
started coming up with
simple explanations for things

582
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,965
before they summoned up
the powers of darkness

583
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,506
every time they're trying
to find their car keys.

584
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,771
Now, Cal seems like a very
sweet and charming young man

585
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,607
and his father seems li...

586
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,443
(gasp) Alex.

587
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:48,110
Hey, Gwen.
Great costume, huh?

588
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,280
- Hope I didn't scare you.
- Well, it is Halloween.

589
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,451
And, to celebrate,
Cal and I found a terrific mask for you.

590
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,687
Woo-ooo.

591
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,457
Ew.

592
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,998
Oh, it's...

593
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,591
You don't like it.

594
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,035
Oh, no.
It's... It's great.

595
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,131
We are gonna be the hit
of the costume party.

596
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,177
Oh, wait.
You're going to the Halloween party?

597
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,805
Yes. Alex invited me, and...

598
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,940
Oh, Sophie.

599
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,506
I get to go, too?

600
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,465
Oh, no, sweetie.
You should already be in bed.

601
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,647
Oh, Alex, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't even thinking.

602
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,556
Oh. Well, that's OK.

603
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,787
It's no big deal.

604
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,088
You guys go.

605
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,929
I'll baby-sit Sophie.

606
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,492
Dylan, no. You've been
looking forward to this for weeks.

607
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,095
Let's face it, Mom.
I'm just not that into Halloween.

608
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,392
I mean, I was hoping
for a little social interaction,

609
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,993
but you're the one
that's got the date.

610
00:35:45,994 --> 00:35:47,443
Did you ask Tiffany?

611
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,070
- She was busy.
- Samantha?

612
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,774
- Boyfriend.
- Julia?

613
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:55,114
She laughed so hard
that milk came out of her nose.

614
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,177
You guys go.
You can make it up to me later.

615
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,383
- Are you sure?
- That is wonderful.

616
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,824
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

617
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,460
You're not gonna give
me warts, are you?

618
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:08,025
That is a complete myth.

619
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,263
- Bed.
- Don't make me laugh.

620
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,465
Where'd all the junk go?

621
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,636
Looks like Gort's been straightening up
ever since the Gray Spell hit.

622
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,202
Oh, you'd still better
prepare yourself, my dear.

623
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,375
Spell or no spell, Gort the Rancorous

624
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,614
is still the foulest, meanest, smelliest
inhabitant of Halloweentown.

625
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,785
Yes?

626
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,058
Hello, Gort.
You're looking... clean.

627
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,725
Um, do you need something?

628
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,998
I'm busy, you see, sorting my socks.

629
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,165
Uh, yes, Mr. Gort, sir.

630
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,141
We were looking for a book.

631
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,735
Oh, I see.

632
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,643
Well, come right in.

633
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,115
I have several books.

634
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,742
Yes.

635
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,022
(Gort) Well, here they are.

636
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:17,329
Oh, thank you, Gort.
"Proper Toenail Cutting."

637
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,393
"Dusting for Fun and Profit"?

638
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,463
"100 Recipes for Tapioca."

639
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,476
You know, I don't think
whoever lost these is missing 'em much.

640
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,944
Gort, these can't be
all the books you've got.

641
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:34,315
Well, I sold the rest at the yard sale.

642
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,545
Yard sale?

643
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,021
Oh, yes.
This place was very messy.

644
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,888
I only kept the useful books.

645
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:46,896
I'll sell these socks, too,
as soon as I match them up.

646
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:52,027
Gort, there was a particular book,
an extra copy of my spell book.

647
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,367
Do you remember who you sold it to?

648
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,445
Do you think these two match?

649
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,381
No, I suppose not.

650
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,945
Well, we've hit a dead end.

651
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,857
You know, that book could be anywhere.

652
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:19,327
OK, I say we head back
to the mortal world.

653
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:23,163
- The spell - it's coming back.
- Ohh.

654
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,328
Grandma, wh... what's happening?

655
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,395
It's the Gray Spell.

656
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,930
It's affecting me
now that we're in Halloweentown.

657
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,204
It's probably gonna go
after you, too, dear.

658
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,712
We've gotta get out of here.

659
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,946
The door - it won't open.

660
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,617
(Marnie) What?
There are no windows, either.

661
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,255
Grandma, you gotta do something.

662
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,457
Oh, dear.
Oh, I can't.

663
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:58,093
The Gray Spell must be
draining our powers.

664
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,069
(Cal) Right again, Agatha.

665
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,603
(laughs) You see, at
this point, I could

666
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:05,901
keep you people in
here with a toothpick.

667
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,773
Grandma was right.

668
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,439
You've been spying on
us this whole time.

669
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,712
Oh, I didn't need to. You see, I already
knew about Aggie's little spell book.

670
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,548
That's why I knew you'd
end up at Gort's.

671
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,020
How could you?

672
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,355
I lost that book before you were born.

673
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,953
So, Marnie, have you thought any more
about going to the party?

674
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,796
I mean, everyone's gonna be there,
even your mom.

675
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,462
My mom?
You're lying.

676
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,562
My mom hates Halloween.

677
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,164
Oh, I think my dad got
her into the spirit.

678
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,002
He's not really my dad, actually.
He's more of a science experiment.

679
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,114
But he got her into a really ugly mask.
It's a scream.

680
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,548
You know, this is not the way
to talk me into a date.

681
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:51,384
This is more than a date.
This is our future together.

682
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:56,688
I'm in control of my own future,
and it doesn't include you.

683
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,659
Creature Spell.

684
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,031
- What?
- That's a spell in my book.

685
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:09,436
It's a spell that was banned
after the dark times.

686
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:16,174
It was used on humans who mocked us
by dressing up like creatures.

687
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:23,119
It was used on them to turn them into
the very creatures they were mocking.

688
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,554
He turned the creatures into humans,

689
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,092
and now he's gonna
turn the humans into creatures.

690
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,425
That's why Cal put
your mother in a mask.

691
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:37,900
I think he plans to use the Creature
Spell on the mortal world at midnight.

692
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,605
Dylan.

693
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,819
Do you want me
to read you a bedtime story?

694
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,184
No. Listen.

695
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,052
"Golems are very pleasant creatures

696
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,355
"built entirely from mud
or other natural elements.

697
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,295
They have no will of their own and do
whatever their creators tell them."

698
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,855
Good. Be a golem.
Go to bed.

699
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,335
You said you saw a frog on the floor
just after Cal's dad left.

700
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,100
And then, later, he shows up
in a giant frog costume?

701
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:19,870
What is this,
some sort of Biblical plague thing?

702
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,311
Sophie, Mom hasn't gone out
with anyone in two years.

703
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,109
I'm not going to that
party just to tell

704
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,838
her that you think her
date is a reptile.

705
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,942
Frogs are amphibians.

706
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,384
I'm not going.

707
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:34,117
Somebody's gotta be here to water
the plants when they take you all away.

708
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,785
Dylan, I can't do this by myself.

709
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,557
Whether you like it or not,
you're a Cromwell, too,

710
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,190
and that means
you feel things just like we do.

711
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,598
Tell me you don't feel
like something's wrong.

712
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,800
OK, maybe we'll go for a minute,

713
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,172
but just to prove to you
that nothing is wrong.

714
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,711
You'll need a costume.

715
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,650
No way.

716
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:08,854
OK... he's keeping us
in here with a spell,

717
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,885
so maybe we can come up
with a stronger one.

718
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:17,866
Oh, our powers are draining, dear.
I'm afraid we're trapped.

719
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:23,270
But, Grandma, saying a spell backwards
can't be the only way to undo it.

720
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,831
Oh, rules are rules.

721
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,609
But rules... rules have
exceptions, right?

722
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,876
I mean...

723
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,011
like... like how hackers
get into computer programs.

724
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,147
They just look for the back door.

725
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,953
Computers have back doors?

726
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:46,224
Well, back doors are ways of getting
into a program if there's a problem.

727
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,761
I wonder if spells have back doors.

728
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:56,898
So you mean a way to weasel out of
the spell without actually breaking it.

729
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,408
Right.
Like this spell.

730
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,411
It's supposed to keep us
from getting outside, right?

731
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,073
Yeah. So?

732
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:09,609
So what if we tried to go somewhere else
other than outside?

733
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,212
There is nowhere else.
There's only outside and inside,

734
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,985
and right now, we're inside.

735
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,586
Time travel. Oh, Grandma,
you have a spell for that, right?

736
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,892
Grandma,
do you have a spell for time travel?

737
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,661
- Time-travel spell.
- Yeah.

738
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,760
Oh, I believe I do.

739
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,964
A lovely little poem.

740
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,237
Gort... Gort...
That sock doesn't match the other one.

741
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,007
Grandma, Grandma,
none of them match. Focus.

742
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,676
Come on. Ooh, I know. Here, here.
You write it down, write, write.

743
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,948
- What is it? What...? Just a minute.
- Give me that.

744
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,548
- Write it down before you forget it.
- Spell, spell. Oh...

745
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,956
Hurry, Grandma.

746
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,960
There.

747
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:54,191
It's a little fuzzy...
fuzzy there, but...

748
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,324
There, that's it.
That's it, that's it.

749
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,802
Grandma!

750
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,237
Can you read that?

751
00:44:02,238 --> 00:44:03,958
I don't know, but here,
let's help her up.

752
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,374
Oh...

753
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,839
Gort, there are no matching socks here.

754
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,583
Yes, well, uh,
I have some more in the cupboard.

755
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,656
Well, go get them.

756
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,488
No. Grandma, read this spell with me.

757
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,858
No, go away.
We're busy.

758
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,762
- She's gone.
- But, Grandma, it's me - Marnie.

759
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,801
- Here we go.
- Grandma...

760
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,396
Oh, finally we can
get something accomplished.

761
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,872
Matching, matching.
You want the long one?

762
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,772
Look, we have to get out of here.

763
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,869
We can come back for her later.

764
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,072
OK.

765
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,580
(reading spell)

766
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,394
OK, I say we head back
to the mortal world.

767
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,131
The spell, it's coming back.

768
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,571
Grandma, what's happening?

769
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,304
It's the Gray Spell.
It's affecting me...

770
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,972
This is only five minutes ago.

771
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,538
Must not have said it right.

772
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:24,213
(reading spell)

773
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,992
- Aah.
- Whoa.

774
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,257
(grunts)

775
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,129
OK, I overshot just a little bit.

776
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,032
(reading spell)

777
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,966
(Marnie screams)

778
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,815
Luke?
Grandma?

779
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,758
Nice job of escaping my spell.

780
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,920
You have real potential, Marnie.

781
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,833
Where's Luke and Grandma?
And what time is it?

782
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:15,770
They're... Well, I guess you could say
I took 'em offline for the moment.

783
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,159
It's a simple limbo spell.
I could teach it to you later.

784
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,407
You better stop
breaking in on my spells, Cal.

785
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:24,936
It's against the Code of Merlin.

786
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,813
Nobody cares about
the Code of Merlin anymore, Marnie.

787
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,911
You need an update. And besides,
what do you wanna hang around

788
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,855
a bunch of moldy
old creatures for, anyway?

789
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,586
These creatures are my friends.

790
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,060
Your mom's about to become
a really moldy old creature.

791
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,994
Leave my mother alone.

792
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,259
Oh, yeah, that reminds me... Bye.

793
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,167
(reading spell)

794
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,298
Luke?

795
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,394
Luke? Luke, where...?

796
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:24,338
You know, I think I liked this place
better when it was gray.

797
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,137
Where is Gort?

798
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:30,112
It's almost 11:00 in the mortal world.
We've got to find him.

799
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,841
(door closes)

800
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,975
Oh, yeah, I think you found him.

801
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,545
What are you doing in my house?

802
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,057
Um, it's OK.
Aggie sent us.

803
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,531
Well, that doesn't
make you welcome here.

804
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,069
I hate Aggie!

805
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,764
Don't feel bad.
He hates everyone.

806
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,204
Um...

807
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:01,506
Well, Aggie has
the greatest respect for you.

808
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,548
She does?
Yeah.

809
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:13,523
She said that you were
the smelliest, foulest,

810
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,753
meanest inhabitant
in all of Halloweentown.

811
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,692
Marnie, ixnay.

812
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,423
She said that?

813
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,626
Ehh...

814
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,793
She's just trying to butter me up.

815
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,168
No, no, no.
She meant it, really.

816
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,039
That's very sweet of her,
and I hate it when people are sweet!

817
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,137
Now get out!
I have messing up to do.

818
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,614
No. No, but there's
something that we need.

819
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:44,620
Oh. Well, in that case, take a number.

820
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:49,819
- I'm now serving nobody!
- Uh, but...

821
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:54,762
Little girl, you stink like a Cromwell,

822
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,528
and I want you out of my cottage!

823
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,231
OK, OK.
Nice Gort.

824
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,138
(growls)

825
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:14,512
Well, um, it was nice seeing your place
while it was still messy.

826
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,553
Wait.

827
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:22,285
What do you mean, "still messy"?

828
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,352
There's this thing called the Gray
Spell, you see, and in a few years,

829
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,867
Kalabar's son is gonna make
your whole house neat.

830
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,061
What?!

831
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,431
Aah!

832
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,203
(screaming)

833
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,573
Slow down.

834
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,412
Watch out. Aah!

835
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,044
Are you sure Mom said this was OK?

836
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,146
No. Grandma hasn't
taught me how to fly yet.

837
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,192
- What?
- It's OK.

838
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,851
(laughs)

839
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,726
Yeow!

840
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,265
(screaming and moaning)

841
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,873
- (Luke) What does it look like?
- (Marnie) It's a big leather book.

842
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,291
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

843
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,850
I can't let this happen.

844
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:35,193
My beautiful dirt cleaned?

845
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:40,760
My wonderful junk
sold in a yard sale? Oh...

846
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:44,705
Don't you have some sort of,
I don't know, a filing system?

847
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,572
Of course I do.

848
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,942
I keep all my scabs under the porch.

849
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,411
- Ew!
- Ugh, I'm sorry I asked.

850
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,713
Aah!

851
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,981
Hey, Spike.

852
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,148
My boy, my boy.

853
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,054
Come to Papa.

854
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,387
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

855
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,622
Yes.

856
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,531
OK.

857
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,432
Go play, but you play nice.

858
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,130
Ohh.

859
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,605
I don't think the spell book is here.

860
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,733
We've looked everywhere.

861
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,677
Maybe we came too far
back in time, maybe

862
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:25,544
before she even lost the spell book.

863
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,049
Well, Grandma said
she hasn't seen it for decades.

864
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,847
We couldn't have come back that far.

865
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,380
Hey, is this book you're
looking for leather?

866
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,482
Yes.

867
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,960
With some kind of
fancy writing on the front?

868
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,894
Biblio Magica.
Yeah.

869
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,592
- I remember it.
- That's really good.

870
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:48,764
Kalabar bought it from me
about 50 years ago.

871
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,637
That's really bad.

872
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:57,044
Kalabar must've been working on
this world-domination thing for decades.

873
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:01,551
Well, then that means Cal must've had
Grandma's other spell book all along

874
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,519
with the Gray Spell in it.

875
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,318
And the only reason
he took it out of our house...

876
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,223
Was to stop you from undoing the spell.

877
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,488
Ugh.

878
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,324
I can't believe it.

879
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,958
We came all this way for nothing.

880
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,865
Ohh...

881
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,443
([music] dance)

882
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:39,219
- Nice landing, Sophie.
- Like you could do better.

883
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,298
I don't see Mom.

884
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,232
Oh, Cindy,
I found a great costume for the dance.

885
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:57,637
Yeah? Who are you
supposed to be - El Geeko?

886
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,282
There she is.

887
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,787
Mom. Hey, Mom.

888
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,414
Mommy.

889
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,016
Sophie? Dylan?

890
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,288
- What are you guys doing here?
- Um...

891
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,490
Well, we're just rocking to the beat.

892
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,740
We had to talk to you.

893
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,768
Talk to me? About what?
How did you get here?

894
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:44,014
Alex, would you excuse us
for just a minute?

895
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,784
- Sure. I'll get some punch.
- Great.

896
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,587
- You flew here?
- Not very well.

897
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,787
Why would you do something like that?

898
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,745
Sophie wants to talk
to you about Alex.

899
00:53:54,746 --> 00:53:56,628
Alex?

900
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,691
He's not really Cal's dad, Mom.

901
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,204
Oh, I see.
He's not. And who is?

902
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,992
Well, we kind of left
that part out before

903
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:05,605
because we didn't think you'd like it.

904
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,438
It's Kalabar, Mom.

905
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,675
- Aggie told you that.
- Marnie, but Grandma thinks so, too.

906
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:18,710
Oh, I see, and so Alex is what,
an actor that Cal hired?

907
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,949
Sophie has a theory.

908
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,356
I think he's a golem.

909
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,826
- A golem.
- Made of frogs.

910
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:37,233
You know, you did undo Cal's spell once.

911
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:40,902
- What do you mean?
- With me - the Gray Spell.

912
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,468
No, it just wore off.

913
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,514
It didn't wear off of Benny or Gort.

914
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,245
It had to have been
something you did or said.

915
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,253
Like what?

916
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,587
Well, uh, all right, you were searching
through Aggie's house...

917
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,856
Right, and you were picking your nose.

918
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,294
And you couldn't find
the second spell book.

919
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:05,391
Right, so I was trying to get
Grandma to think of something else,

920
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,936
some other way to break the spell.

921
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:11,167
No, but you didn't say spell.
You said something else.

922
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,606
So?

923
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,873
So maybe whatever you said
undid the spell.

924
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,381
I would've had to be talking backwards
to undo the spell.

925
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,282
Maybe it was in there
backwards somehow.

926
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,951
OK. Um...

927
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,889
I think I called it a trap. Uh...

928
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,256
Something to get us out of this trap.

929
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,159
All right, why don't you
just say it all again?

930
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:43,229
OK, it was something like,
something to get us out of this trap.

931
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,173
A spell or a charm.

932
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,870
This trap.

933
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:56,216
A spell... or a...

934
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,880
You didn't say "charm," I know that.

935
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,981
Something backwards. Uh...

936
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,720
Trap, no.

937
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,321
Spell or a... no.

938
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:12,300
Wait, wait.
Here, trapa.

939
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,270
- Trapa?
- Yeah, it's "apart" backwards.

940
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,771
So?

941
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,673
So, does every spell have to be long?

942
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,109
No. Some spells are short.

943
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,511
- Then say this like a spell.
- But it's one word.

944
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,983
- Will you just try it?
- Fine.

945
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,724
Apart.

946
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,720
Oh, my.

947
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,426
Oh, my.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

948
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:49,268
This place is very, very messy.

949
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,364
All right, now say it backwards.

950
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:52,840
Uh...

951
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,809
Trapa?

952
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:04,210
That was awful.

953
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,745
I wanted to... clean.

954
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,258
- Try it again.
- OK.

955
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,089
Apart.

956
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,088
- Oh, my. Oh, my.
- (Both chuckle)

957
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:22,230
Does anyone have a, uh...
a dustpan perhaps?

958
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,000
Trapa.

959
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,780
Will you stop doing that?

960
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,943
You were right. We figured out
how to break the Gray Spell,

961
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,714
and now we can get our full powers back.

962
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,119
How much time do we have left
before the portal closes?

963
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,090
15 minutes.

964
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,922
Oh, my gosh, Mom doesn't
know about the Creature Spell.

965
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,723
What if she's still wearing that mask?

966
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,156
We have to get back to the present
before we can warn her.

967
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:52,556
Right. Uh...

968
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,093
Where's the time-travel spell?

969
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,538
What do you mean?
You had it.

970
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,975
Right, well, I put it
over there on that table

971
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,275
when I had to dig through the garbage.

972
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,544
Oh...

973
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:13,055
You shouldn't have done that.

974
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,885
Uh...

975
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,654
Why not?
What happened to it?

976
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,491
It's lost.

977
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:26,195
Well, that's OK, right, because
things that get lost end up here.

978
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,932
Everything that's lost
other places ends up here.

979
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,272
But things that are lost here go poof.

980
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,044
- Poof?
- Poof.

981
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,674
Gone... forever.

982
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,116
Poof.

983
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,212
Please tell me that you
remember the spell.

984
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,986
It was Welsh.
I could barely read it.

985
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,551
So we're stuck here?
We can't be stuck here.

986
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,121
OK, OK, all right.
Let me think.

987
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,862
(reciting spell)

988
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,813
(growls)

989
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,246
Uh...

990
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,052
No, that's not it.

991
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,785
Excuse me.

992
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,660
And as for you, Dylan,
I would've expected you to be more...

993
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,324
Hey, I brought you guys some cookies.

994
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,667
- Everything all right?
- Um, yeah, just peachy.

995
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,228
- Where's Cal?
- Sophie?

996
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,242
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

997
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,246
Your daughter stood him up. I'm afraid
he's a little bit hurt, poor fella.

998
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,941
Why did you pick that costume?

999
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,280
OK, guys, I think it's time
that you were running.

1000
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,102
'Cause the funny thing
is, I just saw this

1001
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:55,417
seventh grader dressed
up as a big fly.

1002
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,858
- A fly.
- Dylan.

1003
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,863
A big black one with
feelers and fuzzy legs.

1004
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,326
Mm.

1005
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,393
I can even show you what he looked like.

1006
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,598
Sweetheart, not here.

1007
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,106
(buzzing)

1008
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:16,908
Sophie, you know that you're not allowed
to do magic around strangers.

1009
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,447
Mommy, look.

1010
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,041
Alex?

1011
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,814
Are you all right?

1012
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,382
Oh, that's not normal.

1013
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,616
(gulps)

1014
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,091
Oh, that was very good.

1015
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,427
You're not human.

1016
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,602
Ha.

1017
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,832
Nobody's perfect.

1018
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:49,503
You... you... you... you golem.

1019
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,538
(recites spell)

1020
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,982
Does anybody know
where we can find a swamp?

1021
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,618
Ohh, he was so perfect.

1022
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,959
Except for the being-made-of-frogs part.

1023
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:12,764
I'm really sorry, you guys.
You came here to warn me, but Marnie...

1024
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,803
Marnie... where is she?

1025
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,954
She was in Halloweentown
last time she called.

1026
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:18,355
She and Grandma were having trouble

1027
01:01:18,356 --> 01:01:20,396
getting through the portal
because of Cal's spell.

1028
01:01:20,412 --> 01:01:22,292
It's almost midnight.
How did you talk to her?

1029
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:23,803
The head phone.

1030
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,549
Marnie?

1031
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,314
Marnie, can you hear me?

1032
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,913
The party you are trying to reach
is currently out of this dimension.

1033
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:37,431
If you'd like to leave a message.
Your party will receive it

1034
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:41,429
in approximately 400 years.

1035
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,658
400 years?

1036
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:47,134
Pooh bear thenatos 23 skidoo.

1037
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,276
Will you just stop saying that one?

1038
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,506
- I can't remember the spell.
- You have to.

1039
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,141
This is stupid.

1040
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,708
Why don't we just use my timeline?

1041
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,880
- Your what?
- My timeline.

1042
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,254
Some wizard must've lost it.

1043
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,852
- Come on, I keep it in the closet.
- Timeline?

1044
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,262
Wow, how does it work?

1045
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,826
The timelines tell us what year it is
in the mortal world.

1046
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,863
The past is one direction,
future is the other.

1047
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,568
You know, that looks just like
a Stephen Hawking description

1048
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:34,649
- of a non-stellar black hole.
- And your point is?

1049
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,949
Theoretically,
black holes can accelerate time.

1050
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,489
And that would help us how?

1051
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:46,620
Just follow the fastest-moving timeline.
Now get out of here.

1052
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:51,724
Gort, I'm a goblin.
Theoretically, I can't fly.

1053
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,861
Oh, yes, you can.

1054
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,376
- What's that?
- This...

1055
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,971
is my new-and-improved broom.

1056
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,413
- Grandma gave it to me.
- Wow.

1057
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,479
Cool, huh?

1058
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,695
Come on, get on.

1059
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,958
Could you lower it a little?

1060
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,792
Well, come on, just swing your leg over.

1061
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,860
I'm a little afraid of flying.

1062
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,965
- Oh, do you wanna stay here?
- No.

1063
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,067
Thought so.

1064
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,805
Whoa, whoa.
Just hold on a minute.

1065
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,315
Thanks, Gort.
We are out of here!

1066
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:44,012
(Gort) Goodbye and good riddance.

1067
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,919
Watch out, watch out.

1068
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,925
(Sophie) We've looked everywhere, Mom.

1069
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,544
(Dylan) I didn't see
that Cal guy anywhere.

1070
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:58,092
Do you think he's wearing a mask?

1071
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:02,001
(Gwen) I don't know. You guys go
hang out over by the refreshment table.

1072
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:05,802
Now, if you see him, don't do anything.
Just come and get me.

1073
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:09,834
And whatever he's planning,
it is up to us to stop him.

1074
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,972
I'm gonna wear my mask.
He knows me.

1075
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,808
"The Creature Spell."

1076
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,513
And so the fun begins.

1077
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,983
- Any luck?
- No.

1078
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,995
- He's here somewhere. I can feel it.
- So can I.

1079
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,897
We've gotta find him and get the
portal open before midnigh...

1080
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,229
The witchin' hour.

1081
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,603
Everyone, count down with me.
Here we go. 60...

1082
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:12,971
Find him.

1083
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,913
We're never gonna make it.

1084
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:25,147
The portal closes in just a few minutes,
and we're only in the 1600s.

1085
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:29,282
Hey, I think we should try to go
into that black hole over there.

1086
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,383
57, 56...

1087
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,928
This magic spell will transform
any human you choose

1088
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,863
into the creature they pretend to be,

1089
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,096
and I choose all of you.

1090
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,366
47, 46, 45,

1091
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:46,465
44, 43, 42,

1092
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,908
41, 40, 39...

1093
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:52,641
(recites spell)

1094
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,684
35, 34, 33,

1095
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:59,084
32, 31, 30,

1096
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,716
29, 28, 27, 26...

1097
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,421
Now... where was I?

1098
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,391
Oh, oh, oh...

1099
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,799
(partygoers counting down)

1100
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:20,364
- What is that?
- The portal.

1101
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:24,402
- Mommy.
- Sophie, honey, my mask won't come off.

1102
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,606
Try and pull it.

1103
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:29,117
By wind, by rain, by fire, by Earth,

1104
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,848
with this spell, I will avenge
their cruel jokes at our expense.

1105
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:42,322
And what if this black-hole theory,
let's say, doesn't work?

1106
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,423
Whoa.

1107
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,094
- (Marnie) Whoa!
- Aah!

1108
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,671
Hurry.
It's almost midnight.

1109
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,011
Grandma...

1110
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,242
You can do it.

1111
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,080
Trapa.

1112
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,082
Oh.

1113
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,093
Oh, yes.

1114
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:18,665
Grandma, we have to
go back to the mortal world.

1115
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,032
Yes... yes.

1116
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,272
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1117
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,069
(both) From Halloweentown
depart we now,

1118
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,240
on this, the night, All Hallow's Eve,

1119
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:35,613
back into the mortal world.

1120
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:38,278
Through the portal, we take our leave!

1121
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,751
No!

1122
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,626
It's closing.

1123
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,663
It can't close now, it can't!

1124
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,222
Mama. No!

1125
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,768
- Pull from the top.
- I'm trying.

1126
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,104
Mom!

1127
01:07:56,238 --> 01:08:00,572
3, 2, 1!

1128
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,876
- Oh.
- (Luke) It's too late.

1129
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,353
Oh, yeah.
OK, OK, everyone.

1130
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,323
Now, before we tell the winners
of the costume contest,

1131
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,326
it's time for the great unmasking...

1132
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,192
Change them into the creature
whose disguise they have taken.

1133
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,694
(yells spell)

1134
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,835
(screams)

1135
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,605
(girl) I can't breathe!

1136
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,109
What's going on?

1137
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,649
Where's my other eye?

1138
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:47,781
Mom...

1139
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,163
Marnie, where are you?

1140
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,824
(screams)

1141
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,196
This can't be happening.

1142
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,199
That's weird.
My teeth won't come out.

1143
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,938
- I'm really thirsty.
- Cindy.

1144
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,210
Uh... uh...

1145
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,219
Cindy, stop it.

1146
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,118
Help me.

1147
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,658
I can't believe it.

1148
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,567
The portal's closed.

1149
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:40,166
We're gonna be stuck here
for a year of mortal-world time.

1150
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:45,475
I suppose it'll give us time to
train you, as we planned to do.

1151
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:50,747
And then, when the portal opens again,
we'll be ready to fight Cal.

1152
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:55,990
Just wait for a year of mortal time?

1153
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,686
It's gonna feel like a century here.

1154
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:03,192
- Whatever.
- No, not whatever.

1155
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,392
It's all my fault.

1156
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:13,305
It's all my fault Mom's been
turned into this horrible creature.

1157
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,811
There's gotta be something we can do.

1158
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:22,715
Marnie, I love them, too,
but I can't change the rules.

1159
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,215
Then maybe we can.

1160
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,259
What... What are you doing?

1161
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,124
Calling Sophie.

1162
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,993
Sophie.
Soph, are you there?

1163
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,056
(monsters yelling and growling)

1164
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,067
Marnie, is that you?

1165
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:47,236
Sophie, listen to me.
We're gonna open the portal.

1166
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,800
We can't.
It's after midnight.

1167
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:53,336
I don't care.
That's not gonna stop me.

1168
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,716
The portal hasn't always been there.

1169
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:01,722
It was created by magic, and nobody's
magic is stronger than ours, right?

1170
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:07,119
- I guess so.
- No. You've got to believe it.

1171
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,596
And Dylan has to, too.

1172
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,367
Come on.
What do you say?

1173
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:18,338
OK, but how do we do it?
There's no spell for this.

1174
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,875
We'll just have to make up our own.

1175
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,773
- Are you ready?
- What am I supposed to do?

1176
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,974
Stop thinking about it, Dylan.
Just feel it.

1177
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,925
Hey, I'm no warlock.

1178
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:44,244
I need somebody who
believes that anything

1179
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:46,724
is possible. Do you believe that?

1180
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,200
If you're there, yeah.

1181
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,303
Grandma.

1182
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:05,382
I'm not sure how this'll work out,
but I've always believed in you.

1183
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:15,094
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

1184
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,292
to heal the wound that worlds divide.

1185
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,649
From now on, we each
can create a portal,

1186
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:24,931
and each of us our own path decide.

1187
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:29,503
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

1188
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:32,604
to heal the wound that worlds divide.

1189
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:36,032
From now on, we each
can create a portal,

1190
01:12:36,033 --> 01:12:39,382
and each of us our own path decide.

1191
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:46,289
- What is that?
- Something's happening.

1192
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,964
I can't believe it.
She's trying to open the portal.

1193
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,807
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

1194
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,644
to heal the wound that worlds divide.

1195
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,208
From now on, we each
can create a portal,

1196
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:15,154
and each of us our own path decide.

1197
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,172
- Yes.
- Marnie!

1198
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,177
- We did it.
- Oh, look, there's Sophie.

1199
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,570
No. It's impossible!

1200
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:45,445
- Yes. Good job.
- That's him.

1201
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,245
(gasps)

1202
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:02,331
I don't care how strong you think you
are, but you could never beat me.

1203
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:07,041
Your only power
was the power to keep us apart, Cal.

1204
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,873
And now you don't have
that power anymore.

1205
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,643
We don't have to hate each other.

1206
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,815
Just give me back Aggie's spell books.

1207
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,117
Dad was right. You're the
enemy, and you always will be.

1208
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,162
You told me you make your own decisions.

1209
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,926
Don't let your father's hate
decide for you now.

1210
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:31,988
Go ahead.

1211
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:39,431
Take the books.
I'd like to watch.

1212
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:46,339
Is good stronger than evil?
Let's find out.

1213
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,213
I'm not afraid of you.
I may feel sorry for you,

1214
01:14:55,290 --> 01:15:00,387
and I'd like to help you,
but I'm not afraid of you.

1215
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,998
Marnie, be careful.

1216
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,097
Aah!

1217
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,387
He'll be back.

1218
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,255
And we'll be waiting... together.

1219
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:11,957
- Grandma, will you do the honors?
- Of course, dear.

1220
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,528
Oh, Luke.

1221
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,005
(reading spell backwards)

1222
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:45,958
Wow, I just had the weirdest dream.
Was I asleep?

1223
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,932
Well, I don't know who
put this all together,

1224
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:57,775
but let's have a big hand
for the best Halloween party ever, huh?!

1225
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,474
Huh? Yeah.

1226
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,609
Whoo.

1227
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,219
Yeah.

1228
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:13,619
Mom.

1229
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,526
You're OK.

1230
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:20,557
Mother.

1231
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,568
I don't know if I'll ever
stop you guys from fighting,

1232
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,668
but at least you won't have to
fight over me anymore.

1233
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:34,409
I know you both have things to teach me,
and now I don't have to choose.

1234
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,511
I'm not sure what I'm
going to teach you.

1235
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,453
It seems Marnie already
knows more than I do.

1236
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:43,753
We better go back to Halloweentown
and get rid of the Gray Spell.

1237
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:48,990
- Quite right. You coming?
- I don't think so, Mom.

1238
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,055
This is my world.

1239
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:54,068
But I guess the kids can come and visit
you any time they want

1240
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,627
now that they've figured out
their way around the rules.

1241
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:59,572
Then you can expect me for dinner
next Halloween.

1242
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,701
- You be good, sweetheart.
- Oh, you too, Mom.

1243
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,803
- Bye.
- Bye.

1244
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,755
All right, come on.
Let's get you out of here

1245
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,796
before somebody gives you
the prize for best mask.

1246
01:18:10,797 --> 01:18:12,513
- Ya think?
- Yeah. You, too.

1247
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,923
Trapa.

1248
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,056
Trapa.

1249
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,900
Trapa.

1250
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:35,106
Trapa. Trapa.

1251
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,508
Trapa.

1252
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,478
- Just try it.
- He's busy.

1253
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,347
I've got your receipt... right here.

1254
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,017
Trapa.

1255
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:50,784
Wow, talk about going on
a crash diet. Ha-ha.

1256
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,630
(cheers and applause)

1257
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,763
- Yay!
- Yes.

1258
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:12,073
What's everybody so happy about?

1259
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:16,914
- Hey, she did it. She changed it back.
- Yeah, check it out.

1260
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:23,754
So this World Wide Web I've heard
about - does it involve spiders?

1261
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:28,554
Grandma... I think it's time
maybe we started your training.

1262
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,531
- Ooh, I'd like that.
- Yeah.

1263
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,591
I'd like that.

1264
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:51,982
[Music] Under a cloak of black
and a pointed witch's hat

1265
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:56,046
[music] I saw a face that made
a chill run down my spine

1266
01:19:56,124 --> 01:20:02,688
[music] When she looked me in the eye.
She must have hypnotized me

1267
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:08,396
[music] 'Cause the next thing I remember
I was there. Standing in her lair

1268
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,461
[music] Watching as she stirred

1269
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,134
[music] And then she looked at me.
And she said these words

1270
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,040
[music] Eye of newt and wing of bat

1271
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,409
[music] And a long black whisker
from a big black cat

1272
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,780
[music] Spider legs and wolfhound fur.
Bring it to a boil and begin to stir

1273
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,876
[music] Add poison ivy
with a hemlock root

1274
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,285
[music] And a thread from
the collar of a vampire suit

1275
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,380
[music] Guaranteed with
your money back. Too

1276
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:33,154
[music] But be careful when
you mess with witch's brew

1277
01:20:46,457 --> 01:20:49,154
