1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,838
(ominous music)

2
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,748
- What you mean there wasn't
 an earthquake last night?

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,085
Ground was shaking like
my old lady's cellulite.

4
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,519
- Man, I'm not saying
the Earth didn't shake,

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,953
I'm just saying there's nothing

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,022
humanalogical about it.
 - Well, it was on TV, genius.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,291
4.5 they said.

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,059
- Hey, our TV says
 a lot of things.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,229
- This another one of
 your conspiracy theories?

10
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,099
- Can you keep a secret?
- Maybe.

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,302
- It was aliens.
- Aliens?

12
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:35,769
- Yeah, aliens you heard me.

13
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,838
They're practicing death
rays on us all the time,

14
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,840
earthquakes,
 hurricanes, tsunamis.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,075
Now tell me this,

16
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,910
if the Earth is made
out of 71 percent water,

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,412
how come they are always hitting

18
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,580
densely populated areas, hmm?

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,116
Now what--

20
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,049
- You dumber than a box
 of hammers, you know that?

21
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,618
Well, you so dumb, you,

22
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,619
you dumber than Roux over there,

23
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,187
and that's saying something.

24
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,756
(both laughing)
- That one Roux

25
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,225
is pretty stupid.

26
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,959
- Hey, you fellas feel
 that earthquake last night?

27
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,994
- Man, that wasn't
 no earthquake,

28
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,331
and I don't care
 what you or him say.

29
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,699
(Roux groaning)
 - You okay there, big fella?

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,169
(Roux groans)

31
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,804
- Something bit me last
night, something fierce.

32
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,140
- Last night, huh?

33
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,274
Sure it wasn't a woman?

34
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,109
- Couldn't have been a woman,

35
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,977
I was in bed at the time.

36
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,681
(both laughing)

37
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,218
- What are you two slack
offs laughing about?

38
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,653
- Nothing boss.
- Good,

39
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,289
'cause I want those eggs
 loaded and in town tout sweet.

40
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,658
Roux, front and center.
- Yeah, boss.

41
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,126
- Something getting
 in the henhouse.

42
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,894
Found two of them
 dead this morning.

43
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,129
- You think it's a fox?

44
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,330
- Well, that's what
 you're gonna find out.

45
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,798
Take the shotgun
 head on over there.

46
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,068
- You want me to kill it?

47
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,606
- That's the general idea.

48
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,341
Just be careful don't
 point that at anything

49
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,277
walking on two legs, you hear?
 - Yeah, yeah boss.

50
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,478
You, you can count on me.

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,814
- Whoa!
 - Whoops.

52
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,586
(Roux laughs)

53
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,292
(suspenseful music)

54
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,806
- [Worker] Get on out of here!

55
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,753
(ominous music)

56
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,804
- Eww!

57
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,442
Oh!

58
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,612
(Roux groaning)

59
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,595
(Roux groaning loudly)

60
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:21,969
(spider hissing)
 (suspenseful music)

61
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,592
(Roux groaning)

62
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:54,768
Argh!

63
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,772
(spider screaming)

64
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,343
(upbeat country rock music)

65
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,896
* Well all the girls
 I've known before *

66
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,065
- Paul!
* Have left me hungry

67
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,300
* Left me poor

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,901
- Aren't you
 forgetting something?

69
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,571
- Hey, I didn't
 wanna wake you up.

70
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,805
You know, I'm late for work

71
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,941
and uh, you looked like
an angel laying there.

72
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:37,878
- Call me.

73
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,753
* So won't you marry
 me a whiskey bottle *

74
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:50,758
* Give me a kiss and let me
 take a sip of your love *

75
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,564
* Suzie left me
 with a broken nose *

76
00:04:56,564 --> 00:05:00,033
* And when Amy left she
took all my clothes *

77
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,169
* Jenny turned out to be a man

78
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,072
* And Katie took
 off with my van *

79
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,841
* Another one just
 walked out the door *

80
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:12,846
* I ain't got no damn luck
 baby that's for sure *

81
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,986
* So won't you marry
 me a whiskey bottle *

82
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,991
* Give me a kiss and let me
 take a sip of your love *

83
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:31,599
* So won't you marry
 me a whiskey bottle *

84
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,604
* Give me a kiss and let me
 take a sip of your love *

85
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,576
* So won't you marry
 me a whiskey bottle *

86
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:47,581
* Give me a kiss and let me
 take a sip of your love *

87
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:54,888
* So won't you marry
 me a whiskey bottle *

88
00:05:56,323 --> 00:06:00,461
* Give me a kiss and let me
 take a sip of your love *

89
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,848
(birds squawking)

90
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,921
(distant people chattering)

91
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,994
- [Woman] Nice set!

92
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,400
- Seriously, two hours late.

93
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,935
That's a new low, even for you.

94
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,639
- Oh, sorry Pops, you're right.

95
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,907
Things just got a little

96
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,010
out of hand last night.

97
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,113
- Well, I hope you had fun.

98
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,584
It just cost us the first big
 money charter of the season.

99
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,985
It's coming out of your pay.

100
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,821
- What, they canceled?

101
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,055
- Yeah well that's what
 tourists do when they show up

102
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,891
for a grand tour
 the Louisiana swamp

103
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,693
and their transportation
is missing!

104
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,295
- Missing?

105
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,998
What's he talking about?

106
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,901
- You don't remember anything
 from last night, do you?

107
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,069
- Uh, it's all a little hazy.

108
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,973
- Dammit, son.

109
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,309
You didn't even
 know who she was?

110
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,745
- Good news, I
 just talked to Moe

111
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,279
and our boat is caught on a bank

112
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,815
about a mile below Gators Way.

113
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,683
He saw her on his
 way in this morning.

114
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,119
- Please, please tell me that
 she's still in one piece.

115
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,387
- As far as he could tell.
 - See, good news!

116
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,923
Glass half-full, Pops.

117
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,057
- Yeah.

118
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,391
- Uh, y'all have any Bayer?

119
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:43,564
- Don't you think it's
 a little early, Paul?

120
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,397
- Ugh...

121
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,869
Bayer, you know
 like the Tylenol?

122
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,604
You know, I was asking
 if you had any Bayer.

123
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,439
- Come here, come on, I
 wanna show you something.

124
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,207
- Pops, Pops.
 - Get, get, come on.

125
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,010
I wanna show you
 something over here.

126
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,515
You see this?
 - Who's that handsome devil?

127
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,651
- That's me, when I
 was your sister's age,

128
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,686
defusing mines in
 the Gulf of Tonkin,

129
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,320
risking my ass every day.

130
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,957
What the hell have
 you ever risked, huh?

131
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,992
Except for STDs and
 a swollen liver.

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,496
- I put my time in Pops.
- Yeah, yeah,

133
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,066
the least amount that
 you can get away with.

134
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,801
That boat was your
 responsibility, Paul.

135
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,402
It was your only responsibility.

136
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,739
From now on Pepper is gonna
 handle the boat tours.

137
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,107
- What?

138
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,910
- You're demoted to
driving the trolley bus.

139
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,880
- Pops you said I'm the
 face of Lacrosse Adventures.

140
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,582
- Yeah and if you ever
 wanna be the head,

141
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,083
you'll shut up and
 do like I tell you,

142
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,952
or you're gonna be shucking
 oysters the rest of your life.

143
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,487
- You won't regret this, Daddy.

144
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,023
I'm gonna restore some
 pride to the family name.

145
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,291
(Paul mumbling)
 - Let's go, honey.

146
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,795
You got a bus tour
 leaving in an hour.

147
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,997
Don't screw this up
 or you're outta here.

148
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,531
There's no more second chances.

149
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,736
(melancholy music)

150
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,280
(girls chattering)

151
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,320
- I hear it's really
 massive, but...

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,824
(girls giggling)
- Whoopsies!

153
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,192
- Take a picture,
 it'll last longer.

154
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,595
- I just did, heh heh heh.
 - That's disgusting.

155
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:33,641
- [Charlie] Alright girls,
 come on, get on the bus.

156
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,442
- We gotta get going Charlie.

157
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,910
I scheduled this tour for noon.

158
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,648
- I know, I know, I know,
 I gotta wake up Barb.

159
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,316
Hey, Tam, Tam, Tam, do you
 know where my hard-working

160
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,318
punctual assistant
 is by any chance?

161
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,754
- She said she wasn't
 feeling well, Coach.

162
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,521
I think she's still
 up in her room.

163
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,793
- Ha ha ha, I told her to
 take it easy on the champagne,

164
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,061
I swear I did.

165
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,296
Hi, guys.
- Hurry up, Dad.

166
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,998
- Come on.
- I'm hurrying.

167
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,737
(knocking at door)

168
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,571
Barb.

169
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:09,309
Come on, wake up, we
got a long drive today.

170
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,281
You decent?

171
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,586
Barb?
 (Barb groans)

172
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,057
Barb?

173
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,398
(dramatic music)
Oh, my god!

174
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,767
- Help me.
- What happened to you?

175
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,244
- Whoa let's see New Orleans.

176
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,413
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
 you know what?

177
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,148
That might be a
 bit of a problem.

178
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,950
- Now what?
- Barb can't go.

179
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,319
It's like she had
 herpes on her face.

180
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,586
- [Katelynn] I could
 care less about her.

181
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,022
I want you to come
 with us on the tour.

182
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,724
Don't come with us, and there's
gonna be a huge problem,

183
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,258
between all of us.
 - Well, you know what?

184
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,694
It's not my fault that
 she got bitten, okay?

185
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,630
- Bit, by what?
- I don't know.

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,799
She wasn't making
 a lot of sense.

187
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,436
She had these like weird
scary cysts over face.

188
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,539
- Maybe it's the Black
 Death, that causes cysts.

189
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,975
- Oh crap, really?
 - Yes, it does,

190
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,443
but I don't think
 they have a plague

191
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,545
from the Middle
 Ages in New Orleans.

192
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,913
- Could be leprosy.

193
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,115
- It's not leprosy, it's
not the Black Plague.

194
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,784
- It doesn't matter,
 I called an ambulance,

195
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,152
so they'll take
 care of it, right?

196
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,187
It'll be fine, it'll
 be fine, and you guys,

197
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,521
you guys are late for
 the tour, alright?

198
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,689
So, you guys gotta get there.

199
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,158
- What, you're really
 not gonna come?

200
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,127
- Barb's gonna be
 out of commission

201
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,029
for a little while, okay?

202
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,697
Somebody's got to
 drive these Amazon's

203
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,599
back to Houston, right?

204
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,769
- Dad, I'm not
 sleeping in there.

205
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,604
It's probably
 infested with bedbugs,

206
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,306
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
 yeah you're right.

207
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,507
You guys should get a hotel.

208
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,542
- Some vacation, huh?
 - It'll be fun.

209
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,413
I'll make it up,
I'll make it up.

210
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,149
Have fun guys.

211
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,586
* Walking through these hills

212
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,654
* Walking through these shores

213
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,623
* Walking through these hills

214
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,793
* Walking through these shores

215
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,795
* Walking through these hills

216
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,363
* Walking through these shores

217
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,432
* Walking through these hills

218
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,336
* Walking through these shores

219
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,142
(knocking at bus door)

220
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,319
(man groaning)

221
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,090
(lighthearted music)

222
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,776
(ears ringing)

223
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,091
- Hey yo, what's up homie?

224
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,726
You our driver, yo?
- Yeah, looks that way.

225
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,495
- You look like you
 been through hell.

226
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,098
Well anyway, I'm Glen,
 this is my wife Tina.

227
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,833
- Hello.
 - Enchante, madam.

228
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,003
- Ooh, honey did you hear
 that, he speaks French.

229
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,838
- Yeah, whatever.
 - He must be Cajun.

230
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:28,008
- Anyway, come on, come on.
 - Okay, thank you.

231
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,809
- Ha ha ha, that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

232
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,811
I told you, I'm
 legend Cajun in life.

233
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,281
- You're special.
- You enjoying yourself?

234
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,984
- This is so exciting!
(both chatting quietly)

235
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,485
- I see we're short a few.

236
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,420
I guess black bus
 couldn't make it, so.

237
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:49,629
You must be Mr.
 Gram-po-what-ska, or
 something another.

238
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,865
Can I just call you Gramps?

239
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,401
- If you want my
 cane up your keister.

240
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,202
- Alright.

241
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,772
- Sorry, we're late,
 Blackwells party of three.

242
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,641
We're short one, my
 husband couldn't make it.

243
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,410
- Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.

244
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,484
Ah, we're ready to
 roll, excellent.

245
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,053
(clears throat)

246
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:13,887
Oh...

247
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:18,926
My name is Paul.

248
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,295
I'm gonna be your
 tour guide today.

249
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,997
If you have any
 questions, please,

250
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,865
a dollar in the tip
 jar and ask away.

251
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,702
- Let's get this show on the
 road, how's that for a tip?

252
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,845
- Buckle up your seat belts.

253
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,613
- [Justin] Hey, we don't
have any seat belts.

254
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,684
(lighthearted music)

255
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,027
- Canal Street was in
fact named after a canal

256
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,663
that was meant to be
 built and never was.

257
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,731
It was once the widest
 street in the world,

258
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,767
and to your right,
 Bourbon Street.

259
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,369
Most people don't realize
 that Bourbon Street

260
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,104
was actually named after
the French royal family,

261
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,538
not the whiskey,

262
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,706
although there's one
 last place in the country

263
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,441
you can still drink
 on the street.

264
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,876
- Hey, you know that's right.

265
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,511
- Ooh, I'll bet the booze
 is really good here.

266
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,913
Hey driver, can we hop off
 and get some cocktails?

267
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,316
- Sure if you wanna
 tuck and roll.

268
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,685
'Cause this tram don't
 stop for nothing.

269
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,188
(funky music)

270
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,260
- What is with you
 and those peas?

271
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,461
- It's protein.

272
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,297
It puts hair on your
back, you should try it.

273
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,232
- I can see that.

274
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,633
- Justin, eat them,
open your mouth, Justin.

275
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,468
- Annabelle, cut it out!
- Open your mouth!

276
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,204
- Ugh, it's like I
 swallowed the Sun!

277
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,038
- Please?

278
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,341
Can I ask a question?

279
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,110
Last night there
 was an earthquake.

280
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,012
I mean, that's not common
 in these parts is it?

281
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,879
- [Paul] It it depends on
 how much bourbon you've had.

282
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,348
- We felt it too.

283
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,851
I almost peed in my pants,
 but Glen thought it was funny.

284
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,953
- It says here that New
 Orleans is below sea level

285
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,255
and sinking all the time.

286
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,823
Maybe that's what we
felt, the city sinking.

287
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:57,991
- You're thinking of Venice.

288
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,027
- I am not, it
 says so right here.

289
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,995
- Hey, a voodoo shop,
 can we stop please?

290
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,196
- Young lady like I said before,

291
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,597
this tram don't--
 - Stop!

292
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,303
(ominous music)

293
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,645
- I need y'all to stay put.

294
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,320
- What is that?

295
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,723
- It smell like natural gas.
 - I'm lactose-intolerant.

296
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,992
- There's a huge shale
 layer under Louisiana.

297
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,528
Maybe this is some
 sort of biogassing.

298
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,564
- Hey, look, look at
 that, out of my way!

299
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,935
- That's disgusting.

300
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,404
- It's not just
disgusting, it's nature.

301
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,906
- Oh, I didn't know
 they came that big.

302
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:47,807
- Let me see that.

303
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,443
Huh.

304
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,282
It doesn't have any eyes.

305
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,484
It's blind.
 - Oh, poor little guy.

306
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,819
- Well, it probably lives
 underground in the dark.

307
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,321
It doesn't need them.

308
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,224
- Somebody should get
him a little white cane.

309
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,025
- Are you some
 kind of scientist?

310
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,627
- I teach eighth grade biology.

311
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,961
- I knew it.

312
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,763
- Let me see that thing.

313
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,469
- Ew, gross!
(spider hisses)

314
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,937
- Feisty little fella isn't he?

315
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,173
- Hey, I'm gonna need
 y'all back on the bus.

316
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,477
- Uh, guys.
(all whimpering)

317
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,445
- Something on my face?

318
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,250
(all shrieking)
 Ooh, what is that?

319
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,357
- This tour officially sucks!

320
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,591
Gimme that!
 - What are you doing?

321
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,593
- [Justin] This thing
is obviously dangerous.

322
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,694
- [Annabelle] I was
 gonna keep that.

323
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,363
- You always do this.
 - Now, out!

324
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,334
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

325
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,102
- Hey, I got him, I got him,

326
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,837
I got him, I got him.

327
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,906
(spider thumps)

328
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,510
(Paul breathing heavily)
 I have to work on my putt.

329
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,878
- What was that?
 - Did you see how big it was?

330
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,614
- Gramps, get on the
 bus, get on the bus!

331
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,988
(banging on metal roof)
(spiders squealing)

332
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,590
- Back on the bus!

333
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,259
Come on, get on
 the bus, come on!

334
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,460
- [Glen] You drive us now!

335
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,061
- Please tell me
 that was a coconut!

336
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,296
- Something is on the roof.

337
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,730
- Shut the windows,
 shut the windows.

338
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,031
- [Paul] Everybody
 grab your seats!

339
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,871
(tires squealing)
 (dramatic music)

340
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,815
(spiders thunking)
(electricity crackling)

341
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,585
(spider hissing)

342
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,290
(suspenseful music)

343
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:05,144
- What are we stopping for?
 - Gotta get gas.

344
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,048
- Are you sure this
 is a good idea?

345
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,683
Those things are
right behind us.

346
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,154
- [Glen] Yeah, but I
 think we lost them.

347
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,856
- Yeah, maybe they found
someone else to chew on.

348
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,225
- Spiders don't eat people.

349
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,427
I don't care how big
 or how blind they are.

350
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,931
- On Okinawa I saw a
 tarantula size of a grapefruit

351
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,767
suck a man's eyeball
 right out of his head.

352
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:34,907
Of course, he was
 dead at the time.

353
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,478
- Come on, let's go.
 - Where you going?

354
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,879
- See if they have
 some bug repellent or,

355
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,448
or bear traps or something.

356
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,015
- Good call.
- Hey, wait up.

357
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,685
- Guys, stay where
 I can see you.

358
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,990
(suspenseful music)

359
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,062
- What can I do you for?
- Hey, do you have

360
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,630
any Raid or bug spray?

361
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,831
- You got a couple
critters to whack, huh?

362
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,167
- Yeah, you got any
insect repellent or not?

363
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,303
- If I do, it'd
 be on aisle seven.

364
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,137
- Aisle seven.
 - Seven.

365
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,851
- How is 9-1-1 busy?

366
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,087
- Did you see those things?

367
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,757
This is definitely
 a brand new species.

368
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,527
- Yeah, maybe they'll
 name it after you.

369
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,662
- You don't get it, I
 have a master's in zoology

370
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,465
and I have never
 even heard of this.

371
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,201
- You must be a big hit
with the eighth graders.

372
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,469
- This is not funny.

373
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,170
- Depends on your
 sense of humor.

374
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,973
(Katelynn sighs)

375
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,376
- Life must be
 easy for you, huh?

376
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,946
You flash that dopey smile
 and things go your way.

377
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,282
This is different.

378
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,051
- Whatever this is,

379
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,587
it'll be wrapped up in
time for the 6:00 news.

380
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,289
- Don't you care that
 people are in danger?

381
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,958
- Yeah, I care, but
 I'm a tour bus driver.

382
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,327
I'm not the Green Power Ranger.

383
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,861
- Oh, watch it!

384
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,166
- Watch this!

385
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,169
(walk sign beeping)

386
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:14,441
(Katelynn whimpers)

387
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,274
- Come on!

388
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,512
(mellow jazz music)

389
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,216
- That's it.

390
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,786
- This expired two years ago.

391
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,187
- Beggars can't be choosers.

392
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,190
- Guys, they're coming!
- Spiders!

393
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,792
- They're coming,
 they're coming!

394
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,562
- Jumbo's spiders,
some as big as dwarves.

395
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:36,896
- Jumbo dwarves?

396
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,465
- Call the police,
 call the exterminator.

397
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,967
- Exterminator?
- Am I speaking Chinese?

398
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,671
- What part of jumbo spiders
 don't you understand?

399
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,972
- Call somebody, anybody.

400
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,575
- What did I miss?
 - He's calling

401
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,976
the exterminator.

402
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:54,614
- Man, I don't feel so good.

403
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,216
(bubble pops)
 (women shrieking)

404
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,720
(all whimpering)
- Oh, God.

405
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,697
(spider chattering)

406
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:17,470
(suspenseful music)
 (all groaning)

407
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:24,243
(eggs crunching)
 (spiders chattering)

408
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,845
- [Paul] Oh!

409
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,747
- Argh!
- Come on, Paul!

410
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,751
- Argh!

411
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,252
You disgust, argh!

412
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:40,893
(dramatic music)
 (spiders chattering)

413
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,736
- This what you want, playboy?

414
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:51,838
Huh?

415
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,208
(Justin shrieking)

416
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,983
(both whimpering)

417
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:07,319
(Anabelle screaming)

418
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,056
(dramatic music)

419
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,768
(wine gurgling)

420
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:32,111
(fire roaring)
 (spiders screaming)

421
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,624
(cans rattling)

422
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:45,858
- You think it's dead?

423
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,226
- I don't know,
 check it and see.

424
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,367
Looks pretty dead to me.

425
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,936
- Glen!
 - Go, go, go, go!

426
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,944
- Oh, there's a giant
 spider right there!

427
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,714
(all whimpering)

428
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,251
- What, what do we do now?

429
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,688
(suspenseful music)

430
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,657
- What, what did I do?

431
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:20,326
- You're in control,
 what do we do now?

432
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,994
- Uh, just a second.

433
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,397
- What, who are you calling?

434
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,866
- My boss.
 - Your boss?

435
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:27,700
- No, babe.

436
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,310
(phone rings)

437
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,479
- Yeah.
- Pops.

438
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,748
This is Paul, listen
 there's a problem.

439
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,349
- I don't wanna hear
 any problems, Paul.

440
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,917
- Listen to me.
 - You listen to me.

441
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,386
I told you what would happen
 if you screwed this up.

442
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,256
You're 30 years old,
 start acting like it.

443
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,525
- Pops.
 (phone beeps)

444
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:55,528
(suspenseful music)

445
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,064
Pops.

446
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,466
- Everything's gonna be okay.

447
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,267
He hung up on me.
 - Be cool.

448
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,870
- Hey, listen to this.

449
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,004
This says here that
 the shale layer

450
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,173
goes all the way to Houston.

451
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,474
- No way.
 - What does that mean?

452
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,643
Is it happening back home too?

453
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,477
- Charlie.

454
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:18,117
(swamp life chattering)

455
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:34,466
(hip hop music)
 (girls chattering)

456
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,535
- Whoo!
- Woah, come on!

457
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,638
- Go girl, dancer.
 - Dig it.

458
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,372
* It drives me crazy

459
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,108
* I got it baby

460
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,776
* I got it baby

461
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,778
* Girl 
 * I got it baby

462
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,146
- [Charlie] Hey,
this is Charlie,

463
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,582
leave me a message,
 and I'll hit you back.

464
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:50,817
- Dammit, Charlie!

465
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:55,487
(glass shatters)
 (Katelynn screams)

466
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,956
- Why is there another spider?

467
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,058
There's another spider.
- Another spider?

468
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,828
- Okay, listen, get to the bus.

469
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,095
Get them out of here, okay.

470
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,430
I'll hold this one
 off, y'all go, go!

471
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,266
- But, baby!
 - Listen, babe, go.

472
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll be there in a minute, okay?

473
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,035
Just go!

474
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,572
(spider hissing)

475
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,008
(can thunks)

476
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,414
(dramatic music)

477
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,721
- Y'all hold up!

478
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,861
Come on, sir, come on.
 - I'm coming, I'm coming,

479
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,129
I'm coming.
- You can do it.

480
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,668
- Huh, wait, oh dear!

481
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:49,008
(spider hisses)
 (muffled groaning)

482
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,511
- Paul, come on, leave
him, he's dead already.

483
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,620
(tires squealing)

484
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:12,799
- Give it some gas, honey.
 (motor revving)

485
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,537
Alright, we got it.

486
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:29,415
Alright, okay,
 keep this together.

487
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,951
- Throw me the rope.

488
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,187
(Petra gasps)

489
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:35,988
Dad!

490
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,825
- What?
- Look.

491
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,797
- Is that?
 - Well, that's Armand alright.

492
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:47,299
Damn, you see that
 scar right there?

493
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,201
Propeller did that
 to him back in '02.

494
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,538
What the hell happened to him?

495
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,907
- What are those things?
- Beats me.

496
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,342
You know, Armand
was getting old,

497
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,045
but he was still the toughest
 son of a gun in a swamp.

498
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,512
- Hope Mama is okay.

499
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,948
- Ain't nothing alive
 that could take on

500
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,983
one Louisiana Gator
 let alone two.

501
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,519
The old girl is
 probably in mourning.

502
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,255
We'll report it when
 we get back to town.

503
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,289
Come on.
 - Alright.

504
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,997
(motor rumbling)

505
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,070
(dramatic music)

506
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,759
(sirens wailing)

507
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,960
- They're blind.

508
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,929
They must be using some
sort of echolocation

509
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,498
to find their prey.
- Like bats, like bats.

510
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,438
- You alright?
 - Yeah.

511
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,840
- Aw, what's this?

512
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,178
(suspenseful music)

513
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,613
- What are you stopping for?

514
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,081
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,616
Make a left.

516
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,051
- Dude left is gonna take
 us back into the Quarter.

517
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,385
Those roads are made for
 horse carriage, not trolleys.

518
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,021
- We appreciate the
 trivia and everything,

519
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,688
but enough is enough!
 - Yeah!

520
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,991
- Right, okay this tour
is officially over.

521
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,592
You're no longer the captain.

522
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,294
Give me the keys,
 I'm going back.

523
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,364
- Dude, you ain't the tour
 guide of nothing, chill out!

524
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,598
- Don't tell him to chill out!

525
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,934
At least he's trying
 to get us outta here.

526
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,302
- We're on the same side.
 - Forget that.

527
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,971
You screwed up and
 you're messed up.

528
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,673
Whoever want me to drive
 this bus, raise your hand.

529
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,043
- See?

530
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,379
Hey, come here!

531
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,814
- Dude, dude, we
 can talk about this.

532
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,015
- Gimme the keys!
 - Calm down.

533
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,851
- Gimme the keys!
 - Nope!

534
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:46,853
Nobody picks me, put me down!

535
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,921
Nobody picks me up, man!

536
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:52,491
- Gimme the--
 (ominous rumbling)

537
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:57,396
(suspenseful music)
 (woman screams)

538
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,230
- What was that?

539
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:02,701
- I don't know, I think
another earthquake.

540
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:07,706
(explosion echoes)
 (dramatic music)

541
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,814
- [Paul] Get outta there!

542
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,449
- Gimme the keys!
 - Get off me, man!

543
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,684
Sit down!

544
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,987
Sit in!
 - Just get us outta here!

545
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,523
- Mom?

546
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:25,824
- Her inhaler has run out.

547
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,031
(engine rattling)
 - I can't find the spare.

548
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,532
- She always keeps
 it in her purse.

549
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,234
- I know, but I can't
 find it, Justin.

550
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,535
- No, she's not
 looking too good.

551
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,905
- No kidding, we gotta
get her to a drugstore.

552
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,472
- A drugstore, now?

553
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,874
- There's one right across
 the street from the shop.

554
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,443
- How far?
 - Uh, 10 minutes tops.

555
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,745
- It doesn't matter,
 anywhere but here, go go go!

556
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:47,880
- Yes.
 (engine roars)

557
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,784
Come on!
 (tires squealing)

558
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,297
- Oh my God, Dad.

559
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,300
The French Quarter.

560
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,109
- [Dad] Your brother
better not have anything

561
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:17,944
to do with this.

562
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,350
- [Paul] Hey, this is
 Paul, I'm not in right now,

563
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,652
probably because I'm out
doing something awesome.

564
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,190
- Stay with the
 boat, don't move.

565
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,092
- Where are you going?

566
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,660
- I'm gonna find your brother,

567
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,295
and when I do I'm
 gonna kill him.

568
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,466
(suspenseful music)

569
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,773
(spiders hissing)

570
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,242
(guns firing)

571
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,714
- I don't wanna hear it.

572
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,915
- [Glen] Why would you
 even stop right here.

573
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,184
- You said go this way.

574
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,485
- You the one, you,
 this is your city.

575
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,953
- [Paul] How is supposed
to go through the town,

576
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:01,887
make any difference if you're
 driving or if I'm driving.

577
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,289
We'd still run into cops.

578
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,323
- [Glen] This is crazy,
they're shooting at everything.

579
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,557
(phone ringing)

580
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,925
This is why you
 have a dollar tip.

581
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,827
- Hey, I earned that dollar.
 (girls screaming)

582
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,497
- Yeah, girl!
 - Go get it, girls!

583
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,834
(electronic dance music)

584
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,607
(girls moaning in disapproval)
 - Hey, calm down,

585
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,809
I got a call.
 - What, why are we

586
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:24,943
not getting--
 - Hey!

587
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,212
How's my little princess?

588
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,379
You guys enjoying your tour?

589
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,615
- Dad, there's
 spiders everywhere.

590
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,217
- You guys at the zoo?
- No I'm not at the zoo.

591
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,319
I'm in front of the drugstore.
 - Drugstore?

592
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,287
(gun firing)

593
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,756
Hey wait a minute, is
 that gunfire I hear?

594
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,058
- Dad, I need you
 to listen to me.

595
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,326
Now, there's giant spiders

596
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,427
and they're coming
 out of the ground.

597
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:42,661
I think that's what got Barb.

598
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,363
- I told you if I caught
you huffing that crap

599
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,632
one more time, I would--
 - Dad, they're everywhere!

600
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,334
- Grounded for life,
 I'm not even joking.

601
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,868
- Dad, I'm not high!

602
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:53,239
Mom's having an asthma attack,
 and I can't find a refill.

603
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:55,874
- Calm down, okay, it'll
all be taken care of...

604
00:32:57,276 --> 00:33:02,181
What the hell is that?
 (girls chattering)

605
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,985
Holy crap, hold on!

606
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,320
(tires squealing)

607
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,624
I'm very nice!
 (bus crunches)

608
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,261
- Dad, Dad?

609
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,063
- Are you insane,
 Mr. College Boy,

610
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,264
you don't have to show me,

611
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,765
you got to show me
 your master's degree.

612
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,400
You don't have a master's.
 - I'll show you my master's.

613
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,405
(steam hissing)
 (Charlie panting)

614
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,910
- What are you thinking,
you look divine!

615
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,911
I like that.

616
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,281
- Is everybody okay?

617
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,921
(siren wailing)

618
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:53,565
(Katelynn gasping)

619
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,782
- I'm sure there's
 something we could do.

620
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,452
I know mouth to mouth.
 - Don't even think about it.

621
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,488
- That won't work, asthma
 constricts the airways.

622
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,056
Oxygen can't get into the lungs.

623
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,592
- [Paul] Hey, wait
 a minute, heliox?

624
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,827
- What?
 - Heliox.

625
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:24,296
It's the helium oxygen
 mix that divers use.

626
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,831
- And?

627
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,199
- At the bottom of the ocean,
 you can't breathe normal air,

628
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,135
'cause it's too much
 pressure, so they use heliox,

629
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,737
'cause it takes less energy
 to ventilate the lungs.

630
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,406
I think it's the same
principle as an inhaler.

631
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,907
- Can you get us some?

632
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,144
- Yeah, he's got two tanks on
 his boat with his dive suit.

633
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:40,379
- Great, where's the boat?

634
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,148
- Five miles up river.
 - What?

635
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:44,550
- You gotta be
 kidding me, right?

636
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,886
(horn honking)

637
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:48,720
- Pops?

638
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,198
Pops, move!

639
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:06,272
- This place is crawling
with giant spiders.

640
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:08,207
Please tell me this
 isn't your fault.

641
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,242
- What?
 - Just follow me.

642
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,145
- Okay, but keep an eye out,

643
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,547
'cause this place is
 crawling with spiders.

644
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:19,951
- Come on!

645
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,423
(suspenseful music)

646
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,468
- One, two, three, push, push!

647
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:38,136
(engine rumbling)

648
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,771
Come on, put some nuts into it!

649
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,174
- Coach, it's no good,
 it's really stuck!

650
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,078
- Tammy, you take the wheel.

651
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,481
You know what, maybe we
need to shift the weight

652
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,583
to the back of the
bus, so get back there.

653
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,660
Alright, go, go.

654
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,065
You're supposed to push
the gas when I say go.

655
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:09,901
- What?

656
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,540
(suspenseful music)

657
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,557
- Hey, Petra, what's up, girl?

658
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:32,858
Come out on the water!

659
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:38,764
- Hi.
(distant hip hop music)

660
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,769
(ominous music)

661
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,040
- [Dad] Make yourself useful

662
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,309
and get some water
 for these folks.

663
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,209
- Can you save the
 attitude, please?

664
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,552
- My wife and want
 a full refund.

665
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,754
This is by far the worst
vacation we've ever had.

666
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,624
- Yeah, your brochure didn't
 say anything about spiders.

667
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,459
- Well my ma'am, it does
 actually say in the fine print

668
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,695
that we're not responsible
 for local wildlife.

669
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:12,063
See, it's right there.

670
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,499
- Forget what the
 brochure said, okay?

671
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:16,435
And you're not gonna
 talk to my wife that way.

672
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,837
Let me tell you something,
 playboy, I'm from the hood.

673
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,273
I've done and seen things
 you have nightmares about.

674
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,508
You understand?
- Baby stop it.

675
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:23,742
Just let it go.

676
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,843
- No, no they need
 to hear this, baby.

677
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,044
- Let it go.
 - This is ridiculous!

678
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,178
We didn't sign up for this.
 - Babe!

679
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,614
- Spiders everywhere,
 this is crazy.

680
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,981
Let me tell you something.

681
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,684
Forget what the old man
said about Iwo Jima.

682
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,786
That was a cakewalk
 compared to this.

683
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,655
I'm not gonna let
 some bust ass spider

684
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,790
ruin our vacation, okay?

685
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,726
So strap on the cup and buck up.

686
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:44,229
If you wanna survive this thing
we have to stick together.

687
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:49,234
(spider chattering)
 (Glen screaming)

688
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,970
- Everybody back to the boat!

689
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,640
(all screaming)

690
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,511
- Please.
- You gotta let him go,

691
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:00,312
come on.

692
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:08,920

693
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,795
(gun firing)

694
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,565

699
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,385
(engine rumbling)

700
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,024
- Alright, come on girls,
 you're up, hurry up.

701
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:48,660
Come on, come on!

702
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:54,400
- What is it?
- I don't know.

703
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,705
- What the hell is it?

704
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,507
(spider hissing)
- Oh, God.

705
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:05,577
- Oh, my God!
(all screaming)

706
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:08,580
- Oh, my God, run, hurry, go!
 - Guys!

707
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,520
(spider chattering)

708
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,090
- Hit him, Coach!

709
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,061
Seriously?

710
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,165
(Coach whimpering)

711
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:34,506
(bat thuds)
(spider screams)

00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:41,413
(spider explodes)
 (Coach laughs)

713
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,848
- [Coach] Now, that is why

714
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,016
you were my number
 one pinch hitter!

715
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,718
Whoo!

716
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:52,390
(melancholy music)

717
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,072
- Breathe deep.

718
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,075
- Hey, what are you doing?

719
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,677
Nobody touches
 that stuff but me.

720
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,378
- She's having an
 asthma attack, Pops.

721
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,814
I figured these heliox
 would help, it's your call.

722
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,015
- [Justin] Keep breathing, Mom.

723
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,519
- Better?
 - Thank you.

724
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:23,388
I'm gonna be okay.

725
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,225
- Hey, good job, brother.

726
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,426
- It's all part of
 the tour package.

727
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,596
- So, where do you
think the spider is now?

728
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:35,000
(suspenseful music)

729
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,370
(girls sobbing)

730
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,517
- Coach.
(Coach screams)

731
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:52,918
- Crap.

732
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,285
- Those things breathe fire.

733
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,726
- Well, hey, as long as we
 stay in here we'll be okay.

734
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,531
(girl sobbing)

735
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,198
Come on, come on, you
guys are gonna be fine,

736
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,535
as long as you
 stay calm and hey,

737
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,637
stay away from those
windows, we'll be fine.

738
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,640
Okay, we'll be alright.

739
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,645
(ominous music)
 (spider chattering)

740
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,785
(suspenseful music)

741
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,459
(boat rumbling)

742
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,435
- Is it abandoned?

743
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,239
Dad, is it abandoned?

744
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:53,812
- Unfortunately not.

745
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,380
- They can't see us, can they?

746
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,347
- They can hear us.

747
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,949
Everybody be quiet.

748
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,722
- [Tina] What are
 you stopping for?

749
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:07,525
- Tina, calm down.
 - No, no.

750
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,964
No, he knows we're here.

751
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:16,367
(Tina whimpering)
 No, no.

752

(Tina spazzing)

754
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:26,377
- We're gonna get outta here.
 - No, no we're not.

755
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,847
They're gonna get us
just like they got Glen!

756
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,249
They're gonna get us,
 they're gonna get us!

757
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,586
(Tina sobbing)

758
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:35,520

(Tina screaming)

760
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:49,500
No, no, no, they're gonna get
 us just like they ate Glen!

761
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,870
- [Petra] What are you doing?

762
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,904
- No, no, no!

763
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,608
- What are you,
 get, get, get off!

764
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,577
(engine roars)
 - No!

765
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:04,015
- Hold on, Petra.
 - Alright, beat it.

766
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,385
- I'm not gonna let you go!
 (Tina screaming)

767
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,354
- I'm not gonna let
 you go, you hear me?

768
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,222
Look at me, I'm not
 gonna let you go!

769
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:16,227
(Petra screaming)
 I'm not gonna let you go.

770
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,297
- They can do that too?
- Get back here, now!

771
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:20,732
- No, no, please!

772
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,068
- I'm not gonna let you go.

773
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,269
Look at me!

774
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,038
Come on, come on, I've got you.

775
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,273
Come on.

776
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,109
(Petra shrieking)

777
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,949
(gun firing)

778
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,284
- [Tina] No, no!

779
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,954
- Come on!

780
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:47,592
(spiders hissing)

781
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:50,628
- Let go.

782
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,800
- Hold on.

783
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,633
Get!

784
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:59,470
(Petra sighs)

785
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,040
(boat rumbling)

786
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,578
(Tina groaning)

787
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:15,486
(boat thuds)
 (Tina screams)

788
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,091
Abandon ship!

789
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,260
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

790
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,263
(suspenseful music)

791
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,542
- Come on, right over here.

792
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,080
- Tina, are you alive?
 - I'm okay.

793
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,824
(Tina shrieks)

794
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:58,897

(Tina screaming)

796
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,114
- Don't move.

797
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,715
Don't even breathe.

798
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,626
- Here.

799
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,028
Take care of the others,
I'll distract them.

800
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,797
- What me?
 - Look, you can do it.

801
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:33,431
I have faith in you, son.

802
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,001
- No, Pops.
 - It's our only hope!

803
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,871
(spiders growling)

804
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:46,111
(suspenseful music)

805
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,420
- Hey, Moby Dick, hey.

806
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,391
You, over here.
(spider shrieks)

807
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,829
(dramatic music)

808
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,545
(Dad groans)

809
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:30,088
(spider chattering)

810
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,029
(fire roaring)

811
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,332
- Dad!
- Pops!

812
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,267
Pops!
 - Dad!

813
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,975
- Pops!
 - Oh, my God, Dad!

814
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:55,180
Dad.
 (Dad groans)

815
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,051
(spider chattering)
 - Behind you.

816
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,653
(Petra screams)

817
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,827
(alligator growls)

818
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,698
Nobody messes with Mama.

819
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,600
- Come on, man, let's
 get you outta here.

820
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,635
(Dad groans)

821
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,972
(swamp life chattering)

822
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:26,878
(girl sobbing)
 (spiders chattering)

823
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,585
(banging on bus)

824
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,103
- Hey, you hear that?

825
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,372
- It's almost like they're
 talking to each other.

826
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,840
- No, no, it sounds
 like a truck.

827
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:08,253
(bang echoes)

828
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:09,454
What the hell?

829
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,957
(guns firing)

830
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:36,881
(dramatic music)
(gasps)

831
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,216
- Tammy!
- Daddy?

832
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,188
Daddy!
 - Oh, baby.

833
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:44,389
Baby, you're okay.

834
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:45,490
Oh, okay.

835
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,133
(Charlie screaming)

836
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:09,347
- Now that is how you
 make jambalaya, yeah!

837
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:12,650
What?

838
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,256
(majestic music)

839
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:20,391
- [Petra] It's
 gonna be okay, Dad.

840
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,060
We're gonna get you some help.

841
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,461
- Pops, just gimme an
 arm, let me help you.

842
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,696
- It's okay, son, I got it.

843
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:33,504
(ominous music)

844
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,341
(bushes rustling)

845
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,814
- Did you hear that?

846
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:49,754
- Yeah.
(birds chirping)

847
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,825
(ominous music)

848
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,910
(footsteps rustling)

849
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,579
- Whoa, don't shoot!

850
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:16,614
Don't shoot!

851
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,229
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

852
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:34,832
- The name is Jean
 Jacques, this is my bayou.

853
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:37,902
I don't like outsiders, I don't
care how many legs you got.

854
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:40,071
- Whatever happened to
 Southern hospitality?

855
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,807
- We got an injured man here,
 my father, he needs help.

856
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,355
- Those things do that to you?

857
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:58,523
- Yeah, they breathe fire.

858
00:50:58,523 --> 00:50:59,990
- See, I told you.

859
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,459
You don't go skinny dipping
 with snapping turtles.

860
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,229
- How are you still alive?

861
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:06,697
- Don't.

862
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,002
- Okay, follow me.

863
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,607
(suspenseful music)

864
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:26,884
- What, ow!

865
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,721
- Grab the medical kit, we're
 gonna put him in the barn.

866
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:31,956
- Yes, boss.

867
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,124
- We need to get him
 back to the city.

868
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:34,625
- That ain't gonna happen.

869
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,195
- Radio said National Guard
 is setting up a safe zone.

870
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,796
- Yeah, and there could
be 1000 of those things

871
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,165
between here and there.

872
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:42,667
You wanna take that chance?
 - We have to try.

873
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,635
- There's gotta be
 something we can do.

874
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,036
I mean, these things have
 to have a weakness, right?

875
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,738
Something we can use
 to get past them.

876
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:49,240
- He's right.

877
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,142
If I can get my hands
on one of those things,

878
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:54,945
I can dissect it, and maybe
 we can find that weakness.

879
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,814
- You wanna try and capture
 one of those things?

880
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,617
- It doesn't have to be
 alive, just in one piece.

881
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:03,188
Kindaú.
 - Okay, let's hear your plan.

882
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,193
(suspenseful music)
- Does that thing work?

883
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,464
(radio squelching)

884
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,401
- I tried to call you, but
 when I couldn't get through,

885
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,569
I just--
 - Baby, it's okay.

886
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,905
It's alright, I understand,
 you're gonna be fine now.

887
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:23,308
- Girl, slide on down.
 - Sir, hi.

888
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:26,311
I'm Charlie Blackwell,
 I'm the coach.

889
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,845
- Coach Blackwell, of course.

890
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,114
We're gonna get you and the
 girls back to Houston pronto.

891
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:32,450
As a matter of fact, why
don't you ride up front.

892
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,953
- No, listen, my wife and
 kids are in New Orleans.

893
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:37,188
- New Orleans, listen,

894
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:38,356
I've got orders to
 secure the perimeter

895
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:39,524
and keep all the
 civilians outta there.

896
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:40,991
- No, you don't understand.
 - No.

897
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,593
- Listen to me.
- You don't understand.

898
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:46,163
- Daddy, if it weren't for
 him, we wouldn't have made it.

899
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:50,868
- Please.
 - Fine, you can ride with me.

900
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:53,271
You, go straight home.

901
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,973
(truck rumbling)

902
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,778
(suspenseful music)

903
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:11,389
(spider chattering)

904
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:18,596
(people chattering)
 (Mariachi music)

905
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,615
(spider squealing)

906
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:49,527
(suspenseful music)

907
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,942
- You got one.
 - Yep, pretty big one.

908
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,651
- Anyone have a knife?
 - Use this.

909
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:15,386
- That'll do.

910
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:19,990
Alright, here we go.

911
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,660
(ominous music)

912
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,936
Okay, can you hold this?

913
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,204
- Aren't I supposed to
use gloves or something?

914
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,006
- [Boss] Do like
 your mama told you.

915
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,451
- These are the vocal cords,

916
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:49,086
very well developed
 as one might expect.

917
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,325
- What's that
 plum-looking thing?

918
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:56,594
- Well, let's find out.

919
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:00,297
- Oof!
- Nasty!

920
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,667
- Yes, bladder.

921
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,034
- Fuel supply for
 the flamethrower.

922
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,536
- [Katelynn] That
 would be my guess.

923
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,705
- You know, the shale layer
 around here is full of biogas.

924
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:09,574
- Well, the species
 evolved there.

925
00:55:09,574 --> 00:55:14,345
That wouldn't be a surprise
 if they adapted to utilize it.

926
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,347
- Alright, so what are
 they doing here now?

927
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:18,549
- [Katelynn] My guess,
 their habitat was disturbed.

928
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,050
- [Petra] By what?

929
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,586
- Oil companies down here,
 they fracture the earth

930
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,921
to get at the fossil fuels,
 it's called fracking.

931
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,990
- You mean, humans did this?

932
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,425
Typical.

933
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:28,893
- Says here that fracking
 causes earthquakes.

934
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,428
Maybe the spiders
 dug their holes

935
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:32,296
and the fracking started
a chain reaction.

936
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,031
- You running iOS 5?
 - Yeah.

937
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,266
- All I know is, you're
digging around enough,

938
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,302
you could destabilize
 the sediment.

939
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:41,406
- I'm gonna destabilize if I
see another one of those things

940
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:44,208
- [Paul] Alright, so what
 are they doing here now?

941
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,710
- I bet if you boil
 them spider legs

942
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,144
and dip them in some
 butter and some hot sauce.

943
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:47,978
Mmm, whoo!

944
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,048
It just seems like a waste.

945
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,217
You know how in other
countries they eat grasshoppers

946
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:54,452
and scorpions and
 crickets and such.

947
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:55,720
- You been sniffing
 the turpentine again?

948
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,954
- No!

949
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:57,922
- I'm gonna tell
 you this one time.

950
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,356
Lay off the 'shine.

951
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,158
- We ain't got no more 'shine,
 'cause he drank it all.

952
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,493
- Well, you're the one that
 brought it all out here.

953
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:03,994
- Boss asked me too.

954
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,295
- Boss didn't say that, he
 said bring the medical kit.

955
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,564
You brought the medicine.

956
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,637
Box of rocks.

957
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,507
- This is a ovipositor.
- An ovi what?

958
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:19,076
- Egg layer, remember the
 clerk at the gas station?

959
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:22,179
Well, I think this species

960
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,949
incubates its young
 inside a living host,

961
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,383
and it needs
 something really sharp

962
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,920
to get through all
 that bone and skin.

963
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,789
Okay, alright now
 that's strange.

964
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:34,224
The nervous system is
 really rudimentary,

965
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,493
even for an arachnid.

966
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,496
I can't even find a brain.

967
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,798
All I can see is a
 whole bunch of ganglia

968
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,267
for the motor control.
 - So, they're not too smart.

969
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,101
That's a relief.

970
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,373
- They're coming, they're
 coming, they're coming.

971
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:52,376
(suspenseful music)

972
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:58,516
(guns firing)
(dramatic music)

973
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,552
(spiders hissing)

974
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,437
- Guillaume!

975
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:37,054
(fire roaring)
 (Guillaume screaming)

976
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,102
Box of rocks.

977
00:57:56,574 --> 00:58:01,512
(spider chattering)
 (man whimpering)

978
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,919
(dramatic music)

979
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,237
(groans)

980
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:35,145
(suspenseful music)

981
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,586
- How you doing
 back there, Pops?

982
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:43,187
- Oh, decent.

983
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:44,388
I'm right behind you.

984
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:59,236
(dramatic music)
(gun firing)

985
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,510
- [Justin] What do we
 do, she can't breathe!

986
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,912
Breathe, breathe.

987
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:16,253
(spiders growling)

988
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:21,258
(gun firing)
 (Justin whimpers)

989
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,996
(dramatic music)

990
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:36,206
(ominous music)

991
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,414
(Katelynn screams)

992
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,783
- Mom!
 (gun firing)

993
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,785
- Let her go!
 - Mom, Mom!

994
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:51,055
- No, no no.
 - Annabelle!

995
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,058
- You can't do
 nothing, come on boy.

996
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:58,495
- [Justin] Annabelle!

997
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,398
- No.
 - Where's Dad, Dad?

998
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,366
Dad!
- Wait.

999
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:06,036
- Dad?
- Wait here, wait here!

1000
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:13,678
(spider chattering)

1001
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,051
(suspenseful music)

1002
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:50,647
(spider chattering)
 (Dad groaning)

1003
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:57,287
- Pops, Pops, easy, easy.

1004
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,089
Pops, easy, it's me.

1005
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,791
It's me, Pops,
 it's me, I got you.

1006
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:02,026
I got you.

1007
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,660
Come on, we gotta
 get Petra back.

1008
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,494
We gotta get Petra back.

1009
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,096
Come on, there you go.

1010
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:12,136
(Dad screaming)
 I know I know, just come on.

1011
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:16,841
- Okay, listen to me.
 - No no.

1012
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,342
Save your breath, Pops.

1013
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,410
- You've been a pain in
 my ass most of your life,

1014
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,180
and I've been hard
 on you 'cause,

1015
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,750
'cause you, when you needed it.

1016
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,755
I realize now that
 I have been trying

1017
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:32,857
to fit round peg
 into a square hole.

1018
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,726
There's no...

1019
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,295
You're not me.

1020
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,832
That's okay, you're
 still my son.

1021
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:46,170
And take Petra, and you
 get her to the safe zone,

1022
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,738
'cause it's your only chance.

1023
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:51,308
- Pops, we're all gonna get
 to the safe zone, all of us.

1024
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:52,109
Come on.

1025
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,513
No.

1026
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,715
Pops, they got Petra.

1027
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,386
- No.
 - Pops, Pops.

1028
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:04,688
Hey, hey.

1029
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,725
I'm gonna get her
 back, Pops, okay?

1030
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:10,527
- That's my boy.

1031
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,766
(Dad groans)

1032
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,970
- Dad, Dad...

1033
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,141
(somber music)

1034
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:41,625
- Your father?

1035
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,531
You gonna need this.

1036
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,570
- Where's everybody else?

1037
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,640
- Annabelle, she went after Mom.

1038
01:02:57,975 --> 01:02:59,877
- [Paul] Get him back
 to the safe zone?

1039
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,480
- [Jack] Boy, follow me.

1040
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:22,366
- What are you gonna do?

1041
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:24,701
- I'm gonna save them.

1042
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,704
(suspenseful music)

1043
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:37,247
(ominous music)

1044
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:44,221
(water splashing)

1045
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,067
- Annabelle!

1046
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:02,606
(suspenseful music)

1047
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,201
Annabelle!

1048
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:43,713
(ominous music)

1049
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,987
(spiders chattering)

1050
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:03,934
(Paul groaning)

1051
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,407
(ominous music)

1052
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,432
(spiders chattering)

1053
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:58,422
Petra, come on.

1054
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:02,192
Oh God.

1055
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,832
- [Petra] Thank you.

1056
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:11,168
- Alright, come on, come on.

1057
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,504
Let's go.

1058
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:17,474
- How's Dad?

1059
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:19,976
Paul!

1060
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:23,380
Paul?

1061
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:33,190
- He's gone.
 - No.

1062
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,928
No!
 - I'm sorry.

1063
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,598
He made me promise that I
 was gonna get you outta here.

1064
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:46,536
Don't make a liar
 outta me, okay?

1065
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:49,673
(distant coughing)

1066
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:50,907
Come on.
- Okay.

1067
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:55,245
(ominous music)

1068
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,652
(spider chattering)

1069
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,125
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1070
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:10,860
- Shh, shh!

1071
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:15,265
- Do you see her?
 - Her?

1072
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:27,511
- The queen, she's the
 brain for all of them.

1073
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:31,315
They're completely
 dependent on her.

1074
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:34,151
Kill her, they won't
 be able to function.

1075
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:36,453
They'll all die.

1076
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:39,989
- You, you guys, uh...

1077
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:52,836
(spider growls)
(all screaming)

1078
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,474
- Come on, this way!
 - Come on, Mom.

1079
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:58,542
- [Paul] There's a
 way out, guys come on.

1080
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,810
- [Annabelle] This way, Mom.

1081
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:04,781
- Come on, you got it?

1082
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,084
Go, go, go!

1083
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,688
(dramatic music)

1084
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,927
(spiders screaming)

1085
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:29,406
- Go.
 - Ugh!

1086
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,281
- Petra, I'm gonna
need you up at the top.

1087
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,717
I'm gonna push.
 (spider screaming)

1088
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:54,264
(computer beeping)

1089
01:08:58,202 --> 01:09:00,804
(Paul groaning)

1090
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,013
(tree crashes)

1091
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:13,750
(Paul breathing heavily)

1092
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:18,755
(Paul groaning)
(dramatic music)

1093
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:34,638
(trees crunching)

1094
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:40,477
(melancholy music)

1095
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,193
- Hey, that's my Dad!

1096
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,996
Dad!
 - Oh my God, son!

1097
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,665
Oh, oh man.

1098
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,703
- [Justin] Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

1099
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,805
- I'm gonna need to
confiscate that weapon.

1100
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:10,173
- This my gun.

1101
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,242
- I was worried about
you, where's the others?

1102
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:14,778
- The spiders, they took Mom.

1103
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:16,045
- What, who did?

1104
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:16,980
- Her asthma, she
 couldn't breathe,

1105
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,014
and the spiders they took her.

1106
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:19,983
- Wait, the spiders took Mom?

1107
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:20,817
- Yes.

1108
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:22,952
- Where's Annabelle?

1109
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,389
- She went after them,
I, I couldn't stop her.

1110
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,690
- Say again, Zulu Six?

1111
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:31,094
This keeps getting
 better and better.

1112
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:33,062
We got a problem, a big one.

1113
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:39,202
(suspenseful music)

1114
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:42,339
(helicopter rumbling)

1115
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,974
- Is she coming?
- Yeah.

1116
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,142
And she ain't too happy.

1117
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,180
(missiles firing)

1118
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,549
- Yes, whoo, yes!

1119
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:55,018
Mom, Mom!

1120
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,389
Look, Mom, the helicopters,
 Mom, they're here.

1121
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,291
Mom, they're coming.

1122
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,125
- I, uh...

1123
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,595
(Mom gasping)

1124
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:18,508
- Mom?

1125
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:21,411
Mom.

1126
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:23,347
Mom, Mom!

1127
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,687
(dramatic music)
- On me!

1128
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,426
Listen up, I want
 that thing stopped

1129
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,595
before it reaches
 the city, understand?

1130
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,597
Failure is not an option.

1131
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:41,965
- Oo-rah!
 - Look!

1132
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,534
- That is a big mother bugger.

1133
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,107
- That's Paul.
 - Who's Paul?

1134
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:52,742
- Our tour guide.
 - Tour guy?

1135
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:57,747
(spider growling)

1136
01:11:57,747 --> 01:12:00,450
(dramatic music)

1137
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,593
(guns firing)

1138
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:15,098
(fire roaring)

1139
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,340
- She's on the move.

1140
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:30,246
(spider screeching)
 (car alarms wailing)

1141
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:35,585
(dramatic music)

1142
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,227
- [Pilot] Major Crandle, I
 have a visual on the target.

1143
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:45,228
- You think?

1144
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:50,333
(people screaming)

1145
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,272
(spider screeching)

1146
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:06,850
- What's she doing?
 - She's feathering her nest.

1147
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:11,054
(dramatic music)

1148
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,797
- [Pilot] I have
 target locked, sir.

1149
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:21,831
Fire on your command.

1150
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,668
- Hold your fire, Zulu Six,

1151
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:27,303
we've got civilians
 in that building.

1152
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:28,972
(suspenseful music)

1153
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:30,474
- One, two, three!

1154
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:36,145
One, two...

1155
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:40,049
Mom, mom!

1156
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,323
- [Petra] What are we gonna do?

1157
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:48,357
- Katelynn said if
 we kill the queen,

1158
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:49,959
it'll stop them all, right?

1159
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,529
- Well, we don't even
 know if that'll work.

1160
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:54,698
- We have to try.
 - Hello, Paul.

1161
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:56,432
Missiles won't even stop her.

1162
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,568
- These things are only
tough on the outside.

1163
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,435
We have to go in.

1164
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,005
- What are you gonna do?

1165
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:07,343
- I'm gonna prove
 your mother right.

1166
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,211
- How can I help?

1167
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,649
(dramatic music)

1168
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:22,926
This is all I could find.
 - Perfect.

1169
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,862
- At the risk of
 stating the obvious,

1170
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:28,164
I want you to know I
 think this is a bad idea.

1171
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:30,166
- Duly noted.

1172
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,138
- But whatever happens,
I believe in you.

1173
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,372
- [Paul] Really?

1174
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:38,007
- Nah, I'm just
 messing with you.

1175
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,911
(epic music)

1176
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:13,309
(gun firing)

1177
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:25,454
- Hey, that's
Annabelle, she made it!

1178
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,522
- Oh, my God!

1179
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:31,427
- [Charlie] Major Crandle!

1180
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:32,328
My daughter, she's down there.

1181
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:33,529
You guys gotta help her.

1182
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,737
- [Crandle] Bravo team,

1183
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:43,206
we've got civilians on
 Iberville and Decatur,

1184
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,041
Iberville and Decatur.

1185
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,109
Roger, out.

1186
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,511
- Time to show daddy long legs

1187
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:49,913
how we roll on the bayou.

1188
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:56,485
- Where the hell is he going?

1189
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,922
(epic music)

1190
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,831
(sirens wailing)

1191
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:14,804
- Let's get her in the back.

1192
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,115
- [Annabelle] No, no
 please, let me go with her!

1193
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,483
- You are not going.

1194
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:29,653
Gentlemen, take this lady.

1195
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:32,622
- [Justin] Annabelle!

1196
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:36,693
- Justin!

1197
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:53,276
(people screaming)
 (dramatic music)

1198
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,353
(gun firing)

1199
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,557
(tires squealing)

1200
01:17:14,597 --> 01:17:17,266
- Who was that?
 - That Cajun dude.

1201
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:22,772
(sirens wailing)

1202
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:25,174
(gun firing)

1203
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:35,584
(guns firing)

1204
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:51,634
- Annabelle!
 - Dad!

1205
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,538
- How's Mom?
 - Her asthma.

1206
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:56,505
She didn't make it.

1207
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:08,985
(guns firing)

1208
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:21,597
(spider screaming)
 (dramatic music)

1209
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,136
- You going fishing?

1210
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:28,772
- [Paul] Yeah,
 wanna be the bait?

1211
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:34,778
- We come to say hello.

1212
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:37,380
Time to dance, you
 big beautiful bitch!

1213
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:41,517
(bazooka firing)

1214
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:44,587
(missile exploding)

1215
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:47,490
(spider screaming)

1216
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:59,769
(Jack groans)
- Woah, woah, woah,hey!

1217
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:00,904
Woah, come on right here.

1218
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,206
Come on, right here, get me!

1219
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:06,442
Uh-oh.

1220
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:10,513
(Paul screaming)

1221
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:14,050
- Can I see through
 the binoculars?

1222
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,518
That's my brother, please.

1223
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:22,091
(spider screams)

1224
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,292
- It's not much of a safe zone.

1225
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:27,196
- Ugh, I'm stuck.
 - You need some help?

1226
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:29,332
I'm kinda busy right now.

1227
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,934
You'll help yourselves.

1228
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,969
- [Paul] I just gotta get loose.

1229
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:37,974
She's coming back.
 (dramatic music)

1230
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:43,279
- Don't start what
 you can't finish, boy.

1231
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,347
You hear me?
 - No.

1232
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:51,888
(spider screeches)
 (Jack screaming)

1233
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:57,927
(suspenseful music)

1234
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,134
(spider chattering)

1235
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:12,475
- [Paul] Ugh!

1236
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:16,846
Ugh!

1237
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:19,048
- Aw, man, he did not
 just do that, did he?

1238
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:20,216
- Ugh, I can't look.

1239
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:25,254
(Paul groaning)

1240
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:37,400
- The guy has got guts.

1241
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,368
- Yeah, in more ways than one.

1242
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:45,208
(gun firing)

1243
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,677
- [Paul] Where is
 it, where is it?

1244
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,046
There it is, ugh!

1245
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,316
- Gas bladder, he's going
 for the gas bladder.

1246
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:58,888
(spider farts)
 (Paul screams)

1247
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:02,358
(Paul whimpering)

1248
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,759
- [Paul] Come on.

1249
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:09,498
(spider screeches)

1250
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:22,645
Come on!

1251
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,184
This one is for you, Dad.

1252
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:38,627
Ooh!
 (explosion echoes)

1253
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,206
(spider screeching)

1254
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:54,677
(melancholy music)

1255
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:58,281
- Get a squad over
 there double time

1256
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,549
and make sure every part
of that thing is dead.

1257
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:03,452
Say again, Echo One?

1258
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,222
I need visual confirmation.

1259
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:07,423
Do you have eyes on?

1260
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:10,994
Outstanding.

1261
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:15,398
They're dying, all over the
 city the spiders are dying.

1262
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:16,632
Oo-rah!
 - Oo-rah!

1263
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,735
- Oh, Dad!
 - Yeah!

1264
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:25,874
(siren wailing)

1265
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,396
- Did you know that man?

1266
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:51,534
I'm sorry.

1267
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:53,402
Listen, I'm gonna see
to it that he's awarded

1268
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,905
the highest commendation the
 military can offer a civilian.

1269
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:58,141
You have my word on that.

1270
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:02,378
Wait a minute, is that...

1271
01:23:09,385 --> 01:23:10,219
- Paul!

1272
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:21,064
- Team Bravo, somebody
get him down from there.

1273
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:26,969
- Little help?

1274
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:31,074
(dramatic music)

1275
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:55,231
(serene music)

1276
01:23:58,434 --> 01:24:01,437
(spider screams)

1277
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:02,871
(lively music)

1278
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:07,876
* Left my home in
search of another life *

1279
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:13,048
* But all I found
 was how to get lost *

1280
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:18,854
* Maybe tomorrow will
 be a brighter day *

1281
01:24:19,622 --> 01:24:22,325
* But I don't think so

1282
01:24:22,325 --> 01:24:25,294
* 'Cause I got a
 bad bad feeling *

1283
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,796
* Got a bad bad feeling

1284
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:32,468
* I got a bad bad feeling

1285
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:37,473
* It's always
 gonna be that way *

1286
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:42,178
* I headed down

1287
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:45,448
* To where the water is warm

1288
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:50,453
* Hoping to find
 a place to rest *

1289
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,556
* But I got chased out

1290
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:55,724
* 'Cause I couldn't pay

1291
01:24:55,724 --> 01:25:00,696
* And I guess that it's
 always gonna be that way *

1292
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:04,233
* I wish that I

1293
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:07,570
* Had someone to love

1294
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,538
* Someone to talk to

1295
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:14,042
* Someone to hold

1296
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,512
* But I got nobody

1297
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:18,514
* And I suppose it's okay

1298
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:23,519
* 'Cause I guess that it's
 always gonna be that way *

1299
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:30,058
* I left my home in
search of another life *

1300
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:35,231
* But all I found
 was how to get lost *

1301
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:40,936
* Maybe tomorrow will
 be a brighter day *

1302
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:44,573
* But I don't think so

1303
01:25:44,573 --> 01:25:47,443
* 'Cause I got a
 bad bad feeling *

1304
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:50,012
* Got a bad bad feeling

1305
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:54,683
* I got a bad bad feeling

1306
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:58,687
* It's always
 gonna be that way *

1307
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,616
* Well I just met a woman

1308
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:31,220
* Prettier than the Sun

1309
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:36,225
* And she says
 that she loves me *

1310
01:26:37,893 --> 01:26:42,898
* I never thought that
 I'd ever see the day *

1311
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:46,269
* When somebody loves me

1312
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:48,036
* And somebody wants me

1313
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:52,408
* And I pray-ay-ay hey

1314
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:56,144
* It's always
 gonna be that way *

1315
01:26:56,144 --> 01:27:01,083
* And I pray-ay-ay hey

1316
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:05,087
* It's always
 gonna be that way *
