1
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,756
Would you bring me a Coke please?

2
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,988
- Of course. Only a Coke?
- No, with ice.

3
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,944
Here's your drink.

4
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,376
Thank you.

5
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,746
I don't have change.

6
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,922
Don't tell me.
Don't you have something smaller?

7
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,613
No, that's all I have.

8
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,622
Well, what am I going to do then?

9
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,085
You're going to leave me broke.
Take it.

10
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:54,963
You're leaving me broke here.

11
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,528
So quickly?

12
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,761
Thank you very much.

13
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:04,033
Wait, wait. I have
change from the taxi.

14
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,310
If it's no trouble, maybe it would
be better... I'll give you this.

15
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,216
$ 50, no?

16
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,749
$ 50 and the $ 50 that I already
gave you, that's $ 100.

17
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,750
So if you give me $ 100, we'll be even.

18
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:19,887
I give $ 100 to you?

19
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,319
The $ 100 bill for the change.

20
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,959
Okay. Take it.

21
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,613
What kind?

22
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,219
Lights.

23
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,301
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

24
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,308
I just need security here.

25
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,844
Security. I need security.

26
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:22,414
I already give you your change.
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

27
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,816
- You're trying to rip me off.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

28
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,652
- I'm a police officer. What's the problem?
- He's trying to rip me off.

29
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,590
- Sorry, I was trying to buy cigarettes...
- Be quiet.

30
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,457
I'll get to you in a minute.

31
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,122
- Now, ma'am, what is your name?
- Dolores.

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,292
Hey, L.A.P.D. Vice. I got this. Okay?

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,564
Okay, Dolores. Calm down
and tell me exactly what happened.

34
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,208
He asked me for cigarettes.
He gave me a $ 50.

35
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,243
Now he says he gave me $ 100.
He's trying to rip me off.

36
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,778
- Okay. Is that true?
- No. It's not true.

37
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:54,746
I was just buying cigarettes.
Then she start to shout.

38
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,318
- I don't know what's going on.
- You know what?

39
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,045
This seems a little familiar.

40
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:02,453
Maybe we should talk to the waitress
you bought the Coke from.

41
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,115
Should we do that?

42
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,753
Officer, would you mind asking
that waitress to come over?

43
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,058
Now, what is your name?

44
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,596
What's your name?

45
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,800
Get over here.

46
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:17,968
Don't make it hard.

47
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,506
Just relax.

48
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,372
Calm down. Slow down.

49
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,507
All right. What's your problem?

50
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,843
You been doing some drugs?
You high today?

51
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,281
9:30 in the morning,
and you're high.

52
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,852
- Dolores, you okay?
- Fine.

53
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,651
All right. You stay right here. I'm gonna
need a statement from you. Let's go.

54
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,133
Keep her there, okay?
I'll be right back.

55
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,205
Right here.

56
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,716
Stand against the car.

57
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,882
- What's going on?
- Just relax.

58
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,532
All right. Get in.

59
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,837
I'm not a cop. Get in.
I'll drop you off.

60
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,180
No tricks, all right? You wanna learn
what you were trying to do?

61
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:34,475
- I never thought about it.
- Well, you ought to start.

62
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,017
- You know what? I'm okay.
- You don't know what you don't know.

63
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,987
Unless it was part of your plan
to get pinched and beaten for $ 45.

64
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:46,527
Listen, they got security cameras
on us now. You want a ride or not?

65
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,525
Okay.

66
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,474
So you know what I do, right?

67
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,846
I usually work with another guy.
My partner, a Jew.

68
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,922
Disappeared a week ago,
and no idea where he is, so...

69
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,525
...I gotta find a new partner.

70
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,024
Why me?

71
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:20,924
I can't do what I do alone.

72
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,997
You can only go so far by yourself.

73
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,930
You can survive,
but if you want more than that...

74
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:29,765
...you gotta work with someone.
And I got a lifestyle to support.

75
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,141
Look, I don't wanna be your friend,
okay?

76
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,301
I'll tell you that right off the bat.
This is work.

77
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,447
So if I ask you personal questions...

78
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:42,141
...it's because the more I know,
the more I can develop your role.

79
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,252
- You understand?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,389
- You speak good English?
- Yeah. Pretty good.

81
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,825
All right, so, what's your name?

82
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,393
- Rodrigo.
- What?

83
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,259
- Rodrigo.
- No.

84
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,731
No, we gotta Anglo you up a little.

85
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,199
- Brian.
- Brian?

86
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,101
Yeah, Brian.

87
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,539
- What's your name?
- Richard.

88
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,769
Richard Gaddis.

89
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,257
- Is it up here?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:25,792
Here.

91
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,958
Nice color.

92
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,166
Yeah.

93
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:33,999
So how about this.

94
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,728
You give me a couple hours...

95
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,396
...I show you some basics,
get you warmed up.

96
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,971
If it works out,
we'll kick it up a notch.

97
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,078
You hate it, you walk.

98
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,377
I hate you, you walk.
Nobody gets hurt.

99
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,816
- Okay.
- Yeah?

100
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,957
- Yeah.
- All right.

101
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,231
Look. It's my experience
people are more likely to give money...

102
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,460
...to someone who looks like
they already have money. Okay?

103
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:11,038
I walk up to you all decked out,
standing in front of this car...

104
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,902
...I got some kind of emergency.

105
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,705
You know, under normal circumstances,
I don't need anybody's help, right?

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,610
And then there's you
showing up with the same story.

107
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,047
Who you think they'll give
their money to?

108
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,380
In my neighborhood, you'd be dead.

109
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,854
Yeah. Well, that's why we're not
working your neighborhood.

110
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,755
- Ever been to Westwood?
- No.

111
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,786
<i>Hello?</i>

112
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,968
<i>Hello?</i>

113
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,434
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hello? Debbie?</i>

114
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,239
<i>Sorry.</i>

115
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:54,144
<i>- Who is this?</i>
<i>- Sorry. Wrong apartment.</i>

116
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,515
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

117
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,381
<i>Hello?</i>

118
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,657
<i>Hello?</i>

119
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,900
- Grandma?
<i>- Yes?</i>

120
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,430
<i>Who is it?</i>

121
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,736
What, you don't recognize
your favorite grandson?

122
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,899
<i>- Nicholas?</i>
- How are you?

123
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,978
<i>Well, I can't believe it.</i>
<i>It's been so long.</i>

124
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,081
<i>- When did you get to town?</i>
- Oh, I got in last night.

125
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,651
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I hardly recognized your voice.</i>

126
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,322
I know, I'm...
I just got over something.

127
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,618
- But I'm not contagious, don't worry.
<i>- You came to visit me?</i>

128
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:41,422
You'll be mad. I'm with a friend.
We were visiting somebody nearby...

129
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,997
...and my rental car broke down.

130
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,394
<i>- The rental car?</i>
- Yeah.

131
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,798
It's one of those Cooper MINIs.
Seen those?

132
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,530
<i>- A what?</i>
- It's no bigger than your toaster.

133
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:53,834
It's so cute, you'll love it.
Guess what color it is. Guess.

134
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,808
<i>- Turquoise?</i>
- No. I wanted turquoise.

135
00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:00,039
They gave me a blue one.
Cobalt, they call it.

136
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,879
Anyway, the guy is coming to tow
the car back to the rental place...

137
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,921
...and I don't have any money to give him.
I left my wallet at the hotel.

138
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,217
<i>How could you go out</i>
<i>without your wallet?</i>

139
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:13,521
I know. You know me, so stupid.

140
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,221
I am so sorry. This is so embarrassing.

141
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,334
But if you have just $ 100,
it would be a huge help.

142
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:23,233
I'll go back to the hotel, switch the car
and come back with the money.

143
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,306
It'll take 15 minutes.

144
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,470
Okay?

145
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,741
Are you there?

146
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:35,281
<i>If Jerald ever found out about this,</i>
<i>he would absolutely flip.</i>

147
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:37,817
I don't think we should tell Jerald.

148
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,147
<i>Can't you come up for a minute?</i>

149
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,314
I can't. I have to wait with the car.

150
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,551
But I'm with my friend.
If you could give him the money...

151
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,526
His name is Brian.
He's really nice. He's Spanish.

152
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:51,098
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>
- Mexican.

153
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,132
<i>- I'm coming down</i>.
- Okay.

154
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,361
<i>It's okay to leave it with your friend?</i>

155
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,302
Oh, yeah. He's real nice.
He's a friend from school.

156
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:02,877
Grandma, the tow truck is coming.
I gotta go. I have to go.

157
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,189
Hey.

158
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:21,728
- She gave me 200.
- Sweet.

159
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:25,025
And she said you should
give this back to your mother.

160
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,295
Why don't you keep it?
Got a girlfriend? Give it to her.

161
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:33,374
No. I told you,
I'm not, like, a professional crook.

162
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:36,670
- Whatever. You want the ring?
- No, it's not that.

163
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,946
- What is it?
- You know...

164
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,607
You know, the old lady, man.

165
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,879
Oh, I see.
Waitress in a casino, fine.

166
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,148
Trusting old lady, never.

167
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:49,621
Come on.

168
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:54,422
She told me I look like her nephew,
the one who died of blood poisoning.

169
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,358
- Are we still talking about this?
- Yeah.

170
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,798
I don't know, man.
It was weird, that's all.

171
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,939
So why don't you just
go back and confess.

172
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,834
I don't feel anything for them, okay?

173
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,308
They're marks.

174
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,312
And some of them are dumber
than fucking pets.

175
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,918
- You ever been to Beverly Hills?
- No.

176
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,252
It's a great place to work.

177
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,161
All right. So...

178
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,631
...go in here, order a soy latte to go.

179
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,297
Okay.

180
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,804
Pay with this.

181
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:46,539
- Then come find me. All right?
- Cool.

182
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,110
- I need money.
- Yeah, join the club.

183
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:53,949
No, but I need a lot of money.
I need a lot of money now.

184
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,250
- How much?
- A lot.

185
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,325
- How much?
- Seventy.

186
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:02,260
- Seventeen?
- No, 70. 7-0.

187
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,092
For what?

188
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,791
For my old man. He owes it.

189
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,699
- Gambling?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,372
How much do you have?

191
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,907
Thirty-eight.

192
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,706
- Who does he owe it to?
- This guy. This Russian guy.

193
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,444
If I were you, I'd get a new old man.

194
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,713
I gotta do something.
They might kill him.

195
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,292
They probably will. Which is why
you should stay out of it, okay?

196
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,122
Look, I don't wanna hurt anybody.

197
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:37,424
I'm not a violent person.
I've never even seen a gun go off.

198
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,661
That stuff at the casino was choreography.
I was totally in control of that.

199
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,904
Don't get involved with these people.
I'm telling you.

200
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,666
It's my dad.

201
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:49,333
I gotta do something.

202
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:56,042
Personally, I don't get the family thing.
It's like a big fucking circle, you know?

203
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,449
You're like your dad,
and he was like his dad...

204
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:02,489
I fought with my mother,
so now I fight with my sister.

205
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:04,091
It's boring.

206
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,387
You know what
the biggest jerk-off of all is?

207
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:10,225
Beyond family even, because you
can't control your family, is jobs.

208
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,095
I mean, this totally mystifies me.

209
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,067
Can you believe people
actually accept this?

210
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:20,106
It's like you work all day,
people tell you what to do all day long.

211
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,178
You know, and then on top
of taking shit all day, they can fire you.

212
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:28,248
- Well, what did your father do?
- He was an astronaut.

213
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,408
Take off.

214
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,144
- What?
- Take off. Say goodbye.

215
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,585
- Oh, okay.
- I can't believe I ran into you.

216
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:37,021
- Good to see you.
- I'm in a hurry. Gotta go.

217
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:38,557
- Have a good one.
- See you.

218
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,287
Excuse me.
Could I get my change, please?

219
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,592
What change, sir?

220
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,757
The change for the hundred.

221
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,163
What hundred?

222
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:51,065
- I paid you 10 minutes ago with a $ 100 bill.
- Sir, you didn't pay me.

223
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,505
Excuse me, Daniel, maybe you got
too many tables or something.

224
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:57,009
I asked if you could break 100,
you said yes.

225
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,670
- Sir, you're mistaken.
- We're past the "sir" stage.

226
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,748
- I need to see the manager.
- Sir...

227
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,909
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
You understand?

228
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,487
I wanna talk to the manager
and get my change.

229
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,217
- You didn't pay, so don't shout.
- I don't wanna shout, but I'm late.

230
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,590
Now, I wanna see the manager.
Get your boss. Don't be stupid.

231
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:17,789
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, this gentleman says he paid.

232
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,492
- No, I did pay you.
- There seems to be confusion.

233
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,864
No, no confusion.
I had a cup of coffee.

234
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,563
I had two $ 100 bills,
and now I have one.

235
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:28,642
Oh, here. The corner's missing.

236
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:30,676
So it must be missing the corner.

237
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,314
Can you check for a bill
with a corner missing?

238
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,177
- Sir...
- I'm not going anywhere.

239
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,615
Get my change.
I have to get out of here.

240
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,615
I knew that trick.

241
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,381
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

242
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:44,685
- Did you ever try it?
- No.

243
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,350
Why not?

244
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,689
It's too loud.

245
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,092
- What?
- You know...

246
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,256
...you have to make a whole scene.

247
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:53,901
That's the point.

248
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,629
They're not interested
in making a scene.

249
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,272
That's the key, okay?

250
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,034
The more offended you are,
the less suspicious.

251
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,044
If things get sticky,
you blame everybody else.

252
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,205
- Have you been paying attention?
- Yeah.

253
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,817
I just think it's too emotional,
that's all.

254
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,249
This is private.

255
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,152
Hey.

256
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,522
So listen, I've been thinking about it.
Go ahead and file it.

257
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,185
Yeah.

258
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,830
I gotta go.

259
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:26,092
I got somebody here.
I gotta go. Bye.

260
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,703
Who was that?

261
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,197
My lawyer.

262
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,469
Hey, so, what's next?

263
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,779
I don't know.

264
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:40,642
Maybe we should go our own ways.

265
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:44,912
The Jew is gonna come back soon.
He finds out I replaced him, he'll be pissed.

266
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,317
- The Jew gets jealous.
- No, wait.

267
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,719
- Tell me. What is it?
- You're not into it.

268
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:54,022
You're distracted or something. Maybe this
shit with your father, I don't know.

269
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:55,857
You'll fuck something up.

270
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,124
What could I fuck up?

271
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,927
You think too much.

272
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,469
I think too much?
But why is that bad?

273
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,698
- You see what I'm saying?
- Tell me, why?

274
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,138
You'll hesitate. Okay?
You'll blow a frame.

275
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,905
I can't risk that.
That'll be three for me. Three.

276
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,276
Look, I need the money.

277
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,476
- I can't make what I need on my own.
- Yeah, well, too bad.

278
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,553
It's not about memorization.

279
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,849
This is a choice, okay?
You're not ready.

280
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:26,393
You think it's something to do for now.
It's not some summer job, okay?

281
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,293
You can get the Wilshire bus down here.

282
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,727
Can you get that purse
in less than two minutes?

283
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:37,633
- What purse?
- That one.

284
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:44,076
- She has to voluntarily hand me her purse?
- In two minutes.

285
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,445
- No.
- I can.

286
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,480
- No, you can't.
- I bet you the ring.

287
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,144
Right?

288
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,303
- Please.
- Thank you.

289
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,942
- Which floor?
- Four. Thank you.

290
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,985
- Sir?
- Ten, please.

291
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:37,156
- Oh, God. Oh, brother.
- Goddamn it.

292
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,429
- Is it an earthquake?
- No. Don't worry. Don't worry.

293
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:44,129
- Everything is okay.
- I can't stay calm. I'm claustrophobic.

294
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,968
- I'm really not good at this.
- This is not good.

295
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,372
- Please, please do something.
- Just relax.

296
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,807
Let's call somebody.

297
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:53,743
I'm doing it, but it will take
more than 20 minutes.

298
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,043
- I'm sure.
- I'm really not good at this.

299
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,277
What are you doing?
Don't open the door.

300
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,422
- It's easy.
- Calm down and wait for the authorities.

301
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,922
- No, that takes...
- You push the call?

302
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,855
- I did.
- You're being impatient.

303
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:09,623
No, listen, this is how people get hurt.
Don't open the door.

304
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:12,426
- Wait, did you push the call?
- Yes, he did.

305
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,831
This won't take more
than two minutes.

306
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:18,166
- I'm not going out there.
- This was easy. Okay.

307
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,831
Let's just stay here.
Let's you and I stay here.

308
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,944
- I'm not gonna wait.
- You can use the stairs. I'll help.

309
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,081
- What do you mean? That way?
- I'll hold your purse.

310
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,716
I'll hold your purse.

311
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:34,913
Okay. There you go.

312
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,354
- What do I do?
- It is an easy jump. Come on.

313
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:40,256
- All right, all right.
- Can you help her, sir?

314
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,159
Yeah. Yeah, here. Let me...

315
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,165
Come on. Come on.
It's gonna be easy.

316
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,767
That stuff in the elevator,
you made that up?

317
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:52,536
That was good.

318
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:56,739
You have one thing money
and practice can't buy.

319
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:59,039
You look like a nice guy.

320
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,540
What?

321
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,213
You look like a nice guy. It's good.

322
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,714
Hey, you guys, seriously.
When I am on the...

323
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,646
Quiet! When I am on the phone,
I am on the phone.

324
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,048
Okay? That means you don't talk.

325
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:42,746
Oh, my God.

326
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,517
Holy shit.

327
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,696
- Didn't you see me?
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

328
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:52,800
- I was standing right here.
- God, I didn't even see you.

329
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:55,027
- There are people around.
- Are you okay?

330
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:59,070
- You could buy gas.
- Of course I could buy gas.

331
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,368
I could also not buy it.

332
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,807
Nobody would buy it
if they didn't have to.

333
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,312
You wouldn't have got that woman
out of the elevator, would you?

334
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,076
- You would've just grabbed it and left her.
- What?

335
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:14,018
I said I could get her purse.
I never said I would steal it.

336
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,850
I never said you said that.

337
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:21,186
What?

338
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,623
Here.

339
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:28,599
It's in there.

340
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,800
So here's my office. Hey.

341
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,373
Teddy called.

342
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,914
- When?
- This morning.

343
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,611
- What'd you say?
- That you were in the hospital.

344
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,384
- You want a Coke?
- Yeah. Sounds good.

345
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,389
Two Cokes.

346
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:57,359
- Someone is looking for you?
- Yeah. Some cop.

347
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,727
A cop? Really?
A cop is looking for you?

348
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,359
Relax, will you?
You see a SWAT team outside?

349
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,576
Ron's.

350
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:17,846
Hang on.

351
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,623
Valerie.

352
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,657
Fuck.

353
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,794
Yeah?

354
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,758
Why?

355
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,500
Well, I can't.

356
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:40,198
Because I can't. Because
I'm in the middle of something.

357
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,639
It'll take me an hour
to get down there.

358
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:47,042
No. It's all the way fucking
downtown, Valerie. Forget it.

359
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,778
That's your problem. Hey...

360
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,888
I don't know what you're talking about,
okay? I don't know who that is.

361
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,196
All right, you want me to come?
I'll come. But I'm warning you.

362
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:05,822
If this is some fucking ruse
to get me to talk about...

363
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,230
All right.

364
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,165
Fine. Fine.

365
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,200
All right. Bye.

366
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:19,202
Come on.

367
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,339
We're leaving?

368
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:24,007
- Who was that?
- My sister.

369
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,677
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

370
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:30,416
Some guy I know collapsed in the lobby
of the hotel where she works.

371
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:34,585
Had a heart attack or something.
Hey, hey. No drinks in the car.

372
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:38,290
Seriously. Drink it or whatever.

373
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,335
You got any brothers or sisters?

374
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,338
An older brother.

375
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,672
- Where's he?
- In Arizona.

376
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,974
- What's he do?
- He's gay.

377
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,507
That's his occupation?
What's he do?

378
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,245
Sells furniture or something.

379
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,921
- You don't talk to him?
- Not that much.

380
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:04,649
How come?

381
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:09,953
He had a different father than me, okay?

382
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:12,127
Whoops.

383
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,097
"Whoops" what?

384
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,100
"Whoops" whoops.

385
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:18,171
What about you?

386
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,399
It's just you and your sister?

387
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,537
- Why do you wanna know?
- I just told you.

388
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,547
One sister, one brother.
Both younger.

389
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:30,012
What are they like?

390
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,220
My brother's great.

391
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,855
Michael.

392
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,155
Great kid, really bright.

393
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,986
What's your sister like?

394
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,230
What's my sister like?

395
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,597
My sister likes giving me shit.

396
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:09,452
- Your sister works here?
- Yeah.

397
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,779
Okay. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

398
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,517
Who's this?

399
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:46,889
- Brian.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

400
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:53,198
- I called you.
- He's working with me. What do you want?

401
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:58,272
Do you wanna show me
what you have to show me, Valerie?

402
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,035
Or do you wanna make a scene
in the lobby of your four-star hotel?

403
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:15,522
<i>Richard, this is where I work.</i>

404
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:20,116
I don't want you or your associates
doing business here.

405
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:23,594
- I heard you.
- Then why are your partners collapsing here?

406
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:25,528
- Who was it?
- An old Spanish guy.

407
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,998
That narrows it down.
Did he give his name?

408
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,933
Choa? Ochoa?

409
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,334
Ochoa's dead.

410
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,408
Well, Ochoa was creating
a disturbance in the lobby...

411
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:39,604
...trying to see a guest.
A VIP, a VVIP.

412
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:44,343
- So I had him escorted out.
- Yeah, see? My sister the snitch.

413
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,421
While this friend of yours
was being escorted out of my hotel...

414
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,048
...he fainted or something.
He had a seizure.

415
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:53,819
I don't need this, Richard.

416
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:56,691
The house doctor's probably gonna
call an ambulance.

417
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,390
- What's this have to do with me?
- He was screaming your name.

418
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,865
He recognized me.
He begged me to call you.

419
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,527
So I called you.

420
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,072
- Yeah? And I'm supposed to...?
- Go in there, calm him down.

421
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:11,872
Make sure that he doesn't come back,
and don't you come back either.

422
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,446
- You called me.
- I know.

423
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,982
Do what you need to do,
Richard, and go.

424
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:24,251
Let me get this straight. You came
to the hotel asking for Hannigan.

425
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:27,224
And when you couldn't get through,
you got nervous.

426
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,761
And then you collapsed. Right?

427
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:33,162
So now you need someone
to help you sell the goods today.

428
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,893
- Right?
- Yeah.

429
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,870
- So, what made you think of me?
- Because I saw your sister.

430
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:48,070
The Monroe Silver Certificate.

431
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,116
I copied it.

432
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:56,223
It took me an entire year.
I almost ruined my eyes.

433
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:59,258
- You copied it from what?
- From a set of photographs...

434
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,759
...taken by the Treasury Department.

435
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,956
I have a partner in the inside.
He's my son-in-law.

436
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:08,432
He's the one who taught me
about the bill in the first place.

437
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,300
He read a story about Hannigan's
collection of antique currency.

438
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,305
He went and pulled the file on it.

439
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:18,378
See, he's a janitor,
but he's smart. He came to me.

440
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:22,141
Yeah? So Ochoa the forger has a relative
in the Treasury Department?

441
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,545
Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,852
- Sounds like a sting.
- No. He's married to my daughter.

443
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,818
How come you never told me before?

444
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,982
He's black, I didn't wanna
get into it with you.

445
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,854
- Look, he's gonna send it to a lab.
- No.

446
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,363
A lab test will take a week at least.

447
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:42,560
He won't have time for that.
He'll be gone tomorrow.

448
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:44,602
How do you know?

449
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:46,400
How do I know?

450
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:52,679
Look at this. He says he's negotiating
to buy a group of TV stations...

451
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,475
...but the seller is stalling
the negotiations.

452
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,915
This says that Hannigan operates
as a resident of Monaco.

453
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:02,488
If he doesn't leave tomorrow,
he'll be over the number of days...

454
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:07,185
...he can spend in the U.S. Without paying
tax on all his business all over the world.

455
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:10,126
And that could be
tens of millions of dollars.

456
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,061
Okay, how much you gonna ask?

457
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:15,964
Well, I don't know.
Double whatever he offers.

458
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:20,096
But, Richard...
Richard, it's got to be done today.

459
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,436
- Yeah.
- It's now or it's never.

460
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,134
- Let go. Let go of me.
- Okay?

461
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,507
Don't cough on me!

462
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:33,846
Okay. I'm gonna give you 20 percent.

463
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,650
Look. You're confused. Okay?

464
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:40,386
If I leave now, all you get is a tube
up your ass at the hospital.

465
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:45,124
- Look, I can call somebody else.
- Yeah, go ahead. Here, use my phone.

466
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,427
- How much you want?
- Ninety percent.

467
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:54,140
- But that's crazy.
- No, it really isn't.

468
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,608
Look, okay, 50-50.

469
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,576
Ninety percent.

470
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:05,175
I should have called somebody else.

471
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:12,349
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,926
So I gotta go meet the son-in-law
and go to Ochoa's.

473
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:21,762
- So you're doing it.
- Of course. If I sell it, I get 90 percent.

474
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:25,872
- But this is fucking federal shit, man.
- Yeah, and it's a six-figure score.

475
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,008
Okay. Listen. Hold on a minute.

476
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:29,768
What? What?

477
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,206
- I want in.
- In where?

478
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,779
The deal. I need the cash, man.
I want a part.

479
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:36,678
- A part? What?
- We're together for the day, right?

480
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,319
- Just a small percentage.
- Because I'm nice?

481
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:42,615
This guy got me through my sister.
Who do you think you are?

482
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,485
The day just took a turn. Okay?

483
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,251
Come on, I was there.

484
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,129
- Your name is?
- My name is Valerie.

485
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,274
Valerie.

486
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:08,382
- What are you doing?
- I need to get my parking validated.

487
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,451
Is that Hannigan?
That guy you were talking to?

488
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,950
Leave him alone, Richard.

489
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,148
Don't tell him you have a boyfriend.
It'll cut your tips in half.

490
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:25,062
Do you remember a song,
an old R & B song from the '70s?

491
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:26,829
It goes something like:

492
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:36,043
- Don't remember?
- That's it, let's go.

493
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,577
- I won't bother you again.
- Nothing else you wanna say to me?

494
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,776
- Oh, yeah. Talk to your lawyers.
- Your lawyers are holding things up.

495
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:46,318
- That's what they do.
- What about Michael?

496
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,853
- This isn't about him.
- It's all about him.

497
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:51,150
You sued me,
and now it's gonna play out.

498
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,759
- What do you want?
- Richard.

499
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,054
- I want your lawyer to...
- Hey, Mike.

500
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:56,992
- How are you?
- Good.

501
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,396
- I'm okay. I'm working here.
- She's got you all dressed up.

502
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:04,561
It's not a bad job. I'm just getting
the swing of it, but tips are great.

503
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,173
- That's what I hear.
- I gotta get back to work.

504
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,775
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

505
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:10,638
- Be good.
- Yeah, good to see you.

506
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,872
He's a great kid.
Hope you're not fucking him up.

507
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,415
Would you please leave now?

508
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:20,281
Ciao.

509
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:27,391
The Treasury removed silver and gold
certificates from circulation in 1934.

510
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:30,622
They asked people to redeem them
in exchange for cash.

511
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,199
Most people did, but collectors didn't.

512
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,773
Treasury kept a list of all the bills
that was printed and all that was redeemed.

513
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:45,540
And all but three of the bills
countersigned by White are accounted for.

514
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,942
There's never been a recorded
public sale of this bill.

515
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,382
So most people, including Treasury...

516
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:56,182
...think somehow the outstanding bills
were either lost or destroyed.

517
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:59,656
So if one of these
would happen to turn up...

518
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,387
...it'd be the most valuable
piece of currency...

519
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,895
...in the history of the United States.

520
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,428
- How my father-in-law?
- Old.

521
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,204
Got that right.

522
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:14,136
I gotta go.

523
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,833
So talk to Ochoa, all right?

524
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,979
All right, baby.

525
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:37,123
- You wait here.
- No, I'm not waiting in the car this time.

526
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,459
Fine.

527
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,467
Come on. Watch and learn.

528
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:03,256
Mrs. Ochoa.

529
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,424
- Who are you?
- Your husband's friend.

530
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,460
He sent us to pick up an envelope
that he left for us.

531
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,529
It's a large, yellow envelope.

532
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:13,997
- On the shelf under the Chinese jar.
- My husband isn't here.

533
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:17,433
He said even if he wasn't here
we could pick up the envelope.

534
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:20,802
- Look for it, please.
- My husband is not in. Come back later.

535
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,411
Ma'am, I heard you. We can't come back.
This is very important.

536
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:29,016
Mr. Ochoa, Roberto, told me to come
over here and pick up this envelope.

537
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:31,708
Roberto, my husband, isn't home.

538
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:35,049
So if he's not home, why do you want
to get into the house?

539
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:38,090
Stop meddling in your husband's business.
Listen to me.

540
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:41,422
- No, I can call the police.
- I don't wanna get in the house.

541
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:44,895
- I just came to pick up something.
- I think you should go away.

542
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,797
No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

543
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,071
Excuse me, we're going now.

544
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:54,605
My brother always gets worked up when
we're going to visit our mother.

545
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:56,003
You're brothers?

546
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,101
We're half brothers.

547
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:01,748
He promised our mother
we would bring the photos...

548
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,713
and that's why he's acting like this.

549
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:07,217
But we're only asking you a favor.

550
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:11,289
Tell your husband that
Richard and Brian were here, please.

551
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,722
We'll come back
for the photos tomorrow.

552
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,123
Oh well. Thank you very much.

553
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,926
No, wait. Come here.

554
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,862
- Okay.
- No, no. Not you.

555
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,027
You stay over there.

556
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:29,770
There are photos for your mother
in that envelope?

557
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,946
They were beautiful copies
that your husband made...

558
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,638
that our mother loved very much.

559
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,219
The originals got damaged
so your husband copied them.

560
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,217
That's why it's so urgent.

561
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:43,981
Where does your mother live?

562
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:46,126
My mother lives in
San Juan Capistrano.

563
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,989
Do you know San Juan Capistrano?

564
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,134
Oh, my son's wife is from
San Juan Capistrano.

565
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:57,600
Unbelievable! Wow, what a coincidence.

566
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:00,399
I love San Juan. It's one of the
most beautiful places there is.

567
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:03,168
- Yes, very beautiful.
- Isn't it true?

568
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,978
Give me just one second.

569
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,507
What?

570
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,581
Fifteen percent.

571
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,551
- Thirty.
- Fuck off.

572
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:20,421
- You can't do this without me.
- I'll kill you first.

573
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,119
Let's go.

574
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,422
Twenty.

575
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:27,259
Minus expenses.

576
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:33,205
What a coincidence, I love
San Juan Capistrano.

577
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:36,376
My mother is always telling us never
to move her from San Juan Capistrano.

578
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:37,874
Because she's always saying...

579
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,843
"Where a Gianolo is born
they should also die."

580
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:42,845
It's a phrase she's always repeating.

581
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,782
- She is family of Father Gianolo?
- She is his cousin.

582
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:53,392
Since we were children,
we knew Father Gianolo.

583
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:56,119
And if Father Gianolo
were to come visit us...

584
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,060
the problem is that
Richard doesn't speak Spanish.

585
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,700
He only speaks English.
We don't know who his father is.

586
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:06,695
That's why he's always
fighting with mother.

587
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,778
Yeah.

588
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:18,174
Hey, hold on a second.
Don't get fucking taco sauce all over it.

589
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,684
Yeah. What do you got?

590
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:26,484
What time?

591
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:29,521
All right. Thanks.

592
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:32,832
So Hannigan's at the hotel
the rest of the afternoon.

593
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,436
- They're having drinks at 3:00.
- How will you get to him?

594
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,772
Hey. Hey.

595
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,774
Let's just relax. He'll come.

596
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:44,728
Hello?

597
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,270
Hey.

598
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,907
Yeah.

599
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,772
Yeah. I'm at the hotel.

600
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,406
As soon as I can.

601
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,981
Well, I haven't met with him yet.

602
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:00,677
What?

603
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,618
Because I know.

604
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,758
Because I know.

605
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,894
Because he's a collector, that's why.

606
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,057
Rebecca.

607
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:12,563
Because he's leaving the country,
that's why.

608
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,395
It's some bullshit world-tax thing.

609
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:18,737
All right. Love you.

610
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:20,972
Jesus.

611
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,474
Oh, your phone's working now?

612
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:25,675
You fuck!

613
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,209
What are you doing
in such a nice hotel?

614
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:33,853
I'm making a sale. Straight up.

615
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:37,183
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

616
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:39,724
You're making a deal
in the bathroom, huh?

617
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,384
Richard? Hey...

618
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:42,927
- Police.
- Wait, wait.

619
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,962
Who the fuck are you?
You with him?

620
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:46,765
- Is he with you?
- Yeah.

621
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,162
Get in here.

622
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,394
- Come on!
- Coming.

623
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:53,039
Now, what the hell are you two up to?

624
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:57,377
This is a police matter. Step outside.

625
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,773
Excuse me, officer. These gentlemen
are here because I called them.

626
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,545
- And who are you?
- My name's William Hannigan.

627
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,211
I'm a guest here at the hotel.

628
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,324
- You called them?
- That's right.

629
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,221
Why don't you put the gun down...

630
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:18,627
...and then we can possibly negotiate
another means of resolving the situation.

631
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,630
Well, I'm sure there is.

632
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,393
I'll let you know.

633
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,470
You come with me.

634
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:27,536
You two, stay put.

635
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:34,611
- What are you trying to do to me?
- You said, make it look real.

636
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:36,647
Look real.

637
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,378
Okay, we gotta go back in.
Just take whatever he gives you.

638
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:43,079
- What about my part?
- I'll get it to you.

639
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:46,021
Yeah, you'll get it to me right now.

640
00:40:50,464 --> 00:40:52,659
By the way, Teddy's looking for you.

641
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:57,327
- I'll see him, soon as this is done.
- He's getting tired of leaving messages.

642
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,009
My pleasure.

643
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:51,315
Follow me.

644
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:55,425
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

645
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,828
- Where'd your friend get that gun?
- Same place he got his badge. At his job.

646
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,911
You told the cop downstairs
you got something to show me.

647
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,138
Who are you?

648
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,975
I mean, I heard the name,
but who are you?

649
00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:19,945
I'm the person
you were tipped off about.

650
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,352
Look, you did us a favor downstairs,
which we appreciate, but the truth is...

651
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,993
...I have no idea
what you're talking about.

652
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:30,790
- You got something to say?
- No. No. He speaks for me.

653
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,298
- What?
- He speaks for me.

654
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:39,539
I'm just about to complete
a $ 7-billion TV deal.

655
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:43,199
Now, if you've got something to show me,
then show me.

656
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:46,403
If not, there's the door. Fuck off.

657
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,059
You got time for us now?

658
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:05,360
- You got this?
- Yeah.

659
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:07,261
- I want it.
- How much?

660
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:11,734
Come back in two hours with the actual bill,
and then we'll discuss the money.

661
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:13,338
You wanna do this today?

662
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,670
Well, as you may have heard,
I have to leave the country.

663
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,074
No, I hadn't heard that.

664
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:25,245
- Guess that makes us lucky.
- I'll settle for smart.

665
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:42,765
- What are you doing here?
- Don't worry.

666
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:45,336
- Stay out of this.
- We were having a meeting.

667
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:48,566
- A meeting? You're business partners?
- Don't listen to her.

668
00:43:48,742 --> 00:43:52,007
He tell you what happened to his
last partner? Make sure he pays you.

669
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:55,905
- Richard? Richard. Don't come back.
- Yeah, oh, we'll be back.

670
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:58,176
- I will call the police.
- And say what?

671
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:00,843
Richard, go.

672
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:05,885
So just talk to my wife about the bill.
She'll know what to do. Okay?

673
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:27,178
Hey, listen. I need a favor, man.

674
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:29,646
Can you take me somewhere?

675
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,314
Come on.

676
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:48,960
- How are your legs?
- The same.

677
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:52,328
Tomorrow I will bring you your money.

678
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:56,170
It should be big.
Then we can buy you the piano.

679
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:57,944
One that has a nice sound.

680
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,841
With these hands of mine,
how can I play?

681
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:05,883
Even less if you keep drinking.

682
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:12,052
Are you working?

683
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:16,128
Be careful.

684
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,890
It's okay. What could happen to me?

685
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:22,292
Just be careful.

686
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:25,972
Okay, I'm going.

687
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,949
- Your old man sick or something?
- Diabetic.

688
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,055
- Insulin, the whole deal?
- Yeah.

689
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,059
I'm not big on sick people.

690
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:50,458
- He's diabetic. What...?
- I know. I'm just saying, they freak me out.

691
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:57,262
What did your sister mean?

692
00:45:57,438 --> 00:46:01,238
- About what?
- You know, about your partners.

693
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:06,107
What does she know?
She's not even in the game, uptight bitch.

694
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,078
And what is this lawsuit thing?

695
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,652
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't know?

696
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,119
This thing with her and your brother.
I was there, I heard it.

697
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,317
My mother died without a will, and
my sister thinks I shouldn't get anything.

698
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:25,625
So she hired a lawyer, so then I hired
a lawyer, and my lawyer's better. Okay?

699
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,904
- Why did you stop working with Ochoa?
- None of your business.

700
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:39,443
Today I'm your partner,
so it is my business.

701
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:42,411
You could say I unilaterally
readjusted the dividends.

702
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:46,417
- So you fucked your partner?
- "You fucked your partner." Were you there?

703
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:50,455
Listen, Ochoa's an idiot, okay?
He's talented, but he's an idiot.

704
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:53,092
If it was so bad,
why would he call me again?

705
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,195
Listen, I'm not gonna fuck you
on this thing.

706
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:57,591
- Oh, really?
- Okay?

707
00:46:57,764 --> 00:46:59,391
And how do I know that?

708
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,659
Because it would be wrong.

709
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,996
Focus.

710
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:05,865
Okay?

711
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:19,745
No, because I'm not happy
about my offer being shopped.

712
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,087
Because they've seen our books.
Give them one hour.

713
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,886
I don't care if we lose it.
I'm not prepared to go any higher.

714
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,929
And you can tell them that from me. Yeah,
well, I want you to tell them in person.

715
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,727
But I want you to do it now.

716
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,100
Show me.

717
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:00,451
- Check it.
- Mr. Hannigan.

718
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:04,788
Without a full battery of lab tests,
including a spectrographic analysis...

719
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,559
I don't have time for this.
You're the expert.

720
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:10,635
Check it over and tell me if it's genuine.

721
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:37,953
Smile when I...

722
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,793
The portrait is lifelike
and stands out distinctly.

723
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:15,492
The hairlines and the points on the seals
are sharp and even...

724
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:17,933
...with very well-defined outlines.

725
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:22,838
The background density is accurate
and very well-blended.

726
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:30,648
My opinion, subject to further testing,
is this article is genuine.

727
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:35,148
Good.

728
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:38,917
Good, good. Okay. Pay the man.

729
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:43,186
Thank you.

730
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,373
So how much?

731
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:59,876
I don't know what you guys do
for a living, and I don't care...

732
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:03,710
...but one thing is certain,
you know fuck-all about currency.

733
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:09,049
This thing dropped down on you, so
whatever you get tonight is found money.

734
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:10,888
Am I wrong?

735
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:13,719
No, you're not wrong.

736
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,885
We don't know anything about currency.

737
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:19,055
But we know this is the most valuable
piece of paper ever printed...

738
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:21,223
...by the U.S. Treasury Department.

739
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,701
You know, that is, according to our partner
at the U.S. Treasury Department.

740
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:34,039
I'll give you 400,000 for it.

741
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:37,774
What?

742
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,179
What?

743
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:40,944
What are you doing?

744
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,453
Brian. Brian, sit down.

745
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:49,727
No. What are you talking about?
Sit down.

746
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:52,763
Brian, you're making everybody nervous.
Sit down.

747
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,934
- Brian.
- What is he saying?

748
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:03,572
He wants 750.

749
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:15,820
Fine.

750
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,822
Come back at 9:00,
and I'll give you the money.

751
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,864
- We got $ 750,000.
- Not yet, we don't.

752
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,263
- Twenty percent.
- Minus expenses.

753
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:32,166
Bullshit. This is not real.
You're gonna fuck me.

754
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,806
This is not real?

755
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:35,566
- Give me that.
- No.

756
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:40,304
Come here, come here. Give me this.
Listen, you shouldn't come tonight.

757
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,940
- I'll do it. You're gonna screw it up.
- I'm not letting you go by yourself.

758
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,346
Do you think I trust you?

759
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:24,118
How did it go?

760
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:26,386
What?

761
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,655
Did he buy it?

762
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,258
- What is it with this guy?
- I don't know.

763
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:35,924
- What are you talking about?
- My cut.

764
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,866
What do you think you're doing?
Are you a fucking clown or something?

765
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:46,342
Either I get my cut or I tell him it's a fake.
You and I both know it's a fake.

766
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,618
- How much?
- Well, 15 percent.

767
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:55,277
- Fuck you.
- I'll go and tell him it's a fake.

768
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:57,548
- Then you get nothing.
- Ten percent.

769
00:52:57,724 --> 00:52:59,021
- Two.
- Seven and a half.

770
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:02,525
- Five. All right?
- Yes.

771
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:07,664
Give me a phone number
where I can get in touch with you.

772
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,267
How do I know you'll call?

773
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,631
You want a receipt?
This is how it's done.

774
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:16,432
- I'm not a thief.
- Yeah, of course not. Sorry.

775
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:19,167
Here's my card.

776
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,644
I'm at this number in the mornings.

777
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:24,511
- What time?
- Eight to 11, except Wednesdays.

778
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,811
Fine. Goodbye.

779
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:31,218
Un-fucking-believable.

780
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,359
- Everybody.
- How much?

781
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:36,188
- Five.
- Five?

782
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,264
You're handing out too many shares.

783
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,963
Where are we going?

784
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:46,230
- Back to my office.
- No, I don't wanna go back there.

785
00:53:46,406 --> 00:53:47,737
What's wrong with it?

786
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:51,105
I don't know. By the time we get there
we'll have to be back.

787
00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:53,439
- I'll meet you here.
- Where are you going?

788
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:56,548
- I don't know. I feel like walking.
- Yeah, all right.

789
00:53:58,285 --> 00:53:59,946
You ever been to prison?

790
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,554
Yeah. Juvie.

791
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:08,352
First time they got me, I was part of a crew
working a merchandise thing. Electronics.

792
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:10,187
You rent out a space...

793
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:13,821
...spend a couple months building
relationships with suppliers.

794
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,458
You give them enough real money
to get your credit limit raised...

795
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:20,765
...and your net extended
to 90 days, right?

796
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:24,407
Once you got a couple companies,
you place these huge orders...

797
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:28,172
...max out your credit, and when the stuff
shows up, sell it for cash and split.

798
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,145
It's a pretty good one too.

799
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:32,217
The suppliers never see your face...

800
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:35,548
...and it's three months
before they realize what happened.

801
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:40,419
But this guy we had driving
the stuff for us, Lance...

802
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:43,020
...gets pulled over for driving stoned.

803
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,563
The cops check the back of the truck,
so he gives everybody up.

804
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:50,396
- Motherfucker.
- The second time was an insurance thing.

805
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,561
I learned my lesson there.

806
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:55,401
Insurance companies don't mess around.

807
00:54:55,575 --> 00:55:00,205
The good hands at Allstate will choke you
till your fucking eyes pop out.

808
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,546
But, you know, I didn't
get messed with too much inside.

809
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,779
Got real sick once, had an operation.

810
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:11,449
Prison hospital.

811
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:14,149
Never been so scared in my whole life.

812
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:16,519
I mean, think about it.

813
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:21,929
You're a doctor, you go to medical school
so you can end up in a prison hospital?

814
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:25,397
- You have a girl?
- No.

815
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,132
I can't be without a woman.

816
00:55:30,043 --> 00:55:32,204
Motherfucker!

817
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:43,617
Stop him!

818
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:47,451
Stop him! Stop that guy!

819
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:52,230
Get out of the way!

820
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,403
Get out of the way!

821
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:27,566
Go, go!

822
00:56:30,837 --> 00:56:32,805
Check the briefcase!

823
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,701
Is it there?

824
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:38,644
No!

825
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:40,641
Fuck!

826
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:47,713
Fuck!

827
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:52,821
The idea was to wait a few years
and then let this one surface.

828
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,358
I mean, I don't know, maybe in Europe.

829
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:56,823
How much?

830
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,568
Aren't you getting a little ahead
of yourself, Richard?

831
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:07,695
- What do you mean?
- You owe me for the other one.

832
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:12,272
What's his offer?

833
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,772
- Six...
- Seven-fifty.

834
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:21,753
Seven-fifty?

835
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:28,089
All right, I'll give you 20 percent.

836
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:31,526
Ten for this one
and 10 for the other one.

837
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:34,259
Well, that's...

838
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:36,825
That's fair.

839
00:57:37,637 --> 00:57:41,937
- So make it 30 for the stress.
- Go fuck yourself.

840
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:43,973
In cash.

841
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:45,543
Upfront.

842
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,509
Come back when you have it.

843
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,705
I don't have that much upfront.

844
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,278
You don't have a choice, Richard.

845
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,353
This morning...

846
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,653
...I didn't have a choice.

847
00:57:59,926 --> 00:58:01,894
- We're fucked, man.
- No.

848
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,029
Fucked is handcuffed on the pavement.

849
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:08,497
We're three hours from three-quarters
of a million dollars. We're far from fucked.

850
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:10,829
- But we have no money.
- I have some money.

851
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:14,167
- Oh, really? You have 225 grand?
- No, less.

852
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,900
I was gonna sit on it till after the lawsuit.

853
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,910
Oh, your sister, right? The estate thing.
Another person fucked over.

854
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,140
- She didn't see the angle.
- Otherwise she would've done it?

855
00:58:24,317 --> 00:58:25,579
Yeah, absolutely.

856
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,118
You don't know her.
She's fucking unhinged.

857
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:31,314
You're following her down a hallway,
staring at her ass...

858
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:35,427
...instead of watching her, listening
to her voice, boom, you're done.

859
00:58:37,397 --> 00:58:39,331
And where's that money?

860
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,393
Thing is, we're still short.

861
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:46,665
I could get something from my lawyer,
plus, you know, my secret stash...

862
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:49,774
...plus your 38,
that's still only 207 grand.

863
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,911
- What?
- Two hundred and seven.

864
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:57,015
- No, I'm not giving you that money, man.
- What? You'll have 150 grand.

865
00:58:57,183 --> 00:59:01,244
No way. I'm not giving you
my dad's money. I can't!

866
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:03,252
- Wait.
- Get out.

867
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:04,890
- Get the fuck out.
- Why?

868
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:07,390
I'll get the rest myself. The day's over.

869
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,187
Go find another partner.

870
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:11,796
I'm not kidding.
Get the fuck out of my car!

871
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,227
Take it easy, man.

872
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:17,836
You think I planned this whole thing
so I could take your lousy 38 grand?!

873
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:21,838
If you're so worried, why didn't you
catch the kid with the briefcase?!

874
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:24,704
Christ, have you learned anything today?!

875
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:26,868
- Okay, calm down!
- Jesus!

876
00:59:27,046 --> 00:59:29,071
It's the money for my dad, okay?

877
00:59:29,249 --> 00:59:32,309
What if something goes wrong?
You said they might kill him!

878
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:36,080
Whoa, what "if"? There's no "if".
This is happening. We're doing it.

879
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:37,655
We're doing this! Fuck!

880
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,657
You're trying to save your daddy?
I'm trying to save my own ass!

881
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,820
Who do you think is calling me all day?
I got everything I have on the line.

882
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,590
Everything!

883
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:52,831
Look, this is happening, okay?
We're doing this. You gotta believe it.

884
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:58,308
Now, we're gonna make the sale,
and we're gonna get the cash. That's all.

885
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:28,368
Carlos.

886
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:35,136
- Hey, man. This is Carlos.
- Hello.

887
01:00:35,315 --> 01:00:36,942
There's the car.

888
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:39,282
Give me the keys.

889
01:00:39,452 --> 01:00:40,749
The keys?

890
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,353
Thanks.

891
01:01:03,176 --> 01:01:06,805
I like a Lexus better.
It's worth more.

892
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:08,378
What did he say?

893
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:12,279
Something about a Lexus?
This is a $60,000 car.

894
01:01:12,952 --> 01:01:14,647
Tomorrow you can sell it
for a higher price.

895
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:17,819
And why don't you sell it?

896
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:19,821
I need the money today.

897
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,093
Do me a favor.

898
01:01:38,878 --> 01:01:40,971
What, you don't trust me?

899
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:52,718
<i>Concierge. This is Valerie speaking.</i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

900
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:01,528
No, Richard.
It's too late for that.

901
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:08,430
By the lounge.

902
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:12,203
I'll give you five minutes,
and then I'm calling security.

903
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:18,984
I'm sorry it got as far as it did.

904
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:23,418
I think the best thing
for all of us to do is to drop it.

905
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:30,656
I don't like Michael seeing me this way,
and I think it's for the best.

906
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:40,162
Just accept it, Valerie.

907
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,484
How'd it go?

908
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:53,880
What?

909
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:55,987
- You dropped the lawsuit?
- Yeah.

910
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:59,283
That ought to keep her
off my back for a while.

911
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,493
So have you got something
going on with the concierge?

912
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:06,355
She's my sister.

913
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,167
Really?

914
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,266
Does she know I'm about to make you
a very rich man?

915
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:16,942
Well, she knows we're working on a deal.

916
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:21,876
Now, with regards to the deal, I really think
you should put in something a little extra.

917
01:03:22,448 --> 01:03:24,279
Like a signing bonus.

918
01:03:26,853 --> 01:03:29,287
- What are you talking about?
- Valerie.

919
01:03:29,455 --> 01:03:32,322
I want to fuck her.
I've wanted her since I got here...

920
01:03:32,492 --> 01:03:36,394
...but I couldn't have her,
but now I can. Because of you.

921
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:38,029
You're kidding me, right?

922
01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:42,759
You get Valerie to bring the Monroe,
and you and I still have a deal.

923
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,934
But it has to be her.

924
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:48,770
Because I'll accept no one else.

925
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:58,913
What happened?

926
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:08,025
She won't do it.

927
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:19,930
I'm dropping the lawsuit.
What more do you want?

928
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,771
Just do this, okay, Val?

929
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:26,976
This is huge for me. This is the biggest
thing I've ever gotten close to.

930
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:31,515
Please. All you gotta do is bring him
the briefcase and, you know...

931
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:34,653
Whatever happens after that
is up to you.

932
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:45,987
I'm trying to do something here.
I'm trying to meet you halfway.

933
01:04:46,165 --> 01:04:48,827
But if you want me to drag you
through court for 10 years...

934
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:51,196
...and for Michael to be a bellhop
for the rest of his life...

935
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,964
...well, then, just say no.
Just walk away.

936
01:04:59,445 --> 01:05:02,608
Meet me in the ballroom in five minutes.

937
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,426
- Richard!
- Hey.

938
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:16,960
Michael...

939
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:20,326
...I think Richard has something
that he needs to say to you.

940
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,898
- What's he doing here?
- I want you to tell him the truth.

941
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:29,803
I think he has a right to know.

942
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,441
To know what?

943
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,706
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm good.

944
01:05:37,883 --> 01:05:39,180
- Good.
- Richard.

945
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:41,976
Tell him about the lawsuit.

946
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:49,525
- What are you talking about, Valerie?
- I'm talking about the truth, Richard.

947
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:53,825
- I'm talking about the fucking truth.
- He knows the truth, okay?

948
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,662
- My lawyer screwed some things up...
- Richard...

949
01:05:56,836 --> 01:06:00,363
...if you want me
to fuck William Hannigan...

950
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,565
...I want you to tell him the truth.

951
01:06:03,743 --> 01:06:07,679
- What's going on?
- Richard, tell him the truth...

952
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:10,075
...and I will go with Hannigan.

953
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,908
Tell him.

954
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:14,950
That's my price.

955
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:32,964
Mike...

956
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:39,303
...I had my lawyer block the estate
and submit me as the only heir...

957
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:41,673
...so I'd get all the money.

958
01:06:43,149 --> 01:06:45,344
I bribed the judge.

959
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,719
And...

960
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:57,226
...the lawyers and...

961
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,356
...the taxes?

962
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,434
Why?

963
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,596
It's a lot of money, Mike.

964
01:07:17,683 --> 01:07:19,275
And this thing about Hannigan?

965
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,976
Mike...

966
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:25,214
...she's a big girl. She knows
what she's doing. Just stay out of it.

967
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:38,870
What the fuck are you trying to do? Huh?

968
01:07:39,038 --> 01:07:41,563
Are you happy now?
Is that what you wanted?

969
01:07:45,945 --> 01:07:47,606
- Fuck you.
- No, Mike, Mike...

970
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,941
- Michael! Michael!
- Hey, Mike!

971
01:07:50,116 --> 01:07:52,243
- Hey, easy, man.
- Michael!

972
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:20,936
Make sure the money's all there.

973
01:08:21,781 --> 01:08:23,271
Count it.

974
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:38,557
All right.

975
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:41,598
So just don't let the briefcase
out of your sight.

976
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:44,368
I want 15.

977
01:08:45,004 --> 01:08:48,201
- What?
- I want 15.

978
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:50,402
Thousand?

979
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,238
No.

980
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:56,973
Listen. The price was my confessing
to Michael. That was the price.

981
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:58,673
Now it's that...

982
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:00,751
...plus 15 percent.

983
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:08,554
Val, I can't.

984
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:12,288
That would put me at 70 percent out,
I'd barely be making any money.

985
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:15,160
Make up your mind.
Fifteen percent...

986
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:17,268
...or I walk.

987
01:09:19,605 --> 01:09:21,698
All right, split with me,
7.5 percent.

988
01:09:21,874 --> 01:09:23,102
- What?
- Come on.

989
01:09:23,275 --> 01:09:25,937
I put up my savings, my car,
you go halves with me.

990
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:27,942
- I'm sorry, it's your sister.
- No.

991
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:30,513
I pulled you out of that casino.
I let you in.

992
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:35,052
I let you in. You would have been busted
at the fucking casino if it wasn't for me.

993
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,582
He's doing it.

994
01:09:40,025 --> 01:09:41,925
It's okay.

995
01:09:54,139 --> 01:09:56,607
Listen, don't fall for my sister.

996
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,141
I told you, you don't know her.

997
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:02,109
We're lucky it was only 15 percent.

998
01:10:09,889 --> 01:10:13,518
Hey. You got any credit cards that work?

999
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:07,134
What are you doing?

1000
01:11:08,047 --> 01:11:10,515
- Where is she? Did she come down yet?
- Nope.

1001
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:14,642
- Why didn't you wake me?
- It's the only time I've seen you happy.

1002
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,983
Shit.

1003
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,957
- Mr. Hannigan.
- Now, that's the important one.

1004
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:23,754
- Mr. Hannigan.
- Oh, you came to say goodbye.

1005
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:26,955
- Make sure the Italians...
- No. Do you have the money?

1006
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:28,463
I gave it to your sister.

1007
01:11:28,634 --> 01:11:31,831
And I'll tell you, I've had some fucks,
but she is up there.

1008
01:11:32,004 --> 01:11:34,871
- Make sure the Germans are...
- Hold on. You can't leave.

1009
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,008
- She hasn't come down yet.
- What?

1010
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:40,407
We had a deal, okay?
She hasn't come down yet.

1011
01:11:40,913 --> 01:11:44,906
Just give me five minutes to make
sure it's okay. You can't leave yet.

1012
01:11:46,352 --> 01:11:49,617
You're a rich man.
You got what you wanted.

1013
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:51,380
Be happy.

1014
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:54,855
It better all be there!

1015
01:12:24,857 --> 01:12:26,825
- Here you go.
- A check?

1016
01:12:27,526 --> 01:12:29,926
You accepted a fucking check?

1017
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,958
Did you look at it, Richard?

1018
01:12:33,298 --> 01:12:35,926
It's certified by the bank.
It's the same as cash.

1019
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,968
I know what it is.
He didn't have time to do it.

1020
01:12:39,138 --> 01:12:43,131
- We set the price yesterday afternoon.
- He had checks for different amounts.

1021
01:12:43,308 --> 01:12:48,439
He had one for 750, one for 900,
one for $ 1.2 million, so...

1022
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,048
- ...got off cheap.
- How do you know?

1023
01:12:51,216 --> 01:12:54,151
The hotel has an executive
assistant service.

1024
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:57,720
- We did it for him.
- Same as cash.

1025
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:02,554
All right.

1026
01:13:02,728 --> 01:13:04,855
We have 45 minutes
before the bank opens.

1027
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,725
- Okay.
- I gotta make a call.

1028
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,495
It's over.

1029
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,969
It'll never be over.

1030
01:13:20,446 --> 01:13:23,210
No, I mean, this business.

1031
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:25,043
Yeah, so do I.

1032
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:30,612
How's Michael?

1033
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,119
He'll be okay.

1034
01:13:44,036 --> 01:13:46,061
I'm sorry, man.

1035
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:47,969
For what?

1036
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:51,541
You know, I thought you were trying
to fuck me.

1037
01:13:52,444 --> 01:13:55,641
If I were trying to fuck you,
you'd be fucked.

1038
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,809
Listen...

1039
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:01,209
...I've been thinking about it.

1040
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:03,946
I'm sorry about what
my sister pulled last night.

1041
01:14:04,123 --> 01:14:06,648
I'm gonna bring you back up
to 20 percent.

1042
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:12,760
What? I can't make a gesture?
You did a good job yesterday.

1043
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:16,298
- It's a surprise.
- Yeah, well, it's still minus expenses.

1044
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:18,325
Thanks.

1045
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,362
- They'll be out front.
- Thank you.

1046
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:25,804
Come here. Come here.
I want to talk to you. Come here.

1047
01:14:29,181 --> 01:14:33,174
Listen, Val, I'm...

1048
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:41,623
Thank you.

1049
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:59,408
The Jew's gonna have an aneurysm
when he finds out about this.

1050
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,740
And a new partner on top of it?
He's gonna be pissed.

1051
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,144
You know what?

1052
01:15:05,317 --> 01:15:09,617
We should just call this a one-time-only
thing, you know? Just split the cash.

1053
01:15:09,788 --> 01:15:11,346
What are you talking about?

1054
01:15:11,523 --> 01:15:13,150
I don't wanna keep doing this.

1055
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:15,555
I wanna use this money
to get myself going.

1056
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:18,696
You'll spend it. Six months,
you'll be where you started.

1057
01:15:18,864 --> 01:15:21,230
Maybe, yeah, but it's my choice.

1058
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:25,232
Fine. Fuck it. Unbelievable.

1059
01:15:25,404 --> 01:15:26,928
- Hey, wait...
- Gene, no.

1060
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:30,131
- Get over there!
- Let me explain, will you? Come on!

1061
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:32,743
I need to go see Teddy,
then I'm coming to you.

1062
01:15:32,911 --> 01:15:36,005
I want my money now, fucker!

1063
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:38,812
Gene, just relax.

1064
01:15:39,818 --> 01:15:41,649
What the fuck is this, huh?

1065
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:44,050
You wanna get killed
over a fucking check?

1066
01:15:44,223 --> 01:15:46,691
- What did you do with the money?
- I hid it...

1067
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:50,055
- I didn't want to risk being robbed again.
- Give it to me.

1068
01:15:51,697 --> 01:15:53,221
No.

1069
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:56,799
No, if you kill me, there's no money.

1070
01:15:57,736 --> 01:15:59,533
- Then I kill him.
- Gene, please.

1071
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:01,229
Okay, go ahead.

1072
01:16:01,406 --> 01:16:03,806
- I'll kill him, I will.
- Man, shit happens.

1073
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,173
Brian! He's a fucking junkie!
Just give him the money!

1074
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,772
- No.
- No?!

1075
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:11,848
- No.
- Why?

1076
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,078
You said "fucking check."

1077
01:16:15,254 --> 01:16:18,712
- What?
- You said "check" instead of "cash."

1078
01:16:19,258 --> 01:16:22,318
- I didn't say check.
- Yes, you fucking did!

1079
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:24,752
I didn't say check.

1080
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,058
Yes, you did. You said check.

1081
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:30,360
- Goddamn it!
- Caught me on short notice!

1082
01:16:30,535 --> 01:16:34,528
- I didn't have time to prepare.
- Get the fuck out of here, you sack of shit.

1083
01:16:34,706 --> 01:16:38,699
- But I needed 50 for the gun.
- Fuck your 50! Get out of here!

1084
01:16:39,244 --> 01:16:42,270
Now you see why I need you? Huh?

1085
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:44,711
Fucking incompetent.

1086
01:16:46,652 --> 01:16:47,949
What?

1087
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,348
What? Oh, you're hurt?

1088
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:52,012
What's with the raped-virgin look, huh?

1089
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,954
You know what I do. I had to try.
What do you expect?

1090
01:16:55,127 --> 01:16:57,254
- Yeah, something.
- Yeah, well, come on.

1091
01:16:57,429 --> 01:17:01,365
- The bank's open. Give me the check.
- No way. I carry the check.

1092
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:05,128
You give me that check.
This is my deal. I'll carry it.

1093
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:20,418
- So just find somewhere to wait.
- Why?

1094
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:25,546
Because I look like a businessman
and you look like a fucking cholo, okay?

1095
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,056
Just blend in. I'll find you.

1096
01:17:31,997 --> 01:17:35,933
Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me.
I have a check I need to cash.

1097
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:37,864
It's from the bank here.

1098
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,736
Can you wait here just a moment?

1099
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,505
A sum this large I have to clear
with the manager.

1100
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,977
- Sure.
- Just a formality.

1101
01:17:50,148 --> 01:17:52,673
Absolutely. I meant to call
before I came over...

1102
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:55,786
...but my office had me all tied up.
- No problem.

1103
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,018
- Excuse me, Mr. Gaddis?
- Yes.

1104
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,681
- I'm Joel Strumpel, the manager.
- How do you do?

1105
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,088
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1106
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:39,196
Would you mind stepping into my office
for a moment?

1107
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:42,162
- Is there a problem?
- It's just a formality.

1108
01:19:05,123 --> 01:19:06,351
Sir?

1109
01:19:19,037 --> 01:19:20,902
Relax, sir.

1110
01:19:23,275 --> 01:19:25,903
Calm down, sir. Just calm down.

1111
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:30,611
- Get the fuck off me!
- Relax!

1112
01:19:33,618 --> 01:19:35,449
Get him to his knees.

1113
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,214
Stand straight up, sir. Stand straight up.

1114
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:40,918
Do you have any weapons?

1115
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,963
All right, let's take him back to the bank.

1116
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,461
We're bringing him in.

1117
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:18,446
Show your cards.

1118
01:21:21,726 --> 01:21:24,786
- Hey, did everything go okay?
- Yeah. Just fine.

1119
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,590
Good.

1120
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:32,162
Should be careful with that, guys.
Might be worth something.

1121
01:21:32,337 --> 01:21:33,804
Not a fucking chance.

1122
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,497
Come on, how did we do?
Did it go okay?

1123
01:21:36,675 --> 01:21:38,267
Yeah, we did okay.

1124
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:39,910
- You were scared.
- I was not.

1125
01:21:40,078 --> 01:21:42,774
Stop being so coy. Give us details.
We want details.

1126
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:45,974
Okay. Did he run?
Tell me if he tried to run.

1127
01:21:46,451 --> 01:21:47,850
He tried to run.

1128
01:21:48,019 --> 01:21:52,115
I told you he'd try to run.
I just wish I would have been there.

1129
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:55,958
Hey, I thought you said
you were gonna quit smoking.

1130
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,195
- Your dad says so.
- You're smoking. You're hot.

1131
01:21:59,764 --> 01:22:03,165
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- You! Yes, you are.

1132
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,899
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

1133
01:22:12,444 --> 01:22:14,605
Don't quit your day job.

1134
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,107
You okay?

1135
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:19,875
Now I am.

1136
01:22:20,051 --> 01:22:23,714
The estate is being transferred
to me and Michael this morning.

1137
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,048
Thank you.

1138
01:22:28,793 --> 01:22:30,351
I have something for you.

1139
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,120
- You do?
- Yeah.

1140
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:33,525
It's very special.

1141
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,690
It belonged to my grandmother
and her mother before her.

1142
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:38,836
That is beautiful.
