00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,207
[car starting]

183
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:57,391
[Ray] Yeah, I'll come see you
next Sunday, I promise you.

184
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,175
[dogs barking]

185
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,307
Okay, I gotta go.

186
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,438
Yeah, I gotta go. mom.

187
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,526
Okay? I gotta go.

188
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:03,745
Yeah, I'll call you later. Bye.

189
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,660
-[knocking at door]
-[dogs barking]

190
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,232
Come on. Come on,
Come on, come on,
come on. Inside.

191
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,495
Jesus Christ,
get the dogs fixed.

192
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,497
[man] Great. Now you want me
to emasculate my dogs?

193
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,803
Go and get them laid.
They're too excitable.

194
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:22,198
[sighs] Right.
They're guard dogs.

195
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,808
Will you ever consider
an alarm system?

196
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,376
Like the kind
you so confidently disarm?

197
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:32,252
Listen, my dogs are not just
ordinary dogs, you know.

198
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:33,862
They're Egyptian
Pharaoh Hounds.

199
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,733
Otherwise known as
the Ibicenco.

200
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:39,389
They have been pure-bred
since 3000 BC.

201
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,218
Ray, those dogs aren't even
the same breed.

202
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,003
Yeah, well, Molly.
Molly is a bit of a stray,

203
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,440
but, you know, she has
the heart of an Ibicenco.

204
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,312
[laughs] Man,
you're so full of shit.

205
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,401
Five for the pearls.

206
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:52,750
Five?

207
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:53,969
Do you know what those
go for at Bulgari's?

208
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,362
They're rare.
Makes them hard to move.

209
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,886
Check out the diamonds. Derco.

210
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,757
Shame to break up the settings.

211
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,194
Some of these are scratched.

212
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,456
Fuck you, Ray.

213
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:03,805
Probably when you
took them out.

214
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,328
Look, I know
how to handle stones.

215
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,808
If they're scratched,
then that's the way I got them.

216
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,419
[smacks lips] Seven.

217
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,464
-Twelve.
-Eight.

218
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,031
Don't treat me
like a junkie, Ray.

219
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,209
Eight five.

220
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,341
And that is the best I can do.

221
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,082
That is more than 20%.

222
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:23,651
[chuckles softly] 20%.

223
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,914
Twenty-percent.
That's the story of my life.

224
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,177
And what do I got to do
to get a 100? [chuckles softly]

225
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,966
You know, you should...
You should get out
of this crap.

226
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,839
You know, you should go back
to lumberjack state
or wherever it was,

227
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,016
and just read books
about kings.

228
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,541
"True hope is swift, and flies
as swallow's wings..."

229
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,284
I don't remember. [chuckles]

230
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,983
"Kings it makes gods,
and meaner creatures..."

231
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,769
"...Kings." Right.
See what I mean?

232
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:55,987
That just comes out of you.

233
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,077
It's incredible,
you could do so much better.

234
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:00,557
So could you, Xi.

235
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,260
[birds chirping]

236
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,494
[door creaking]

237
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,679
[crow cawing]

238
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,598
[Xenia] Hello, snake rancher.

239
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:47,561
I'm looking for
a Suriname Red Tail Boa.

240
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:48,605
Very exotic.

241
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,173
Hard to find.

242
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,480
Yeah, well, I hear they run
like crazy from people.

243
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,918
Well, some breeds

244
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,138
handle Homo Sapiens
better than others.

245
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:01,792
How did you find me?

246
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,579
I asked around
the snake grapevine.

247
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:06,754
There's not that many of you.

248
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,801
Well, I'm not going to ask
how you got in.

249
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,195
Front door.

250
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,544
Ooh.

251
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,286
-Left it open, huh?
-Hm.

252
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,549
Ha! How silly of me.

253
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,511
So, do you do this often?

254
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:26,513
What?

255
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,428
Just walk into men's houses.

256
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,560
No, I just wanted
to see a snake ranch.

257
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:32,693
[glasses clink]

258
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,521
[Xenia] They look happy.

259
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,740
Yeah. You, uh, give them food,

260
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,481
shelter, warmth...

261
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,789
Maybe even some love?

262
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,835
[laughs] Snakes
don't need a lot.

263
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,837
Too bad you can't say
the same thing about people.

264
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,973
[Bram] This is
a Burmese python.

265
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:58,806
[chuckles nervously]

266
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,853
[chuckles softly]

267
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,855
You didn't strike me
as a squeamish type.

268
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,553
No? How do I strike you?

269
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,295
Barbed wire with perfume.

270
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:17,564
Sometimes I'm scared shitless.

271
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,653
Well, fear's just

272
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,307
nature's way
of making you smart.

273
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,312
Come on, buddy.

274
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:37,540
So why did you come?

275
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,020
I just wanted to know
the truth I guess.

276
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,327
And?

277
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:44,547
I haven't decided.

278
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:47,985
Ah, so it doesn't matter
what I say.

279
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,989
Well, it never matters
what people say.

280
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,382
It's what they do.

281
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,820
So...

282
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,782
If I wanted you to leave...

283
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,438
[ice tray cracking]

284
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,483
...how do I get you out?

285
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,398
You could call the police.

286
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:10,921
[Bram laughs]

287
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,754
Or you could just tell me
that you want me
to leave and I'll leave.

288
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,801
[glasses clinking]

289
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:24,718
I didn't say that...

290
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,764
I want you to leave.

291
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,812
You didn't say anything.

292
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,686
[Bram] Do I have to say?

293
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,431
Tell me that you don't want me.

294
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:47,915
I didn't say.

295
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,440
I didn't want you here.

296
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,447
[Xenia] Tell me that
you don't want me.

297
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,105
[Bram] I didn't say
I didn't want you.

298
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:06,890
[Xenia] Tell me that...

299
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:13,941
Tell me...

300
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,726
[breathing heavily]

[metal clinks]

306
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,803
So these rated
for half-inch steel cable?

307
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,413
Oh, you bet.
It's got a ten-year guarantee.

308
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,675
You're looking at the best.

309
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,199
[cell phone ringing]

310
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,208
Hello.

311
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,035
[Bram on phone] 
What do you wear?

312
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,084
Nothing.

313
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,173
When can I see you?

314
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,263
When do you want to see me?

315
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:11,221
Now.

316
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,049
-Uh...
-[honking]

317
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:15,835
Running some errands?

318
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,360
Can you hang on a second?

319
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,156
And where are you?

320
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,029
Oh, I'm out about.

321
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,161
I miss you bad.

322
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,904
How bad?

323
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:42,992
Real bad.

324
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,170
I lie down, I smell you 
on the pillow.

325
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,389
Then change the sheets.

326
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:53,089
I feel your hands on me 
when I wake up at night.

327
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,395
Take a shower.

328
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,094
Oh, I need to wash off.

329
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,443
Look, I'm busy tonight.

330
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:02,490
Do you think you can defer
some gratification?

331
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,275
Oh, well, no, no,
I'm bad at that.

332
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,321
Tomorrow.

333
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:08,365
How about a picnic?

334
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:12,021
Sounds perfect.

335
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,109
I'll make it worth your wait.

[instrumental music playing]

337
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:23,293
[Xenia] First the Indians,
then the settlers.

338
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:24,643
and then the rich people.

339
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:28,342
[Bram] That's the deal.

340
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:31,214
People hang on to things
until somebody rips them off.

341
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:46,882
I thought this was
supposed to be a picnic.

342
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,362
It is.

343
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,451
A very special little picnic.

346
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,867
What is it, Xenia?

347
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,260
This is Cassie Michael's house.

348
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,915
-She asked me to cat sit.
-Oh.

349
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:21,700
Like to meet Cassie sometime.

350
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,614
Well, she's in Portland
for a few days.

351
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,487
She just called me
and asked me to feed the cat
and water the plants.

352
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:32,275
It's Mayan Snake God, Chac.

353
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,016
It's worth fifty thou,
give or take.

354
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:38,847
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

355
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,546
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

-[cat meowing]
-Hello, you.

357
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:46,028
You hungry? Hm?

358
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,290
You hungry?

359
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:48,944
So this was a good idea, huh?

360
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,384
So how did you meet Cassie?

361
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,823
We're getting our legs waxed.

362
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,520
[chuckles]

363
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,565
They're pouring this
hot gunk all over us, you know,

364
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,437
and Cassie turns to me
and she says,

365
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,527
"Maybe you can save
my evening primrose."

366
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,398
Well, then the wax
starts to harden

367
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,836
and she wants to hold my hand
because she's scared.

368
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,188
I don't know,
there's something,

369
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,799
something about pain,
you know, even...

370
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:20,846
stupid girly pain like that.

371
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:26,460
Anyway, afterwards she had me
do her entire garden.

372
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,334
She has the most beautiful
evening primrose.

373
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:37,123
Did you know
that evening primrose
only blooms at night?

374
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,346
Nothing but the best
for girl Cassie, huh?

375
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:44,434
[Xenia] Hm.

376
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:45,522
[glasses clink]

377
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:16,586
Hey, Colin.

378
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,327
Hey, Brammy.

379
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,763
Hey, buddy, wait up.

380
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,417
Hey, check this out.

381
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,637
Last night, some guy
steals a pink Merc.

382
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,248
-Now, who the fuck
would steal a pink car, huh?
-[laughs]

383
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,729
Oh, man, drugs, cops.
We all getting done.

384
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,558
Yeah, it's the lead, man.
in the air.

385
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,516
Things were a whole lot simpler
ten years ago.

386
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:35,170
Ah, you're missing the uniform.

387
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,780
I don't miss the uniform.

388
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:38,304
But I liked it when we were
partners, you know?

389
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:39,522
[Bram] Yeah, me too.

390
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,266
[chatter]

391
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,447
[telephone ringing]

392
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,246
[dramatic music playing]

393
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:16,342
[indistinct announcement]

394
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:19,519
[chatter]

395
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,303
[honking]

396
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,746
-[Colin] Hey, Bram.
-Colin.

397
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,749
Mind if, uh, I look around?

398
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,491
Might be related to something
I've been working on.

399
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,102
Sure.

400
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,713
We got a guy and a gal
gardening across
the street saw them.

401
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:42,542
Walks in, polish off
a $300 bottle of champagne

402
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:43,673
and the caviar.

403
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:45,980
Lifts some priceless
pre-Colombian gizmo

404
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,722
and three hundred fifty grand
worth of stones.

405
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,725
-Jesus Christ.
-Can you believe it?

406
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,857
The woman kept her jewelry
in the fucking deep freeze.

407
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,338
Read an article somewhere
that said it would
survive a fire.

408
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,472
-Forcible injury?
-Uh-uh.

409
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:02,431
Maid was fired last week.
Took off to Guadalajara.

410
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,564
The perp had a key, alarm goes.

411
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,522
knew the occupants
were out of town.

412
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:07,567
Help yourself.

413
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:10,178
[officers chattering]

414
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,269
[camera shutter clicking]

415
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,797
-[officer] Yeah, I guess
it's temporary.
-[camera shutter clicking]

416
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,846
[officer chattering]

417
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,896
[Colin] Bram, what the fuck?

418
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:34,768
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

419
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,640
I never had $300 champagne.

420
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:40,556
Man, I got enough problems
without you mixing
your prints in.

421
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:41,557
I'd have you arrested.

422
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,299
Yeah, you know,

423
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,475
I've been doing
dumb shit like that all day.

424
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,782
You know, it's the lead, right?

425
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

426
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,001
Look, I'll
get out of your hair.

427
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,742
It's not my guy's style
anyway, right?

428
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:53,743
Forget about it.

429
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,573
[sighs]

430
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:07,017
[siren wailing in distance]

431
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,367
[man] You don't worry.
I'll go check.

432
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:14,547
Good evening.

433
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,165
[instrumental music playing]

434
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,395
[siren blaring]

435
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:50,730
You gonna bust me, Bram,

436
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,210
you better wait till you can
find more in my car

437
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,386
than a spare tire
and a bottle of Obsession.

438
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,218
Get your dirty
cop hands off of me!

439
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,704
You have a very interesting
investigative style, don't you?

440
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,750
Ever occur to you that I didn't
want to make this arrest?

441
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,926
Yeah, right. You just happened
to meet a woman in a bar,

442
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:14,101
and what a coincidence,

443
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,537
she's a crook and you're a cop,

444
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,583
and you just happen to have
a fucking book on her?

445
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,759
I mean, come on.

446
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,762
Opposites attract, but that
strikes me as a slight
compatibility problem.

447
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:25,025
Xenia, I was at that bar
because your car was spotted

448
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,027
near a robbery
a couple of months ago, okay?

449
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,596
I was backgrounding you,
all right?

450
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,772
How the hell did I know
you were gonna come in?

451
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,252
When you did, well...

452
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,907
I was attracted to you,
all right? Hey.

453
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,039
Hey! I tried to bail.

454
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:41,476
You hunted me up, remember?

455
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,825
-After that...
-Yeah, and after that,

456
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,871
you developed a little

457
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:47,830
conflict of interest.
Is that fair?

458
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:50,485
Yeah, well, you could safely
say I forfeited my case. Yeah.

459
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:54,707
And what does that mean?

460
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,449
It means you just
committed grand larceny
and I don't give a damn.

461
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,233
I don't want us to end.

462
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,453
And what makes you think
this isn't already over?

463
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,108
Look, I'm still a cop, okay?

464
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,069
All I ask is that
you don't rub my face in it.

465
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,767
When we're together,
if we're together, that...

466
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,030
Just leave out the part about
how we earn our daily bread.

467
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,945
So I just keep my mouth shut

468
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:18,426
and go on being
acrobatic in bed,
and I don't have to worry?

469
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:19,558
That's not what I said!

470
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,995
Look, you know,
I am not exactly

471
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,040
what you would call
an upstanding citizen.

472
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,391
All right? I routinely
break six out of the ten
commandments,

473
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,567
-but I've got...
-You told me you were
a garden consultant!

474
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:29,655
That's all I want to know!

475
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,534
Here's your goddamn file.

476
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,841
I never turned it in.

477
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:43,451
Nobody downtown
knows you exist.

478
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:49,109
You play kinda fast and loose,
don't you?

479
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,331
Ever since I met you, yeah.

480
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,336
Then I guess
I haven't been very good
for you, then, have I?

481
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:02,775
Maybe been too good.

482
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,435
Hey, the world's full of rules.

483
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,134
In the end, you got
to answer to yourself.

484
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:36,330
[breathing heavily] What if
they found out?

485
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,898
I'll be suspended,
probably fired.

486
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:40,943
[both breathing heavily]

487
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:57,003
[chattering]

488
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,961
Here you go.
Lettuce and something.

489
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:01,921
[sighs]

490
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:03,879
How come every day
these things look worse?

491
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,881
I don't know, man,
because they are.

492
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,103
That Verdugo job.
Anything come in?

493
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,192
Yeah. They find your prints
all over the goddamn place.

494
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:14,063
Besides me.

495
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:17,371
Well, a lovely couple
had loved practice
along with their champagne.

496
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,592
[laughs] Made themselves
right at home.

497
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:21,854
Yeah, sounds like fun.

498
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,725
Oh, yeah. You're telling me.

499
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:26,728
Anything else?

500
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,253
What do you mean
"anything else"?

501
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,081
Yeah. A whole group
of extraterrestrials

502
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,909
came in this morning
and confessed.

503
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,520
"Anything else."

504
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,695
That the hell are you talking
about? What do you care?

505
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:37,870
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,741
Hey! My new tie.

507
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,924
[Xenia breathing heavily]

508
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,928
[exhales loudly]

509
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:55,801
Mm.

510
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,455
What is the matter with you?

511
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,416
I think I am bored
with the country life.

512
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:05,027
You can't... You can't
spend a whole day

513
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:07,769
potting, watering damn plants.

514
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,380
Yeah, well... [grunts]

515
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,208
[straining]
Read a book or something.

516
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,296
I don't like sitting around.

517
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:15,255
I want to... I want to move.

518
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:16,952
I want to go somewhere.

519
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,998
I mean, dance. I mean,
you didn't have
a radio in there.

520
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:20,129
Do you have a radio?

521
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,435
No, I don't think so.

522
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,176
-So you want to dance?
-Yeah, I wanna dance.

523
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:25,265
Huh? Well, come here.

524
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,876
-How about this?
-[Xenia laughs]

525
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,095
What the hell is that?

526
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:31,097
Oh, some kind of
strange two-step.

527
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:33,708
-Do you mind?
-No, I mean like...

528
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,231
You know, escape velocity?

529
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:36,885
-You ever heard of that?
-No.

530
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:38,931
It's the speed that, um,

531
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:42,108
that a rocket needs
to get beyond gravity.

532
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,240
Well, I want to go
that fast sometimes.

533
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:47,940
Oh, is that why you steal?
So you could go fast? Escape?

534
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,942
-No, I steal because
I'm good at it.
-Well...

535
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,639
I mean, why are you a cop?

536
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,033
Good question.

537
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,818
Well, I thought it was because
you liked being a good guy.

538
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,994
Well, every cop likes
being in a good guy.

539
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,475
You know...

540
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:04,130
Good and bad, they're just
concepts of the system

541
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,262
that fell apart
a long time ago.

542
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:08,003
[Bram] I'll tell you a story.

543
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:10,179
A couple years ago,
I'm up for a promotion.

544
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:14,401
And I catch this guy
with a hot stereo.

545
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,143
Now he's living in this...

546
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:21,147
crap hole of a van
with the wife, couple kids.

547
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:24,280
The guy, he's so scared
he can't even talk.

548
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,283
But the wife, she is
begging me to let him go.

549
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,982
So I tell them... [straining]

550
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:32,245
just keep the damn stereo
and get out of town.

551
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,639
The next day,

552
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:38,947
he is busted for crack.

553
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:42,168
-Mm. [laughs]
-And he's wailing for me.
Mr. Mercy.

554
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,780
Next thing I know,
I'm on probation

555
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,349
in this asshole I trained
is my boss.

556
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:52,047
Mm. And look at you now.

557
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:55,485
And now you're having
an illicit love affair
with a crook.

558
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,792
Now you're spending
all your time

559
00:42:57,923 --> 00:42:59,881
slinking around in secret.

560
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:04,233
All right, all right.
I know you're restless.

561
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:06,584
Are you hungry?

562
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:12,328
Yes.

563
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:16,942
[Xenia] I was 17 and his name
was Constantine Alexakos.

564
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:19,161
But everybody
called him "Connie".

565
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,469
And he did, he did a lot
of second-story work.

566
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,037
And I used to always ask him
if I could go with him,

567
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,430
and he would always,
always tell me no.

568
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:30,825
Until finally,
one day I got to him.

569
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:34,220
I'll not tell you
how I got to him.

570
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,091
-All right.
-I really got to him.

571
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:38,354
And after that first house,
I thought...

572
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:41,227
this is it.

573
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:45,318
But his specialty was safes.

574
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:49,104
One day we were doing
this big old Schneider.

575
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:52,194
You know, which...
The tumbler's the size
of a dinner plate,

576
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:56,111
and this piece of C-4
went off in his hand.

577
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:59,375
I mean, I'm standing there
and I'm watching him,
and it's like... Boom!

578
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:03,205
And all this blood is spurting
and his index finger
is just gone.

579
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,860
-And then, we spent...
-[both laugh]

580
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:09,124
We spent the next
five minutes looking for it.

581
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:10,952
-[laughs]
-Not to save it.

582
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,302
You know, but because
it had his print on it.

583
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,219
-[Bram chuckles]
-I...

584
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,960
I don't do safes anymore.

585
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:23,138
My favorite public servant!

586
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,792
My favorite public ass.

587
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:26,968
Ricky Madden.

588
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,709
Xenia Kelly.

589
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,059
-You're not really
going out with this guy...
-Yes, I am.

590
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,149
Now, Madden, be civil,
just shut up and
get out of here.

591
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,368
What do you do, Mr. Madden?

592
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:36,891
Well, he's a lawyer.

593
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:39,285
-A criminal... lawyer.
-[both laughing]

594
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:41,330
Well, you know, you don't
look like a lawyer.

595
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,158
Well, thank you.

596
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,944
I don't really think
of myself as one.

597
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:47,902
Now, isn't that right,
Mr. Hatcher?

598
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:50,339
See, um, along the way,

599
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,300
some of his beach body
has got caught up
in the dope he is.

600
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,129
Now, you're the one
that keeps him
riding the waves, aren't you?

601
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,000
You know, Xenia,

602
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,046
it's tough being a cop.

603
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:03,526
You watch people break the law
and get away with it.

604
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,572
Watch him get rich...

605
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,879
Get your goddamn hands off her.

606
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:10,359
...bust your ass
and come up empty.

607
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,275
-But then...
-I said, get your hands off.

608
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:17,149
Detective Hatcher'd like
to think of himself
as arctic white.

609
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:18,716
But could it be,

610
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:22,415
he's a couple of notches
down on the grays...

611
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,373
-[man 1] Hey, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
-[man 2] What's going on?

612
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:26,811
[both grunting]

613
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:28,856
[gun cocks]

614
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,425
[Ricky] Be careful, Brammy boy.

615
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:35,297
Be very, very careful.

616
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:40,694
All right, folks, I hate
to break this up,

617
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,435
but who'll be taking care
of this check?

618
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:51,096
I think this one's on you,
Mr. Madden.

619
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,968
[Ricky chuckles softly]

620
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:03,804
[thunder rumbling]

621
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,425
[Bram] Come back.

622
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:18,863
I can't sleep without you
anymore. I wake up.

623
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:20,821
[Xenia] I gotta go.

624
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:22,954
Is this a job?

625
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,132
We don't discuss
business, remember?

626
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,923
You want to come
with me, don't you? Hm?

627
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:39,840
What, are you bored up there?

628
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:52,940
All right, hot stuff.

629
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:57,815
Teach me.

630
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:01,427
I work alone.

631
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,778
Well...

632
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,563
-You said that I'd be good.
-Yeah, I said you would
be good at it.

633
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,565
I didn't say that
I wanted a partner.

634
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:10,828
[Bram] Why?

635
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,614
[Xenia] Well, because sooner
or later, they let you down.

636
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:20,489
I don't want
to be your partner.

637
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,144
I wanna be your student.

638
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:31,326
You had Connie.

639
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:34,634
Let me have you.

640
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:36,462
So you wanna learn
how to be a thief?

641
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:39,073
Hm?

642
00:47:39,204 --> 00:47:40,248
You wanna learn how the...

643
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:42,860
case prospects and...

644
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,385
the security systems,

645
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:49,649
tell real from fakes?

646
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:56,177
Risk getting shot?

647
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:00,573
-[breathing heavily]
-Hm?

648
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:06,013
You wanna do that again?

649
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:13,542
[Bram moans]

650
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:15,327
What if we get caught?

651
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:18,373
[straining] You willing
to do time?

652
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:20,071
-Huh?
-[grunts softly]

653
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,292
Are you willing,

654
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:26,947
in your heart of hearts,

655
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:29,645
to cross over?

656
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:30,559
Huh?

657
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:42,093
[instrumental music playing]

658
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,447
[ominous music playing]

659
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:52,641
[bottle rattling]

660
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:07,047
[objects clattering]

661
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:10,268
[car approaching]

662
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,146
Let's go.

663
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:25,500
[indistinct murmurs]

664
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:38,731
[grunts]

665
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,051
[gun cocking]

666
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:06,237
[gun cocking]

667
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,342
Don't move, asshole,
or I'll fucking kill you!

668
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:26,648
Drop it, now!

669
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:30,913
On your knees.

670
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,741
I said, on your knees,
Get down on the fucking floor!

671
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:41,750
You alone?

672
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,103
Who else is here?
Answer me, damn it!

673
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,018
Talk to me, motherfucker!
Or you're dead.

674
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,543
You want to fuck
with me, asshole? I'll blow
your fucking head off!

675
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:52,544
[gunshot]

676
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:12,085
Hey.

677
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,609
If you're out there,
we need an ambulance on Elmont.

678
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:24,967
[police 1] Two peeps.
Through the back door!

679
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:25,881
[police 2] All right,
I got it, I got it!

680
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,146
[police 1]
Through here, up here!

681
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:37,545
[both grunting]

682
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,471
[sirens approaching]

683
00:52:53,779 --> 00:52:55,476
[Xenia] Oh, God.

684
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:57,086
He'll be okay.
You got him in the shoulder.

685
00:52:57,217 --> 00:53:00,612
Your partner?
Your fucking partner?

686
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:02,744
He used to be
before I made detective.

687
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,572
Shit, I never shot a man.

688
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:06,661
Jesus God, a fucking cop.

689
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:08,794
But nobody knew you were there.
He didn't fucking see ya.

690
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:10,491
He saw me.

691
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:13,146
He's got brown eyes, right?

692
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:16,541
Well, his brown eyes
looked into mine
and he saw me.

693
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,064
Listen to me.

694
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,761
There's no way he could ID you.

695
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:21,415
The sun was blasting in
behind you.

696
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,504
You saw him,
he didn't see you.

697
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:25,593
We're gonna lay low
on ride this thing out.

698
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:28,205
Bram, there are gonna be
cops crawling
all over the fucking place.

699
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:30,119
You know, they all get
a fucking heart attack

700
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,513
when somebody shoots
a cop, like cops matter
more than anybody else.

701
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,820
-We do.
-Oh, "we".
That's a hot one.

702
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,040
Look, I'll monitor
the police bands.

703
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,651
I'll see how bad
things really are.

704
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:41,783
As soon as word's had
a chance to get out,

705
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,350
I'll look in on Colin
at the hospital.

706
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:44,873
I'm coming too.

707
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,137
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

708
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:49,791
Look, I shot a man.
The least I can do is

709
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:50,966
have the balls to go see him.

710
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:52,533
Xenia, you do
something crazy like that,

711
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:53,969
you're gonna fuck us up.

712
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,755
Now, just relax,
have a few beers,
take a warm bath.

713
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,496
Oh, you think
a fucking bubble bath
is gonna fix this?

714
00:53:58,626 --> 00:53:59,627
Just sit tight, all right?

715
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:00,976
[ship horn blaring]

716
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,023
[groaning]

717
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:06,721
I tell you, buddy.
it was worth to get shot at.

718
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:10,159
That night, nurse babe
catheterized me.

719
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,814
I get a hard on
just thinking about her
putting on them rubber gloves.

720
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:14,555
[Colin laughs]

721
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:16,949
-[Bram clears throat]
-Huh?

722
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:20,648
-And this is...
-Xenia.

723
00:54:20,779 --> 00:54:23,042
-And you're Colin.
-I am.

724
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:25,653
I'm sorry we have to meet
under these circumstances.

725
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:28,917
Don't. I'll be happy
to meet you under
any circumstances.

726
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:32,617
You know, I had a feeling
there was something
he wasn't telling me.

727
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:34,706
Work with a guy for ten years,

728
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:36,142
you know when
he's holding out on you.

729
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,404
I brought you some medicine.

730
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,406
Hey-hey!

731
00:54:39,537 --> 00:54:41,800
Where'd you find this girl?

732
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,107
She found me. I was minding
my own goddamn business.

733
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,457
So did they catch who did it?

734
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:49,460
Well, we, uh, we know
we're looking for a lady.

735
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,722
Really?

736
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:51,897
-Yeah.
-What kind of lady?

737
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:54,160
I don't know. I didn't
get a good look at her,

738
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:58,077
But she was young, and a fox,
almost as pretty as you.

739
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,602
Oh, maybe I should
rob some houses.

740
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:02,560
I could use the money.

741
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,735
[Colin laughs]

742
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:06,041
It was weird, you know,
this guy was,

743
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,217
It's like, he knew
what I was gonna do
before I did.

744
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,568
When you ever heard
of a guy look away

745
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:12,265
when you're pointing
a gun at him, huh?

746
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:14,354
Must not have been
his first bust, huh?

747
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:15,660
Yeah.

748
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,575
[groans softly]

749
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:19,490
You better call
Florence Nightingale,
I need some more drugs.

750
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,406
[indistinct chatter over PA]

751
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:33,068
What the fuck is
the matter with you? Fuck!

752
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,809
It was a test
that he flunked, okay?

753
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,029
How do you know that?

754
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,160
I don't know that.
I think that, all right?

755
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,161
It doesn't matter.

756
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:41,120
Are you fucking suicidal?

757
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,121
I mean, I'm doing
everything I can

758
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,949
to keep our asses
out of the slammer,

759
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,343
and you go making
a cameo appearance before
the only goddamn witness.

760
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:50,651
You just can't stay away
from fucking flame, can you?

761
00:55:58,311 --> 00:56:01,009
Come on. I thought you were
some kind of tough bitch, huh.

762
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,228
What's that,
some kind of compliment?

763
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,665
Look, it is just his shoulder.

764
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:07,102
It is not gonna
fuck up his life.

765
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:08,843
And who're you to say
what's gonna fuck up
somebody's life?

766
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:19,158
Look, just go home, dammit.

767
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:20,855
Huh?

768
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,814
You nervous or something?

769
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:27,645
Lay low, all right?

770
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:40,875
[phone ringing]

771
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:44,749
[phone ringing]

772
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:48,753
Hello.

773
00:56:48,883 --> 00:56:49,623
[Bram] What are you wearing?

774
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:51,973
Nothing.

775
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:56,195
I miss you. What are you doing?

776
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:58,850
I'm getting the tools
out of the house.

777
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,766
I rented a storage locker.
Don't think it hurts
to be too careful

778
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:03,071
[man knocking at door] Hello!

779
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:04,899
C-Can I call you back?

780
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,599
-Hello?
-[door opens and closes]

781
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:11,166
[Colin] Hi.

782
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:12,254
Hi.

783
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:13,168
It was unlocked.

784
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:15,954
-It was?
-Yeah.

785
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:18,130
You should be more careful.

786
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,742
Oh, my God.
What are you doing out of bed?

787
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:24,005
I just got a couple extra
holes in me, that's all.

788
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,791
I thought I'd stop by
and, uh, thank you
for the flowers

789
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:27,879
You're welcome.

790
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:31,839
-I just need these for driving.
-Oh.

791
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:33,754
Well, this is nice.

792
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:35,277
Thank you.

793
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:36,888
Yeah. Bram tells me
you're in the flower business.

794
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:39,673
-Uh, well, garden consulting.
-Uh-huh.

795
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,022
Did you catch that, lady thief?

796
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:44,417
No, not yet, but we will.

797
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:47,333
Listen, Xenia,
there's something
I got to ask you.

798
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,902
The day I got shot,
according to the police report,

799
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:52,643
there's a car like yours
spotted near the scene.

800
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:53,905
Really?

801
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:55,776
Where?

802
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:58,213
Body Bay Road,
around 4 o'clock
Thursday afternoon.

803
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:01,260
Hmm. Well, I go
up there sometimes,
but not last Thursday.

804
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,870
Oh, oh.

805
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:04,176
We didn't have
any license plates.

806
00:58:04,306 --> 00:58:06,787
Just, uh, you know,
one of them dealer things

807
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:08,180
you get when they're
new, you know

808
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,357
Listen, Xenia,

809
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:15,796
You were once convicted
of passing bad checks,
weren't you?

810
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:23,064
I was eighteen.

811
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,153
I got a suspended sentence.

812
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:26,677
You make a lot of money
telling people what to plan.

813
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,854
Are you serious?

814
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,986
Hey, look, because you've got
a record, I gotta ask, right?

815
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:34,293
Right, you're serious.
aren't you?
You're serious.

816
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:35,860
I was young,
and I made a mistake.

817
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,818
And as you can see,
I got myself straightened out.

818
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:38,819
Okay?

819
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:40,038
Okay.

820
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:42,867
Might I have have
a look around?

821
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:43,868
Yes, I...

822
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:45,130
Yes, I do.

823
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:46,697
I do mind.

824
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:52,354
Well, uh, here's my number.

825
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:54,095
In case anything comes up
you want to tell me.

826
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:55,706
-All right.
-All right?

827
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,894
-How dare you!
-What?

828
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,330
You know what!

829
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,679
Hey!

830
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,115
Bram!

831
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,074
A car like hers was spotted
near the scene,

832
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,075
and she has a criminal record.

833
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:18,250
You know that?
Of course I know that.

834
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,034
What are you,
fucking sixteen or something?

835
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:22,080
Hey, what the hell's
the matter with you, man?

836
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,125
It's routine, Bram.
You know that.

837
00:59:24,256 --> 00:59:25,257
You'd have done
the same thing yourself.

838
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:29,043
Let me tell you something
as a friend.

839
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:31,263
Before stepping out,
I checked for
quicksand, mister.

840
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:36,137
Colin, I love this girl.

841
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:38,966
You say a fucking word
against her without
having something solid,

842
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,577
you do anything that hurts her,

843
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:42,927
So help me God, man...

844
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:45,712
So help me God.

845
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:16,090
He died this morning

846
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,759
Mummy, why are you
doing this?

847
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:46,120
-Mummy, what are you doing?
-I belong here.

848
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:50,429
He left you.
He left us.

849
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:55,129
He was a very proud man.

850
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,610
He didn't want us to know
how bad off he was.

851
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:01,353
He always sent us money
when he could.

852
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:03,790
[scoffs]

853
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:07,751
I was a good wife.

854
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:14,758
Mummy...

855
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,154
You're not still
married to him.

856
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:24,158
I told everybody
we were divorced.

857
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:26,160
It was easier.
It was easier on you.

858
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,988
[groans softly]

859
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,390
Xenia, he's still your father

860
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:46,964
And you better learn
to love him the best way
that you can.

861
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,262
[sobbing]

862
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:39,756
[inhales]

863
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:54,901
[car approaching]

864
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,231
Hi.

865
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:23,451
What's wrong?

866
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,410
Nothing.

867
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:31,372
My father died

868
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,507
I'm sorry

869
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:41,905
It's gonna be a funeral?

870
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,168
No, thank God.

871
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:46,039
I spent the day
talking my mother out of it.

872
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,128
Instead, she'll get
a little urn of his ashes

873
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:49,826
to obsess over
for the rest of her life

874
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:02,012
Bram, I thought you said
you were gonna get rid of this.

875
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:03,970
I told you to dump
the fucking gun.

876
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:05,624
I am going to.

877
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,452
-You're getting sloppy.
-Xenia.

878
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:09,236
Colin is looking
for his shooter.

879
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:12,065
I know him. He is
not going to let up.

880
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:13,893
I'm going to help him find her.

881
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,764
As soon as I can,
I'm gonna slip the gun
into the evidence lockup

882
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,115
hanging on some cute
little gang girl corpse.

883
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:20,334
Colin gets his lady,
case closed.

884
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:22,641
Gonna stick a shooting I did
on some dead person?

885
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:24,643
-Gets calling off our backs.
-No.

886
01:04:24,773 --> 01:04:26,079
This is not a good time
to discuss this.

887
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:27,864
You're still thinking
like a cop.

888
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:29,735
You think you can do
whatever the fuck you want.

889
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,911
"Some dumb shit crackhead.
What the fuck does she matter."

890
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,957
-Is that how you think
-You know why
you don't like it?

891
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:36,133
Because it's not down
to the letter, exactly
what you've been doing

892
01:04:36,263 --> 01:04:37,874
for your ten glorious
years of crime?

893
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:39,440
"It's not the book,"
according to convict.

894
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,139
That's right.
I had a way of doing things,
and it worked

895
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:43,183
Xenia.

896
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:48,145
Come on, hey, hey.

897
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:53,150
We're fucking up.

898
01:04:54,368 --> 01:04:55,500
We're starting to fuck up.

899
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,676
No, we're not.

900
01:04:57,806 --> 01:05:00,200
We're getting out, we're
gonna go someplace else
to start over.

901
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:02,420
We don't have enough.

902
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,377
It doesn't matter.

903
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:04,596
Yes, it does.

904
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:09,862
I don't want
to live like my mother,

905
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,385
and I don't want to die
like my father

906
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:23,484
[Bram] We need somebody
filthy rich.

907
01:05:23,615 --> 01:05:25,225
It's got to be new money.

908
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:27,880
[Xenia] Yeah, somebody
who hasn't learned
how to take care of it yet.

909
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,970
Yeah, like, uh, dealer,
bag man or something.

910
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:35,714
What about, uh,

911
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:38,760
Nah.

912
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:39,805
Come on, who?

913
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,241
Nah, forget it.
No, come on.

914
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:43,156
We have to think
of every possibility.

915
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:48,248
Just think about
maybe Ricky Madden.

916
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,338
That obnoxious guy
at the restaurant?

917
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:52,296
Yeah.

918
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:55,386
He scrubs money, right?

919
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,171
He's perfect.

920
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:01,522
Forget it. We tried to get
a bug into his house

921
01:06:01,653 --> 01:06:03,176
a couple of years ago,
it's like Fort Knox

922
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:05,352
Except...

923
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:08,877
I think maybe he moved.

924
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:12,098
Come on, he's such an ass.
I'd love to hit him
just on general principle.

925
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:13,665
Come on, Xenia.

926
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,232
He's got a new place.

927
01:06:15,362 --> 01:06:16,233
It'll be tougher
than his old one.

928
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:23,109
Unless he's still
getting moved in

929
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,337
[Bram] So what's
the entry point?
Skylight?

930
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:34,599
[Xenia] It's probably late.

931
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:36,644
But maybe the system's
not all hooked up yet.

932
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:39,082
Yeah, because maybe
there's nothing in there
to steal yet.

933
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:41,388
Yeah, but suppose there is,
you don't put up
an electric wire

934
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:43,608
unless you got
something to protect.

935
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,566
[Bram] Slow down
a little bit, will you?

936
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:48,004
This place is built
with drug money.

937
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:51,398
That just means that Madden
can't report the theft.

938
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,792
It also means
that man's friends
are serious people.

939
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:55,576
The cops get you,
you do time.

940
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:57,796
Madden's friends get you,
you're dead.

941
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:00,146
I got you.

942
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:02,540
I could live without
whatever's in there.

943
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:05,760
I can't.

944
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:07,240
I want it as bad
as I want you.

945
01:07:10,983 --> 01:07:14,117
[Bram] We're gonna
need information.

946
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:17,642
All right, my gut tells me
it's a Sapphire
security system.

947
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:20,645
The usual lace job
plus passive infrared.

948
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:22,212
If that's up and running,
we're fucked.

949
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:23,778
I can do it.

950
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:25,432
Oh, come on.
You can't go near
one of those things.

951
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:26,564
I said I can do it.

952
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:29,828
Yeah, well, all right,
let's say you can.

953
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:33,049
He keeps his money
in a wall safe.

954
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:36,269
Guy said it's one of those
big custom Moslers,

955
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,662
that moves the money
every day or two.

956
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:39,968
On the other hand,
his pattern's consistent.

957
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:42,884
Makes his calls
from a pay phone.

958
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:45,713
Goes to that restaurant
every afternoon about 4:00.

959
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:49,195
Drinks, has dinner and stays
until about 9:00.

960
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:11,739
-Ready?
-Go.

961
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:17,093
[Xenia] One, two, three.

962
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:28,713
[alarm beeping]

963
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:34,110
[beeping continues]

964
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:37,548
[beeping stops]

965
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,264
[alarm beeping]

966
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,272
[grunts]

967
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,624
[sizzling]

968
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:17,196
No keys.

969
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:19,329
That would have been too easy.

970
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:32,646
who

971
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,796
Don't worry,
it won't explode... yet.

972
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:12,355
-Ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

973
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,966
[drilling]

974
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:18,883
[drilling noise continues]

975
01:11:24,889 --> 01:11:25,933
[lock disengages]

976
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:29,676
[drilling noise stops]

977
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,815
Xenia, you have
done this before, right?

978
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:40,208
Yeah, with Connie.

979
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:43,560
Like Connie was there
while you did it.

980
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:44,952
Like Connie was there
when I was watching him.

981
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,696
Jesus Christ.

982
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:51,829
Bram, you're disturbing
my concentration

983
01:12:04,537 --> 01:12:05,886
[ticking]

984
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:17,637
-Get going.
-You're gonna be okay?

985
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:18,725
Yeah.

986
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,870
You meet pretty women
in the most unexpected places.

987
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:37,353
You'll forgive me.
I've forgotten your name.

988
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,920
Xenia.

989
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:43,794
Last time we met, Xenia,
you were with a guy.

990
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:47,101
Bram Hatcher,
officer of the law.

991
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:48,581
I'm glad this time
you're by yourself.

992
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,456
Don't disappoint me
and tell me he's here too.

993
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:55,849
I work alone.

994
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:58,025
This isn't a social call.

995
01:13:00,332 --> 01:13:01,464
If you get that gun
out of my face,
then maybe we could chat.

996
01:13:03,683 --> 01:13:06,947
I feel naked without it.

997
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:09,863
Of course, it's not
a bad thing with a girl
that looks like you.

998
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:15,565
-I'm not armed.
-That is stupid.

999
01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:21,745
I call you a woman in jeopardy.

1000
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,747
Is that a prelude
to a rape that I can't report?

1001
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,664
No.

1002
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,928
That'd ruin my story.

1003
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:36,063
That I killed an intruder
in self defense

1004
01:13:41,286 --> 01:13:42,548
[gunshot]

1005
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:43,506
[screams]

1006
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:50,948
[hyperventilating]

1007
01:14:04,265 --> 01:14:06,529
This is one time you can
thank me for bringing a gun.

1008
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:08,879
[bell ringing]

1009
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:22,980
[alarm ringing]

1010
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,603
That's it, come on,
let's go.

1011
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:40,737
[tires squealing]

1012
01:14:58,842 --> 01:15:00,757
-Oh, my God.
-Xenia?

1013
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,193
-Bram, I think
I'm gonna be sick.
-Xenia!

1014
01:15:03,455 --> 01:15:06,023
-Xenia!
-Oh, God!

1015
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:08,329
He's dead, he's dead.

1016
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,332
I got to go back
to the station.
tie up loose ends, huh?

1017
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,073
No, I can't be alone.
Please, I don't
wanna be alone.

1018
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:14,771
Please, please.

1019
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,600
I need to feel you
next to me, please.

1020
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,340
Fuck me.

1021
01:15:19,471 --> 01:15:21,125
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1022
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:37,750
[Xenia] I shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

1023
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:39,447
You were a cop, you know.

1024
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,537
You were, you were a good cop,
and I just, I made you dirty.

1025
01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:44,322
Hey.

1026
01:15:47,064 --> 01:15:47,978
We're in this together.

1027
01:15:50,023 --> 01:15:50,850
All the way.

1028
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,333
Let's go home,
get your passport,

1029
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:56,682
leave you
at the airport at dawn.

1030
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:00,294
We'll take the first flight
out of the country.

1031
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:04,864
-God.
-Xenia...

1032
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:07,911
I'm sorry.

1033
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,695
-Hey.
-I love you.

1034
01:16:09,826 --> 01:16:11,871
-Hey.
-I love you.

1035
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:17,747
[footsteps approaching]

1036
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:23,709
[Colin] Hello, Xenia.

1037
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:30,237
You know, some of this
is very interesting.

1038
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:33,850
Harvesting purple prairie
cornflower seeds
with dust buster.

1039
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,591
You come by
for some gardening tips?

1040
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,900
You know, Xenia, I have
a special interest
in this case.

1041
01:16:41,031 --> 01:16:43,163
Not only because I got shot,

1042
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:44,948
because I keep hoping
I'm gonna find out

1043
01:16:45,078 --> 01:16:46,906
that Bram's only involved
in this from the waist down.

1044
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,956
Oh, by the way, your place
is whistle clean.

1045
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:53,870
Found nothing.

1046
01:16:54,914 --> 01:16:57,961
Well, almost nothing.

1047
01:16:58,091 --> 01:17:02,139
Complete specs
for Sapphire security
alarms systems.

1048
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:04,576
What's this, a little
late night reading
before bedtime?

1049
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:06,143
It this illegal
to own a technical manual?

1050
01:17:06,273 --> 01:17:07,840
Hmm?

1051
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:11,061
You know, this would
even qualify
as circumstantial.

1052
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:12,628
And while we're at it,
you haven't shown me
your search warrant.

1053
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,151
I don't have one.

1054
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:17,415
File a complaint.

1055
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,898
You know where I found that?
In your closet.

1056
01:17:22,028 --> 01:17:23,290
In a jacket. A man's jacket.

1057
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,684
Bram's jacket.

1058
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:28,078
Well, then why don't you
go to his house then
and sit in the dark?

1059
01:17:29,427 --> 01:17:31,124
Well, maybe I should.

1060
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:32,996
Trouble is, I hate
those goddamn snakes.

1061
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:38,349
Be seeing you soon, Xenia.

1062
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:45,312
[knocking at door]

1063
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:46,357
Yeah!

1064
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:48,402
[dog barking]

1065
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,363
What's going on?
What's going on?

1066
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:54,191
Things are getting hot.

1067
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,975
So many tools and stuff.
Just get rid of them,
all right?

1068
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:58,978
There's more in
my storage locker.
Here's the key.

1069
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:01,154
Just get rid of that, too.
Okay?

1070
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:02,808
Just keep... Whatever,
whatever sell it for,

1071
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:03,461
just, just keep it.

1072
01:18:04,244 --> 01:18:05,681
You okay?

1073
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,466
Gonna get you a drink.

1074
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,134
Ray, where'd you get this?

1075
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:25,222
What?

1076
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:30,662
The pre-Columbian, the snake.
Where did you get it?

1077
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:33,665
That's Chac.
That's a Mayan snake god.

1078
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:35,145
God damn it, Ray,
Where did you get it?

1079
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:39,062
-Client.
-Who?

1080
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:40,367
Hey, I don't ask you
any question.

1081
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:41,760
Which client?

1082
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,110
Was it Bram Hatcher?

1083
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:49,159
Like you, Xe, I owe
all my clients discretion.

1084
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:52,684
Cut the shit, Ray.

1085
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:54,338
You goddamn
know Bram, don't you?

1086
01:18:56,383 --> 01:18:58,037
How do you know Bram?

1087
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:02,912
Ray, I said
how do you know Bram!

1088
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:04,391
Come on, cut that shit out!

1089
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:05,915
Tell me the truth now.

1090
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:07,917
Yeah, I know him, all right?

1091
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:09,266
He's a cop.

1092
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:11,224
He busted me once.

1093
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:13,574
Said I could continue
in this business
if I paid him off.

1094
01:19:13,705 --> 01:19:15,402
Pay him off how?

1095
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:16,926
-Cash.
-What else?

1096
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:20,886
Was it information? Huh?

1097
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:25,412
You're a snitch, aren't you.

1098
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:28,764
You're a fucking snitch.

1099
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,766
Sometimes.

1100
01:19:32,419 --> 01:19:36,119
Look here, I wasn't
snitching on you, Xe.

1101
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:38,730
A guy comes to me
with a big job
he's not talking about.

1102
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,732
Asked me who's
the best I knew at B&E.

1103
01:19:40,863 --> 01:19:43,126
Someone to do
a third floor break in.

1104
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:44,997
Top of the line alarm system.

1105
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:47,130
-Sapphire.
-Sapphire?

1106
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:49,262
Yeah.

1107
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:51,438
He said that?
He said Sapphire
specifically?

1108
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:55,703
Asked me if I knew
anybody who did safes.

1109
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:58,054
I told him you did.
I wasn't sure
if you still did.

1110
01:19:58,184 --> 01:19:59,142
What else?

1111
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:03,842
Something to do in
and unoccupied building.

1112
01:20:05,365 --> 01:20:06,410
He said that was
very important.

1113
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,200
When was this?

1114
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:15,854
It was way before Christmas.

1115
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,119
Why didn't you tell me?

1116
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:22,252
I didn't want to go to jail.

1117
01:20:23,557 --> 01:20:25,516
I wouldn't make it
in there, Xe.

1118
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:27,910
You look like an all round
win-win-win situation.

1119
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,259
[phone ringing]

1120
01:20:29,389 --> 01:20:32,610
Ray. Look, Ray, I'm not here.

1121
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,307
I'm not here.
And we never talked.

1122
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:37,615
-Okay?
-Okay.

1123
01:20:39,051 --> 01:20:40,313
[phone ringing]

1124
01:20:47,364 --> 01:20:49,453
[phone continues ringing]

1125
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:03,946
[phone beeps on]

1126
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:04,860
Hello?

1127
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:06,600
[glass shattering]

1128
01:21:07,558 --> 01:21:09,038
[thumping]

1129
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:10,256
[dog barking]

1130
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,651
Oh, God.

1131
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,305
Ray.

1132
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:16,480
Oh, shit.

1133
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,134
Oh, shit.

1134
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:20,919
Xe. Xe...

1135
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:26,446
Hang on, Ray.
The hospital's close.

1136
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:27,665
I'm fucked, Xe.

1137
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:32,278
Come on, Ray, come on.
Get up. Come on.

1138
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:34,280
Come on, Ray.
The hospital's close.

1139
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,501
Come on, Ray.
Shit! Come on, Ray!

1140
01:21:40,504 --> 01:21:42,332
The worst that can
befall thee...

1141
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:43,637
Fuck you.

1142
01:21:43,768 --> 01:21:46,336
-Measur'd right.
-Get up! Get up.

1143
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:47,337
Finish it.

1144
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,688
-Finish it.
-Fuck you, Ray.

1145
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:52,690
Get up! Get up!

1146
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,909
[sobbing]

1147
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:59,479
Is a sound slumber

1148
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,438
and a long good night.

1149
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,744
Please, get up, Ray.

1150
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:05,572
Please. Please!

1151
01:22:06,573 --> 01:22:08,445
Please, Ray. Please.

1152
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:10,447
Please.

1153
01:22:12,362 --> 01:22:13,450
[sobbing]

1154
01:22:14,407 --> 01:22:16,018
Please, Ray.

1155
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:51,140
[door opens]

1156
01:22:58,799 --> 01:23:00,236
[keys jingling]

1157
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:07,156
Xenia?

1158
01:23:08,461 --> 01:23:09,636
I'm here

1159
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:24,347
You okay? Huh?

1160
01:23:25,652 --> 01:23:27,654
We go a change of plan.
Where's the money?

1161
01:23:29,308 --> 01:23:30,875
-I hid it.
-You hid it?

1162
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,095
I got, I got nervous.
I didn't want it around.

1163
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:36,620
I put it in a sewer pipe.
It's under
the Tannhauser bridge.

1164
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:39,014
I got some bad news.

1165
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:41,886
There's a fence, you know him.
Ray Costello.

1166
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:46,412
He got, uh, picked up tonight.

1167
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:48,806
He's downtown now,
copping a plea.

1168
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:51,765
Spilling his guts
about you and your career.

1169
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:53,506
So we've gotta get you
out here of.
This place is gonna be

1170
01:23:53,637 --> 01:23:55,769
swarming with cops
and about five minutes.

1171
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:56,988
Don't worry.
I've worked this out.

1172
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:58,642
Just listen to this.
Listen, all right?

1173
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:01,949
-Okay.
-They know that I'm here.

1174
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,603
I asked to make
the collar myself.

1175
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:05,866
Like, uh, like
I'm gonna bust you. Right?

1176
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:07,390
Now, this is the way
we're going to do it.

1177
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,783
You're gonna, you're gonna
to shoot me here in the thigh.

1178
01:24:09,914 --> 01:24:11,133
Don't worry.

1179
01:24:11,263 --> 01:24:13,048
It'll go through clean.
It'll heal up quick.

1180
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:15,789
It'll take away any suspicions
that I let you go.

1181
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,184
I'll scream, "Freeze, police!"
all that shit real loud

1182
01:24:19,315 --> 01:24:22,448
so the neighbors can hear,
then fire a couple of shots
in the air.

1183
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:24,059
But you just keep on going.
You follow?

1184
01:24:26,626 --> 01:24:27,671
Xenia.

1185
01:24:28,672 --> 01:24:30,543
We got no choice.

1186
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:32,632
Things got fucked,
they got fucked, but
we're gonna make it. Okay?

1187
01:24:32,763 --> 01:24:34,678
We'll just get you
out of town, I'll lay low
a couple of months,

1188
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:36,680
we'll figure it out.
Don't cry, don't cry.

1189
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,471
You got to do this.

1190
01:24:45,602 --> 01:24:47,865
Don't worry about hurting me.
I'll be okay, all right?

1191
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:02,880
God damn it, Xenia!

1192
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,621
Listen to me,
you've got to do this.

1193
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:11,584
[groaning]

1194
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:15,414
Freeze! Police!

1195
01:25:17,373 --> 01:25:18,417
[grunting]

1196
01:25:19,549 --> 01:25:20,289
Drop the gun.

1197
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:23,509
Drop the damn gun!

1198
01:25:24,031 --> 01:25:24,858
Go!

1199
01:26:08,075 --> 01:26:09,164
[gasping]

1200
01:26:55,471 --> 01:26:56,472
Bye, Mummy.

1201
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:18,711
Shit.

1202
01:27:47,174 --> 01:27:49,612
[dialing]

1203
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:52,702
[cell phone ringing]

1204
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:11,764
[phone continues ringing]

1205
01:28:16,856 --> 01:28:18,075
Yeah?

1206
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:19,468
Is it Colin?

1207
01:28:19,598 --> 01:28:21,557
Just listen to me, all right?
There's a fence.

1208
01:28:21,687 --> 01:28:24,647
His name is Ray Costello.
Ray Costello.

1209
01:28:24,777 --> 01:28:26,518
He was murdered tonight.

1210
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:28,868
And I know this is
hard for you to believe,
but Bram killed him.

1211
01:28:28,999 --> 01:28:30,435
Okay? You've got to help me.

1212
01:28:30,566 --> 01:28:31,784
Please help me.

1213
01:28:31,915 --> 01:28:34,961
Well, Xenia. 
How nice of you to call.

1214
01:28:38,487 --> 01:28:39,792
Why?

1215
01:28:39,923 --> 01:28:41,533
You were always telling me
to break the rules.

1216
01:28:41,664 --> 01:28:42,752
What made you think
I wouldn't break yours?

1217
01:28:42,882 --> 01:28:45,102
I'll explain it better
when I see you.

1218
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:47,974
You won't find me.

1219
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:51,500
I'm a cop, remember? 
I could put out warrants in 
all 50 states if I have to.

1220
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,589
Real pretty photos.

1221
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:54,981
Whatever it takes, 
I'll find you.

1222
01:28:56,113 --> 01:28:57,941
I'll talk.

1223
01:28:58,071 --> 01:28:59,812
I'll go down, but I'll talk.

1224
01:28:59,943 --> 01:29:02,032
And tell them what?
We dated a couple of times

1225
01:29:02,162 --> 01:29:03,816
I dropped you, that's it.

1226
01:29:03,947 --> 01:29:05,862
The rest you made up.

1227
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:08,691
I caught you planting evidence. 
It's old stuff, but it works.

1228
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:12,956
I'll make sure of that.

1229
01:29:16,307 --> 01:29:18,657
And now, there's...

1230
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:21,007
There's nobody left
to back up your story.

1231
01:29:24,881 --> 01:29:25,882
Nobody.

1232
01:29:56,608 --> 01:29:57,609
[car door opening]

1233
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,741
I don't think
that's biodegradable.

1234
01:30:46,789 --> 01:30:49,226
What's in the bag, Xenia?
Money.

1235
01:30:52,316 --> 01:30:53,143
Why?

1236
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:56,929
You gonna frame me?

1237
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,192
Call the cops,
come back, get it later
when I'm in jail?

1238
01:31:01,804 --> 01:31:05,460
I think maybe...
you better go get it

1239
01:31:49,721 --> 01:31:50,505
Open it.

1240
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:07,609
Just money? Money,
that's all you wanted?

1241
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:12,527
All I wanted?

1242
01:32:15,268 --> 01:32:17,401
You know, my whole
goddamn life changed

1243
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:18,707
when you came into the picture.

1244
01:32:20,317 --> 01:32:21,927
I mean, I was even
trying to improvise

1245
01:32:22,058 --> 01:32:24,756
so this whole thing
could work out for us.

1246
01:32:24,887 --> 01:32:26,715
I told you I didn't need
that goddamn money.

1247
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:28,543
All I needed was you.

1248
01:32:28,673 --> 01:32:32,677
But you? You wanted
the money as much as me.

1249
01:32:32,808 --> 01:32:33,548
You know?

1250
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:38,030
We could've been partners.

1251
01:32:39,423 --> 01:32:41,164
Madden didn't have to die.

1252
01:32:41,294 --> 01:32:43,340
We could have done
10 Madden jobs
without anyone getting hurt.

1253
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,256
Well, partners.
Fuck you, how you said that.

1254
01:32:48,519 --> 01:32:50,826
Xe, Madden knew
too much about me.

1255
01:32:50,956 --> 01:32:54,133
I was his partner,
his silent partner.

1256
01:32:57,484 --> 01:33:00,139
So much for partners.

1257
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:03,142
I mean, you were better off
before I came
into the picture, right?

1258
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:06,232
You know...

1259
01:33:08,974 --> 01:33:10,585
The only thing
that I didn't count on

1260
01:33:12,978 --> 01:33:14,153
was falling in love with you.

1261
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:21,683
Love?

1262
01:33:21,813 --> 01:33:23,380
Love?

1263
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:24,816
Is that what you call this?

1264
01:33:31,388 --> 01:33:32,302
The toughest part of all.

1265
01:33:36,088 --> 01:33:37,437
So this is how it ends?

1266
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:38,961
You just gonna
shoot fish in a bucket?

1267
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:44,096
I wish we both could've been.

1268
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:52,061
I do love you.

1269
01:33:54,977 --> 01:33:57,414
Well, you can't kill memories.

1270
01:33:57,544 --> 01:33:58,763
And I'll never
forget you, Bram.

1271
01:34:00,025 --> 01:34:00,809
Never.

1272
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:07,119
[grunting]

1273
01:34:10,514 --> 01:34:11,994
I can wait for you forever.

1274
01:34:13,909 --> 01:34:16,085
[ticking]

1275
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:22,700
[bell ringing]

1276
01:35:50,614 --> 01:35:52,268
I'll get you
everything you need.

1277
01:35:53,138 --> 01:35:54,052
Food.

1278
01:35:54,444 --> 01:35:55,445
Shelter.

1279
01:35:56,663 --> 01:35:57,490
Warmth.

1280
01:35:59,536 --> 01:36:01,103
Maybe even a little love.

1281
01:36:01,364 --> 01:36:02,495
Hmm?

1282
01:36:05,063 --> 01:36:06,543
[car starting]
