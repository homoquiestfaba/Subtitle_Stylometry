00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:32,028
Oh, that's good.

189
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,514
You want to see her?

190
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,604
JJ SAWYER: No, no,
I got a deadline.

191
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,648
Are you sure?

192
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:44,519
She'd probably like to see you.

193
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,787
How's she doing?

194
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,137
Took her a few years
to get over my brother.

195
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:58,489
It was a hard time, but, you
know, I was there for her.

196
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,056
You heard about the wedding?

197
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,406
Yeah, congratulations.

198
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,758
[inaudible]

199
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:11,720
JJ Sawyer rolling
into town now.

200
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,896
That is a coincidence.

201
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,810
How's that?

202
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,116
I don't know.

203
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,037
Why not?

204
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,647
Come one, step out back.

205
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,822
Step out back?

206
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
grab your drink.

207
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:31,392
I'm not taking no for an answer.

208
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:32,306
All right.

209
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,964
Where you taking me, Cliff?

210
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:38,965
Fair is fair, JJ.

211
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:39,922
You showed me yours.

212
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,358
I'll show you mine.

213
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:46,233
But before we do...

214
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:49,105
Yeah, all right.

215
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm glad I'm walking, all right.

216
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,204
Wait for it.

217
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,118
I'm waiting.

218
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,032
Wait for it.

[ominous music]

220
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,699
Yeah, you're not dreaming.

221
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:20,180
That's really it.

222
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,050
That's Cutter's car.

223
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,144
I rebuilt it myself.

224
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:36,544
Yeah, I made a few
changes here and there.

225
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,893
You know, make it
good for the street.

226

[screaming]

227
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:53,996
I only just finished
it, and you show up.

228
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,302
Tammy doesn't even
want to look at it.

229
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,264
I'm out of here, Cliff.

230
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,526
You know, it's strange, huh?

231
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,791
I mean, I finish
it, and you show it.

232
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,315
What do you suppose that means?

233
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,229
Doesn't mean anything.

234
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,578
CLIFF: No, it does.

235
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:11,971
It does, JJ.

236
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,233
It can't be a coincidence.

237
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:16,627
This is fate talking.

238
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,151
JJ, listen to me.

239
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:22,155
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt, OK?

240
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,333
It was Cutter, and
he put me up to it.

241
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:29,205
Put you up to what?

242
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:35,603
You car, we sabotaged it.

243
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,126
I mean, he needed his
sponsors, all right?

244
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,041
He needed... he needed Hiroto.

245
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,651
You sabotaged my car.

246
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,093
Son of a bitch.

247
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:47,963
Ah.

248
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:56,754
Cutter had something on...

249
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,191
on one of your pit boys.

250
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:09,158
TAMMY: Hey, hey, what in
the hell is going on here?

251
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,291
What are you doing here?

252
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,074
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:18,080
You OK?

254
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,603
You all right?
- Ah.

255
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:20,517
What happened?

Hey, we need a car.

260
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,720
Some drinking and fast driving
will make you feel better.

261
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,288
That trucker really
kill your dad?

262
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:53,898
How would I know?

263
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,335
Hey, maybe we should
get him to kill mine.

264
00:17:55,378 --> 00:18:00,427
[laughs] Woo.

265
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,434
Oh, ow.

00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:11,046
Show some respect, dude.

Hey.

Thanks.

00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:04,795
OK, wait.

277
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,145
You got to help me.

278
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,581
If you bleed on me,
I'll kick your ass.

279
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:09,235
I got my ass kicked
by a girl, man.

280
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,019
You did.

281
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,195
Whoa, check it out.

282
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,980
Whoa, dude, that is sick.

283
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:16,851
Oh, man.

Let's have some fun.

285
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:18,766
Let's do this.

286
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,074
Check the trunk for a six pack.

See if it's our lucky day.

288
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,076
I will.

289
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,473
Yeah, woo.

Hi, how can I help you?

I'm supposed to
fill out a form.

00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,452
JJ, come on in.

299
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,279
It's OK.

300
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,588
You made it.

00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:42,980
Yeah.

The state police

303
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,070
caught your friend
in a speed check

304
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,029
before he ended up
killing somebody.

305
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,639
That's good.

306
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,816
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Yeah,
what happened to your hand?

307
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,647
JJ SAWYER: Oh, I stuck it
where it didn't belong.

308
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,258
How's your rig?

00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,868
JJ SAWYER: Well, I think I
might need a new mechanic.

Oh, Cliff's the best, JJ.

00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,438
He's good people.

312
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,700
You fill out this part.

313
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:07,614
JJ SAWYER: All right.

314
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,441
Sign it there.

315
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,142
You were the first
citation I ever wrote out.

316
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:18,842
You and Cutter back when
you were both hell raisers.

317
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,844
You didn't have any
time for me, and I

318
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,629
guess I rode you too hard.

319
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,065
You know what, Tom?

320
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,588
I'd rather not reminisce.

321
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,415
Fair enough.

322
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:33,074
I used to drive out to Craig
Loop and see your folks a lot.

323
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,468
They were always
talking about you.

324
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:40,995
Oh, JJ is going to come
back home real soon.

325
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,475
Here you go.

326
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:43,737
Filled it out.

327
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,042
Signed it.

328
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,000
You can write it up
any way you want.

329
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,262
What's your rush?

330
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,220
Hey, what do you
want from me, Tom?

331
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,092
So I didn't show
up for the funeral.

332
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:54,661
That's between me and
them, and my maker.

333
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:58,447
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Right, you
quit on everybody, didn't you?

334
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,754
Let me tell you something.

335
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,496
Nobody blamed you
for that accident.

336
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,062
You did that yourself.

337
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,369
The town lost a hero that day.

338
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:11,112
It didn't need to lose two.

339
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,374
You could learn
something from Cliff.

340
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,030
So could you, Tom.

341
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,749
TAMMY: Compliments
of the management.

342
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:40,924
It's parked out on Main.

343
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,368
So what happened back there?

344
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,195
Nothing.

345
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,849
TAMMY: Funny, that's
what Cliff said.

346
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:57,332
So you just knock out your
old friends for the fun of it.

347
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:02,119
Look, it was my fault, OK?

348
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:03,991
Some hello after 17 years.

349
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,605
Hello, Tammy.

350
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:10,650
You look great.

351
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:11,564
Oh, gee, thanks.

352
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:12,391
So do you.

353
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,573
What are you doing here, JJ?

354
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,704
Leaving.

355
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,750
No, you already did that.

356
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,412
Talk to me.

357
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,589
What do you want me to say?

358
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,287
I don't know.

359
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,202
Stick around for a while.

360
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:42,595
You'll think of something.

361
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:53,083
There's nothing
for me here, Tam.

362
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:53,910
Thanks for the truck.

363
00:23:58,524 --> 00:23:59,438

Let go of the can.

Hey.

369
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:50,070
Let go of the can.

370
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:52,551
Now, why did you have
to go and do that, huh?

371
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,682
Freedom of expression.

372
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:54,509
Oh, yeah?

373
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,037
Hey, put me down.

374
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:02,648
I will scream rape.

375
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:03,823
You start screaming, Picasso.

376
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,529
Hm, you keeping
busy, huh, Jess?

377
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,618
JJ SAWYER: Yeah,
painting my truck.

378
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,489
I though you'd be
long gone by now.

379
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,403
Same here.

380
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,667
What's your excuse?

381
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,842
One of the perks of the job.

382
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:30,458
I see your canvases are
improving, young lady.

383
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,417
Nothing personal, but it means
we don't have to clean it up.

384
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:35,637
Yeah, well, somebody has to.

385
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,812
Take it up with her mother.

386
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,640

389
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,784
No more of this crap.

390
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:14,545
I should have buried
you a long time ago.

391
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:17,853
[rattling noises]

392
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:35,784
Come on, Jesse.

393
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:36,611
Let's go.

394
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:41,921
You?

395
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:43,052
It's great having
you back, JJ.

396
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,710
[music playing]

397
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:49,668
This is nuts.

398
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:59,286
[inaudible] I'm going to
tear your guts out, and then

399
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,202
I'm going to crush you.

[humming noise]

401
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:13,692
Cutter?

402
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:21,221
You sure do pick
your spots, don't you?

403
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,570
Look who's talking.

404
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:24,659
Look, Jess,
Sheriff Hodges is not

405
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,357
going to keep doing us favors
just because he's a friend.

406
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,664
Whatever.

407
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,492
What do you want from me?

408
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,668
I want you to think
about what you're doing.

409
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,409
OK, all right.

410
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:36,715
I want you to be responsible.

411
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,368
Oh, yeah.

412
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,501
Like hanging out at speed
ways and partying and getting

413
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:42,242
knocked up.

414
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:45,549
Jess, I want you to
do better than me, OK?

415
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:48,683
Yeah, you wouldn't want
me repeating your mistake.

416
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:52,600
That's not what I said.

417
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:53,514
Yes, it is.

418
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:56,865

[knocking on door]

421
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:03,062
DEPUTY JACKSON: Sawyer.

422
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,585
What's up?

423
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:05,804
Do you mind opening your
trailer for me, please?

424
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,810
What for?

425
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:12,680
Just open it.

426
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,033
Great.

427
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:18,817
Knock yourself out.

428
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,081
I need you to do it.

429
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,014
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

430
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,192
Yes, sir.

431
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,889
A head.

432
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:51,240
[music playing]

433
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:00,119
OFFICER: I'm just going to
need you to stay right here.

434
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:00,989
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Robbery.

435
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,516
He shows up, tries to stop it.

436
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,389
Then they cut
his head off, yeah.

437
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:13,349
Unless they took the car
to make us think a robbery.

438
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,481
Then they meant to kill him.

439
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:15,351
Yeah.

440
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:20,443
Who'd have it out for Cliff?

441
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,923
And want to cut off his limbs.

442
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,926
Listen, I got
Sawyer inside waiting.

443
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,796
Good, thanks.

444
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,499
She's going to take
your statement.

445
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,642
You mind telling me
why I'm sitting here?

446
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:46,948
SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
You don't know?

447
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,559
No, all I know is
one of your deputies

448
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:53,955
came sniffing around my
truck looking for a head.

449
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:58,351
It seems that
Cliff has lost his.

450
00:31:58,394 --> 00:31:59,961
His head?

451
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:07,229
Yeah, I hear you two had
a real knockdown drag out.

452
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,753
JJ SAWYER: Yeah,
yeah, but when I left,

453
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:11,538
his head was firmly
attached to his shoulders.

454
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,062
You can ask Tammy.

455
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:15,455
Does she know?

456
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,979
She found the body.

457
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,068
Oh my God, I got to see her.

458
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,679
Not so fast.

459
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:24,551
Come on, Tom.

460
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:25,726
Now, why would I
do that to Cliff?

461
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:26,596
Why?

462
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,989
Come on.

463
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,512
SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
You know the story, JJ.

464
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:32,167
It's practically a
legend around here.

465
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,777
Yeah, well, in case
you've forgotten,

466
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,431
I'm the one that lived it.

467
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:39,044
Now, if anybody was out
for revenge after 17 years,

468
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,132
it would be him.

469
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,568
Not me.

470
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:42,873
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: So
Cliff wanted revenge.

471
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,701
JJ SAWYER: I said if.

472
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:47,139
All he wanted was
to show me his car.

473
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:50,490
That is a real coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

474
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:51,317
Oh, yeah.

475
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:57,540
Yeah, that'll be real
neat, wouldn't it, Tom?

476
00:32:57,584 --> 00:33:00,848
Every legend needs it's bad guy.

477
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:04,591
Well, I know you're
a quitter and a loser.

478
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,767
I just wondered how
far you'd fallen.

479
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:10,989
Sir.

480
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,789
What you got, Ron?

481
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,790
Besides the obvious?

482
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:30,965
Yeah.

483
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,880
Vehicle went over
him post-mortem.

484
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,100
You mean they cut his head
off and then drove over him?

485
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,057
Mm.

486
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,015
Man, that's mean.

487
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,407
Mhm.

488
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,757
I make the time of death
approximately 9:00 PM.

489
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:41,845
9 o'clock last night.

490
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,282
Are you sure about that?

491
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,587
Yeah, give or take.

492
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,024
OK, thank you.

493
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,547
What's wrong?

494
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:53,118
Well, JJ was in our office
at 9 o'clock last night.

495
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,597
OK.

496
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:57,905
[ominous music]

497
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,954
What could I have
learned from Cliff

498
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,001
that I don't already know?

499
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,133
That I didn't do it.

500
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,438
I didn't kill him.

501
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:12,920
I can't ask him
that, but in my office

502
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,748
you said I could learn
something from Cliff.

503
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,879
Would you care to
be more specific?

504
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:23,191
You can go.

505
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:40,469
They sabotaged my car.

506
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:43,472
Cliff and Cutter.

507
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,691
That's what caused the accident.

508
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:45,779
Cliff told me.

509
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,650
That's why we got into it.

510
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,870
Sounds a lot like a motive.

511
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:50,653
I didn't do it.

512
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,137
Go now.

513
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,312
JJ SAWYER: Well,
there's something else.

514
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,102
The car.

515
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,755
What about it?

516
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:10,456
JJ SAWYER: It's crazy, but
when Cliff showed me that car,

517
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:14,024
it was like Cutter
was still in it.

518
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,114
Like he never left
after the accident.

519
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:24,252
You better get out of here.

521
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,010

JESSE: You're never
honest with me.

You just say what you
think I want to hear.

525
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:56,545
How many of many of my dads do
you have to kill anyway, huh?

526
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:13,475
Tammy, it's JJ.

527
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:21,788
Tammy.

528
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:30,623
Say, what happened?

529
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,841
They took his head, JJ.

530
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:45,246
Now, Jesse's like a complete
alien, and I don't know.

531
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,204
I don't know.

532
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:46,987
I mean, maybe this is it.

533
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:52,297
This is where I lose her
forever too, you know?

534
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,690
No, don't say that.

535

My family is breaking
into a thousand pieces, JJ.

And you are in the
middle of it again.

Why?

538
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:03,960
I mean, why are you here?

539
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,397
Why did you come back?

540
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,702
Why?

00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:07,747
Why?

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,617
Why, JJ?

Location is the

00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:18,747
I mean, until all his pain
finally caught up with him.

553
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,228
I think Cutter was
Cliff's only gravity.

554
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,755
Then he just started
drinking more and more

555
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:29,715
and obsessing on that car.

556
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:35,373
Then all this stuff with Jesse.

557
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,331
I just thought we were going
to get through it, you know?

558
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:45,383
Has it really been 17 years?

559
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,820
Yep.

560
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,691
And how about you?

561
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:51,824
You tore yourself up
with guilt, didn't you?

562
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,442
JJ SAWYER: You know, Tom
Hodges thinks I did it.

563
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:03,401
Your kid thinks I did it.

564
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:06,665
Who would do
something like this?

565
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,580
How long has Cliff
been working on that car?

566
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:12,061
I don't know.

567
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,280
A year, maybe.

568
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:14,890
Why?

569
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,979
Did he ever say
anything to you about it,

570
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:22,376
about anything that sounded
maybe a little strange.

571
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,988
No, he didn't say anything
to me about it after I told him

572
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,860
I wanted to see it crushed.

573
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:31,124
JJ SAWYER: Well, when
he showed me the car,

574
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,866
I got a weird feeling.

575
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,607
Feeling?

576
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,738
JJ SAWYER: Like
something was in it.

577
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:40,568
Something like what?

578
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:46,879
Like Cutter.

579
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:49,403
Like he never left it.

580
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:54,452
Like... like he was
really pissed off.

581
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:00,370
Like a ghost?

582
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:05,506
And you think that this
ghost is what killed Cliff?

583
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,422
Might be.

584
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,774
My god, you're insane.

585
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,036
No, Tammy, come on.

586
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,950
I...

587
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,169
No, JJ, get out.

588
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:17,039
JJ SAWYER: Look, Tammy...

589
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,127
JJ, get out.

590
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:21,522
[ominous music]

591
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:51,987
Oh.

[phone ringing]

597
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:41,983
Yeah, I got a
little hung up, Chuck.

598
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:43,028
I'm on my way.

599
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:44,029
CHUCK [OVER PHONE]: On your way?

600
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,291
You got to be here already.

601
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:46,901
JJ, do I have to
spell it out for you?

602
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,686
Your job is riding on this.

603
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:51,732
Yeah, not any clearer
than you already have, man.

604
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:52,602
Asshole.

605
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,046
[banging noises]

606
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:12,535
[music playing]

607
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:21,544
OK, OK, OK.

608
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:27,681
JJ SAWYER: Comfy up there?

609
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,422
Crucify me later, dude.

610
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:31,772
I seriously have to pee.

611
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:34,775
Here, use this.

612
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:35,602
Yeah, right.

613
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:44,132
I just love burgers.

614
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:46,874
You know, I could eat
burgers every day.

615
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:48,615
If I had to get a job,
I'd get a job at Mickey

616
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:50,356
D's just for the burgers.

617
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:52,314
Yeah, well,
finish it up quick.

618
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:57,667
You know, I didn't expect
you to dive off like that.

619
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:59,800
Yeah, well, you
could've said something.

620
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,802
Yeah, and I could have emptied
my bladder in your truck too,

621
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:02,803
but I didn't.

622
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:04,283
I was tempted.

623
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,285
Hey, you know, I don't
need this right now, kid.

624
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,329
OK?

625
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,722
I got enough problems of my own.

626
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,029
If I don't get that
car delivered on time,

627
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:14,641
I'm going to be serving
fries at Mickey D's.

628
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:17,905
Just think of the discount.

629
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,603
Call your mom.

630
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,345
No way, I'm not
going back there.

631
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:25,086
Where do you
think you're going?

632
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,261
Well, I don't know.

633
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:27,915
I could stay with
you for a while.

634
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:31,353
You know, just until I
figure something else out.

635
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,442
And how would
that work exactly?

636
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:36,445
Oh, right.

637
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,621
I guess not with you
killing my two dads and all.

638
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:45,150
Look, your mom...

639
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,020
My mom.

640
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:47,935
Hey, listen to me.

641
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,242
Your mom needs you right now.

642
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:53,506
You're all she's got,
and I'm taking you there.

643
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:54,507
So let's go.

644
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,118
No way... give me that.

645
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:58,772
Hey, that is good stuff.

646
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,773
Hey, just come on.

647
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,601
Let's go.

648
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:02,994
You know, you
don't need to take

649
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:04,256
me to wherever you're
going, just drop me off

650
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:05,648
at San Francisco or something.

651
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:06,519
Get real.

[shouting]

654
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:15,397
Come on.

655
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:22,709
That was my dad's car,
and there was no one in it.

656
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:23,536
Just get in the truck.

657
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:47,734
SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
Call the state police.

658
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:50,041
Let them know.

659
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:51,433
TAMMY: Tom.

660
00:47:51,477 --> 00:47:53,522
I don't have time
right now, Tammy.

661
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:54,959
Jesse's missing.

662
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:56,917
She never came home last night.

663
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:59,485
I've already checked all the
usual places, and, you know,

664
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:02,880
she was so upset
about Cliff, and...

665
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:04,142
what?

666
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:05,099
SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
Do you know if she

667
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:08,146
went off with Taz or Owen?

668
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:09,625
Maybe, why?

669
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:12,193
Because somebody
found Taz this morning.

670
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:14,152
He was dead.

671
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:15,370
Owen?

672
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:16,981
SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
They're looking.

673
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,591
No.

674
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:19,766
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: But
there's been no sign of Jesse,

675
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:21,115
so she's probably
still all right.

676
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,464
Probably?

677
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:23,813
We'll do everything
we can to find her.

678
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:25,293
You know that.

679
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,382
But right now, I have a
murder spree on my hands,

680
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,384
and my only suspect
has left town

681
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,472
in the middle of the night.

- Yeah.

some really crazy things

00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:35,347
yesterday.

685
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,957
SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
I know what he said,

686
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:37,436
and I should've locked him
up when I had the chance.

687
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:44,443
What if she's with him?

688
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:46,749
Then we'll bring her back.

689
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,099
I'm going with you.

690
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:49,535
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

691
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,493
Tom Hodges, I'm
going with you.

692
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:04,680
I don't see it.

693
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:05,986
It tried to kill us.

694
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,815
Jess, we're safe
inside this truck, OK?

695
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:09,990
It can't get us in here.

696
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:11,078
Oh, I'm freaking
out right now.

697
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:11,992
JJ SAWYER: Yeah?

698
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,951
Join the club.

699
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,736
OK, there was no
one driving the car.

700
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,651
Whatever's in that car
is after me, not you.

701
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:20,305
Oh, yeah.

702
00:49:20,348 --> 00:49:21,393
It took out half the market
trying to make us road kill,

703
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:22,394
but it's only after you.

704
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,661
Is that what happened to my dad?

705
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,147
Oh, great.

706
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,194
Frankencar, it's alive.

707
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:41,935
You know, I liked it better
when I thought you did it.

708
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:48,986
The car is haunted, isn't it?

709
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,204
How would I know?

710
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:53,642
It's my first Frankencar too.

711
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:55,557
Is it Cutter?

712
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,516
I know he's my real dad.

713
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,474
They told me.

714
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:01,911
Is it him?

715
00:50:01,955 --> 00:50:03,348
I don't know what it is.

716
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,828
I don't.

717
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:09,615
Come on, everyone knows you
two were like mortal enemies.

718
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:11,921
It's just a story.

719
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:15,577
I mean, it's something
they cooked up just to hype

720
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:16,578
the races.

721
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,232
Really?

722
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:21,409
JJ SAWYER: Yeah, Cutter and
me, we used to race around,

723
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:24,673
you know, knock over a
mailboxes, chase girls.

724
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:27,372
I mean, all the
stupid stuff guys do.

725
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:28,286
Some guys.

726
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,201
I mean, we did.

727
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:34,031
Cutter and me, we were friends.

728
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:36,381
Was he like you?

729
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:37,382
Like me?

730
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:38,687
Am I like him?

731
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:41,299
No, you're like your mother.

732
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,736
Ouch, right between the eyes.

733
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:45,912
And you asked for it.

734
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:48,915
[sirens]

735
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,832
Well, speaking of your mother.

736
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,225
Well, this out to be good.

737
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:06,324
What's going on?

738
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,153
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Get out, JJ.

739
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:10,589
Hands behind your head, now.

740
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,243
JJ SAWYER: All right,
take it easy, Tom.

741
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:14,071
Up against the truck.

742
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:14,984
Out of the way, Jesse.

743
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:15,855
What?

744
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:18,640
Up against the truck.

745
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:19,859
What are you doing?

746
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:21,078
Jesse.

747
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:22,427
Hey, I was bringing
her back, Tammy.

748
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,037
It's not his fault.

749
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,299
SHERIFF TOM HODGES: You're
lucky you didn't harm her.

750
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,345
We'd be doing this
Old Testament style.

751
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:28,563
You're making a mistake.

752
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:29,956
Yeah?

753
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:32,001
The only mistake I made
was letting you walk

754
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:33,960
away, you murdering psychopath.

755
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:35,483
It was the car, Tom.

756
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:37,006
Enough of the damn car.

757
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,573
JESSE: He's telling the truth.

758
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:40,445
No, it was dad's car.

759
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:42,142
It was his racer.

760
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,665
I saw it, and it
tried to kill us.

761
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:45,493
JJ SAWYER: Will you
listen to her, Tammy?

762
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,060
Stop it.
He didn't do anything to me.

763
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,496
He didn't do anything wrong.
TAMMY: Jesse, stop it.

764
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,541
Jesse.

765
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:50,498
JESSE: Stop it, let go of me.

766
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:51,369
Let go of me.

767
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:57,940
Hey, Tom.

768
00:51:57,984 --> 00:51:58,985
She's telling the truth.

769
00:51:59,028 --> 00:51:59,899
I'm telling you the truth.

770
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:01,074
All right, let's do this.

771
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,428
[music playing]

772
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:10,388
Get in.

773
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:31,191
[screaming]

774
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,714
Tammy, Jessie, come on.

775
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:33,585
Come on, let's go.

776
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,195
Get in the truck.

777
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,109
JESSE: No, we can't leave her.
- Just get in the truck.

778
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:36,892
Come on.

779
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:42,811
DEPUTY MONROE: I'm stuck.

780
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:45,727
Pull my arm.

781
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:47,076
OK, I'm going to
get you out of there.

782
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,904
I'm going to pull
your other leg.

783
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:52,256
[screaming]

784
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,235
Where'd it go?

785
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:18,673
I don't know.

786
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,675
It's gone.

787
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:22,155
Again.

788
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,069
JJ SAWYER: Yeah, again.

789
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:37,431
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
believe you earlier.

790
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,085
It's all right.

791
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:40,391
I didn't believe
me at first either.

792
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:42,828
I mean, really?

793
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:45,352
It was this car
that killed Cliff?

794
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:46,614
It's haunted, mom.

795
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:48,573
Yeah, that's impossible.

796
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,879
Duh, but this guy's
too nice to say it

797
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:53,926
even though he pretends
to be a jerk face.

798
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:57,364
That car is coming after him
and everyone gets in its way.

799
00:53:57,408 --> 00:53:58,278
And what?

800
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,237
It's haunted by Cutter?

801
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,414
Why would he kill
his own brother?

802
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,807
Ghost, undead, evil.

803
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:07,461
Look, the important
thing is that we

804
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:08,854
get somewhere safe, all right?

805
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:09,985
I can't find my cellphone.

806
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:11,291
Let me use yours.

807
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,119
I don't have one.

808
00:54:13,162 --> 00:54:14,686
JJ SAWYER: Well, I
know you've got one.

809
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:17,428
JESSE: No, no, that privilege
was recently suspended

810
00:54:17,471 --> 00:54:19,560
for unspecified reasons.

811
00:54:19,604 --> 00:54:20,822
Oh, you think
maybe your behavior

812
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:21,736
had something to with it?

813
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,911
All right, all right.

814
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:24,609
Hey, forget about
the cell phone.

815
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:25,958
Well, what about this?

816
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:26,915
Breaker, breaker, 10-4.

817
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:27,829
Give me that.

818
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:28,743
Give me that.

819
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,575
Breaker, breaker, we got
an emergency situation.

820
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,055
Anybody out there?
Come back.

821
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:37,186
[radio crackling]

822
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,100
Anybody out there?

823
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,059
[radio crackling]

824
00:54:40,102 --> 00:54:41,756
We're in the middle of nowhere.

825
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,627
[laughs]

826
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,282
You shut up.

827
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,326
You got all the lingo.

828
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,067
You got all the moves, you know.

829
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,156
You can have my job
now that it's open.

830
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,157
Oh, forget it.

831
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,463
Who wants to drive a truck?

832
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:54,291
JJ SAWYER: Oh, you
got something better?

833
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,292
Anything.

834
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:56,205
All right, go ahead.

835
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:57,076
Name it.

836
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,949
Oh, makeup.

837
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,299
Makeup?

838
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:04,866
You mean like selling lipstick?

839
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:07,129
No, no, not what
they sell at the malls.

840
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:09,654
You know, like... like
your fashion shows

841
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:11,438
and shoots and stuff like that.

842
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:12,396
JJ SAWYER: Yeah, that's good.

843
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:13,353
I hear they make good money.

844
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:14,354
Yeah, they do.

845
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,008
It's a serious profession.

846
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:17,792
You know, there's lots of
schools for it and stuff.

847
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:19,577
Yeah, that's good.

848
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,187
That's good.

849
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,970
Whatever.

850
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:42,121
You handled that
well back there.

851
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:42,991
She likes you.

852
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,954
Well, no accounting
for good taste.

853
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:51,652
Look, I just learned more
about my own kid in this truck

854
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,654
than I have in the past year.

855
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:58,006
You know, I caught her
up there in the sleeper.

856
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:02,271
She's got a lot of questions
about her dad, but I was...

857
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,143
I was good.

858
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:05,840
I... you know...

859
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:10,671
I made it sound like Cutter
and I were good friends, and...

860
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:14,240
Yeah, I didn't talk to
her about Cutter much.

861
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:15,328
It was just too hard.

862
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:21,334
What about you?

863
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,772
What about me?

864
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:28,341
Do you have any questions?

865
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,908
Questions about what?

866
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,649
Well, maybe why I went
with him and not you.

867
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:38,090
Because you loved
him more, right?

868
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:41,746
No, are you kidding?

869
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:44,531
Cutter was a mean guy.

870
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:45,706
All he cared about was himself.

871
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:52,539
I've had a long time
to think about this.

872
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:54,367
You were a good guy.

873
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:58,023
Cocky, but you were
better than most of them.

874
00:56:58,066 --> 00:56:59,894
I just couldn't handle it.

875
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:04,333
Pretty lame, I know.

876
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:11,428
So what did Cliff say to you?

877
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:19,000
He said that you and
Jesse kept him going.

878
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:22,395
[beeping sound]

879
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,876
Why are we slowing down?

880
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,972
Believe me, kid.

881
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,409
It's not by choice.

882
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,410
What do you think it is?

883
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,763
I don't know,
but it's not good.

884
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:53,513
Now what?

885
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,907
Now, I go check underneath.

886
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,212
Well, I'm getting out.

887
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:58,518
No.

888
00:57:58,562 --> 00:57:59,345
No, you're not.

889
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:03,349
JESSE: Oh, like
sitting here's really

890
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:05,177
going to stop a majorly
pissed off ghost from getting

891
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,526
its eternal revenge.

892
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,919
Don't you guys watch movies?

893
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:09,529
I got a life.

894
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:12,227
You mean a truck, and some
really smelly socks and a...

895
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:14,186
Cool it, Jess.

896
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:16,493
Look, you can get out but
stay close to the truck.

897
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,190
Yeah, keep your eyes peeled.

898
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:20,497
That's all I'm saying.

899
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,848
[ominous music]

900
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:53,225
Well?

901
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:54,792
I don't see anything.

902
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:55,836
Transmission?

903
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,230
Yeah, I'm afraid it might be.

904
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:00,188
Figure it's toast?

905
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:03,235
This baby's not
going anywhere.

906
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:05,411
Well, how about we just take
a nice walk through the middle

907
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:06,238
of nowhere, huh?

908
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:10,416
Hello?

909
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,548
You've got a race
car in the back.

910
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,043
You were never like her
when you were her age.

911
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:32,307
No, she gets the
attitude from her dad.

912
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:34,614

place a car can't go.

1100
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:22,599
Jesse, that car
drove out of the lake.

1101
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,209
JJ SAWYER: Hey,
she's got a point.

1102
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:26,385
I mean, that car may be
haunted, but it's still a car.

1103
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:29,127
Dude, that car is alive.

1104
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,650
JJ SAWYER: Yeah.

1105
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:32,435
So that means there's gotta
be some way to kill it.

1106
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:33,697
Whoo-wee!

1107
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,525
Look at that!

1108
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:38,876
Don't get to meet a race
car stopping around here.

1109
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:39,746
Whoo!

1110
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:40,573
It's nice.

1111
01:12:47,058 --> 01:12:49,713
You folks in an
accident or something?

1112
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:52,890
Yeah, you could say that.

1113
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:56,197
Is that yours over there?

1114
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:57,460
Yeah.

1115
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,592
Mind if I borrow the keys?

1116
01:12:59,636 --> 01:13:00,463
What?

1117
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,943
Now.

1118
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:05,729
Or you're going to be sorry
than you could possibly imagine.

1119
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:07,078
Look, mister.

1120
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:09,036
I think you folks
might need some help.

1121
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,299
Give me the keys.

1122
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:14,651
Don't bother calling the Sheriff
because he's already dead.

1123
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:16,435
You're going to get these
back, I promise you.

1124
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:17,784
I'll go get a truck...

1125
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,177
JJ...

1126
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,309
...and I want you to
drive as far as you can,

1127
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:23,442
and then drive some more.

1128
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,965
JJ, how

1129
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:25,879
It doesn't matter.

1130
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:29,187
Just be safe, OK?

1131
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,623

1132
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,146
Hey, hey hey, hey.

1133
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,583
It's OK.

1134
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:34,497
It's OK.

1135
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:40,677
You're tougher than all of us.

1136
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,287
No.

1137
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:45,769
Look, Jess, you know, I
wasn't there for you growing up.

1138
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:47,248
But I can do this.

1139
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:51,731
You just have to let me, OK?

1140
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:52,863
Now go.

1141
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:53,690
Come on.

1142
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:58,564
Sorry I tagged your truck.

1143
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:00,348
Next time I'm
pressing charges.

1144
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:01,915

Get in!

1145

1146
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:04,091
Hey!

1147
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:06,354
Not so fast, mister!

1148
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:07,486
OK?

1149
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,662
Now don't try anything funny.

1150
01:14:09,706 --> 01:14:10,663
JJ SAWYER: Wouldn't think of it.

1151
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,364
You said you shot the Sheriff?

1152
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:17,583
No.

1153
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:19,280
And I didn't shoot
the deputy either.

1154
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,107
I said nothing funny!

1155
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,331
So why are you so bloody, huh?

1156
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:28,246
What happened to the Sheriff?

1157
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:30,422
I said, what happen
to the Sheriff?

1158
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,684
All right, OK.

1162
01:14:39,997 --> 01:14:41,738
JJ, it's too late!
- Great.

1163
01:14:41,781 --> 01:14:43,130
Son of a bitch!

1164
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:45,524
Hey, run!

1165
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:46,482
Get out!

1166
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:47,439
What?

1167
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,571
Get going!
Get going!

1168
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:49,528
You heard me!

1169
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:51,835

You all right?

1178
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:43,974
I'm OK.

1179

No, no.

It's impossible!

1184
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:57,596
Go on.

1185
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,293

How can we do it, huh?

1191
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:46,471
How could we just
leave him like that?

1192
01:16:46,514 --> 01:16:49,213
Baby, JJ's got a plan.

1193
01:16:49,256 --> 01:16:50,649
You mean the plan
that you did somewhere

1194

out there on the road?

01:16:52,259 --> 01:16:54,914
Hey, don't give
up on him yet, OK?

01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:58,048
Like you did?

1197
01:16:58,091 --> 01:16:59,963
Yeah, like I did.

1198
