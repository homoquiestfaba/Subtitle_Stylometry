1
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,522
When I was a little girl.
My family and I used to travel a lot.

2
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,255
Well. My parents did. Anyway.

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,789
I would only really travel
as far as Montana - the Big Sky Country.

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,930
Home of Evel Knievel.
Custer's Last Stand. And Aunt Edna.

5
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,204
Every summer my parents would
pack me up and take me to her house.

6
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:47,372
while they would go off
on one of their grand adventures.

7
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,472
It's not that I didn't like Aunt Edna.

8
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,577
It's just that all we ever did was make jam.
And then. when we were done...

9
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,953
we would make more jam.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,994
It was during those long summer days
that I learned to love art.

11
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,227
I'd sit on the porch with my crayons
and create a new world.

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,861
One that helped me deal
with my isolation and loneliness.

13
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,599
When I was coloring. I was free.

14
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,164
Free to be anywhere I wanted.

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,540
Free from jam.

16
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,911
I drew the things around me
and saw the world with new eyes.

17
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,782
But I really longed
for someone to play with. To talk to.

18
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,378
I needed a friend.

19
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,152
And then one day it happened.

20
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,194
That was the day...

21
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,592
I met Sy.

22
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,927
( "Ready to Rain" by Leslie Mills)

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,649
 I'm so good at flying away

24
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,549
 Maybe I'm lucky

25
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,645
 Playing my cards at 21

26
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,486
 Breaking my heart

27
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,652
 Oh well. I fell. what do you know?

28
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,595
 Covered in laughter

29
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,724
 Touch me again. And then again

30
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,462
 Only for a while

31
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,505
 Till you get so high
and you've had enough

32
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,508
 And you make me swear
I won't give up

33
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:28,479
 Sunshine's ready to rain

34
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,608
 Like an ocean view when it isn't fair

35
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,518
 Like a Super 8 out of nowhere

36
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:40,719
 Sunshine's ready to rain

37
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,665
 Oh man. what then?
Where do you go

38
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,669
 When you stop wanting

39
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,672
 Everything to fit perfectly

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,607
 Just as you planned?

41
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,839
 Stand back. Feel that bump in the road

42
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,643
 Were you expecting

43
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,684
 Time to remember you're asleep?

44
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,549
 Only for a while

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,612
 Till you get so high
and you've had enough

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,592
 And you make me swear
I won't give up

47
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,358
 Sunshine's ready to rain

48
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,058
Hey!

49
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,533
You can't move.

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,962
Sy!

51
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,439
- I can't resist any longer.
- What are you up to?

52
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,306
I've been working on my own art piece.

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,738
Ahh!

54
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,647
Hey, hey! You can't touch it.
This is a work of art, OK?

55
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,982
- This is your nose, your beautiful eyes...
- (door opens)

56
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,612
(both) Jess is home.

57
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,916
Abby?

58
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,460
Abby, are you here?

59
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,926
I need your help.

60
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,662
- This is ridiculous.
- I know, but she can't see you in here.

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,067
(groans)

62
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,935
- OK, just be quiet.
- Sorry. What about under the table?

63
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,538
Have you seen my nametag?

64
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,448
- Ryan told me I can't come back till I find it.
- You've lost it again?

65
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:17,217
I don't know what I ever saw
in that sniveling, slimy, no-good weasel.

66
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,316
- I believe it was his eyes.
- Hey, what are you working on?

67
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,918
- Nothing.
- Oh, yeah, right, like I believe that.

68
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,521
- Jessica.
- Come on, Abby, let me see it.

69
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,463
OK.

70
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,094
Oh.

71
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,194
- Sy?
- Mm-hm.

72
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,740
He's hot.
No wonder I never get to meet him.

73
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,468
OK, that's enough.

74
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,034
I'm telling you, it is time
you start showing your work in galleries.

75
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,174
- I don't know. I'm just not ready yet.
- Sometimes you just gotta take a chance.

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,016
You know what? Sounds like a great idea,
but I am late for school. Bye.

77
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,147
- What about my nametag?
- Use mine.

78
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,057
I tried that last week.

79
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,595
( "Satisfied" by Bus Stop)

80
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,461
Oh, yeah!

81
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,270
Few more days,
this baby's gonna be ready to roll.

82
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,039
- Congratulations, Cal. That's quite a feat.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,842
Now, how do you plan
on getting it out of here?

84
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,940
Through the door?

85
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,611
Good luck with that.

86
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,232
Oh, yeah, that's not gonna fit.

87
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,699
(man) Surrealism
can be expressed as a depiction

88
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,466
of the irrational state
of our subconscious.

89
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:47,074
What did Neiman say on page 52
of your reading about surrealists?

90
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,041
Come on. Anybody?

91
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,587
Please tell me
somebody read the assignment.

92
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,482
Miss Morrison?

93
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,621
Well, he said that surrealists
believe the dream state...

94
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,324
It could be just as relevant
as our waking lives.

95
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,889
Mm.

96
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,197
Yes.

97
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:15,605
They also construe that the universe
is only as real as it seems,

98
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:20,942
and sometimes things that feel
the most real are the least substantive.

99
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,345
Like these papers?

100
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,946
No, Mr. Andrews,

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,681
you weren't dreaming.

102
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,589
That is a real D.

103
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,683
(bell)

104
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,026
Please, please, do your reading.

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,198
Professor,
I think you made a mistake on my paper.

106
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,930
No, Mr. Andrews,

107
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:49,634
the mistake was when you took this class
thinking you had an easy Humanity credit.

108
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,610
I understand, but I really need this credit.

109
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,476
You should've thought about that
six weeks ago.

110
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,880
The D stands.

111
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,121
Well, not your finest hour.

112
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,628
I just don't get
this stupid pseudosurrealist crap.

113
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,129
It's not crap.

114
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,689
- What'd you say?
- I said it's not crap.

115
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,201
And how do you know?

116
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,465
Oh, A-plus.

117
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,372
Sorry.
I didn't know I was speaking to an expert.

118
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,309
Well, now you know.

119
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,447
You really need to work
on your people skills.

120
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,177
Ow.

121
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,981
This is the third time today, man.

122
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,889
Nick?

123
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,054
Nick?

124
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,030
Do you understand
the meaning of "level"?

125
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,566
No, that's OK.
Why don't you come down and follow me?

126
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,966
I've got a job less complicated for you.

127
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,597
You have a wedgie, by the way.

128
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,632
I hate that guy.

129
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,977
- Here you go. Have a nice day.
- See you later.

130
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,120
Jessica's late again.

131
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,349
You told her not to come back
without her nametag.

132
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:16,293
- I did. Four hours ago.
- She's probably still looking for it, Ryan.

133
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,354
I like you, Abby. I do.

134
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:24,665
That's why I'm telling you this. I know
you depend on Jessica for part of the rent.

135
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,605
What are you saying? You're not gonna
fire her because she lost her nametag?

136
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,006
Look, nametags are company policy.

137
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:37,641
Besides, a patron is 76% more likely to talk
to someone with a nametag than without.

138
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,813
Look, you wanna save her job.
I understand that. Stay till she gets here.

139
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,254
- Why?
- We're short.

140
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,884
- Ryan, there's no one in the store.
- That's beside the point.

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,420
No. She works books. I mean, I work
coffee. It doesn't even make any sense.

142
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,558
- Are you arguing with me?
- No, I'm not. I'm just...

143
00:08:55,635 --> 00:09:00,334
Ryan, look, tonight's my anniversary, and
I'm making dinner for my boyfriend, so...

144
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,136
I want you to go home.
I do.

145
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,771
But if your friend thinks she can come in
when she wants, someone has to cover...

146
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,372
- Are we clear?
- As mud.

147
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,909
Good.
I think all these should be straight. OK.

148
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,994
Excuse me.
Welcome to Borders... Oh.

149
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,970
You don't happen to carry
The Idiot's Guide to Art Appreciation?

150
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,030
I was told it has lots of pictures.

151
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,736
- It's in the juvenile section.
- That's good. It's even sort of funny.

152
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,008
So, do you wanna order
or did you just come here to annoy me?

153
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,844
Wow. OK. Uh...

154
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,975
Let me get...

155
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,113
the chocolate cheesecake.

156
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,179
OK.
Would you like a coffee with that?

157
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,658
To be perfectly honest,
I feel like you might spit in it.

158
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,753
- That's clever.
- You don't like me much, do you?

159
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,321
Hm.
It's funny, I thought you were slow.

160
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,963
"Abigail."
That's a weird name.

161
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,368
It's Abby.

162
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,703
So, have a nice day.

163
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,679
- Cheesecake?
- Yeah, right.

164
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,313
(whispers) Where have you been?

165
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,513
Your glasses.

166
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,126
OK, here you go.

167
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,260
Oh!

168
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,327
Oh, my God!

169
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,103
Oh! Look, um...

170
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:47,077
One of these. These will work for you.
They're on the house.

171
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,172
No, it's... it's all on me.

172
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,046
Oh, gosh.

00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,286
 What is this I feel?

175
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,491
 What used to be a dream
is now becoming real

176
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,262
 Only yesterday it had no appeal

177
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,828
 But I guess things change

178
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,606
 Suddenly

179
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,578
 The sky's a bluer blue

180
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,615
 And full of possibilities

181
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,344
 Suddenly

182
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:31,357
 It's looking like it's gonna be OK

183
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,860
 On a day like today

184
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:39,387
 I could take a chance on someone new

185
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,866
 On a day like today

186
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:47,269
 I could fall in love with you

187
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,364
 On a day

188
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,605
 On a day like today

189
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,337
(phone rings)

190
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,940
Oh, no! OK.

191
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,948
Coming.

192
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,546
- Hello?
- I've got a crisis.

193
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,091
I don't like it
when you start off like that.

194
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,889
You know my cousin,
the one who just transferred here?

195
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:14,399
- Well, I don't "know him" know him.
- You're going to. He's coming tonight.

196
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,196
What? No, Jess, uh-uh...

197
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,328
Hey, I was wondering
where I could find a book on embroidery?

198
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,272
- Shh!
- What? Don't you work here?

199
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,071
Do I look like I work here?

200
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,248
He's not that bad, I promise.
It's just I wasn't expecting to see him

201
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,409
and I really didn't know what to say.

202
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,749
He mentioned
that we should get together,

203
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,018
and I sort of said, "Sure," you know,
because that's what you say,

204
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,286
and he's, like, "OK. Dinner tonight?"

205
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,488
And I'm, like...
You know how I am with the "no" word.

206
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,159
No! Jessica, no! It's my anniversary.
I'm making dinner for Sy. I'm sorry.

207
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,362
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,235
I don't have his new number.

209
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:58,436
Well, maybe I could, like,
walk around campus until I find him.

210
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,140
No. You know what?
It's fine, actually. Don't worry about it.

211
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,911
- He can come over?
- Yeah. He can come over.

212
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,978
- Bye. Thanks. Abby.
- OK. Bye.

213
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:14,984
Hi, Ryan.

214
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,000
Happy anniversary.

215
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,230
They're beautiful.

216
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,704
Oh.

217
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,474
- They're for you.
- Oh!

218
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,978
Thanks.

219
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:40,675
- They smell so good. Thank you.
- You haven't made dinner for me?

220
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,153
You know, you didn't need to do that.

221
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,952
Yeah. Um...

222
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,459
I didn't. I was going to,

223
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,464
but Jess called and said that she's gonna
bring her cousin over for dinner.

224
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,625
What, here?

225
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,129
- On our anniversary?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,876
I know. I'm sorry.

227
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,978
Well, I mean... No, no, that's fine.

228
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,072
I mean, no, actually, it's good.

229
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,276
It's... You don't mind?

230
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,787
Come on.
How could I be mad with you?

231
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,848
I can't. We'II... You know what?
We'll go and do something fun afterwards.

232
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,393
Yeah.
Yeah, we could go see a movie.

233
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,452
We'll see one of those romantic movies.

234
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,693
- You like gushy movies.
- I love it.

235
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,497
I know you do. Thank you.

236
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,840
Oh, it's somewhere.

237
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,440
Abby?

238
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,008
Jess? Jess, it's open.

239
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,715
I need... your...

240
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,381
help!

241
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,256
You know the only difference
between Ryan and the Pope?

242
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,358
The Pope only expects you
to kiss his ring.

243
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,426
OK, tell me what happened.

244
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,039
- I got fired.
- No, you didn't!

245
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,669
No! No.
He said that if I stayed he wouldn't fire you.

246
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,043
I don't know why you dated him
in the first place.

247
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:19,050
You know,
sometimes I wish I had a boyfriend like Sy.

248
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,746
Yeah.
He would never fire you.

249
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,751
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I really needed that job.

250
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,453
Why don't you just get another one?

251
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,957
It's easier said than done.

252
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,060
Here.
You need them more than I do.

253
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,231
Oh.
Where did they come from?

254
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,468
- From Sy.
- Sy. Oh.

255
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:48,502
No, it's not like that. He's just not very good
at color selection, so I help him out a bit.

256
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,108
I don't think any guy I've dated
has ever given me flowers.

257
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,743
Ever.

258
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,223
Well, except Ryan the Superslut when
he cheated on me with that lunch lady.

259
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,283
Hey, didn't Ryan the Narcissist
send you flowers once?

260
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,797
Yeah. Only so he could hear himself
compliment himself for a week.

261
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:10,892
Besides, that's when I was still dating "I'm
still in the closet" Ryan, so it doesn't count.

262
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,964
I just don't understand. There are so many
guys. Why only date guys named Ryan?

263
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,343
It's my curse.

264
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,175
(rock music blaring)

265
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,883
Abby, could you get that?

266
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,477
I'm coming.
Turn it down.

267
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,089
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

268
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,489
Come on in. I'm Abby.
Nice to meet you.

269
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,994
- She's just running a few minutes late.
- Oh, OK.

270
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

271
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,965
- Who's this?
- This isn't your cousin.

272
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,197
- He's not my cousin.
- (knock)

273
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,363
Excuse me.

274
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,532
Hey. I...

275
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,479
Megan doesn't live here, does she?

276
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,811
Next door.
Apartment 14.

277
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,783
- Right.
- Nice to meet you.

278
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,319
You too.

279
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,412
- Hey, brother.
- All yours.

280
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,286
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, coz.

281
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,326
- Abigail, right?
- Abby.

282
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,624
- You know each other?
- We've met before.

283
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:15,690
- Really? When?
- We're in the same art depreciation class.

284
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,895
- And at the bookstore...
- Don't go there.

285
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,495
Go where?
Am I missing something?

286
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,039
- No.
- Yes.

287
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,871
- (Abby) Kill me now.
- Well, come in.

288
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,934
Have a seat.

289
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,981
- So, what's with the pajamas?
- Bad day.

290
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,246
OK, pajamas it is.

291
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,152
- I got fired.
- You what?

292
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,714
This egomaniac I work for
has had it out for me since I dumped him.

293
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,421
Let me take a guess. Uh...

294
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,191
- Ryan?
- You know him?

295
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,995
Let's just call it a hunch.

296
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,261
(music on car radio)

297
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,167
 Gobble. Gobble. Gobble. Gobble

298
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,103
 It's the turkey for "excuse me"

299
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,540
(squeaks)

300
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,805
Oh, shoot.

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,941
- She's not gonna want to come, George.
- Well, it's worth asking.

302
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,546
Honey, why don't you bring something with
you, like... why don't you bring that turkey?

303
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,888
You're right. Who could resist this turkey?
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

304
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,691
Yoo-hoo! Abigail!

305
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,027
- Hey, Mrs. Morrison.
- Oh, hi, Jessica.

306
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,068
Mom, Dad, I wasn't expecting you.
Did you want something?

307
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,332
Well, we're just fine.
Aren't we, George?

308
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,464
Oh.
Who's this nice young man?

309
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,531
- My cousin, Quinn.
- Nice to meet you.

310
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,544
- How do you do, Quentin?
- Mom, I asked you what you wanted.

311
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,673
- We're going to the cemetery.
- Gonna decorate for Thanksgiving.

312
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,809
You decorate a relative's grave
for the holidays?

313
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,911
- No, we decorate our own graves.
- Mom!

314
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:47,357
You see, George bought our plots
as a 20th anniversary present,

315
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,758
and I thought
the poor things looked empty.

316
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,729
So for our 25th,
Mary Louise bought a headstone.

317
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,859
It's got Morrison in big letters, George
on one side, Mary Louise on the other.

318
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,836
- So we'll always be together.
- Oh, sweetie.

319
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,772
- So, please, come with us this time.
- No.

320
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,399
Yes. Please. You never come.

321
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:09,436
Mom, I don't wanna go decorate
my parents' graves with my parents.

322
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:14,680
- It's a cemetery. Don't people complain?
- Honey, they can't. They're dead.

323
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,153
Oh, show her the turkey.
We got a little turkey.

324
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,783
- Turkey, turkey. Turkey, turkey.
- Oh, gobble, gobble.

325
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,351
Maybe Quentin and Jessica
could come along.

326
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,954
Thank you,
but I'm not much of a decorator.

327
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,899
Oh, Abigail says that,
and she's quite the artist.

328
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,496
Mom, nobody's interested. You'll just
have to go be morbid by yourself. Sorry.

329
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,871
You'll just have to miss
a good time, then.

330
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:41,675
In that case, you must come along
with Abigail and Jessica to Thanksgiving.

331
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,375
- I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
- She won't.

332
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,815
- If it's no trouble.
- I wouldn't ask if it were.

333
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:51,254
Mother, can I speak to you for a second?
Look, I'm sure he's already got plans.

334
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,121
He wouldn't say yes
if he already had plans.

335
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,922
Do you?

336
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,758
- There. That's settled.
- I don't want him to come.

337
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,856
- (whispers) I don't want him to come.
- If I could interject?

338
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:06,837
- Oh, what nice manners.
- Maybe it's best if I pass on the invitation.

339
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,499
Well, she didn't invite you, dear.
I did.

340
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,373
We're off.
We'll see you all for Thanksgiving.

341
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,743
- Bye-bye.
- Dad, help me. Please, Dad. Dad! Dad!

342
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,214
Nice meeting you.

343
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,244
(crashing from kitchen)

344
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,586
- (Jess) Oh! Five-second rule.
- (more crashing)

345
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,821
OK, uh, got everything.
I'm almost ready.

346
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,989
What are you making?
Mac and cheese?

347
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,161
Are you kidding?
Boil, drain, add milk and butter, then stir?

348
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,635
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

349
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,037
That's, like, five steps.
I made ramen. That's only three.

350
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,099
Tear it open, dump it in, throw it away.

351
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,873
- So, how are your classes?
- They're all right.

352
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,143
If I don't pass art, I can pretty much
say goodbye to law school.

353
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,582
Abby could teach you.
She's a great teacher.

354
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,621
- No, she's not.
- But you wanna be.

355
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,020
And what better way to get experience?

356
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,150
He is not teachable.

357
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,888
- I'm a great student.
- That's doubtful.

358
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,328
Look, I'll make you a deal.

359
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,390
Help me pass art class,
and I won't ruin your Thanksgiving.

360
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,960
Yeah, no. You see, spending four hours
with you and my parents

361
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,303
is much easier than spending
an entire semester tutoring you.

362
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,865
OK.

363
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,472
What if I get Jess her job back,

364
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,506
and... I don't come
to your Thanksgiving dinner?

365
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,576
- We do need the rent money.
- Final offer.

366
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,851
No!
And that is my final answer.

367
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:37,759
OK. You know what? You're right. You
have bailed me out one too many times.

368
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,297
Thank you.

369
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:46,634
So I'll just go upstairs and pack. Don't
worry, I'll be out of your hair by morning.

370
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,002
Jess.

371
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,634
It's fine. I've always wanted to know
what it'd be like to live in a box.

372
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,578
OK, OK.
Jess, it's fine, I got it.

373
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,138
OK, listen.
You get Jess her job back

374
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:04,018
and you don't come with me
for Thanksgiving and... you've got a deal.

375
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,491
(Abby) Who in the world has parents
that decorate their own grave?

376
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,029
I mean, I must've been adopted.
Oh, gosh!

377
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,555
Oh, and I got conned into
helping this boy out with his homework.

378
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,467
- He's a decent chap, isn't he?
- I don't know.

379
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,869
- Do you like him?
- If you like a migraine.

380
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,272
Come on. If he needs help,
maybe you should just give him a hand.

381
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,368
No. I think he's obnoxious.

382
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,972
Don't you think as a teacher
you'll deal with obnoxious students?

383
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,984
No, I don't think as a teacher
I'll deal with obnoxious students!

384
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,781
No!

385
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,119
Come here!
I'm gonna show you who's obnoxious!

386
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,422
- (Quinn) How long do we look at this?
- Huh?

387
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,261
Well, you seem to know
the routine around here.

388
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,734
What's the standard time of staring
without looking pretentious?

389
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:56,001
Yeah, well,
it's not about a set period of time.

390
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:00,204
You just have to appreciate
what the artist is trying to say.

391
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:10,211
- It looks like spaghetti.
- OK, well, to you it might.

392
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,416
You know,
I happen to see something else.

393
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,692
Fettuccine.

394
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,253
Do you dismiss everything
you don't understand?

395
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,630
I haven't dismissed you yet, have I?

396
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:28,037
Look, all I'm saying is my sister could paint
something more realistic, and she's ten.

397
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,099
- It's not realism, it's how it makes you feel.
- And it makes me feel hungry.

398
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:37,240
OK, well, if you want a good grade,
you're gonna look past the spaghetti.

399
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,078
Oh, wow.

400
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,779
- Did you feel that?
- Huh?

401
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,518
We just had our first moment.

402
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:49,219
- You're an idiot.
- But you felt... Nothing, huh? A little bit?

403
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,064
So your parents are cool.

404
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,565
- To you, maybe.
- What does that mean?

405
00:23:55,634 --> 00:24:00,264
- It means you didn't grow up with them.
- So what's the deal?

406
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't know you well enough
to tell you my life history.

407
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,133
Come on.

408
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,337
They weren't around a lot.

409
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,349
End of story.

410
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:17,947
- Do you wanna hear my life story?
- Hm. I don't, actually.

411
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:22,084
Come on.
It involves fire, juggling and a midget.

412
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,554
So, you up for something to eat?

413
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,296
I think I'll pass, but thank you.

414
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,836
What?
Do you have a better offer?

415
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,565
Maybe.

416
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,573
(chuckles)

417
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,074
What?

418
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,579
I was thinking,
with your quirky personality,

419
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,705
you must not go out too often.

420
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:48,810
I get plenty of dates. In fact, that's where
I'm headed as soon as I finish helping you.

421
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,720
- Really?
- Yeah. Don't act so shocked.

422
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,054
What's his name?

423
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,617
His name is...
It's none of your business.

424
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:03,157
- That's what I thought.
- His name is Sy, which is short for Simon.

425
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,033
Are you always this annoying?

426
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,402
I like to call it being honest.

427
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:13,911
Well, Mr. Andrews, there is such a thing
as being a bit too honest.

428
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,579
(beep)

429
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,452
Hey. Quinn. It's Nicki. I thought we could
study together for law tonight. And then...

430
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,482
Hey. It's Cal. You know. If you press
this button you could leave a memo.

431
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,257
Check one. Mic check.
Sibilance. Sibilance.

432
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,527
Hey. Quinn. It's Lisa.
I thought we could go dancing.

433
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,330
- (Nicki) Are you calling Quinn?
- (Lisa) Excuse me!

434
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,736
- (Nicki) Ow. My hair!
- (Lisa) I got nothin' for you. Girl!

435
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,337
Hey, buddy.

436
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,709
How's it goin'?

437
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,618
Aaaargh!

438
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,179
Oh! Hey-hey, man! What's goin' on?
When did you get back?

439
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,986
- Just now.
- How was your day?

440
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,152
It was good. I met a girl.

441
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,696
Oh. Be careful, bro.
That's a four-letter word.

442
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,289
No, she's... she's different.

443
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,737
Actually, I think
the proper term today is "challenged."

444
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,672
No, Cal. She's...

445
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,403
I don't know... Better.

446
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,605
- Better? Better than the cheerleader?
- Yeah. Too bubbly.

447
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,241
- What about the librarian?
- Boring.

448
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,411
- That cute little red-headed chick?
- No eyebrows.

449
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:32,718
Yeah, well, they're all different, man.
That's why they just call 'em women.

450
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,056
Quick question.
When are you gonna get a new game?

451
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,565
They make new games?

452
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:47,330
Language section.
Financial book you have in your hand.

453
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:52,638
- Financial section's over there.
- (Quinn) Look what they did. See this?

454
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:57,478
They're working on the 19 and one quarter.
I haven't seen anything like this since '84.

455
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,881
Eastern and ski resorts on the same shelf.

456
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,114
You be good. OK.

457
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,679
They obviously didn't get the memo.

458
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,658
Can I help you guys?

459
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,992
- Get us the manager, son.
- I'm the manager.

460
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,429
You're Mr...

461
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,091
Sounders?

462
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,263
- I'm Mr. Sanders.
- That's what I said.

463
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,397
- And you are?
- Schlosky.

464
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,443
Jack Schlosky.
Director of Corporate Infrastructure.

465
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,274
- You didn't get the L10 memo, did you?
- L10?

466
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,541
- There goes the Q4 profits.
- Q4 profits?

467
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,243
Who said anything
about the Q4 profits?

468
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,616
- He...
- We just drove in from Corporate.

469
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:41,125
- Oh, from Michigan?
- Yes, from Michigan. 18-hour drive.

470
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,218
- Without a bathroom stop.
- Without a bathroom stop.

471
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,128
That illustrates
the seriousness of the situation.

472
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,758
Do we have a problem?

473
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,437
Problem is,
your store's in the old format.

474
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,408
- This is last year's format here, son.
- I... I didn't know we had a format.

475
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,468
Consumers have an easier time
locating books

476
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,777
if you move everything from there to there,
and there to there.

477
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,443
- It's all in this packet.
- You can't be serious.

478
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,181
Oh, we can.
We've been serious, we're serious now.

479
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,749
Bottom line is, if you don't move these
sections, we move you. Get the point, eh?

480
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:19,729
- Are you sure you're from Corporate?
- He transferred from the Canadian offices.

481
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:24,861
Yeah. They're just like
the American offices, just with... hockey.

482
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,961
The whole store?

483
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,270
Do you wanna lose franchising rights?
'Cause I have the power to shut this place.

484
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,810
- He does. He's got the power.
- I do. The power.

485
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,438
- What power?
- Of Grayskull.

486
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,505
Hey, it's just I'm short-staffed now.

487
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,710
- Why is that?
- I had to let somebody go.

488
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,309
- Who?
- Jessica Lindstrom.

489
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,515
- Why?
- She had less-than-desirable work habits.

490
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,559
- Lindstrom, Jessica. Look that up.
- Lindstrom. L-y...

491
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,719
- L-i...
- N... There's...

492
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:55,061
- Then it's D, right? D...
- Arghh! Too many letters. No! Sh, sh, sh!

493
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,328
- You guys dated.
- How did you know that?

494
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,498
- It's in your personal records.
- We know ev-ery-thing.

495
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,667
- Everything?
- Ev-ery-thing.

496
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,008
- Everything.
- You fired someone you dated?

497
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,413
You crazy, man? You wanna open yourself
up to a multi-million-dollar lawsuit?

498
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:16,147
- No. Jeez, no.
- Then I suggest you hire her back.

499
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:20,419
- Immediately! Without question!
- With a raise! No questioning!

500
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,858
- Now get your store in order.
- I will, I will.

501
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,727
You know what? You got one week. One
week, then we come back with auditors.

502
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,293
- The auditors are coming?
- Prime directive from Corporate, C3... PO.

503
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,503
Can I get your business card?

504
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,769
- Um...
- Uh...

505
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:45,581
Why? So you can call me, looking for
answers to questions you should know?

506
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,414
- I don't think so, son.
- I understand, I understand.

507
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,545
- Go.
- OK.

508
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,716
- I told you we needed business cards.
- I know.

509
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,093
( "In Your Arms" by Amelia's Dream)

510
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,192
 Hey. Baby

511
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,103
 Where are you?

512
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:13,304
 I'm running to love you all over

513
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,346
 Closer

514
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,937
 Kiss me

515
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,542
(Abby) If Monet is regarded
as the Impressionist par excellence,

516
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:24,850
one must admit
that both Degas and Renoir are also...

517
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,957
If you don't pay attention,
it's not gonna work.

518
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,430
I just don't get it.
It's so boring.

519
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,430
I need a break.
Where's your bathroom?

520
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,166
It's down the hallway.

521
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,115
(Quinn) These are really good.

522
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,216
- This isn't the bathroom.
- What's this?

523
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,057
It's not done.

524
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,326
I know a place you could show these.
I bet you could make money.

525
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,630
You know what?
It's really not about money for me, so...

526
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,503
- Then why do it?
- If I have to tell you, it's not worth it. Go!

527
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:20,306
There are always two people in art -
the observer and the observed.

528
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,778
Remember, art is subjective.

529
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:28,479
Each person gains new insights as they
allow themselves to be immersed in art.

530
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:34,981
Let's turn to last week's assignment. What
new insights did you gain from the exhibit?

531
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,392
- Mr. Andrews?
- Well, uh...

532
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:45,334
Well, there's this one artist
named, uh, Dylan Thompson,

533
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:50,932
who said surrealism has less to do
with what is random and senseless

534
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:56,538
and more to do with accepting that
our lives don't always have to make sense.

535
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,445
Go on.

536
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,484
Well,

537
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:05,545
I remember looking at one of his paintings,
and for someone willing to take the time,

538
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,888
they could really find something deeper
to connect with.

539
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,331
- (teacher) That's valid.
- Kind of like those who judge people

540
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,233
before they get to know
what's really inside.

541
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:25,232
Good observation.
Now, let's turn to page, um... 621.

542
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,076
- You see what you've created?
- Oh, I didn't do anything.

543
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,479
You taught, I learned.

544
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,715
So, Sy's cool
with this whole tutoring thing, right?

545
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,053
Yeah, yeah.
He's pretty understanding.

546
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,183
Great. I'll see you later.

547
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,989
OK.

548
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,931
- Hey, Abby.
- Yeah?

549
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:52,333
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.

550
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,934
- (Abby) I love that movie!
- Me too. And we've only seen it 30 times.

551
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,071
- 32.
- Who's counting?

552
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,173
What guy
would ever indulge me like this?

553
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,549
That is just what I was thinking.

554
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,349
(both) Weird.

555
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,358
- (Abby) It was Goethe.
- Right. I think it was Goethe

556
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:19,157
who said that people rarely love others
for who they really are,

557
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,630
but rather
what they imagine them to be.

558
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,759
- (Abby) Right.
- So, go on, prepare for takeoff.

559
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:29,205
- (Abby) OK. One, two, three...
- Ready? One, two, three...

560
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,503
So, Sy, what do you imagine me to be?

561
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,412
- (Sy) An angel.
- Oh, really?

562
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,781
(Sy) But obviously I know
you're really a flesh-eating demon.

563
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,047
I sure am.

564
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,685
That's cold.

565
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,488
I have snow everywhere.

566
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:58,328
Anyway,
returning to the subject of imagination,

567
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,428
I believe it was Shakespeare who said,

568
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:05,807
"So full of shapes is fancy
that it alone is high fantastical."

569
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,220
(door opens)

570
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,984
- (Abby) Hey, Jess.
- Hey.

571
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,789
Wow.
You look like death warmed over.

572
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,386
Quinn's plan to help helped too much.

573
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,298
Ryan's killing us
trying to get the books reorganized.

574
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,337
Oh, by the way, Quinn called for you.

575
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,998
Really?

576
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,439
- You like him.
- No.

577
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,410
Well, I think he likes you.
You never know, he may ask you out.

578
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,242
- No, he won't.
- Why?

579
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,805
Because...

580
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,579
he thinks I have a boyfriend.

581
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,450
- You didn't tell him about Sy, did you?
- Sorta.

582
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,254
Well, which part of "sorta?"

583
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,455
Like Sy's sorta not real?

584
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,589
Like he's imaginary?

585
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,134
Sorta.

586
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,194
OK, Abby, what's up with Sy?

587
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,705
You know,
he's just there for me all the time.

588
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,141
That's great when you were five,
but what about now?

589
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,339
Quinn's real, and he likes you.

590
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,841
- He's gonna think I'm crazy.
- I didn't think you were when you told me.

591
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,943
We were five.
We didn't know any better.

592
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,353
Just tell him, OK?

593
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,257
Abby.

594
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,988
(Abby) I'll tell him.

595
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,192
OK. OK, this can work.

596
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,665
This has gotta work.

597
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,696
(Jess) Hold everything!

598
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,140
Oh, no! Oh!

599
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:51,776
I found these from the World History
section. Someone had them in Gardening.

600
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,680
No, no.

601
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,242
God, this is impossible.

602
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,355
I'm gonna kill Quinn.

603
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,984
- What?
- Nothing.

604
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:08,259
We should be halfway done by now. We're
not even through the youth section yet.

605
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,732
We'll be fine.
It's starting to pick up.

606
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,133
No, it isn't.

607
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:20,037
If we don't get this turned around,
Corporate's gonna have my job.

608
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,511
How's it feel?

609
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,448
I need you to work Thanksgiving.

610
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,747
- I can't.
- I'll pay you double.

611
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,219
Triple.

612
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,780
( "Let It Go" by Bus Stop)

613
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,783
(grunts)

614
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:44,096
- Cal, what are you doing?
- I'm fixing your car.

615
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,830
But my car's not broken.

616
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,895
Oh.

617
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,272
You know what?
You should just go to Abby's.

618
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:57,440
- Am I supposed to walk?
- Well, I mean, obviously your car's broken.

619
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,983
- Bro, it was working before...
- Shh, kitten.

620
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:06,047
Why don't you just walk away? It'll be done
by the time you get back. All righty. Great.

621
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,085
Oh, yeah!

622
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,758
Time travel is possible!

623
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,464
Here. Try some of my favorite.

624
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,271
- What is it?
- Won flung food.

625
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,972
Won flung nothing.

626
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,982
- I thought it was funny.
- It was... cute.

627
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,049
Oh, good.

628
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,546
Chinese.

629
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,320
I am starving.

630
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,884
Ohh! That smells so good.

631
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:51,865
- Ryan has me working Thanksgiving.
- What? No! Jessica, you promised.

632
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,064
I'm sorry.
He's paying me triple.

633
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,677
- What? Was that stupid?
- It's not stupid, just greedy.

634
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,041
I'm gonna take mine to go.

635
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,109
Don't study too hard.

636
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,326
- Did Jess just steal half our dinner?
- Yeah, pretty much.

637
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,054
Here. Take your fortune
before she comes back and steals that.

638
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,656
I love these.

639
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,191

"It is important to look out
for that which you cannot see."

00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,638
Huh.

642
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:39,649
- What the hell does that mean?
- I have no idea.

643
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,632
Sy? What are you doing?

644
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,329
- I know when I'm not wanted.
- Is this about last night?

645
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,871
- I just hope you're happy with him.
- With Quinn?

646
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,931
Of course with Quinn.
If he breaks your heart, I swear...

647
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,137
What are you gonna do?
Stab him with some imaginary sword?

648
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,112
- Careful.
- Sorry.

649
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,345
That man is a player.
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

650
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,014
Wait a second.
Hey, that's mine.

651
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,522
We bought this together.
You can have the telly.

652
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,684
All right, stop.
Enough. Sit down.

653
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,456
Now, listen to me.
I am not gonna leave you for him, OK?

654
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,555
- You promise?
- Mm-hm.

655
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,068
- Then prove it to me.
- Fine. Anything.

656
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,970
Well, do you have to spend so much time
spoon-feeding that baboon?

657
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,807
I mean, couldn't you just lend him one
of your art books? He can read, can't he?

Hello?
Somebody say something.

666
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,339
Hello, I'm looking for Quinn Andrews.

667
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,846
Hello?
I'm looking for a Quinn Andrews.

668
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,778
Quinn...

669
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,180
- Yo.
- Hi.

670
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,311
Hey. Good.
Thought I had the wrong door.

671
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,854
Wait, then maybe I have the wrong door.
Why does this keep happening to me?

672
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,450
- Is Quinn here?
- Yes. Yes.

673
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,361
Yes. OK.
We're both in the right place, then.

674
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,299
Good. Well, I've actually seen you before.
At the bookstore.

675
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,168
- What bookstore?
- Borders, on Fifth.

676
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,071
- What did I look like?
- You looked like you.

677
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:48,077
- Oh, except you were wearing pants.
- Oh.

678
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,238
Pants.

679
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,216
Yeah, all right.
That sounds like that coulda been me.

680
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,380
Yeah, all right, come on in.

681
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,482
You're the artist person
helping Quinn with his homework.

682
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,687
- Yeah.
- Dating that guy with the weird name.

683
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:08,061
- Sy. Right.
- That's not that weird.

684
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,624
Do you think you could just
give this to Quinn for me, please?

685
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,398
You know what? No. No.
It's really not a good idea.

686
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,168
I tend to lose things,
and then Quinn gets mad,

687
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,574
and when he gets mad he yells,
and I fear the yelling.

688
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,239
So maybe you should just
give it to him yourself. OK?

689
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,283
OK.

690
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,009
Your face is good.

691
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,180
You want some chicken salad?

692
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,451
I made it with ham.

693
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,789
- It... I...
- Hey.

694
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,592
- I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, yeah. Calvin let me in.

695
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:45,226
Great. You want something to eat or drink?
I think Cal made chicken... something.

696
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:50,569
- No. Actually, I came by to give you this.
- Oh, great, then we can study here.

697
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,535
Yeah, I was just kinda thinking
you could study by yourself.

698
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,446
Whoa, whoa.
Are you trying to bail on our deal?

699
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,040
No.

700
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,108
Good.

701
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,321
There we go.

702
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:15,656
Um, you know what? I think I'm just
gonna... go missing for a little while here.

703
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:20,966
- I hope you're not leaving because of me.
- It's totally 'cause of you. This is just weird.

704
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,804
- Oh, this awkwardness...
- Well, it was nice meeting you.

705
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,639
- Nice meeting you too, uh...
- Abby.

706
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,579
- That coulda been it.
- He's a little...

707
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,139
Different.

708
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:39,087
I believe the proper term used today
is "challenged."

709
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,650
Oh.

710
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:46,992
OK, so 202, 203... Yeah, up to 205.

711
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:52,092
And the top of 207
and I think you should be good.

712
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,761
All right.

713
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,397
Hey, uh... You hungry?

714
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,703
Uh, no. I'm fine.

715
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,135
- You're not hungry at all?
- Uh-uh. No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

716
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,580
Look me in the eye
and tell me you're not hungry.

717
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,883
You're almost there.
"Quinn, I'm a little..."

718
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,791
- I'm a little hungry.
- Great. Let's get something to eat.

719
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,388
You want me to believe
that Johann Vermeer traced his art?

720
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,989
He used a camera.

721
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,299
Vermeer is a 17th-century artist.
There weren't any cameras back then.

722
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,363
He used a camera obscura,
which was a primitive camera.

723
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,774
Basically, it would project
the image onto the canvas.

724
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:38,247
You'd be surprised how many
17th-century artists experimented with it.

725
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:44,254
Just think about it. You get hired
to paint a grand duke or a bishop.

726
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,881
You cannot take any risks.

727
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,515
OK...

728
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,561
Look at the lighting. The perspective.

729
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,120
Most of the models are left-handed.

730
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,361
- So what?
- Most people are right-handed.

731
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,870
The projections
would have mirrored the image.

732
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,439
What happened to the guy
that knew nothing about art?

733
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,170
It was a lot easier to hate him.

734
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,337
Minor in history.

735
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,074
There you go.

736
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,844
- Oh, let me...
- Please. My treat.

737
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,849
Thank you.

738
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,417
I wanna show you something.

739
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:30,064
- You wanna show me something?
- It's a surprise.

740
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,495
Uh...

741
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,197
Yeah, no thank you.
I'm not good at surprises.

742
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,137
We're gonna change that.

743
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,902
I want you to consider this
a new experience. OK?

744
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,839
Come on.

745
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,884
 What do I know about the surreal?

746
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,253
 Do I know what it's like to feel?

747
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,985
 What's in my heart
but not what's in my mind

748
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,826
A bunch of local artists
have an exhibit here about once a month.

749
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,956
Thought you might wanna check it out.

750
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:06,526
- How'd you find out about this place?
- Oh, I come for the music.

751
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:10,403
All kinds of bands come here.
Next week Braid's performing.

752
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,601
Really? I like them.

753
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,769
That's cool.

754
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,406
Why don't you check out the artwork
and I'll grab us some drinks.

755
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,279
OK.

756
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,716
Oh, excuse me.

757
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:51,914
I used to have this phobia of clowns.
Never did figure out the origin.

758
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:57,683
Stephen King's It
didn't really help my condition either.

759
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,485
- Well, I think they're beautiful.
- Thanks.

760
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,048
You're an artist?

761
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,425
I'm an art student.

762
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,427
Don't worry. It took me a while
to admit I was an artist, too.

763
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:14,164
(woman) Hey, Verna,
come here for a second.

764
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,628
Hey.

765
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,720
There you go.

766
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,362
Is everything OK?

767
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,629
I think I should go.

768
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,001
- Yeah, OK. Sure.
- OK.

769
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,607
Quinn.

770
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:01,173
- Thanks again. I'll pay you back, I promise.
- I know you will.

771
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,277
You guys have a good time.
And you have a terrific boyfriend.

772
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,415
- No, he's not...
- You have a terrific boyfriend.

773
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,394
This must be so exciting for you.

774
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,325
That girl was kinda cute.

775
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,924
Is someone jealous?

776
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,367
No.

777
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:24,806
She's, uh... she's someone I've known
for a real long time.

778
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:29,710
Her mom got sick,
so I lent her money to fly home.

779
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,645
That's it.

780
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,509
- You gotta go home soon, huh?
- Mm-hm.

781
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,249
In a little bit.

782
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,258
Good. You up for another surprise?

783
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,466
- It's so pretty.
- Yeah.

784
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,666
Hey, isn't that Calvin?

785
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:57,730
Out of the way!
You on the skates, out of the way!

786
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,038
That's the Zamboni King.

787
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,738
- I'm Canadian, I can't drive!
- Do you like to skate?

788
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,940
I'm actually pretty good at it.

789
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,007
Great. Then you can teach me.

790
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,985
You brought me here
and you don't know how to skate?

791
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,858
You really can't skate, can you?

792
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,896
I wouldn't lie to you.

793
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,025
Um...

794
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,331
There's something
that I need to tell you about Sy.

795
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,394
What's that?

796
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,767
Oh, gosh!

797
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,832
You OK?

798
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,242
- What would Sy think?
- Well, he...

799
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,385
- There is something I want to tell you.
- Watch out!

800
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,959
(Cal grunts a tune)

801
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,991
(strains)

802
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,054
(knock at door)

803
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,397
Hey, dude, is that you?

804
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,402
Who else would it be, Cal?

805
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,199
That's a fair point, I guess.

806
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,400
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm just taking a dump.

807
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:09,138
Ever wonder why they say "taking
a dump," not "leaving a dump"?

808
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:13,046
'Cause once it passes the rim,
I'm not reaching in there for anything.

809
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,448
You spend too much time alone, my friend.

810
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,957
- It gives me time to think.
- Depends on your definition of thinking.

811
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,119
Oh, yeah.

812
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,160
Cal, the light.

813
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,397
Quinn, the pants.

814
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:41,268
- What are you talking about?
- I thought we're playing word association.

815
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:45,042
- No. Just shut off the light.
- No, I'm too tired.

816
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,983
- You just walked past it.
- That should show you how tired I am.

817
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,713
(sighs)

818
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,256
You know, when I was in the bathroom
I was thinking.

819
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,554
- Aren't you glad we're not women?
- What?

820
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,186
Don't get me wrong -
having the boobs would be cool.

821
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:05,132
But girls have to find a place to go to
the bathroom. Guys, the world is our urinal.

822
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,934
Wow, Cal, that's...
that's really profound.

823
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:15,135
- Who said that, Nietzsche?
- Nie... No, dude, I just did.

824
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,407
Just shut off the light.

825
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,810
So, how's Tabby?

826
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:28,357
- It's Abby.
- That's what I said. Tabby.

827
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,360
- She's great.
- Cool.

828
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,363
So, what happens next?

829
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,563
I don't know. I like her,
but she's got this boyfriend.

830
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,202
Oh, yeah. She told me about that guy.
He sounds really cool.

831
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,974
Oh, yeah, no, you don't stand a chance.

832
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,073
Oh, great.

833
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,710
- She went out with you though, didn't she?
- Yeah.

834
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,983
Well, then maybe
she'll settle for somebody like you.

835
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,425
- Even if he is the hottest guy on the planet.
- She said that?

836
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,518
Oh, yeah. She went off...

837
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,895
Actually, you know what? That might've
been on TV. I don't remember.

838
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,859
Perfect.

839
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,909
(bulb shatters)

840
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:24,879
- Cal, the glass!
- Only hurts if you step on it, my friend.

841
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,939
- (crunch)
- Ow!

842
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,618
Good morning, darling one.

843
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,781
Good morning.

844
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,957
- You got home late last night.
- Hm.

845
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,462
Thought you were helping him
with his homework.

846
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,555
It was homework.

847
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,964
Oh, really? At the skating rink?

848
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,304
- That's a date.
- It wasn't a date.

849
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:55,968
Look, this is very hard for me, all right?

850
00:51:56,847 --> 00:52:01,307
I've never had to deal
with a real man in your life before.

851
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:05,343
- I don't wanna talk about this right now.
- Fine.

852
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:11,019
Well, next time you need me,
I might just be otherwise engaged.

853
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,120
(angry squeal)

854
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,599
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. How are you?

855
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:25,835
- Got us tickets to see Braid tonight.
- Oh, you did? Oh...

856
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,535
- It's on the house.
- Hm... Thanks.

857
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,706
I can't go.

858
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,944
Really? I thought we agreed
on studying tonight.

859
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:39,580
Yeah, I know we did. I just, you know...
I kinda promised Sy we'd do something.

860
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:44,320
All right. Cool.
Then, uh... I'll just see you in class.

861
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:46,852
OK.

862
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,837
(knocking)

863
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,136
It's open.

864
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,506
Wow. You look like crap.

865
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:11,783
Well, thanks.
I was working all night sorting books.

866
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,847
- Hey, is Abby home?
- Uh-uh.

867
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,353
Let me ask you something.

868
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,961
- Tell me about Sy.
- What?

869
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,024
You know, what's he like,
what does he look like?

870
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,898
Oh, uh...

871
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,236
Well, Sy is...
Well, he's kinda hard to describe.

872
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,979
- Well, he's here all the time, isn't he?
- Well, he works a lot.

873
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,776
Really? What does he do?

874
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,714
He's, uh...

875
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,952
Well, he...

876
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,851
Come on, it can't be that hard.

877
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:49,289
- Well, it's just that I...
- Yeah?

878
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,952
I don't want
to make you feel bad or anything.

879
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,327
Why would his work make me feel bad?

880
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,389
Well, because...

881
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,836
Because...

882
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,930
he's a lawyer.

883
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,901
Wow.

884
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,878
That's impressive.

885
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,512
What kind of lawyer is he?

886
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,176
Uh...

887
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,780
A good one.

888
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,729
You know the drill.
Books off the desks, no talking.

889
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:36,227
This is where I find out who simply
needs help and who is simply helpless.

890
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,675
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

891
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,219
- How'd you do on your test?
- I think I did OK.

892
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,276
That's good.

893
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,652
How come you didn't tell me
Sy was a lawyer?

894
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,816
Oh, um...

895
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,019
- I didn't?
- Yeah, Jess told me.

896
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,188
She did? That's... Well, there you go.

897
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:05,826
I was thinking maybe I could call him,
ask advice about internships, stuff like that.

898
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,735
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Great. What's his number?

899
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,399
You know, he's working
on a big case right now.

900
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,567
Really? What kind of case?

901
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,135
He works for the government,
so it's sorta shhh.

902
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,681
Oh, I understand.
Well, maybe he could call me.

903
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,980
Yeah, I will. I'll have him call you.
It's a good idea.

904
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,521
Abby? Where are you going?

905
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,952
Yeah, I have another class, it's that way.

906
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:37,625
You know what I think?
I think you need a break.

907
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,864
- I don't think so.
- I think you do, and I think you deserve it.

908
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,934
- Is it OK to leave our stuff here?
- Yeah. Just put it here.

909
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,205
Give me your hand.

910
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:55,049
- Why do you need the flashlight?
- Because it's gonna get dark.

911
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,109
- It is?
- Yeah.

912
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,823
Hey, what is this place?

913
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,518
Oh, it's...

914
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,054
Stupid... flashlight.

915
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,132
The flashlight's not working.

916
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,464
- Oh, my God!
- (screams)

917
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,230
(Quinn laughs)

918
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,434
- Don't leave me in the dark.
- You're a bad monkey.

919
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,104
It's the new dinosaur museum
the university's opening next month.

920
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,615
- Are we supposed to be in here?
- It's no big deal.

921
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,277
I don't think this is such a good idea.

922
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,650
My man Big Al is a security guy here.

923
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,248
He says as long as
we don't touch anything, we're cool.

924
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,452
Trust me.

925
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:42,157
Wow. This place is just... so amazing.

926
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,027
I told you.

927
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,137
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah, it's... great.

928
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,036
- (thud)
- Shh.

929
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,200
- What?
- Oh, it's Big Al. Hang on.

930
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,107
Oh, OK.

931
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,337
(footsteps)

932
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,983
- That's not Big Al. That's not Big Al!
- What?

933
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,986
Run!

934
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,553
(whistles a tune)

935
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,364
- (Quinn stifles giggles)
- Shh...

936
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,231
Please, please...

937
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,361
OK, I think he's gone.

938
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,501
- Come on, let's go this way.
- OK.

939
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,339
( "Make Me Wanna Fall" by Amy Collier)

940
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:40,453
 Don't you know I've lost control

941
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:45,051
 And that's OK with me

942
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:51,963
 You must think you're something special

943
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,971
 But that's OK with me

944
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,534
 Don't think that I can stop it

945
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,170
 When I'm with you

946
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,113
 You knocked me off of my feet.
You got me spinning around

947
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,015
 Turned my whole world upside down

948
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,315
 This thing drives me crazy

949
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,187
 Don't you make me wanna fall

950
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:22,097
 Think that love has taken hold now

951
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:26,101
 That's OK with me

952
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,671
 You knocked me off of my feet.
You got me spinning around

953
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,607
 Turned my whole world upside down

954
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,769
 This thing drives me crazy

955
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,372
 Don't you make me wanna fall

956
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:46,654
- Do you have something I could drink?
- Yeah. There's soda in the cooler.

957
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,691
Thanks.

958
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:51,853
Agh!

959
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,828
- Are you OK?
- Hello, darling one.

960
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,558
Yeah... Um... It...

961
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,465
Do you know how much I love this soda?

962
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,471
Look at him. I wonder how many
naive young women he's lured up here.

963
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,339
Under the pretext
of helping him with his homework.

964
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,378
- No soda?
- Um... Yeah, no.

965
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:15,448
No soda. Actually, I would never
like to have soda ever again.

966
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,880
OK.

967
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,444
So...

968
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,422
Sorry this place is such a wreck.
I wasn't expecting company.

969
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:27,452
And I think the last girl we had here...
was Cal's mom.

970
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,464
- Likely story.
- Really?

971
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:35,596
Don't you just love the way the surrealists
make our wildest imaginings come to life?

972
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,470
Neanderthal man, your thoughts?

973
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,803
Yeah.

974
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,276
Fascinating insight.

975
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,247
It's like a foreign language
we can understand,

976
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,512
but you just don't know how.

977
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:53,886
- Where the hell did that come from?
- That is beautiful.

978
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:57,115
- Thanks for walking me home.
- (Sy) It's nothing.

979
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,888
(Quinn) It's my pleasure.

980
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:05,026
You know, anytime Sy's out of town and
you need a walker-homer, I'm your guy.

981
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,867
- I'm not out of town. I'm very much in town.
- I'll let you know.

982
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:14,843
I was wondering... I'm sure you've already
got plans about Thanksgiving...

983
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,711
Actually, it's beer
and bacon sandwiches with Cal.

984
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,147
Abby, do not invite him to Thanksgiving.

985
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:25,813
Would you like to come to Thanksgiving
with me at my parents' house?

986
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:29,585
- You sure you want me to come?
- Yeah, I'm really sure.

987
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,562
- What about Sy?
- Yeah, what about me?

988
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:40,035
You know, he's English.
They don't really do Thanksgiving.

989
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:58,686
- So you invited him to your parents'?
- Yeah. I don't know what got into me.

990
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,451
Whatever it is, I think it's good.

991
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,425
Jess, I need you.

992
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,724
Can't you see I'm having my coffee break?

993
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:11,995
Yeah. It's just Thanksgiving's tomorrow
and we're only halfway through, so...

994
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:15,469
Are you harassing me
because of our prior relationship?

995
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:16,937
No, no. But...

996
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:21,272
- Do we need to call Corporate?
- No, no, no. No, that's fine.

997
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:27,544
No, you go ahead and just let me know
when you're... back, then.

998
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:31,811
That's fun.

999
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,380
So how are things going
between you and Quinn?

1000
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,323
They're going fine, thanks.

1001
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,884
Well, that's decisively indecisive.

1002
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,157
He's kinda cute.

1003
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,964
You haven't told him about Sy, have you?

1004
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,765
Uh-uh. I was going to, but I...

1005
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,897
Maybe it's time you let Sy go.

1006
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,506
No. It's not really that easy.

1007
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,838
- Well, sure it is.
- No, it's not.

1008
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,438
Jess, look at you.

1009
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,815
No offense, but every relationship
you get into seems to be dysfunctional.

1010
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:08,016
Abby, having an imaginary boyfriend
is textbook dysfunctionality.

1011
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,080
OK.

1012
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:12,719
It's like those paintings you do of him -
they're perfect,

1013
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,821
but you need to paint somebody that's real.

1014
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:20,062
Somebody that moves
and, you know, breathes.

1015
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,802
Hey! That's my face you're ripping up.

1016
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:31,142
No, it's hopeless.
My work, it's dead, it's lifeless.

1017
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:35,651
It is not. You can't listen to that bookstore
clerk. What did I tell you about real people?

1018
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,209
What if she's right
about painting real people?

1019
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,879
You mean like Quinn?

1020
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:43,221
Because I'm so boring and lifeless
and he's so full of manly vigor?

1021
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,022
- I didn't say that.
- Look, let me tell you something.

1022
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,723
I am pretty bored of this soppy, sweet,

1023
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,494
sexually nonthreatening persona
you've given me.

1024
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,468
"Oh, my darling,
nothing is too good for you."

1025
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:57,097
I do pretty well
with the material you've given me.

1026
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,472
Yes - that's exactly the problem.
I give you everything.

1027
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,376
- Maybe I need somebody who...
- Say no more. It's fine.

1028
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:07,405
I'll just go and see my other friends
who don't think I'm lifeless and boring.

1029
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,474
What other friends? You're imaginary.

1030
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,680
Do you really think
you're the only one who dreams me up?

1031
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:16,748
There are thousands of Ionely women
like you, and some men, who dream of me.

1032
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,192
Yeah. They lavish their affections on me.

1033
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,253
Granted, they may not be as attractive,

1034
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,528
but Millie from Minnesota is quite charming
if you can get past her accent.

1035
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,161
- Millie? From Minnesota?
- Yeah.

1036
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:33,675
So, I hope you have a spectacular painting
session with your Neanderthal boyfriend.

1037
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,836
Thank you.

1038
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,510
Oh, and by the way...

1039
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,982
I hate romantic comedies.

1040
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,541
Great!

1041
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,487
All right, pretty boy.
Come on, fire one in here.

1042
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,550
Oops. My bad.

1043
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:57,224
Let's go, chief. See if you can
get past the mighty Canadian!

1044
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,966
(groans)

1045
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,130
You OK?

1046
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,538
Mm-hm.

1047
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,905
Ohh...

1048
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,706
I'm good, baby.
Give me another one. Come on!

1049
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,441
But I hit you in the k-nuts.

1050
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,349
You only caught the right one.
I'm invincible. Slap it in!

1051
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,984
(groans)

1052
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,317
 O Canada

1053
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,794
 My home and native land

1054
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,024
Come on!

1055
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:33,797
- I'm going to Abby's for Thanksgiving.
- Should be fun. You, her and the lawyer.

1056
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,701
- He's not going.
- Oh.

1057
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,001
That's great. You can make your move.

1058
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,202
You know I'm not that guy.
Besides, we're just friends.

1059
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:44,678
Everything starts as "just friends,"
but the next thing you know...

1060
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,874
Oh, my God!

1061
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,080
I'm OK.

1062
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,844
This happens all the time, man.

1063
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:56,358
- Need help?
- Stuck in the net... I'm good.

1064
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,217
All right. I'm gonna get going.

1065
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:02,264
What? Hey, what about our feast?

1066
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,731
- Bacon and beer?
- It's Thanksgiving.

1067
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,564
- I think I'll take Abby.
- Over bacon?

1068
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,504
I like her more than swine, Cal.

1069
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,507
- It's love, man.
- Later, bro.

1070
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,940
Hey...

1071
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:18,003
You know, if you leave me
I'll just kinda look silly.

1072
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,810
All right. OK.

1073
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:24,146
- Here we go.
- Oh... Thanks.

1074
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,718
These are for you.

1075
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,953
I mean, if that's OK.

1076
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:39,559
Yeah, it's great. Thanks. I've never
been given flowers before. Thank you.

1077
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,262
Really?

1078
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:44,238
Well, you know, from anyone besides Sy.

1079
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,798
Yeah. Of course Sy. I mean...

1080
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:50,972
Those are more like
"Hey, happy Thanksgiving" flowers.

1081
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,844
Idiot!

1082
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:56,883
 On a day like today

1083
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:01,617
 I could take a chance
on someone new...

1084
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:06,894
(Abby) I want you to think of this
as a new experience. OK?

1085
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,455
- Which house is yours?
- Trust me, you'll know.

1086
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,766
- Your parents really get into this, huh?
- Yeah.

1087
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,712
- You shoulda seen it for the garlic festival.
- The what?

1088
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,516
I'll tell you later.

1089
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,850
- You ring your own doorbell?
- Yeah. It's safer.

1090
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:40,286
Happy Turkey Day!
Come in, come in.

1091
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:44,163
Your father will be out in a moment.
Very nice to see you again, Quentin.

1092
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:48,397
Look who's here! Good.
Mary Louise, where's my turkey head?

1093
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,235
In the attic, next to your Frankenstein suit.

1094
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,639
The attic? Great!

1095
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,234
Well, come on.
I have some Pilgrim Punch for you.

1096
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:59,042
- OK.
- I make a mean gobbler cobbler.

1097
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:06,478
Look out, turkey coming through.
Watch my tail.

1098
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,547
- I'll just take some of this.
- George!

1099
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:14,562
You do that again, I am gonna have
Quentin tie you to the table and baste you!

1100
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:18,532
Besides, I think a turkey eating turkey
is cannibalistic.

1101
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,502
Man, you guys have been everywhere.

1102
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,597
Yeah, we used to travel all over the place.

1103
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:31,246
- There's no pictures of Abby.
- Well, she was usually taking the pictures.

1104
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,838
That's when we went to the Grand Canyon.

1105
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:36,714
Abby, when were we
at the Grand Canyon?

1106
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:39,118
I've never been to the Grand Canyon.

1107
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:43,557
Oh, yeah.
We usually left her with her Aunt Edna.

1108
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,424
- Hey, that reminds me of a joke.
- Quinn, come on.

1109
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,191
- Why did the police arrest the turkey?
- We'll be back.

1110
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,495
Where are you going?
We're eating in an hour.

1111
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,365
He was suspected of fowl play.

1112
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:58,271
- Oh, Father.
- That's a funny joke, sweetie.

1113
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:03,878
Sorry about rushing you out of there.
You know, dad jokes are not really funny.

1114
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:10,010
So anyways, this is the place I went to
when, you know, parents were... parents.

1115
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,145
I hear you. My dad's a shrink.

1116
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,679
- Really?
- Yeah. Psychoanalyzes everyone.

1117
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,192
Cal hasn't been to the house
in some time.

1118
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,821
- That makes sense.
- Yeah, obvious reasons.

1119
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,162
- Do you swing?
- I swing, yes.

1120
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,293
Oh!

1121
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,499
I remember them being so much larger.

1122
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,671
- It's kinda scary growing up, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

1123
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:42,046
So, is this where
you and Mr. Wonderful hang out?

1124
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,052
Jealous?

1125
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,952
No, I'm not jealous.

1126
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:49,684
Someone's jealous!

1127
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,489
I love these things!

1128
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,995
I hate them. They make me nauseous.

1129
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:58,363
- Are you kidding me?
- They're the worst. They're awful.

1130
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,130
- Come on. Real quick, for me.
- No.

1131
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,229
30 seconds. What's the worst
that can happen in 30 seconds?

1132
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,673
- I don't want to.
- 30 seconds and you're free.

1133
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:10,507
- OK?
- OK. But go slow.

1134
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,877
- Slow!
- I haven't even started yet.

1135
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:15,439
- You're going too fast.
- Now I'm gonna start.

1136
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,112
I'm getting dizzy. I'm gonna throw up.

1137
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,178
No, please...

1138
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,190
It's not that bad.

1139
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,750
It's OK, you're safe with me.
Just hold on.

1140
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,802
Oh...

1141
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,799
Agh!

1142
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:43,007
Well, I've just about
got the bleeding stopped.

1143
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,047
- This is really embarrassing.
- I'm sorry.

1144
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:49,084
I was a field medic in 'Nam -
I've seen worse than this.

1145
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:52,382
Dad, it's OK. I don't think
he's gonna need your services.

1146
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:56,151
When I was a kid on the playground,
never a scratch. Now look at me.

1147
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,820
Abby used to come home every other day
with a bump or a bruise.

1148
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:03,763
- She always blamed it on Sy.
- Mom. You don't have to talk about that.

1149
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,630
What about Sy? He ever get hurt?

1150
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,570
Mom, there's those buns. Right?
You don't want them to burn, do you?

1151
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:14,905
- Sy never got hurt.
- Yeah... (sniffs) I smell something.

1152
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,172
They're on fire! Oh, my gosh!

1153
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,939
There's something...
It's burning in the kitchen.

1154
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:24,975
Oh, there's nothing burning.
You're imagining things.

1155
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,750
- No, Mom, I'm not imagining...
- Agh! Agh!

1156
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,087
You imagine things all the time.

1157
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,261
Well, what about Sy?
Her perfect imaginary friend.

1158
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,095
At what age did you finally give him up?

1159
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,765
Honey, look, the meat.
The meat is frozen to his head now.

1160
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,168
Ooh! Yipeys!

1161
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,298
- Careful.
- It's OK.

1162
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:48,775
Don't let the dog out.
Don't let the dog out.

1163
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,383
- I have been trying to tell you.
- Really?

1164
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:02,356
- Will you please just let me?
- Explain? Explain that you lied to me?

1165
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,793
That you blew me off
for somebody who doesn't even exist?

1166
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:14,034
Abby, I felt guilty having feelings for you.

1167
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,334
And it's all because
you made me believe you had a boyfriend.

1168
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:20,705
I didn't make him up because of you.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1169
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,903
Please, tell me.

1170
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:31,617
I didn't have parents that understood
that raising me was a job.

1171
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,952
I just kind of felt like this accessory.

1172
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:40,855
I don't know if you've ever
really felt Ioneliness before,

1173
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,589
but I have.

1174
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:50,236
You know, the Sy
that you keep hearing about is...

1175
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,299
is just the place that I went to
that made it easier.

1176
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,643
I don't know what to say.

1177
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,748
I'm sorry.

1178
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,619
That I...

1179
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,558
Sorry.

1180
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,889
I'm gonna go.

1181
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:19,533
Yeah... I think you should.

1182
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,039
Abby...

1183
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,640
Take this.

1184
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,423
( "Wound Up In You" by Ted Bruner)

1185
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,556
 Somehow I got myself

1186
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,535
 Wound up in you...

1187
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,094
(grunts)

1188
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,005
Quinn!

1189
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,506
Quinn? Quinn.

1190
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:05,012
Hey-hey-hey, buddy.
Little help, baby.

1191
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,881
Come on, man. The blood's rushing
to my head. I'm starting to feel woozy.

1192
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,978
Oh, yeah... Hey, a dime.

1193
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,990
(Sy) You're gonna get over him,
and I'm gonna be here to help you.

1194
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,326
You've just never fallen
for a real guy before.

1195
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,290
You've never felt real pain.

1196
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:31,230
But I'm not sure I've felt real love either.

1197
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:38,376
 I was much better off

1198
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,173
 Before

1199
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,345
 I got wound up

1200
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,485
 In you

1201
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:58,257
- Did you find everything OK?
- Yeah. I love the new setup.

1202
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,791
- Oh, wonderful. Happy holidays.
- Thank you.

1203
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,859
(gasps)

1204
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,669
There are two people from Corporate here
and they're looking for me.

1205
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,711
Do they look mad?

1206
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,046
Ryan, I think you should know something.

1207
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,142
What?

1208
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,244
Excuse me, Miss?

1209
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:26,091
Well, those two guys from Corporate...
They weren't from Corporate.

1210
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,527
They weren't?

1211
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:32,897
- It was my cousin and his roommate.
- Your cousin works for Corporate?

1212
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,367
Hello?

1213
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,871
No. My cousin did it to get my job back.

1214
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,075
(bell rings)

1215
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,442
Look, this register's...

1216
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,274
It's for you.

1217
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,449
Are you Ryan Sanders?

1218
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:53,577
Yeah, I'm Ryan Sanders.

1219
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:58,092
We've been getting some calls on some
changes you've been making in your store.

1220
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,788
- I can explain.
- Very impressive.

1221
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,058
Most of this is her fault...

1222
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,590
- You like it?
- Yes.

1223
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,158
- You really like it?
- Like it? We love it!

1224
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,329
Love it.

1225
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:13,101
Well, we...
Ryan and I came up with it together.

1226
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,541
Then you both should be commended.

1227
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:19,172
Our company needs more self-motivated
employees like the two of you.

1228
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,216
We'll be keeping our eyes on you -

1229
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,719
since we'll be needing
a new regional manager before too long.

1230
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:29,655
Of course, that's if your lovely assistant
is willing to become manager here.

1231
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:42,635
You know, you could've
taken all the credit for yourself.

1232
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:47,266
- Why didn't you?
- Because we did it, Ryan. As a team.

1233
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:51,039
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did, huh?

1234
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:58,711
You know, there's a nice way
to handle the books, and that wasn't it.

1235
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,888
You're funny.
You're a funny girl, really.

1236
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,722
(tutor) I have mixed emotions
with your results.

1237
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:09,161
Some of you, I was pleasantly surprised.

1238
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,722
Others, disappointed.

1239
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,966
But most of you performed
exactly as I'd expected.

1240
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,334
Oh. Hey, Quinn.

1241
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,036
Quinn, what did you get on the test?

1242
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,907
Wow, a B. That's great.

1243
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,976
We've both kept our part of the deal.

1244
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:31,577
Yeah. So when do you wanna start
studying for the final?

1245
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:34,417
I think I'll be better on my own.

1246
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,516
What are you doing?

1247
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,221
Changing.

1248
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,288
To what?

1249
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,296
I don't know yet.

1250
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:34,178
This is looking a little tired, too.
And it's got dirt on it.

1251
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,711
I sure wish Abby'd come with us sometime.

1252
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,381
She could bring that friend of hers, Quinn.

1253
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:45,654
Oh, wouldn't that be fun?
I sure do like him.

1254
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:49,356
- He seems like a nice fellow.
- Tall, too.

1255
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:15,422
I guess this means
things can get back to normal.

1256
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,550
Our relationship isn't normal, Sy.

1257
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:25,497
You can't hold me, or kiss me, or...

1258
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,194
The thing is...

1259
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:36,968
The thing is that...

1260
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:40,708
The thing is
that it's time for me to say goodbye.

1261
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,345
I know.

1262
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,914
I can't imagine my life without you.

1263
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,384
That's what happens.

1264
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:56,692
Girls grow up and then they leave
their imaginary boyfriends.

1265
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,899
I'm sorry that I clung on so hard.

1266
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,935
I just couldn't bear to see you suffer.

1267
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,538
I'm gonna miss you.

1268
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,875
I'm gonna miss you too.

1269
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,886
Good luck with, uh... with Quinn.

1270
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:26,323
- He's gonna come back to you.
- I don't know.

1271
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:32,993
Just don't be too hard on him if he doesn't
want to go to lots of romantic movies.

1272
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,665
Most guys, they don't like that stuff.

1273
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,014
Sy.

1274
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,512
Thank you.

1275
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:17,311
Sweetie, I'm so glad you came.

1276
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,573
- Hi.
- It's so much better with you here.

1277
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,174
Well, it's time to try something new.

1278
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:26,277
- Hey, is everybody ready?
- Yeah.

1279
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,254
All righty.

1280
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,881
Ha-ha!

1281
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:33,558
Oh.

1282
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:38,232
- Honey, it's not too impressive.
- Oh, it's terrific.

1283
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,599
Just wait till tonight.
It's gonna look wonderful.

1284
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,629
- You sure I'm not adopted?
- Oh, I love you too, dear.

1285
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:51,410
- Should we tell her about her headstone?
- Let's save that for Christmas Day.

1286
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:06,183
 You'll never feel like this again

1287
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:11,326
 So remember

1288
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:17,027
 The look on my face forever...

1289
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,965
It could be fun.

1290
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,907
Thanks, but... I don't think so, Sarah.

1291
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,408
Hey, call me if you change your mind.

1292
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,248
Bye.

1293
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:36,116
(acoustic guitar)

1294
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,125
 Cookin'

1295
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,956
 Bacon

1296
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,189
 I love bacon!

1297
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:45,290
(dramatic vocalization)

1298
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,701
- There you go. There it is.
- Cal, what are you doing?

1299
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:57,643
Hey. What's goin' on?
That's my cousin Jasper,

1300
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:00,943
and this is my stepmother's
half-brother's son Darwin.

1301
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,849
Yeah, you got it.
What's up? How's it goin'?

1302
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:07,480
We're just getting our music down,
because we're gonna record an album.

1303
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:11,685
 Wha wha wha wha wha whaaaaaaa

1304
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,252
Ladies and gentlemen, The Crazy Pucks.

1305
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,628
- We're awesome.
- Fitting.

1306
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:21,829
- Dude, it's below freezing out here.
- I think the cold helps our musical ability.

1307
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:24,531
So, how's the old dating game going?

1308
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,904
Man, it's like a bad reality show.

1309
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,966
That good, huh?

1310
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,241
No, Cal, that's bad.

1311
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:32,507
Oh.

1312
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:37,745
Is there ever a time when eight of the ten
voices in your head agree on one thing?

1313
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,083
I don't know. I've never asked them.

1314
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,056
But I know that they wanna know
why you walked away from Abby.

1315
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:48,926
- Why you walked away from Abby!
-  Why did you walk away from Abby?

1316
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:51,761
- Make it Ab-by.
-  Ab-byyy

1317
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:56,065
-  Now he's walking away from us
-  Both of us

1318
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,163
-  I better go, he's fragile
-  Now you're walking away from me

1319
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,936
 I gotta go. He's fragile and like a girl...
Work with that.

1320
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:06,743
 Please don't take my sandwich,
'cause that's what I like to eat

1321
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,510
That was rude.

1322
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,054
We had issues.

1323
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,858
You're the one
who's got issues with commitment.

1324
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:26,992
Take it from somebody who's been
committed, let love take care of itself.

1325
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:30,970
That makes about as much sense
as a kamikaze pilot wearing a helmet.

1326
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,940
Hey, just because
somebody's a practicing kamikaze

1327
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,204
does not mean they shouldn't be safe.

1328
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,768
Kamikaze pilots committed suicide, Cal.

1329
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,476
Yeah. They understood commitment.

1330
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:48,550
You don't understand.
Her boyfriend, she made him up.

1331
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:51,387
He doesn't exist. He's imaginary.

1332
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:55,020
So? When I was growing up,
I was the kid next door's imaginary friend.

1333
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:57,929
- Not funny.
- Yeah. It wasn't for me either.

1334
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:02,732
Thinking 'cause I'm imaginary I didn't need
the bathroom. Worst month of my life.

1335
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:06,102
Cal, please, just two seconds, man.

1336
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,574
There's no such thing
as the perfect woman, bro.

1337
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,842
She just doesn't exist.

1338
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:18,044
The only thing I know
is that since you met her

1339
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:21,179
you're the happiest I've ever seen you.

1340
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,656
I'm not happy right now.

1341
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:28,662
Well, maybe that's because you're sitting
here talking to the wrong person.

1342
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,899
Jess.

1343
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,630
- Know where I could find Abby?
- She's not here.

1344
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:39,229
- Do you know where she is?
- No.

1345
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:42,299
And I don't think she's up to seeing you.

1346
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:45,505
- Because of Sy?
- Because of you.

1347
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,945
Me?

1348
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,647
You are the first real guy she's ever loved,

1349
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:54,347
and at the first sign of trouble,
what did you do?

1350
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,947
Jess, please, I just wanna find her.

1351
01:24:57,025 --> 01:25:02,327
Excuse me, I was wondering if you could
help me find a book on the mating rituals...

1352
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:06,065
of the African dung beetle.

1353
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,537
I know exactly where that book is.

1354
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,438
OK, well... I'm gonna get going.

1355
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:16,102
Just let me know if you see her.

1356
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:21,315
Thank you...

1357
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,213
Abdul.

1358
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,981
No, actually it's Jess.

1359
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:29,023
That's pretty too.

1360
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,115
- And your name?
- David.

1361
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:33,660
David.

1362
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,293
David.

1363
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,857
I like that name.

1364
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:42,766
 I saw her face in the clouds

1365
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,772
 Before the rain

1366
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:50,801
 It felt good to see you again

1367
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,939
 Then it all washed away

1368
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,745
 I can't explain

1369
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:00,846
 How I miss you

1370
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,323
 If I'd only known

1371
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,987
 How much this would hurt

1372
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:13,762
 How I would be craving
to be in your world

1373
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,770
 Now I know

1374
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:22,710
 I should've never let you go

1375
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:56,705
Abby?

1376
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:14,022
- I saw your painting.
- I wanted to paint something real.

1377
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,995
Who are those for?

1378
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,402
They're for you.

1379
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:26,668
That is, if...
Sy doesn't have a problem with it.

1380
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,010
He's gone.

1381
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:33,372
You know I'm not perfect.

1382
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,544
I'm not looking for perfect anymore.

( "This Could Be Everything"
by Paul Umbach)

1384
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,750
 This could be everything

1385
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,626
 Everything that we want

1386
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,901
 I feel my heart begin to race

1387
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:56,198
 Every time I see your face

1388
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,364
 You're everything

1389
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,237
 That I wish I'd ever known

1390
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:05,341
 It's the meaning of why I am here

1391
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,280
 Turn to me. Don't disappear

1392
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:14,254
 I want you to be right here with me

1393
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,852
 This could be

1394
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:22,862
 The feeling that our love's forsaken

1395
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,465
 But don't be afraid of

1396
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:34,373
 Never learning how to fall in love

1397
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:37,002
 And maybe

1398
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:40,013
 We will be

1399
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:45,280
 As one

1400
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:48,151
 This could be everything

1401
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:51,123
 Everything that we want

1402
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:55,192
 It's a world that I begin to see

1403
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:57,731
 Every time you're next to me

1404
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:59,926
 You're everything

1405
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:03,129
 I need you in my heart

1406
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:06,834
 It's the meaning of why I am here

1407
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,808
 So turn to me. My love

1408
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,640
 This could be everything

1409
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:14,705
 Everything that we want

1410
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,583
 Hold me here beside you now

1411
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:21,588
 I need to feel your touch somehow

1412
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:26,650
 You'll never ever find a love like mine

1413
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:29,856
 No. No

1415
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:43,034
 Hey. Baby. where are you?

1416
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:46,547
 I'm wanting to love you all over

1417
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:49,082
 Come closer

1418
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,913
 Kiss me

1419
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:55,115
 I know you've got to miss me

1420
01:29:55,189 --> 01:30:01,219
 Well. It would be so damn fine

1421
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:06,261
 In your arms

1422
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:10,232
 In your arms

1423
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:14,396
 In your arms

1424
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:17,538
 I wish that this could last forever

1425
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:20,080
 In your arms

1426
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:27,114
 I can feel your toes

1427
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:30,988
 They're snuggled up to mine

1428
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:34,926
 I wish you'd just wake up

1429
01:30:34,996 --> 01:30:39,399
 And hold me through the night

1430
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:45,406
 Well. It would be so divine

1431
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:50,441
 In your arms

1432
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:54,448

 I wish that this could last forever

1439
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:21,232
 You're touching

1440
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,174
 My hair

1441
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:27,146
 I'm getting tingles I swear

1442
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:28,944
 You move

1443
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:31,075
 Close to me

1444
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:34,485
 And I am set...

1445
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,616
 Free

01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,984
 Free

 In your arms
