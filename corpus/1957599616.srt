1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:01,634
(silence)

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,603
[music playing]

3
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,230
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): I rise to this day.

4
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:33,500
I rise to this hour.

5
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:40,306
Called by the silent, irresistible fire.

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,276
For this, I was born.

7
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,613
For this, I was raised.

8
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:51,951
I must carry the light so the truth might be saved.

9
00:00:54,554 --> 00:01:01,528
I rush like the wind, I will charge toward my fate.

10
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:08,268
Fear wins the day if I dare hesitate.

11
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:14,974
I must reach for the hand that's reaching for me.

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,977
I am the companion of destiny.

13
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,317
I will fight endless nights.

14
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,123
I will ride with the sun 'til evil is banished

15
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,091
and honor has won.

16
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,094
Dragons will fall.

17
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,864
Our banners will fly!

18
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:48,007
Justice will reign and peace will rise on a glorious quest

19
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,609
for eternal dawn.

20
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,782
I sail on the dreams of Avalon.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,555
NARRATOR: This is Avalon.

22
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,458
This is where King Arthur lived when he was young, and

23
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,128
where he is buried, and where he yet waits.

24
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:15,902
Avalon is always there, but it is not always easy to see.

25
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,870
-Vivian.

26
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,137
I know you're watching me.

27
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,041
Stop playing about and come down here.

28
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,943
I need your help, blast it.

29
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,844
Here.

30
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,545
You take it for a while.

31
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,253
-Well meant, friend Merlin.

32
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,854
What have you there?

33
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,911
I name you this night, Arthur. you shall live between the two

34
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,445
worlds mortal and immortal.

35
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,048
You are of England and shall one day return there, but you

36
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:07,854
are also now of Avalon, and this shall be your true home.

37
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,822
-We cannot keep him here.

38
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,757
All of you know that.

39
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,491
-And why not?

40
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,659
Because he is a boy?

41
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,861
-Sister, I tell you, it is not fit.

42
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,195
-Not fit?

43
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,565
His whole village burned around him, his family

44
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,435
destroyed, and it is not fit for us to shelter him?

45
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,203
Oh Merlin, speak to them.

46
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,105
-You know they won't listen to me.

47
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,473
After all, I'm a man.

48
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,809
This is for Avalon to decide.

49
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:34,213
-And if we turn him away, we will deserve our ruin.

50
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,915
We are not alone.

51
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,116
We are not separate.

52
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,285
-Avalon is not of the world.

53
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,186
We are above it.

54
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,588
-Hush.

55
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,992
All of you.

56
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,361
We will teach this boy the ways of Avalon, and when he is

57
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,731
of age, my sister Morgause will teach him the lessons of

58
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,201
love, and then he will be sent into the world to bring the

59
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,538
wisdom of Avalon into the battling chaos.

60
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,108
And maybe, just maybe, to bring peace.

61
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,826
-It's so beautiful, Aunt Vivian.

62
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,393
What--

63
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,494
What does it do?

64
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,161
-Ah.

65
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,463
There's a human for you.

66
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,531
So beautiful, but it has to do something too.

67
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,769
Well, inside is a wise spirit that can tell you your future.

68
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,137
Think, Arthur.

69
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,707
Imagine finding out right now, this minute, what your life

70
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,908
will be like.

71
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,479
-Lancelot du Lac.

72
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,814
I came to offer you my sword.

73
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,650
-Forever your servant.

74
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:48,187
CRYSTAL BALL: Those whom you trust most beware of you.

75
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:48,788
-No!

76
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,455
No!

77
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,957
I don't wanna know.

78
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,708
-Careful, child.

79
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,676
-Merlin.

80
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,743
Merlin, I--

81
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,779
I don't want to be a mouse anymore, ever.

82
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,980
-Don't you?

83
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,314
But what about them?

84
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,717
You were out foraging for their breakfast.

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,253
They're waiting for you to come home.

86
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,321
You must look beyond your own fears, Arthur.

87
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,723
To help others.

88
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,464
-I'm flying.

89
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,539
-And now--

90
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,674
Now what are you feeling?

91
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,909
-I feel hungry.

92
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,343
Looking for something to eat.

93
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,511
Maybe some berries.

94
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,314
Certainly not the poor mouse.

95
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,083
-And what can you see?

96
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,718
-I can see forever.

97
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,722
The water and beyond the great shores of England.

98
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,057
Wee!

99
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,960
-(SINGING) Be a bird.

100
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,830
Take flight into your freedom.

101
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:09,569
Fly above man's harsh and angry words.

102
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:16,275
In the sky, there are no walls, no boundaries.

103
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,747
There, an endless peace flows undisturbed.

104
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:29,322
Be a stream that's winding through the forest, joining in

105
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:34,227
the water strong and deep.

106
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,733
Ride the raging rapids of your journey.

107
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,135
Sail the waves.

108
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:48,074
Surrender to the sea.

109
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:53,446
Love the Earth and the sky.

110
00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:00,720
In creation's song, hear the force of nature's cry.

111
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:06,692
When you know the song of every bird.

112
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:12,865
When you understand the river's words, when you can

113
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:21,674
befriend the wind and name the stars, you will never be

114
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:27,113
afraid and you will never be alone.

115
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:37,423
Be a tree, so solemn in the winter.

116
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:43,429
Come alive with glory in the spring.

117
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:49,802
Be serene in golden days of summer.

118
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:57,410
Let your leaves dance free in autumn's breeze.

119
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:04,150
When you know the song of every bird, when you

120
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:11,657
understand the river's words, when you can befriend the wind

121
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:21,934
and name the stars, you will never be afraid and you will

122
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,938
never be alone.

123
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:34,480
Can you feel the power of the rising sun burning in your

124
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:38,784
heart, just like a flame?

125
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:46,225
Can you feel the sweetness of the newborn moon as the

126
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,761
heavens call your name?

127
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:58,571
When you know the song of every bird, when you

128
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:06,646
understand the river's words, when you can befriend the wind

129
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:15,221
and name the stars, you will never be afraid and you will

130
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,357
never be alone.

131
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,874
Are there any boundaries and any lines on the land?

132
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,942
-No, Merlin.

133
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,777
Just one great expanse.

134
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,545
MERLIN (OFFSCREEN): Remember that, Arthur.

135
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,382
When men of fighting for land, remember that there is only

136
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,484
one land and that the boundaries are

137
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,019
only in man's mind.

138
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,860
-The rhythm Arthur.

139
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,163
One, hop, two, hop.

140
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,264
No, don't look at your feet.

141
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,765
Dancing isn't feet.

142
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,067
Dancing is feeling.

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,336
Close your eyes and feel how it must go.

144
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,303
again now.

145
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,072
One hop, two, hop, three--

146
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,039
Ouch.

147
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,441
-Sorry.

148
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,144
-Bless you Morgause.

149
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,347
See what you can do with him.

150
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,482
there's a good girl.

151
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,829
-England?

152
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,963
-England.

153
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,598
Your home, Arthur.

154
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,299
-Wh--

155
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,166
What's happening there?

156
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,468
What are they doing?

157
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,869
-I will show you.

158
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,821
-No, please.

159
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,389
Merlin!

160
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,857
Make it stop.

161
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,958
-I cannot.

162
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,127
This is your destiny.

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,962
To put those fires out.

164
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,164
To build a place of peace.

165
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,298
-No.

166
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,833
No, I don't want a destiny, Merlin.

167
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,404
I only want to stay here on Avalon, and marry Morgause,

168
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,405
and have a life.

169
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,639
Like everyone else.

170
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:14,740
-Ah, my boy.

171
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,043
I would give you that, gladly, if I could.

172
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,949
[music playing]

173
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,089
-Aha!

174
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,939
NARRATOR: The union of Arthur and Morgause was a magical

175
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,810
day, for indeed it united Arthur's real world of England

176
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:54,380
with a bit of the enchanted world of Avalon in the hopes

177
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,683
that one day the two worlds might be one.

178
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,685
[music playing]

179
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,901
-Arthur, look.

180
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,809
NARRATOR: And Arthur learned how to love

181
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,212
well, perhaps too well.

182
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,315
And these were his final lessons on Avalon.

183
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,282
-Morgause?

184
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,183
Morgause?

185
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,385
Where did you go?

186
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,387
-Ah, there you are.

187
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,789
That's a relief.

188
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,991
It would have been a pity to start without you.

189
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,259
-Start what?

190
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,861
-I'll get to that.

191
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,906
-I just pull it out of the stone?

192
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,374
-If you can.

193
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,843
For centuries, thousands have tried, but only the new

194
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,447
rightful king of England can pull it from its place.

195
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,815
-Arthur can do it.

196
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,083
-I don't know.

197
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,950
I don't think--

198
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:05,951
-Take the sword, boy.

199
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,838
-Arthur of Avalon, the name of your sword is Excalibur.

200
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,206
It will defend you well.

201
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,010
But remember, the day you draw it for an unjust purpose, it

202
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,212
will turn to dust in your hands.

203
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,713
Use it honorably.

204
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,784
-It is your charge to cross the water to England, and

205
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,953
there build a mighty refuge for those who are not might,

206
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,924
but who have hope for world and peace, and this place

207
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,592
shall be called Camelot.

208
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,962
And to it shall come the greatest knights of the land.

209
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,533
Not to win glory, but to protect the weak and the

210
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:54,900
humble.

211
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,668
-I--

212
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,268
I am nothing.

213
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,269
I am nobody.

214
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,637
Nobody from nowhere.

215
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,139
You've taught me everything I know.

216
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,542
In my heart, Avalon will always be my home.

217
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,918
Merlin, Vivian.

218
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,320
couldn't you two come with me?

219
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,121
Even just for a little while?

220
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,924
-As though we've nothing else to do but look out for you?

221
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,759
Well, Go ahead.

222
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,927
Say goodbye.

223
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,897
-You won't always see us, but we'll be there.

224
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,731
Like Avalon.

225
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,599
Farewell, Arthur.

226
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,233
-Wait.

227
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,067
Where's Morgause?

228
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,101
Isn't she coming?

229
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,569
-She cannot make the crossing.

230
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,172
Her place is in Avalon, like all of us.

231
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,175
She cannot exist in the real world.

232
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,776
We're not like you, Arthur.

233
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,144
You are mortal.

234
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,148
But believe that one day, the two of you will be together.

235
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,750
You must go on without her.

236
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,751
Without us all.

237
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,852
-Tell Morgause--

238
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:51,557
Vivian, please, tell Morgause I love her.

239
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,558
-Arthur.

240
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,759
-Morgause.

241
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,761
[screaming]

242
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,162
-Come on, Arthur.

243
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:30,796
Think.

244
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,864
Think!

245
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,766
Merlin said you have to go in low, right

246
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,967
under the front legs.

247
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,421
[sneeze]

248
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,022
-Are you hurt, sir knight?

249
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,624
-Uh, no, no.

250
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,625
Not a bit.

251
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,626
[sneeze]

252
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,060
I--

253
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,361
I--

254
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,529
I've just always been allergic to dragons.

255
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,230
Merlin-- that's my teacher--

256
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,367
he says it's a little unusual.

257
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,471
-To thank you for saving me.

258
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,872
-Uh.

259
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,274
Guinevere.

260
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,508
-Yes.

261
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,477
I'm forever in your service, kind sir.

262
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,582
I ran away from home because they had arranged for me to

263
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,884
marry a very wealthy landlord twice my age.

264
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,419
-Gosh.

265
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,888
So, where are you going now, fair Guinevere?

266
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,223
-I have nowhere to go.

267
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,658
-Then come with me to Camelot.

268
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,631
-Arthur, I don't know if you can make the strong people

269
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,134
stop hurting the weak ones, taking from

270
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,369
them, killing them.

271
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,204
I mean, that's what strong people do.

272
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,105
-No, no.

273
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,272
That's just it, Gwen.

274
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,273
That's not being strong.

275
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,475
That's being cruel.

276
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,976
It's not the same thing at all.

277
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,479
-Where I come from, we can't tell the difference.

278
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,881
-Well, where I come from, there are a lot of strong

279
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,551
people, but they don't hurt anybody, not ever.

280
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,252
-Arthur.

281
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,088
Tell me about Avalon.

282
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,593
-In Avalon, they taught my how to live an Morgause taught me

283
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,794
how to love.

284
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,196
There will always be a place for her in my heart.

285
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,299
But I had to go on to the real world, a world of which she

286
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,701
cannot be a part.

287
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,213
[neighing]

288
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,481
Um, I'll be right back.

289
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,916
You spread out the picnic.

290
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,331
-Ack.

291
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,333
I could've handled them alone.

292
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,501
-I'm sure you could.

293
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,036
I'm the one who needed the practice.

294
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,504
My name's Arthur.

295
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,073
Um, could I talk to you about a place called Camelot?

296
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,475
-Sure, laddie.

297
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,075
-Good sir, may we know your name

298
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,577
and, uh, buy you breakfast?

299
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,748
-Befriending the poor and the weak?

300
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,716
What?

301
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,284
You mean instead of robbing them?

302
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,420
Well, it would be a change, I'll say that.

303
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,021
-Water's the main thing, of course.

304
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,189
Water and elevation.

305
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,924
You'll want two wells, not one.

306
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,825
Two.

307
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,359
Right within the walls.

308
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,694
Absolutely.

309
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,996
You see, the idea is to command the roads in all

310
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,498
directions.

311
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,533
That was nobody can surprise you, and you'll see a fat

312
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,136
caravan miles off and come down on it like a hawk, like a

313
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,871
bolt of lightning.

314
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,206
-Oh, we wouldn't be attacking caravans.

315
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,809
We'd be protecting them.

316
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,043
-Protecting them?

317
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,178
I see.

318
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,212
And, uh, where is it you wanted to

319
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,082
build this, uh, Camelot?

320
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,216
-Well I was--

321
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,051
I've been thinking about Cornwall.

322
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:13,919
-Cornwall?

323
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,455
Oh I say, Cornwall?

324
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,624
What on Earth is in Cornwall?

325
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
-Ach.

326
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,126
Why Cornwall?

327
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,394
-Sometimes--

328
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,930
Sometimes you can see Avalon from there.

329
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,646
-Ach.

330
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,483
You can't make me believe a castle to be round.

331
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,250
Ha!

332
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,518
They'll never believe it.

333
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,853
-No corners to defend.

334
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,855
Very important.

335
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,423
Keeps people from tunneling underneath.

336
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,724
All right, lower!

337
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,492
Lower it now!

338
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,860
-Watch your feet, Gawain.

339
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,630
It's odd, Palamedes.

340
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,933
Here we are, all of us, building our castle, and yet I

341
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,435
keep imagining a time when there won't be any castles,

342
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,904
when people won't need them anymore.

343
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,506
When all this fighting is over.

344
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,507
-Ah.

345
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,474
It'll be over when there's none of us

346
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,209
left standing, Arthur.

347
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,678
That's how you'll tell.

348
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,880
-They're building a castle to protect the common folk.

349
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,248
-Like us.

350
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,183
-No more attrition!

351
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,818
-Come on, let's go help them.

352
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,766
-They will come, won't they, Gawain?

353
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,134
When they hear about us?

354
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,369
About Camelot?

355
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,937
GAWAIN (OFFSCREEN): aye they'll come.

356
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,074
Some to join you, and some to tear the place down around

357
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,275
your ears, Arthur.

358
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,077
We best be ready for those.

359
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,779
GUINEVERE (OFFSCREEN): I do rather hope there'll be some

360
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,881
ladies too.

361
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,551
NARRATOR: And they did come, just as we had hoped.

362
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,621
The greatest knights in all of Europe did hear about Camelot,

363
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,857
and many of them came to join Arthur.

364
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,825
-Lancelot.

365
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,159
Lancelot du Lac.

366
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,062
I am the son of King Ban of Benwick.

367
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,931
I come to offer you my sword.

368
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,200
-I have heard of you, Sir Lancelot, and you are indeed

369
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,668
most welcome at Camelot.

370
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,637
May I present you to the lady Guinevere?

371
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,944
-My lord, if you would set me immediately to my quest?

372
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,245
-Your quest?

373
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,813
-Ha.

374
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,816
Oh, you mean being sent off after some dragon, some giant,

375
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,084
things like that?

376
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,454
Well, I'm sorry, we haven't time for any quests just now.

377
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,190
On your way, did you happen to notice a great many soldiers

378
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,392
moving in the hills?

379
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,893
A bit to the east, they'd have been.

380
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,194
-I did, my lord.

381
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,296
I thought to challenge them, but I went the

382
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,232
long way around instead.

383
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:40,999
-Haha.

384
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,534
Just as well.

385
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,703
Those are the armies of five kings who have all sworn to

386
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,071
destroy Camelot.

387
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,707
They say we're stirring up the peasants, giving them ideas.

388
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,243
-Ideas are dangerous things, my lord.

389
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,312
Far more dangerous than dragons or giants.

390
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,814
-I'm counting on you.

391
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,256
NARRATOR: Arthur built a round table from where Camelot could

392
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,992
be ruled, where all the knights were equal.

393
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:29,715
-So here we are, Camelot, and you are now knights of this

394
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,916
round table.

395
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,719
All will know you by your golden swords of justice.

396
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,454
Might for right!

397
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,989
TOGETHER: Might for right!

398
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,524
Might for right!

399
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:47,566
-We gathered here, who speak for the people of this land

400
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,169
choose to make you our king.

401
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,139
-Long live King Arthur!

402
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,142
TOGETHER: Long live King Arthur!

403
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,511
Long live King Arthur!

404
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,113
Long Live King Arthur!

405
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,137
-Merlin!

406
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,072
-Ha ha ha.

407
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,840
Arthur, my son.

408
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,741
You are doing well.

409
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,376
Very well.

410
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,879
I have come to tell you one thing.

411
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,881
Your knights are right.

412
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,116
King Arthur needs a queen.

413
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,086
But things are not always as they seem.

414
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,524
Be aware and face the truth, even if it is not pleasant.

415
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,731
-And if any here now can show cause why this man and this

416
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:57,135
woman should not be joined in holy matrimony, let him speak

417
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,704
now or forever hold his peace.

418
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,309
Then in the eyes of God and of this company, I pronounce that

419
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,911
they are man and wife.

420
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,449
You are now my queen.

421
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,686
-I am forever in your service.

422
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,721
TOGETHER: Long live King Arthur!

423
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,063
-It does get a bit damp and chilly in the winter, no

424
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,064
denying that.

425
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,299
-And the plumbing, my lady.

426
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,200
The plumbing.

427
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,134
-I know, Lynette.

428
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,302
Believe me, I know.

429
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,270
But Palamedes is working on that. and

430
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,672
besides, isn't it exciting?

431
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,241
Isn't it an adventure to be here right now?

432
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,642
Here, where something wonderful is happening.

433
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,244
It's never happened before.

434
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,745
-Why yes, my lady.

435
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,049
Uh, what would that be, exactly, my lady?

436
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,361
TOGETHER (SINGING): As the men of Camelot, we

437
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,331
fight for what is right.

438
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,300
We live for Camelot!

439
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,303
Banish evil with our might!

440
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,875
We have vanquished every villain, slain dragons in

441
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,243
their lairs.

442
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,212
We have courted every danger.

443
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,949
We have rescued damsels fair!

444
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:23,555
And together we have struggled, together we have

445
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:27,158
fought for the glory and the honor--

446
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,159
Fight for right!

447
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,161
Of Camelot!

448
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,765
Of Camelot!

449
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,533
Camelot!

450
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:39,137
The fairest name in all the land.

451
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,139
Camelot!

452
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:45,143
Our king is brave, and bold, and grand.

453
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,145
Camelot!

454
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,916
The silver moon is always full.

455
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:55,720
The sun shines golden every day On Camelot.

456
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,088
Camelot.

457
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,090
Camelot.

458
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,492
Camelot.

459
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:19,477
As the men of Camelot, we know what honor means.

460
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,448
We are not afraid of death.

461
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,051
We live to find our dreams.

462
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,054
We draw our swords for justice.

463
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,456
We never know defeat.

464
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:39,030
We charge toward every battle, face any challenge we meet.

465
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,833
And together we have struggled.

466
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:47,038
Together we have fought for the glory and

467
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,642
the honor of Camelot!

468
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:54,045
Of Camelot!

469
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,014
Camelot!

470
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,584
The fairest name in all the land.

471
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,386
Camelot!

472
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,590
Our king is brave, and bold, and grand.

473
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,392
Camelot!

474
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,795
The silver moon is always full.

475
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:16,001
The sun shines golden every day on Camelot.

476
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,602
Camelot.

477
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,604
Camelot.

478
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,772
Camelot.

479
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,576
Camelot.

480
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,977
Camelot.

481
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,979
Camelot.

482
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,347
Camelot.

483
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,068
-Arthur, I'm concerned about the serious weather coming in.

484
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,605
The crops will be hurt, and the May festival cancelled.

485
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,474
-Of course, my dear, but can't we discuss that later?

486
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,010
We have some rather serious business to deal with.

487
00:27:59,044 --> 00:27:59,811
-But--

488
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,545
-Later, Gwen.

489
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,579
Later.

490
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,247
Very well.

491
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,681
That takes care of that.

492
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,850
Now, about that giant eating children on [inaudible].

493
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,860
-My lady.

494
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,728
-Lancelot.

495
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,996
-This is not right.

496
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,097
-Talk to me, Lancelot.

497
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,899
Arthur is so busy.

498
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,100
I have no one to talk to.

499
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,408
ARTHUR (OFFSCREEN): The trouble is

500
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,643
that we won, Lancelot.

501
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,344
We've killed off the ogres and whatnot.

502
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,780
We've freed every serf we could reach.

503
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,750
We set up law courts, and shelters, and free kitchens

504
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,151
all over the realm.

505
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,954
We've defeated every army the barons could send against us.

506
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,289
-Why is that a trouble?

507
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,024
My friend, I don't understand.

508
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,991
It is what we wanted.

509
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,226
-It's peace, Lancelot.

510
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,195
It really is peace at last.

511
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,464
And for warriors, peace is boring.

512
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,866
I'm going to find a substitute for war.

513
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,404
-What are you thinking?

514
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,607
You're always sad in the spring, do you know it?

515
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,307
Why is that?

516
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,876
-That is when we met.

517
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,911
Guinevere, that's always when I start thinking about how it

518
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,112
could have been if--

519
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,581
-If only.

520
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,682
-Gwen.

521
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,317
What harm would it do if I talked to him?

522
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,521
I mean, he's known for 20 years how much I love you.

523
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,890
Sometimes I think everyone knows.

524
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,790
-No.

525
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,992
Everybody does not know.

526
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,860
If anyone but Arthur knew, they would have to do

527
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,196
something about it.

528
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,864
Maybe he feels it's only justice, you and

529
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,099
I having each other.

530
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,235
After all, he's got Camelot and his

531
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,838
eternal love for Morgause.

532
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,605
-Merlin.

533
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,806
Vivian!

534
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,477
I've done what you wanted.

535
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,879
I've put the fires out.

536
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:15,713
May I--

537
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,814
May I come home now?

538
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,097
-I hate these royal visits.

539
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,899
We never have a moment together.

540
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,069
-But Sir Maleagant has been so faithful to Arthur.

541
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,672
And he's such an admirer of yours.

542
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,773
-Hmph.

543
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,609
-Welcome, welcome all to castle Maleagant.

544
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:48,079
I hope you all consider this your home away from home for

545
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,581
the length of your stay.

546
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,785
Well now, cup of tea all round?

547
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,086
-Funny, nice little man.

548
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,689
He's so proud to have Arthur here.

549
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,023
-I know.

550
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,993
He wore me out, drinking to the health of the Round Table.

551
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,994
Oh Gwen.

552
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,830
If we could but be together.

553
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:09,734
[yawning]

554
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,738
-Well, Nelly, it's been a bit of a day, hasn't it?

555
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,139
Here!

556
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,774
I see you's.

557
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,643
I see you's!

558
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,578
A good woman, I thought she was.

559
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,814
A faithful wife I thought, she was.

560
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:23,681
The shame of it.

561
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,551
In my house!

562
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,786
-It is not what it appears.

563
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,487
-I--

564
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,622
I won't say anything.

565
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,055
I swear.

566
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:31,789
Never!

567
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,224
-Maleagant.

568
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,626
I am so sorry.

569
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,163
-Stop where you are, Sir Lancelot.

570
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,899
Put up your sword!

571
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:44,736
Put up your sword.

572
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,370
Maleagant.

573
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,472
You are dreaming.

574
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,574
You've been walking in your sleep.

575
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,343
Go back to your bed now, and remember nothing of

576
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,311
this when you wake.

577
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,913
It was all a dream.

578
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:56,648
-Dream.

579
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,849
All a dream.

580
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,851
-Whoever you are, I thank you with all my heart.

581
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,486
I never wishes to kill him.

582
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,688
-I did not do this for you.

583
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,324
Not for her.

584
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,993
I did this for Arthur, and no one else.

585
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,461
Go back to Camelot, you.

586
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,598
And if you cannot be faithful to him, try to be kind.

587
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:26,110
ANNOUNCER: Sir Mordred of Avalon!

588
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,445
-Avalon.

589
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,646
-Greetings, father.

590
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,380
-Morgause.

591
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,015
-My mother sends her love.

592
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:31,983
-I never knew!

593
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,384
You look so like her.

594
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,353
-She always says I have your eyes.

595
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,854
-Why didn't she--

596
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,089
She never told me.

597
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:38,956
Never.

598
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,957
Mother is of Avalon.

599
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:40,825
You weren't.

600
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,093
Not anymore.

601
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,529
And Uncle Merlin told us over and over that you had a

602
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,098
destiny to fulfill, and that I wasn't to look for

603
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,299
you until I was grown.

604
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,268
Well, I'm grown, Father.

605
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,502
-So you are.

606
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,671
Welcome to Camelot, Mordred, my son.

607
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,885
-I do wish Arthur weren't away so much these days.

608
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,921
All that galloping around and sleeping out

609
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,356
can't be good for him.

610
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,191
He's not as young as he was.

611
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,026
-Well, you know why it is.

612
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,094
-It's us, isn't it?

613
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,762
After all these years, finally.

614
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,298
He can't bear to see us together.

615
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,299
-No, Gwen.

616
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,266
It's Mordred.

617
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,035
It's Mordred seeing us.

618
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,003
That's what he cannot bear.

619
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,212
-How do I know if poets should have to be members of the

620
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,747
musician's guild?

621
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,083
How do I know if butchers should wash their hands?

622
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,118
-Father.

623
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,285
Have you a moment for me?

624
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,387
-Of course I do, Mordred.

625
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,654
Come, sit down.

626
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,390
-I dreamed of this, you know.

627
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,824
Back on Avalon.

628
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,659
I dreamed so often of the Round Table and the great

629
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,328
knights, each with his own chair.

630
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,198
I always imagined having a chair with my name on it.

631
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:54,799
-Yes.

632
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:55,433
Yes!

633
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,434
It shall be yours.

634
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,069
-Father, I never meant that.

635
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,105
But I am your son, and I am your knight, and I wish so

636
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,940
much to serve you in both ways.

637
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,978
Will you believe what I feel I have to tell you?

638
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,047
-You are my son, and my knight.

639
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,582
Say what you must.

640
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,619
-Father, does it not seem to you that Sir Lancelot and the

641
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,922
queen are too often together?

642
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,190
-Get out, Mordred.

643
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,124
-Father?

644
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,592
-Guinevere is my wife.

645
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,530
Lancelot is my best friend the best man in this court!

646
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,598
Get out, before I forget who you are.

647
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,800
Get out!

648
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,723
-Hello, Arthur.

649
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,758
-Merlin.

650
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,592
Merlin.

651
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,593
Merlin!

652
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,594
Merlin!

653
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,328
-Yes, yes.

654
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,830
We're all here.

655
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,264
Handsome couple.

656
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:00,865
-I love them, Merlin.

657
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,899
I--

658
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,568
I know I shouldn't, but I do.

659
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,669
-Hm.

660
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:09,006
Your boy's never going to understand that.

661
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,778
He wants your love more, and he wants you to be honest.

662
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,145
-I know.

663
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,046
It--

664
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,013
It's not fair, Merlin.

665
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,648
-Be careful of him, Arthur.

666
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,318
Love isn't fair, and it can do terrible things.

667
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,061
NARRATOR: Lancelot and Guinevere tried to stay apart.

668
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,330
Arthur tried to stay home more.

669
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,765
But there was no stopping the talk.

670
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,033
Not now.

671
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,535
MAN (OFFSCREEN): 20 years of it.

672
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,003
WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): All that jabber about justice, and

673
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,539
honor, and decency, and right here, right in Camelot.

674
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,840
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Breaks your heart for the

675
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,908
hold fool, don't it?

676
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,243
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Never trusted the woman.

677
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,544
WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Lancelot?

678
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,446
-What you are telling me i--is that you want to

679
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,881
set a trap for them?

680
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,184
And you have no shame about spying on them?

681
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,952
No shame to be listening at their doors?

682
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,422
-Father, if any should feel shame, it is those two.

683
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,124
They have disgraced Camelot, dishonored your

684
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,293
name before the world!

685
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,063
-Draw it unjustly and it will turn to dust.

686
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,799
-You have always said that the justice of Camelot must be for

687
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,935
every one alike or it is for no one.

688
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:15,406
Peasants, great lords, knights, yes, even queens.

689
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,942
But if she is found guilty of treason against the

690
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,477
king, she must hang.

691
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,113
-Camelot, Father, is built on truth!

692
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:22,980
-So be it.

693
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,283
Heaven help us all.

694
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,219
[humming]

695
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,154
-Come on out, Sir Lancelot!

696
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,489
MAN (OFFCREEN): Show yourself!

697
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,025
Come out, Lancelot!

698
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,459
Come out to us!

699
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,763
Come out, Lancelot!

700
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,698
-Lancelot, you can't.

701
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,866
They'll kill you.

702
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,100
It's me they want.

703
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,535
-Well, it's me they'll get.

704
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,972
Gwen, where's that thing you use to open the letters?

705
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,307
-Ah, there it is.

706
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,376
-Mordred, if I come out, will you swear to

707
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,045
let Lancelot go free?

708
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,814
-You'll come out anyway, my lady, and you will both go

709
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,216
straight before the king.

710
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,151
We are here on his authority.

711
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,118
-Lancelot, no.

712
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,753
Lancelot, I won't let you.

713
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,590
-Gwen, this is the only things I was ever good at in my life.

714
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,359
Hand me that stool over there.

715
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,327
Open the door now.

716
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,428
Stand well back.

717
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,029
It will be all right, Gwen.

718
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,772
Fair enough.

719
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,086
-Lancelot!

720
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,290
-Go, quickly!

721
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,859
I'll give you the best start I can.

722
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,461
-Arthur, it isn't--

723
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,662
-Go!

724
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:48,399
Sorry.

725
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,635
I'm so sorry.

726
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:55,206
I should never have let you challenge him.

727
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,509
-Lancelot didn't kill them, father.

728
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,710
You did.

729
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,156
-Well, I say he'll be making his own way for his own

730
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,091
castle, the joyous guard.

731
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,726
It's the only place he could take her.

732
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,495
-Then that's why you'll have to go after him.

733
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,030
He'll never come out to fight you.

734
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,731
-I will not fight with Lancelot.

735
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,200
There has been enough misery already!

736
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,802
Enough tragedy!

737
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,338
-And is he, then, to get away with shaming the round table?

738
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,073
With killing a dozen of its bravest knights

739
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,574
with his own hands?

740
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,244
How many more have turned traitor and run off to join

741
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,011
him and his rebellion?

742
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:34,712
Gareth?

743
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,846
Guinevere?

744
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,914
Palamedes?

745
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,949
-It's not a rebellion, Mordred!

746
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,253
-Is it not, when the peasants turn out to aid him, to

747
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,388
shelter him from the king's troops.

748
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,358
Father, this country cannot have two kings.

749
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,727
If you want to preserve what you have spent your life

750
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,397
building up, then you must crush Lancelot now!

751
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,007
GUINEVERE (OFFSCREEN): Once I'm out of the way, Mordred

752
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,077
won't have an excuse to keep pushing Arthur after you.

753
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,345
It will be over, Lancelot.

754
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,680
-He's here.

755
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,182
-Oh, Lancelot.

756
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,116
I'm--

757
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,185
I'm happy to see you.

758
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:14,885
Come in.

759
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:15,586
Sit down.

760
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,854
Mordred--

761
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,190
Mordred's made it all a matter of the honor of Camelot.

762
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,158
He'll never let it rest until--

763
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,827
-I will enter a monastery.

764
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,627
-I know.

765
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,796
-I will never see her again.

766
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,064
-Yes, and-- and I--

767
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,534
I will never see either of you again.

768
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,337
Well, I'll announce all this in the-- in the morning.

769
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,706
We'll sign a treaty, and that should--

770
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,374
that should--

771
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,341
-It won't help, Arthur.

772
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,377
Nothing will help.

773
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,278
I know this deep down.

774
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,780
Mordred wants to defend your honor.

775
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,615
He believes he is doing the right thing.

776
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,952
And in the end, we will have no choice.

777
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,520
-Why does he hate you so?

778
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,957
-Because however we betrayed you in our hearts-- and we

779
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,724
did, Arthur.

780
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,793
I am so sorry.

781
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,494
And he's right.

782
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,928
There is no forgiveness.

783
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,731
However we betrayed you, he will never replace us.

784
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,566
Never catch up with all those years the

785
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,769
three of us had together.

786
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,270
Not unless we are gone.

787
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,105
Not even then.

788
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,673
-After tomorrow?

789
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,309
-After tomorrow, we'll speak again, right here, you and I.

790
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,545
-If we don't, if something happens?

791
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,314
-Why, then, we'll talk somewhere else.

792
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,351
-Farewell, my king.

793
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,952
-Farewell, my friend.

794
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,354
My Lancelot.

795
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,125
-Hello, Hawk.

796
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,894
Hello, Arthur.

797
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,528
-Merlin.

798
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:30,961
Merlin!

799
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:31,862
Merlin!

800
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,097
I'm so glad to see you.

801
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,864
Yes.

802
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:34,899
Yes, you too!

803
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,233
-I should have warned you about

804
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,302
rescuing people from dragons.

805
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,737
I meant to get to that.

806
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,406
-I don't blame Guinevere and Lancelot for anything.

807
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,341
I don't even blame Mordred.

808
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,843
I am the one who lost Camelot.

809
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:46,677
-Nonsense.

810
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,612
You are the one who built it.

811
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,448
No one else could have done that.

812
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,982
The Lancelots can't build.

813
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,517
They can only defend.

814
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,687
And the Mordreds have good intentions, but cannot see the

815
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,955
bigger picture.

816
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,023
You did your job.

817
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,025
-But Camelot is gone, Merlin.

818
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:01,926
Gone forever.

819
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,060
It will never return.

820
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,062
-Have I taught you nothing then?

821
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,899
Because of you, now there is a Camelot to remember, a Camelot

822
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,603
to dream about, a Camelot to rebuild and rebuild over and

823
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,406
over, and every time to come.

824
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,576
And it will fall again each time, and return again.

825
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:23,614
Only Avalon is forever, and you are part of Avalon.

826
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,950
-Tell me that again, Merlin.

827
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,252
Say that just once more.

828
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,222
-You are a part of Avalon.

829
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,290
You are one with Avalon.

830
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,825
Always, Arthur.

831
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:35,693
Always.

832
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,660
-They won't fight.

833
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,294
Mark my words.

834
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,796
They won't fight.

835
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,565
-The king will do anything rather than fight Lancelot.

836
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,133
-Well, I should think so.

837
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,003
He'll watch them walk off scot free and never lift a finger

838
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,371
to defend his own name.

839
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,973
-They will not go free.

840
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,274
That will not happen.

841
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,375
I promise you.

842
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,410
-Why should he listen to you?

843
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,747
-Because I speak the truth, and one day he will thank me

844
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,882
for speaking truth.

845
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,918
One day he will bless me for saving his honor!

846
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,520
TOGETHER: Hooray!

847
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,955
-That's the way to talk, boy.

848
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,359
Just remember tomorrow when the old man needs you.

849
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,760
TOGETHER: Hooray!

850
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,804
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): I rise to this day.

851
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,408
I rise to this hour.

852
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:31,081
Called by a silent, irresistible power.

853
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,918
For this, I was born.

854
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,854
For this, I was raised.

855
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:42,359
I must carry the light so the truth might be saved.

856
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:52,303
I rush like the wind, I will charge toward my fate.

857
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:58,976
Fear wins the day if I dare hesitate.

858
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:06,016
I must reach for the hand that's reaching for me.

859
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,419
I am the companion of destiny.

860
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:19,563
I will fight endless nights, I will ride with the sun, 'til

861
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:22,566
evil is banished and honor is won!

862
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,505
Dragons will fall, our banners will fly.

863
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:33,077
Justice will reign, and peace will rise!

864
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,653
On a glorious quest for eternal dawn.

865
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:46,357
I sail on the dreams of Avalon.

866
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:02,640
Called to this quest, my vision is clear.

867
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:11,448
I fight for the right to live without fear, to heal every

868
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,753
heart, to free every soul.

869
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:19,056
Let the journey begin.

870
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,625
Let the story be told!

871
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:36,006
-For my part, I will sign this treaty with a glad heart, and

872
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,342
without any reservation.

873
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,978
-What now, king's boy?

874
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,312
-It's your time, laddie.

875
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,314
Speak now, or Lancelot wins it all.

876
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,349
-I will sign.

877
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,551
I will pledge my word.

878
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,685
MORDRED (OFFSCREEN): And what is the word of such a

879
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,087
scoundrel worth?

880
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,788
-Mordred.

881
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:51,755
Be silent!

882
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,024
-No, father, I will not be silent.

883
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:57,594
You pledged your word before to be my father's faithful

884
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,064
knight, and instead you betrayed him

885
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,132
every day for 20 years!

886
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,634
-Mordred!

887
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,837
-And then led a traitorous rebellion against him.

888
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,008
I ask you, sir Lancelot, why should he trust you now?

889
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,377
Why should anyone trust you now?

890
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,879
Except, of course, the queen.

891
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,315
-No!

892
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,085
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): Just like the wind, I will

893
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,621
charge toward my fate.

894
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:31,095
Fear wins the day if I dare hesitate.

895
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,131
I must reach for the hand--

896
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,432
-Arthur!

897
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,267
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): --that's reaching for me.

898
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,702
-Arthur!

899
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,437
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): I am the companion of destiny.

900
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:52,049
I will fight endless nights, I will ride with the sun 'til

901
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,252
evil is banished and honor is won!

902
00:45:55,285 --> 00:46:00,557
Dragons will fall, our banners will fly!

903
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:06,096
Justice will reign and peace will rise!

904
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,498
-Arthur!

905
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,300
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): On a glorious quest--

906
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,568
MORDRED (OFFSCREEN): Father!

907
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,603
SINGER (OFFSCREEN): --for eternal dawn.

908
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,342
I sail on the dreams of Avalon.

909
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,209
-Mordred.

910
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,677
Peace, my son.

911
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,514
Carry the peace of Camelot forward.

912
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,404
-Time to come home, Arthur.

913
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:48,705
-You rode bravely, Arthur.

914
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,575
A long, hard ride on a difficult mount.

915
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,943
-Avalon.

916
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,978
NARRATOR: He always thought there were wiser men than he,

917
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,647
but there were none.

918
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,850
He never drew his sword unjustly, and he brought it

919
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,952
home as it was given to him.

920
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:06,023
He gave everyone he touched a hope of a world at peace

921
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,424
beyond all fear.

922
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,574
He never gave up on people.

923
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:32,082
That's why he waits still on Avalon, to return when his

924
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,485
time comes again.

925
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,422
That's why he lives forever.

926

[music playing]

927
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,509
TOGETHER: As the men of Camelot, we

928
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,912
fight for what is right.

929
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:07,451
We live for Camelot banish evil with our might.

930
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:12,656
We have vanquished every villain, slain dragons in

931
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,991
their lairs.

932
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:20,897
We have courted every danger, we have rescued damsels fair!

933
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:25,502

As the men of Camelot, we know what honor means.

We are not afraid of death.

We live to find our dreams.

949
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:34,071
We draw our swords for justice, we never know defeat.

950
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:41,678
We charge toward every battle, face any challenge we meet.

951
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,648
And together we have struggled.

952
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:48,752
Together we have fought for the glory and

953
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,854
the honor of Camelot.

954
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,593
Of Camelot!

955
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,261
Camelot!
