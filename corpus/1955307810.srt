1
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,383
<i>Anyway...</i>

2
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,952
<i>Today I went across the street
to the apple store,</i>

3
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,788
<i>and I got one of the new
iPhones with the 64-gigabytes,</i>

4
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,258
<i>'cause I wasn't sure if I
should get the 16s or the 64s,</i>

5
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,994
<i>but the 64s look good,
so there you go.</i>

6
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,231
<i>The genius bartender showed me
how to make things bigger,</i>

7
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,532
<i>but I already forgot.</i>

8
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,668
<i>God, my eyesight is so shot.</i>

9
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,404
<i>But I got on Google before,
and I looked up my apartment,</i>

10
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,573
<i>and it said they'd filmed</i> the
hills<i> there for two seasons.</i>

11
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,008
<i>Isn't that neat?</i>

12
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,013
<i>And they used to do the</i> extra <i>program at
the grove every day with Mario Lopez.</i>

13
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,615
<i>He seems nice.</i>

14
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,384
<i>And who wouldn't love
an outdoor mall?</i>

15
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,654
<i>I can't believe it,
me in Los Angeles.</i>

16
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,723
<i>If only daddy could see me now.</i>

17
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,160
<i>Today they played
"come fly with me,"</i>

18
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,629
<i>and I almost started crying,
thinking about him.</i>

19
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,465
<i>But I didn't 'cause,
basically, I feel great.</i>

20
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,934
<i>It's like living on main street
in Disneyland.</i>

21
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,337
<i>Every day is sunny,
and I wake up and I think,</i>

22
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,039
<i>"thank you, Joey,
for making it possible."</i>

23
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:25,544
<i>I swear, if I get hit by
that trolley, I'll die happy.</i>

24
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,479
<i>Just wait till you see
my apartment.</i>

25
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,719
<i>I have a balcony that's far enough
away from other people's balconies,</i>

26
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,755
<i>so nobody could jump down
from the roof or whatever.</i>

27
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,391
<i>And I have a parking spot
next to the elevator,</i>

28
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,728
<i>so I can just run
right in there.</i>

29
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,130
<i>And I got everything shipped
out from Jersey,</i>

30
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,465
<i>all my artwork,</i>

31
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,467
<i>the doll I had made of you,</i>

32
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,837
<i>and, of course, the pictures of
me and daddy in his red car.</i>

33
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,273
<i>God, we had the best times
in that thing.</i>

34
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,708
Anyway, call me back. Love you.

35
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,832
Oh, god...

36
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,005
I brought you bagels.

37
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,140
You should have called.

38
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,141
I did.

39
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,409
But I didn't answer.

40
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,211
Oh, I figured you were working
or something.

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,147
Say hi to your grand-dogs.

42
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,883
Hi, doggies. How you doing?

43
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,952
Okay. Stay there.

44
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,553
All right, bye.

45
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,189
Six bagels, all salt.

46
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,891
Those are the best kind.

47
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,962
Oh, Lor, you let
daddy's bonsai die.

48
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,431
Oh, yeah. Sorry, ma.

49
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,235
I tried, but they're, like,
crazy delicate.

50
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,070
It was crazy.

51
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,471
Sorry, Joey.

52
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:03,508
See, this is why I asked you
not to put me in charge.

53
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,245
You can't just leave someone
with a bonsai and orchid

54
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,579
and put all this pressure
on them.

55
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,214
You let the orchid die, too?

56
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,916
I watered it every day.

57
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,652
Well, Lori, you're not supposed
to water it every day.

58
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,887
Well, I watered it the right
amount, okay?

59
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,890
Please, don't make me
feel any more bad about it.

60
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,425
Okay, forget it.

61
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,763
Oh, what's this?

62
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,366
It's Emily's baby shower.

63
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,601
Do you get to bring somebody?

64
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,069
Why? I probably won't go.

65
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,337
Why not?

66
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,339
Because I'll have to get
all dressed up,

67
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,108
and everyone I know
will be there.

68
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,712
I thought you gave up smoking.

69
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,914
Cigarettes.
You said this was better.

70
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,817
I said it was okay after your
father died when your stomach hurt.

71
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,954
Well, it's after my father died,
and my stomach hurts.

72
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,692
Well, have you heard from Jacob?

73
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,761
You shouldn't call him.

74
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,963
What's going on at work? Did
they call you about the pilot?

75
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,665
You shouldn't be smoking
if you have a deadline.

76
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,466
Mom, don't say "deadline."

77
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,934
Don't say "pilot,"

78
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,071
and please don't ever
say the word "Jacob" again.

79
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,773
Okay.

80
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,078
I just think you
shouldn't call him.

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,282
Especially if you have a deadline for
your pilot. Jacob... I mean, I just...

82
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,884
I think we should get you
a hobby.

83
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,520
I thought you were gonna
volunteer at the hospital.

84
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:25,324
Yeah, I've been meaning
to do that.

85
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,492
Or maybe you could be my hobby?

86
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,099
And then, you just touch
the screen like that.

87
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,902
Look how you magnified that.
That's gre...

88
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,339
Okay, say you wanna find
an address for a baby shower.

89
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,541
Well, then you just
open safari here,

90
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,009
and then you type it in.
Or Google it.

91
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,944
Yeah, you Google it,
and if you ever need it again,

92
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,446
it's right there in your
search history.

93
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,648
Oh, my god. Freddy,
you are a genius.

94
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,116
It's just a label.

95
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,317
My daughter's a genius,

96
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,652
but she's too old for you.

97
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,954
How old are you?
I'll be 23 in October.

98
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,558
Get out of here. October...
That makes you a Libra, right?

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,329
So scales, justice...
You're probably very diplomatic.

100
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,664
You should be a lawyer.

101
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,200
Maybe.

102
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,669
You should be.
You should.

103
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,838
Oh, my god.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,073
No, no, no. I'm not even
a candidate for Lasik.

105
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,977
They said they had to slice my eyeball
open and put in a little... a lens.

106
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,912
Well, you should get
what I have. Transitions.

107
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,982
They go from regular glasses to
sunglasses when you walk outside.

108
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,017
And you can get them anywhere.
Lenscrafters.

109
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,486
Want me to make you
an appointment?

110
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:30,122
You should try Zillow.

111
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:33,525
They have a lot of places to
rent and... or just get advice.

112
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,694
I mean, that's how I found
my condo.

113
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,895
Zillow.

114
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,132
What you have to do is have him
tip you upside down.

115
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:43,535
That's what Joe and I did
to conceive Lori.

116
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,771
It'll be easy. She's so petite.
Yeah.

117
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,273
Oh...

118
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,209
It's another pink bunny!

119
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,346
I love it. What's next?

120
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:58,083
Ooh...
Is this a baby monitor?

121
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,119
It's from Mrs. Minervini.

122
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,521
What is it?

123
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:06,191
Oh, my god.

124
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,193
It's an iPad.

125
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,661
What? What?

126
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,963
Wow. Oh, my god.
Marnie.

127
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,999
This is crazy generous.

128
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,067
Well, I know it wasn't
on your list. No.

129
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,103
But, I was in the apple store
the other day,

130
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,440
and I saw this little Filipino
boy, practically a baby,

131
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,208
and he was playing
with one of these...

132
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,810
I mean, what do you...
iPad.

133
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,845
IPad, yes.
And then Freddy came over,

134
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,582
and he told me
that you can load in programs...

135
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:34,019
Like Nemo and Barney's circus...

136
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,253
Brilliant.
Yes.

137
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,757
Brilliant. Marnie, thank you.
This is so nice.

138
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,859
Lori has the best mum ever.

139
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,929
Apart from my mum.
Did you get that down?

140
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,497
I'm gonna write it down.
Write it down. Yeah.

141
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,699
Hey, where is Lori?

142
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,169
I think she's working.
She had a deadline.

143
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,737
I mean, a countdown.

144
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,807
Yeah, she said she'd watch
Tehya for me tonight.

145
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,976
Dani and I haven't been able
to get out in, like, a year.

146
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,612
Oh, I could do it.
I thought she was out of town.

147
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:01,813
She told me she was sick.

148
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,815
Well, she was sick.
She was.

149
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,852
I'd be sick too with everything
Jacob puts her through.

150
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,588
She's so pretty.
Why can't she just get over him?

151
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,890
Well, he was the last person
to meet her dad.

152
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,626
Oh, yeah, he really loved her dad.
That's tough to get over.

153
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,463
She's not gonna get over him if she
keeps giving him what he wants.

154
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,498
What does he want?

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,535
Oh, my god!

156
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,070
I'm dying.

157
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,905
What does he want?

158
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,740
It wasn't on the list either.

159
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,143
Marnie? Marnie?

160
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,012
This is Greg's dad.

161
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,348
He came out to help us
with the nursery.

162
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,017
Marnie.
Hi. Mark.

163
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,221
He's in town till Thursday, so...
Yeah.

164
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,859
She's a character, huh?

165
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,894
Well...

166
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,930
So you came out, um,
to see your son?

167
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,799
Yeah, Emily said it was
very important that I come,

168
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,235
but I think I'm just here
to carry gifts.

169
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,837
Hmm.

170
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,506
Yeah. Well, his mother's
not around anymore, so...

171
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,542
My husband died a year ago.

172
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,443
Oh, she's alive.
She lives in London.

173
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,012
But, you know, we're divorced.

174
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:07,846
Oh, sorry.

175
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,215
Eh...

176
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,517
Emily tells me you grew up
in Brooklyn?

177
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,286
Yeah.
Which... which part?

178
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,288
Sunset park.

179
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:21,560
I grew up on the corner of 48th and
7th Avenue, right by the church.

180
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,161
Get outta here.
Yeah.

181
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:27,165
I grew up at 43rd and 4th,
by the other church.

182
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,301
Yeah. We used to go
to the public pool there,

183
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,669
before it became a parking lot.

184
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,838
Get out of here,
I went there all the time!

185
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,341
I'll bet we moved
in similar circles.

186
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,477
Oh, absolutely.
That's crazy.

187
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,112
Yeah, yeah.
That's funny.

188
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,782
Hey, you know,
before I leave town,

189
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,718
we should go have lunch,
you know, with the girls.

190
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,823
Or, there's this holocaust museum I've
been really wanting to check out.

191
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,692
Have you been
to the holocaust museum?

192
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,828
No. It sounds like fun,
but I can't.

193
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,164
I really can't because
I've just moved in, you know.

194
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,567
I've got all my paperwork
I gotta do, and, you know...

195
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,903
Plus, I'm volunteering
at the hospital,

196
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,671
and I might also be babysitting.

197
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,408
I'm not sure, but it looks like
pretty soon I might be babysitting.

198
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,745
But I've never been so busy.

199
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,681
Okay, so I'm just calling

200
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,051
to tell you that I'm on my way
to the hospital to volunteer.

201
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,887
And so, call me back and, soon,

202
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,590
because once I get in there,
then, I mean, I'll be in there

203
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,359
and you won't be able to reach
me. So...

204
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,261
Oh, and did I tell you
about this new Beyoncé song?

205
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,296
Listen to this.

206
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,836
Yeah? Right? So, anyway, yeah.

207
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,105
So call me soon
because once I get in there,

208
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,641
then you won't be able
to reach me. Okay.

209
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,110
So, bye. Call me.

210
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,963
<i>Discovered in the Angeles
national forest</i>

211
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,966
<i>within 10 miles of where the
skeletal remains were found.</i>

212
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:11,770
<i>Police suspect this could be the work of
a serial killer that's been targeting</i>

213
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,305
<i>young women in the area
since 2005.</i>

214
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,508
<i>Well, we've got dangerous
riptides in Malibu.</i>

215
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,877
<i>What do you need to know if you're
headed to the beach this weekend?</i>

216
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,412
<i>Well, it may be sunny...</i>

217
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,015
Lor?

218
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,583
Lori?

219
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,353
Don't you bring your mail in
anymore?

220
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,290
Lor.

221
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,425
Lori?

222
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,908
You're not bringing the mail in?

223
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,831
Jesus.

224
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,734
Mom! You have to ring
the doorbell.

225
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,868
But I've got the key.

226
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,570
Well, what if I had company?

227
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,139
You mean like Jacob?

228
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,140
Who told you that?

229
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,909
Your friends at the baby shower.

230
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,081
Mom, please don't talk
to my friends, okay?

231
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,518
And you're not supposed to go as a "plus
one" if there isn't a one to plus.

232
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,354
But you never told me
if you were going or not.

233
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,191
Oh, did you get my message
about the serial killer?

234
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,395
The guy that's going all around Southern
California targeting young women?

235
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,464
Well, we should be fine, then.

236
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,467
Well, I was thinking that we
should get a system in place where

237
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,169
every time you're leaving
the house, you call me,

238
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,805
and then you text me
when you're home.

239
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,540
That's crazy.

240
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,244
Well, I just mean until, you
know, until they catch the guy.

241
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,147
And if you run into him, you
know what you're supposed to do.

242
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,351
It's, like, eyes,
throat, crotch.

243
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,153
Crotch.

244
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,757
Mom, maybe you shouldn't drop
around here all the time.

245
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,892
But I barely see you anymore.

246
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:45,396
Well, you know,
I've got a ton of work to do,

247
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:49,934
so, you know,
it requires a lot of research.

248
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,704
I'm just saying,

249
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:56,908
I'm not in the position to be
very entertaining right now.

250
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,309
I don't have any good stories.

251
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,478
Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

252
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,383
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

253
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,487
What I need right now
is to write.

254
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,688
Okay?

255
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,324
This is my office.

256
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,425
This is my desk.

257
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,361
These are my co-workers.

258
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:20,999
If I was in a real office, you
wouldn't come in and sit on my desk

259
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,234
and pet my co-workers,
would you?

260
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,936
No?

261
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,977
I've been talking to my
therapist about this, and...

262
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,481
I think it's time that we...

263
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,516
Set some boundaries.

264
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,719
Sure.

265
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,388
Yep.

266
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,890
I get it.

267
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,625
You need to write...

268
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,861
And I need to...

269
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,430
Get out of your office.

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,667
But you don't have to leave
right now.

271
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,335
No, it's fine. It's fine.

272
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,838
I don't want to be crossing
anybody's boundaries.

273
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,711
I don't know. She seems
so angry all the time.

274
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,346
You've been seeing her
for a while.

275
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,315
Has she always seemed so angry?

276
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,921
And I just, I don't...

277
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,390
I don't want her to hurt
herself or anything.

278
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,259
I mean, does she talk
to you about that?

279
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,361
I'm not saying that I want
to know what she says.

280
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,730
I'm just saying that if she
talks to you about stuff...

281
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,031
I hope she talks to you
about that stuff

282
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,900
and that you talk to her
about that stuff,

283
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,936
and that you make sure she doesn't
hurt herself or anything.

284
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:36,307
And, you know, maybe also tell her
to stop smoking so much grass.

285
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:41,312
I know she's in... Some stage
of grief or something, but...

286
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,015
And what about you?
What about me?

287
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,850
How do you feel?

288
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,185
Well, I feel she should find

289
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,487
some other way to feel better
besides marijuana.

290
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,424
No, I mean how do you feel
since your husband died?

291
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,394
Oh.

292
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,100
Well, of course I feel sad.

293
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,205
But I don't think I'm
as stressed as Lori,

294
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,108
because I don't have to worry
about my career or money

295
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,677
because Joey, god bless him,
he set me up for life.

296
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,613
So I can do...
I can do anything.

297
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:19,384
I mean, like, when I go to an
action movie, I get three tickets,

298
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,220
one for me, one for Joe,
one for my mother.

299
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,855
And I don't even have
to think about it.

300
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,623
I don't have to worry about it.

301
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,962
I spend...

302
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,431
A lot of time by myself.

303
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,501
And, well, there are
a lot of hours in the day,

304
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,070
and so sometimes I don't know
what to do with them,

305
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,339
and I call Lori...

306
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,840
But she...

307
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,309
Well, she doesn't...

308
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,110
She doesn't want my advice
or anything.

309
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,512
I mean, I have nothing...

310
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,615
Important to say.

311
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,055
But basically, I feel great.

312
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,724
I love my apartment.

313
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,793
You can't beat this weather.

314
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,328
And who doesn't love the grove?

315
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,064
I mean, it's like living
on main street in Disneyland.

316
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,331
Anyway, call me and let me
know you got in safe.

317
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,734
Oh, and remind me to tell you
what your therapist said.

318
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,874
<i>Very little information about the
message left behind by the serial killer</i>

319
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,377
<i>who is asking to be called
the "red ripper."</i>

320
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,720
It's so good to see you
out of the house...

321
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,656
And on such a nice occasion.

322
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,964
Ah, pretzel bread!

323
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,033
Reminds me of my father...
Well, pretzels.

324
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,203
Mmm. So good.

325
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,806
So, listen, mom,

326
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,842
I have to go to New York for a
few weeks to shoot the pilot.

327
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,977
New York? Why?

328
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,380
Well, 'cause the show is set there,
so it's... it's actually good,

329
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:07,652
but I'm not gonna be reachable
for a few weeks, like, at all.

330
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:11,022
Like, somebody else is gonna be
holding my phone for me.

331
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,624
But I was thinking at the end

332
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,027
if you wanted to come
and visit the set

333
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,931
and we could finally think about

334
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,766
getting a headstone for dad,

335
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,735
or, you know, at least figure
out what to do with his ashes.

336
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,771
Yeah, well, we don't have
to talk about it now.

337
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,607
We can wait until, you know,
before you go and then...

338
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,509
I leave tomorrow.

339
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,479
Tomorrow?

340
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,814
That's really soon.
I know.

341
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,884
But maybe you could come over
tonight and help me pack,

342
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,954
and maybe even crash so you could give
me a ride to the airport tomorrow?

343
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,590
That'd be fun.
How about if I go with you?

344
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,759
If I go with you,
I could be like your assistant.

345
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,495
No, no.

346
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,030
I think, if anything,
I'd need you here,

347
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:57,568
you know, to watch the house
and look after your grand-dogs.

348
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,206
It's my job, mom.

349
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,376
Yeah, yeah. Sure, you're right.

350
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,312
You're right. It's great.
It's a good idea.

351
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,380
It's a good opportunity.

352
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,882
It is, you know.
It's good.

353
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,950
And it's really good timing
for me, you know?

354
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:17,455
I can get out of town and be busy,
and finally take my mind off things.

355
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,757
Jacob!
Exactly.

356
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,963
Excuse me, can I get a picture
with you?

357
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,965
Yeah.
Yeah?

358
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,967
Thank you so much.

359
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,637
Hey, you two.

360
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,038
Hey, you two!

361
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,973
Hi.
Hey, Marnie.

362
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,441
Jacob, it's good to see you.

363
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,410
You know, I never said
anything bad about you.

364
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,914
You know, Elise, right?
Yes.

365
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,615
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

366
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,752
Well, we don't want
to interrupt your...

367
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:48,886
Your girl time.

368
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,788
No! No, no, it's fine.

369
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,991
We're just doing a drive-by
until I go out later.

370
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:57,461
I didn't want her to have to
spend Valentine's day alone.

371
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,430
I didn't want her to spend it
alone, either.

372
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,666
I'm not alone.
No. We're together.

373
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,367
Until later,
when I'm meeting other people.

374
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,969
I thought we were having
a sleepover?

375
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,270
No.

376
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,538
That's so cute!

377
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,273
I wish my mom and I
were that close.

378
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,909
Aw... well, maybe,
when you get older.

379
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,483
What would make you happy?

380
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,352
If I could be stuffed
into a Cannon

381
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,954
and shot into outer space.

382
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,622
Should we go get milkshakes?

383
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,525
I'm going to kill myself.

384
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,327
Don't say that.
I can't live here anymore.

385
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,928
There's no safe place.

386
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,265
I mean, just when I want to hit
the eject button, you move here.

387
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,766
What does that mean?

388
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,969
It means that I tried to book
a session with my therapist

389
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,303
to talk about my mother,

390
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,739
and I couldn't
because my mother was there!

391
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,508
You told me to go talk to her
after daddy died, so...

392
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,010
Do you understand?

393
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:49,180
Eighty percent of the time
the phone rings, it's you!

394
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:53,718
The phone rings and I think it could
be a job, or a guy, or a friend,

395
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,622
and it's my mother!
Almost every single time.

396
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,925
Do you understand how terrible
that makes me feel?

397
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,061
I can call less.

398
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,463
I can. I can just...

399
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,964
Well, like if you
don't get back to me,

400
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,332
I'll just text.

401
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,071
I'm never gonna get over him.

402
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,640
How can I help?
What can I do?

403
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:16,941
Nothing.

404
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,343
Well, then who are you texting?
Don't act out.

405
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,513
I need to have sex with someone
else, and you can't be here for it.

406
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,582
Okay, but just not Jacob.

407
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,550
Please, mom,
I can't do this anymore.

408
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,853
I need to get a life
of my own, okay?

409
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,021
And so do you!

410
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,028
I still need a ride
to the airport.

411
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,468
You have everything?

412
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,970
I have no idea.

413
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,642
<i>Passengers only. No parking.</i>

414
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,611
Love you.
Love you.

415
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,949
<i>Blue team to ICU, please.
Blue team, ICU.</i>

416
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,299
Oh.

417
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,534
Hi. Hello.

418
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:58,676
You all by yourself?
Because your thing's beeping.

419
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,478
There's nobody with you?

420
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,350
I think, maybe, you got tangled.

421
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,918
Let me look.

422
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,388
I don't know.

423
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,323
The wires or something here?

424
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:17,094
Ah, there you go.
See? Is that better?

425
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,830
You seem like you...
Ah, okay.

426
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:23,267
Well, I'll go get somebody
that knows what they're doing.

427
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:28,606
Um, you can keep the little bunny.
He likes it there.

428
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,144
The woman in 317, she's in pain.

429
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,678
Oh. Mm-hm.

430
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,553
Marnie, hi!
What are you doing here?

431
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,622
You said you needed
a babysitter.

432
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,223
I brought bagels.

433
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,726
Oh, come in, please.

434
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,429
All salt.

435
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,434
You know what nobody ever tells
you is how lonely it is.

436
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,003
I swear, I feel like
there are some days

437
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,673
where I go an entire day without
seeing another grown person.

438
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,842
Like, by the time Dani
gets home,

439
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,077
I don't even know how
to shut off the baby-talk.

440
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,579
That is so normal.

441
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,281
Really?
Really.

442
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,817
But, you know, you have to
remember that she's gonna grow up.

443
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,252
She's not gonna stay
a little kid forever.

444
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,087
And then you'll be having
real conversations.

445
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,724
You'll talk about everything,
the way me and Lori do.

446
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,760
Yeah, I know...
Well, you're right, I know.

447
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:26,697
God, I don't know why I'm so worried
about, like, doing it right.

448
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,800
I... I lost my mom
when I was young,

449
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,903
so I'm... I'm flying blind.

450
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:36,273
Lori told me something about that.
I'm sorry.

451
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,677
But you can call me anytime
to babysit if you want.

452
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,415
God, Lori is so lucky to have you
so close if she ever has kids.

453
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,151
My dad couldn't even fly in
for my fake wedding.

454
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,420
You know, I had to walk myself
down the aisle.

455
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,956
Oh, why was your wedding fake?

456
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,025
Oh, because, yeah,
it was at city hall.

457
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,695
And, like, we'd just found out
the adoption was going through.

458
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:01,432
And so, you know, I convinced myself
I just wanted a quickie wedding,

459
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,901
and then I thought we'd have a
real wedding once Tehya came home,

460
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:08,105
but now it just... it feels
selfish to spend any money

461
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:11,342
I'd spend on her on, like,
giving us a special day, so...

462
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,711
But what about Dani,
is he working?

463
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,013
Oh, she.
Yeah, she's a chef at Bouchon,

464
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,783
but she's, like, fifth in line
and works crazy hours.

465
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,253
She does.
Mm.

466
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,492
What if I gave you the money?

467
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,227
What?
Yeah.

468
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,997
You know, I can gift a certain amount
of money every year to a person

469
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,499
without having to pay taxes,
and I...

470
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:39,169
I don't know if it's gonna be enough
for your dream wedding, but $13,000...

471
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,805
Marnie, that's crazy.
No. What's crazy?

472
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,743
I have it, you need it. I mean, you just
don't want to leave it sitting around.

473
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,946
Well, no. You should save it.
Spend it on yourself.

474
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:51,715
I mean, wouldn't Lori be upset?

475
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,751
Why? She's not getting married.

476
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,887
Why would you even want
to do that?

477
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:02,326
It's romantic and, you know,
renewing your vows.

478
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:07,264
Joe and I talked about that.
Who doesn't love love?

479
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:11,735
Oh, my god! Marnie!
This is amazing!

480
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,838
I mean, well, obviously, you're gonna
be involved in all of the planning.

481
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,774
Only whatever you want me
to be part of.

482
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,376
What do you think you want?
Oh, my god.

483
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,111
Nothing, like, extravagant.

484
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,815
Dani was in the Navy,
so maybe like a nautical theme.

485
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,517
You could wear
a little sailor dress and he...

486
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,851
She could wear her uniform.

487
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,955
And it would be like
<i>officer and a gentleman.</i>

488
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,626
Or you could do it
on a submarine.

489
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,695
Well, I don't see
any submarines for rent,

490
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,698
but there are a bunch of boats at
the yacht club in Marina Del Rey.

491
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,499
That you can rent for a party?

492
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,501
Yeah, looks like it.

493
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,738
Freddy, you are a genius.

494
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,275
Oh, jeez, it's $10,000
just for the venue.

495
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,811
Look at that.

496
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,080
I should get one of these
for my daughter.

497
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:58,749
Here, why don't you ring me up
another iPad?

498
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:02,252
Yeah, sure.

499
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,656
You know, I decided
to take your advice.

500
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,291
You're gonna be a lawyer?

501
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,526
Well, no.
But I am going to school.

502
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:10,995
I mean, it's night school,

503
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,465
but maybe engineering
or programming or something.

504
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,766
See how far I can get.

505
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,901
And work's gonna pay for it,
so...

506
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,137
Oh, Freddy, you took my advice.

507
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,475
Yeah, now all I have to do is figure out
my work schedule and the bus schedule.

508
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,143
You don't have a car?

509
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,045
Nah, my mom uses it for work,
but it's okay.

510
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,380
I don't mind taking a bus.

511
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:30,948
Meet a lot of freaky people
on there.

512
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,616
No, I could drive you.
When?

513
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,851
What are you talking about?

514
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,152
I'm in the neighborhood.

515
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,687
You're always
helping me out all the time.

516
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,356
This will be my chance
to pay you back.

517
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,725
Oh, my god.
Do we have to take the freeway?

518
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,128
I mean, we could avoid it,
but are you sure?

519
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,963
I mean, it's kind of late.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:49,233
No, no, I...
Don't worry about it.

521
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,801
I don't sleep much.

522
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,911
What?

523
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,279
Cut! Cut!

524
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,116
Hey, are you...
Are you supposed to be here?

525
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,285
Here? Okay.

526
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:44,421
Background, cross over, talk
to the woman in the blue hat.

527
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,023
Okay?

528
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:49,660
Yeah, killing the flowers.
Take that from you.

529
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,528
Okay, losing the sweater.

530
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,963
Losing the sweater.

531
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,065
Sorry about that.

532
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,567
Take your time, chance.

533
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,001
Okay. Great.

534
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,104
Great. All right!

535
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,740
We're gonna go again!

536
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,242
Mark.

537
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,278
All right, background!

538
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,448
Action!

539
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,884
Hi.
Shh.

540
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,286
Anyways, I was just walking...
Shh.

541
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,822
So, we do it this way...

542
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,930
Cut!

543
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,866
<i>Anyway...</i>
Background!

544
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,835
<i>The craziest thing happened.
You would not believe.</i>

545
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:36,039
<i>I wandered onto a Hollywood movie set and
ended up being a part of the action.</i>

546
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,975
<i>Isn't that wild?</i>

547
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:42,279
They say movie stars aren't nice
people, but they really are.

548
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,220
Half-day today?

549
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,294
<i>I don't think I'll go back,
but I'm glad I did it.</i>

550
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,663
<i>Then three nights a week
I take Freddy to his class,</i>

551
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:00,964
<i>and we talk the whole way.</i>

552
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,933
And they're alive
when he scalps them.

553
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,769
No way.
And then, he eats their brains.

554
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,672
Oh, no! That's sick!
I know.

555
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,407
That's sick!
I know. I know.

556
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,176
Three, two, one. <i>And I've
been having a great time</i>

557
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,744
<i>doing wedding plans
with what's-her-name.</i>

558
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:15,112
Oh, my god!

559
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,950
<i>She seems really excited
and loves all my ideas.</i>

560
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:23,353
And I know who
the flower girl is.

561
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,656
Oh, I wonder who?

562
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,858
<i>And I've been really getting into
volunteering at the hospital.</i>

563
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,727
<i>You should come down here with
me sometime and meet the staff.</i>

564
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,462
And not married.
That's so funny.

565
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,798
My daughter's
not married either.

566
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,836
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that
I'm keeping busy with all my stuff,

567
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,537
and, basically, I feel great.

568
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,141
So, give me a call, and let me
know you're safe and sound.

569
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,977
And I hope you're not thinking
about Jacob too much.

570
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,912
Love you...
Hello, is...

571
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,784
- Is that you? Hello?
- <i>Marnie, is that you?</i>

572
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,485
<i>It's Tony.</i>

573
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,922
<i>I'm here with cos and Dominic,
and we all wanted to say hi.</i>

574
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,725
- Here, talk to Dom.
<i>- Hey, Marnie, how are you?</i>

575
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,493
Hey, Dom.
How are you feeling?

576
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,596
<i>Are you coming back to Jersey
for Joe's anniversary?</i>

577
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:09,399
Yeah, sure, but maybe not
actually on the actual day.

578
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,670
I have to get settled first, and then
as soon as I feel a bit more settled,

579
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:16,406
then I'm gonna come and,
you know, I'll book a flight,

580
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,141
and then I'll come see you guys.

581
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,110
How's Ange? How's she doing?

582
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,212
<i>She's good, she's good. Yeah,
you want to talk to her? Angie!</i>

583
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,047
No, if she's busy, it's okay.

584
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,383
Don't...
<i>Marnie, where are you?</i>

585
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,851
<i>When are you coming to visit?</i>

586
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,419
Soon. I just...

587
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,022
Right now I just have
an awful lot on my plate, so...

588
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:35,726
<i>Have you thought about what kind of a
headstone you want to get for Joe?</i>

589
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,796
<i>We were talking and Tony thought
it should have a quote on it.</i>

590
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,636
Just... I'm really busy right
now, you know.

591
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,571
I'm planning a wedding
and I'm dog-sitting.

592
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,107
And then, then I have this
friend that I'm driving places.

593
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,375
And so it's, it's...

594
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,911
You know, I really got
a lot going...

595
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,213
Oh, shoot, Ange, I just...

596
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,881
There's a problem I got to fix,

597
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,183
so, you know,
can I call you back?

598
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,019
I'll call you back, okay. Bye.

599
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,232
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

600
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,069
Is it something that happened
at work?

601
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,038
He just always does this to me.

602
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,540
Your boss?
No. No, my brother.

603
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,076
He sends this e-mail saying
he wants to see me.

604
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,946
I'm not even talking to him, but
he's still telling me what to do.

605
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,280
Why aren't you talking to him?

606
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,682
He's always getting me
in trouble.

607
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,684
It's the same thing
since we were kids.

608
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,252
As soon as I get
something good going,

609
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,621
he goes and just tries
to wreck it.

610
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,829
You know, Freddy, sometimes a person
seems like they don't really care,

611
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:49,599
but really they're just
not as strong as you are.

612
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:55,305
I bet your mother would be really
happy if you gave him another chance.

613
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,478
Anyway, thanks.

614
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,886
Be extraordinary!

615
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,756
I just... I will wear anything, but
I do not look good in strapless.

616
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:16,727
No. I mean, I don't look good
in anything, so I don't know.

617
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:19,229
That's crazy. But everybody
looks good in a wrap dress.

618
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,965
Excuse me,
how many bridesmaids are there?

619
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,535
Oh, well, there's me,
Emily, Trish, Stacy, Casey.

620
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:29,906
Wow.
Katie m., Katie p., Molly,

621
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,943
- Gina, Amy, fern...
- Fern.

622
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,878
Oh, and Wendy.

623
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
Who am I forgetting?

624
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,949
Oh, Lori.
If she's even in town.

625
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,951
Oh, she'll be there.
Are you sure?

626
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:43,553
'Cause the dresses are color
coordinated, and we need an odd number.

627
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,422
She'll be there.
I'll make sure.

628
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,691
Okay. Did you really
book blues traveler?

629
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,961
The guy with the harmonica?
Yeah. He's fantastic.

630
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,929
Very cool.
Yeah, really cool.

631
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,865
Okay, you guys...

632
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,833
That's it.

633
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:57,934
It's really white.

634
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,736
This is the one.

635
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,204
I could murder you.

636
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,372
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

637
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,342
You look so skinny.
Okay.

638
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:08,211
Well, no, don't fall so in love
yet, because I'm actually,

639
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,446
I'm not gonna get
this exact dress,

640
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,314
but I am gonna copy the design

641
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,817
and buy cheaper fabric, and then
have it made at half the price.

642
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,118
Oh, Jesus.

643
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,156
You look so beautiful.
Oh...

644
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,391
I'm so happy for her.
Are you okay?

645
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,460
Don't do this. She's so skinny.
She looks fantastic.

646
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:24,995
Don't do that.
Happy for her?

647
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,531
No, I'm really happy for her.
Do you really love it?

648
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,600
Oh, Marnie, of course,
but, you know...

649
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,869
She looks great.
She looks really lovely.

650
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,037
- What...
- No!

651
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,872
What did... no!
What did you do?

652
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,642
What?
Marnie! No, Marnie!

653
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:40,310
Oh, my god!
No, you should have it.

654
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,212
Okay, I know you're not
my birth mother,

655
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,947
but will you please
be my earth mother?

656
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,582
No!
What!

657
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,285
My mom's not dead,
but will you be mine, too?

658
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,887
- And mine, please!
- Mine, too!

659
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,630
<i>Anyway, I just wanted to make
sure you're gonna be back in time</i>

660
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,732
<i>for what's-her-name's wedding.</i>

661
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,267
<i>I don't think
you're gonna want to miss it.</i>

662
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,436
For making squished sandwiches
with it...

663
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,772
Oh, Paninis.
Paninis, yeah.

664
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,641
<i>It's gonna be the party
of the century.</i>

665
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:15,178
<i>So hopefully, you don't have
to do re-shoots or whatever.</i>

666
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,047
Anyway,
I hope you're having fun.

667
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:20,617
I'm kind of dying
to find out how it's going.

668
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,820
I miss you, but, basically,
I feel fine.

669
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:28,558
So, give me a call,
but if you can't...

670
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,029
What the hell, lady?

671
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,865
Okay. Love you.

672
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,076
And then I realized that Freddy
didn't have anyone to study with.

673
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:51,681
So, I found out what classes he was
taking and what books he needed,

674
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,518
and I got them on Amazon,
half-price.

675
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,753
So now I can help him study.

676
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,689
Hmm. Why do you think
you're helping him?

677
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,560
Well, he comes from a poor neighborhood,
his mother works all the time,

678
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:07,964
and, you know, education is
the most important thing to him.

679
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,333
And Jillian?
Jillian?

680
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,436
Well, Jillian, she never had
a proper lesbian wedding.

681
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,239
And... I had the money

682
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,342
and so I thought,
"I can do that."

683
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,745
What's Jillian's last name?

684
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,216
Begins with a "g"...

685
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,185
Or a "k".

686
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,853
It's a consonant.

687
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,255
A consonant.
A consonant.

688
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,091
Marnie?
Hmm?

689
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,694
Do you think there's
a part of you

690
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:41,831
that maybe feels guilty that
you have your husband's money?

691
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,601
Like you've been given
this consolation prize...

692
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:47,270
You don't know what to do with?

693
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,107
Or maybe there's
a part of you...

694
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:55,245
That feels like maybe money
is the way to save everybody.

695
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,915
Or possibly even a way to stay
in people's lives and be needed?

696
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:04,588
And that this relationship that
you have with Freddy and Jillian,

697
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,558
it's really all about just replacing
your own husband and daughter?

698
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:14,264
So I told her, "I don't need
to replace anyone."

699
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,733
And why would I feel guilty
about Joe's money?

700
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,202
I mean, he started out from nothing.
He worked hard all his life.

701
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,838
He would have wanted me to do
something good with it, right?

702
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,106
Like Cinderella.

703
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,141
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

704
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,544
But she kept asking me
all these questions

705
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,446
and saying all this stuff.

706
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:32,983
And I was like, "you're a therapist.
Aren't you supposed to listen?"

707
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,320
Anyways...

708
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,659
You know, this is one of the
best hospitals in the country.

709
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,307
No. Well, it was my husband's.
So, yeah, I guess it is.

710
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,476
Got room for one more?

711
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,346
Marnie, this is my brother,
Fredo.

712
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:13,550
Yeah. Well, oh, my.
So nice to meet you.

713
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:17,620
I kinda promised him we'd give him
a ride someplace. Is that cool?

714
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,556
Actually, I have one stop
to make first.

715
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,224
Oh, sure, sure.

716
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,993
Any brother of Freddy's
is a friend of mine.

717
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,528
Shotgun!

718
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,565
Hey, does the top
come down on this thing?

719
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,166
Sure.
Yeah.

720
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,135
See, this the kinda car I want.

721
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:35,572
Except I'll paint mine black,
you know, like a matte black.

722
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,440
Ooh, that's an idea.

723
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:40,176
Hey, you remember that time
Tre stole that car,

724
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,678
but it turned out to be
a hearse,

725
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,280
and you were so
scared you pissed your pants?

726
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,385
He was so scared.

727
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,859
I'll just be two minutes.
Sure.

728
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,967
Sorry about this,
but thanks for taking him.

729
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,369
Of course, it's nice to see
the two of you together.

730
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,471
Hey, man.

731
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,074
You know, if you want,

732
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,443
we could stop for ice cream
on the way back.

733
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:27,323
And the difference between
a veto and a pocket veto?

734
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:33,196
A pocket veto is when the president
doesn't sign a bill for ten days,

735
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,099
but congress can't overrule it.

736
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,067
Yes! You are ready, Freddy.

737
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,069
Oh. "Ready Freddy."
I like that.

738
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,005
That's funny.

739
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,072
What's that?

740
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,343
Fredo... he's...

741
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,546
I'm sorry.
Is that marijuana?

742
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:50,947
It must have fallen...
What's it doing...

743
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,850
Oh, my god.
Okay, okay, what do we do?

744
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:56,553
What are we gonna do?
Sorry, Joey.

745
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:00,123
What are you doing?
What are you...?

746
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:07,730
Okay...

747
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,532
Are you all right, ma'am?

748
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,014
Uh...

749
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,025
<i>How did all these people
get in my room?</i>

750
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,326
<i>And don't tell your papa!</i>

751
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,201
Can I help you?

752
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,537
How much are the pies?

753
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,506
They're all $12.

754
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:59,342
I can have all of them for $12?

755
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,650
Hey, I know you.

756
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,619
Nope.

757
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,988
Sure, I do.
You're an actress, right?

758
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,958
You're a police officer man.

759
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,360
Yeah, well, retired,
technically,

760
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:19,929
but they still need us on set.

761
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,332
You know, in case a director
starts throwing stuff.

762
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,402
Everybody calls me zipper.

763
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,605
Okay.

764
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:32,108
And you are miss...?

765
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,676
Minervini.

766
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,244
Miss Minervini.

767
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,081
Mrs. Minervini.

768
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,349
Missus.

769
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:41,150
Well, actually, I don't know
if it's still missus

770
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,454
because my husband died,
and I... I'm sorry.

771
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,888
Thank you.

772
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,326
It goes back to maybe
the maiden name, or...

773
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:52,795
'cause when you're divorced
I don't think that you still...

774
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,132
I mean, that's... of course that's
different, but I think maybe...

775
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,534
Just... it would be...

776
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:02,305
Less confusing if you call me...

777
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,307
Marnie.

778
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,877
Okay, Marnie.

779
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:11,114
Well, Marnie,
do you wanna join us?

780
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,215
Us?

781
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:14,417
In a different language.
Portuguese.

782
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,391
So, we get to the area and,
sure enough,

783
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:22,992
there is this naked guy,

784
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,662
and he's just walking
up the street...

785
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,870
refuses to put on clothes
or get in the car,

786
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,806
and Bernie suggests that we...

787
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,744
He would not go down!

788
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,346
He just stands there, vibrating!

789
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,814
Just pointing north!

790
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,483
Oh, pardon my language.

791
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,054
Were you talking?

792
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,427
Thank you.

793
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,198
Sorry about that. Those...

794
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,700
Those guys are...
They're good guys,

795
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:06,502
but they do like hearing
themselves talk.

796
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:09,305
Well, if I had those stories,
I would listen to myself think.

797
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,077
Well...

798
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,215
I gotta get going.

799
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,719
I have to... dog-sit
my daughter's kids,

800
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,456
and, you know,
my hands are... loud.

801
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,593
Okay.

802
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:34,564
Do you maybe need a ride or...

803
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,766
No, I can't drive that.

804
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,901
Okay.

805
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,903
How about just this
once I drive it,

806
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,672
and you can sit on the back?

807
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:46,776
That's crazy. I would kill my
daughter if she died on a motorcycle.

808
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:48,344
Oh, this isn't a motorcycle.

809
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,048
This is a Harley Davidson.

810
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,916
It's a world of difference.

811
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,753
Come on, it'll be fun.

812
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,155
The safest place you can be
in Los Angeles

813
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:03,459
is on this seat right here.
I promise.

814
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,161
I'll go slow.

815
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,362
Uh...

816
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,302
So tell me about your daughter.

817
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,837
Not now!

818
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,845
So why do they call you zipper?

819
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,614
It's my name.

820
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,849
Oh...
My last name.

821
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,684
Then... that makes sense.

822
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,686
Yeah.
What's your first name?

823
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,222
Randy. Or Randall.

824
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,490
Randall.

825
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:36,259
And are you from around here?

826
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:38,261
Am I asking too many questions?

827
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:40,863
No.

828
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,866
I'm from outside
Oxnard originally.

829
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:46,335
And then I moved to Ventura
when I got married,

830
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:49,772
and moved to Topanga
when I got divorced.

831
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:50,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

832
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:54,343
Oh, don't be sorry.
She's not.

833
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,115
You know, she never smiled
with her teeth.

834
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,083
I should've known.

835
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,221
Is Topanga on the beach?

836
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:09,759
No, not on the beach,
by the beach.

837
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,661
I wouldn't mind living
on the beach.

838
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,663
Yeah.

839
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:16,365
But I don't know
where I'd keep the chickens.

840
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,935
Chickens?

841
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,172
Yeah. Yeah. You got your dog
people and your cat people.

842
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,908
I am a man with chickens.

843
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,510
Get outta here.

844
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:28,611
No...

845
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:31,314
Chickens?
Absolutely.

846
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:32,515
How many?

847
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,284
Well, you know what they say
about counting chickens?

848
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,552
No.

849
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,921
You don't know what they say

850
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:40,323
about counting chickens, really?

851
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,390
No.

852
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:43,192
Didn't your grandma
ever tell you that?

853
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,895
No, we didn't... my grandma
didn't have chickens.

854
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:48,397
Oh, yeah. You are a
city girl, aren't you?

855
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,934
Well, my chickens and I have
a very symbiotic relationship.

856
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,437
I give them a Coop
and some feed,

857
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:57,473
once in a while, a little
Parmesan cheese for a treat,

858
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,375
and they keep me in eggs.

859
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,646
Matter of fact... excuse me.

860
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,751
Oh, I can't believe
it didn't break.

861
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:12,355
Yeah. That's from the Ameraucana.
She's my only Easter Egger

862
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,324
wow.

863
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,593
You wanna meet her?

864
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,662
At your house?

865
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,665
Well, she's been out at the bar
most of the night,

866
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,367
but she's probably home by now.

867
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,943
Watch your step there.

868
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,344
Here, let me go in first.

869
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:38,381
Make sure we don't let
anybody escape.

870
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:46,022
Well, now here's...
That's patsy, and Kathleen.

871
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,424
Over here is, that's Ayla.

872
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,460
Katie and Ruth.
That's Gayle.

873
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:55,398
And... the golden girl there
is Henrietta.

874
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,733
And now don't let her sass you.

875
00:48:57,735 --> 00:49:01,437
She gets a little attitude on
account of she's so damn beautiful.

876
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,772
So beautiful.

877
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,573
Girls, this is Marnie.

878
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,542
Hey.

879
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,879
Was out here
a couple months ago,

880
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:13,582
and I brought that boom box with
me and I was playing some tunes.

881
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:17,086
And I looked at their faces, and
I swear they just looked happy.

882
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:18,821
So I did a little experiment

883
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:21,757
to try and find out what kind
of music they dig the most.

884
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,593
Turns out, rock 'n' roll
makes 'em lay eggs like crazy,

885
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,896
but it does stress 'em out
a little bit.

886
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:28,597
Oh, I understand.

887
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,767
Classical's good.
They like that.

888
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:33,869
Reggae, not good.
Really?

889
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:36,038
No. Don't know what it is.

890
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,077
Turns out, for the optimal combination
of happiness and productivity...

891
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,447
All roads lead to Dolly.

892
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,699
How can you tell
if it's working?

893
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,636
Don't they look like
they're smiling?

894
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,342
Yeah, they do.

895
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,627
Joey didn't want to know how
much time he had left,

896
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,029
but Lori and I knew.

897
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,498
And he asked her to throw us

898
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,268
a wedding anniversary party
in August.

899
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,505
But... she knew he
wouldn't be around that long,

900
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:46,375
so she said,
which was so brilliant...

901
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,576
"Why don't I throw you

902
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:51,013
"a '40 years from the day
you met' party?"

903
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:54,316
And she decorated
the whole house like 1969.

904
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:56,719
And the music was 1969,

905
00:50:56,721 --> 00:51:00,056
and all her friends
came dressed like the '60s.

906
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:04,326
And his brothers flew out,
and we had fondue.

907
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,630
It was a spectacular day.

908
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,666
What about you?

909
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,034
You got kids?

910
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:13,235
Two beautiful girls.

911
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,471
Aw, nice.
Yeah.

912
00:51:15,473 --> 00:51:17,773
The one that likes me lives
halfway across the country,

913
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:21,010
and the one that doesn't
is just over in palm Springs.

914
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:22,845
Of course.

915
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,547
Lizzie was...

916
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:27,483
She was still in high school
when her mom and I fell apart,

917
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:30,686
which was my fault, mostly.

918
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:32,354
Seventy-thirty.

919
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,324
Sixty-forty maybe.

920
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:40,229
I was working all the time,
you know.

921
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:42,131
And then I brought it home
with me.

922
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:47,336
And then, when she started to slip
away, I was just gripping and...

923
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:53,175
She's in a reha...
In a program now.

924
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:56,345
She's in a program.

925
00:51:56,347 --> 00:52:00,616
Kept hoping one of those steps
would lead her back here, but...

926
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:06,155
I think I just made her
scared to tell me things.

927
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:07,656
Sure, what...

928
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,959
Look what you were
seeing every day,

929
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:12,294
all that serial killers
and stuff.

930
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,498
I mean, I watch the news,
never mind being part of it,

931
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,834
it's like being in
an action movie or something.

932
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:20,302
Yeah, well...

933
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,272
Not anymore.

934
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:26,408
It's not your fault
the world's a scary place.

935
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,478
Thank god you're retired.

936
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,515
Yep. Yeah, it has its moments.

937
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,817
And I have learned to calm down.

938
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,920
You know, I mean, if...

939
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,089
Lizzie doesn't want me
to call her anymore,

940
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:41,524
I have to respect that.

941
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:45,127
No. You don't... I mean...

942
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,263
You can't not call.

943
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,298
Well, I mean, I...

944
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,734
I left messages
until it was full.

945
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:52,868
So?

946
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,870
Sorry.

947
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:58,507
I mean, it's not my business,
but you have to call her.

948
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,777
Well, I...

949
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,146
I really wouldn't know
what to say.

950
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:07,683
You just tell her that you love
her no matter she's up to.

951
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:11,253
You know, everybody knows their
mother loves them unconditionally,

952
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,223
but fathers have to
say it out loud, I think.

953
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,500
What time is it?

954
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,288
Here you go, I'll trade you.

955
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,957
Thanks.
Oh...

956
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,993
Take that, too.

957
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,163
Wow, thank you.

958
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:55,397
Uh...

959
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,101
Hang on here, let me...

960
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,237
Let me give you this.

961
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,138
You know,
in case you need to get out

962
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,773
of a speeding ticket
or something.

963
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,310
Cool.

964
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,318
Here, doggies.

965
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,610
Mmm.

966
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:05,027
<i>Anyway, I'm landing
at JFK at 5:30.</i>

967
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,229
<i>Just thought I should head
back east for a little bit,</i>

968
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:10,966
<i>see daddy's brothers and maybe
get to visit you on the set.</i>

969
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,869
<i>Don't worry about the dogs.</i>

970
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,637
<i>I dropped them off
at Jacob's house</i>

971
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,539
<i>so they'd be somewhere familiar.</i>

972
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:22,711
<i>To be honest, I can't wait
to be back in the city.</i>

973
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,149
<i>Seeing the old stomping grounds,</i>

974
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:31,453
<i>walking through midtown
in the garment district,</i>

975
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,589
<i>and seeing daddy's old building.</i>

976
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,629
<i>But mostly,
I can't wait to see you.</i>

977
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:43,399
<i>So, let me know
when's a good time.</i>

978
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,271
We skip that, because that's,
like, the whole point.

979
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:51,173
That's like the only real thing.
Know what I mean?

980
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,776
It just feels like none of these
things my character would say.

981
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:55,711
Is there any way
we can get some new pages?

982
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:58,313
What would you like to say?
Just something less jokey.

983
00:56:58,315 --> 00:56:59,515
Hi!

984
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,950
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

985
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,619
Hi.
Hi.

986
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:05,921
Thanks.
I'm gonna find you and...

987
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,657
Um... hi. Hi, mom.
Hi, sweetie.

988
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,592
This is your chair, okay?
Okay. Yes.

989
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,929
And, uh...

990
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,298
This...
These are your headphones.

991
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,902
Okay? And...
Don't talk to anybody.

992
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,404
Just... and the safe word
is "cantaloupe."

993
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:23,872
Okay.
Okay?

994
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,007
Okay.

995
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,779
On the bell.

996
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,486
And, action.

997
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,154
All right. Call me, okay?

998
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:42,024
Good night.

999
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:45,060
Oh! Jesus! Mom, you scared
the crap out of me!

1000
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,596
Come on, don't you have
ice-cream in the guest house?

1001
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:51,233
Well, yeah, but I already picked
all the cookie dough out of it.

1002
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,001
What are you reading?

1003
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:55,237
Is that my journal?
Is that what this is?

1004
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,372
I thought the character
was a little slutty.

1005
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:58,774
Give me that.

1006
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,776
Aren't you too old
to keep a journal?

1007
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,911
Aren't you too old to be reading
your daughter's journal?

1008
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,314
That's a violation
of space and time!

1009
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:08,450
Hey, hey, hey! Now, what's
all the yelling about? Huh?

1010
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:10,352
I violated space and time.

1011
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:15,858
Ah. So, what, you... you peed in
the upstairs, shower, too, huh?

1012
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,026
What's wrong with the shower
in the guest house?

1013
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:21,964
Well, it's got this,
weird smell.

1014
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,870
Mom, dad, when I said you should
move here after you retire,

1015
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:30,205
I didn't mean mean "here," here.
Okay? I need to get a life.

1016
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,542
I need to meet a guy and get married,
so I can give you grandchildren, so...

1017
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,078
Wet towel, dad.

1018
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,423
Cut!

1019
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:54,129
Here, and jump
straight to there.

1020
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,431
I just feel like we could
land it a little better.

1021
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:59,701
And we need another option for that.
All right.

1022
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,637
I think, definitely,
write that down.

1023
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,475
Hey, you. That was so good.

1024
00:59:06,477 --> 00:59:08,844
Not too big?
Did you love it?

1025
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,379
- Perfect.
- Space and time...

1026
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:13,148
Great, great, great, great.
Awesome, man. Thanks.

1027
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,696
You look so much like him.

1028
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,632
I'm sorry?

1029
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:35,537
The... character that
you're playing, it... it's...

1030
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:39,708
You look so much like
the man that it's based on.

1031
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,911
I didn't realize it was,
you know, based on...

1032
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,113
So much like...
Cantaloupe!

1033
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,084
Would you like some cantaloupe,

1034
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,853
because we have
a fresh tray going around?

1035
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:54,823
And then that's when,
that's when he looks down

1036
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,758
and sees this giant snake right there.
No, no, no!

1037
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,226
And he's like... he's like,

1038
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,929
"jock! What's this
huge snake in the plane?"

1039
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,198
And, and jock's like,
"oh, that's just Reggie."

1040
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,734
And, and Indy's like,
"I hate snakes!"

1041
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:08,670
And then they just fly off
into the sunset.

1042
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:10,672
Yeah. And that's
the first 20 minutes

1043
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:12,941
of Indiana Jones and
the<i> raiders of the lost ark.</i>

1044
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,576
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.

1045
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,178
I never saw it.
What?

1046
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,714
No. I feel like I've seen it
now, but I never saw it.

1047
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,782
Well, we gotta watch it
before you leave town.

1048
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:21,984
All right.
Movie night.

1049
01:00:21,986 --> 01:00:24,353
I like it.
Thank you.

1050
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:26,088
Drink it, drink it, drink it,
drink it, drink it...

1051
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,724
- You two meet on the set?
- Mm-hm.

1052
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:31,159
Yeah, just two weeks ago.

1053
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:34,229
Like I was telling you, right
before you asked him to dinner.

1054
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:37,165
I think it is so romantic,
meeting on a movie set.

1055
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,935
Well, not really, I mean, plenty
of people meet on movie sets.

1056
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,770
It's usually scandalous
and home-wrecking.

1057
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,005
That's so true. So true.

1058
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:45,240
I met Lori's father
in Atlantic city.

1059
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:47,142
It was pretty romantic.

1060
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,777
And then we got married
six months later.

1061
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:49,945
Six months?

1062
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:51,446
Yeah. I think when you know,
you know.

1063
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,288
I totally agree with you,
you know something...

1064
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,386
You know, I'm just gonna
run to the bathroom.

1065
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:59,955
Tinkle time.

1066
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:03,091
Okay, hurry back.
Dinner's coming.

1067
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,626
Oh, you...

1068
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:06,495
Yeah, there we go.

1069
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:09,131
She's so lovely.

1070
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:11,099
Good job.
She is lovely. Thank you.

1071
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:13,168
Yeah. So, hey...

1072
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,841
Oh, my god.

1073
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,310
I got that the day after we met.

1074
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:24,880
You know, when I know
I want something, I go get it.

1075
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,015
That's how I got this far
in my career.

1076
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,185
Russell Boyd, Rodney charters,
don Mcalpine.

1077
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,422
When the top cinematographers
need a b camera operator,

1078
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:34,956
do you know who they call?

1079
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:38,093
You? Boom! When you
know, you know!

1080
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,163
Wow.

1081
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:44,766
Yeah.
It's so fast.

1082
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,334
But, if Lori's happy...

1083
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:49,104
I was thinking we'd get
everyone she knows together,

1084
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:53,141
and we... we put together
one of those YouTube videos.

1085
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:55,243
And everyone she knows
comes out one by one,

1086
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,446
doing a choreographed
dance number.

1087
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:59,681
And then it ends with me
appearing with the ring...

1088
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:03,218
This will all be one
tracking shot, of course.

1089
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,654
I love it. Oh, my gosh.
That's so beautiful.

1090
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:09,024
I'm gonna propose to her...
She's gonna love it.

1091
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:11,193
I just feel like the whole thing

1092
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:15,697
is getting bastardized
by everybody's notes, you know?

1093
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:21,002
By now, I can't even remember what I
was trying to say in the first place.

1094
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,370
Why are you so hyper?

1095
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,806
I'm not.
I'm just excited for you.

1096
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:27,843
And... Ben seems nice.

1097
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:30,011
Yeah, well,
do not get used to him, mom,

1098
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:32,314
because that's not gonna last.

1099
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,015
I'm not so sure.

1100
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:37,052
No, I'm telling you,
I'm just rebounding.

1101
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:40,789
But, you know, sometimes people think
that they're having a rebound,

1102
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,091
and then it evolves
into something more.

1103
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,629
Actually, there's something
I have to tell you.

1104
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,064
Come here.

1105
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,938
I was engaged to someone else
before daddy.

1106
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,274
Yeah, you told me that before.

1107
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,408
I did?

1108
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,777
Yeah, his name was Matteo,

1109
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,445
and you weren't
that attracted to him,

1110
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,680
then you went to Atlantic city
with your girlfriends,

1111
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:06,948
and that's where you met daddy.

1112
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,617
You have, like, three stories,
mom.

1113
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:11,219
All right, all right,
so you're rebounding.

1114
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:13,381
Well, then, why don't you
and Jacob give it another go?

1115
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,295
Because that's not up to me.

1116
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,865
Well... maybe if you tell him
how you feel.

1117
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,201
See that's the great lie
of your life, mom.

1118
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:28,370
You think if you dream it,
you can do it.

1119
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,939
The world just doesn't work that way.
What are you talking about?

1120
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:33,675
You dreamt that you would be
a writer, and you did it.

1121
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:36,178
You dreamt you would come
to Hollywood, and you did it.

1122
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,880
You dream up lots of stories,
all the time.

1123
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,316
Oh. That reminds me,

1124
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,351
I met the cutest girl
in the bathroom at JFK.

1125
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:46,087
She's, in a wheelchair
and she's a blogger.

1126
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,622
She empowers young women.

1127
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,357
And, I told her you were
a writer.

1128
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,726
She didn't know who you were,
but she was very, very excited

1129
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,128
about the possibility...

1130
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,429
I told her you would have
coffee with her

1131
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,731
and give her some industry tips.

1132
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:58,800
I don't have any industry tips.

1133
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,902
Well, it's just coffee.

1134
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,838
She's in a wheelchair.

1135
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,925
How do you take a selfie?

1136
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:27,395
What do you mean? You just
take a picture of yourself.

1137
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:30,732
Yeah, but, how do you
take a picture of yourself?

1138
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:32,934
Who are you sending a selfie to?

1139
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,037
Shh! Shh!

1140
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,339
Just never mind.

1141
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,774
Never mind.
Do you have a new friend?

1142
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,309
My... I'm not talking about it.

1143
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,344
Ooh.

1144
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,679
I'm not talking about it.
Mom!

1145
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,982
Stop.
Who's your new friend?

1146
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:48,416
I'm not talking about it.
It's not funny.

1147
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:50,385
I'm not talking about...
Can I meet him?

1148
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,687
Where are the bottles? They in here?
Did you meet him at the grove?

1149
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:53,788
Oh, stop it.

1150
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,223
Huh?
Stop it.

1151
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:00,762
<i>This is obviously me.</i>

1152
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:03,131
Hi, zipper.

1153
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:05,800
It's, Marnie Minervini.

1154
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:08,870
I'm calling from New York,
with my daughter.

1155
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:10,305
She's doing her TV show.

1156
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:14,643
And... today I saw the set
and it made me think of you.

1157
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:17,012
I mean, 'cause of your job.

1158
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:19,981
Also, I mean, what you do
for a living.

1159
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:24,319
Anyway, so, I ordered some scrambled
eggs at the hotel this morning,

1160
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:27,555
and they were nothing
like what I had of yours.

1161
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,691
I mean,
the eggs that you gave me.

1162
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:31,893
I had one.

1163
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,095
Briefly.

1164
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,798
And so I just thought I would...

1165
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,635
Check in on the chickens.

1166
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:44,072
Also... oh, yes, my daughter
has a new boyfriend.

1167
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:46,441
Or should I say fiancé?

1168
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,210
Yep. So, okay.

1169
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:53,615
So, call me.
Okay, love you... bye!

1170
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,517
Bye.

1171
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,220
Marnie!
Marnie!

1172
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,192
Mwah!

1173
01:06:06,897 --> 01:06:08,296
You look very good. California.

1174
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,831
You look very good, very well.

1175
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:16,037
So, Tina, Pina,
how are you feeling?

1176
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,572
Mm...
Mm...

1177
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:18,373
Mm...

1178
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,175
Hey, how's the TV show?

1179
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:22,077
So funny.
You would not believe.

1180
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,113
I don't know where
she gets her characters from.

1181
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,715
She's a very smart girl.

1182
01:06:26,717 --> 01:06:28,750
Good imagination more than anything.
That is mine.

1183
01:06:28,752 --> 01:06:30,118
Salute. Eh?

1184
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,097
Very sweet grapes.

1185
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,099
You don't...
You don't remember?

1186
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,700
- No.
- No.

1187
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,168
You're two years younger than me.
You don't remember?

1188
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,203
I remember the grub.

1189
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:49,771
Yeah.
That smells good.

1190
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:54,075
So, the first time I cooked
for Joe, I wanted to make pasta.

1191
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:56,845
And my mother told me that the
way you know if pasta's done

1192
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:59,514
- is you throw it against the wall...
- Oh, no.

1193
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:04,686
And if it sticks, then you
take it out of the water.

1194
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,921
So I boiled the water.

1195
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:08,523
I break the pasta in half...

1196
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,161
I know. I know.

1197
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,963
And I start cooking it.

1198
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:20,101
- And... and then I...
- Throw it against the wall.

1199
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:22,637
Nothing. Nothing.

1200
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:25,774
So then I cook it a little bit
more, cook it a little bit more.

1201
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:30,111
And then finally I throw it against
the wall, and it stuck to the wall.

1202
01:07:30,113 --> 01:07:33,114
And it stuck to itself.
And it stuck to the pot.

1203
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,484
And it stuck
to everything it touched.

1204
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:40,422
So, Joe takes his first bite.

1205
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:43,024
So, it seems okay.
Takes his first bite.

1206
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:46,995
And then I see him take a little
bit of the pasta off the plate,

1207
01:07:46,997 --> 01:07:49,230
and he puts it in a napkin.

1208
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,233
And I say to him,
"what are you doing?"

1209
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:56,438
And he says, "I just gotta
show this to my mother."

1210
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,949
Yeah, it was a lucky thing we
were married already. Right?

1211
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:09,517
I would have had a problem.

1212
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,954
I can't believe...

1213
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:16,491
I can't believe it's
his anniversary already.

1214
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:19,794
I know, already a year.
Unbelievable.

1215
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:21,362
You mean two years.

1216
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,299
Yeah. A year from last year.

1217
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:25,834
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

1218
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:27,335
Time flies, huh?

1219
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:30,271
- Time flies.
- Time flies.

1220
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,007
So, Marnie...

1221
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:35,443
We were thinking that...

1222
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,414
You can keep half of his ashes
with you and Lori in California,

1223
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:42,650
and, the other half
could be buried in Elizabeth.

1224
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,752
- That way...
- We have some place...

1225
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:47,956
Yeah, we all have some place to go.
Yeah, we'll visit, you know.

1226
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,524
Yeah. Um...

1227
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:52,160
You know, I really think that
I want to talk to Lori about it,

1228
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:54,295
'cause she's been very sensitive
about the whole thing.

1229
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,631
We already talked to her and what
did she say? We talked to her.

1230
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,000
She says it's up to you.
Up to you.

1231
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:00,602
Oh.

1232
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:03,805
Since we're all
on the east coast, for a change,

1233
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,940
we could at least pick out
a headstone.

1234
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:08,676
Lori said you wanted
to use a quote, maybe.

1235
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:10,245
Yeah, something
from "my way."

1236
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:11,813
It doesn't have
to be "my way."

1237
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,214
How could it not be "my way"?

1238
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:14,582
As long as it's Sinatra.

1239
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:16,384
Well, of course, it is
Sinatra, obviously.

1240
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:18,219
It should be "my way."
That was his... it should be...

1241
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:23,091
Marnie, it is all up to you.

1242
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,962
If you want to bury
his ashes here, okay.

1243
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,865
And if you wanted to
just sprinkle a little here,

1244
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,001
sprinkle a little
over there, fine.

1245
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,769
Boom, boom, boom.

1246
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:36,004
Up to you.

1247
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,539
How could it not be "my way"?

1248
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,175
How could it not be "my way"?

1249
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:41,676
Of course.
It has to be "my way"!

1250
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,978
We talking about Joe!
Joe did it his way!

1251
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,448
He lived his way!
It has to be "my way"!

1252
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,551
No "strangers in the night."
"My way"!

1253
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,892
"Joseph Minervini"?

1254
01:09:57,894 --> 01:09:59,360
What?

1255
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:02,697
Oh.

1256
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,266
I... I handed you
my husband's license.

1257
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,436
There.

1258
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:10,705
"Marnie Minervini."
That makes more sense.

1259
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,141
And where you headed today,
Ms. Minervini?

1260
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:16,110
Los Angeles.
I live there now.

1261
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,545
How was your time in New York?

1262
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:20,748
Great.
My daughter shot a pilot.

1263
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,122
Oh!

1264
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,490
No. It's...

1265
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:30,785
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles,
where the local time is 10:37.</i>

1266
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,054
<i>Please remain in your seat
while we taxi to the gate.</i>

1267
01:11:33,056 --> 01:11:35,857
<i>If your cell phone is within
reach, you may use it now.</i>

1268
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,501
<i>Hey, Marnie, it's your
new friend, zipper,</i>

1269
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:49,237
<i>or Randy, I guess,
depending on who you ask.</i>

1270
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:50,705
<i>I just saw that you called.</i>

1271
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:52,373
<i>Sorry I'm just getting
back to you now.</i>

1272
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,576
<i>There's, just terrible
reception in the canyon.</i>

1273
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:57,111
<i>I could barely hear
your message.</i>

1274
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,815
<i>But... just wanted
to try you back</i>

1275
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,418
<i>and see how the east coast
is treating you,</i>

1276
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:09,023
<i>and also let you know that the chickens
have expanded their musical library</i>

1277
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:12,927
<i>to include Peggy Lee now, as
well as, Dolly Parton covers,</i>

1278
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:17,031
<i>so I guess you've got that
to look forward to,</i>

1279
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,634
<i>if you ever make it back
this way. But...</i>

1280
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:23,104
<i>Anyway, give me a call if,
you know, if you get a chance.</i>

1281
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:25,640
<i>And, yeah, there you go.</i>

1282
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:28,343
<i>Okay. "Love you." Bye.</i>

1283
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,452
<i>Hey, Marnie,
it's your new friend zipper...</i>

1284
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:39,587
<i>Anyway, just wanted
to let you know</i>

1285
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:41,856
<i>that I made it back
to the west coast,</i>

1286
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:45,727
<i>and... it's a shame you're gonna miss
the wedding because of reshoots.</i>

1287
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:48,096
<i>Oh, and sorry to hear
you broke up with Ben.</i>

1288
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:50,531
<i>I guess you didn't like
the YouTube video?</i>

1289
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:55,069
<i>Anyway, I know you're busy, so
don't worry about calling me back.</i>

1290
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:26,134
Hi.

1291
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,604
Uh...

1292
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,739
You didn't hear any, kind of,

1293
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,509
music-type sounds coming
from inside, did you?

1294
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:37,011
That wasn't you, was it?

1295
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:40,715
Just a little Dolly cover band
I'm putting together.

1296
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:43,317
Thus far we have a largely
avian fan base.

1297
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:46,687
What's this?

1298
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:49,590
Oh, nothing, I just...
I picked this up...

1299
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:53,628
To help... well, play music,
for, you know,

1300
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:56,697
Henrietta and Susan and Gayle

1301
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,699
and, you know, all your gals.

1302
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:01,769
You just plug it in your iPhone.

1303
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,738
God, do you have an iPhone?

1304
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:07,408
I've been meaning to get
one of those.

1305
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:11,412
Thank you.
It's... it's really nice.

1306
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:13,815
Um, you want to come inside?

1307
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:17,718
You can help me, whatever,
plug it in, figure it out.

1308
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,188
No, I'm supposed to go
to this wedding.

1309
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,590
Oh.

1310
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,459
Well, that's fun.
Yeah.

1311
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:27,595
So...

1312
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,566
You know...

1313
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,069
I missed you.

1314
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:37,538
I guess that sounds funny.

1315
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:42,276
Oh, I called her, by the way.

1316
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:43,578
Lizzie, my youngest.

1317
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,613
Zipper, that's great.

1318
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,982
She yelled at me.

1319
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,016
A lot.

1320
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:49,984
Aw.

1321
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,752
I was actually thinking
maybe tomorrow

1322
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,955
I might take a ride out there

1323
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:55,990
and let her scream
in my face a little.

1324
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:58,759
That's a good idea.
You think?

1325
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:00,428
Yeah.

1326
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,663
D-do you...
Do you wanna come with?

1327
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,736
Just a day trip.
Nothing overnight, or...

1328
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:11,005
I thought maybe you'd like
to see the desert. It's...

1329
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,741
It's beautiful.

1330
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,677
I can't.

1331
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,616
I can't right now. I...

1332
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,618
You know, I just...
I wanted to stop by

1333
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:28,289
and just drop
off the speakers, and...

1334
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,191
tell you that I'm
not gonna be around much

1335
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,959
because I've got to go
back east,

1336
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:36,230
and so I'm not gonna be
around much, for a while.

1337
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,934
Okay.

1338
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,679
One more.

1339
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:38,826
I'll take her, it's all right.
Come here, sweetie.

1340
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:26,207
Um... oh, wow.

1341
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:28,009
Thank you all so much.

1342
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:32,747
There are just so many people in this
room who made this day possible.

1343
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,615
I can't... I can't believe it.

1344
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:38,152
Um. First, my incredible wife...
Stop it.

1345
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:41,756
Who married me one year ago
against her better judgment.

1346
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,491
That's... well...

1347
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:46,527
And agreed to do it again, in front
of our loved ones... Well...

1348
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,429
Because she knew it was
important to me.

1349
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:49,764
Aw.

1350
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:51,132
To my bridesmaids.

1351
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:52,166
Whoo!

1352
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,969
Nobody could ask
for 13 greater friends,

1353
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:57,405
and I just love you guys
so much.

1354
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:01,676
And I wanna thank my family for flying
in from all across the country.

1355
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,744
Daddy, I love you.

1356
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:05,980
And Marnie...

1357
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:09,684
I mean, words cannot even begin

1358
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:12,620
to express my gratitude to you.

1359
01:18:12,622 --> 01:18:14,422
After my mother died, I just...

1360
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:17,892
I couldn't even imagine
that I could feel

1361
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:21,062
loved so unconditionally

1362
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:23,164
by someone who wasn't my family.

1363
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,900
I mean, you are,
you are real proof

1364
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:28,402
that when one angel
leaves this earth,

1365
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,805
another one takes its place.

1366
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,239
And I love you.

1367
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:35,509
- To Marnie!
- To Marnie!

1368
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:03,798
Thank you. Thank you.

1369
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,132
Thank you.

1370
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,767
Now we're gonna do a new one.

1371
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:09,436
Whoo!

1372
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,942
It's a slow song.

1373
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:18,112
I honestly don't remember the
last time I danced that much.

1374
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:20,414
I know, right? We used to dance
all the time when I was a kid.

1375
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:23,350
I tell Lori,
"why don't you go out dancing?"

1376
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,986
I mean, go out. Dance.

1377
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,956
You know, this is an amazing
thing you've done here, Marnie.

1378
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:31,292
They look really happy,
don't they?

1379
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,927
Yeah.

1380
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,534
So, look, about that lunch...
No, excuse me, one second.

1381
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:41,936
Okay.

1382
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,342
Jacob, hi.

1383
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,143
Hi.

1384
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:51,478
She loves you, you know.

1385
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,247
Lori loves you.

1386
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,382
And I know because I see
how unhappy she is

1387
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:56,851
since you guys split.

1388
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:59,987
And, I know everybody's supposed
to make their own happiness,

1389
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:01,388
but she's never been like that.

1390
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,023
Well, I mean,
maybe she was like that before,

1391
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:04,491
but she's not anymore,

1392
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:07,962
and I don't know if it's
too late for you guys,

1393
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:11,131
but I know it's
also totally awkward

1394
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:13,267
and I'm overstepping
my boundaries maybe...

1395
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:15,035
Well, I know I'm
overstepping my boundaries.

1396
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,571
But if there's just even
the slightest little chance

1397
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,673
that you could go back with her
and make her happy,

1398
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:22,243
well, then it doesn't matter,
because all that matters to me

1399
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:24,445
is that you make her happy
and that she be happy.

1400
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:28,415
That's all that matters.
So, what do you say?

1401
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,050
Marnie, I'm...

1402
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,053
I'm sorry, I...

1403
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:36,991
Hey.

1404
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:39,026
Oh, hi.

1405
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:41,662
Hi.
Hi.

1406
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:43,063
Yeah.

1407
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,400
So I'm... I was... going.

1408
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,768
See you.

1409
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,137
Marnie, why don't you stay
for one more drink. Huh?

1410
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,273
I got dogs to feed
and I've got a...

1411
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,676
Huh?

1412
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,147
Problem?

1413
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,950
All right.
Well, thank you very much.

1414
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:06,453
Well, it looks like
my car was stolen.

1415
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:09,356
My god, the crime
in this city...

1416
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:12,059
I'm sorry this is
how your night ends.

1417
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:15,229
It's crazy, yeah.

1418
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:18,232
Can't remember
when I had that much fun.

1419
01:22:18,234 --> 01:22:19,566
Yeah.
You know?

1420
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:22,937
It was nice. Couple of
Brooklynites, we are.

1421
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,673
Yeah. Yeah.

1422
01:22:25,675 --> 01:22:28,842
And that dress is... it's...

1423
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:30,244
It's just a knockout.

1424
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:32,947
Thanks. It's actually
my daughter's.

1425
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,448
Get outta here.

1426
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,152
The color, like blood red.

1427
01:22:38,154 --> 01:22:40,888
Blood... oh, yeah.

1428
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,690
I guess.

1429
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:44,124
Hm.

1430
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,093
And the hair to match.

1431
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:53,701
- Eyes! Throat!
- Ow!

1432
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:54,802
Crotch!
Oh!

1433
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:56,637
No. Out, out, out.

1434
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,273
Marnie! What...

1435
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:01,508
What are you doing?

1436
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,048
What the fuck?

1437
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,596
Yeah. I mean,
we have mostly apple products,

1438
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,164
'cause it's an apple-based
store.

1439
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,265
Wait, are you a student?

1440
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:26,934
Mm-hm.
Me, too.

1441
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:28,669
You can probably get
a student discount.

1442
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:30,437
Wait, you're really a student,
right?

1443
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:32,339
You'd be surprised how many
times I hear... no.

1444
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,907
I'm joking.

1445
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,712
Oh, shit. Sorry.

1446
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:47,354
Anyway, every year the writer's
pitch the studio their ideas.

1447
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,957
And the studio picks
a small percentage of those,

1448
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:52,259
to pay the writers
to make scripts.

1449
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:55,396
And then out of those scripts,
they pick even a smaller amount

1450
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:58,799
to shoot the pilot, to...
I mean, shoot the film.

1451
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:03,237
And then out of those, a handful
actually make it to the air.

1452
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:06,507
And then an even smaller amount
actually stay on the air,

1453
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:08,675
like Seinfeld or something,
right?

1454
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,479
Oh, you want the TV on?

1455
01:24:19,021 --> 01:24:20,320
Hello?

1456
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,122
<i>Mom, I need you.</i>

1457
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,691
Did you bring them?
Yeah, yeah.

1458
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,929
What are these?
Bagels.

1459
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:30,264
This is the pregnancy test.

1460
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,403
Why did you get the jumbo pack?

1461
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,305
I didn't know how many times
you have to do it.

1462
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:40,374
It's just the one time.

1463
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,478
Please don't watch me pee
on a stick.

1464
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:50,017
Not really that late, for me.

1465
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:51,785
It's probably just stress.

1466
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:53,620
I can't stop sleeping,
but that's about it.

1467
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:56,290
I just hope you know
who the father is.

1468
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,192
I can't believe
you just said that.

1469
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:00,794
Well, I didn't mean it
in a bad way.

1470
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,496
I slept with Jacob once

1471
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:05,999
when I had to go to his
house to pick up my dogs.

1472
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:07,301
Thanks to you.

1473
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:09,937
And besides,
I'm probably barren.

1474
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:11,738
That's something
you should worry about.

1475
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,308
I've a lot
of testosterone in me.

1476
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,144
There, see? Single line.

1477
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:18,846
No grandkids, congratulations.

1478
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,815
Lor?

1479
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,560
What the... what?

1480
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:45,172
What?
Maybe we should Google it.

1481
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:47,808
Google what?
For false positives, you know.

1482
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:50,310
It doesn't work like that.
It's not aids.

1483
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,279
I need to get a blood test.
For aids?

1484
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:54,448
No! Mom! For this!

1485
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:56,150
Are you here?
Sorry.

1486
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:57,951
I'm pregnant! Okay?

1487
01:25:57,953 --> 01:26:01,355
I'm too old to get
an abortion. I can't...

1488
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:04,158
This is real.
Well, don't be sad.

1489
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:07,895
Oh. Don't be sad. Lori?

1490
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:11,932
Don't be sad.

1491
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:13,867
I'm not.

1492
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:15,769
You're not?

1493
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,506
Ha! Ha!

1494
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,942
Mom!
Okay, we're happy!

1495
01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:23,577
Yes.

1496
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:25,546
Yes!

1497
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,454
My daughter was a surprise.

1498
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,062
I'm gonna have to sell my house.

1499
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:45,799
Get something bigger,
with carpets.

1500
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:48,569
I've gotta tell Jacob.

1501
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:50,871
I can't believe
dad's not around.

1502
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,640
Well, I'm around. So...

1503
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:55,209
I'm here.

1504
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,611
Yeah, I know. I know.

1505
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,416
Hello?

1506
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:05,285
<i>Hey, it's Anna
in Dr. Seagal's office.</i>

1507
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,887
<i>It's negative.</i>

1508
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:10,057
Really?

1509
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,825
What about all those tests
that I took?

1510
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:14,328
<i>I don't know, but we tested
your blood and urine,</i>

1511
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,930
<i>and you're not pregnant.</i>

1512
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:19,433
Okay. Well, thanks
for calling.

1513
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,337
I don't understand.
Google says here,

1514
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:29,109
that "a false positive could be
certain types of stomach tumors."

1515
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:31,245
Do you feel sick?

1516
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:34,615
Maybe you could ask the
doctor to test your blood

1517
01:27:34,617 --> 01:27:37,251
for other things like aids.
I don't have aids.

1518
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,286
Well, I said "like" aids.

1519
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,127
I don't get it.
It says here,

1520
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:52,466
"if you have two lines, then
it means you're ovu... lating."

1521
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:02,309
I've been peeing
on ovulation sticks?

1522
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:03,777
What the hell?

1523
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,080
You bought me ovulation sticks!

1524
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:10,183
You understand
what you just put me through?

1525
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:13,487
I thought I was pregnant, and
then stomach tumors, and then...

1526
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:15,589
Oh, my...

1527
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:21,795
Oh, my god.

1528
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:27,601
Oh, my god!

1529
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:36,977
Lor, I wasn't laughing at you.

1530
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,578
Oh, honey.

1531
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:42,082
It's better anyway.
You didn't plan it, right?

1532
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:44,351
Right?
I know, I just...

1533
01:28:44,353 --> 01:28:50,057
I was so relieved to have
that decision made for me.

1534
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:52,492
Yeah.

1535
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,028
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

1536
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:57,030
For what, sweetie?

1537
01:28:57,032 --> 01:28:58,598
For the way I am.

1538
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,901
I love the way you are.

1539
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:04,705
I just...
I just really miss him.

1540
01:29:04,707 --> 01:29:07,307
You know, maybe he's not
the guy for you.

1541
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:09,309
No, not Jacob.

1542
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:11,912
I miss dad.

1543
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:14,314
I miss my dad.

1544
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:15,515
Yeah, me too.

1545
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:20,854
You know, it's really hard
to look at you sometimes.

1546
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,122
Why?

1547
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:26,360
Because half the room's missing.

1548
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:29,396
And we're both alone.

1549
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:31,131
We're not alone.

1550
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:32,999
You're not alone.

1551
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:48,849
This is what you get for following
the black sheep across the country.

1552
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:51,618
Well, if you're black sheep,
then I'm a black sheep.

1553
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,088
We're two black sheeps.

1554
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:39,533
It's me.

1555
01:31:12,234 --> 01:31:13,733
It's ringing.

1556
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:20,974
<i>Hello?</i>

1557
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:27,647
Ma?

1558
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:31,618
Hi.

1559
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,920
Thank you.

1560
01:31:33,922 --> 01:31:35,055
Hey...

1561
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:38,692
Hi. I didn't know...

1562
01:32:33,815 --> 01:32:36,650
Joey, I don't know
what you want, but...

1563
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,954
This is all I can do.

1564
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,128
Ma'am!

1565
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:49,863
You gotta be kidding me.

1566
01:32:49,865 --> 01:32:52,098
What is that you're doing
down there?

1567
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,533
Nothing!

1568
01:32:53,535 --> 01:32:56,202
Ma'am, it's illegal
to be doing what you're doing.

1569
01:32:56,204 --> 01:32:58,238
I need you to step
out of the water, okay?

1570
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:03,176
I'm a resident
of greater Los Angeles,

1571
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:05,345
and if you want me
to get out of this ocean,

1572
01:33:05,347 --> 01:33:09,015
you're just gonna have to come
in and drag me the hell out!

1573
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:14,087
You think about who
your one phone call is.

1574
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,528
Well, thank you very much.

1575
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:31,765
It was my absolute pleasure.

1576
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:33,433
Here, I'll take that.
Yeah.

1577
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:40,440
Um...

1578
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,411
Do you ever listen to Beyoncé?

1579
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,379
'Course.

1580
01:34:46,381 --> 01:34:49,115
Yeah, you know, she has
this song, "I was here."

1581
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:52,719
Do you know that one?
I don't think I do.

1582
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:54,187
Well, it goes,

1583
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:58,558
"I wanna leave my footprints
in the sands of time.

1584
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,427
"Know that I left
something behind.

1585
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:05,065
"When I leave this world,
I leave no regrets.

1586
01:35:05,067 --> 01:35:07,434
"To know I left something
to remember,

1587
01:35:07,436 --> 01:35:09,102
so they won't forget."

1588
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:13,873
That sounds like a good one.
Yeah.

1589
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,877
Well, um...

1590
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:24,150
When you bailed me out,
did you do that

1591
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:27,987
because you're
an officer of the law?

1592
01:35:27,989 --> 01:35:31,357
No, that's actually the
opposite of what I usually do.

1593
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,096
I bailed you out as a friend.

1594
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,437
Um...

1595
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:51,244
You wanna go
to an action movie sometime?

1596
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:54,981
Definitely.

1597
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,368
<i>Mom, where are you?</i>

1598
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,236
<i>You left in the middle
of the night and I got worried.</i>

1599
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:52,939
<i>Are you okay? Can you call
me when you get this?</i>

1600
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:54,240
<i>Love you.</i>

1601
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:58,678
<i>Hey, it's me.
I hope you're not mad at me.</i>

1602
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,548
<i>Maybe just text me and let
me know that you got this.</i>

1603
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,550
<i>Okay, love you.</i>

1604
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:08,288
<i>Okay, I'm officially worried.
Where are you?</i>

1605
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:11,324
<i>Call me. This is weird.
This is your daughter.</i>

1606
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,762
<i>Hey, Marnie, it's Jillian.</i>

1607
01:37:15,764 --> 01:37:18,264
<i>I was wondering if you could
watch Tehya for me today.</i>

1608
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:21,334
<i>Dani and I have
a thing at 7:00.</i>

1609
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,870
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.
Dani, we're leaving.

1610
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:28,107
Grandma Marnie's here!
Here she is. Here's my girl!

1611
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:33,413
Guess what? We're gonna get
to play all night.

1612
01:37:33,415 --> 01:37:35,315
Oh, bye.
She's so sad to leave us.

1613
01:37:35,317 --> 01:37:37,817
- She's distraught.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1614
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:40,887
Well, we're matching.
This is like the second time.

1615
01:37:40,889 --> 01:37:45,058
What should we do?
How about a story?

1616
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,861
Okay.
Yes, would you like that?

1617
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,557
<i>Hey, it's Lori.
Leave a message.</i>

1618
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,060
Anyways,
I just thought I'd check in

1619
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:22,495
and see what you're up to

1620
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:24,330
and how your date
went last night

1621
01:38:24,332 --> 01:38:26,866
or whatever it is you
wanted me to call it.

1622
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:30,103
I don't know how much longer I'm
going to have cell phone reception

1623
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:33,239
'cause I'm going to Topanga to
see my friend with the chickens.

1624
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:37,610
And then, a Jason Statham
movie... his new movie,

1625
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:40,113
the one where he plays
the guy who stops time.

1626
01:38:40,115 --> 01:38:42,882
It looks fabulous.

1627
01:38:42,884 --> 01:38:46,052
And then tomorrow,
I told Jillian

1628
01:38:46,054 --> 01:38:47,887
that I would babysit for Tehya,

1629
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:50,857
so I'll be in the neighborhood, if
you want me to bring by bagels,

1630
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:54,594
or look at whatever you're working
on or whatever, you know.

1631
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:57,163
Because next weekend, I think
I'm gonna go to the desert.

1632
01:38:57,165 --> 01:38:58,998
I'm thinking... I don't know...

1633
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,667
If I'll actually stay the night,

1634
01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:05,038
but I'm thinking I'd maybe
like to see the desert.

1635
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,673
I mean, it's right there, right?

1636
01:39:06,675 --> 01:39:08,975
Anyway, call me.

1637
01:39:08,977 --> 01:39:10,376
Love you!

1638
01:39:13,715 --> 01:39:15,415
Oh...
