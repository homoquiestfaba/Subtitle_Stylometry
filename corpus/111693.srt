1
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,769
The heat wave continues.
It's 109 degrees in Los Angeles.

2
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:46,363
As drought-ridden Los Angeles
swelters in agonising heat...

3
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,683
...drug lords wage warfare in the streets.

4
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:52,402
Yet another open conflict...
Oh, fuck this! Get me out of here!

5
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,165
Argh!

6
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:06,613
We're in a war zone, Dave: Two motorcycle
officers horribly wounded in a crossfire...

7
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:11,403
...the police seemingly unable to rescue them
in spite of several desperate, heroic attempts.

8
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,371
It's completely out of control down here.

9
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:24,168
My beautiful cantina,
everything I own, they shot it to pieces.

10
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:27,529
My microwave,
my automatic steamer, my grill...

11
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,649
You fucking ¡pendejos!

12
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,801
Ah! Ha-ha!

13
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:03,808
Fuck you!

14
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:10,208
Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene and in your face.

15
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:11,931
It's like Dante's hell.

16
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,089
Smoke, fire, oppressive heat...

17
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:19,805
...as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends
again transform LA into a slaughterhouse.

18
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:23,568
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops? Uh-uh.

19
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,486
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

20
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,406
Mr Mayor,
on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe...

21
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:32,690
...get off your butt,
get down here and declare martial law!

22
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:00,203
OK, don't keep me in suspense, Danny boy!

23
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,488
It has not been a nice day!

24
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:07,124
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

25
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:11,252
You know, ten Colombians
and Scorpios armed to fuck all.

26
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,642
They're trying to get in their headquarters.

27
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,442
We're keeping them pinned down,
but those officers are bleeding to death.

28
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:20,212
Fuck! They're dying, man.

29
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,489
Where the hell is Special Weapons?

30
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:27,327
They're still tied up in that shootout
in San Pedro with the Jamaicans.

31
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,005
They shot down a chopper.

32
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:33,245
Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
We need an assault vehicle to go get 'em.

33
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,403
I'm gonna chat with these assholes.

34
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:38,530
- When I give the signal, give me some cover!
- Got it!

35
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,124
Too small.

36
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:58,848
Right.

37
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:34,451
Come on! Come on!

38
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,247
Get 'em out of here! Now!

39
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:45,686
¡Vámonos!

40
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,611
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

41
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:08,084
- ¡Vámonos!
- ¡Vámonos!

42
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:31,605
Hey, assholes!

43
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,005
Mike, are you OK?

44
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,649
- Yeah. Let's get the rest.
- We can't. Orders from Chief Heinemann.

45
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,088
He says surround building and wait.

46
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,004
- Wait for what?
- I don't know!

47
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:04,403
Some bullshit special unit. The feds, the DEA.

48
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,883
If we let those bastards get dug in now,
we'll have to level the building!

49
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:09,973
- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mí.

50
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:12,248
- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mí.

51
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,812
¡Vámonos! ¡Vámonos!

52
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,690
¡Venga! ¡Aprisa!

53
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,610
¡Venga!

54
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,690
¡Chíngale! ¡Chíngale!

55
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:31,006
Come and get it. El Scorpio is ready.

56
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,721
- Sarge, any of your people in the building?
- No.

57
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,246
Let's go.

58
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,211
Lieutenant, can't let you in.
Heinemann's on his way.

59
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,682
Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass! Come on!

60
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,644
Goddamn it. Go with him.

61
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,408
Three, two, one...

62
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:24,085
Go!

63
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,205
Shh. Shh.

64
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,085
Get back, back, back. Back.

65
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,765
Shh.

66
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:38,644
Next door over.

67
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:56,771
Take this room!

68
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:03,088
First floor, officer down. We need backup.

69
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,685
Freeze!

70
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,411
I said hold it!

71
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:29,486
Now, lay your guns down.
You can walk down or fly, it's your choice.

72
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,124
I said put it down, asshole!

73
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,083
No!

74
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,683
- Ohh!
- Let's do it now!

75
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:03,367
Take it easy.

76
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:09,126
Damn, it's hot.

77
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,845
Must be losing it.

78
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,451
Mike!

79
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:42,001
Spread out. Secure the roof.

80
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:44,971
Just take it easy. I'm right here.

81
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,083
All clear. All clear on the site.

82
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,403
Oh, Danny boy.

83
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,885
I gotta get down from here.

84
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,289
Shit.

85
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:01,286
OK, search the roof.
Check every floor. Maybe someone else...

86
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:03,841
Seal it off. No one leaves.

87
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,367
Danny, get me off this damn roof.

88
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,570
- You get the rest of them?
- Somebody beat us to it.

89
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:24,611
Leona.

90
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,004
Oh, shit.

91
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,210
- What happened to El Scorpio?
- He's out front having lunch.

92
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:06,204
What the hell is this?

93
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,885
I don't know.

94
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:09,850
They've been cut to pieces.

95
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,972
- Must be the Jamaicans.
- Their style, but where the hell did they go?

96
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:18,365
OK, nobody gets in here
until Forensic arrives. Nobody.

97
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:19,966
OK, you know the drill.

98
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:48,847
Mike.

99
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:51,564
Up there.

100
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,924
He must have been killed out here,
and then someone...

101
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:07,930
That's about 35, 40 feet. No rope, no ladder.

102
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,403
The guy weighs about 190, 195 pounds.

103
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:13,290
You couldn't carry him up there.

104
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:16,331
Lieutenant?

105
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:20,326
Deputy Chief Heinemann's downstairs.
He wants you out of the building now.

106
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,324
Ah, son of a bitch.

107
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,489
What the fuck is going on?

108
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,371
This is not good, Mike.
Not good at all.

109
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,525
- I want a real name on this joker, OK?
- You got it.

110
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,205
Mike.

111
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:42,332
Phil, this is quite a surprise.
What brings you down from the palace?

112
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:46,322
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

113
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,482
I thought we had an understanding.

114
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:51,848
I put my ass on the line to get you here...

115
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,527
...and all I expect is a little cooperation!

116
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,649
You were told this was a federal matter.

117
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,293
Yet you disobeyed an order
to stay out of the building.

118
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,570
Don't let this get out, Phil,
but it's a fucking war down here.

119
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,852
Soldiers take orders. Don't push it!

120
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:11,528
I'll push it as far as I can, Phil,
cos we're fighting for our lives here...

121
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:15,128
...while you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!

122
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,412
I don't roll over for anybody,
especially the feds...

123
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,688
...without a goddamn good explanation!

124
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:48,728
Take this equipment up to the third floor.
Come on, let's move!

125
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,289
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

126
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:04,887
What the hell is going on here, Heinemann?

127
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:09,364
Insubordination. Disregard for direct orders
from a supervising officer.

128
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,728
Now get back to your cage at Alvarado.

129
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:15,408
- I'll show you insubordination, you son of...
- No, no, no!

130
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,245
Where you running to? Come here!

131
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,052
You don't need this, Mike. It's not worth it.

132
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,851
Relax.

133
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,651
Oh, fuck!

134
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:44,605
I have an update for you.

135
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,924
In a shootout, five members
of one Colombian drug gang...

136
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,086
...were ambushed by their bloody rivals,
the Jamaican Voodoo Posse...

137
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:56,371
...who escaped without a trace - ha! -
again making total fools of...

138
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:59,092
- A detective is here to see you.
- Back there.

139
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:03,451
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

140
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:08,323
- This licence has expired.
- Bullshit! I paid that fee six months ago.

141
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:11,166
- I'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

142
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:14,404
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

143
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,004
What you lookin' at?

144
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,645
And all you got to do...

145
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,611
...is tee it high and let it fly.

146
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,006
Ow! Dead solid perfect.

147
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:33,689
Now, remember, for distance
you gotta gently but firmly grip the club.

148
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:37,090
Lieutenant Harrigan!
Detective Lambert, Rampart Division.

149
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,085
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

150
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,250
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start, Mike.

151
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,121
Heinemann's already been up my ass so far
I won't be able to sit down for a week.

152
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,965
We're not winning this war.

153
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,886
As much as it'll piss you off,
you'll have to play the game.

154
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:55,929
"Effective immediately, a federal task force
under Special Agent Peter Keyes...

155
00:16:56,013 --> 00:17:02,486
...will investigate criminal activities involving
the trafficking of controlled substances."

156
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,610
And you will extend him
your full cooperation.

157
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:08,605
So you're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

158
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,730
The feds are calling the shots on this.
My hands are tied!

159
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,564
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

160
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:18,882
- It's good to meet you.
- And you, sir.

161
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:22,363
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

162
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,082
Heard a lot about you.

163
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:28,290
I'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion.

164
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,251
Don't mean to be stepping on your toes.

165
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:36,327
But we want to prevent King Willie's voodoo
gangs from taking over the entire West Coast.

166
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,169
I wish I could tell you more.

167
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,689
But we have a large number
of deep-cover operatives involved.

168
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:47,768
You know how it is. We all have ajob to do.

169
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:52,929
Now, I'm sure we can respect
each other's situation and act responsibly.

170
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,251
Well...

171
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,449
...um, cooperation...

172
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:00,764
...is my middle name.

173
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,084
I'll see you around.

174
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:19,850
- I'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like I said, have a seat. I'll be right with you.

175
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,493
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

176
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,970
All right, Danny boy, what we got?

177
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:30,807
What have we got? Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

178
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,691
The next minute... they're all shish kebab.

179
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,411
Not one bullet wound.

180
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,053
It wasn't drugs or money.
There's a shitload of that.

181
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:42,331
Maybe King Willie brought in some
outside talent. He's making his big move.

182
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,608
A pro would have split
the moment he heard us.

183
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,763
More than one, we would have seen them.

184
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,970
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute...

185
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:54,046
...and then took out four men
armed with machine guns by hand!

186
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,328
And then got by us.

187
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:59,564
Maybe we should give him ajob.
Let's put him on the payroll.

188
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,443
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

189
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,922
- You gotta... You gotta hear this.
- What?!

190
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,402
Hey. Hey, I forgot to tell you.

191
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,131
See that guy there?

192
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,124
That's Ferris's replacement.

193
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:17,287
This guy's Jerry Lambert.
The Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

194
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,091
That's the Lone Ranger?

195
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:21,971
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

196
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:25,204
I said "Lady, you are under arrest."
And she said "Why?"

197
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:28,490
I said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him."

198
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:31,487
- Know what she said, didn't miss a beat?
- Uh, no.

199
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:36,089
She said "I stabbed that son of a bitch
plenty of times. He never died on me before."

200
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:39,487
Oh-oh.

201
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:43,725
Looks like he's putting the moves to Leona.

202
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,531
His first big mistake.

203
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:50,645
I have heard about you.

204
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,405
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

205
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:55,690
- Like your last partner got shot.
- What?

206
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:56,808
Well...

207
00:19:56,893 --> 00:20:00,044
- Oy!
- You try that cowboy shit with me, fucker...

208
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,328
...you can kiss these goodbye.

209
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,362
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it. Unhh!

210
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:09,366
Well, well, I see that
the three of you have met.

211
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:13,125
Lambert, if you're feeling up to it...

212
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,967
...why don't you limp your way in
to the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

213
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:18,486
Yeah.

214
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:20,689
Aauughh!

215
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:23,128
- You're a bad girl.
- Ooh, I like that.

216
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:24,328
No, no, no!

217
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:28,009
Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag or what?

218
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:37,130
This is what I call "the speech", kid.
I only give it once, so pay attention.

219
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:42,367
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, dunking doughnuts.

220
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:46,603
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

221
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,524
Lieutenant, I've paid my dues.

222
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,968
I had to bust my ass to get my transfer.

223
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,203
And that scares the shit out of me, kid.

224
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,853
No one requests to come here
unless they want a reputation.

225
00:20:55,933 --> 00:21:00,563
There's no room for anyone looking
to prove themselves. I won't stand for it.

226
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:05,363
Don't get me wrong. We need good cops,
and they say you're good at what you do.

227
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,648
But the team comes first.

228
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,567
You live by that, and you'll be OK.
And we'll all be there for you.

229
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:14,247
Remember, the door swings both ways.

230
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,604
That's it.

231
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,009
Hey, kid.

232
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,325
Welcome to the war.

233
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:45,924
No!

234
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:55,250
OK, guys.
This has gone too far now, huh?

235
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,684
Hey, hey, guys.

236
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:02,087
I- I-I know you're trying to scare me, huh?

237
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:07,008
Well, you did a pretty good job, man.

238
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,004
I'm scared now.

239
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,725
Stop it now.

240
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:13,725
I can pay you.

241
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:16,566
$2 million, man. In cash.

242
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:19,406
- Right now!
- This is not about money.

243
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:22,613
This is about power!

244
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:25,569
There's a new king in the streets.

245
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:28,884
This is a message he has for your people.

246
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,884
You are history.

247
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,771
Fucking history, goddamn puto.

248
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,361
What the fuck are you doing now, man?

249
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:47,364
You're crazy!

250
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,644
King Willie says...

251
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:52,604
...not only do I have to kill you...

252
00:22:57,213 --> 00:23:00,250
...but I have to take your soul.

253
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,328
Voodoo magic.

254
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:08,881
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

255
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:15,882
But you know what? I tell you what I believe.

256
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,444
Shit happens.

257
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:32,487
Argh!

258
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,805
Shoot it!

259
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:00,932
Argh!

260
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,332
Fucker!

261
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:13,125
Aargh!

262
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,567
Sh... shit happens.

263
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,564
Shit happens.

264
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,684
Aah!

265
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:51,487
I'm standing just outside
a penthouse complex in San Pedro...

266
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,690
...involving as many as 20 people.
It's uncertain who they were.

267
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:58,288
One report indicates it might be
the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

268
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:03,367
I go in for my physical and the doctor says
"I need a semen, stool and urine sample."

269
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:07,332
I say "Gee, doc, I'm in a big hurry.
Can I just leave my underwear?"

270
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,051
Oh, God.

271
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:11,490
Achtung, mein Kapitän!

272
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:15,043
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

273
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,771
Oh, man, it's Pope.

274
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:18,809
That parasite must live in his car.

275
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,123
I'll handle it. PR's my specialty.

276
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:23,843
Word is they want your ass off the job.

277
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,764
- Tony!
- Who the hell are you?

278
00:25:25,853 --> 00:25:28,447
Your biggest fan!
Catch your show all the time.

279
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:31,605
- I got ajob to do!
- Yourjob is to root for garbage elsewhere.

280
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:34,765
- Been inside?
- Yeah. We were gonna go in with our guys...

281
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:39,051
...but we were told on a radio transmission
nobody goes in under any circumstances.

282
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:44,253
All units, be advised.
Federal officers will handle investigation.

283
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,245
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

284
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,722
This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...

285
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:53,041
Hey, nice flashlight. Mind if I borrow it?

286
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,851
OK.

287
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,645
Damn!

288
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,612
Look familiar?

289
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:18,967
Aah!

290
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,212
Fuck.

291
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:23,488
Oh, God.

292
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:27,002
Ramon Vega, the crack king.

293
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:29,607
Biggest operator in East LA. 100 keys a week.

294
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:34,562
- Why isn't he skinned? And who are they?
- Jamaicans. King Willie's boys.

295
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:36,245
That makes no sense.

296
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,962
This was a voodoo ritual.
I've seen it before. They took his heart out.

297
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:42,283
- What for?
- Terror tactics, man.

298
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,251
You know,
to scare the shit out of their enemies.

299
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:48,492
- King Willie.
- Who the hell is King Willie?

300
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,805
King Willie, voodoo priest of the LA posses.

301
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:55,930
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica...

302
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,924
...till he got too powerful.

303
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:00,925
The Jamaican chiefs
won't make a move without his approval.

304
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:02,890
So what the fuck happened?

305
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,565
Shit!

306
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,484
Hey, we got a survivor!

307
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,884
What's she saying?

308
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:22,007
I don't know. She's not making any sense.

309
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:26,450
She keeps saying "El diablo vino por ellos."
The devil came for them.

310
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:31,812
If it's the Colombians, why'd they leave their
boss hanging and his girl naked on the floor?

311
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:34,691
- It wasn't the Colombians.
- Our friend from the armoury.

312
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,809
Right.

313
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:38,804
We got a new player in town.

314
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,243
Come over here, Mike. Check this out.

315
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,211
What is that?

316
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:52,043
Looks like a spear tip or something.

317
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,564
This is a restricted area.

318
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,883
I want it cleared immediately.

319
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:58,884
You're walking on physical evidence.

320
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:01,809
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me.

321
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:05,283
Lieutenant, I'd like
a word with you in private, please.

322
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:13,369
They say that persistence
is your most outstanding quality.

323
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:16,206
- I know this is your show...
- You're not listening to me!

324
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:19,684
You got a big nose and
you're sticking it too far in my business.

325
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:22,651
Maybe you can hear this.
The next time you cross me...

326
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,531
...you're gonna turn up missing.

327
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:29,603
- Garber, the man with the camera. Get him.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,924
- All right. Let's go.
- Stay away.

329
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:36,323
- Hey, fuck you, man! Give me my camera!
- Shut the fuck up.

330
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:39,325
Hey, wait a minute!
I got my rights! I'm ajournalist.

331
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:42,325
- Harrigan! Harrigan!
- Shut up. Let's go.

332
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:45,850
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

333
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,322
Take him out of the building. Search him.

334
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,008
Now you get the hell out of here.

335
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,645
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

336
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:59,043
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

337
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:14,411
Wanna make me proud, kid?

338
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:17,963
Take your bag of tricks, stay with them,
find out where they take her.

339
00:29:18,053 --> 00:29:21,728
Meet me later at La Cita's.
And be careful. These guys are good.

340
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:24,611
Hey, don't worry!
Surveillance is my specialty.

341
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:27,127
OK, then. Just get going.

342
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,125
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

343
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,325
Danny, look here. We gotta take this real cool.

344
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:39,122
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

345
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:42,728
You stick around, stay out of sight.
I'll meet you at one o'clock.

346
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:47,125
We'll take a good look at that room, OK?
Hey, wait for me.

347
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:50,207
Danny boy,
no hero stuff, understand?

348
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,249
Dan-Dan-Danny boy.

349
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,723
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

350
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:06,690
She never made it.

351
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,765
The feds were waiting.

352
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:11,084
Hustled her off in a chopper.

353
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:15,051
- Let me guess. A silver Alouette?
- That very one.

354
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:21,607
And guess what. Your pal Keyes was
running the whole show. And his butt boys.

355
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:23,924
Son of a bitch.

356
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,890
You done real good, kid.

357
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:29,161
Now tomorrow, start a tail on Keyes.

358
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,562
Everything he does, everywhere he goes.

359
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:33,564
Who knows? You mightjust get lucky.

360
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:35,652
Lieutenant!

361
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,212
Luck...

362
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,204
...is my specialty.

363
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,529
Yeah. I bet it is.

364
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,768
Now, if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant,
I got some serious police work to attend to.

365
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:55,124
Come to Papa.

366
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,208
Hey!

367
00:30:57,293 --> 00:30:59,853
- Hey, are your balls OK?
- Fine.

368
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,810
How are yours?

369
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,282
- Hey, do you mind? It's my sister.
- Say what?

370
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:06,091
Oh, you're not my sister.

371
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:12,765
Son of a bitch.
Who are you really chasing, Keyes?

372
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,724
Time to go to work.

373
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:38,368
- Shit.
- Danny boy.

374
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,804
Mike? Whoa!

375
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,241
Whoa!

376
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,081
Oh, God!

377
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,086
No. No. Oh, God!

378
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,927
Oh, Mother of God!

379
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,247
Please, no!

380
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,688
Oh! Aargh!

381
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,727
Lieutenant Michael R Harrigan:

382
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:16,249
...violence prone,
obsessive/compulsive personality...

383
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,052
...a history of excessive physical force...

384
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:23,843
...throughout his 18 years
as a Los Angeles police officer.

385
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:29,212
Also responsible for the destruction of
11 patrol cars, a city bus...

386
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,443
What about ten commendations for valour...

387
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:35,924
...and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

388
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:41,087
That and my intervention on your behalf
are the only reasons you still have ajob.

389
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:46,566
If it were up to the chief, he'd charge you with
Detective Archuleta's death and suspend you.

390
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:51,329
As it is, he left it in my hands.

391
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:57,481
Now, this John Wayne attitude and flagrant
disregard for policy is gonna end now.

392
00:35:58,013 --> 00:36:01,801
No one under my command will impede
the progress of this federal task force...

393
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,804
...headed by Agent Keyes.

394
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:06,124
No one.

395
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:13,849
That's it.

396
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,844
Dismissed.

397
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:25,768
Mike, you're too close to this. Stay out of it.

398
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:28,890
It's a police matter.
They can't keep the department out of it.

399
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,168
We'll find Danny's killer.

400
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:33,972
Captain, Danny and I came up together.

401
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,123
15 years on the fucking street!

402
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,844
Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
I'm gonna finish it.

403
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,645
Hey!

404
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,084
Hey, come on. What is this?

405
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:01,804
Listen, shithead.

406
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:06,284
I don't give a fuck what you want with
this asshole because now it's personal.

407
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:07,931
And he's a dead man.

408
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:11,085
What you're dealing with
is over your head. I'm warning you...

409
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:14,131
You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.

410
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:16,966
And I'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out of my way!

411
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,328
- I'll take care of him.
- No.

412
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:34,283
Let him go.

413
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:36,489
We're too close.

414
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:45,331
...claiming as his, turf controlled
by the Jamaican and Colombian drug lords.

415
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,881
Watch as we continue our report.

416
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:51,446
Yes, the word is out: LA is up for grabs...

417
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,445
...the spoils of our once fine city
going to the ruthless scum...

418
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:57,969
...who can spread the most
carnage and blood in our streets.

419
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:00,044
The latest update on the scoreboard:

420
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,852
...five assorted trash and one good cop...

421
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,651
...one of the best on our force.

422
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:07,691
Who's next? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...

423
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:09,684
Forget it. It's over.

424
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:14,446
Mike, goddamn it.
This ain't your personal little war, you know.

425
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,171
I loved Danny, too.

426
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:19,962
Hey, you told me the only way
you survive is because you're a team.

427
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:22,408
The door swings both ways. Remember?

428
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,203
All right. We'll do it together.

429
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:33,769
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

430
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:38,132
- We've been on him for the last three days.
- And they're not looking for drug dealers.

431
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:41,683
Yeah. They've been setting up
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

432
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:44,207
I used my whole repertory
to keep up with them!

433
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:47,645
I had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

434
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,849
They had equipment I can't begin to touch.

435
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,004
And then this morning...

436
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:55,121
...I lost 'em.
- We lost them.

437
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,204
- Where?
- Vernon and Industry.

438
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,126
- They disappeared!
- The slaughterhouse district?

439
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,444
Yeah, and in this heat, whoo!
I mean, BO and barbecue!

440
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:06,525
Whatever Keyes is looking for,
he's found it, or close to it.

441
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:08,804
Leona, I want to meet with King Willie.

442
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:11,361
Willie and I seem to have the same problem.

443
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:15,170
- In the meantime, you come with me.
- Mike, it's impossible!

444
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,164
Just do it.

445
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:20,844
Fuck!

446
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,402
Omega 1. This is Control.

447
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:26,245
This is Omega 1.

448
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:29,730
We only have 22 minutes
on safe window of operation.

449
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:33,408
- Yes, sir.
- Verify that final telemetry check.

450
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:35,211
Start your test now.

451
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,853
Scan track three, two, one...

452
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,002
...mark.

453
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:41,766
Number six,
power up on the UV banks.

454
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:46,652
We're complete
on the lower UV banks. Ready for testing.

455
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:49,531
Second level,
check for ambient temperature variations.

456
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,649
You got two minutes. Now get going.

457
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:58,129
To all units. All units, you have
approximately 20 minutes to finish your task.

458
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,324
- Roger.
- Increase this UV.

459
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:02,324
Up 42 per cent.

460
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:09,088
Your friend died as
the result of an intrusion in the chest cavity...

461
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,643
...by an edged weapon
that nearly cleaved the heart in two.

462
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,724
Death was instantaneous.

463
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,886
He was boned like a fish.
I've never seen anything like this.

464
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:21,604
Please, do not touch anything.

465
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,212
Doctor, what about the other victims?

466
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,092
Anything there?

467
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:33,006
The federal team
brought in their own forensic examiners.

468
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:36,608
I am the medical examiner
and the chief pathologist in the city...

469
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:38,331
...and they've cut me out.

470
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:41,644
Any way you can get a look at evidence
the feds have collected?

471
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:45,646
- I mean, they must have run tests.
- It won't be easy.

472
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,724
Doctor...

473
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:51,328
...I pried this from Danny's hands.
This is what took him into the rafters.

474
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:54,962
- It has almost no weight.
- But it cuts like steel.

475
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,771
Let me see.

476
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:03,768
We are now at 150,000 times
normal magnification.

477
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:13,212
Astonishing. This material doesn't
correspond to anything on the periodic table.

478
00:41:14,613 --> 00:41:18,811
- Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?
- Don't know. It's not from a hardware store.

479
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,929
- Military?
- Uh, good guess.

480
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:23,686
Either something that got away,
or something they want.

481
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,765
Keyes. Ah, we're getting closer now
to what happened...

482
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:29,605
Hey, no!

483
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:31,729
Easy, kid. Put your gun away.

484
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:33,724
King Willie will see you now.

485
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:38,851
I'm tired of the rat race, I wanna have fun...

486
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,889
- It's OK.
- Don't you want me with you?

487
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:42,725
I'll call you later.

488
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:46,328
- You want me to follow you?
- I'll call you later!

489
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,484
I can't take my mind off my problems...

490
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,609
You want some ganja, man?

491
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:54,761
License plate number.

492
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:56,286
1-8-8...

493
00:41:56,373 --> 00:41:58,045
No, no. 1-8-8-3...

494
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,044
Oh, fuck!

495
00:42:08,933 --> 00:42:11,288
The door swings both ways, my ass.

496
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:13,689
This door swings both ways.

497
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,924
Thanks for the ride.

498
00:42:32,893 --> 00:42:34,212
You know...

499
00:42:34,613 --> 00:42:36,843
...you guys really ought to cut down.

500
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:22,046
They say you want to talk to me.

501
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:26,604
They say you offering me favours.

502
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:32,208
Tell me why, Babylon.

503
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:34,488
Mr Policeman.

504
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:38,927
- I want some information.
- Information.

505
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:40,765
Hm.

506
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,769
About the one that's doing all the killing?

507
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:46,809
He killed your people.

508
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:48,804
Now mine.

509
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:51,571
I think you know who he is.

510
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:53,883
I want him.

511
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:58,690
I don't know who he is.

512
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:02,810
But I know where he is.

513
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:07,250
- The other side.
- What are you talking about?

514
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,971
The spirit world, man.

515
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:11,965
You see...

516
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:13,964
...it's always the same.

517
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,611
There's no stopping what can't be stopped.

518
00:44:18,693 --> 00:44:21,332
No killing what can't be killed.

519
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:23,449
Hey, make sense, man.

520
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:27,242
This thing
that's killing your people and mine...

521
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,324
...is from the other side.

522
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:32,211
I can feel him all around.

523
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:35,603
You can't see the eyes of the demon...

524
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:39,452
...until him come calling.

525
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:43,048
This is dread, man.

526
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:45,044
Truly dread.

527
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:54,846
Nothing else for you here, policeman.

528
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,844
Time to go.

529
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,404
Prepare yourself.

530
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:18,172
"His foundation lie in the holy mountain."

531
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:19,807
"Selah."

532
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:22,771
Aargh!

533
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:11,128
This is Tony Pope live from LA...

534
00:47:11,213 --> 00:47:12,441
...the city of fear.

535
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:16,162
The psycho-vigilante killer
continues his daily diet for murder.

536
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,845
Bodies strung out...

537
00:47:17,933 --> 00:47:21,687
...bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.

538
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:24,446
And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord...

539
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:27,809
...the vicious drug lord found
in an alley just around the corner...

540
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:31,727
...with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.

541
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:34,486
A fitting demise
to the Prince of Powder.

542
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:41,563
First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!

543
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:44,885
He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.

544
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,601
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes?

545
00:47:47,893 --> 00:47:51,852
- Anything there?
- Definitely something slippery about Keyes.

546
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,288
Seems there's a Peter J Keyes.

547
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,933
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

548
00:47:57,413 --> 00:48:01,122
Hot out of college
and into the Strategic Defense Institute.

549
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:05,172
Then two years later commissioned
as a captain in Air Force Intelligence.

550
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,847
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

551
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:12,449
Look, I don't care who's involved.
This guy killed Danny and he's going to fall!

552
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:16,690
- What about the good doctor?
- I'm here, Lieutenant.

553
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:21,130
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this:

554
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:25,684
...part of a chemical test
on a fragment of wood from the penthouse.

555
00:48:25,773 --> 00:48:27,491
And it contained traces...

556
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:31,532
...of cattle blood and heavy traces of steroids.

557
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:37,210
I believe whoever killed Detective Archuleta
had recently been in a slaughterhouse.

558
00:48:37,293 --> 00:48:39,727
That's where I lost Keyes the first time!

559
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:41,690
Yeah. That's where we'll find him.

560
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:45,129
Take the metro.
I'll pick you up at Vernon station in an hour.

561
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,762
Just because you don't see Keyes's boys
doesn't mean they're not around.

562
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:11,323
I just want you to stay in the car. OK?

563
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:15,292
Your mom and I won't be very long.
You sit still. We'll be back in a few minutes.

564
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:17,284
All right?

565
00:49:17,813 --> 00:49:19,963
- Come on, honey.
- Yes, darling.

566
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:21,964
- Which way was it?
- Down here.

567
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:29,449
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

568
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:54,284
Want some candy?

569
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,563
Brian? Brian!

570
00:49:58,653 --> 00:50:01,326
- You come here right this minute!
- Mommy, I saw a ghost.

571
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:04,325
Want some candy?
Want some candy?

572
00:50:22,374 --> 00:50:24,285
Rest.

573
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:31,006
Want some candy?

574
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:29,925
Danny's necklace.

575
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:34,524
I hate the subway at rush hour.

576
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:40,003
It's hard enough to find a seat, and if you do,
someone's pissed in it or thrown up over it.

577
00:51:40,094 --> 00:51:42,608
This damn heat is killing me, man.

578
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,532
Hey, it's me!

579
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:47,003
- I look great!
- Oh, shut up.

580
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:48,527
No autographs, Pop.

581
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:48,527
No autographs, Pop.
