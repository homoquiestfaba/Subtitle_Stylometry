1
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:24,121
( Match strikes )

2
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:38,367
Eh... being back here
reminds me of...

3
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,535
When we met.

4
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:42,870
Dude,
we met at that, um...

5
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,172
No, man.

6
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:47,541
Friggin'...
Jessica?

7
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,176
Yeah, Jessica. D'uh.

8
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,611
Dude, I just think
you need to stop going
out to bars.

9
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:55,280
I think you need
to shut the fuck up,

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,049
sit down, relax,

11
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,683
and listen to my shit.

12
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:01,951
So you gonna listen
to my shit or what?

13
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,552
All right, all right.

14
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:06,588
Let's hear this shit.
Please, tell me.

15
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,990
Okay.

16
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,157
Well...

17
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,726
It started...

18
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,096
Over there.

19
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:18,730
I was, uh...

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,965
Hanging out with a couple
of logging buddies, right?

21
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:24,401
It had been a long day.

22
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,102
Lookin' around,
seein' couples,

23
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:29,538
single girls, single guys,

24
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,039
all on a mission.

25
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,540
Okay, so...

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,708
How many more beers
before the girl walks in?

27
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,643
Oh, plenty.

28
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:39,345
Many, many, many,
many beers.

29
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:40,512
(Chuckles)

30
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:42,880
Anyway, this girl...

31
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:46,850
She was...

32
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,952
Not from around here.

33
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:52,921
She was classy.

34
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,723
Elegant.

35
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:59,326
Mnh. There's not many
of those around here.

36
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:01,061
No shit, Sherlock.

37
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,164
And if I wasn't ice-skating
uphill enough already,

38
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:07,467
I didn't have a fuckin'
dollar to my name, man.

39
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:11,204
I mean, I couldn't
buy my own drink,

40
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:13,072
much less
buy this girl a drink.

41
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,174
It was impossible.
But when has that
ever stopped you?

42
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:17,976
Yeah, you're right. I'm
a bold motherfucker, right?

43
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:21,546
I don't have a problem
with this kind of thing.
This is my thing.

44
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,247
But I was...
I was scared, man.

45
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:28,551
Something about this girl
really intimidated me.

46
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:32,755
Something... something
turned me to slush.

47
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:35,791
I didn't know
what I was going
to say to this girl.

48
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,860
Right then,
my guardian angel flew in.

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,330
The bartender.
He's my buddy, Joe.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,531
Okay.

51
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,033
He knows I have flies
in my wallet...

52
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:51,137
But he also sees
that I want to work
some magic on this girl.

53
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:56,608
So he winks at me
and says, "Matt,
what'll it be?"

54
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,276
And I say,
"I'll take a pike,

55
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,578
"and for this pretty girl
sittin' over here,

56
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:02,379
"whatever
pretty girls drink.

57
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,613
Put it on my tab."

58
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:07,482
Ho ho ho!
Bullshit! Bullshit!

59
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,650
( Laughing )
I'm not lying!

60
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,185
I'm telling you the truth.
Why would I lie?

61
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:13,452
Wow.

62
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:16,822
Dude, and her voice,
dude, was so sexy.

63
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,458
She says thank you.
She asked my name.

64
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,494
Before I can ask her
her name, she says
her name's Jessica.

65
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,797
We talked
for about 15 minutes,

66
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,399
and then her friend came
and picked her up.

67
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,335
In the blink of an eye...

68
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,770
She's gone.

69
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,004
Typical.

70
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,238
Yeah.

71
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:40,840
My...

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,374
Heart...

73
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,808
Sank.

74
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,346
My throat was in knots.

75
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,381
( Sighs )

76
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,749
Started heading home.

77
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:57,618
'Bout a mile away...

78
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:01,888
Lo and behold...

79
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,823
What do I see?

80
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:07,059
Jessica and her friend.
No shit.

81
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:10,195
My heart starts going
bup-bup, bup-bup, bup-bup.

82
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:12,697
I start running towards 'em
fast as I can...

83
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:14,532
And right before I get there,

84
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:18,102
this fucking truck comes,
swoops 'em up!

85
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:22,905
Man, I've known this girl
for less than an hour,

86
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:26,475
and I'm already, like,
heartbroken.

87
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,844
I mean,
how pathetic is that?

88
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:31,947
And as I'm standing there
in my little pity party,

89
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:36,017
what do I see? The truck
is heading right back
to here.

90
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:39,186
So what do I do?
I start running right back.

91
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm not even joking.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,421
I burst through the door.

93
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:45,056
I literally almost
run her over.

94
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:51,394
She looks at me. She says,
"I thought you left."

95
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:53,195
And I said, "I went for you."

96
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:56,764
She grabs me, she hugs me.

97
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,233
Mnh.

98
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,868
Damn!

99
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,337
She says,
"I came back for you."

100
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,678
I...

101
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:17,881
I was in love.

102
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,205
Fuck.

103
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,842
What?

104
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:52,278
( Sighs )

105
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:55,080
I hate this story.

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,314
I hate it.

107
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:01,752
It consumes me.

108
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:06,623
I want to be...

109
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:07,924
Rid of it.

110
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:10,593
No, Matt, this is
a good story, man.

111
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:12,127
This is a good story.
This...

112
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,728
You know what?
This is a love story.

113
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:17,064
Oh. That's how
it always begins.

114
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,132
Yeah? And in the end?

115
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,634
T.b.d.

116
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,069
Love is just the beginning.

117
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,238
Cataclysm.

118
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,641
A match.

119
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,776
A spark of flame.

Wow.

138
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:19,489
Hello?

139
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,560
Hello?

140
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,595
Is there anyone here?

141
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,533
Hello, Matt.

142
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,468
Hi.

143
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:37,770
Hey, can you do me
a favor and speak up?

144
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,172
I mean, quiet as fuck.

145
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:42,507
What?

146
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:45,375
Oh.

147
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:48,544
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

148
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:52,781
I won't say "fuck."
I'm sorry. My bad.

149
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:55,517
Tell me about... her.

150
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,719
About her?
Um, well, I guess

151
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:03,223
you could say things
weren't going that great.

152
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,757
I didn't really think
about it much,

153
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:07,226
to tell you the truth.

154
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:10,896
I wasn't suspicious
or anything.

155
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,498
What? I wasn't!
I'm not a jealous guy!

156
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:15,566
I'm not!

157
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,568
Okay, fine.

158
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,002
Fine!

159
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,938
Whatever. Maybe the night
before my birthday...

160
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,940
I was a little miffed.

161
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,441
I'll give you that.

162
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,751
Fuck.

163
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,154
Mother fucking!

164
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:17,755
God damn!

165
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,527
What, can I help you
with something?

166
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:25,729
Yeah.

167
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,998

( Cellphone rings )

169
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,138
Yeah, what?

170
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:39,839
Dave: Whassup, playa?

171
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,008
Happy birthday, son!

172
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:44,943
My birthday's
tomorrow, genius.

173
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,611
And you know what?
Can you please,

174
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,312
please start talking
like a white person?

175
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:52,049
Your "g" voice is really
triggering my gag reflex.

176
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,117
( Over-enunciating )
Okay. All right.

177
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:55,651
Um, what are you up to?

178
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,152
I'm at king's.

179
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:00,255
Oh, yeah?
Just gettin' a cold one?

180
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:02,857
Uh, you know what, man?
Right now's not
a very good time.

181
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:04,358
Why? What's going on?

182
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,060
Jessica's here.
Oh, sorry!

183
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,995
Didn't mean to
interrupt the date.

184
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,597
No, she's laughing it up
with Bruce Willis.

185
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,131
What's she doin'
with Bruce Willis?

186
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,666
No, not really.

187
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,502
Oh, my god, man!

188
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,370
They just keep laughing!

189
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,306
Fuck! I mean,
what's so fuckin' funny?

190
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,408
She's, uh...
She's with another guy?

191
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:26,709
Yep.

192
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,677
Well, I'm sure
there's an explanation.

193
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,345
I'm sure there is.

194
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,046
Well, I doubt
it's that, man.

195
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,547
You guys are
gettin' married.

196
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:37,783
I know. Not to mention,
she's carrying my baby.

197
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,284
Heavenly father.

198
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:41,219
I still can't
imagine you as a dad.

199
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,054
Dude, I'm gonna be
the best dad

200
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,322
in the whole, wide world,
motherfucker.

201
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,290
Oh, let's not get
carried away.

202
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,058
You gonna
talk to Jessica?

203
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:50,492
Yeah.

204
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,840
( No audible dialogue )

205
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:31,596
Babe, hi.

206
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,297
Hi, what's crack-a-lackin'?

207
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,432
Um, this is Tyler swift.

208
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,300
He's the new manager
at the bank.

209
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,502
Matt. Heard
so much about you.

210
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,404
Wow. You must be
really, really new,

211
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,206
'cause I have not
heard about you. At all.

212
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,374
I was just getting
Tyler acquainted

213
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:49,609
with the specifics
of the bank and...

214
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,578
Mmm.

215
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,680
Say your name's
Tyler swift?

216
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,281
Yeah, that's right.

217
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:57,982
Well, that's a good name.

218
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,651
Yeah. Why don't you sit down
and join US for a few?

219
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:04,755
Well.
That's so thoughtful.

220
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:11,227
Nice guy.

221
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,165
Would you care
for a slice?

222
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,056
No.

223
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,858
I'm trying to watch
my figure.

224
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:47,393
You know how it is.

225
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:49,428
Hey, baby, you know what?

226
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,030
We should invite him
to my birthday party.

227
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,898
Wouldn't that be awesome?

228
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:56,867
Yeah, we have
an after-hours staff meeting.

229
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,436
I'm sorry, baby.
I just found out today.

230
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,304
You're not gonna come
to my birthday party?

231
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:03,139
No. I'm sorry, sweetie.

232
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,940
I'll make it up to you.

233
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:11,245
Dang.

234
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,120
What do you mean,
when did it start?

235
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,387
How many times
do I have to tell you,

236
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,788
I'm not a jealous guy.

237
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,657
You son of a bitch!

238
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:36,264
Hey! What are you doing?

239
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:38,766
Stuart and I are going
to see Aladdin tomorrow.

240
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:41,268
Can your friends
do this?

241
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:43,603
Can your friends
do that?

242
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,574
( Shrieks )

243
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:50,942
Bitch!

244
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:51,943
Come on, man.

245
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:52,944
I was, like, 9 years old.

246
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,278
Gimme a break.

247
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:56,513
Stuart? Man,
he was a tool.

248
00:15:56,513 --> 00:16:00,049
They have
an appointment coming up.

249
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,051
They?

250
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,852
Wow.

251
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:07,322
Did jennie really marry
that tool bag Stuart?

252
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:09,757
What is happiness, Matt?

253
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:11,525
What is happiness?

254
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:14,294
I don't know.
I thought we were happy.

255
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:16,396
Now you're making me
think about shit.

256
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,764
What?

257
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,398
Oh, man! Look!

258
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:23,334
I'm gonna say "shit."
I can't help it.

259
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,469
It's like a force of nature.

260
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:31,306
I fell in love with her
for a reason. I mean, right?

261
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:34,909
I mean...

262
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:37,077
We were happy.

263
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:39,379
We were happy for a minute.

264
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,849
( Chuckles )
Probably exactly a minute.

265
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,792
Oh, you!

266
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,393
Such a winner.

267
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,795
And the winner
also brought you dinner.

268
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,564
Tacos!

269
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,799
I love tacos!

273

Get in the boat!
Come on, get into the--

274
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:35,491
I can't-- no. I can't
believe you're wearing that.

275
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,192
You're not even
wearing it right.

276
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:39,661
( Playful growl )

277
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,963
Well, you know I don't
like the water, man.

278
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:44,031
Honey, breathe.

279
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,133
I love you.
I love you, too.

280
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,768
Whoa! No!

281
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,136
Aaahhh!

282
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,937
Oh my god!

283
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,806

Really?
Really.

288
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:09,518
You wanna do this?
I wanna do this.

289
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:11,286
All right, I'm gonna
kick your ass.

290
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:12,720
Ready, set, go.

291
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:17,090
( Chuckling )
Yeah.

292
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,125
Oh my god.
This is good!

293
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,096
Oh, god, did you
get brain freeze?

294
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:28,333
Ha ha ha ha!
You pussy!

295

Hi, please press "send"
when you're ready.

298
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,235
Will you marry me?

299

Yay!

Oh, my god!

301

All good things must
come to an end, right?

302
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,628
I just wish
it wasn't on my fuck--

303
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:42,497
I mean freakin' birthday.

All I wanted to do was
leave that dirty bitch...

She did it to herself.

335

Mind your own business.

336
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:23,490
Where's my cash?

I'm sorry,
is there something
I can do for you?

Sir.
Why?

Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to step
into my office, bud.

344

You broke my heart.

345

Let's take a walk.

346
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,894
Sit down, please.

347
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,670

Look, pal, you're
a fuckin' loser.

So what do you got
to say for yourself?

All I want to know

353

is what the fuck is
going on with my account.

Let's take a look.

355
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:49,924
Well...

356
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,927
Looks like there were
some pretty big purchases

357
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:55,829
made this morning
at the mall.

358
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,297
Special occasion?

359
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,998
I can tell by the look
you're not happy,

360
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,533
so we'll have
to open a fraud claim

361
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,800
to start an investigation

362
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,768
to see what happened,
of course.

363
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,370
That could take a while.

364
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,772
But after further review,

365
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:11,240
mutt,

366
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,409
your account barely had
a dollar in it anyways.

367
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,577
So here's
what we're gonna do:

368
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:19,246
You've still got my wallet
and jacket. Keep 'em.

369
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,747
Hell, pawn 'em.

370
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:22,915
I guarantee you,
they're worth more

371
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:25,417
than your account balance
was anyways.

372
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:32,256
( Groans )

373
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,373
( Groans )

374
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:07,422
Look, fuck.

375
00:26:08,823 --> 00:26:12,193
I'll see you
on the other side
of the field.

376
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:14,528
Have a nice day.

377
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:18,331
( Mirthless laughter )

378
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:19,565
See ya.

379
00:26:27,272 --> 00:26:30,308
What? What advice?
You mean that guy bill?

380
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:31,876
That guy was a loon.

381
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:33,877
( Bill groaning )

382
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,114
( Small object clatters )

383
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:46,188
( Gargles )

384
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,090
Yi-yi-yi.

385
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,624
Hey!

386
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:53,193
Gabor!

387
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:55,728
I don't have anything
for you yet.

388
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:57,229
But I'm doin'
the best I can.

389
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:02,067
Y-You gotta remember
that this business
is forever slow.

390
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:10,341
And that's it.
Slow?
Yeah.

391
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,109
( Eastern European accent )
Oh, slow.

392
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:15,045
You know what
I'm gonna do?
What?

393
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:17,380
I'm going to fuck you
real slow

394
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,850
if we don't get
our money, Billy boy!

395
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,017
You gonna fuck me
real slow?

396
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,351
Why the fuck
you wanna do that?

397
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,885
Why don't you do
something professional,

398
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:27,420
like snapping my fingers
or breaking my knee?

399
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,988
Shut up.

400
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:31,557
Enough of your shit.
Okay?

401
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:32,891
'Nuff of my shit?

402
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:34,926
You get me?
Yeah, I get ya.

403
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:36,460
( Passionate shriek )
I got news for ya.

404
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,563
You don't even know
my sexual orientation!

405
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:42,499
What if all I wanted
to do in the world is
get fucked real slow?

406
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:45,401
Are you gonna reward me
for not paying you?

407
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:48,437
Shut the fucking fuck up,
Billy, fuck!

408
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:54,675
I want the money...

409
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,343
By next Tuesday...

410
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,378
Or I'm going
come back in here

411
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:01,681
and shovel all this
junk in your ass.

412
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,016
Now, why would you want
to shove all this junk
in my ass?

413
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,885
My ass isn't that big.

414
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,120
Do you fuckin' get me?

415
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,055
Yeah, I can see
right through you, buddy.

416
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,423
You're transparent
like a dead scorpion.

417
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,825
I can turn this thing
into a combat zone

418
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,927
just like that.

419
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:18,728
And you won't have a chance.

420
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:22,032
You tell your father
I'm gonna pay him
back in full,

421
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:25,235
I just don't want to be
taken out by your mob.

422
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:27,103
We ain't no "mob."

423
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:30,806
We are eastern European
organization.

424
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:34,141
( Laughing )
That was a good answer.

425
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:40,212
Are you gonna leave
or something, or...?

426
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:43,715
I... been looking
for an antique lampshade.

427
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:48,019
Something, uh, colorful
but still elegant.

428
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,087
Okay, well, back in
the corner there,

429
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:53,223
I've got some...
Tons of lampshades.

430
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:55,458
Why don't you go
pick one out?

431
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,660
Perfect.
Thanks, bill.

432
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:08,636
Hi.
( Chuckles )

433
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:11,171
You surprised me.
I should keep my eyes

434
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:12,505
on the perimeter better.

435
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:15,374
Welcome to my pawn shop.
Good to see you here.

436
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:17,509
There's lots of
interesting things to buy.

437
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:22,079
Cool. Your name's
bill, huh? I'm Matt.

438
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,081
Yeah.

439
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:26,349
How did you know my name?

440
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,085
Uh, nothing.
Well, look, I was hoping

441
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:30,453
to sell this wallet
to you.

442
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:32,888
Oh, shit.
Shit what?

443
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,522
Let me tell you, kid,

444
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,690
owning a pawn shop
sucks balls.

445
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,091
I've been open
for three months.

446
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:39,625
I haven't sold anything.

447
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:42,527
Oh, man, I could see
how that would suck.

448
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:43,861
Wait!

449
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:46,129
What?

450
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:49,098
Oh! Thank you!

451
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:53,101
I am going to focus
more on selling

452
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:54,902
than I am buying.

453
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:56,103
You know, part of
the problem might be

454
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:58,038
that you're selling
all this junk.

455
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:59,873
You should buy this
beautiful billfold wallet.

456
00:29:59,873 --> 00:30:02,775
Leather.

457
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,676
Two bill compartments.

458
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:07,111
Six card slots.

459
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:08,545
Voila!

460
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:12,281
Does it have a 4-leaf
clover on it?

461
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,416
Um, no. No, it doesn't.

462
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,651
Does it have
bugs bunny on it?

463
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,653
No, no bugs bunny.

464
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,721
A yin-Yang sign?

465
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:22,189
Could paste one on, maybe.

466
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:23,523
Nah, I can't take it.

467
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:26,058
This is all I got, man.
Come on.

468
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,760
Wait. Is that a Bentley-
ettiger billfold wallet?

469
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,129
Yeah!

470
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,730
I can't use it.

471
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,566
Well, you know what?

472
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:36,700
This is all I have.

473
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,368
Looks like you're
having fun with this,

474
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:41,304
so, uh, thanks
for nothin', dick.

475
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:43,572
Hey, wait,
I'll buy the wallet.
You will?

476
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:46,441
Yeah, I'll give you
twenty dollars for it.

477
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,276
Twenty bucks?
Yeah.

478
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:49,510
Oh, come on, man.

479
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,678
This wallet is worth
way more than that.

480
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:54,614
I mean, look,
a rich douchebag manager

481
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:58,884
had to pay well over
a hundred dollars for
a wallet like this.

482
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:00,151
That wallet's stolen!

483
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,386
I could tell by the way
you walked in here,

484
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:04,388
you're desperate
and confused.

485
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:07,157
You're nothin'
but a fuckin'
stink man.

486
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,992
Look, I'm gonna
level with you:

487
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,995
I've been through
a lot lately, okay?

488
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,098
This guy,
he took my girl.

489
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:19,001
He took my money.
I don't even have
enough gas to get home.

490
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,502
All I have...

491
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:23,271
Is this wallet.

492
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,140
Please help me.

493
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,808
You're a fuckin' crack head.

494
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:30,477
I've heard
these stories before.

495
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:32,145
What you're gonna do,
you're gonna take

496
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,479
the money I give you
for that wallet,

497
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,813
you're gonna go out
and get high

498
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:36,481
with your buddies
behind the dumpster,

499
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,449
come back in here
and Rob the store.

500
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,984
A crack head virus,
robbing pawnshop
after pawnshop.

501
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,785
That's what you're gonna do.

502
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:46,488
All right, look.

503
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:51,626
Believe it or not,
this guy actually
gave me this wallet.

504
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:54,762
Okay? How do I prove
to you I'm not a crack head?

505
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,697
I'll tell you how
you can prove it.

506
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:59,633
I won't take the wallet,
but I'll take your coat,

507
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:03,470
and a crack head doesn't
want to part with something
that keeps him warm.

508
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,707
Sixty dollars, and that
should fill your tank.

509
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:16,380
Here you go.
Let me be fatherly to you.

510
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,149
I want you to use that
to better your life.

511
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,418
And get out of the past,
quit carrying that
baggage with you

512
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:25,154
because your future
begins right now.

513
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:27,089
And this
isn't your last chapter.

514
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:29,091
And remember
these four words:

515
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:31,793
It could be worse.

516
00:32:31,793 --> 00:32:33,294
So you're not done.

517
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:35,863
You're just
beginning again.

518
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:41,234
I got this thing
I repeat in my head.

519
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:43,069
It just repeats
over and over again.

520
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:48,874
It's-- it's not music,
it's... sweet revenge.

521
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:52,610
You gotta be nice.

522
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,779
Ha ha!
Yeah, nice don't
cut it no more.

523
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:12,962
Wow! You meet
all kinds of people here.

524
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:14,830
I mean, seriously,
how was I supposed to have

525
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,699
the foresight to know
that some old pawnshop keeper

526
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:21,002
would have prophesied
things to come?

527
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,670
I mean, you tell me.

528
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,340
How's a mere mortal supposed
to see that one coming?

529
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,743
Yeah, you think you know
everything, don't you?

530
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:32,612
Trust me, that was just
the beginning of the spiral.

531
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:35,381
Things got a whole lot
weirder after that.

532
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:38,617
( Engine won't start )

533
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,851
Fuck!

534
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:45,889
You have bad luck.

535
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,390
What?

536
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,662
What do you want, man?

537
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:56,397
You have bad luck.

538
00:33:56,397 --> 00:33:59,133
I on the other hand
have amazing luck.

539
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,701
I'm so lucky.

540
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:02,669
Okay, well, you know what?
Mine's infectious,

541
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:04,704
so, uh, maybe you should
do yourself a favor

542
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:06,238
and fuck off.

543
00:34:06,238 --> 00:34:09,107
Oh, but I have so much,
I want to share it!

544
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:12,977
Look, I don't really
have time for a luck-off
right now,

545
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:14,478
and you're weird.

546
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:18,314
You're kind of
freakin' me out.

547
00:34:18,314 --> 00:34:19,882
What do you want?

548
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,884
Why you in such big hurry?

549
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,719
You have big hot date?

550
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,920
What?

551
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,755
Yeah. Big hot date.

552
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:29,424
You've never heard
this phrase before?

553
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:31,993
No, I don't have a date. Why?

554
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,961
Oh.

555
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:38,131
You are the guy who
plays on wrong side
of ball team.

556
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:39,999
I don't get it.
You know...

557
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:42,234
Bat from behind the plate.

558
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:44,769
It's been fun, man.

559
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,504
You take care.

560
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:49,874
Your story in there,
I heard it.

561
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:52,243
It hurt my heart.

562
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:56,013
Look... I want to help.

563
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:00,116
My heart, uh,
it hurts, too.

564
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,118
You got cheated on, too?

565
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:03,819
Ni! Cheated.

566
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,787
But I... I feel bad.

567
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,157
You know, I...
Go out, I party
too hard one night,

568
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:12,093
make love to this
beautiful woman,

569
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:16,730
then I put it in too long,
and... now I have baby.

570
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,832
Well...

571
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:23,235
Ah, well, fuck it.
I guess it's been
one of those days.

572
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:25,303
Hey. Step into my office.

573
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,538
Hey! You're gonna
make my day.

574
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:29,172
( Clears throat )

575
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,975
In return,
I give you money.

576
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,810
What?
Very exciting!

577
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,044
What, like a job?

578
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:37,712
Yes! Yes, yes.

579
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:39,880
Very small job,
very soon.

580
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,948
That's very charitable
of you, man.

581
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:44,884
Chair-table? What is
this? I have no need
for a chair-table.

582
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:46,385
No, no, no, no.

583
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:48,253
"Charitable."
you know, like, one word.

584
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:50,388
It means "giving,"
you know.

585
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:51,889
It's a joke!

586
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:54,458
Come on, man!
I'm funny like you.

587
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,826
Not fucking retard.

588
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:59,095
Okay. I get it,
I guess, man.

589
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:01,197
What do you want, man?
Okay.

590
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:04,366
Shit! Fuck, man!

591
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:07,535
( Laughing )
Hold gun!

592
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:10,237
Hold gun.
I want to see.

593
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,671
Okay.

594
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,206
All right, big boy,
put it in your pocket

595
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,840
and pull out fast,
like cowboy.

596
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,911
Is this like a test?
All right. Fast, huh?

597
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,913
Oh! Wow, man!

598
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,881
Very fast! Very exciting!

599
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,517
Okay, give me gun.

600
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:32,188
You look strong.

601
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:33,689
You punch hard?

602
00:36:33,689 --> 00:36:35,691
Only way I know how,
motherfucker.

603
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:38,293
All right.
Punch my hand.

604
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:39,794
I am big boy, too.

605
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:42,196
I want to feel
how strong you are.

606
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:43,530
What? Why?

607
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,098
No time
for second-guessing.

608
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:46,999
You must do what I tell you,
when I tell you!

609
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,535
Ohh! Oh, wow, man,
that's very painful.

610
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:52,603
Oh my god,
are you okay?

611
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:55,138
Ah. This is going
to bruise so much.

612
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:56,772
Oh, no.

613
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:00,541
Okay! I take you!

614
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,609
What is your name?

615
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:04,210
Matt.
Hey, Matt, I'm gab--

616
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,778
aah! Gabor.

617
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:09,181
Gabor, I'm so sorry.
This is fine.

618
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:10,715
Well, where do you want--
where do you want to go?

619
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:13,484
I take you for ice cream.
We talk more. Go.

620
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:14,818
What? Now we're
discriminating?

621
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,554
Oh, come on.
Seemed like a nice guy.

622
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:20,023
Mobsters are cool, too.

623
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:22,458
How the hell was I supposed to
know what was going to happen?

624
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,861
I'll tell you,
I'll never look at
bunnies the same way again.

625
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:28,530
Gabor: I said no clowns!
( Clown horn toots )

626
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,565
You make the kids cry!

627
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:32,700
You think this is funny?
( Clown horn toots )

628
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,303
What?
Very not professional!

629
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:39,072
We will not forget this!

630
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,109
Sorry. I had business
to take care of.

631
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:48,846
Okay, Matt. Are you ready?

632
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:50,147
( Chuckles )

633
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:52,849
You must not be scary
like clown.

634
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:55,117
Yeah, I think I got that.

635
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:59,654
Matt, my father
is very powerful.

636
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,822
Do not disappoint.

637
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:04,557
Okay.

638
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:07,025
Well, what do you
want me to do?

639
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:11,596
Put on rabbit suit.

640
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,133
What, a birthday party?

641
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,634
Yes. Put on suit.

642
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:21,069
Hop, hop, hop,
make kids happy.

643
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:23,104
I have to make balloon
animals and shit?

644
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:24,472
Can you?

645
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:25,673
No, not really.

646
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,642
Fine. But you must
learn for other times,

647
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,176
which there will be
many of.

648
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:31,877
Are you sure you don't
want me to, like,

649
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,912
I don't know,
deliver something,

650
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,880
guard a door,
drive a getaway car?

651
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,582
I mean, this is lame,
man...!

652
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,584
How can I trust you

653
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,453
if you can't
even make kids laugh?

654
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,455
This is easy.

655
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:48,791
Hop hop,
and I give you money.

656
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:54,896
I gotta take a piss.

657
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:57,665
Good.

658
00:38:57,665 --> 00:38:59,799
And take the suit.

659
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:02,901
Okay.

660
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:10,407
Okay.

661
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:28,991
( Sudden chuckle )

662
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,828
Finally the day
is getting a little better.

663
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:36,497
Gonna get a lot better.

664
00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:40,601
Aw, shit...!

665
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:43,203
Huh! Oh, shit!

666
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,143
Okay, guys, come on.
Come to daddy.

667
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,718
Oh, crap.

668
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:05,322
Whew.

669
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:12,828
Tyleyou're
a fucking loser.

670
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,501
( Gasps )

671
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,370
( Distorted voices )

672
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,307
Was that Vicodin?

673
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:27,775
( Passionate scream )

674
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:31,044
Just... chill out.

675
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:34,880
All right.

676
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,448
I'll be right out!

677
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:48,925
Ohh!
Oh, boy.

678
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,828
Okay. Party time.

679
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,796
I just need to rest.

680
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,978
I'm coming!

681
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,454
( Laughing )

682
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:29,626
I can do this. All right.

683
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:33,596
Kids' party.

684
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:35,598
Okay. Okay, man.

685
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:37,533
Pull yourself together.

686
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:38,967
Shit.

687
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:55,382
Where is he?
I don't see him!

688
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,916
Hi!

689
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,784
( All screaming
and shouting )

690
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,652
Shit!

691
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,421
Aaahhh!

692
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,256
Aah!

693
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,024
Aah! Aah!

694
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,434
Oh, shit!

695
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:31,879
Everyone is
asking for you.

696
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:37,250
Think you'll make it
down to the party?

697
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,951
Eh.

698
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:41,853
I got rid of scary clown.

699
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,722
( Chuckling )

700
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:46,023
I got candy!

701
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:49,059
This new guy is good.

702
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,261
The kids love
to play with the rabbit.

703
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:52,862
Hey!

704
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:56,298
And your grandchildren...

705
00:42:56,298 --> 00:42:57,666
Help!

706
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,501
...are laughing!

707
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:00,802
Yes!

708
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:04,172
( Matt shouting )

709
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:32,131
Oh, no.

710
00:43:58,056 --> 00:43:59,891
Uh, Gabor... hey.

711
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:02,659
Matt.

712
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:04,460
My father...
He likes you.

713
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,196
Oh.
You will work
many parties.

714
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:09,364
Why, uh...
You know what?

715
00:44:09,364 --> 00:44:11,566
Birthday parties
aren't really my thing.

716
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,900
Listen to me.

717
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,534
That was amazing.

718
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:17,069
I don't know where
you get this energy from,

719
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:20,639
but... this is your destiny.

720
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:22,073
Well, I hope not.

721
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:23,641
Matt.

722
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,509
I am not lying.

723
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:27,344
This is most very lucky.

724
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:30,313
Children love you.

725
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:32,948
You will be great
father one day.

726
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:34,916
Hey, um...

727
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:37,118
Hey, do you have
a doctor here,
by any chance?

728
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:38,919
Why, you don't get hard?

729
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:40,720
What?

730
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,688
Your dick.
It is always soft?

731
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:44,523
What the hell?

732
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:45,857
No.

733
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:47,358
No. You know what?

734
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,827
I think you left some
pills in the bathroom,

735
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:52,896
the kids
might have gotten into.

736
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:55,231
Oh.

737
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:56,732
Oh, shit.

738
00:44:56,732 --> 00:44:57,966
Okay, I call doc.

739
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,867
But now, we party.

740
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,536
We drink and forget
about the girl.

741
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:03,870
Okay.

742
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,073
I never turn down
a free drink.

743
00:45:07,073 --> 00:45:09,275
Let's go to my club.

744
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:14,146
You know what?
What was that stuff,
anyway, do you know?

745
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:18,116
I mean, the bottle
said Vicodin,

746
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:21,619
but, uh, yeah.
It's just... no way.

747
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,755
You know what, too?

748
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:30,059
Thinking back,
I really should have
peaced outta there

749
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:34,062
with that 300 bucks,
but I was just--

750
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:35,863
I was really compelled.

751
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:39,700
I was compelled.
I just wanted to see
where the day would take me.

752
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,802
And by god, did it
fuckin' take me somewhere.

753
00:45:45,738 --> 00:45:48,573
Welcome to Jurassic park.

754
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:52,910
Ohh! Man!

755
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,578
Just kidding.

756
00:45:54,578 --> 00:45:57,080
Always wanted
to say that shit.

757
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,082
Good fucking movie.

758
00:45:59,082 --> 00:46:02,418
Dinosaurs. Scary shit.

759
00:46:02,418 --> 00:46:04,119
It was all right.
I don't know.

760
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,922
I was always more of
an e.Man, personally.

761
00:46:07,922 --> 00:46:09,924
What are you,
fucking pussy?!

762
00:46:09,924 --> 00:46:11,492
Hey.

763
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:14,661
Let's go get
drink and discuss
how pussy you are.

764
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,195
For the record,

765
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:19,498
Jurassic paryes,
it's a much better movie.

766
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:22,167
Okay? I mean, it's got
Jeff goldblum. Cool.

767
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:24,035
Dinosaurs. Rad!

768
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:26,003
But e.T.'S a tender movie.

769
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:28,939
I was feeling tender.

770
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:31,274
Looking beautiful,
baby.

771
00:46:31,274 --> 00:46:34,210
Hi, darlin'.
Hi.

772
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,079
What will it be, boys?

773
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,647
Li'l I.P.A.?

774
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,482
Lemon drop.

775
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:42,716
Sure.

776
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:46,452
So, you got
a girl at home, Gabor?

777
00:46:46,452 --> 00:46:50,722
Mnh. Not right now.
Fucking bitches are crazy.

778
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:53,691
They're all crazy.
Must be the weather here.

779
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,492
Yeah, tell me about it.

780
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:58,595
Yeah. So what happened
with your bitch?

781
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:01,564
She fucked Tyler swift.

782
00:47:03,265 --> 00:47:05,600
She fucked Taylor swift?

783
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,137
Holy shit!
That is sexy, man!

784
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:13,073
( Laughing )
Why you so pissed?

785
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:15,975
No, no, no.
Tyler swift.

786
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:20,512
As in attractive
asshole bank manager,

787
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:24,015
not attractive
goddess singer.

788
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,549
You know what I'm saying?

789
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:28,118
Shit, is that
a shitty name to have.

790
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:31,554
Yeah, well.
Not like she cared.

791
00:47:31,554 --> 00:47:33,222
So what happened?
She told you?

792
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:34,923
No, I caught her.

793
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:36,190
His dick was still in her

794
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,359
when I started kicking
his fucking ass.

795
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,060
( Sighs )
That fucked, man.

796
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,162
Stupid bitches.

797
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:45,330
I wish I could watch her
burn alive, man.

798
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,632
I wish... I wish
I could turn on the news

799
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:51,602
and see a fuckin' story
about a terrible
fuckin' accident

800
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,170
involving her.

801
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,340
You are angry
motherfucker, man.

802
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,910
Baby pie, can you
turn on the news for me?

803
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,311
Sure thing, hot lips.

804
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:11,417
I love it when
she calls me that.

805
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:13,552
I don't think
that's a chick.

806
00:48:13,552 --> 00:48:17,188
What? What do you mean?
Of course it's a chick.

807
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:18,956
The woman,

808
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,490
believed to be
in her mid-20s

809
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,892
with brunette hair
has just been identified.

810
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:25,895
She and another motorist
were killed tragically
in a high-speed collision...

811
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:28,597
No fucking way.

812
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:30,098
Holy shit.

813
00:48:30,098 --> 00:48:31,966
We've just confirmed
with police that the identity

814
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:35,302
of the female victim is
local waitress Kate strange.

815
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:37,037
Her family could not
be reached for comment.

816
00:48:37,037 --> 00:48:40,206
( Snaps fingers )
So close.

817
00:48:40,206 --> 00:48:42,875
( Chuckles )
Thanks, honey.

818
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,043
Ah, well.

819
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:47,178
She sounded like
a bitch anyway.

820
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:51,047
You know what you need,
my friend?
What's that?

821
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:54,116
You need love companion.

822
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:56,051
Love companion?
Mm-hmm.

823
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:57,285
Hm.

824
00:48:57,285 --> 00:48:59,153
Why, you got, like,

825
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:02,022
pussy flying around
this place or what?

826
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:06,192
Yes. I. Do.

827
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:07,760
Please don't judge me.

828
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,862
I not judge.

829
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:12,898
Holy Moses!

830
00:49:12,898 --> 00:49:15,533
Who? No, Matt,
that's Mabel.

831
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:18,569
Moses is, like,
from Bible or some shit.

832
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:19,870
Hm.

833
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:24,974
Welcome to Gabor's
international house
of pussy.

834
00:49:24,974 --> 00:49:27,776
( Chuckles )

835
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:30,311
It's on the house
tonight, honey bunny.

836
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:32,445
Do with him as you wish.

837
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,981
Mmm!

838
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:41,486
Who is this big
hunk of steaming love, hmm?

839
00:49:41,486 --> 00:49:44,622
Whoa. You sound... strong.

840
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:47,324
I'm stronger
than any man can handle.

841
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:51,661
( Phonograph needle
scratches record )

842
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:54,697
What's your name, cowboy?

843
00:49:56,365 --> 00:49:58,367
I'm Matt. I was
actually gonna go.

844
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:00,068
Oh, no you're not.

845
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:02,770
Yeah, I am.
I'm tired.

846
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,439
( Laughing )

847
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,107
Mmm.

848
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,942
So, uh...

849
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:11,077
Yeah, you're Mabel,
right?

850
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:14,113
Mm-hmm.
So what do you like?

851
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:15,981
Uh, I guess I like that.

852
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:18,083
Ahh.

853
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,317
What?

854
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:22,286
Are you a naughty boy?

855
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,954
No, I'm not a naughty boy.

856
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,289
Oh, I think you are!

857
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:31,159
No....
I think you were
naughty today!

858
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,660
( Laughing )

859
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,297
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can we just talk, please?

860
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:39,966
Yeah, okay. Okay.

861
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:41,567
What's wrong?

862
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:44,369
I don't know,
I'm nervous.

863
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:47,939
I haven't been
around such a mature,
beautiful woman like you.

864
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:49,340
Ohh.

865
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,976
You don't have to be
shy around me, you know.

866
00:50:52,976 --> 00:50:55,144
Mother Mabel
is here to help you,

867
00:50:55,144 --> 00:50:58,480
so just... spit it out.

868
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,815
Well.
Yeah.

869
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:02,516
Okay.

870
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:03,950
Well...

871
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,585
Uh...

872
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:13,624
Whew.

873
00:51:13,624 --> 00:51:15,993
Well, that's
quite the story.

874
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,561
Yeah.

875
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:19,229
You're telling me.
Now I'm the father

876
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:23,132
of this baby
that's being carried
inside of this whore,

877
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:24,733
and...

878
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,204
I'm sorry, but...

879
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:32,339
I can't think
of anything else,

880
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,676
just frickin'
wringing her throat.

881
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,311
Have you really
thought about this?

882
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:40,879
Of course I have.
I mean...

883
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:45,182
No, I mean about why
this happened.

884
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:46,750
What?

885
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,618
I think what
you've got to do

886
00:51:48,618 --> 00:51:53,022
is you have
to focus on what
really matters here.

887
00:51:53,022 --> 00:51:56,091
I don't know if
I articulated this clearly--

888
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:58,426
hey. Look.

889
00:51:58,426 --> 00:52:01,529
I've been there.
I've made my mistakes.

890
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:05,533
God knows
I have paid for them.

891
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:10,370
But if you don't
figure out why she did

892
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,473
what she did,
you're in big trouble.

893
00:52:13,473 --> 00:52:16,676
No. I'm sorry.

894
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,844
Unh-unh.
There's no excuse--

895
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,380
no excuse for
what she's done whatsoever.

896
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:28,018
If you don't understand,
then you can't let it go.

897
00:52:28,018 --> 00:52:32,488
You can't move on, so you've
got to understand why.

898
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,556
Why does a woman
fall for a man?

899
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:36,558
She falls for
the whole package.

900
00:52:36,558 --> 00:52:39,994
She chooses how much
money he earns,

901
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:42,062
what his job is.

902
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:43,296
That's what it is.

903
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:46,399
I know. I know.

904
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:49,402
I've been where you are.

905
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:52,738
I-I-I blamed the whole world
for all my problems.

906
00:52:52,738 --> 00:52:56,941
Boo hoo! Sob, sob, sob.
Poor me, poor me!

907
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:59,209
It was not easy just...

908
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,946
Climbing myself back up

909
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,148
to some good place.

910
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,418
So... you're
in a good place?

911
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:12,021
Couldn't be happier.

912
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:15,390
Really?

913
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:18,493
Of course I'm not happy!
Life is shit!

914
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:23,831
I'm 65 years old,
and I sleep with drunken
fools for a living.

915
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:27,067
And Gabor only keeps me
here because I look
enough like a man

916
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:30,537
so he can get his rocks off
from time to time.

917
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:34,540
Aha! I knew there was
something with that guy, man.

918
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,208
I knew it.

919
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,642
Look.

920
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,846
You have to walk away
while you still can,

921
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,414
while you can get out of it.

922
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:46,849
She's gonna regret
that decision.

923
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,718
You know, you can be
sure of that.

924
00:53:49,718 --> 00:53:52,854
But if you don't get up
and get out of here,

925
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:57,591
you're gonna end up
a 65-year-old barmaid

926
00:53:57,591 --> 00:54:01,427
begging for crack
and making tips.

927
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:03,462
You beg for crack?

928
00:54:03,462 --> 00:54:05,864
Sometimes.

929
00:54:05,864 --> 00:54:07,732
Wow.
Trust me, honey.

930
00:54:07,732 --> 00:54:10,067
Just take those
sexy legs of yours

931
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:13,203
and just march on
out of here.

932
00:54:13,203 --> 00:54:15,605
Why don't you?

933
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:18,741
Where am I gonna go?

934
00:54:18,741 --> 00:54:20,409
Well, I don't know.

935
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:23,779
Anywhere could be
better than here, right?

936
00:54:23,779 --> 00:54:26,581
Look at you, turning
the tables on me!

937
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:28,816
Ha ha ha!

938
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:35,388
I'm kind of institutionalized
within the family.

939
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:38,924
I used to work
for Gabor's dad.

940
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:42,360
You don't just
walk away from that.

941
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,930
Oh, that's not true.

942
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,365
Everyone gets
a second chance, right?

943
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:50,600
If you want it bad enough.

944
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,436
Even Jessica?

945
00:54:53,436 --> 00:54:56,038
Even you?

946
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:00,909
I'll tell you what.
What?

947
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:04,011
I'll make you a deal.
Okay.

948
00:55:05,445 --> 00:55:08,080
If you get out of here...

949
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,815
If you woon
getting out of here,

950
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:15,552
I'll work on forgiving her.

951
00:55:15,552 --> 00:55:17,453
Ooh! ( Laughing )

952
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:21,122
You're quite
the negotiator here.

953
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:22,389
Well...

954
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,624
All right.

955
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:27,626
Thank you for
your insight, miss Mabel.

956
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:30,595
Ah. Mother Mabel.

957
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:31,696
Mother Mabel.

958
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:33,497
Well, thank you.

959
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,931
( Chuckles )

960
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,899
Uh, wa-- um.

961
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:40,669
Before you go,
on your way out,
could you just--

962
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:44,906
could you...
Tell... Gabor...

963
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:49,176
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You were the ride
of my life.

964
00:55:49,176 --> 00:55:51,144
Right. Thank you.

965
00:55:58,618 --> 00:55:59,685
Good luck!

966
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:01,119
Thank you.

967
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:12,328
Yeah, you know what?

968
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:16,197
That really was
good advice.

969
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,132
It really was.

970
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,435
Yep.

971
00:56:21,435 --> 00:56:22,936
Too bad.

972
00:56:22,936 --> 00:56:26,205
Had to go out and drink
four pink panty droppers.

973
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:28,207
I forgot every word.

974
00:56:28,207 --> 00:56:31,510
( Laughing )

975
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,044
Ohh.

976
00:56:33,978 --> 00:56:35,212
Ahh!

977
00:56:46,322 --> 00:56:49,124
Fuck!

978
00:56:54,228 --> 00:56:55,462
Fuck!

979
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:56,896
Hey!

980
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,474
Hey!

981
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:16,846
Voices: Matt! Matt!
Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt!

982
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:18,314
Let's do it!
To Vegas again!

983
00:57:18,314 --> 00:57:20,349
Let's do this again.
Memories, let's do it.

984
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,184
Matt.

985
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:24,319
What the shit?

986
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,087
Chill out, man.

987
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:27,254
Here.

988
00:57:27,254 --> 00:57:30,190
Drink vodka.

989
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,424
Thank you.

990
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:35,360
By the way...

991
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,463
That's the douchebag,
over there.

992
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:40,064
Who?

993
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:41,632
Ahh.

994
00:57:41,632 --> 00:57:43,500
That fuck,

995
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,035
he's the one that
ploughed my girlfriend.

996
00:57:48,404 --> 00:57:51,473
The fuck is in my club?

997
00:57:51,473 --> 00:57:55,043
The fuck is in your club.

998
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:07,587
Next time we go to Vegas,
you guys need to...

999
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:08,988
Excuse me.

1000
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:13,691
( Swift continues chattering )

1001
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:15,192
Hey!

1002
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,529
Something I can
help you with, friend?

1003
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,964
Your name is...?

1004
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:24,432
Tyler.

1005
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,335
Tyler swift.

1006
00:58:28,335 --> 00:58:32,338
Your name is Tyler swift?

1007
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:34,139
So?

1008
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,406
What?

1009
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:38,008
Do you fuck mothers?

1010
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:39,609
( Chuckling )
Excuse me?

1011
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:42,612
Do. You.

1012
00:58:42,612 --> 00:58:45,181
Fuck. Mothers?

1013
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:50,919
My boy Matt here
is expecting a baby

1014
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:53,788
from that
mother you fucked.

1015
00:58:53,788 --> 00:58:56,423
No.
No, he isn't.

1016
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:01,961
What the fuck
did you say, bitch boy?

1017
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:04,263
I said, she sold
that cheap-ass

1018
00:59:04,263 --> 00:59:07,399
fuckin' engagement ring
and aborted the bastard.

1019
00:59:07,399 --> 00:59:09,601
You fuckin' ass!

1020
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:12,837
That was fucking
mistake, buddy.

1021
00:59:12,837 --> 00:59:16,106
She needed help,
so I helped.

1022
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:19,375
Eh... more like encouraged.

1023
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,743
Hell.

1024
00:59:20,743 --> 00:59:23,245
I just told her to do it.

1025
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,652
What you lookin' at, ugly?

1026
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,520
( Sniffing )

1027
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,655
Smell like...

1028
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,690
Smell like pussy!

1029
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,025
Fuck no! Motherfucker!

1030
00:59:42,827 --> 00:59:44,562
Take him out!

1031
00:59:44,562 --> 00:59:48,999
Looks like you all fucked
with the wrong guy
in the wrong club.

1032
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:54,771
( Indistinct grunts )
Shut the fuck up.

1033
00:59:54,771 --> 00:59:57,106
( Tyler grunts )

1034
00:59:57,106 --> 01:00:00,142
He's all yours, Matt.

1035
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:05,513
Aah!
Look at me!

1036
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:07,882
You think she could ever
love a loser like you?

1037
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:09,617
You were
a seat-filler, pal!

1038
01:00:09,617 --> 01:00:13,587
What'd you fuckin'
say to me?
You heard me.

1039
01:00:13,587 --> 01:00:15,055
This motherfucker!

1040
01:00:15,055 --> 01:00:18,658
( Tyler grunting )

1041
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,192
...the fuck down there.

1042
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:23,395
I'm gonna rip your
fuckin' head off.

1043
01:00:23,395 --> 01:00:24,662
You hear me?

1044
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,364
Gabor: Okay.
Okay, buddy.

1045
01:00:27,364 --> 01:00:28,832
Cool off, cool off,
cool off.

1046
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:30,866
Go cool off.

1047
01:00:32,634 --> 01:00:34,669
Ahhh!

1048
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:36,337
Fuck!

1049
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:47,179
Now.

1050
01:00:48,547 --> 01:00:51,049
Listen to me, swift.

1051
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,917
Hey!

1052
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,885
Hey, buddy.

1053
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,087
You're an asshole.
I get it.

1054
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:02,057
But there's some shit
you just don't joke about.

1055
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:04,726
So I'm gonna ask you
one time...

1056
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:07,362
And don't
fucking lie to me...

1057
01:01:09,864 --> 01:01:12,666
His girl really
get an abortion?

1058
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:17,236
You fucking punk.

1059
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:18,971
Hear me.

1060
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:21,673
When your fucking wife
is pregnant,

1061
01:01:21,673 --> 01:01:23,341
I'm going to find you,

1062
01:01:23,341 --> 01:01:25,843
I'm going to fuck her,

1063
01:01:25,843 --> 01:01:27,544
then...

1064
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:34,550
Then I'm going to cut out
the little bastard

1065
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,152
and fuck him, too!

1066
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:41,089
You're going to fuck
my unborn son?

1067
01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:43,124
What the fuck?
Ywant to die?

1068
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:44,358
Get out of here!

1069
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:47,627
Get out of here!
Piece of shit!

1070
01:01:50,496 --> 01:01:54,332
Is it hard to understand
me or something?

1071
01:01:56,867 --> 01:01:58,735
Oh, shit, man!

1072
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:00,236
Buttfucking! Buttfucking!

1073
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:04,206
That's all they hear,
is "buttfucking"!

1074
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:07,209
What kind of world
do we live in?

1075
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:09,744
It's not about
fucking the butts.

1076
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:14,381
It's about fucking
killing people!

1077
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,965
She killed my... kid.

1078
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:35,867
With your engagement ring.
Don't forget that part.

1079
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:39,036
That sort of makes it
really juicy, you know?

1080
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:42,039
( Sighs )

1081
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,940
What do you want to do?

1082
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,942
You want to kill her?

1083
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:48,744
We could like, uh,
crucify her.

1084
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:51,112
You know, like Jesus.

1085
01:02:52,913 --> 01:02:55,916
I need to talk to Dave.

1086
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:58,084
Hey, I know.
What about, uh, Dave?

1087
01:02:58,084 --> 01:03:00,753
I mean, he's one of your bros.
He'll vouch for me, right?

1088
01:03:00,753 --> 01:03:02,788
Is vouching for you.

1089
01:03:02,788 --> 01:03:04,956
Oh.

1090
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:08,092
Oh, I get it.

1091
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:09,593
You guys are just
pickin' on me

1092
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:12,729
'cause I'm the one
that took the bullet.

1093
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:14,931
Did you guys talk to
that prick Tyler yet?

1094
01:03:14,931 --> 01:03:16,799
Tyler
had his appointment.

1095
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,201
He's gone.

1096
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:22,237
Where did he go?

1097
01:03:24,105 --> 01:03:27,341
( Chortling )

1098
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:28,575
Sucker.

1099

1126
01:04:46,536 --> 01:04:48,170
There. Now.

1127
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,838
Poop in peace.

1128
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:51,372

What up, playa?

1130
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:02,214
Desperate times
truly do call for
desperate measures.

1131
01:05:02,214 --> 01:05:03,949
What brings you
to my sanctum?

1132
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:05,784
Come on, man,
just let me in.

1133
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:08,853
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Maybe the question is...

1134
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:10,588
Who brings you here?

1135
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:13,591
Really?
Your best friend, Matt.

1136
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:16,427
Remember me?

1137
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:19,863
All right. Good answer.

1138
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:21,798
Come in.

1139
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:23,232
Quickly.

1140
01:05:52,427 --> 01:05:54,695
We're all hurting.

1141
01:05:54,695 --> 01:06:00,400
I can feel this is
something beyond what
you can handle.

1142
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,035
Where is your strength,
your faith?

1143
01:06:03,035 --> 01:06:06,171
You have not visited
for some time, and yet
the church remains here,

1144
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:10,708
always here... for you.

1145
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:13,777
Still rambling gospel
rants I see, Dave.

1146
01:06:19,248 --> 01:06:22,684
Dude, don't mock my sh--

1147
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:26,454
stuff.

1148
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:28,255
My stuff is legit.

1149
01:06:29,689 --> 01:06:31,891
Because I have seen
the unknown

1150
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:33,492
in your unblinking eyes,

1151
01:06:33,492 --> 01:06:36,595
I have felt the shadows forming
into your childhood fears,

1152
01:06:36,595 --> 01:06:38,597
your heart, like a war drum,

1153
01:06:38,597 --> 01:06:41,232
beating frantically
to a distant, dying army,

1154
01:06:41,232 --> 01:06:43,701
the smell of...
( Laughing )

1155
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:46,537
See?
It's gettin' to ya.

1156
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:53,943
( Exhales )

1157
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,611
All right.

1158
01:06:58,947 --> 01:07:02,016
Jessica cheated on me.

1159
01:07:02,016 --> 01:07:04,084
With her boss.

1160
01:07:04,084 --> 01:07:07,987
Rich douchebag.

1161
01:07:07,987 --> 01:07:11,724
She took all my money.

1162
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:15,760
Now I've got mixed up
working for some mob
boss's son.

1163
01:07:17,762 --> 01:07:21,298
To top it off,
she aborted my child.

1164
01:07:22,198 --> 01:07:26,402
She aborted my...
Child, man!

1165
01:07:28,303 --> 01:07:29,837
( Heavy sigh )

1166
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,472
( Laughing )

1167
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:37,543
Well. Well... at
least she didn't
pay for the abortion

1168
01:07:37,543 --> 01:07:40,012
with the ring you got her.
I mean...

1169
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,646
( Chuckling )

1170
01:07:41,646 --> 01:07:42,847
No.

1171
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:45,583
She couldn't.

1172
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:49,553
O-Okay. This Princess
needs to die. Let's go.

1173
01:07:49,553 --> 01:07:53,990
No, let's just...
Just sit for a minute.

1174
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,224
Okay.

1175
01:07:55,224 --> 01:07:57,659
( Breathing deeply )

1176
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:09,803
I need a shot.

1177
01:08:09,803 --> 01:08:13,406
Nope.want a shot.
Do you want a shot?

1178
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:17,843
Yeah, I would love one.
Thank you.

1179
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,124
Is this kosher?

1180
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:38,360
Why do you think we're
always turning away?

1181
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,396
We're doing shots, son.

1182
01:08:41,396 --> 01:08:42,830
Bottoms up.

1183
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:48,634
My glass is broken.

1184
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,472
♪ Aaahhh ♪

1185
01:08:55,973 --> 01:08:58,075
Fixed!

1186
01:09:02,879 --> 01:09:04,647
Aah!

1187
01:09:04,647 --> 01:09:07,249
You know what?
I really...

1188
01:09:07,249 --> 01:09:09,384
I swear to god,
I fantasize.

1189
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:11,519
I fantasize about
killing her, man.

1190
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:15,456
Like, over and over
and over again in my head.

1191
01:09:15,456 --> 01:09:17,057
It's like thosaw movies.

1192
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:21,427
I want her to be every
character that dies
in those movies.

1193
01:09:21,427 --> 01:09:23,162
Well, one thing's for sure.

1194
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:25,063
I know.

1195
01:09:25,063 --> 01:09:26,964
She needs to die.

1196
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:28,065
No!

1197
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:30,834
( Scoffs )
Come on, man!

1198
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,802
Do you want to be
the villain?

1199
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,771
She's the villain!
She killed your child!

1200
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,406
We gotta do something
that's gonna last forever.

1201
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:40,174
A tattoo for the soul,

1202
01:09:40,174 --> 01:09:41,643
always reminding her
to watch her back.

1203
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:44,278
Fear is an amazing
art, my friend.

1204
01:09:44,278 --> 01:09:48,015
Very difficult to master,
but when done right,

1205
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:51,852
can give you
complete control.

1206
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:54,387
And really make
somebody's life crappy.

1207
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:55,554
( Laughs )

1208
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:57,889
What the hell do you
know about fear?

1209
01:09:59,223 --> 01:10:01,425
Everything.
I studied...

1210
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:04,327
Religion.

1211
01:10:04,327 --> 01:10:05,428
Good point.

1212
01:10:05,428 --> 01:10:07,930
Got any ideas?

1213
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:12,167
Not much.
Damn.

1214
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:15,370
Well, you know,
you said you were working
for that mafia boss.

1215
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,071
That's a good place
to start.

1216
01:10:17,071 --> 01:10:20,174
Yeah, except
Jessica's not having
any birthday parties.

1217
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,676
Birthday parties?

1218
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,612
Just forget about it.

1219
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:27,280
Are you friends with him?

1220
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,815
I don't know, man.

1221
01:10:29,815 --> 01:10:31,449
I guess.

1222
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:32,716
Well, you know who is.

1223
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:33,750
Money.

1224
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,318
We gotta get some.

1225
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:36,886
And no, Matt,
we're not gonna take money

1226
01:10:36,886 --> 01:10:38,787
out of the donation box,
okay? That is...

1227
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:41,156
I know, I know, I know.
It's yours.

1228
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:42,590
Ha.

1229
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:00,273
You hungry?

1230
01:11:00,273 --> 01:11:01,741
No.

1231
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:04,843
Want a pizza?

1232
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:07,411
No.

1233
01:11:07,411 --> 01:11:08,845
Okay.

1234
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:31,099
Wh... what is it?

1235
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:40,073
It's a vault code.

1236
01:11:40,073 --> 01:11:42,442
A vault code?

1237
01:11:42,442 --> 01:11:44,210
A vaul-- a vault code?

1238
01:11:50,382 --> 01:11:53,318
It's-- it's a vault code.
Holy crap!

1239
01:11:53,318 --> 01:11:55,986
( Both laughing )

1240
01:11:58,788 --> 01:12:02,158
Yup.
The plot thickens.

1241
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:03,959
Bee-itch.

1242
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,835
So, Peter cottontail,

1243
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:16,637
my boys told me
you really needed to talk.

1244
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:17,804
What's up?

1245
01:12:17,804 --> 01:12:21,340
Did he just
call me a rabbit?

1246
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,575
Gabor, how you doin', man?

1247
01:12:23,575 --> 01:12:26,311
Been good and bad.

1248
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:27,745
But mostly okay.

1249
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:29,980
What...
What does that mean?

1250
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,415
So, basically, you're
saying you're everything?

1251
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:34,583
It okay, Matt.

1252
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,585
Like woman's period.

1253
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,819
You go with flow.

1254
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:40,655
Dude, like, seriously,

1255
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,723
I mean, why can't you
just say river?

1256
01:12:42,723 --> 01:12:44,925
Yes, like river.

1257
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:47,127
And right now,
I am big fat beaver

1258
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:48,761
making tampon dam.

1259
01:12:48,761 --> 01:12:51,130
( Laughing )
Like, what the fuck?

1260
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,699
Where do you get
this shit from, man?

1261
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:55,167
Who's this?

1262
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,836
This is my buddy Dave.

1263
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:02,039
Uh...
Pleasure to meet you.

1264
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:03,740
I... I...

1265
01:13:04,607 --> 01:13:06,408
Pleasure to meet you.

1266
01:13:06,408 --> 01:13:08,143
Um....

1267
01:13:09,277 --> 01:13:11,212
Matt's told me
so much about you.

1268
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:13,113
Uh...

1269
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:15,682
Well, nothing
incriminating, you know.

1270
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:19,686
He just mentioned you,
uh, to me.

1271
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:22,855
Uh, only me, because
I'm his best friend,

1272
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:25,891
you know, and-- and
I wouldn't say anything.

1273
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:28,560
And... I'm not wired.

1274
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,362
If that's what you're thinking.
Jesus, Dave!

1275
01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:35,565
( Stammering )
Dave! Mellow out, man!
Come on!

1276
01:13:35,565 --> 01:13:37,233
Calm down, man.

1277
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:39,335
God!

1278
01:13:39,335 --> 01:13:40,803
Relax.

1279
01:13:55,884 --> 01:13:58,186
What are you worried about?

1280
01:14:02,089 --> 01:14:04,291
Going to heaven?

1281
01:14:15,268 --> 01:14:17,970
Well, uh...

1282
01:14:22,474 --> 01:14:26,010
I just hear the lines
are pretty long
this time of year.

1283
01:14:29,646 --> 01:14:33,716
( Laughing )
Hey, this guy's funny!

1284
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:37,752
Like you. Maybe we
put him in suit.

1285
01:14:37,752 --> 01:14:41,321
Yeah, he loves easter,
too, you know?

1286
01:14:42,322 --> 01:14:43,956
Um, again,
with the rabbit?

1287
01:14:43,956 --> 01:14:46,191
Um, is this some sort
of mafia code?

1288
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,692
Not mafia!

1289
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,194
Eastern European
organization.

1290
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:52,529
O... Kay.

1291
01:14:53,763 --> 01:14:58,601
Okay, clowns,
what are you doing here?

1292
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,035
Tell him.

1293
01:15:01,436 --> 01:15:02,937
All right, look.

1294
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,773
I, uh, came across something
that might interest you,

1295
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,708
and I thought we could
trade for it.

1296
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:11,410
Matt, you are like
full-time employee
already.

1297
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:14,579
I didn't know who else
to go to.

1298
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:17,081
Okay.

1299
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,784
Before we get going,
you need to know:

1300
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:23,920
If you fuck me,
I fuck you. Harder.

1301
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,289
I don't want to fuck you.

1302
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,658
No, you don't, because I
fuck everyone in this city

1303
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:30,459
who tries to fuck me.

1304
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,163
Understood.

1305
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:38,299
Good. Now what the fuck
do you guys want?

1306
01:15:38,299 --> 01:15:39,533
Look.

1307
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:47,240
What is this?

1308
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,409
It's a code
to a vault in a bank,

1309
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:54,045
and since i'm
not a bank robber,

1310
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:56,313
I thought it might
interest you.

1311
01:15:58,348 --> 01:16:00,083
I have plenty of money.

1312
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:02,085
I have no need
to Rob bank.

1313
01:16:03,619 --> 01:16:08,623
Listen. Gabor, this isn't
robbing a bank, okay?

1314
01:16:08,623 --> 01:16:10,324
This is winning the lotto.

1315
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:12,326
It's a cakewalk.

1316
01:16:12,326 --> 01:16:14,895
You're not dealing
with panicked managers
fumbling keys.

1317
01:16:14,895 --> 01:16:16,930
There's no hero guards
ready to shoot.

1318
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,232
The place barely
has any employees.

1319
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:22,534
We don't
even want the money.

1320
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:25,370
So, why?

1321
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,305
We want you

1322
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:31,408
to scare the living
daylights out of his girl.

1323
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:32,876
Trauma!

1324
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:36,212
So the bitch works
in the bank, huh,
bunny boy?

1325
01:16:36,212 --> 01:16:39,481
And you want big,
scary eastern European
organization

1326
01:16:39,481 --> 01:16:41,149
to make her sorry.

1327
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:43,417
Yeah. Let her know that
you'll always be watching.

1328
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:46,319
Make her question every
decision in her life,

1329
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,154
and then
tell her one day,

1330
01:16:48,154 --> 01:16:51,857
finally,
you will come for her.

1331
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,026
And what religion are you?

1332
01:16:55,026 --> 01:16:57,528
It's a progressive branch.

1333
01:16:57,528 --> 01:16:59,796
We call it...

1334
01:16:59,796 --> 01:17:02,431
If you fuck my friend,
I fuck you!

1335
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:15,943
This I understand.

1336
01:17:15,943 --> 01:17:17,945
The urban dictionary
defines

1337
01:17:17,945 --> 01:17:21,214
the modern use of
the word "clusterfuck"

1338
01:17:21,214 --> 01:17:24,984
as any situation with
a large scale of disarray.

1339
01:17:28,253 --> 01:17:29,887
Yup.

1340
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,628
Yo, what time is it, man?

1341
01:17:38,628 --> 01:17:42,431
( Sighs )
Guess he must be stuck
in traffic or something.

1342
01:17:43,432 --> 01:17:45,233
I don't know.

1343
01:17:45,233 --> 01:17:48,803
I don't know.
I'm worried, man.

1344
01:17:48,803 --> 01:17:53,373
Look, they're only
two minutes late.
It'll be all right.

1345
01:17:53,373 --> 01:17:58,443
Okay.

1346
01:18:10,654 --> 01:18:12,155
Ohh!

1347
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,631
Here we go!

1348
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,741
I can't believe this
is happening, man.

1349
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:37,144
I swear to god,
I hope that bitch
has a heart attack.

1350
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:40,680
I'm gonna have
a heart attack, okay?

1351
01:18:42,515 --> 01:18:45,251
( Chuckling )

1352
01:18:58,063 --> 01:19:00,331
Hey, hey.

1353
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:05,902
No problem.

1354
01:19:05,902 --> 01:19:07,503
Glad I'm here.

1355
01:19:13,342 --> 01:19:17,778
You remember that time
we robbed that video store

1356
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:19,780
and we stole those pogs?

1357
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,381
God!
( Both laughing )

1358
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,916
I've never seen you
so scared, man.

1359
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:25,817
I've never.
I wasn't that scared.
Come on.

1360
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:29,387
Dude, I've never seen you
more scared in my life.

1361
01:19:29,387 --> 01:19:31,055
You were about to
shit your pants.

1362
01:19:31,055 --> 01:19:34,558
You were being
such a little bitch!

1363
01:19:34,558 --> 01:19:37,160
I think that's when I
decided to become a priest.

1364
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,195
( Both laughing )

1365
01:19:40,995 --> 01:19:42,496
Pogs!

1366
01:19:43,497 --> 01:19:44,631
Pogs were cool.

1367
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:48,634
Oh, they were swell,
weren't they?

1368
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,938
( Gunshots )
Holy mother of god!

1369
01:19:53,938 --> 01:19:55,606
Holy--!
( Screaming )

1370
01:19:55,606 --> 01:19:56,640
Wha--?

1371
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,608
( Screams and gunfire )

1372
01:19:58,608 --> 01:20:01,277
( Cellphone rings )
Who's that?

1373
01:20:01,277 --> 01:20:03,379
Gabor: Matt!
What?

1374
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:06,815
The shit's
going real bad!
Matt? What?

1375
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:08,516
Fuck!
Matt!

1376
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:09,817
Matt!

1377
01:20:09,817 --> 01:20:11,819
Holy--!

1378
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:14,688
Father, forgive me.

1379
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:22,327
Ohh...!

1380
01:20:22,327 --> 01:20:23,795
Oh, god.

1381
01:20:23,795 --> 01:20:26,631
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1382
01:20:26,631 --> 01:20:28,866
What the fuck? Fuck!

1383
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:32,869
Gabor: God! Shit!

1384
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:35,471
I'm not fucking!

1385
01:20:35,471 --> 01:20:37,406
Calm down, please,
Gabor. Let's think
about this.

1386
01:20:37,406 --> 01:20:40,542
Everyone
is gonna get fucked!

1387
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:42,010
Gabor.
Gabor.

1388
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:44,312
( Indistinct shouts )

1389
01:20:44,312 --> 01:20:46,613
Get outta here, man.
Go, go.

1390
01:20:49,549 --> 01:20:52,618
I told you!
I told you if you fuck me,

1391
01:20:52,618 --> 01:20:54,553
I will fuck you harder!

1392
01:20:54,553 --> 01:20:56,655
Dave: Please,
forgive them.
Gabor: You understand me?

1393
01:20:56,655 --> 01:20:58,323
What am I gonna tell
my father? Huh?!

1394
01:20:58,323 --> 01:21:00,258
( Indistinct remark )

1395
01:21:04,061 --> 01:21:05,629
Matt: We can
get out of this!

1396
01:21:05,629 --> 01:21:07,230
Gabor: What am I gonna
tell my father?

1397
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,799
Gabor, please!
I don't wanna die!

1398
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:17,171
Jesus!
What the fuck
is going on here?

1399
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:18,405
Please.

1400
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:20,874
Are you part of this, Matt?

1401
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:26,544
Drop the gun, bitch!

1402
01:21:26,544 --> 01:21:27,945
Dave:
Please, Gabor! Gabor!

1403
01:21:27,945 --> 01:21:30,047
Matt: Please...
Please...

1404
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:32,582
Drop the fucking gun!
Please.

1405
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:34,750
Jessica, just drop
the gun, okay?

1406
01:21:36,318 --> 01:21:38,687
Jessica: ...Fuck up, Dave!
Shut up, Dave!

1407
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:41,423
I'm not waiting.

1408
01:21:41,423 --> 01:21:42,657
I will fuckin' kill you.

1409
01:21:42,657 --> 01:21:44,058
No! No.

1410
01:21:44,058 --> 01:21:47,161
Please.

1411
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:48,695
Please, not her.

1412
01:21:51,497 --> 01:21:53,232
Matt.

1413
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:57,568
What?

1414
01:21:57,568 --> 01:21:59,736
You gave up!

1415
01:22:01,871 --> 01:22:05,273
What did you expect? Huh?

1416
01:22:06,874 --> 01:22:08,741
Love.

1417
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,277
Respect.

1418
01:22:18,382 --> 01:22:21,952
Baby, you loved me.

1419
01:22:21,952 --> 01:22:24,220
I loved you so much.

1420
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:29,224
You know what I wanted?

1421
01:22:30,191 --> 01:22:33,694
Was a little fucking loyalty.

1422
01:22:36,897 --> 01:22:38,732
I.. I'm done.

1423
01:22:38,732 --> 01:22:39,833
I'm done.

1424
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,769
Okay?

1425
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:45,638
It's over, it's over.
It's done. Just--

1426
01:22:45,638 --> 01:22:47,806
fuck you, Dave!
Fuck you!

1427
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:52,609
Go, quietly. Go.

1428
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:54,077
No!

1429

( Gunshots )

1430

Dave: Come on!

1435
01:23:38,648 --> 01:23:39,882
Wow.

1436
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:46,353
I guess this is the part

1437
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:50,122
where I'm supposed
to ask for forgiveness,

1438
01:23:50,122 --> 01:23:52,124
say I'm sorry

1439
01:23:52,124 --> 01:23:53,792
for all the things
I've done

1440
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:56,995
and all the people
I've hurt?

1441
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:04,401
I didn't want her dead,
okay?

1442
01:24:04,401 --> 01:24:05,769
I didn't.

1443
01:24:05,769 --> 01:24:07,303
But...

1444
01:24:07,303 --> 01:24:08,804
The world...

1445
01:24:08,804 --> 01:24:13,174
Will be a much,
much better place

1446
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:15,776
without people like her
walking around.

1447
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:09,528
( Gasps )
Holy shit!

1448
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:12,297
Matt, I don't think
I've introduced myself.

1449
01:25:12,297 --> 01:25:14,332
Michael.

1450
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:17,034
Hi.

1451
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:18,602
I'm fucked.

1452
01:25:18,602 --> 01:25:22,706
Well, my colleagues, they
aren't charmed about you.

1453
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:25,842
( Mirthless chuckle )
No kidding.

1454
01:25:25,842 --> 01:25:31,713
The ruling suggests that
we sentence you to
eternal damnation.

1455
01:25:31,713 --> 01:25:33,981
( Clicks tongue )
Fantastic.

1456
01:25:35,248 --> 01:25:39,618
But I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

1457
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:42,287
I got plenty of time.

1458
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:44,722
That's cute.
That's funny.

1459
01:25:45,923 --> 01:25:48,325
They've been watching you
from upstairs,

1460
01:25:48,325 --> 01:25:51,394
and, well, they were
particularly taken

1461
01:25:51,394 --> 01:25:54,163
by what you said
at the end there.

1462
01:25:54,163 --> 01:25:55,430
Mm-hmm?

1463
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,398
That the world would be
a better place

1464
01:25:57,398 --> 01:25:58,999
without women like Jessica.

1465
01:25:58,999 --> 01:26:00,466
We agree with you.

1466
01:26:02,868 --> 01:26:04,202
You do?

1467
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:05,703
We do.

1468
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:07,304
We'd like you
to work for US.

1469
01:26:07,304 --> 01:26:10,707
Matt, the world
has become infected:

1470
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:14,410
Adultery, lies, greed,
corruption.

1471
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:16,545
The lands are
overrun with sin.

1472
01:26:16,545 --> 01:26:19,581
We considered taking away
life altogether.

1473
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:23,217
But while we all
agree that mankind
has been corrupted,

1474
01:26:23,217 --> 01:26:26,453
there are a lot of
good people left trying
to hold it all together.

1475
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:28,087
It isn't fair to them.

1476
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:32,590
So for them, we'd like
to help clean up the mess.

1477
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:38,695
Matt, we need someone
to act on our behalf.

1478
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:43,432
So...

1479
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:46,101
You want me to be
your hit man?

1480
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,502
Exactly.

1481
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:53,974
And you want me to get rid
of the liars

1482
01:26:53,974 --> 01:26:56,710
and cheats and whores?

1483
01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:59,612
Exactly, Matt.
Clean house.

1484
01:26:59,612 --> 01:27:01,481
What if I don't?

1485
01:27:01,481 --> 01:27:03,349
Eternal damnation.

( Chuckling )

1487
01:27:06,218 --> 01:27:09,287
That's a tough choice.

1488
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:10,788
When do I start?

1489
01:27:10,788 --> 01:27:13,723
Right away.
With Jessica.

1490
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,157
What?

1491
01:27:16,157 --> 01:27:17,958
She survived her wounds.

1492
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:21,027
If she recovers, if she
enters the world again,

1493
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:24,163
she'll hurt others.

1494
01:27:24,163 --> 01:27:25,864
May I ask you a question?

1495
01:27:26,731 --> 01:27:29,033
Why did you step
in front of her?

1496
01:27:29,033 --> 01:27:32,002
You protected her.
Why did you do that?

1497
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:40,008
I trust it will not
be an issue.

1498
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:44,211
We'll be watching.

1499
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:48,581
What?!

1500
01:27:48,581 --> 01:27:49,915
I know, man.

1501
01:27:49,915 --> 01:27:52,651
I mean, it's hard
for me to believe, too.

1502
01:27:52,651 --> 01:27:54,619
No, no. Bullshit!

1503
01:27:54,619 --> 01:27:57,254
Look, man,
they gave me a list.

1504
01:27:58,588 --> 01:28:01,958
This thing's long.

1505
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:04,260
How long?

1506
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:07,296
Oh, boy.

1507
01:28:07,296 --> 01:28:09,765
About two bloody
murderous years.

1508
01:28:09,765 --> 01:28:14,169
I mean, if you think
about it, I had to die...

1509
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:18,072
To figure out what
I was supposed to do.

1510
01:28:18,072 --> 01:28:21,975
Guess... better late
than never, right?

1511
01:28:21,975 --> 01:28:23,710
Jesus, man.

1512
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:26,412
Nah, nah, he already
did his thing.

1513
01:28:26,412 --> 01:28:29,081
Between you and me...

1514
01:28:29,081 --> 01:28:31,917
I don't think he really
thought it through
the first time.

1515
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:35,687
Well, if he had, I'd be
out of a job, right?

1516
01:28:35,687 --> 01:28:38,656
Hold on.
Jessica isn't dead.

1517
01:28:40,224 --> 01:28:41,959
Yeah.

1518

you could say she's...

1521
01:28:51,867 --> 01:28:53,869

Well... let me see.

1524

for a second. It's...

to some bad shit lately.

1533
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,375
I didn't want to do this--
what the fuck?!

to do this to a friend.

kill me right here
