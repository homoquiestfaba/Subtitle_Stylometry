363
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:35,068
I came here,
to study the martial arts.

364
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:37,068
I ended up doing repairs.

365
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:41,620
>> Teaching the martial arts
is a great responsibility.

366
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:44,034
I have had students

367
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:47,862
who have gone
and done bad things.

368
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:50,206
Evil things.

369
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:54,931
A true martial artist
uses his skill

370
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:59,482
only to defend himself
or someone else.

371
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:02,241
>> You thought I was
some kind of an ignorant jerk?

372
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,310
>> I still do.

373
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,448
That's fine, Lyle.

374
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:09,103
Don't be afraid of ignorance.

375
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:13,241
Be afraid
of not wanting to learn.

376
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:16,413
>> I want to learn.
I want to earn a red sash.

377
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,965
>> Yes, but why do you
want to earn a red sash?

378
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,620
>> Because I've always
been afraid to try

379
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:27,000
for the first time in my life,
I'm taking a chance.

380
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,310
>> If you can take a chance,

381
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,172
I guess I can take a chance.

382
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,344
Now clean up the mess.

383
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:49,172
>> Foreign drug lords,

384
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:51,344
maybe they're
importing the stuff somehow.

385
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:54,172
>> Maybe they're
importing the stuff somehow.

386
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:55,517
You're hopeless.

387
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,620
You haven't got a clue
what you're doing.

388
00:34:57,655 --> 00:34:59,241
>> Don't be so hard on the boy.

389
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:01,275
This is a very tough assignment.

390
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,172
>> Mr. Crump, sir.

391
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:06,482
Peng's been on this assignment
for several months.

392
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:08,310
So far,
he's come up with nothing.

393
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:12,103
Meanwhile, murder's up,
theft is up, rape is up.

394
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,482
>> I'm very well aware of
the severity of this problem,

395
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:17,344
but I don't want you
getting the force into a panic.

396
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,448
Peng.>> Yes, sir.

397
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:19,896
Carry on
with your investigation.

398
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,000
You'll turn something up.

399
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,482
>> Thank you, sir.
I'll do that.

400
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:23,655
>> This is absurd.

401
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,724
He's either totally unqualified
or he's on the take.

402
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,965
>> I'll be the judge of who's
qualified and who is not.

403
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,413
As for being on the take.

404
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:33,379
You better be
bloody well sure of yourself

405
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:36,034
before you make
an accusation like that.

406
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,758
>> Yes, sir.

407
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:59,000
[soft music]

408
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,689
>> You say you want to earn
a red sash.

409
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:05,206
Well, let's see.

>> You're learning fast,
but you're way to stiff.

415
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,034
You have to learn to flow.>> The flow.

416
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:24,310
>> Yeah.

417
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,206
It's different between Kung Fu
and any other martial arts.

418
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:33,344
Up on the mountain,

419
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:37,068
Do Man's son trains there
with his daughter.

420
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,793
He's a master.

421
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,827
Maybe he'll teach you something.

[dramatic music]

423
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:30,000
>> What are you
doing here anyways?

424
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,862
>> I'm here studying
with Do Man.

425
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:34,896
>> Why Do Man, why here?

426
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,241
>> Because it's a challenge.

427
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,655
I was supposed to get married.

428
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:43,517
Real pretty girl.

429
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:46,931
I was supposed to take over my
father's business, make money.

430
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:48,620
>> That sounds good.

431
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:49,655
>> Nah!

432
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:54,241
It was all too easy.

433
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:56,620
My brother died.

434
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,103
That made me see that

435
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:02,206
life is about taking chances.

436
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:03,896
>> What happened to him?

437
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:07,344
>> He overdosed on
some new street drug

438
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,206
it's called Nirvana.

439
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:14,206
>> That's, that's too bad.

440
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:23,172
>> Let's go out tonight.

441
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,793
>> I don't go out at night.

442
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:27,103
>> Why not?

443
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:29,482
>> I'm, I'm busy.

>> How's it coming?

445
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,965
>> It's complicated.

446
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,586
It will take some time.

447
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,103
>> How long?

448
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,310
>> These formulas
took me nine years to develop.

449
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,448
It will not be ready tomorrow.

450
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:48,137
>> How long, how long?

451
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:49,586
>> Few months, at least.

452
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,448
>> A few months, a few months.

453
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:57,655
Okay, keep working Ren.

and you don't go home with a
few bruises and good lessons,

465
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:36,206
you get killed.

466

471
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:52,482
>> I saw that guy at the Jag,
an expensive nightclub.

472
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:54,517
He was drinking champagne
with some drug dealer.

473

00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:40,862
>> What's this about monks?

545
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,034
>> We were at
the monks temple this morning

546
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,862
we thought they might be
connected to a drug ring

547
00:56:44,896 --> 00:56:46,275
called Black Pearls.

548
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,413
>> Black Pearls.

549
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:50,137
I remember those guys from Nam.

550
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:52,482
Ran opium through the jungles.

551
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:55,310
Bad dudes man,
real bad dudes.

552
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:57,034
>> I know, I saw them
with that drug dealer.

553
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:58,413
I know I did.

554
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,724
>> Wait a minute Lyle.

555
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:01,137
Are you trying to say
the Black Pearls

556
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:02,344
are back in business?

557
00:57:02,379 --> 00:57:04,413
>> I don't know,
but I'd like to find out.

558
00:57:04,448 --> 00:57:06,793
>> Don't bother me
with anymore, Black Pearl talk.

559
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,655
Far as I'm concerned,
this case is closed.

560
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:11,034
I'm going down the station,
finalize my report,

561
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:12,413
and you guys aren't coming?

562
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,310
No way, no how,
positively not.

563
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:16,344
>> This has got to be

564
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,655
the stupidest thing
you've ever concocted.

565
00:57:18,689 --> 00:57:20,310
>> But he's a
notorious drug king.

566
00:57:20,344 --> 00:57:21,551
>> It's the other guys,

567
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:23,896
the ones with
the bald heads and the robes.

568
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:25,206
They're monks.

569
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,413
I can't believe
you raided their temple.

570
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,241
We're going to take
a lot of crap out of this.

571
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:30,551
>> I have an eyewitness
who says,

572
00:57:30,586 --> 00:57:32,172
two of these so-called monks,

573
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:33,689
were seen
with this drug dealer.

574
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:35,344
I have an informant who says

575
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:37,862
Black Pearl society have
a long history of drug dealing.

576
00:57:37,896 --> 00:57:39,413
I have...>> All right.

577
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:42,034
I'm going to take down
your eye witness statements.

578
00:57:42,068 --> 00:57:44,724
Not because I think
you've got any credibility,

579
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:47,965
but because I want to prove
to some people upstairs,

580
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,827
what a complete idiot you are.

581
00:57:56,689 --> 00:57:58,172
>> What do you think
will happen?

582
00:57:58,206 --> 00:57:59,172
>> Who knows?

583
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,034
They do things
slow at the station.

584
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:03,827
>> Hey guys,
it's probably nothing.

585
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,551
Anyone could go around calling
themselves the Black Pearls.

586
00:58:06,586 --> 00:58:07,931
>> Right. What does
it really prove

587
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:10,793
that they get the statues
at the corner store, you know?

588
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:14,413
>> If they're consorting
with drug dealers,

589
00:58:14,448 --> 00:58:17,931
somebody has to go
to the temple and stop them.

590
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:19,172
>> Nothing personal Lyle.

591
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:20,620
But it was a long time ago.

592
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:22,068
And you were upset
when you thought

593
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:23,827
you saw them at the nightclub.

594
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:25,586
>> I did see them together.

595
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,793
I know I did.

596
00:58:26,827 --> 00:58:28,827

[telephone ringing]

599
00:58:45,413 --> 00:58:46,586
>> Yeah!

600
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:52,275
Come on, they're onto us.

601
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:53,827
We've got to stop them.

602
00:58:56,517 --> 00:58:59,172
>> So long.>> Bye-bye, goodnight.

603
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,827
>> What's this scenic route?

604
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:09,827
>> That's good.

605
00:59:09,862 --> 00:59:11,310
Short cut, keep it moving.

606
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:14,344
[dog barking]

607
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:22,586
>> This place sure is
spooky at night, huh?

608
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,965
>> Ah, what's this place got
that my neighborhood ain't got?

609
00:59:28,655 --> 00:59:30,000
>> Black Pearls.

610
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:34,000
[men grunting and yelling]

611
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:44,068

[sirens wailing]

613
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:26,344
>> Lyle, police watch out.

614
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:43,758
>> Did somebody forget to leave
a tip at the restaurant or what?

615
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:46,310
>> Bailey!

616
01:00:46,344 --> 01:00:49,275
Oh boy, Bailey,
you corrupt bastard.

617
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,275
>> Bailey!

618
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,448
>> My boss, the one
who took our testimony,

619
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:56,689
he's the only one who knows our
Black Pearl drug ring theory.

620
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,241
>> He's connected to them.

621
01:00:58,275 --> 01:00:59,620

>> Bailey!

625
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:09,310
What are you up to?

626
01:01:09,344 --> 01:01:10,689
>> What are you babbling about?

627
01:01:10,724 --> 01:01:13,206
>> Black Pearls paid us a visit,
that's what I'm babbling about.

628
01:01:13,241 --> 01:01:16,241
>> You're still going on about
that Black Pearls rubbish?

629
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:22,137
>> Who did you show
that report to?

630
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:24,827
>> Only Crump
and he had a good laugh.

631
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:26,758
>> The Black Pearls know
we're onto them.

632
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,448
>> Oh, yeah.

633
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:32,137
And what are they
going to do about it?

634
01:01:32,172 --> 01:01:33,172
[car engine starting]

635
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:42,689

>> Salamaar,
what are you doing here?

637
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:50,620
>> Why didn't you
tell us about them?

638
01:01:50,655 --> 01:01:53,206
>> I, I didn't think
it was important.

639
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:55,137
They don't even
get their facts straight.

640
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:58,517
They think you're dealing
with an American named Jerome.

641
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,310
Salamaar, you'll need me.

642
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,482
>> Like all
important businesses,

643
01:02:06,517 --> 01:02:08,482
we're leaving Hong Kong.

644
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,965
>> You used me you bastard.

645
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,655
<< Boh, gun!

646
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,551
You're not
a true Black Pearl anyway.

647
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:23,793
A true Black Pearl
doesn't need a gun.

648
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,310
But sometimes,
like to use them,

649
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:28,137
just for fun.

650
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:29,137

652
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:34,206
>> So that is what they do.

653
01:02:34,241 --> 01:02:35,482
>> You know, them?

654
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:38,551
>> Boh used to be
a student here.

655
01:02:38,586 --> 01:02:42,000
He was recruited
into some organization

656
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:44,827
a short time
before you arrived.

657
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:49,034
If, they are responsible
for this drug problem,

658
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:51,586
I say kick their butt.

659
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,862
>> But you
said that a martial artist

660
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,965
should use his skill only to.

661
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,413
>> Yes, Lyle

662
01:02:57,448 --> 01:03:02,344
you must defend
our street, our cure.

666
01:03:27,413 --> 01:03:29,586
What's in there?

667
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,586
>> Jesus!

668
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,931
>> Jacques, what do you see?

669
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:34,517
>> It's her the girl
from the teahouse.>> Who?

670
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:35,793
>> Loritza, Loritza!

671
01:03:35,827 --> 01:03:37,827
She's with the Black Pearls.

672
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:44,517
No wonder
you didn't find anything.

673
01:03:46,413 --> 01:03:48,586
>> Let's trash them.>> No!

674
01:03:49,448 --> 01:03:51,000
I've got a plan.

675
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:52,551
Okay!

676
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:56,068
>> You should quit the teahouse
and work for me, full time.

677
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:57,344
We are going to expand

678
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:58,896
and you can have
an important place

679
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:01,137
in the new operation.

680
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:04,172
I want you to love me,
i want you with me.

we got ourselves a rematch.

01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:24,103
I see you have
earned your red sash.

>> You haven't
finished learning.

>> Yes, but I have
my red sash.

698
01:07:31,344 --> 01:07:33,344
What else is there to learn?

699
01:07:45,517 --> 01:07:48,517
>> A red sash is not everything.

700
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,482
Yes, and lots more to learn.

701
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:56,000
Punch!

702
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:04,172
You are tense, relax.

703
01:08:06,172 --> 01:08:10,000
See, you react fast
because you lose.

704
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:14,241
>> What else?

705
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:17,103

If you would
take the center first,

01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,344
you win.

709
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,068
Relax!

710
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:04,689
Relax!

01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:21,862
>> Why would you
teach me all this?

712
01:09:28,068 --> 01:09:30,034
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
our captain and crew,

713
01:09:30,068 --> 01:09:32,482
Hope you enjoyed
your stay in Hong Kong.

714
01:09:32,517 --> 01:09:34,724
Please make sure
your seat belts are fastened

718
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:47,551
>> Yeah!

719
01:09:47,586 --> 01:09:50,551
>> Nah, you deserve
a corner office.

720
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:54,931
You're going to be taking on
a huge responsibility here,

721
01:09:54,965 --> 01:09:57,137
>> Responsibility.

722
01:09:57,172 --> 01:09:58,862
I'm not used to that.
