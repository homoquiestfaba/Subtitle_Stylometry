00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,023
to read the stupid report, you'd have

554
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:44,900
found out that they put the time of the murder

555
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:46,081
between 9:00 and 9:15.

556
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:50,843
Don't tell me you suspect--

557
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:52,477
No, no.

558
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:56,404
But you know how hungry the press gets for a crazed cop

559
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,698
that's cracked under pressure.

560
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,853
So find Jack.

561
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,660
Look, you can't keep him at a desk, even if he--

562
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,920
Look, just find him, OK?

563
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:07,421
I'll give you 48 hours to catch this guy.

564
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,161
But just 48 hours.

565
00:37:09,264 --> 00:37:10,759
And if not, you're going to find yourselves

566
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,149
working animal control down at Venice

567
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:13,678
Beach for the next five years.

568
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:23,376
Oh, and one more thing.

569
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,009
Could you bring this guy in alive this time?

570
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:30,465
Yeah.

571
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:31,404
Yeah.

572
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:32,482
Woo.

573
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,532
Shake that stuff.

574
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,757
Tony, Tony, she's really good

575
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,113
Joe.

576
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:38,947
OK.

577
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:42,248
OK, yeah.

578
00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:43,048
OK.

579
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,647
Do a little spin.

580
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,215
Nice.

581
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:52,189
Fine.

582
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:53,823
Well, uh-- we'll call you.

583
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:54,622
Thanks.

584
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:57,193
Thank you.

585
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:58,167
OK.

586
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:00,010
Next.

587
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:05,396
[music - trapper, "ride it"]

588
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,395
When I walked into the room, I had

589
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,331
a feeling you'd be waiting for a chance

590
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:01,009
to put your chains on me.

591
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:10,392
Don't you know you'll never tie me down.

592
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:11,435
Yeah.

593
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:12,478
Nice.

594
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:15,571
--however, whenever I please.

595
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:20,193
Hit the road and I'm riding.

596
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:23,913
Ride it out.

597
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:27,040
Ride it.

598
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:28,779
Ride it out.

599
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,942
Hey, Tony, look at this.

600
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,401
Tony.

601
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,375
Whew!

602
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,553
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

603
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,952
Kill the music.

604
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:44,419
Kill it!

605
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:46,365
DANCER: What, did I do something wrong?

606
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:47,791
Should I start over?

607
00:39:47,895 --> 00:39:48,903
No, honey.

608
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:52,273
See, this is a couples club, and that's--

609
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:54,499
that's more of a singles routine.

610
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,236
So let's just leave it like that, OK?

611
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,174
OK.

612
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:02,528
What do we have here, a re-enactment?

613
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:03,709
Hey, listen, do you mind?

614
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:04,892
We have a business to run here.

615
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:06,351
And do you mind?

616
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:08,506
We've got some lives to save around here.

617
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,765
Oh, oh, pluck my heartstrings, why don't you?

618
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,877
Hey, listen, Tony.

619
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:13,928
Who let Mother Teresa in here?

620
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:16,117
How is this for your heartstring pluck?

621
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:17,368
Yo, man, be cool.

622
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:18,585
JACK: Listen to me.

623
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,080
If you don't start cooperating, we're

624
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,539
going to have you up there doing your own swan dance.

625
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:22,512
Whoa. Cool it.

626
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:24,598
Come on.

627
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:26,022
OK, cool it.

628
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:29,012
Look, if you kill him, Hatch'll have you

629
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:30,333
dig his grave with a teaspoon.

630
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,219
Come on.

631
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,026
Let's go interview the dancers, see if anybody saw anything.

632
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,101
JOE: OK, next!

633
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:05,924
Hi.

634
00:41:06,027 --> 00:41:06,724
Hi.

635
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:09,156
You still auditioning?

636
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,145
I thought you, uh, already had this job?

637
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,815
I'm practicing.

638
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,351
Are you here to ask me some more vital questions?

639
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:17,429
Yeah.

640
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:20,766
You want to tell me about last night?

641
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,303
What about it?

642
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:27,160
How about you just tell me what happened.

643
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:31,088
Well, I know that you went home alone.

644
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,348
And you?

645
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,607
I know about that, too.

646
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:36,926
Excuse me.

647
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:38,143
We have a murder to discuss.

648
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,916
Do you think maybe we could do that?

649
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:50,135
Is there anything-- anything-- unusual you can tell us?

650
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:56,043
Well, sure, I guess everything I see around here is unusual.

651
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,887
But if you're asking me if I saw anyone

652
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,971
in the ladies' room washing blood off their hands,

653
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:02,021
I didn't.

654
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:03,204
Thanks.

655
00:42:03,308 --> 00:42:05,219
She's all yours.

656
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:06,505
Listen.

657
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,931
I'd really like you to call me if you can remember

658
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:10,155
anything about last night.

659
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:12,170
Anything that'll help us at all.

660
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:13,943
All right?

661
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:15,647
Sure.

662
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:17,906
And there is one more thing.

663
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,087
Yeah?

664
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:20,025
Dinner tonight?

665
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,443
Well, you know, I could take you in for questioning.

666
00:42:33,547 --> 00:42:34,798
And then you'd have to have dinner.

667
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:41,957
[screaming]

668
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:44,739
My God, Tony!

669
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,476
You practically scared the life out of me.

670
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,213
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

671
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:49,291
But you just snuck up and I--

672
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:50,613
TONY: Where you going, baby?

673
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:51,897
I'm quitting.

674
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,844
TONY: Is that right?

675
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,408
MIKE: Freeze!

676
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:56,208
Don't shoot!

677
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:57,703
He didn't [inaudible].

678
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,406
He just scared me. That's all.

679
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,899
It's dangerous being here.

680
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:02,256
I was just-- - Shut up!

681
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,515
TONY: OK, you listen-- - Just shut up!

682
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:12,265
Look, sit down.

683
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,212
Both of you.

684
00:43:14,316 --> 00:43:15,255
Will you?

685
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:24,153
We want the girls that danced last night.

686
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:26,307
The rest of you can go on doing what you were doing.

687
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:34,580
MIKE: Thanks very much.

688
00:43:34,685 --> 00:43:37,186
I can't tell you how helpful you've been.

689
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,554
So you, uh, danced last night, huh?

690
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,852
I don't think you qualify as one of the girls.

691
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:06,904
Sometimes you just can't do anything right.

692
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,841
You're Kim, aren't you?

693
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:25,603
You were the one who was--

694
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:31,477
she was your friend.

695
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:42,425
You can go.

696
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:50,002
Just, um, leave an address and phone number with the police

697
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:50,940
out front.

698
00:44:57,509 --> 00:44:59,143
I hope you get him.

699
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:22,292
Ladies, names?

700
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:23,543
Rosella.

701
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:24,481
Rose.

702
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:26,671
- Rose. - Candi.

703
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,061
Candi.

704
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:32,892
See anyone backstage or in the dressing room area anytime

705
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,352
last night?

706
00:45:34,456 --> 00:45:36,612
Anyone at all that shouldn't have been here?

707
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:38,523
- You. - Great.

708
00:45:38,627 --> 00:45:39,843
Now I'm the prime suspect.

709
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:41,686
At least we'll have something to offer Hatch

710
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,084
now after a day of digging.

711
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:46,100
Well, then I guess you'll all just excuse me

712
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:50,097
while I go fingerprint myself.

713
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:51,209
Handle this?

714
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:01,949
Know of anyone who had any run-ins with the victim?

715
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:03,444
Arguments?

716
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:04,694
Men she turned down?

717
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,606
I think she never turned anyone down.

718
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:12,063
Maybe your friend should've knocked on her door last night.

719
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:14,079
You don't seem to like him very much.

720
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:15,782
Any reason?

721
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:16,964
Relax, doll.

722
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:19,606
Just call it professional jealousy.

723
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,378
But you know, the only one that riles any of us

724
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:24,124
is that new girl your friend's hot for, Kaycha.

725
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:25,757
KIM: [screaming]

726
00:46:26,835 --> 00:46:29,859
Kim must've saw her shadow again.

727
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:31,389
Anyway, I better check it out.

728
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:32,431
I'll be right back.

729
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:35,107
KAYCHA: [screaming]

730
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:51,756
Is she dead?

731
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,707
You tell me.

732
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:00,098
Oh, come on, Mike.

733
00:47:00,202 --> 00:47:02,287
No, you come on, Jack.

734
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:05,728
Till we know better, everyone's a suspect.

735
00:47:05,832 --> 00:47:07,953
Look, you think you could do this without getting

736
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:10,247
blood all over the place?

737
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:11,533
Mike, you want a prime suspect?

738
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:12,784
Go find Tony.

739
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:14,869
Oh, you saw the way he acted in there.

740
00:47:14,974 --> 00:47:16,468
He wouldn't have the nerve to blow his nose

741
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:19,423
with all the heat around here.

742
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:22,377
Call it a hunch, man, but if it ain't Tony, who is it?

743
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:24,740
Some psychotic maniac hanging up in the rafters?

744
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:31,865
Call Wilshire Station.

745
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:34,264
Tell him we need a bag and a--

746
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:35,723
and a shuttle to the morgue.

747
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:42,397
Mike.

748
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:43,996
Where am I going?

749
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,247
Yeah.

750
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:47,402
To see if Tony's prowling around in the rafters.

00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,462
It's OK.

Ah, don't mind Mike.

00:49:28,613 --> 00:49:31,151
Hell, he's by the book.

760
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:32,715
He'd haul in his own mother if she dropped

761
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,315

00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:48,078
What?

766
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:52,249
I need you to tell me exactly what happened last night.

767
00:49:52,353 --> 00:49:54,681
Can you do that for me?

768
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,419
Yeah, I'll try.

769
00:49:56,523 --> 00:49:57,359
Good.

You have the right to an attorney.

773
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:31,593
Give up the right to remain silent, anything you say--

774
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:34,304
Oh, cut the fucking speech, man.

775
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:36,494
Don't you have better things to do than to be

776
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,093

777
00:50:38,198 --> 00:50:40,144
You better hope that's all they have to hang you for.

778
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:44,280
Well, I saw somebody run across the stage.

779
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:47,999
Um, I think it was Tony.

780
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:54,567
JACK: Kaycha, it's very important.

781
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:58,114
Now, could it have been anybody else?

782
00:50:58,218 --> 00:50:59,747
I don't know.

00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:03,639
No.

No.

00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:10,938
JACK: I'm sorry I gotta put you through this.

786
00:51:14,311 --> 00:51:15,144
It could have been me.

787
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:17,472
I-- I could be dead.

788
00:51:20,149 --> 00:51:20,983
Let's go.

789
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:27,970
I'll be right back.

790
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:39,508
What's up?

791
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:41,350
What the hell's the matter with you, Jack?

792
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:42,636
We've got a corpse in the morgue,

793
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,061
a dead body in the other room, and you--

794
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,904
And a killer in custody, smoking Tootsie Rolls.

795
00:51:46,008 --> 00:51:49,692
Listen, Mike, the girl is upset.

796
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:50,839
And she's a witness.

797
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:51,812
There's nothing wrong--

798
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:53,203
Did she see anything?

799
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:54,072
Maybe.

800
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:55,426
I'm working on it.

801
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:57,408
I see that.

802
00:51:57,512 --> 00:52:01,614
Look, Jack, I know you like her.

803
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,889
But please, as a favor to me, let it go until this is over.

804
00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:11,693
All right.

805
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,119
I'll take the girl home, then I'll meet you downtown.

806
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:16,107
Let's see if we can't stimulate Tony's memory.

807
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:19,827
The operative term here is interrogate.

808
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:22,260
Look, I can handle Tony.

809
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:26,188
Why don't you come back and see what Joe knows about him.

810
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,821
Great.

811
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,662
That'll give me an opportunity to teach the resident slimeball

812
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:31,088
a little lesson in etiquette.

813
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:34,667
Remember the idea is to get information from him.

814
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:39,324
Still, one quick lesson wouldn't hurt.

815
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:48,745
Easy, Jim.

816
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:51,316
Anything you get that way will be thrown out in court.

817
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,533
You listen to the man.

818
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,374
You're retaliating an innocent man.

819
00:52:54,479 --> 00:52:55,904
You get up.

820
00:52:56,008 --> 00:52:58,059
I want answers, and I want alibis, and I want them now.

821
00:52:58,164 --> 00:53:00,839
I told you I didn't do nothing!

822
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,065
When did you clip the wires to the emergency exit?

823
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:05,602
Hey, man, I'm not the only one using that door.

824
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:10,190
And mostly girls use that exit on their way home, all right?

825
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:11,753
Hey, we can't have that thing going off.

826
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:13,526
You're wasting our time, Tony.

827
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,577
And besides, we know you got priors.

828
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:17,522
Pimping, drugs, theft.

829
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,504
Hey, refresh his memory.

Can't we get a shrink to-- to declare psychotic dementia?

I can't hold him any longer.

And if I take this in front of a judge with what we've got now,

865
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:47,116
he's going to think I'm crazy.

866
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:51,045
Just let him go.

867
00:55:56,154 --> 00:55:58,970
What is it they want, Jack?

868
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:02,132

You can't be serious.

Well, you didn't think he was a vegetarian, did you?

885

I can't watch this.

886
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:50,375
You might have to dance with your partner,

887

Absolutely.

It's funny, really.

892
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:26,766
You know, if they would just lay still,

893
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,032
the snake would ignore them.

894
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:32,396
They run around like maniacs and snap.

That's what kills them.

00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:21,949
'cause I found another lover when your heart wasn't free.

921
00:59:22,054 --> 00:59:26,120
Babe, I found another lover.

922
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:30,256
Someone to take your place.

923
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:34,878
Babe, I found another lover.

924
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:37,555
Someone to fill this space.

925
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,641
[applause]

926
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:43,777
I'm out of here, girl.

927
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:44,646
Oh, wait a sec.

928
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:45,827
Can you take me down to Pico?

929
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:47,287
My car's in the shop. - Oh, sure.

930
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:48,643
I'll meet you out back.

931
00:59:48,748 --> 00:59:49,998
But please hurry, because I'm already late.

932
00:59:50,103 --> 00:59:50,971
OK.

933
01:00:08,594 --> 01:00:09,288
Whoa!

934
01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:11,095
And she's off.

935
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,259
I thought we were gonna go out and find some trouble tonight.

936
01:00:14,363 --> 01:00:15,198
Oh, I'm sorry.

937
01:00:15,302 --> 01:00:16,483
I forgot.

938
01:00:16,588 --> 01:00:19,090
I promised my sister I'd babysit.

939
01:00:19,194 --> 01:00:22,601
I guess I'll just have to handle double the trouble,

940
01:00:22,705 --> 01:00:24,304
if I can find it.

941
01:00:24,408 --> 01:00:25,764
OK.

942
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:26,980
I'll see you.

943
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:34,799
Erica, I'm sorry.

944
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:35,773
Maybe tomorrow, OK?

945
01:00:35,877 --> 01:00:36,747
Get out of here.

946
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,096
[footsteps]

947
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:05,699
Hey, lady?

948
01:01:05,802 --> 01:01:08,062
Hey, uh, help a guy out?

949
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:09,105
- Yeah. - Than--

950
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:10,043
Yeah.

951
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:10,912
Thanks?

952
01:01:11,016 --> 01:01:13,311
Do you have any spare change?

953
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,736
Yeah.

954
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,412
Yeah.

955
01:01:17,517 --> 01:01:19,464
Here.

956
01:01:19,568 --> 01:01:22,556
[whimpering]

957
01:01:36,494 --> 01:01:40,074
[honking]

958
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,878
All right, Candi, I'm coming.

959
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:48,971
[honking continues]

960
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:52,100
Candi, stop it.

961
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:54,741
[honking continues]

962
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:57,244
Candi, that's not funny.

963
01:02:01,136 --> 01:02:02,005
Candi?

964
01:02:14,345 --> 01:02:19,245
Oh, thank God it's you.

965
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:22,303
[screaming]

966
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:32,904
Hi.

967
01:02:33,008 --> 01:02:33,842
Hi.

968
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,986
You're finally waking up.

969
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:41,385
[yawns] Yeah.

970
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:45,521
I haven't slept like this since, uh--

971
01:02:45,626 --> 01:02:46,911
mm.

972
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:51,395
Hey, what time is it, anyway?

973
01:02:51,499 --> 01:02:53,862
Mm.

974
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:55,183
Almost 9:00.

975
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:56,990
Damn, I gotta get going.

976
01:02:57,096 --> 01:02:58,347
What? Hey!

977
01:02:58,451 --> 01:02:59,736
I gotta get going.

978
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,309
You can't go.

979
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:03,664
I started breakfast already.

980
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:05,924
Hey, I really shouldn't be here.

981
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:08,078
You know what kind of trouble I could get in being here?

982
01:03:08,182 --> 01:03:11,137
What?

983
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:12,770
[giggling]

984
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:29,002
You do backstage. I'll get the dressing rooms.

985
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:29,975
Right.

986
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:46,346
[sniffs]

987
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:14,707
That's all the warning you get, Tony.

988
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:16,168
[clicking]

989
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:26,491
What in the-- oh, my God.

990
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:27,464
No.

991
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:33,615
Kaycha.

992
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,018
Jack, you OK?

993
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:29,503
[yelling]

994
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:42,435
[chatter]

995
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:46,987
He just came out of nowhere.

996
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:48,100
Police.

997
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:49,351
Just stay in your car.

998
01:05:54,391 --> 01:05:55,294
Is he dead?

999
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:57,345
Oh, my God.

1000
01:05:57,448 --> 01:05:58,353
Damn it.

1001
01:06:08,536 --> 01:06:12,847
Well, I never thought I'd be congratulating you

1002
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,966
on filling another body bag.

1003
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,226
But congratulations.

1004
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:19,068
Looks like you've, uh, cracked a tough one.

1005
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:27,062
Are you going to sit down or stop pacing or something?

1006
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:31,233
Who are you trying to bullshit, me or yourself?

1007
01:06:31,338 --> 01:06:33,909
What's the matter with you?

1008
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:35,612
Has, uh, cracking this case put a crimp

1009
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:37,558
in your collecting body?

1010
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:38,983
You let him go.

1011
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:40,304
No hard evidence.

1012
01:06:40,408 --> 01:06:42,876
Now we have a corpse and no hard evidence.

1013
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,171
What do you call a cubbyhole with a two-way mirror?

1014
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:46,768
And like you said, I record that's

1015
01:06:46,874 --> 01:06:49,132
going to make Butch Cassidy look like, what, a Boy Scout?

1016
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:50,279
Right.

1017
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,990
And like you said, no record of violence.

1018
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:54,312
OK, then why did he run?

1019
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:55,666
I mean, you don't run unless you've

1020
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:56,709
got something to hide, right?

1021
01:07:02,201 --> 01:07:05,537
Look, Jack's disappeared before.

1022
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:06,303
Wait.

1023
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:07,276
Wait a minute.

1024
01:07:07,379 --> 01:07:09,118
Who's talking about Jack?

1025
01:07:09,222 --> 01:07:12,593
Look, you know damn well what we're talking about.

1026
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:14,817
If you're working so hard to convict a dead man,

1027
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:17,563
I know you're working double time to try to find a live one.

1028
01:07:24,793 --> 01:07:25,627
OK.

1029
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:28,130
Where is he?

1030
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:30,876
What do you got?

1031
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,647
Well, nothing yet.

1032
01:07:32,753 --> 01:07:35,081
We're doing ballistics on the dead girls.

1033
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:37,723
I can let you know by late this afternoon, though.

1034
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:41,164
Mike.

1035
01:07:45,126 --> 01:07:47,628
He's not a killer.

1036
01:07:47,733 --> 01:07:50,479
Where is he?

1037
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,390
I don't know.

1038
01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:54,336
I don't even know where he's been the last few times

1039
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,483
I've seen him.

1040
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:06,919
[tires squealing]

1041
01:08:14,774 --> 01:08:15,642
Hey!

1042
01:08:15,747 --> 01:08:16,685
Where you going?

1043
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:21,239
Get-- get back here!

1044
01:08:21,342 --> 01:08:22,281
[knocking]

1045
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:23,290
Come in.

1046
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:30,692
Hey, um, have you seen Kathy?

1047
01:08:30,797 --> 01:08:33,368
Uh-uh.

1048
01:08:33,472 --> 01:08:34,411
Huh.

1049
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:35,698
That's funny.

1050
01:08:35,802 --> 01:08:38,026
She said she was gonna come in here and say hello.

1051
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,327
I haven't seen her.

1052
01:08:41,432 --> 01:08:43,101
Sorry, girlfriend.

1053
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,015
Besides ballistics don't lie.

1054
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:55,613
We've got the gun and we've got the bullets.

1055
01:08:55,717 --> 01:08:56,795
Circumstantial.

1056
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,393
Oh, come on.

1057
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:00,791
He's not the first cop to take the law into his own hands.

1058
01:09:00,896 --> 01:09:02,808
Look, I'm just not convinced it all points at him.

1059
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:04,059
Why?

1060
01:09:04,164 --> 01:09:05,102
We've got a morgue full of dead dancers

1061
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:06,596
and a fistful of his bullets.

1062
01:09:06,701 --> 01:09:08,612
You're fishing in a dry lake on this one, Mike.

1063
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:11,983
Yeah, well, someone's got to play devil's advocate.

1064
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:14,382
Just so long as you know it's the devil you're defending.

1065
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:24,531
I've been expecting you.

1066
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:26,755
You didn't think I'd be in jail by now?

1067
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:30,023
You're a cop, Jack.

1068
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:32,282
They'd never figure on a cop.

1069
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:34,644
Kaycha, I'm a detective.

1070
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,460
Apparently that's something you didn't figure on.

1071
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:40,797
They've got Tony, Jack.

1072
01:09:40,901 --> 01:09:42,118
They don't need us.

1073
01:09:46,046 --> 01:09:48,269
You just don't get it, do you?

1074
01:09:48,373 --> 01:09:49,104
What?

1075
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:50,494
We can go to the next town.

1076
01:09:50,599 --> 01:09:52,893
There's no challenge here anymore, anyway.

1077
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:55,082
There is no next town, Kaycha.

1078
01:09:55,187 --> 01:09:56,021
You're coming with me.

1079
01:09:59,635 --> 01:10:01,200
I'm sorry, Jack.

1080
01:10:01,304 --> 01:10:26,990
Yeah, so am I.

1081
01:10:27,094 --> 01:10:28,032
I'm sorry.

1082
01:10:31,925 --> 01:10:32,932
I'm sorry.

1083
01:10:35,956 --> 01:10:39,432
You'll get a lot of years to think about it.

1084
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,823
No.

1085
01:10:40,927 --> 01:10:41,830
Not me.

1086
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:46,591
You will.

1087
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,452
[screaming]

1088
01:11:05,151 --> 01:11:06,647
Jesus Christ.

1089
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,836
He killed her.

1090
01:11:08,941 --> 01:11:11,722
He killed her and he's trying to kill me.

1091
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:12,486
OK.

1092
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,667
It's all over now.

1093
01:11:13,772 --> 01:11:15,266
Just put the knife down.

1094
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,239
Back off.

1095
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:19,507
I knew it was him.

1096
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:21,835
I said back off!

1097
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,330
Everybody out of the door.

1098
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:24,268
Move!

1099
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:55,620
Watch out.

1100
01:12:03,718 --> 01:12:04,934
Well, he's still in town.

1101
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:06,776
Let's go.

1102
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,714
Where is he?

1103
01:12:07,819 --> 01:12:08,793

JACK: Kaycha.

1287
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:29,235
We have evidence.

1288
01:26:35,074 --> 01:26:36,325
Enough to prove you did it.

1289
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:41,956
But not enough to know why.

1290
01:26:42,061 --> 01:26:42,895
You have nothing.

1291
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:53,948
Jack, your partner shot you.

1292
01:26:54,052 --> 01:26:54,921
If you had evidence--

1293
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:56,241
Tell me why, then.

1294
01:26:56,345 --> 01:26:58,813
If I'm a dead man, tell me why.

1295
01:26:58,918 --> 01:27:00,308
I had to!

1296
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:10,247
Jack, you saw them.

1297
01:27:10,353 --> 01:27:11,360
They were scampering around.

1298
01:27:11,464 --> 01:27:12,403
They were plotting.

1299
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:14,454
JACK: Because you were the star.

1300
01:27:14,558 --> 01:27:17,442
Just being jealous of the star?

1301
01:27:17,547 --> 01:27:18,903
That's normal, Kaycha.

1302
01:27:19,007 --> 01:27:21,927
I knew it.

1303
01:27:22,031 --> 01:27:24,499
I-- I knew you'd take their side.

1304
01:27:24,603 --> 01:27:27,765
Why can't you all just leave me the fuck alone?

You OK?

Mike, you killed your partner.

Kaycha, look--

1346
01:34:17,827 --> 01:34:19,809
You can't kill us both.

1347
01:34:19,913 --> 01:34:22,660
Besides, just being here is as good as a confession.
