thing you've said.

183
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:44,886
Enough. You're both
giving me a headache.

184
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,639
Mr. Tyler here thinks he's
orking for <i>The Washington Post.</i>

185
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,766
Well, I'm sorry if I take
my job seriously.

186
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,310
I hope I haven't kept you
from getting a Pulitzer.

187
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:53,728
Are you always this assertive?

188
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:55,396
If it will get me the job.

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,815
Who are you anyway?

190
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:59,943
Mr. Tyler, meet Lisa Connors,

191
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,528
the newest member of
<i>The Daily Crusader </i> staff.

192
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,085
I look like at a total loser .

193
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,253
[Lisa] You look great.

194
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,796
You're just
lying to make me feel better.

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Like that. That's amazing.

196
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,800
[Shelby] You can wear it
if you want.

197
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:27,593
You serious?

198
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:29,220
Of course.
We're roommates now,

199
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,514
doubling our wardrobe
is twice the fun.

200
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,142
Cool. Thanks.

201
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:37,770
Okay, so what am I
supposed to say these girls?

202
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,272
Just be yourself.

203
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,357
Rush week is about everyone
getting to know each other.

204
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:45,193
Think about it like
you're interviewing them.

205
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,112
Right. Easy for you to say.

206
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:50,157
[sighs]

207
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,908
Who am I kidding?
I'm never gonna get in.

208
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:53,493
Yes, you will.

209
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:55,745
But I have absolutely nothing
to say to them. Nothing.

210
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,748
Okay, I'm gonna let you in
on a Connors family secret.

211
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,710
Anytime that you feel like you
don't know what to say to
someone,

212
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,210
just complement them on
what they're wearing

213
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,713
and ask them where
they bought it.

214
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:07,756
Okay. And that's really
going to work?

215
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,967
According to my mom, it never
fails.

216
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:11,552
Okay, come on.

217
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,888
We have Kappa Gams as seven,

218
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,097
Alpha Tau at eight.

219
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,807
And tomorrow...

220
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:20,269
[classical music playing]

221
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,943
The Kappas pride ourselves

222
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:31,487
on a commitment to leadership
and community service.

223
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,365
We constantly ask ourselves
"Can we do more?"

224
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,783
[bell rings]

225
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,953
Hi, I'm Victoria.

226
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:40,955
Let me tell you little bit about
ourselves.

227
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,498
The Kappas pride ourselves

228
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,666
on a commitment to leadership
and community service.

229
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,503
We constantly ask ourselves,
"Can we do more?"

230
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:49,755
[bell tinkles]

231
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:51,173
I think you will really
fit in here.

232
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,591
What did you say your major was?

233
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:53,842
Journalism.

234
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,344
That is so cool.

235
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,095
Maybe you'll be one of those
anchors on the evening news.

236
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:03,435
This one was your mom's
sorority, right?

237
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,937
Yep, I say we give it
15 minutes

238
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,188
and then we leave.

239
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,815
I can't believe how boring
these things are.

240
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,025
[Shelby] Yeah, I know. I never
thought I'd get this sick

241
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,818
of talking about myself.

242
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:15,446
-Hi. Come on in.
-Hi.

243
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,284
Hi. I'm Kim Lessing.

244
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,370
-Hi.
-Welcome to Pi Gamma Beta.

245
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:23,913
This is Drea Davenport.

246
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:25,623
She was the pledge last year.

247
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,165
we've met. Haven't we?

248
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, not officially.

249
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:31,002
I'm Lisa Connors, and this is...

250
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,462
[Kim] You're Lisa.

251
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,089
We were wondering
when you would show up.

252
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:37,050
Your mother called, and said you
be coming by.

253
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:41,304
Oh, that was nice
of her.

254
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:42,722
Look, you might as well get this
over with,

255
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,349
you know you're not
getting out of here

256
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:46,642
without seeing all of the
pictures of her when she was
here,

257
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:47,685
and her old room

258
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:50,062
and anything else
we can dig out.

259
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:52,439
Yeah, I was afraid of this.

260
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,899
Come on, I'll try to make this

261
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,526
as painless as possible.

262
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,534
Hi.

263
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,334
That's a beautiful jacket you're
wearing.

264
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:14,669
Where did you get it?

265
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:15,920
Do you like it?

266
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:19,549
There's this wonderful vintage
store downtown.

267
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,010
Have you met Paige Tashman?

268
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,178
She's rushing this year too.

269
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,098
-Paige, this is...
-Shelby. Hi.

270
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,140
Nice to meet you.

271
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:30,183
That's not my mom, is it?

272
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,602
No. Take a closer look.

273
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:35,647
That's not you?

274
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,274
[chuckles] Pretty amazing,huh?

275
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:40,402
-Yeah, you really changed.
-In just a year.

276
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,362
It never would've happened
without the house.

277
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,823
How do you mean?

278
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,742
The sisters really support
each other.

279
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,535
It's like no matter
what happens,

280
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:50,870
there's always
someone there for you.

281
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,788
Like family.

282
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,374
Right.

283
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,917
I'm serious.

284
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,879
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean
to be rude.

285
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,339
It's just...

286
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:07,345
Well... see my dad left
when I was four,

287
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,679
and my mom was
always working,

288
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:12,307
So, I don't exactly count on
family to be there.

289
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,725
I'll tell you what,

290
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,393
whether you decide to
pledge or not,

291
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,772
I hope you feel free to come
here whenever you want.

292
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,690
Consider the Pi Gamms
your family.

293
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,650
Thanks.

294
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:25,862
And speaking of family...

295
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,031
your mother, the flower child.

296
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,574
[both laugh]

297
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:32,242
She always tells me
I don't know how to dress.

298
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:35,037
Come on.

299
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,716
[burps]

300
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,094
Ooh, that's attractive.

301
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,594
Didn't know I had an audience.

302
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:53,471
A little too much partying?

303
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:54,680
It's rush week.

304
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:57,100
Don't tell me you're
going Greek.

305
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:58,393
Maybe.

306
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:00,937
And here I thought you might
actually be smart.

307
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,023
Sorry to disappoint you.

308
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,734
You know, one of the pledges
disappeared last year

309
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:07,860
they were hazing her.

310
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:08,694
How do you know that?

311
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:09,904
I just do.

312
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,239
Everybody tried to deny
that it happened,

313
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:13,698
but I'm positive that's
what it was.

314
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:16,159
And she just disappeared
into thin air?

315
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,746
I'm sure it was the
administration,

316
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,998
because they're
afraid of bad press.

317
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,459
What are you doing?

318
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,922
I'm following you?

319
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,133
Why?

320
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:36,720
Well, Carl Bernstein is
giving a lecture on Thursday

321
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,222
and I got two tickets,

322
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:41,225
so I thought maybe
you'd want to go.

323
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:44,395
With you?

324
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:48,399
Well, that was the idea.

325
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,775
[chuckles]

326
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,318
Okay.

327
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:52,486
Really?

328
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,654
-Yeah
-Okay.

329
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:58,700
Great. Well, I-I-I...
Yeah. I'll catch you later

330
00:16:58,743 --> 00:16:59,909
at The Daily Crusader tomorrow.

331
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:00,952
Yeah.

332
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:08,543
Whoops.

333
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:10,920
[chuckles]

334
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:20,471
[bell tolls]

335
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:30,856
Lisa. It snowed here.

336
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,316
You think were going
the right way?

337
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,651
Yeah, there it is.

338
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:37,069
I see the bonfire.

339
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,784
[kids cheering]

340
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:46,954
[Terry] Out of my way.

341
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:49,582
Go, Terry.

342
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,959
[grunting]

343
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,717
Hey you guys finally
showed up.

344
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,636
Yeah, we got a little
lost, though.

345
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:03,970
[Drea laughs]

346
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:05,639
You two have to catch up.

347
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,390
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

348
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,100
Come on Terry's kicking
everybody's butts.

349
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:12,979
Whoo!

350
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,398
Did she win again.

351
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,193
I think the guys are
all afraid of her now.

352
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:20,027
[laughs]

353
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,237
Glad you two could make it.

354
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,572
We're excited to be here.
Thanks.

355
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:25,616
Now you're going to see
what being a Pi Gamm

356
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,659
is really about.

357
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,077
This is all the fun stuff.

358
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,288
Go Terry.

359
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,958
[loud cheering]

360
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,255
Way to go, Terry.

361
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,218
Who's next?

362
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:50,223
-You.
-Me?

363
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,058
Oh, no thanks.

364
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,602
Afraid to get your pretty
clothes all dirty?

365
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:55,520
[Drea] Leave her alone, Terry.

366
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:56,813
She's just a freshman.

367
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:58,939
She is a legacy, like I was.

368
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:00,732
She can do it.

369
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:04,111
You don't want everyone to think
you're chicken, do you?

370
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,779
Yeah, come on Lisa. Do it.

371
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:07,739
Okay.

372
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:09,700
-[applause]
-All right.

373
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:12,786
[laughs]

374
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,749
[Drea] Go for it, Lisa.

375
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,542
Okay, I'll probably lose.

376
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,043
I have total faith in you.

377
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:23,963
Rules are simple.

378
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,507
First one to the top,
drink the shot

379
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:27,925
and get back down, wins.

380
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,678
Anything goes.

381
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:36,642
Okay, three, two, one, go.

382
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:42,355
[cheering]

383
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:45,150
[grunting]

384
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,909
[Terry] Bitch.

385
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:03,751
-[cheering continues]
-[Terry grunts]

386
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,180
-Whoo
-[giggles]

387
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:25,772
Come on.

388
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,565
Back off!

389
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,404
[Lisa grunts]

390
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:10,022
[indistinct chatter]

391
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:35,714
As you all know,

392
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:39,884
the rush period is
coming to an end shortly.

393
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,344
You'll be getting your bids

394
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:44,763
and you'll be deciding whether
or not you want to pledge.

395
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:47,975
Now this is
a very exciting time,

396
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:51,562
but only if you're responsible
for your own actions.

397
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:53,272
And by responsibility, I mean,

398
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:56,400
don't let things get
out of hand.

399
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,569
As Dean of students
here, I...

400
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:01,029
Well, it's my responsibility
that you get

401
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:04,365
all the benefit out of
Anders College that you can,

402
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:06,075
but you do it safely.

403
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,035
So, remember, my door
is always open

404
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,746
if you want to come talk.

405
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,497
All right? Anytime.

406
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,749
Thank you, Dean Curtis..

407
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:14,792
There are refreshments
in the other room.

408
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,046
Same crap every year.

409
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,515
Shelby?

410
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,728
What's wrong?

411
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,398
I just want to go home.

412
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,776
Everybody hates me.

413
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,028
No, nobody hates you.

414
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,155
Yes they do.

415
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,989
They think I'm stupid and ugly.

416
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,450
Hey. Don't say that.

417
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,329
What if I don't make it in?

418
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,372
What if you get a bid and I
don't?

419
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,417
You'll get a bid. We both will.

420
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,380
Look, I won't pledge if they
don't take us both.

421
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,758
Okay?

422
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,592
Really?

423
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,553
Promise.

424
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,263
We're a team, remember?

425
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,269
Thanks. You're the greatest.

426
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:23,274
Hey, did you notice
how Bernstein

427
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,276
doesn't even mention Woodward
anymore?

428
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,820
I know. When he was talking
about Watergate,

429
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:29,404
it was like it was
from a movie or something.

430
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:31,698
Yeah, it's all those things.

431
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:34,952
-Hey, you want to get
some ice cream?
-Sure.

432
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,538
Like I was saying, Watergate,
Vietnam War,

433
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,122
Kennedy getting shot...

434
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:42,334
Everything happened before
we were even born.

435
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:43,794
I know.

436
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,923
You know what the problem is
though?

437
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:53,052
Is that we don't have
Burns called "moral leadership."

438
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,220
Who's Burns?

439
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:58,516
James McGregor Burns?

440
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,935
He wrote that book called <i>Leadership </i> back in the 70s.

441
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:03,521
-No.
-It won the Pulitzer.

442
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:06,023
Like I know every book
that won the Pulitzer.

443
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,400
Do you read all the time?

444
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,733
What, they don't allow you
to read

445
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,110
in your little sorority?

446
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:13,196
I'm not in a sorority yet.

447
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,741
Hi, can I taste
the Chocolate Ritz, please?

448
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:22,998
What?

449
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,292
-Nothing.
-You were staring.

450
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:28,086
No, no...you look great..

451
00:24:29,547 --> 00:24:31,046
Thanks.

452
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,133
Thank you.

453
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:38,387
Mmm. It's really good.
You want to taste?

454
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:44,935
Tastes good.

455
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:50,523
Um...we'll take two.

456
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:54,611
[chuckles]

457
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:13,337
[Steven] Hey.

458
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,880
Hi.

459
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:17,215
Are you back here
hiding from the world?

460
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,927
Yeah, I was kind of tired.

461
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,094
What you reading?

462
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,056
Nothing?

463
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,729
I thought it wouldn't hurt
to take a look.

464
00:25:34,651 --> 00:25:37,276
-Steven, it's the library.
-[Steven] So?

465
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:43,491
See, you thought reading
was boring.

466
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,766
How can you be so calm?

467
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,935
What are you talking about?

468
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,103
They're voting tonight.

469
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:15,938
You act like you're
not even nervous.

470
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,732
There's not much more
we can do at this point.

471
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:22,111
[scoffs]

472
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:23,570
God I hate sitting in some
stupid class

473
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,156
when there's really
important stuff going on.

474
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:38,710
Okay.

475
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:41,462
Next is Paige Tashman.

476
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,924
She's too...fat.

477
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:48,386
Shannon only wants anorexics
in the house.

478
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,681
We do have a reputation
to maintain.

479
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:54,391
Keep in mind, her dad owns that
house at Lake Hope.

480
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:56,393
We could use it for weekenders.

481
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:57,686
Okay. Vote.

482
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,229
Three reds and she's history.

483
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,610
Ooh!

484
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,070
Hah. Barely.

485
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:09,906
Okay, next.

486
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,367
The queen of the wannabes.

487
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,036
This is Shelby Blake.

488
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:24,754
-Anybody home?
-Oh, come in.

489
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,005
You got a sec?

490
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,339
For you? Anytime.

491
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:35,222
You may not think so
after we're through.

492
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:38,725
I didn't get in, did I?

493
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,393
I'm really sorry, Lisa.

494
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:42,353
Why?

495
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:44,564
Some people just thought you
didn't want it bad enough.

496
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:47,317
But I-I do want it.

497
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,028
You guys have become my best
friends.

498
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:53,782
I don't know anyone
else here.

499
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:55,784
It's a little late now.

500
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,411
What if I talk to them?

501
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:03,082
-The ones who didn't want me...
-Lisa--

502
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,875
Surprise!

503
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:07,169
That was priceless.

Oh my God, I could not kept
a straight face much longer.

506

What's going on?

507
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:15,135
You're in. We both are.

508
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,470
-What?
-Yes.

509
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:19,055
Lisa. It was a joke.

510
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,224
You should've seen the look
on your face.

511
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,642
I thought you were gonna
start begging me.

512
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,227
See, it all worked out,
just like you said it would.

The Rose is the symbol
of our unity.

521
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:20,238
It represents our
commitment to sisterhood.

522
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:22,448
By giving the very source
of our lives to the rose,

523
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:24,450
we also give it our strength.

524

you give up yourself...

you're asked a direct question.

00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:14,764
Paige you missed a spot.

543
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,560
Remember, one of you girls is
going to win sisterhood award

544
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:21,020
at the end of the week.

545
00:31:21,064 --> 00:31:23,189
To win that honor, you have to
demonstrate three things:

546
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:26,066
Unity, trust, and commitment.

547
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,068
Working together
is the first step.

548
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:29,111
So when you're done in here,

549
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,446
you can start in
on the bathrooms.

550
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:33,573
[girls laugh]

551
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,209
This floor is a mess.

552
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:46,711
[girls laugh]

553
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,632
Come on. Get busy.

554
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,217
We have to get the bathrooms
done by 8:00.

555
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,361
[Kim] This is it.

556
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:16,114
The statue's in the Dean's
backyard.

557
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,866
Are you sure we can lift it?

558
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:19,242
Kyle's did it a few years ago.

559
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,411
Of course, most of them got
expelled.

560
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,496
Who's gonna climb over
and unlock the gate?

561
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,332
Lisa?

562
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,916
I will. I'll do it.

563
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,210
You're going to get us
busted before we even start.

564
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:31,420
You sure?

565
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:32,796
Yeah, definitely.

566
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:42,181
[Shelby] Oh! Okay.

567
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:54,734
[Paige] Are you sure
she can get out?

568
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:55,902
Shhh.

569
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,493
[sighs] So we could get kicked
out of school for this?

570
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:05,787
That's what
makes it exciting.

571
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:10,123
-[dog barking]
-[Shelby screams]

572
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,084
Shelby, come on.

573
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:13,710
Shelby.

574
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,635
Come on. Hurry.

575
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,388
You're going to
get us busted.

576
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:28,140
Come on.

577
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,228
Grab a leg. Hurry.

578
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,356
-[girls clamoring]
-[dog barking]

579
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,732
Come on, come on.

580
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:38,609
Hurry up.

581
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,444
-[Shelby] Grab my hand.
-Come on.

582
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:42,154
-Help her.
-Hurry.

583
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:43,864
Here she comes.

584
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:45,491
She's stuck.

585
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:47,076
It's happening again.

586
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,119
Shhh.

587
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:51,830
[Dean Curtis] Virgo, stop that!

588
00:33:51,873 --> 00:33:55,333
-[Curtis] Right now!
-Hurry up.

589
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:57,293
Virgo!

590
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:05,969
[windhield wipers moving]

591
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,856
[rain pouring]

592
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:33,953
[Lisa gasps] Hey.

593
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:35,872
Come on you guys,
this isn't funny.

594
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:49,844
The second part of your
training involves trust.

595
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:53,305
Part of being in Pi Gamma Beta
is knowing that...

596
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,142
no matter what...

597
00:34:57,186 --> 00:35:00,812
you must always have faith
in your sisters.

598
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,111
[glass shatters]

599
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:14,783
Open your mouths.

600
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:20,456
Commitment.

601
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:32,009
Unity.

602
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:33,259
Trust.

603
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:38,765
Go ahead.

604
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:42,644
[coughs]

605
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:53,278
You know, Shelby...

606
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:56,532
last year I won
the sisterhood award.

607
00:35:56,575 --> 00:35:58,617
Maybe this year you'll
be voted best pledge

608
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,203
you'd like that
wouldn't you?

609
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:03,539
To be the best.

610
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,543
[crunches]

611
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:11,755
Excellent.

612
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:21,055
Don't you trust me, Lisa?

613
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:29,397
Very good.

614
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:32,483
I knew you wouldn't
let me down.

615
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,910
[kids chattering]

616
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:46,121
[sighs] I'll level with you,
Miss Connors,

617
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,873
this is disappointing work.

618
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,001
I'll rewrite them.

619
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,461
What's the point? It's old news.

620
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,962
We may only be a college paper,

621
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:58,465
but I expect 100% from the
people on staff at all times.

622
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,676
That's what I'm giving.

623
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,804
All I know is your first
articles were excellent.

624
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,431
Now I'm getting this.

625
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,309
Things have just been a little
crazy the past couple of weeks.

626
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:13,772
Well, maybe take a little rest
from <i>The Daily Crusader.</i>

627
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,773
It's been a lot put on you
right from the start of school.

628
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,900
I can handle it. I'll just
write another article.

629
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,528
I didn't bring you in here to
argue the point, Lisa.

630
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,530
You come back and see me
next semester,

631
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,240
we'll take another
shot at it.

632
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,575
Okay?

633
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,665
Hey!

634
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,542
What's going on?

635
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,211
Lisa, what the hell's
gotten into you?

636
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,212
I can't talk right now.

637
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,297
You can never talk.

638
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,632
course you can't talk.

639
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:43,216
I've been trying to call you
for the past two days,

640
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,092
but you're never there.

641
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,385
This isn't a good time, Steven.

642
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,970
Listen Lisa, if you don't
want to go out with me

643
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,263
please just say so..

644
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,765
I told you this was going
to be a crazy week.

645
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:51,099
Oh that's right.
How could I forget?

646
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,560
It's slave and master week
over on Greek Row.

647
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,146
-You don't understand.
-No, I don't.

648
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,606
I thought we had something
kind of nice starting.

649
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,775
What? I just get cut off now?
Is that how it works?

650
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:13,037
-Hi, it's me.
-Lisa, hey.

651
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,288
I was beginning to think
you'd fallen

652
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:15,539
off the face of the earth.

653
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,874
Not yet, but I'm close.

654
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:18,249
Everything okay?

655
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:20,460
Everything pretty much
sucks right now.

656
00:38:20,504 --> 00:38:22,462
Oh, Hell Week, huh?

657
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,713
[chuckles]

658
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:24,714
Well, don't worry.

659
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:25,840
It'll be over before
you know it.

660
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:28,093
-Right.
<i>-Oh, come on,</i>

661
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:29,511
<i>don't be so negative.</i>

662
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,638
Listen, I've told
everybody in the office

663
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,306
how excited I am
about you getting in.

664
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,850
You want to trade places?

665
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:37,352
Lisa, why don't you just
stick it out.

666
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:38,436
You'll be glad you did.

667
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,436
Really.

668
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:42,523
Mom, I gotta go.

669
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:48,112
[girls chatter]

670
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:57,329
[whistle blows]

671
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:01,749
You were hard to track down.

672
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:04,168
What, they finally let you
out of your cage?

673
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:05,670
Not really.

674
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:07,547
I'm hiding out
for a few hours.

675
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:10,925
[whistle blows]

676
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:15,930
Steven, I acted like a jerk
the other day.

677
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:17,306
I'm really sorry.

678
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,933
It doesn't matter.

679
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:22,060
I had no idea how time-consuming
pledging would be.

680
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:24,396
No, don't use
that as an excuse.

681
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,689
You decide who you want to see

682
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:26,690
and what you want to do.

683
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,108
Not some girls' club.

684
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:30,193
-It's not that easy.
-So drop it.

685
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,320
I can't.

686
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:34,030
It's really important
to my mother.

687
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:37,242
If that's the only thing
that she considers important

688
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,494
then you two have some issues
to work out.

689
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:42,413
You're just so sure you're right
all the time. Aren't you?

690
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:43,581
[whistle blows]

691
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,875
You have this little
black and white theory

692
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,042
about everything,

693
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:49,211
and to hell with what
everyone else thinks.

694
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,635
I didn't come here to find
you to get preached at.

695
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,180
I came here because
I needed a friend.

696
00:40:05,812 --> 00:40:07,937
[cheering]

697
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,655
[girls hooting]

698
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:19,532
Paige, be sexy.

699
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,328
-Let's go. Walk.
-Sexy, Paige,

700
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:27,456
you can't bag a guy if you're
walking like a chicken.

701
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,333
You call that sexy?
Let's go, Paige.

[girls clamoring]

703
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,010
I had no idea you are so fat.

704
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:41,345
[laughs]

705
00:40:41,388 --> 00:40:43,137
Let's see you try
a little harder.

706
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:46,933
Come on back a little bit.
Let's go. Whoo!

707
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:48,643
No, no, no, no, no.

708
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:52,104
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
she needs a nickname.

709
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:54,148
How about "Saddlebags"?

710
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:58,319
How about "Baby Breasts"?

711
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,113
No, wait. You're baby breasts.

712
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:03,740
This is so humiliating.

713
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:05,367
It'll all be over
before we know it.

714
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,868
It'll be fine.

715
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:09,329
Yep. Let's mark her up, girls.

716
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:11,915
"Baby Breasts," that's your
new name, Paige.

718
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:15,293
Oh, little "Baby Breasts."

719
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:19,506
[all] Aw.

720
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,966
-Come on. Aw.
-Come on, Paige.

721
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:23,510
You're gonna have to try
a little harder than that.

722
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:24,635
That should knock her
out of the running

723
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,011
for the Sisterhood Award.

724
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,180
What's happening to you?

725
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,183
Next. Come on.

726
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:32,101
Let's go Shelby.

727
00:41:32,144 --> 00:41:33,477
Let's see if you can cut it.

728
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,733
[girls hooting, shouting]

729
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:48,199
Are you okay?

730
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,494
[sobs]

731
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,204
I can't do this anymore.

732
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,789
Then don't.

733
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,708
You don't have to do
anything you don't want.

734
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:58,084
Lisa...

735
00:41:58,128 --> 00:41:59,878
Go join the pledges.

736
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:01,629
-I was just...
-I'll take care of this.

737
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,478
Right here...

738
00:42:18,522 --> 00:42:20,355
[girls chattering]

739
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:24,526
Ah, Lisa...

740
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,611
you're next.

741
00:42:25,654 --> 00:42:26,819
You're next.

742
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:33,200
[overlapping speech]

743
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:38,122
We lost her.

744
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,624
Okay, walk...

745
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:43,961
She could be called
"Thunder Thighs".

746
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:50,175
Silence!

747
00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:54,304
I can see a few more areas of
improvement.

748
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:56,848
You remember, now,
cellulite is our enemy.

749
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:59,476
-[sobs]
-You can step down now.

750
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,978
[sobs]

751
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,814
You're through.

752
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:06,983
[sobs]

753
00:43:07,027 --> 00:43:14,156
Now all you have to do,

754
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:17,785
[girls laugh]

755
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,579
Now, all you have to do,
is just hang it.

756
00:43:20,623 --> 00:43:21,872
out there.

757
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,624
[Kim] They'll be able
to see it for miles.

758
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,334
[laughs]

759
00:43:29,881 --> 00:43:31,506
I can't, I can't...

760
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:32,715
It's too high.

761
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,467
Don't be such a baby.

762
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,761
You want to win
the Sisterhood Award.

763
00:43:36,805 --> 00:43:38,137
Don't you, Shelby?

764
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:47,939
[Drea] You have to get over
your fears.

765
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:49,940
Trust us, Shelby.

766
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:51,233
We're your sisters.

767
00:43:58,826 --> 00:44:01,576
[girls chattering]

768
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:10,626
Hey!

769
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,087
You didn't take your turn
on the table.

770
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:14,171
I decided to skip it.

771
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:16,132
-Who said you could do that?
-I did.

772
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:17,258
Where's Shelby?

773
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,759
You better watch your mouth.

774
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:20,886
You're not supposed to talk
unless I give you permission.

775
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:22,972
Hey!

776
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:26,308
Where's Shelby?

777
00:44:26,352 --> 00:44:27,226
I haven't seen her.

778
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,686
Come on. We're planting flags.

779
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:32,605
[high pitched scream]

780
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:40,071
[crowd shouts]

781
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:45,118
[girl screams]

782
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:53,417
[sobs] Shelby!

783
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:57,796
[sobbing]

784
00:45:11,937 --> 00:45:14,395
[indistinct chatter]

785
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:24,197
-Sergeant Sands.
-Curtis.

786
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,616
Sorry to get you up
in the middle of the night.

787
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:30,953
[crowd chatter]

788
00:45:43,342 --> 00:45:44,966
What happened?

789
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,218
I don't know.

790
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:48,470
She was drinking all those
shots.

791
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:49,554
Then she just ran off.

792
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:52,599
Did you see her?

793
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:54,141
No.

794
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,727
She wanted to be the best.

795
00:45:56,771 --> 00:45:59,855
She said she was going to
surprise us.

796
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:01,273
She must have been trying
to hang the banner

797
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:02,399
when she fell.

798
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:21,251
[Steven] Hey!

799
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,712
Nobody's seen you
for a couple of hours.

800
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:27,966
I was getting worried.

801
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:32,637
You okay?

802
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:38,267
I just keep seeing her lying
there on the ground.

803
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:42,271
All broken, and...

804
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:44,982
I try to bring up
some other image, but I can't.

805
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:50,070
What was going on?

806
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,118
It all happened so fast.

807
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:58,244
Was she alone?

808
00:46:58,288 --> 00:47:00,413
Maybe somebody
was with her on the tower.

809
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:01,747
I don't know.

810
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,583
I wasn't there. I don't know.

811
00:47:09,716 --> 00:47:11,507
I'm sorry.

812
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:20,807
For many of us, Shelby Blake

813
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:24,269
was still the little girl
we'd always known.

814
00:47:24,313 --> 00:47:27,814
We trust the Lord will
watch over her for us,

815
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:30,817
both as the child we remember

816
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:33,361
and as the young woman
she was becoming.

817
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:35,447
Amen.

818
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:50,377
[priest] I am so sorry.

819
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:52,379
If there's anything we can do to
help you,

820
00:47:52,423 --> 00:47:57,718
please let us know.

821
00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:58,885
Lisa?

822
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:01,804
Hi, Mr. Blake.

823
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:04,724
Hi.

824
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:06,601
I am so sorry.

825
00:48:08,063 --> 00:48:09,729
We want to thank you for coming.

826
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:10,939
You and the others...

827
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:13,524
Yeah.

828
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:15,818
I wish there was something
that I could have done.

829
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:17,320
We all do.

830
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:20,239
This just doesn't
make any sense.

831
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:21,740
I know.

832
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:23,825
I just can't imagine
what she was doing up there

833
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:24,910
in the first place.

834
00:48:27,915 --> 00:48:29,539
She was afraid of heights.

835
00:48:30,918 --> 00:48:33,085
She was?

836
00:48:33,128 --> 00:48:35,045
She wouldn't even climb a tree.

837
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:37,631
- Then--
- Lisa.

838
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:39,049
We should go if we want
to get back to campus

839
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:40,549
at a reasonable hour.

840
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:42,301
Okay, I'll be right there.

841
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:44,136
We want you to know,

842
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,554
we're really going
to miss Shelby.

843
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:47,265
She was so sweet.

844
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:49,600
Yeah. Sweet.

845
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:51,811
Sorry we have to go so soon.

846
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:53,396
It's a long way back.

847
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,944
That was so sad.

848
00:49:00,988 --> 00:49:03,446
I've never known
anyone who died.

849
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,614
It'll be up to us to make sure

850
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:06,783
the Pi Gamms are all dealing
with it okay.

851
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:08,451
especially the pledges.

852
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:11,246
Yeah, the important thing
now is the house.

853
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,372
Right.

854
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,165
We don't want this
to get out of hand.

855
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,628
Did you know Shelby was afraid
of heights?

856
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:22,047
No, I didn't.

857
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:25,509
Seems strange that she'd
on top of that building

858
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:27,177
all alone. Doesn't it?

859
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:29,638
Well, you never know
what people will do

860
00:49:29,682 --> 00:49:31,348
when people are drinking,
I guess.

861
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:33,100
Can we talk about something
else?

862
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,021
[sighs] Do you want
me to drive?

863
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:38,355
[sniffles]

864
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:39,565
I'm fine.

865
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:44,193
I'm sorry, but that's all
I can tell you at this point.

866
00:49:44,237 --> 00:49:47,530
Anders University does
everything in our power

867
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:49,240
to prevent accidents like that.

868
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,993
Sadly, we don't always succeed.

869
00:49:52,037 --> 00:49:55,079
Dean Curtis, is there any
possibility that this death

870
00:49:55,123 --> 00:49:57,540
is a result of hazing?

871
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,625
Hazing is strictly forbidden
by the University.

872
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:02,711
And I like to add
that our record

873
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,004
is spotless in this area.

874
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:05,505
Well maybe that's
because these incidents keep

875
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:07,591
getting swept under the carpet.

876
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:10,135
Are you referring to
something in particular?

877
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:12,637
Well, I'm referring to a pledge

878
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:14,306
that nearly died last year.

879
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,559
That doesn't sound familiar
to me.

880
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,936
You have a name?

881
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:26,025
No, I've just heard rumors
from several sources.

882
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:28,277
Rumors are different from facts.

883
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:29,445
Perhaps you should learn
the difference

884
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:31,072
before you start making
accusations.

885
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:35,201
[crowd clamoring]

886
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:38,954
<i>I shouldn't have</i>
<i>left her alone.</i>

887
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:41,415
Honey, you can't blame
yourself.

888
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:42,917
<i>It was an accident.</i>

889
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,876
But if I'd been there...

890
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,669
<i>You sure you don't</i>
<i>want to come home?</i>

891
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,380
[sighs]

892
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:49,589
I keep imagining that she's

893
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:52,175
going to walk through
the door any minute.

894
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,427
All happy and excited

895
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,680
and were going to talk about
what sort of day we had.

896
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:00,600
Maybe you should go spend
a couple of nights

897
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,018
at the sorority house.

898
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,812
<i>You shouldn't be alone.</i>

899
00:51:03,855 --> 00:51:04,686
[scoffs]

900
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,397
I'm fine alone. I'm used to it.

901
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,273
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

902
00:51:08,317 --> 00:51:10,359
Nothing.

903
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:11,652
All I'm suggesting is

904
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:14,113
that you spend a couple of
nights with friends.

905
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,282
I'll think about it.

906
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:19,701
<i>Lisa, I'm just trying to help.</i>

907
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,203
Okay I'll go.

908
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:23,080
Does that make you happy?

909
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:24,581
<i>Lisa...</i>

910
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:33,506
[Lisa] I didn't mean
to steal your bed.

911
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,841
Don't be silly.

912
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,676
I'll just go crash with Terry.

913
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,596
This must be really hard
for you.

914
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,433
You can stay here as long
as you like.

915
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,184
I feel like we're
real sisters.

916
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,769
Thanks.

917
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,283
Hi...is Lisa Connors here?

918
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,242
No.

919
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,536
Really? Well,
she left a message

920
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,621
telling me she would be here.

921
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,206
Look, she's really upset.
Okay?

922
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,417
Listen, could you just
tell her that I'm here

923
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,960
I'm sure she'd want to see me.

924
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,628
I already told you, she's upset.

925
00:52:14,672 --> 00:52:16,797
She doesn't want to see anybody.

926
00:52:21,846 --> 00:52:24,680
Lisa, it's really nice
to have you here.

927
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,348
Try and get some sleep. Okay?

928
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,741
[Drea] You doing okay?

929
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,619
It'll all be over soon.

930
00:52:49,622 --> 00:52:50,913
Just do what we said,

931
00:52:50,956 --> 00:52:52,789
and everything will be fine.

932
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:54,917
Why can't we just tell
the Dean what was going on?

933
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,836
Because we never tell
the secrets of the house.

934
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,546
Don't you remember
the vows you took?

935
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,381
But after all
that's happened...

936
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:02,883
Lisa...

937
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:05,928
you're part of the Pi Gamma Beta
family now.

938
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:07,763
You signed your oath in blood.

939
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,980
Lisa, could you come
with me now?

940
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:25,696
Were here for you.

941
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:29,824
It might be a good idea
if you go talk to

942
00:53:29,868 --> 00:53:31,868
one of the psychologists
on campus.

943
00:53:31,912 --> 00:53:33,995
Just so you have
somebody to talk to.

944
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:36,039
Maybe I will.

945
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,333
I keep thinking I should of
stayed with her,

946
00:53:38,377 --> 00:53:40,835
maybe she'd
still be alive.

947
00:53:40,879 --> 00:53:42,170
From what the others told me,

948
00:53:42,214 --> 00:53:44,881
your friend was very anxious
to prove she belonged.

949
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:46,967
Evidently she been drinking
a great deal.

950
00:53:49,012 --> 00:53:52,221
I don't really remember
her drinking anything.

951
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:55,224
-She was too nervous.
-Nervous?

952
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:59,979
Well... there was
a lot going on.

953
00:54:00,022 --> 00:54:01,939
What, at the sorority house?

954
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:03,983
Yeah.

955
00:54:04,026 --> 00:54:07,319
Lisa, we understand you've
been under a lot of pressure.

956
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:10,030
You're having a hard time
accepting your friend's death

957
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:11,406
you want to blame somebody

958
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,490
that's perfectly understandable.

959
00:54:12,534 --> 00:54:15,285
But why don't you
take a little time

960
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:16,995
and think about this?

961
00:54:19,165 --> 00:54:20,373
That's all?

962
00:54:21,418 --> 00:54:24,419
Well, for now.

963
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,462
I don't want to trouble
you anymore than I have to.

964
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:36,471
You don't want to know what
really happened, do you?

965
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,765
We do know.

966
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:46,481
Lame break.

967
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:47,733
Just shoot, okay?

968
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:49,818
I was just kidding.

969
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:51,570
I'm not in the mood for
your kidding tonight.

970
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:55,114
We should do something,

971
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,407
to keep up morale and all.

972
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:59,035
It doesn't really matter much
now, does it?

973
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:03,247
You know, Kim, we could really
use some leadership right now.

974
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:06,500
Well, maybe you should do it,
Drea.

975
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:08,753
Don't you even care
about what happened?

976
00:55:08,796 --> 00:55:10,880
Of course I care.

977
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:12,131
Just because I don't cry

978
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,923
and go on and on about it,
like some people,

979
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:15,300
doesn't mean I don't care.

980
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:16,885
We can all fall apart.

981
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:18,345
Someone's got to be strong.

982
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:20,221
Hey.

983
00:55:20,265 --> 00:55:21,723
Come on you guys.

984
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:23,975
We shouldn't fight.
Not now.

985
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:27,520
You're right.

986
00:55:27,564 --> 00:55:29,064
[Drea] Sorry.

987
00:55:29,107 --> 00:55:32,317
-This whole thing is just so...
-I know.

988
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:33,860
I know.

989
00:55:36,322 --> 00:55:37,613
Damn.

990
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:39,740
I win.

991
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:41,116
You beat Terry?

992
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,451
She got lucky.

993
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:44,912
Stupid eightball went
in the pocket too early.

994
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:47,206
You're up, Lisa.

995
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:50,209
Oh, um...

996
00:55:50,252 --> 00:55:51,919
Maybe you could take my turn.

997
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:53,796
Why don't we play teams?

998
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,171
Lisa and I will take
on you two.

999
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:58,591
Really I don't feel like it.

1000
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:02,178
Well... you're overruled.

1001
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:06,516
I think this will help us take
our mind off things for a while.

1002
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:07,975
Don't you?

1003
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:10,520
[sighs]

1004
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:15,233
I'll break.

1005
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:18,360
Steven you wrote this?

1006
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:21,196
They're hiding something.

1007
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,989
It's just like what happened
last year.

1008
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,367
Who is this girl you
keep talking about?

1009
00:56:25,411 --> 00:56:27,452
Are you sure you didn't
just make her up?

1010
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:29,788
You'll see what I mean
once I find her.

1011
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:31,832
You don't know these
girls, I do.

1012
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,875
They wouldn't do
something like this.

1013
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:36,044
Lisa, they were hazing you.

1014
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,920
That happens everywhere.

1015
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:40,047
That doesn't mean they killed,
for God sakes.

1016
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:42,758
You just can't keep throwing
these accusations around.

1017
00:56:42,802 --> 00:56:44,552
I mean, what if it
really was an accident?

1018
00:56:44,595 --> 00:56:46,887
And what if it wasn't?

1019
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:47,888
Don't you understand?
Your the key here.

1020
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:49,515
You should know more
than anyone.

1021
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:51,892
This could be a breakthrough
story.

1022
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:53,269
I don't care about a story.

1023
00:56:53,312 --> 00:56:54,520
Well you should, because
she was your best friend.

1024
00:56:54,564 --> 00:56:57,272
Who's going to find the truth
if you don't?

1025
00:56:57,315 --> 00:56:59,733
I'm so sick of everyone telling
me what I should do.

1026
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:01,109
It's your responsibility.

1027
00:57:01,153 --> 00:57:02,819
And I sure as hell don't
need any lectures

1028
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:04,279
on responsibility from you.

1029
00:57:11,204 --> 00:57:12,912
It's important at times
like this

1030
00:57:12,956 --> 00:57:14,038
for us to come together.

1031
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:16,583
Try and make some sense
out of something

1032
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:19,460
that seems so unfair...

1033
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:22,629
and to offer our love and
support to each other.

1034
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:27,885
[Steven] Hey.

1035
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:38,603
Our bond is what
keeps us strong.

1036
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:40,938
And our bond is made
sacred by our loyalty.

1037
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:45,651
And we must remember
our duty to the house

1038
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:49,322
and to the vows we took:

1039
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,866
-[men laugh]
-[Steven groans]

1040
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:55,411
Commitment...

1041
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,829
Unity...

1042
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:58,998
Trust.

1043
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:01,374
Commitment...

1044
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:03,960
Unity...

1045
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:06,004
Trust.

1046
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:08,298
-[Steven grunts]
-[men laugh]

1047
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,014
Committment, Unity, Trust.

1048
00:58:21,813 --> 00:58:23,187
[glass shattering]

1049
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:31,779
Here, fill this out.

1050
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:37,827
[Steven] Now you know it was
because of that editorial I
wrote.

1051
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,578
There was a copy stuck
to the car.

1052
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:41,830
Well, maybe they had
a right to be angry.

1053
00:58:41,873 --> 00:58:43,706
It was a pretty strongly worded
piece.

1054
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,292
What is it going to take...

1055
00:58:46,336 --> 00:58:47,961
for you guys to be convinced
that something wrong

1056
00:58:48,004 --> 00:58:49,045
is going on?

1057
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:52,423
[Lisa] Steven...

1058
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:54,342
They said at the paper
you were attacked.

1059
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:56,052
Are you okay?

1060
00:58:56,096 --> 00:58:57,846
I guess I must be,

1061
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:01,182
because the sergeant says
it might have been figment

1062
00:59:01,226 --> 00:59:02,140
of my imagination.

1063
00:59:02,184 --> 00:59:04,601
I never said that.
Come on in.

1064
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:10,190
Now you were there the night
of the accident,weren't you?

1065
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:13,735
Um...yeah,
she was my roommate.

1066
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:16,405
Maybe you can answer
a question for me?

1067
00:59:16,448 --> 00:59:19,908
Why were there colored
markings on your roommate's
body?

1068
00:59:22,912 --> 00:59:23,995
Markings?

1069
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:25,580
Most of them had been
rubbed off.

1070
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,457
Do you know anything
about that?

1071
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:30,626
No.

1072
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,922
You sure?

1073
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:37,967
It doesn't matter anyway,
right? I mean...

1074
00:59:38,011 --> 00:59:41,846
-She was drunk and she fell.
-[Sands] She wasn't drunk.

1075
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,722
What?

1076
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:46,433
The lab tests show that she
hadn't had a drink all night.

1077
00:59:54,276 --> 00:59:56,735
[Lisa] Paige.

1078
00:59:56,778 --> 00:59:58,737
-Yeah?
-You have a minute?

1079
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:03,782
-What for?
-Just... to talk.

1080
01:00:03,826 --> 01:00:06,660
But somewhere away from
here though.

1081
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:10,122
I can't.

1082
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,708
Paige, I need to know
what happened

1083
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:14,418
after I left that night.

1084
01:00:14,462 --> 01:00:16,211
Paige.

1085
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,339
I'm sorry, I can't.

1086
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,548
Were about to have
a quick meeting,

1087
01:00:19,592 --> 01:00:21,383
you two should be downstairs.

1088
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:29,682
Am I supposed to
just not talk to anyone?

1089
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,184
You're imagining things.

1090
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,727
That reporter boyfriend of yours

1091
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:33,895
is making you paranoid.

1092
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:35,480
You don't know
anything about him.

1093
01:00:35,523 --> 01:00:36,689
He's just using you.

1094
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,733
To try and dig up
dirt on the house.

1095
01:00:42,197 --> 01:00:44,197
-Lisa, we should go down.
-[Lisa] I'm not coming.

1096
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,867
-It's a required meeting.
-What's going on?

1097
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:52,037
Why don't you want me to
find out what happened that
night.

1098
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,497
Just do what I tell you,
okay?

1099
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,959
Remember, you're still
just a pledge.

1100
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:00,462
You know what? I'm tired
of being "just a pledge."

1101
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:02,255
I'm ready to be a human
being again.

1102
01:01:02,299 --> 01:01:04,341
Lisa, you walk away
like this. You're out.

1103
01:01:04,385 --> 01:01:05,467
Do you understand? Out.

1104
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,718
Is this what you meant by
family, Drea?

1105
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:22,149
-Hi.
-Hey.

1106
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:26,070
I didn't expect to see you here
tonight.

1107
01:01:26,114 --> 01:01:27,404
Disappointed?

1108
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:30,657
That's a dumb question.

1109
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:36,371
What's wrong?

1110
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:38,456
[sighs]

1111
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:44,045
I guess I just don't
know what to believe anymore.

1112
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:46,256
Look, if you're seeing
me just because of this story.

1113
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:47,589
You don't have to bother.

1114
01:01:47,633 --> 01:01:50,843
I'll still help you.

1115
01:01:52,972 --> 01:01:54,888
That doesn't sound like
you talking.

1116
01:01:57,018 --> 01:01:59,727
The Lisa I know is
much smarter than that.

1117
01:02:01,063 --> 01:02:03,355
Everything is just so
messed up right now.

1118
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:07,900
But you can't let them
get to you.

1119
01:02:07,944 --> 01:02:09,652
You're much stronger
than they are.

1120
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,874
Where did that come from?

1121
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:24,208
I'm so used to being
disappointed,

1122
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:27,045
you're kind of a
nice change of pace.

1123
01:02:57,742 --> 01:02:59,075
[both chuckle]

1124
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:14,297
What you're saying
is that you lied to me.

1125
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,840
They told me
not to say anything.

1126
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:17,467
And you do everything
people tell you?

1127
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:19,302
-No.
-This is not her fault.

1128
01:03:19,346 --> 01:03:20,970
These girls are dangerous.

1129
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,305
Why can't you see that?

1130
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:24,182
All I see is a bunch of kids
that got carried away.

1131
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:26,017
Aren't you going
to do anything?

1132
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:27,727
Sure.

1133
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:30,021
I'll shake up every
fraternity and sorority
on campus.

1134
01:03:30,065 --> 01:03:31,480
And you know when I'll get?

1135
01:03:32,483 --> 01:03:33,732
Silence.

1136
01:03:39,323 --> 01:03:40,697
We already told you.

1137
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:43,283
You can't keep asking us
the same questions.

1138
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:45,077
What you're saying is...

1139
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,745
that none of you is responsible

1140
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,289
for the markings on her body.

1141
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:52,083
And nobody noticed when
Shelby Blake just wandered off

1142
01:03:52,127 --> 01:03:54,418
on her own the other night?

1143
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:58,548
Nobody knows anything
about eating glass?

1144
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,341
Initiations in the clock tower.

1145
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:04,137
In fact, not a one of you
knows a damn thing.

1146
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,514
Is that right?

1147
01:04:06,558 --> 01:04:09,267
Well this innocent school girl
act is really

1148
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,394
starting to irritate me.

1149
01:04:11,437 --> 01:04:13,019
Somebody better start talking,

1150
01:04:13,063 --> 01:04:15,564
or I can make this very
uncomfortable.

1151
01:04:17,192 --> 01:04:18,441
How about you?

1152
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:23,989
Both my parents are lawyers.

1153
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,490
Maybe I should
call and ask them

1154
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:30,745
-the definition of harassment.
-Oh, I see. I see...

1155
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:32,789
You girls want to make this
difficult, huh?

1156
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,082
That's fine.

1157
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:38,210
I can be difficult.

1158
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:26,506
[Shelby screaming]

1159
01:05:29,762 --> 01:05:31,386
[Lisa sobs] Shelby.

1160
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:45,316
Are you sure you don't
want me to come over with you?

1161
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,443
I don't mind.

1162
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:49,862
They were just
trying to scare me.

1163
01:05:49,906 --> 01:05:51,989
It won't be as easy to do
in daylight.

1164
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:54,408
Okay.

1165
01:05:54,452 --> 01:05:56,243
So what are you going to do?

1166
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,413
I'm going to try
and talk to Paige.

1167
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,333
I think she may
know something.

1168
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:07,629
Don't do anything risky,
all right.

1169
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:10,298
It's not worth you
getting hurt over.

1170
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,801
Okay? Promise?

1171
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,178
Promise.

1172
01:06:42,872 --> 01:06:44,622
Hi.

1173
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,874
-Mom?
-I drove down to see you.

1174
01:06:46,918 --> 01:06:49,669
I guess I should have called
first.

1175
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:51,921
How long have you been here?

1176
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:54,716
About 6:30 this morning.

1177
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:57,343
I guess you didn't sleep
here last night, huh?

1178
01:07:03,183 --> 01:07:05,225
[sighs] Your friend Drea called.

1179
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:07,853
She's really worried about you.

1180
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,479
There's more to it
than you think.

1181
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:11,523
You know what honey?
I think you're still in shock

1182
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,025
about what happened.

1183
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:14,776
I'm not in shock--

1184
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,778
Look, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

1185
01:07:16,822 --> 01:07:18,113
It's going to take some time.

1186
01:07:18,157 --> 01:07:21,198
I've spoken to your friends
at the house and--

1187
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:23,284
Those aren't my friends.

1188
01:07:25,538 --> 01:07:28,372
Look, Lisa I know you want to
blame someone

1189
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,415
for all of this,

1190
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,000
but it's no one's fault.

1191
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:33,586
They're just as devastated
by Shelby's death as you are.

1192
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:35,963
Forget about it, Mom.

1193
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:38,341
You know, there's no need
to use that tone with me.

1194
01:07:38,384 --> 01:07:39,632
I'm just trying to help.

1195
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:41,760
-Then listen to what I'm saying.
-I am listening.

1196
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:43,094
But this is not...

1197
01:07:43,138 --> 01:07:45,597
This is when you need your
friends the most.

1198
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,723
Don't shut them out.

1199
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:48,475
I'm not going back
to that house.

1200
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,727
I can't make it
any simpler than that.

1201
01:07:50,771 --> 01:07:54,814
Okay, then why don't you just
come home with me

1202
01:07:54,858 --> 01:07:56,316
for a few days.

1203
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,567
Take some time away.

1204
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:00,028
Then you'll see
how important it is to you.

1205
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:01,737
It's important to you.

1206
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:03,864
I joined so that you'd
be proud of me.

1207
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:05,532
You don't understand.

1208
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:07,076
Never mind.

1209
01:08:08,537 --> 01:08:10,162
[loud party music playing]

1210
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:12,581
[kids chattering]

1211
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:19,463
[party music and chatter]

1212
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:16,767
You crashing the party?

1213
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:18,185
I want to talk to Paige.

1214
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:20,980
Well, I don't think she's much
in the mood for talking.

1215
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,273
Maybe I should ask her.

1216
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:27,527
Maybe... you should
shut the hell up.

1217
01:09:27,571 --> 01:09:30,071
There's been cops all over
the road because of you.

1218
01:09:34,411 --> 01:09:38,037
Trust me, you have no idea
what you're inviting.

1219
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:42,750
It can get really ugly.

1220
01:09:42,794 --> 01:09:45,169
Is that what you want?

1221
01:09:47,256 --> 01:09:49,381
We can take care of that
right now.

1222
01:09:49,425 --> 01:09:51,592
Make sure you don't go
spouting your mouth off.

1223
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:40,055
-Are you Lisa Connors?
-Yes.

1224
01:10:40,098 --> 01:10:42,641
You were just visiting a
fraternity over on 28th Street?

1225
01:10:42,684 --> 01:10:45,185
Yeah, I was there
for a few minutes.

1226
01:10:48,606 --> 01:10:50,356
I need you to get out
of the car, please.

1227
01:10:51,901 --> 01:10:53,484
What did I do?

1228
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:56,570
What have we got there?

1229
01:10:56,614 --> 01:10:58,322
That's not mine.

1230
01:10:58,366 --> 01:11:00,491
Course is not. Put your hands
behind your back, please.

1231
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:01,825
This is a mistake.

1232
01:11:03,287 --> 01:11:04,870
You have the right to remain
silent.

1233
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:06,497
Anything you say
can and will be

1234
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,331
used against you
in a court of law.

1235
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,791
You have the right
to an attorney.

1236
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:11,543
If you can't afford one...

1237
01:11:13,004 --> 01:11:15,213
What the hell is going on?

1238
01:11:15,257 --> 01:11:16,756
I told you. They set me up.

1239
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,551
Lisa. You cannot keep making
things up

1240
01:11:19,594 --> 01:11:21,219
just to escape the truth.

1241
01:11:21,263 --> 01:11:23,930
Why is it so hard
for you to believe me?

1242
01:11:23,974 --> 01:11:27,058
Because people don't
do this to one another.

1243
01:11:27,102 --> 01:11:28,684
You mean sorority sisters
don't.

1244
01:11:31,146 --> 01:11:33,063
Lisa...

1245
01:11:33,107 --> 01:11:35,649
I know how difficult this must
be for you to deal with,

1246
01:11:35,693 --> 01:11:37,568
but this is not the way.

1247
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:42,281
It wasn't mine.

1248
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:44,616
You know, you're lucky that they
let you off with a warning.

1249
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,660
I just want to make sure
that it doesn't happen again.

1250
01:11:46,704 --> 01:11:48,786
So...We'll get help.

1251
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:52,039
Okay. I can go with you
if you like.

1252
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:54,083
Mom, I know you don't
believe me,

1253
01:11:54,127 --> 01:11:56,544
but something happened
up on that roof.

1254
01:11:56,588 --> 01:11:58,963
Something they don't want
anyone to know about.

1255
01:12:01,134 --> 01:12:03,009
I'm going to have to stay in
town for a couple of days

1256
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,469
until this mess gets cleared up.

1257
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:06,512
But you know something,

1258
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,014
I think it would
be best after that

1259
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,723
if you came home with me,
where I can keep an eye on you.

1260
01:12:09,766 --> 01:12:11,141
I don't need you to keep
an eye on me.

1261
01:12:11,184 --> 01:12:12,392
I can handle my life on my own.

1262
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:14,603
Really? I used to think so.

1263
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:16,146
Now, I'm not so sure.

1264
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:26,740
What do you want?

1265
01:12:26,783 --> 01:12:28,283
I want to know who planted
the drugs.

1266
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,659
Don't blame us if you have
a drug problem.

1267
01:12:30,703 --> 01:12:31,994
Was it you Terry?

1268
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:35,164
Lisa, you're out of control.

1269
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:37,041
You guys are hiding something.

1270
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:39,126
You have been ever since the
night of the tower.

1271
01:12:40,838 --> 01:12:42,630
If we are,
it's for your own good.

1272
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:45,299
You swore an oath, Lisa.

1273
01:12:45,343 --> 01:12:47,593
An oath you sealed with blood,
that you'd protect the house

1274
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:48,677
and all the sisters in it.

1275
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:51,179
What about the sister
that's dead?

1276
01:12:51,222 --> 01:12:53,389
Just let it drop.

1277
01:12:53,433 --> 01:12:54,849
It's better for everyone
this way.

1278
01:12:54,893 --> 01:12:56,392
I won't let it drop.

1279
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:59,145
Not until I get the truth

1280
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:00,897
Were trying to protect you.

1281
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,190
Me?

1282
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,608
Of course, why do you
think Shelby was up there

1283
01:13:03,652 --> 01:13:05,401
in the first place.

1284
01:13:05,445 --> 01:13:07,612
What are you talking about?

1285
01:13:07,656 --> 01:13:11,323
She was trying to prove she
was just as good as you, Lisa.

1286
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:13,367
Didn't you understand that?

1287
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:15,786
She kept saying you were
prettier and smarter

1288
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:17,996
and more popular than she was.

1289
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,457
That's why she kept pushing
herself.

1290
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:26,672
We didn't want you to
have to live with this.

1291
01:13:26,715 --> 01:13:28,048
We tried to be good sisters,

1292
01:13:28,092 --> 01:13:30,425
but you couldn't let it go,
could you?

1293
01:13:32,095 --> 01:13:34,220
All we wanted to
do was protect you.

1294
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,922
So how did you finally
track her down?

1295
01:14:55,966 --> 01:14:57,257
Through the finance department.

1296
01:14:57,301 --> 01:14:59,009
Her name is Anne-Marie Johnson,

1297
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:00,802
and the school wrote her
a pretty nice check.

1298
01:15:00,846 --> 01:15:03,597
A check doesn't
prove she was hazed.

1299
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,265
You're the one who
insisted on coming along.

1300
01:15:05,309 --> 01:15:08,185
If you don't believe it,
Why are you even here?

1301
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:11,480
Let's just see
what she has to say. Okay?

1302
01:15:17,528 --> 01:15:19,028
Yes?

1303
01:15:19,071 --> 01:15:20,946
I really thought I was
going to die.

1304
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:23,532
I mean, that car's
headlights...

1305
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:27,411
[Anne-Marie whimpers]

1306
01:15:30,082 --> 01:15:32,041
[screams]

1307
01:15:35,087 --> 01:15:36,419
[Steven] But they stopped.

1308
01:15:37,255 --> 01:15:38,713
Barely.

1309
01:15:38,757 --> 01:15:40,673
[Lisa] Were you hurt?

1310
01:15:40,717 --> 01:15:42,675
Not physically too bad.

1311
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,512
I was just kind of messed up
for a while.

1312
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:50,141
It just didn't seem fair.

1313
01:15:50,185 --> 01:15:52,268
I was so mad.

1314
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:53,728
I was supposed to be

1315
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:57,981
the first person in my family
to get a college degree.

1316
01:15:58,025 --> 01:16:00,025
You know?

1317
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:02,945
It just didn't seem very fair.

1318
01:16:04,615 --> 01:16:05,864
I don't understand.

1319
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:08,867
Why didn't you tell anybody?

1320
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:10,244
The school offered me some money

1321
01:16:10,287 --> 01:16:12,788
if I didn't say anything.

1322
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:14,748
And to tell you the truth,

1323
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,834
that was fine with me.

1324
01:16:16,877 --> 01:16:20,127
I mean, no way was I going
to go back there.

1325
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:23,172
I knew the Pi Gamms would just
make my life miserable.

1326
01:16:24,259 --> 01:16:25,842
The Pi Gamms?

1327
01:16:25,885 --> 01:16:28,052
Yeah, Pi Gamma Beta.

1328
01:16:28,096 --> 01:16:29,262
That was my sorority.

1329
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:32,223
[Anne Marie] Do you know it?

1330
01:16:33,268 --> 01:16:34,517
Yeah.

1331
01:16:55,205 --> 01:16:58,206
I can't print a story like this
without solid proof.

1332
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,331
Carl, what more do you want?

1333
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:00,374
I got an interview.

1334
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:01,750
This school has
paid this girl off

1335
01:17:01,794 --> 01:17:03,252
to keep her quiet.

1336
01:17:03,296 --> 01:17:05,629
You have the word
of one bitter ex-student.

1337
01:17:05,673 --> 01:17:08,299
Come on, that's not enough
for this size accusation.

1338
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:10,718
You know that every word
on that page is true.

1339
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:12,595
All I know is I can't...

1340
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:15,890
I can't print this story.

1341
01:17:18,144 --> 01:17:20,059
This wasn't your
decision, was it?

1342
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,646
I'm sorry.

1343
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,773
Technically, the paper
is controlled

1344
01:17:25,817 --> 01:17:27,817
by Anders' administration.

1345
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:32,488
Well...

1346
01:17:32,532 --> 01:17:35,116
So much for freedom
of the press.

1347
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,618
I'm afraid that's not all.

1348
01:17:38,163 --> 01:17:40,495
As of today, you are no longer
on staff.

1349
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,551
It's all been lies.

1350
01:17:54,595 --> 01:17:56,595
First they said she was
drinking,

1351
01:17:56,639 --> 01:17:58,847
then they said it was my fault.

1352
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:00,307
It's all been lies.

1353
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:03,267
Well, everybody here seems
happy with the lies.

1354
01:18:09,734 --> 01:18:12,485
[Lisa] Steven.
Let go of me.

1355
01:18:13,947 --> 01:18:16,656
-[man] Let's go. Let's go.
-[Lisa] Steven.

1356
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:18,741
-[Lisa] Steven.
-Lisa.

1357
01:18:21,995 --> 01:18:25,538
-[Lisa whimpers]
-[man] Stay down.

1358
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:28,833
You want to live
through this night?

1359
01:18:28,877 --> 01:18:30,961
Better just chill.

1360
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,104
This is what happens to people
who break their vows.

1361
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:52,773
[Lisa] Let me go.

1362
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:55,693
Next time, stay out of other
people's business. Okay?

1363
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:57,403
Okay.

1364
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:08,579
[ragged breathing]

1365
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,418
[distant car horn honks]

1366
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:19,424
[honking continues]

1367
01:19:34,648 --> 01:19:35,981
[car honks]

1368
01:19:57,336 --> 01:20:00,046
Oh my God.

1369
01:20:00,089 --> 01:20:02,048
I've looked
everywhere for you.

1370
01:20:04,469 --> 01:20:06,342
I'm so happy to see you.

1371
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,138
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

1372
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,602
Look at you.

1373
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:17,270
Look at what
they did to you.

1374
01:20:19,191 --> 01:20:20,440
I was so scared.

1375
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,485
I thought I'd lost you for good.

1376
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,948
[kisses] Come on.

1377
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,746
I was searching all night.
I can't believe I found you.

1378
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:12,948
There has to be something
else we can do.

1379
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:16,576
I've got people searching
everywhere.

1380
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,619
We'll find her.

1381
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,875
I was so stupid.

1382
01:21:23,919 --> 01:21:27,587
What kind of mother doesn't
believe in her own daughter?

1383
01:21:37,056 --> 01:21:38,264
Mrs. Connors.

1384
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:43,477
Hi, Mom.

1385
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:46,230
Oh, you're all right.

1386
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,825
I am so sorry.

1387
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:07,542
I don't know why I
didn't listen to you.

1388
01:22:08,712 --> 01:22:10,127
It's just that sometimes

1389
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:12,796
it's hard for me to realize
that you're all grown up.

1390
01:22:19,972 --> 01:22:22,806
The next time I try to tell you
how to live your life,

1391
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,933
will you do me a favor?

1392
01:22:24,977 --> 01:22:28,103
Will you tell me to mind
my own business?

1393
01:22:28,147 --> 01:22:30,397
I might just take you
up on that.

1394
01:22:33,276 --> 01:22:34,442
Good.

1395
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:46,704
Kim! You've got a message.

1396
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,540
What?

1397
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:50,833
Lisa called.

1398
01:22:50,877 --> 01:22:53,210
She wanted you to
meet her at the clock tower.

1399
01:22:54,046 --> 01:22:55,128
She said to tell you

1400
01:22:55,172 --> 01:22:57,297
she's bringing
Anne-Marie Johnson along.

1401
01:22:57,341 --> 01:22:59,174
Lisa said she's
an old friend of yours.

1402
01:23:14,774 --> 01:23:18,567
[bell tolls]

1403
01:23:38,505 --> 01:23:39,837
Where's Anne-Marie?

1404
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,215
She couldn't make it.

1405
01:23:42,259 --> 01:23:44,008
I told you she was bluffing.

1406
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,010
I wasn't.

1407
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,263
[Anne Marie's voice] <i>I don't</i>
<i>remember all their names,</i>

1408
01:23:48,306 --> 01:23:50,056
<i>just the driver.</i>

1409
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,100
<i>Her name was Kim.</i>

1410
01:23:52,143 --> 01:23:53,809
<i>Kim Lessing.</i>

1411
01:23:56,313 --> 01:23:58,605
What happened this time, Kim?

1412
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:01,566
Did you push her?

1413
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:03,777
Or did you just tell Shelby
to be the best pledge

1414
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:05,320
she had to learn to fly?

1415
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:08,907
It wasn't me...

1416
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:11,243
I didn't do anything.

1417
01:24:11,287 --> 01:24:12,327
It was her.

1418
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,996
Kim...

1419
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:16,205
She just kept pushing and
pushing her.

1420
01:24:18,876 --> 01:24:20,751
[girls laugh]

1421
01:24:20,795 --> 01:24:23,045
Now all you have to
do is just hang it...

1422
01:24:23,715 --> 01:24:24,839
out there.

1423
01:24:24,882 --> 01:24:27,258
[Kim] They'll be able
to see it for miles.

1424
01:24:27,302 --> 01:24:28,509
[laughs]

1425
01:24:34,434 --> 01:24:36,975
I can't. I can't.
It's too high.

1426
01:24:37,019 --> 01:24:39,519
Don't be such a baby.

1427
01:24:39,563 --> 01:24:43,356
Really, I gotta go back down.

1428
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,942
You want to win the sisterhood
award...

1429
01:24:45,986 --> 01:24:47,277
don't you Shelby?

1430
01:24:49,865 --> 01:24:50,947
Why are you doing this?

1431
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:54,701
It all happened so fast.

1432
01:24:54,745 --> 01:24:55,784
I'm serious.

1433
01:24:55,828 --> 01:24:58,495
I'm really really
afraid of heights.

1434
01:24:58,539 --> 01:24:59,788
I get sick and stuff.

1435
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:01,665
You have to get over your fears.

1436
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:03,876
Trust us, Shelby.

1437
01:25:05,963 --> 01:25:08,047
We're your sisters.

1438
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,007
No, I can't.

1439
01:25:10,051 --> 01:25:12,718
Do it!

1440
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:15,137
I told you to just get up there
and hang it!

1441
01:25:17,599 --> 01:25:19,223
Do it, Shelby!

1442
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:28,858
Do it!

1443
01:25:40,662 --> 01:25:42,245
[Shelby screams]

1444
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:43,622
Shelby!

1445
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:54,132
We made Paige swear not to tell.

1446
01:25:54,176 --> 01:25:56,593
It was an accident.

1447
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:58,969
Why didn't you just
leave it alone?

1448
01:25:59,013 --> 01:26:00,638
It's not like we weren't sorry.

1449
01:26:00,681 --> 01:26:02,807
This is the second time
it happened, Drea.

1450
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,642
When did you think it
would stop?

1451
01:26:04,685 --> 01:26:06,227
I wish I could go back
and change it all,

1452
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,520
but I can't.

1453
01:26:08,398 --> 01:26:09,605
What do you want?

1454
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:12,066
I want to make sure
it never happens again.

1455
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:13,526
No you don't.

1456
01:26:13,569 --> 01:26:15,986
You just want
to destroy the house.

1457
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,321
We took you in...

1458
01:26:18,449 --> 01:26:20,615
made you a part of our family.

1459
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:23,701
Don't you understand
how important that is?

1460
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,287
It's not more important
than someone's life.

1461
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:28,873
Nothing's that important.

1462
01:26:36,466 --> 01:26:38,174
It's strange...

1463
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:40,008
I thought, knowing what
really happened,

1464
01:26:40,052 --> 01:26:42,636
would make me feel better.

1465
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,305
But the truth is, nothing can
bring Shelby back.

1466
01:26:54,483 --> 01:26:55,941
It's a shame, you know.

1467
01:26:58,904 --> 01:27:01,070
She was so excited
when she got in.

1468
01:27:02,574 --> 01:27:05,032
She thought it was going
to be one big party.

1469
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:22,174
All I can tell
you at this point,

1470
01:27:22,217 --> 01:27:24,217
is that two women from
Shelby's Blake's sorority

1471
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:25,594
have come forward.

1472
01:27:25,637 --> 01:27:28,096
They've admitted to being...

1473
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,639
connected to the accident.

1474
01:27:29,683 --> 01:27:31,892
Now, would you classify these
activities as hazing?

1475
01:27:34,313 --> 01:27:36,188
Yes.

1476
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:38,523
And...what do you plan to do
about it?.

1477
01:27:41,694 --> 01:27:43,611
Well, clearly, the University
will have to look

1478
01:27:43,654 --> 01:27:45,946
into the depth of problem.

1479
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:49,617
And this is a situation
that we intend to rectify.

1480
01:28:05,759 --> 01:28:06,799
What a waste.

1481
01:28:10,472 --> 01:28:12,639
I'm sorry, Mom.

1482
01:28:12,682 --> 01:28:14,057
I know it meant
a lot to you.

1483
01:28:16,561 --> 01:28:18,770
You know, I don't think it was
the sorority at all.

1484
01:28:18,813 --> 01:28:22,190
I think it was the people
there that I loved.

1485
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:24,608
The house was just a way
of bringing us together.

1486
01:28:25,861 --> 01:28:27,653
I'll miss having that.

1487
01:28:27,696 --> 01:28:30,197
[Steven] Hopefully you won't
miss it too much.

1488
01:28:30,241 --> 01:28:33,992
[Lisa] Well, if I do,
it's my own fault.

1489
01:28:34,036 --> 01:28:37,079
I mean, it's not like
there's nothing else to do here.

1490
01:28:52,595 --> 01:28:54,804
