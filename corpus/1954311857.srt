Can't catch me, slowpoke.

Scruffy, where are you going?
We're gonna be late for story time.

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,713
- Scruffy, come back.
- Whoa.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,634
Ha! I lost her.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,716
Whoopee!

- Sore loser.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,670
- Are we late, Anabelle?
- It was all her fault.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,995
Was not.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,476
Do you angels want to
hear this story or not?

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,398
Oh, yes, Anabelle.

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,239
OK, OK, OK.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,874
This is a holiday story

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,189
about three ghosts,
two bad dogs, and an evil witch.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,998
- Ghosts?
- <i>(whimpering)</i>

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,639
Huh! So it <i>is</i> a dumb old fairy tale.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,877
No. No, no, no. It's all true.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,470
In fact, the witch was my evil cousin,

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,750
Belladonna.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,150
You mean the Boogy-Dog?

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,679
Yes.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,559
This is how my two best guardian angels
tried to stop her from ruining Christmas.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,233
- Meet Charles Barkin and ltchy ltchiford.
- Are they the ghosts?

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,232
Well, I'll start at the beginning
and let you figure it out.

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,232
It was Christmas Eve, and San Francisco
was preparing for a beautiful, silent night.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,316

Charlie, I got the stuff.

Just remember to donate
something for Timmy.

Yes, and it's really gonna help
the little guy, Charlie.

96
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,992
Look at him. Every day his leg gets worse,
but he never complains.

97

Man, I hope the little squirt
gets that operation. He deserves it.

- Charlie. Woof!
- Hey, I know.

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,719
Hey, how about we distract
the little tykes with another song?

101
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,593
Yeah, let's all sing now.

102
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,714

What? Ten? No. I only borrowed four.

Interest, honey. I'm running
a business, not a charity.

Wow, Mom.

342
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,437
- I miss you.
- Come, we have other places to see.

343
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,835
But I wanna watch how cute I am.

344
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,356
What the?

345
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,198
Hey, what took ya?

346
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,199
Hey, it's the Parker house.

347
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,560
This was my first human family.

348
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,875
And there's Bobby.

349
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,833
And there I am. There I am.

350
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,990
I got away with murder in this place.

351
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,279
Yeah, right from the get-go
I was a heck-raiser, boy.

352
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,949
Just like now. Sharp, slick, fast-livin'.

353
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,559
<i>(chuckles)</i>

354
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,390
<i>* When the lights go out,
I dream about my puppyhood

355
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,513
<i>* And this pint-sized mug
who took me in one day

356
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,834
<i>* Oh, sure, I broke a rule or two

357
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,713
<i>* The same as any puppy would

358
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,311
<i>* But in these crazy dreams
I still can hear him say

359
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,152
<i>* "You didn't mean to do it, Carface"

360
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,790
<i>* "I guess ya kinda blew it, Carface"

361
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,793
<i>* "But I'm gonna see ya through it all,
cos you're my pal"

362
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,031
<i>* I gotta admit

363
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,516
<i>* Yeah, we was tight,
that squirt was all right

364
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,155
<i>* We used to trash the joint
from 6am to midnight

365
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,478
<i>* Play tag and all them indoor sports
like tug of war with boxer shorts

366
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,674
<i>* Had what you'd call a regular ball
and Christmas was funnest of all

367
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,236
<i>* Boxes of steaks,
plum pudding and cakes

368
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,989
<i>* Hey, who knew teddy bears' insides
looked just like snowflakes?

369
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,238
<i>* But then too many hours had passed,
I had to make a pit stop fast

370
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,150
<i>* I couldn't see, unfortunately,
no powder room under the tree

371
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,073
<i>(sigh of relief)</i>

372
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,274
<i>* When you're double-crossed,
it's like you lost your puppyhood

373
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,678
<i>* If he'd copped a plea
we would have been OK

374
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,630
<i>* I swear I musta held it
twice as long as any puppy could

375
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,354
<i>* And when that dame yelled "Scram!"

376
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,153
<i>* I hoped the kid would say

377
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,314
<i>* "You didn't mean to do it, Carface"

378
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,230
<i>* "I guess you kinda blew it, Carface"

379
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,118
<i>* "But I'm gonna see ya through it all,
cos you're my pal"

380
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,390
But he didn't say it, did he?

381
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,592
- Aw, man.
- Nah, the kid blamed it all on me.

382
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,951
So I stopped being a good little pup
and turned into a hood.

383
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,275
Yadda-yadda-yadda.

384
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,039
<i>* He was a sweetie pie who turned into a...

385
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,955
<i>* Puppy hood

386
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,591
Anyways, nowadays, talk about pals.

387
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,358
<i>* I got me a pack

388
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,314
<i>* The meanest mutts
who ever threw a game of blackjack

389
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,910
<i>* We hit the dumpsters then the dumps,
kicked Chihuahuas' puny rumps

390
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,592
<i>* At night I snooze wherever I choose,
ain't no way on earth I can lose

391
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,233
<i>* But when the lights go out,
I dream about my puppyhood

392
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,989
<i>* And in these crazy dreams
I never hear him say

393
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,877
<i>* "You didn't mean to do it, Carface"

394
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,790
<i>* "I guess you kinda blew it, Carface"

395
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:30,238
<i>* "But I'm gonna see ya through it all,
cos you're my pal"

396
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,992
<i>(ltchy)</i> Aw, poor little guy.

397
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,350
<i>(Carface)</i> Tell me about it.

398
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,276
<i>(whimpers)</i>

399
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,716
From that day on
I never trusted nobody again.

400
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,990
And that nobody includes you!

401
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,588
I'd forgot how much I hated Christmas.

402
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,792
Thanks for reminding me, ya dumb ghost!

403
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,708
Ya dumb ghost, ya dumb ghost, ya...

404
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,389
Oh. Huh?

405
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,276
Oh.

406
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,595
Just a bad dream.

407
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,076
I musta ate some bad
moo goo or somethin'.

408

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,997
Ah, let's go to sleep.

412
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,190
Bah! Humbug!

414
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,875
Ltchy. So, how'd it go?

415
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,673
Not good. Carface is madder than ever.

416
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,680
I didn't know he had
such a rough puppyhood.

417
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,712
A lot of us did,
but we didn't all go turnin' nasty.

418
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,037
We're just gonna have to
work a little harder.

419
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,312
But, Charlie, there's only
an hour and a half left till Christmas.

420
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,312
I know that, ltch. That's why we've got to
unleash part two of the miracle.

421
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,878
Come ye storms and grow in strife,

422
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,231
split the sky with lightning rife.

423
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,794
Strike at midnight, like a knife,

424
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,469
and bring to my creation life!

425
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,637

- Wow!
- No, I can't. This plan is evil.

682
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,194
I gotta stop the plan.
Yeah, I gotta stop that plan.

683
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,836
You're mumbling, boss.
You need some more rest?

684

No, it's not right. It's not.
