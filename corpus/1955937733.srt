[Suspense Music]

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,127
- [Eli] We are a family.

3
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:09,210
We are each an arm, a leg, or a hand,

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,430
each important and trusted.

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,261
We give each other purpose,

6
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:21,730
and we introduce chaos to
disrupt the banality of this life

7
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,898
to make aware what is truly important.

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,720
- Why can't I go with you?

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,148
- Taylor, I told you already.

10
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,021
Karen, will you deal with this, please?

11
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:34,610
- Okay. Taylor, honey,

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,031
mommy and dadddy are going on a date.

13
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,330
Uncle Raymond and aunt
Sharon are gonna watch you.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,210
- So I have to be stuck here with them?

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,300
- You're not stuck
here, don't be a victim.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,800
Nobody likes that.

17
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,379
And when you're older,
you'll go on plenty of dates,

18
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,318
just like this one.

19
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,268
- Fine.

20
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:52,919
- Taylor, what did I just say?

21
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,047
- Don't be a victim.

22
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:55,879
- Right.

23
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,420
In bed before nine.

24

(suspense music)

26
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,857
- There should be a gas station coming up.

27
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,190
- We'll be fine.

28
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:44,717
- There could be people.

29
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,444
- It'll be fine.

30
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:51,027
(radio playing calm music)

31
00:01:56,498 --> 00:02:00,547
- Watch out.
(tires screeching)

32
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:03,297
(suspense music)

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,465
- You're alright?

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,790
What you're doing out here?

35
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:18,597
- Stuff.

36
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,788
- Do you need a ride?

37
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:22,740
- Yeah, why won't you come with us?

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,887
- Are you guys sure? I don't wanna be a...

39
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:26,408
- Oh no, not at all.

40
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:30,325
(group talking at a low voice)

41
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,854
(doorbell rings)

42
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:46,456
(suspense music)

43
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,151
(door opening)

44
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,561
- Hey, come on in.

45
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:55,331
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

46
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,414
Just straight over there.

47
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,669
- They should be here by now.

48
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,836
- It will be fine, they've
done this dozens of times.

49
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:23,088
- [Eli] Hey, you okay?

50
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,787
- Where are you heading?

51
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:34,954
Your family must miss you.

52
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:41,368
- Hey man, could you slow down.

53
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,728
- You're gonna be alright?

54
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:46,311
(man in backseat coughing)

55
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:52,213
- Hey man, just-come on.

56
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,046
Pull over.

57
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:00,761
(man in backseat coughing)

58
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,511
(suspense music)

59
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,495
- Isn't someone here
supposed to be asleep by now?

60
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,255
- We're not supposed
to have strangers over

61
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:28,843
when mom and dad are not home.

62
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:31,510
- These aren't strangers, honey.

63
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,162
They're family.

64
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,436
Come on, go to bed.

65
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:43,044
(suspense music)

66
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,854
- It's a creepy mask.

67
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,211
- Oh, don't run.

68
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,344
- You won't get far.

69
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:19,214
(bone smashing)

70
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:21,784
(screams)

71
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,534
(suspense music)

72
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,482
(car breaking)

73
00:05:42,494 --> 00:05:45,244
- (Eli) Take it.

74
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,943
- What the hell happened?

75
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:51,174
- Nothing. We're here.

76
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,043
- Taylor's asleep?

77
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,294
- Of course.

78
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:55,294
- We should get started.

79
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,482
- We are a family.

80
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,686
We are each an arm, a leg, or a hand.

81
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:08,773
Each important and trusted.

82
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:12,614
We give each other purpose

83
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:17,109
and we introduce chaos to disrupt
the banality of this life,

84
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,360
to make aware where is truly important.

85
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,494
And as families do, we grow.

86
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,643
But not all at once,

87
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:28,893
but with careful selection.

88
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:32,096
And today, we have one more.

89
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:39,134
To usher in new blood,

90
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:41,134
we must spill old blood.

91
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:45,037
For you cannot take

92
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:47,724
what you cannot give.

93
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,515
So let us rise as a group

94
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,739
and support our sister.

95
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,429
(suspense music growing)

96
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:17,217
(knife cutting)

97
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,883
(blood gushing)

98
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:22,086
- [Karen] Taylor?

99
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,285
(door banging)

100
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:26,365
(knocking on door)

101
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:27,685
Taylor?

102
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:30,315
Open up, I can explain.

103
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,544
(knocking on door)

104
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:36,664
I need you to be a big girl
and open up the door, okay?

105
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,914
(forcing door to open)

106
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:02,114
You weren't supposed to see that.

107
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:05,778
Taylor,

108
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:10,704
sunny,

109
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:11,537
baby,

110
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:14,503
we're a family,

111
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:16,337
all of us.

112
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:20,711
Everyone that you saw down there,

113
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,628
they wanna protect you.

114
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,817
We get rid of bad people.

115
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,953
We all love you, Taylor.

116
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:38,512
But for now, you have to
keep this a secret, alright?

117
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:43,010
You can't tell anyone, do you understand?

118
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:49,684
And remember, never act like a victim,

119
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,851
and you never will be one.

120
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:56,993
(high-intensity suspense music)

121
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:06,595
(suspense music)

122
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,169
- How can we not know?

123
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:27,553
That's not how this works, figure it out.

124
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,074
- Why can't I go?

125
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,496
- Taylor, you're too young.

126
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,376
- I already know everything though.

127
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,274
- There's a difference between
knowing about something

128
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:38,906
and actually participating in it.

129
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:41,914
- I understand that, I
just think it's stupid.

130
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,164
- Yeah, me too.

131
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:46,088
- Go.

132
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,473
- This entire situation is just sad.

133
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:54,890
Now, someone else is pretending to be us.

134
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,633
What happened to you guys?

135
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,991
(indistinct conversation)

136
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:18,656
- [Eli] She's not wrong.

137
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:19,925
- She's 12.

138
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,344
- She's already seen everything,
she knows everything.

139
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:23,894
At this point, what's the difference?

140
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:26,408
- She's just a child, Eli.

141
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:29,386
- She's already rationalizing
things the same level we are,

142
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,539
we might as well involve her.

143
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,089
- This isn't a debate.

144
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,700
- These people pretending to be us,

145
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,367
they killed a child.

146
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:41,569
- We can't just use her,

147
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,236
don't you get how wrong that is?

148
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,814
(door squeaking)

149
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:55,578
(suspense music)

150
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,584
(knocking on door)

151
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,785
- I'm sorry, mister.

152
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,993
I got locked out of my house
and my parents aren't home,

153
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:37,506
and I just really need to
use the phone to call them.

154
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,673
Can I come in?

155
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:51,438
Thanks.

156
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:54,415
(phone dialing)

157
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:56,997
(ringing tone)

158
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:04,595
(voicemail message playing)

159
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,928
I can try again in a minute.

160
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:09,675
- You know, it must be really scary,

161
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,305
on your own this late.

162
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:14,004
Specially with everything
that's been happening, you know?

163
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,436
That poor girl.

164
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:18,353
- Yeah. I guess it is pretty scary.

165
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:23,996
I wouldn't wanna be the
person who did that.

166
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,995
They're gonna be in trouble.

167
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,578
- Well, the cops don't
even know who it is.

168
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:38,659
- Well, cops don't.

169
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,576
(knocking on door)

170
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:48,804
- Fuck.

171
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:55,200
- They say imitation is the
highest form of flattery.

172
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
But copycats are different.

173
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,072
They're cowards, and plus,
you got it all wrong.

174
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,352
We don't kill children.

175
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,730
(knife plunging)

176
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,416
- This is gonna be bad.

177
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,166
(knife plunging)

178
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:23,879
- I'm gonna tell you this one
time and you are gonna listen.

179
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,879
You don't ever, ever, do that again.

180
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,037
This whole thing, everything
that we have and are, it's me.

181
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:36,071
You don't change the plan,
you don't say a word,

182
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,821
unless I tell you to.

183
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:48,151
(high-intensity suspense music)

184
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:57,179
(playful, mysterious music)

185
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,294
- Smooth, eh?

186
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:20,961
(suspense music)

187
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:28,510
- Are you sure no one's here?

188
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,510
- I promise.

189
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,393
(Taylor laughs)

190
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,364
Shit, get down.

191
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:36,983
- You're so lame.

192
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:38,492
- That's right, I can't help it.

193
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:39,783
- Maybe we should just go.

194
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:42,673
- No, Taylor, Taylor, come
on, I was just kidding.

195
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,256
And I'm sorry. Look, it's fine.

196
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,427
It's fine. Come on.

197
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:02,038
(lustful, mysteriouus music)

198
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:36,829
- You ever just wish
things were different?

199
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:42,219
- I mean, like, I wish that I
could teleport or something.

200
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,209
Oh, or not live in a dorm.

201
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:52,338
- No, like, you ever wish you
were just somewhere different?

202
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,173
Like you could do whatever you want,

203
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:57,400
not have to answer to anyone,

204
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,483
or follow anyone's rules?

205
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:01,372
- Yeah?

206
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:03,607
I mean,

207
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,322
I get that.

208
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:12,305
But here we are together.

209
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:17,174
Plus, if you were somewhere else then

210
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,424
where would I be right now?

211
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,372
- Maybe you're right.

212
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:35,276
Maybe I have you right where I want you.

213
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:37,608
- You know I like you a lot.

214
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:43,334
(abrupt blast)

215
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,324
- I thought you said they were gone.

216
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,614
- I did, they were, they are.

217
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:47,947
- Obviously not.

218
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:56,563
Let's just hide in here
until they go to sleep.

219
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,421
(door squeaking open)

220
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:10,234
I'm glad we're here.

221
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:11,068
- Yeah?

222
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:17,654
- It's just my family is
really important to me.

223
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:21,940
- That's kind of a weird thing to say.

224
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:27,094
(abrupt blast)

225
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,636
What the fuck?

226
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:31,916
Fuck. Taylor, what the fuck is going on?

227
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,886
- I can't help it.

228
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,366
- You said you want
things to be different.

229
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:36,283
I can't be.

230
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:38,822
I can't be.

231
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,854
I thought we had something.

232
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,645
Taylor, I didn't even tell
my parents where I am.

233
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:49,978
- Taylor, this is what we came here for.

234
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:51,917
- Taylor.

235
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:53,849
Taylor.

236
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,557
(loud banging)

237
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:01,297
- You do not walk away from me.

238
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:06,730
- Listen man,

239
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:10,225
my dad will pay you, I swear.

240
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:13,185
He'll give you whatever you want,

241
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,515
however much you want.

242
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,266
(knife plunging)

243
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:29,627
- Do it.

244
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,326
Now.

245
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,931
This isn't up to you.

246
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,570
(boy sobbing)

247
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,060
(knife falling)

248
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,060
(high-intensity suspense music)

249
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,148
This whole night was for you.

250
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,745
I planned this for you,

251
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,519
and you turn your back on your family.

252
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,602
And for what?

253
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,427
I thought we were over this
rebellious teenager thing.

254
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,020
You do not get to decide who you are.

255
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,853
I do.

256
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:21,889
(Taylor mumbles)

257
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:22,722
What?

258
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,268
- I can do better, I'll do better.

259
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,351
- Then do it.

260
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:34,096
(high-intensity suspense music)

261
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,408
(phone vibrating)

262
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:50,627
(phone ringtone)

263
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,498
- [Teenage boy] Hey.

264
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:54,247
- Hey, do you guys wanna come over?

265
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:55,580
- Yeah, totally.

266
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,852
- My parents are gone.

267
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,142
(suspense music)

268
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,638
(screams)

269
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,783
- [Narrator] The last reported
Sunny killing was in 2015,

270
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:40,117
in the northern Iowa town of Bettendorf.

271
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:45,756
(mellow guitar music)

272
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:50,906
- Crazy thing is, they're still out there.

273
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:53,356
- Whatever. Just an urban
legend they tell kids,

274
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:55,666
so they don't do anything
crazy on April Fool's.

275
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,216
- No, my parents actually
told me it was real.

276
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,696
- If I was that guy, I
would just kill them all.

277
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:02,775
That's why you carry a gun on you, guys.

278
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:03,987
- Dude, what are you talking about?

279
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:05,078
You don't own a gun.

280
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:08,166
- Yeah, guns are super lame anyway.

281
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,746
- No, you're right, yeah.

282
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:10,914
Guns are lame.

283
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:14,907
Good thing though, I don't
need a gun to protect you.

284
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:15,740
- Ew, no.

285
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,867
- So, truth or dare guys?

286
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:21,167
- Whoa, can I go first,

287
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,000
can I go first?

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,948
- That's so lame.

289
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,338
- No, let's do it.

290
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:26,171
- Okay, I'll go first.

291
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,523
Taylor, truth or dare?

292
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:32,451
- Dare.

293
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,718
- I dare you to do seven
minutes of heaven with me.

294
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:40,610
- You don't have to do that.

295
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,693
- No, it's fine. I want to. This way.

296
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:45,528
- Okay.

297
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,182
(mellow music)

298
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:56,226
- Whoa, you're pretty aggressive.

299
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,598
You know I actually like
you, I'm not just trying to-

300
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:01,348
- Stop lying, okay? Just shut up.

301
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,691
- Sorry.

302
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,439
- It's okay.

303
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,939
- This game sucks.

304
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,452
(screaming)

305
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,066
- He's dead.

306
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,399
- That's not even funny.

307
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,732
- I think it is.

308
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:40,730
- This isn't cool man.

309
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,480
(suspense music)

310
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,279
He's dead.

311
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,178
He's really dead.

312
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:00,327
(loud bang)
Oh my God.

313
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:01,374
What's going on?

314
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,496
- (Blond guy) No idea.

315
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,237
Oh shit. Jessa?

316
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,096
Oh my God.

317
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:09,764
Dude, we've gotta fucking go, we gotta go.

318
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,556
Fuck. Shit. Dude.

319
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,856
We need to get the fuck outta here,

320
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:15,576
Taylor has lost her mind.

321
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:18,993
(suspense music growing)

322
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,235
What the fuck?

323
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,774
(knife plunging)

324
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,774
(blond guy screams)

325
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,266
- (Teenage boy) Come one Taylor,

326
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,099
you don't have to do this.

327
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,735
- I know, it's just so
much fucking fun, though.

328
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:42,735
It just sucks 'cause you are kinda cute.

329
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:45,796
I feel bad to you, you're like
the only cool one in your ...

330
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:47,805
- I'll still be the cool one.

331
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:49,284
- What if you joined us?

332
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:50,117
We're like a family.

333
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:53,586
People say it's a cult
but it's more of a family.

334
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:56,076
We could have so much fun together.

335
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:57,922
Plus, I know you like me.

336
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,085
- I do. I really do like you.

337
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,015
- I know you do.

338
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,625
- Taylor, we gotta go get the cops,

339
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,175
we can fix this, this will be fine.

340
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,265
- What a bummer.

341
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,965
(knife plunging multiple times)

342
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:14,197
(blood gushing)

343
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:16,947
(suspense music)

344
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:21,906
- Taylor, I told you,

345
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:23,764
strangle, don't stab.

346
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:25,015
You never listen.

347
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,906
- Stabbing is so much more fun, though.

348
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:30,277
- [Man] Looks like we are
gonna need a lot more bleach.

349
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:31,943
- I did good though, right?

350
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:35,535
- You did good, you're a real
part of the family now, honey.

351
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:36,645
- You know what?

352
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:38,524
Maybe we should do a family portrait.

353
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:39,357
- Let's.

354
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:45,766
(camera clicking)

355
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,516
(suspense music)
