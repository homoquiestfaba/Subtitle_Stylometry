1
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Okay, okay, I get the point.

2
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,200
Of course you get the point.

3
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Look. You got five hours.
Five hours. . .

4
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,500
. . .till the big race.

5
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,800
Get up. Get up.
Come on, sleepy. Get up.

6
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,400
I can't believe you're still asleep.
I'm more excited than you.

7
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,900
Okay, look.

8
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,800
What will the other drivers'
wives wear?

9
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
''Wives''? Did I hear ''wives''?

10
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I said wives. I got ahead of myself.

11
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,000
You said wives.

12
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,000
-It was a slip of the tongue.
-I lI ke that slip.

13
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
I lI ke that tongue too.

14
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,800
Alex, aren't you a little bit nervous?

15
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,400
No. I've seen it in advance.

16
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,900
Checkered flag.

17
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
Honeymoon in the Bahamas.

18
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,700
Listen, let's just take
one ''zoom'' at a time.

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
I'll win that race, honey.

20
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
No one can stop me.

21
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Gentlemen, don't touch a thing.
It's hot.

22
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,900
You're hot!

23
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,900
-Rock 'n' roll driving.
-It feels good.

24
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,200
If you'd hit the brakes sooner,
that wouldn't have happened.

25
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,200
You drive your typewriter,
I'll drive my car.

26
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Alex, it's a computer.
You are such an asshole. Computer!

27
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,900
Sorry.

28
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,700
I'll be all right.

29
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,700
God, I hope so, Alex.

30
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,300
Just do one thing.

31
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Nibble my ear.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,300
For luck.

33
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,300
Alex, this is a public place.

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
-I won't race unless you do it.
-You are nuts!

35
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,700
You're serious?

36
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
I love you.

37
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
-Are you happy?
-Delirious.

38
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,500
Come here, pal.

39
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
-I want you to meet some guys.
-I thought we had a deal.

40
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,100
You drive and I jive.

41
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,900
Any future planning must
include a little ass-kissing.

42
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,200
So pucker up, buttercup.

43
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,900
Did I oversell this kid, gentlemen?
I think not.

44
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,600
Not just the hottest
rookie on the circuit. . .

45
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,700
. . .he's photogenic, telegenic,
drug-free. . .

46
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,500
. . .and he's good to his mom.

47
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Is that a face that'll sell motor oil,
or what?

48
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Speaks English too. Say a few words
to the nice people.

49
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
Hello, son.
Champion Spark Plugs.

50
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,900
Nice to meet you, Mr. Plugs.

51
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,200
Will you excuse us?

52
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,100
Jimmy Connors' attitude.

53
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,800
All unauthorized personnel are warned
to stay clear of this area.

54
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
Okay, let's do it.

55
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Back it up.

56
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
More.

57
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,300
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,600
More. Hold it there.

59
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Go in.

60
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,700
More.

61
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,900
That's it.

62
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,000
Encoder's locked.

63
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,100
Power it up.

64
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
He's good.

65
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Medical units, stand by.
30 seconds to contact.

66
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Go! Go! Go!

67
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Twenty seconds.

68
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Fifteen.

69
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Ten.

70
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,600
Five...

71
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
. . .four. . .

72
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
... three... two...

73
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
...one.

74
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,100
We got him. Let's go.

75
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Take off the helmet
and open the suit!

76
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,800
Clear!

77
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,200
What the--?!

78
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
We're moving out.

79
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,900
What the hell's going on?!

80
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,000
There's 7 million bucks
worth of merchandise.

81
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,300
We won't stop till
we hit security.

82
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,400
Clear!

83
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,500
Oxygen!

84
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,800
I wouldn't dance to it,
but that's a pulse.

85
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,000
He'll survive. Good job, people.
Sedate him and wrap him up.

86
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,000
Contact, 200 meters.

87
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,000
This area should be clear.

88
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,500
I guess I didn't win, huh?

89
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,100
He still has brain function.
Clamp him. Get the lobotomizer.

90
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,800
Imagine the shit we'd get if
we delivered him lI ke this?

91
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Forty megawatts to
the frontal lobe.

92
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,800
-That'll burn him clean.
-Should quiet him too.

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What kind of hospital is this?

94
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,000
What the hell?

95
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
What kind of hospital is this?!

96
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,700
Weapons, high left.
Take them out.

97
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,200
In position.

98
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Hit them!

99
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
Get the meat.

100
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,400
Stunners only.

101
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,900
I don 't want him damaged.

102
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
Yo! Taxi!

103
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,600
Warren Street.

104
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm driving here alone
and I'm thinking:

105
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Get fare first.

106
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,600
Antique watch.

107
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,700
Here. Take it.

108
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,200
Just get out of here!

109
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,500
This neighborhood not good.

110
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Very competitive,
and difficult to sleep.

111
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
-Where are we?
-Where we are?

112
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,300
My fare is flying.

113
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,100
Bonejackers!

114
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I kill you!

115
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Hello! What the hell is this?!

116
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Get out of here! Vamoose! Beat it!

117
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,600
Jose, it's Alex Furlong.
Open the door!

118
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,900
Is Julie upstairs?
I got to see her.

119
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
Come on, Julie.

120
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,600
Julie, open up! It's me, Alex!

121
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Where's Julie?

122
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,300
-Who?
-Julie.

123
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,500
Julie Redlund! Who are you?

124
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,400
I live here. Who are you?
How did you get in here?

125
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,200
What's going on?

126
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Who are you people?
What are you doing here?

127
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,600
-Why are you here?
-Looking for Julie.

128
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,700
Goddamn it, where is she?!

129
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
Get out of my face!

130
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,500
Charles, wait! Julie Redlund?

131
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,100
We bought this place
from her years ago.

132
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,000
That's impossible.
I was with her here this morning.

133
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,900
-Oh, my God. He's a Freejack!
-A what?

134
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,500
We can't help you. Nobody can.
Get away, or I'll call Central.

135
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
Now move!

136
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,100
Move!

137
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
There is a Freejack at large
in the area.

138
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,000
If you see him,
report it immediately.

139
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,100
A reward is posted for his capture.

140
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,600
Penalties for harboring a Freejack
are extreme.

141
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,000
I hate being the messenger.

142
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,100
I've a feeling
the client's gonna be pissed.

143
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,700
Oh, you do?

144
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,900
How'd you lI ke to be
dead for a day and a half. . .

145
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,600
. . .and someone brought
you more bad news?

146
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,400
Patience is hard to advocate with
the delay delivering your new body.

147
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,200
But all of my people assure me
of a rapid recapture.

148
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,600
You failed!

149
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Sir, if I could point out. . .

150
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,200
. . .the Spiritual Switchboard can only
hold you for another 36 hours.

151
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
You should consider
an alternative body.

152
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
I don't want an alternative body.

153
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I want this one.

154
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,800
You are slipping, Victor.

155
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,400
You're contracted to deliver Furlong.

156
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,000
I see you, but I do not see him.

157
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Beautiful.

158
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,300
Fabergé.

159
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,800
No more excuses. Mac Corp. Security
will handle this from now on.

160
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,500
1 91 6.

161
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,100
Before the revolution.

162
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,500
There was no delivery,
there will be no payment.

163
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,600
Now, get out of my sight.

164
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Mr. Vacendak is leaving now.
He is no longer on this case.

165
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
Let me tell you something.

166
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,100
I said I'd deliver Furlong
and that's what I'll do.

167
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,900
Make any arrangements you lI ke.
But keep your people out of my way.

168
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,200
Why, Victor.
Who do you think you're talking to?

169
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,400
I know who I'm talking to, Mark.

170
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,200
An asshole.

171
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
Get out!

172
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,600
If you're a praying man, I'd start.

173
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,000
Sister--

174
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
Don't ''Sister'' me!
Get the hell up.

175
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
What are you and why are you here?

176
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't know what I am. . .

177
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,900
. . .or where.

178
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
Maybe I died.

179
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,800
What did they call me?

180
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,100
Pathetic?

181
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,900
A Freejack.

182
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Holy shit!

183
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,500
Got him. His image is
in the Central Data Bank.

184
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If he even walks past a vid-phone,
he's ours.

185
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,100
Retrieval costs 1 7 million.

186
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Think his body's worth it?

187
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,700
I'd sell him yours for half that.

188
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
Someone would.

189
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Few people knew the timing
of the retrieval convoy.

190
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I know anyone indulging
in commerce on the side?

191
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,200
I don't, but it's worth checking.

192
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,600
It sure is.

193
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,300
Step up.

194
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Come on, Victor.

195
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,400
1 -2-1 -3-2-7-5-1 -3-0-6.

196
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
I never have nor will. . .

197
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,100
. . .divulge information outside
of this organization.

198
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,000
Frankly, I'm surprised you'd
even test me.

199
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm not testing you.
I'm testing the machine.

200
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,100
It works.

201
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,600
Have the others tested.

202
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,500
Some rich son of a bitch dies. . .

203
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,500
. . .they save his mind
in a computer. . .

204
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,100
. . .they call
the Spiritual Switchboard.

205
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,100
There is nothing spiritual about that.

206
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,100
Sometimes I wonder if the good Lord
has forsaken us all. . .

207
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,000
. . .to be letting this kind
of shit go on.

208
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Then they transfer his mind. . .

209
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,500
. . .to your body.

210
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
That's his ticket to immortality.

211
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,200
A brain transplant?

212
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
A mind transplant.

213
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Electronically, your mind will be
utterly annihilated.

214
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,700
Sorry, she's not here.

215
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Julie Redlund.

216
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,700
-Nothing?
-No listing.

217
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,400
Maybe she moved out of town.

218
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
She may have married, have a new name.

219
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
She could be dead.

220
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,600
Brad Carter. Try that one.

221
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
He's in Sector 7.

222
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
You probably knew it as Park Slope.

223
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,700
If you think this neighborhood is
dangerous. . .

224
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,200
. . .you have a surprise coming.

225
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,900
Now, they're probably looking for you
by now, so you must go. Now.

226
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,200
This place is not safe for you,
or us if you're here.

227
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,900
Here's some food.
I keep it hidden.

228
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,900
-Be careful out there.
-I will.

229
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,900
Thank you, Sister.

230
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,000
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

231
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,800
He does.

232
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
Can you tell me
where I can find 2784?

233
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,200
Excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for 278--

234
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
Son of a bitch!

235
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I knew it!

236
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,400
Alex Furlong!

237
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I knew it! I always knew it!
Look at you!

238
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,400
As young and healthy
as the day you got into that car!

239
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,400
The bastards snatched you!

240
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
You got no idea the shit I got.

241
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,000
The insurance wouldn't pay.
They couldn't find the body.

242
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,700
-You had me insured?
-I have all my drivers insured.

243
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,500
It did no good with you.
I looked for pieces!

244
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,100
A nose, a finger, anything!

245
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,000
This ain't my pad.

246
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,900
Here you either hide what you got
or you lose it.

247
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,600
This is remarkable.
I've never seen a Freejack.

248
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,600
Heard about them, sure.

249
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,500
I figured out it probably
happened to you.

250
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,500
Seen them on the 2-D, sure.
But touch one?

251
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,100
One I know? One that's alive?
Remarkable.

252
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,400
How do you lI ke my antique ashtray?

253
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Porsche.

254
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,200
'67 Porsche.

255
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,900
You're Alex Furlong, all right.

256
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
What's that about?

257
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,200
The natives are restless.

258
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,000
-Why do they want me?
-Because you died.

259
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Spectacularly.

260
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,200
Incredible piece of videotape.
You should see it.

261
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,700
They know where and when you died,
so you're a candidate for retrieval.

262
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,200
Space-time coordinates.
It's still raw, but it'll be perfected.

263
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,900
I don't get it. Why not grab
someone who's alive now?

264
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,800
Look at these people. They've lived
their lives with no ozone layer.

265
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Sucking up megadoses of carbon
monoxide. . .

266
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,800
. . .sulfur dioxide, mercury, lead,
benzene. . .

267
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,400
. . .nuclear waste.

268
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,000
They're hooked on drugs not around
in the 20th century.

269
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Let's face it, you're a hot property.

270
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,800
Do you remember Julie Redlund?

271
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,500
Sure, I remember Julie Redlund.

272
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,800
What happened to her?

273
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,700
She lives in Battery Park.
Safe behind the palisades of power.

274
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,600
She's an exec at
the McCandless Corporation.

275
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,200
Only the biggest company in the world.
They own everything.

276
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,800
I must reach her. I must see her.

277
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,500
That is the truth.

278
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,700
You must reach her.

279
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
They're not going for it.

280
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We should try for the mineral rights.

281
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,100
Your try could kill the whole deal.

282
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,900
We're talking about 3 billion.
That's worth playing cards for.

283
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,400
Besides, I think they're
ready to fold.

284
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,900
I want it taken off the table.

285
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,300
Now.

286
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,400
Why don't they return to the table?

287
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,700
We will sign.
The mineral rights are yours.

288
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,800
Mr. McCandless is waiting
for your call.

289
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
You drive a hard bargain.

290
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,400
Pity we don't have more lI ke you.

291
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,600
Perhaps we would have
won the trade war.

292
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,800
Mr. McCandless is on line 17.

293
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
How'd it go?

294
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,600
Fun. I didn't make
friends, but I made a deal.

295
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,400
-Did we get exactly what we needed?
-And more.

296
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,700
That's good.

297
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,900
-Where are you?
-In Sydney.

298
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm near the opera
for when the fat lady sings.

299
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,700
Something's come up.
The East-Pac deal is unglued.

300
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,000
I need you in Tokyo tonight.

301
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
-Can you handle it?
-Is this a promotion?

302
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,200
We'll discuss it
when the deal's done.

303
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,600
Andressen will brief
you in-flight.

304
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,100
-When will you be back?
-Tomorrow evening.

305
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,000
Call me if there's a problem.
Or if there's no problem. Bye.

306
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,500
Pull your hat down.
You look too healthy.

307
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
-I'm walking.
-You're standing out.

308
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,900
The heat's on you. Slow down.
Walk with a limp.

309
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,800
Think sick.

310
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,700
That's better.

311
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
If you look lI ke poison,
no one will touch you.

312
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,800
You gotta look messed up.
LI ke me.

313
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,800
There you go. One blue plate special.

314
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
I waited 20 minutes for this shit?!

315
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,600
I'll take it back!

316
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,800
-Brad! What's up?
-What's special today?

317
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
You're looking at it.

318
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,800
-Let me speak to her.
-Let me handle this.

319
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,900
I gotta talk to her.

320
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
These things can see and hear you.

321
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Your voice over these lines,
you're done for.

322
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,800
Now trust me.

323
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,400
Go! !

324
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,500
You keep looking at me. . .

325
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,800
. . .you'll see me kill you.

326
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,800
Why is there a piece on the table?!

327
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,900
-Put that away.
-He started it.

328
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,400
Hey, you moron!
You messing with my boy here?

329
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Mind your own business.
You'll live longer.

330
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,900
A limo is coming.

331
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,200
In 5 minutes, from the outhouse
to the penthouse.

332
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,900
Is Julie coming?

333
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,200
I just talked to Julie's car.

334
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
Besides, keep it zipped.

335
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,800
The frigging word is out on you.

336
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,200
What am I swilling this puke for?
In 5 minutes, I'll be eating caviar.

337
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,900
You?

338
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,600
What?

339
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,400
You said you'll be eating caviar.
Not us.

340
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,300
Christ! You're acting lI ke
one of these paranoid creeps.

341
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,900
You called them, you bastard!

342
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,900
You turned me in!

343
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,700
-I'm the one who called!
-Let go, you prick!

344
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,600
He's my bone!

345
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
-What the fuck?
-Let go!

346
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,600
Let's get out of here!

347
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,600
Move, move, move!

348
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,800
Secure the door!

349
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,700
Give us a fucking break!

350
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Come on, start, you motherfucker.

351
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,700
Look out!

352
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,500
-Get out of my way!
-Get out of here!

353
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,300
Freejack approaching checkpoint
at high speed.

354
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
-Victor?
-What is it?

355
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,800
He crossed a checkpoint.
Heading toward Sector 9.

356
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,100
I know where he's going.

357
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,600
Don't be long, we're late.

358
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,200
-Be back in 20 minutes.
-Okay.

359
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,400
Door.

360
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
Hi, honey.

361
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,800
It's me, Alex.

362
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,500
Wait a second!

363
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,900
What's wrong?
Don't you remember me?!

364
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,200
You're a liar! Let go of me!

365
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,200
Who do you think I am?

366
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,100
You're not Alex Furlong!

367
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
You're the bastard who stole his body!

368
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,000
Damn it!
Stop and listen to me!

369
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,100
I'm Alex! I can prove it!

370
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,600
Look at me!

371
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,500
You gave this to me
before the race.

372
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,400
Don't you remember?!

373
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,900
That was yesterday.

374
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
What's happened to us?

375
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Go, go! Move, move, move!

376
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,400
-I escaped while they fought.
-Then you just found me?

377
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,500
Brad told me where you lived.

378
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,400
How'd you get in here?

379
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,000
Through the open door.

380
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,900
Panel.

381
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Security.

382
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,300
Central Locking reports
authorized personnel.

383
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,500
No unauthorized access.

384
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,200
You're lying.
There's no other explanation.

385
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,800
Your voice couldn't have
authorized access.

386
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Intruder.

387
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,400
What'd you do that for?

388
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,500
Whoever you are, you've got
30 seconds.

389
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,400
Attention, tenants.

390
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
You're wrong! Don't!

391
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Please remain calm.

392
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,000
All unlocked doors will be secured...

393
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,600
...in 15 seconds.

394
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,200
Stay clear of the elevators.
They've been co-opted by Security.

395
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,200
This is not a drill.

396
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,300
Please stay where you are until
the all-clear sounds.

397
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Three seconds.
Two, one.

398
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,400
Where's Furlong?

399
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Yo! Is this your truck?

400
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
-Company's.
-Not anymore.

401
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,000
Calling in all support vehicles.
All vehicles in on this now!

402
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,900
Hey, Furlong. It's Vacendak.
I hate to say this...

403
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,400
...but you're speeding.

404
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,800
Where we going?

405
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,400
-I hate the dark!
-Piss off!

406
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,900
You can't get rid of me that easily.

407
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,900
Where're you guys coming from?

408
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Mom told me never to pick up
hitchhI kers.

409
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,000
-No applause?
-Show's not over yet.

410
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,400
Box him in and run him down.
Be gentle.

411
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,500
I want him without a scratch.

412
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,600
You should stop. Imagine how upset
we'd both be if you were hurt.

413
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh, imagine.

414
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
Come on, Vacendak.
You couldn't catch a cold.

415
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,900
Or catch the clap in a whorehouse!

416
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,800
Holy shit!

417
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,100
How am I doing?

418
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Not bad.

419
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
The brake pedal's on the left.

420
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,600
Game's over, Furlong.

421
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
Don 't!

422
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Don't do it!

423
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,200
If you drink any of that, I'm out of a
job.

424
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,200
Lord, the strange things
that wash up on this dock.

425
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,400
I'm beat.

426
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,400
You think so?

427
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,800
-Pretty much.
-Then you're beat.

428
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,100
A man thinks he's beat, he's beat.

429
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,000
You want some of this?

430
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,400
-What is it?
-River rat.

431
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,800
How do you eat that?

432
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,500
First you must cut off the head
and the tail.

433
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,600
Then you gut it.

434
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,100
It's all a matter of the sauce.

435
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,100
You don't just plop down warm rodent
on a plate and say:

436
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,600
''Here's your river rat. Would you
lI ke white or red wine?''

437
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,600
Not that there's any wine
around here anyway.

438
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
No wine since the 1 0-year depression.

439
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,700
I can whip you up one.
This is good-eating rats.

440
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
If it's come to this. . .

441
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,900
. . .what's the point?

442
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,600
He riddles me! The ancient riddle!

443
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,300
What's the point?

444
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,700
Ever seen an eagle fly
home with dinner. . .

445
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,200
. . .for the missus and the babies?

446
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,500
He's flying against the wind. . .

447
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,700
. . .and he's flying in rain, and he's
flying through bullets!

448
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,900
Then at the moment he's about to get
back to his nest. . .

449
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,500
. . .he says:

450
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,600
''Oh, what the fuck. It's a drag being
an eagle! ''

451
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,900
And right then. . .

452
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,600
. . .two little X's come across
his eyes. . .

453
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,400
. . .lI ke in the old-fashioned
cartoons. . .

454
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,000
. . .and he goes plunging down. . .

455
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,400
. . .and down and down and blam!

456
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,100
It's just a splatter of feathers.

457
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,900
Then we don't have the national bird
of America no more.

458
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,200
Did you ever see that?

459
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,000
Me neither.

460
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,100
Eagles got too much self-respect.

461
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,300
How's yours?

462
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,500
I'm okay.

463
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,900
Then you too can fly. You can fly.

464
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,300
Maybe I can.

465
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,500
You ain't beat yet, Furlong.

466
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,200
Not by a long shot.

467
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,600
I know Alex.

468
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,600
I know what he's lI ke. I know where
he goes when he's upset!

469
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,000
You're not even sure he's Alex.

470
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,800
Vacendak was. And if it's not
Furlong, we won't find him.

471
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,500
-It's dangerous.
-That's why you're here.

472
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,400
Thanks a lot.

473
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,400
He's not here.

474
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,200
I don't know. Maybe it wasn't him.

475
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,900
It's me.

476
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,400
It's all right. I'm okay.

477
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,700
What are you doing here?

478
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,600
Slumming?

479
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,200
If I knew it was you,
I wouldn't have turned you away.

480
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,600
Why not?

481
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,800
It seems to be the way it is here.
Brad tried to cash in on me.

482
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,600
-Why shouldn't you get in on it?
-Listen to me.

483
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,200
Vacendak set us both up.

484
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,900
He learned my door code, opened up my
place and led you into a trap.

485
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,300
This guy's the best there is.

486
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,400
You here to help me?

487
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,800
Oh, my God!

488
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,900
Ten million bucks?

489
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,400
That's too much.
That's way too much.

490
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,200
Oh, I don't know. Not really.

491
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,900
You're definitely Alex Furlong.

492
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,700
Something's come up. I must see you.

493
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,200
You were clear
the last time we talked.

494
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,200
-What else is there to say?
-It's important.

495
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Okay. I've got some business at
the Revolution. Go there.

496
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,200
I'll see you there.

497
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,400
-You got something going with him?
-No.

498
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,800
-What's the hook?
-He knows about people on the run.

499
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,600
He helps them escape.

500
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,200
This place is on the fringe.
I keep a low profile, okay?

501
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,400
Come on, I'll find Morgan.
I'll meet you at the bar.

502
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,000
-Want a drink?
-Yeah. Why not?

503
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,900
Game over.
You lose. Please try again.

504
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,700
You got a name, sugar?

505
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,700
It's Alex.

506
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,900
Talk to Club Channel.
How do you lI ke it here?

507
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,400
I don't.

508
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,100
Everyone's chasing me.

509
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,100
Really? What do they want?

510
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,300
My body.

511
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,800
The self-absorbed type.

512
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,200
Do you know what you're into?

513
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,200
You'll be killed for
being with him!

514
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,200
It's Furlong, the Freejack!

515
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,800
Break this wide and patch it in.

516
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,400
-You left him alone?
-He's resourceful.

517
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,200
-So what do you do, Alex?
-I race cars.

518
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,800
I mean I used to.
I guess I'm between jobs.

519
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,700
Get him out of here.

520
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,400
-We got network.
-We have Freejack Alex Furlong.

521
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,200
-Do you know how much you're worth?
- 10 million.

522
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,800
It's gone up. 15 million to anyone
who brings you in.

523
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,000
Bring me in?

524
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,400
I know someone who 's trying.

525
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,000
Goes by the name of Vacendak.
I got a message for you.

526
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,400
Fuck you, asshole.

527
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,700
Nobody's bringing me in.

528
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,600
Is this a hangover
in the future?

529
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,500
I've hidden people,
but he's too hot. . .

530
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,400
. . .but he can't stay any place long.

531
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,100
Can't you help?

532
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,800
It's too big. Stop playing dumb,
you know what to do.

533
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,600
-Go to McCandless.
-I don't want him in this.

534
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,000
You have no choice.
He lI kes you. Go to him.

535
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,800
Explain the situation.
Be at his mercy.

536
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,600
Hi, how's Tokyo?

537
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,400
Something's come up.
I'm still in New York.

538
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,600
You're not in Tokyo?

539
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,600
No.

540
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,600
How long have you known Julie?

541
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,000
Couple of years.
Haven't seen much of her lately.

542
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,000
Why is that?

543
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,200
She's busy wheeling and dealing.

544
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,400
McCandless owns her.

545
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,100
She can't be owned by anyone.

546
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Listen, things have changed.

547
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,100
People are on the top or the bottom,
no one in between.

548
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,600
Julie is on the top.

549
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,900
He's a Freejack, and legally
someone else's property.

550
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,000
-You think that's right?
-He died, Jule.

551
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,400
Someone paid to bring him back.

552
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,000
He belongs to them.
Should they let him be killed?

553
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,000
Who's the client?

554
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Clients are guaranteed secrecy.

555
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,200
The Switchboard
is a McCandless division...

556
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,600
...even I'm not privy to its records.
Understand?

557
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I've gotta go now, I'm already late.

558
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
Where are you, Jule?

559
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,200
I'm at a friend's.

560
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,600
Is he with you?

561
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,400
No.

562
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,100
-I'll check into it.
-Thanks.

563
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,800
I won 't promise anything.
Legally I can 't interfere.

564
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,800
Why don 't you call in a few hours?
I'll see what I can do.

565
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,200
Thanks.

566
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Thanks, Mac.

567
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,800
All right, be very careful.

568
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,200
Bye.

569
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Morgan's gone.

570
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,400
Good.

571
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,800
Alex. . .

572
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
. . .I'm a lot older now.

573
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,400
No.

574
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
You're beautiful.

575
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,800
What's the matter?

576
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,000
I watched you die.

577
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,600
Furlong paid you a visit and you
gave him Brad's address.

578
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
And you haven't seen him since?

579
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,800
Are you lying, Sister?

580
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,500
The good Lord says
to turn the other cheek.

581
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,400
He never had to deal
with dickheads lI ke you.

582
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:00,000
Mac's arranged for a boat to dock
in an old recycling plant.

583
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,500
It's abandoned.
You shouldn't need that.

584
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,100
Hopefully.

585
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,500
I'm not coming with you, Alex.

586
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,600
I know.

587
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,800
I have a life here.
I can't walk away from it.

588
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,800
What about us?

589
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,400
''Us'' was 1 8 years ago.

590
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,200
It was two days for me.

591
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,600
Two days, Julie.

592
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,800
If I'd come to you
the day before your race. . .

593
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,300
. . .and said, ''I have to leave.

594
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,000
Come with me. ''
What would you've said?

595
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,300
I would have said no.

596
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,600
You take care.

597
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,400
I don't know. Remember the last time
you gave me this?

598
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,500
It's time, sir.

599
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,300
I'll be right out.

600
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,300
Well, it looks safe.

601
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,300
Every time I begin to feel safe,
something bad happens.

602
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,000
You do all right.

603
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,300
Your portrait's up in lights
all over town.

604
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,200
People see your face,
they know you've not been caught.

605
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,400
You're a hero.

606
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,000
Shit, I ain't no hero.
I'm just looking after my own ass.

607
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,800
You and I know that. But there's
8 million desperate people here.

608
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,800
My grandmother's one of them.

609
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,600
You keep making her happy,
and I'll stick with you.

610
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
Is that it?

611
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,100
I guess so.

612
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Where the hell is everybody?

613
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,600
You still feel safe?

614
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,500
You're not getting
on that boat, Furlong.

615
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,000
What the hell?

616
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,300
Get them!

617
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,900
Come on, move it! Move, move!

618
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,600
Shit!

619
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,300
Furlong's not there. Or in the car.

620
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,700
Then find him and kill him.

621
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,500
Vacendak's here
with his bonejackers.

622
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,400
Then kill them too.

623
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,200
Move it! Move!

624
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,400
Move! Move!

625
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,800
Move!

626
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,500
Ripper, who's using hard ammo?

627
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,300
Not bonejackers.
There's someone else.

628
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,300
-We're trapped!
-What do you mean ''we,'' white man?

629
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,200
Just kidding. I keep me covered.

630
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,000
There's no one below.

631
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,300
Grab some of this hardware
and get out.

632
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,100
They're coming,
and they don't want you alive.

633
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,400
If I run now, I'll be running forever.

634
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,800
I gotta find out who wants me.

635
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,800
Go. I'll see what I can do here.

636
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,900
I keep my grandma smiling.

637
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,400
I will.

638
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,500
You looking for this?

639
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,100
Freeze!

640
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,400
Do it!

641
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,800
Stunners only. He wants me
without a scratch.

642
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,900
Suck this, Vacendak!

643
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,900
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

644
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,700
I was aiming at you.
They were in the way.

645
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,400
Well, they're not now.

646
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,500
You're right.

647
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,900
Tell me who's behind all this.
Who told you I'd be here?

648
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,500
I'm sorry.

649
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,000
I can't tell you that.

650
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:27,100
Goddamn you, Vacendak!
All I'm asking for is a name!

651
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,600
Now who is it?
Who's doing this to me?

652
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,900
McCandless.

653
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,600
I saved your life.

654
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,000
And I gave you the name you wanted.

655
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,700
The name of lan McCandless.

656
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,600
Still, I'd hate you to think that
I don't value my life highly.

657
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,000
I'll give you a five-minute start.

658
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,400
One Mississippi. . .

659
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,600
. . .two Mississippi. . . .

660
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,700
Get in!

661
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,600
-You're driving?
-Hurry! They're close behind.

662
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,200
I thought you were dead!

663
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,600
-Where'd you get this?
-It's Vacendak's. I stole it.

664
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,500
-Sure your boss didn't give it to you?
-What?

665
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,800
McCandless is trying to kill me!

666
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,300
Your boss!
The man you've been calling!

667
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,400
-That's crazy!
-Vacendak told me!

668
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,200
-Then he's lying!
-Well, somebody is!

669
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,000
Pull in there.

670
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,600
Call him on this thing.

671
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,600
I tried to get Mac, he's not there.

672
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,500
Then you call the company.

673
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,600
You call whoever's in charge.

674
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,800
-Miss Redlund?
-Who's that?

675
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,700
Mark Michelette, V.P. of Mac Corp.

676
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,300
Is someone with you?

677
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,100
Mr. Furlong, what an
unexpected pleasure.

678
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,900
Listen, whoever you are.
I'm with Julie and I'm armed.

679
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:58,000
I see that. Stay calm, Julie.
We'll handle this.

680
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,900
Tell us your demands.

681
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,000
I want to talk to McCandless.

682
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,300
Mr. McCandless isn 't in.
He's expected shortly.

683
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:09,400
If you want to wait for him here,
I'll arrange entry.

684
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,100
You do that.

685
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,000
What's that?

686
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,000
I don't know.

687
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,200
It's a trace.

688
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,300
All right, I've got a fix on Furlong.

689
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,000
Where's he headed?

690
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,100
Right to the gates of hell. . .

691
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,000
. . .at Michelette's invitation.

692
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,500
They're in the elevator.

693
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,700
Put down the gun.

694
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,800
You can drop this absurd pantomime.

695
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,700
I watched the rest of the tape.
Most interesting.

696
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,600
Watch this bit. This is good.

697
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,100
How touching.

698
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,600
A woman in love.

699
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,300
There's not the least chance
you'd shoot her.

700
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,900
You'll be through when Mac gets back.

701
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,600
Mr. McCandless is in the next
office. Would you lI ke to see him?

702
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:56,000
A virus, strain three.
He's been dead almost three days now.

703
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,300
Mac didn't have much time
to organize this.

704
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,600
His mistake was
asking me to carry it out.

705
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,800
McCandless snatched you.
He needs your body quite badly.

706
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:11,700
He has an hour on the Switchboard
before his brain is irretrievable.

707
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,100
How do you suppose
you'll deliver me to him?

708
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,600
I have no intention
of delivering you to him.

709
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,600
Nobody's being delivered
to McCandless.

710
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,500
The time has come for change.

711
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,000
I'm taking over the company.

712
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,700
I have nothing against you.

713
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,600
I did organize the rocket attack.

714
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,300
I sent guns to the waterfront. . .

715
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,000
. . .to stop Mac
from getting his new body.

716
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,800
Nothing personal.

717
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,600
In a short time, McCandless' brain
will be electronic rubbish.

718
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,200
I'll be president of the company,
and you two. . . .

719
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,400
You two can do
whatever takes your fancy.

720
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,200
Ms. Redlund. . .

721
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,600
. . .your services are
no longer required.

722
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,000
They're on their way.

723
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,000
I kill them both.

724
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,700
This is too easy.

725
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,400
Think he'd just let us walk out?

726
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,400
I don't.

727
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,200
Ready!

728
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,800
Is there another way out?

729
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,300
There's a back way.

730
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,600
One shot.

731
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,400
Think they'll stand in line?

732
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,700
Aim.

733
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,000
Welcome to the lobby.

734
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,300
Have a nice day.

735
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,300
Hold it!

736
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,500
Fire!

737
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,900
Julie, you okay?

738
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,800
-Why the 1 00th floor?
-There's an escape module.

739
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:05,400
Michelette's private bodyguard.

740
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,100
Michelette.

741
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,500
Secure the building.
Find him and hold him for me.

742
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,600
You wanted a fucking palace revoIt?

743
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,500
Well, you got one!

744
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,100
It's not stopping.

745
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's not stopping!

746
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,900
-Any other way to controI it?
-This is it.

747
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,500
200. They're headed
for the Switchboard.

748
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,000
Mac's got them now.

749
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,200
We're going to the top.

750
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,600
Welcome to my mind.

751
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,800
You've been behind it all.

752
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,700
I never meant to harm anyone,
least of all you.

753
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,400
You weren't meant to see any of this.

754
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,100
It's why I wanted you
to take the trip to Tokyo.

755
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,200
By the time you returned,
all this would've been over.

756
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,000
I spoke to you in Australia.
You were alive.

757
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,500
I'm sorry, Jule.

758
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,500
Sorry to deceive you.

759
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,800
Mr. Furlong, believe me,
I never meant you any harm either.

760
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
We took you out a moment
before your death.

761
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,400
The process did not shorten
your natural life.

762
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,700
What about trying to shorten my
unnatural life?

763
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Didn't start out that way.

764
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,900
I was assured all would go smoothly.

765
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,800
You were never supposed to wake up.

766
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,000
So you see, once the consciousness
transfer was complete. . .

767
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,900
. . .a fait accompli, only then would
I have shown you my new self.

768
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,000
Why do it at all?

769
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,600
Because I love you.

770
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,000
I've loved you for years,
since we first met.

771
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:13,000
But it was clear that nothing I
possessed, no power or wealth. . .

772
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,600
. . .nothing could make you feel
what I felt.

773
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,600
I held out hope
that with enough time. . .

774
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,900
. . .I could reach your heart.

775
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,900
But time ran out. I became ill.

776
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,000
I was dying.

777
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:34,300
You spoke of Mr. Furlong and
how much you loved him years ago.

778
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,500
If only I could become this man. . .

779
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
. . .whom you loved so much. . . .

780
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,000
If I could somehow. . .

781
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,400
. . .physically become him. . . .

782
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,900
Of course, I was mad.

783
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,500
I was quite mad.

784
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,100
I beg you both to forgive me.

785
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,800
Vacendak, it's Mac. Listen carefully.

786
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,200
I'm calling it off, the whole thing.
Everything.

787
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,700
Say that again.

788
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:06,400
Cease all pursuit of Furlong.
You will be paid in full.

789
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,400
Procedure 21 7, as discussed.

790
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:15,800
I tried to steal love from you,
love I was unable to win.

791
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,600
Worse, I've tried
to cheat life itself. . .

792
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,300
. . .by seizing years not granted me.

793
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:25,400
For these crimes,
I sentence myself to death.

794
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,600
Documents have been prepared.

795
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,300
My termination here. . .

796
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,700
. . .will be as if the actual
consciousness transfer was made.

797
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,500
In other words. . .

798
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,000
. . .you will be me.

799
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,700
Don't be alarmed.

800
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:47,400
A little play-acting will be required.
Julie will help.

801
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,700
I'd be you?

802
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,500
We could do it.

803
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,000
We could pull it off.
You and me, together.

804
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,300
Stranger things have happened.

805
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:06,100
Just think of it. You'll have
all my money and power.

806
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,600
Let's hope you use them
more wisely than I.

807
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,400
Before you is a sequence of numbers.

808
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,300
Let's get on with it.

809
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,100
Start with the first number. . .

810
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,000
. . .key in the sequence,
then hit delete.

811
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,600
The sequence is in.

812
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,300
Then hit delete, Mr. Furlong.

813
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,100
Strange.

814
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,400
I'm still here.

815
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,600
You must have missed one.

816
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,500
Do it again.

817
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,600
You're stalling.

818
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,900
What kept you? I've been humoring
him for 5 minutes.

819
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,700
I was a bit busy.

820
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,000
I almost had Michelette,
but he's still missing.

821
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,200
Let him go!

822
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,700
Sorry, Jule.

823
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,200
-It's either him or me.
-Too bad.

824
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,800
I was just getting used to you.

825
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,700
You don't make many friends
in this business.

826
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,400
Who says we're friends?

827
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,700
Well, Vacendak?

828
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,200
Shall we?

829
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,200
Shall we make the switch?

830
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,600
Just let it happen, Mr. Furlong.

831
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,300
Just go with it.

832
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,000
You need a new soul, not a new body.

833
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,300
No machine can give you that.

834
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,200
Don't resist.

835
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,700
The computer is powerful.

836
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,000
You can fight it, Alex.

837
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:55,900
Your mind will be utterly
annihilated.

838
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,600
You can 't help yourself.

839
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,300
Nobody can.

840
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
You've completely lost it.

841
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,900
He set me up!

842
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,900
Don 't do it!

843
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,600
Excellent shot, Mrs. Redlund.

844
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,700
You just made me head of Mac Corp.
Remind me to change the name.

845
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,400
Put the gun down, Vacendak.

846
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,200
I controI the company, the city,
the banks, everything.

847
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,000
You're no longer needed, asshole.

848
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,200
McCandless is no more.

849
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,400
Wait. . .

850
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,000
. . .I'm McCandless.

851
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,800
Nice try, Mark, but I made it.

852
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,800
-I completed the transfer.
-Don't you give me that shit.

853
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Shoot him, Vacendak.
He tried to assassinate me.

854
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,600
You take orders from a Freejack?

855
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,000
Who is he?

856
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,800
There were 22.762 seconds of transfer
before it blew off-line.

857
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,400
-Is he McCandless?
-Of course I am.

858
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,200
We've completed transfers
in that time. . .

859
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,200
. . .and we've had
them take longer.

860
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,000
I don't know.

861
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,000
Mr. McCandless will have to
identify himself.

862
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,800
We can't get a voice-print lock.
A ret scan won't work.

863
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:08,500
He is lying!
Check his personal I.D. number!

864
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,600
Only McCandless would know that!

865
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,200
Well?

866
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,500
What more do you want?
Shoot him, Vacendak!

867
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,800
Six.

868
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,300
Correct.

869
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Continue.

870
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,100
Nine.

871
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,300
Proceed.

872
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,600
Two.

873
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,500
Seven.

874
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,700
Five, seven.

875
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:11,000
Five, four, six, nine, seven!

876
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,800
Goddamn you, McCandless!

877
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,300
Nice to have you back.

878
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,800
Nice to be back.

879
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,800
Remarkable.
I feel good.

880
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,900
Gentlemen, prepare my car.

881
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,800
You'll be dressed in something more
appropriate, then. . .

882
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,700
. . .you'll come with me.

883
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:02,600
-I'll be driving today.
-Very well, sir.

884
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,400
I knew you'd make a mistake.

885
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,800
McCandless can't drive.

886
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:10,800
You must coach him better than that.

887
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,400
Is that you?

888
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,800
Nibble my ear. . .

889
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,600
. . .for luck.

890
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,300
How'd you get the I.D. number right?

891
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,800
He didn't.

892
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,500
I lied.

893
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,300
He wasn't even close.

894
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,600
Are we really going to do this?

895
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,800
Stranger things have happened.
Buckle up.

896
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,800
Let's see what this baby can do.

897
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:43,600
