the insurance company

125

( applause )
thank you.

139
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,562
My disease
had left me in a...

140
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,631
In a drug-induced sleep.

141
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,767
It was rough,

142
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,503
But even then I had a dream.

143
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,905
Just like this guy.

144
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,640
Just like old marty king.

145
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,509
I had a dream.
( chuckles )

146
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,146
My slavery
was not picking cotton

147
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,047
Or eating gumbo
or whatever,

148
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,050
But it was gin
and it was cocaine,

149
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,521
And I have been released.

150
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:06,191

00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,530

153
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,065

154
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,534

Bruce: There they are!

157
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,979

158
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,648

159
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,849
Mwah.

160
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,117
You look so great today.

161
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,819
There's my leading man!

162
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,988
Say something, frankie!
Would you not do that, please?

163
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,124
Oh, I'm sorry.

164
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,493
I've been waiting three months
to get this puppy back
in my hands.

165
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,496
Bruce put his
directing career on hold
while he was getting better.

166
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,897
They don't allow
cameras in rehab.

is that really jack knoll?

168
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,034
Bruce ( whispering )
oh, yeah, I never told you.

169
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,569
Jack! Jack,
come over and meet my family.

170
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,704
Two seconds!

171
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,639
( whispering ) we might be
doing a picture together.

172
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,941
With you directing?
Uh-huh.

173
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,176
Oh, did you hear that?
Oh, my god!

174
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,812
When did you become
a director, bruce?

175
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,715
Dude, I've been directing
my whole life.

176
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,218
Don't you remember
all those funny movies you used
to make when you were boys?

177
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,821
He tortured him.
Bruce tortured him on film.

178
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,224
That's not true.

179
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,928
( chuckles )
it's good to see you.

180
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,931
I haven't seen you--
I haven't seen you
since the wedding.

181
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,933
Right?
Yep.

182
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,902
You're not still mad
about that, are you?

183
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,873
Let's just
forget about it, bruce.
Right.

184
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,008
You don't wanna talk about it?
No, not really.

185
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,277
It's just that I kinda
wanted to talk about it.

186
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,146
Do you think it would be okay
just to keep this about now?
That's not a problem.

187
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:39,217
Jack knoll. Isn't he that
actor with all those guns?
Didn't he shoot somebody?

188
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,221
Hey! Bruce, your old man's
fuckin' gossipin' about me,
man.

189
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,223
I'm just kidding, man.
I'm just kidding. I'm jack.

190
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,825
I love you people.

191
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,693
I just grazed him,
didn't really hurt him.

192
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,097
Listen, your son,
this man here...

193
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,698
Saved my life.

194
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,600
If it hadn't been for him,

195
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:59,271
I would've just ripped my skull,
right from above my eyebrows,

196
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,173
Just ripped it off
and taken my brains
and smashed them out.

197
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,742
This man is a saint.

198
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,310
Those are sweet words.
Thank you, jack.

199
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,245
Bruce,
are these your parents?

200
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,847
Oh, yes. Um...

201
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,316
You must be so proud.

202
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,084
Dharma,
this is my family.

203
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,819
Are you in show business?

204
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,588
Mom, this's dharma d-cup.

205
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,124
She's been in like
a billion porn movies.

206
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,293
Karen: Really?
Yeah, but I'm done
with all that.

207
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,629
I'm gonna try
and get into real acting.

208
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,231
I'm sure you'll be great.

209
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,666
Thanks.

210
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,901
You're a terrific actor.

211
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,570
What?

212
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:35,106
You...
You have a talent.

213
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,976
You...
The way you played
that comedy.

214
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,712
It's so rare,
so special.

215
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,980
You're a great actor.
Thank you.

216
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,915
What is he talking about?

217
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,117
Your short.
Your short, man. Super.

218
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,254
What--what short?
My short.

219
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,658
The short that I shot
at ucla film school, bro.
Remember?

220
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,994
About the wedding.

221
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,863
Right. You showed them
my wedding video?

222
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,700
You know what?
It's not actually called
"my wedding video" anymore.

223
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,636
It's called
"the wedding video"
for copyright reasons.

224
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,076
Frank. Frank!

225
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,844
Frank, they didn't
know it was real!

226
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,913
They thought that
you were actor!

227
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,616
And come on, it's not
like a million people
haven't seen it already!

228
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:22,887
It wasn't a million people,
bruce! It was 18 million people!

229
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,890
Okay, I shouldn't
have shown it to jack
without asking you first.

230
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,292
Oh, you think?

231
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,027
And I shouldn't have
put it on the internet.

232
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,228
That was a mistake.

233
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,163
Okay, frank, I'm sorry!

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,767
Did you just say
you were sorry?

235
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,169
I shouldn't have put
your wedding tape
on the internet.

236
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,172
I regret it.
It was a long time ago.

237
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,775
I've been a shitty brother,
but I'm a different person now.

238
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,010
I'm sober...

239
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,013
And I would like us
to start again.

240
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,051
( sighs )

241
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,920
All right, fine.

242
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,190
I'm gonna cook you breakfast
before you go tomorrow.

243
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,659
See ya tomorrow.

244
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,429
I love you, frank!

245
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,765
( horn honks )

246
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,900
Hey! Watch it!

247
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,003
( both groan )

248
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,205
Why aren't you in a car?

249
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,807
What?

250
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,078
This is l.A.
Nobody walks here.

251
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,815
Take a little bit of advice
and learn the lay of the land,
flatfoot.

252
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,918
Yeah, well,
let me give you some advice.
There's a rehab back there.

253
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,187
Are you trying to say
I'm an alcoholic?!

254
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,757
Because that is ridiculous!

255
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,428
Alcoholics don't even
ride bicycles, buddy!

256
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,164
They drive in a car!

257
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,233
So you are that!
You are an alcoholic!

258
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,436
( groans )

259
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,912
Lady, are you--are you okay?

260
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,450
Hey.

261
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,955
Great.

262
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,998
Lady...

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Lady.

264
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,804
( sighs )

265
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,081
( inhales deeply )

266
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,031
( horn honks )
oh, fuck!

267
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,299
Where am I?

268
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,536
( sighs )
in a parking lot.

269
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,171
Why am I in a parking lot?

270
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,240
You passed out.

271
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,210
So you stayed with me?

272
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,179
Yeah.

273
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:05,049
Okay, tell me where you live
and I'll take you home.

274
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,185
( crying )

275
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:11,055
I don't know
where I live anymore.

276
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:15,426
I went home today and my--
my fiancé...

277
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,428
I dressed like this
to surprise him.

278
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,431
And then I get home
and he was there...

279
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,901
And he was playing tag.

280
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,569
Tag?

281
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,305
Naked tag...

282
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,340
With the guy
who cleans the pool.

283
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,143
The pool boy, I guess.

284
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,847
And he's like, "babe,
what do you mean you haven't
heard of naked tag before?

285
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,148
You haven't heard of it?"

286
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,818
I'm like,
"no, I haven't heard of it,

287
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,487
"because it's not even a game,
and I'm not an idiot,

288
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,222
So stop saying
that it's a game."

289
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,324
He's like,
"babe, I have an erection,

290
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,594
But it's only because
I'm super competitive!"

291
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,931
And I'm like,
"who's competitive in tag?!"

292
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,934
Have you even
ever heard of anybody
that's competitive in tag?!

293
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:58,203
No, because it's a game that
you play with your friends!

294
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,905
It's a friendly game!

295
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,241
It's usually
pretty friendly.

296
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:08,246
He gets me drunk
and then he sits me down
and he just tells me...

297
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,115
Everything.

298
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,619
I'm sorry. God.

299
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,955
I have no idea why
I'm laying all of this on you.

300
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,957
I don't even know you.
I'm really sorry.

301
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,226
No, it's okay.

302
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,527
Really.

303
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,963
( sniffles )

304
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,065
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,270
Um... ( sighs)

306
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,073
( sniffles )

307
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,507
I don't know
what your plans are,

308
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,610
But do you maybe wanna
like go somewhere?

309
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,012
( sighs )

310
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,515
Yeah, you know,
let's go somewhere.

311
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,117
( sniffles )

312
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,120
Sure.

313
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,421
Okay.

314
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,023
( car starts )
great.

315
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,658
( crying )

316
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,226
Would you mind putting
your seat belt on?

317
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,427
It doesn't matter!

318
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,162
It doesn't
matter if I live or die!

319
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,964
Okay.

320
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,942
( whispering )
oh, wait, no. Wait, wait.

321
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,077
My parents
are asleep in there.

322
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,280
There's a--
there's a place in back.

323
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,943
Oh, shit. That's actually
my brother's stuff.

324
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,525
( sighs )

325
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,527
I made this
when I was a kid.

326
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,530
Cool.

327
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,999
So you don't live here?

328
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,002
No. No, um...

329
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,405
I actually live
in death valley.

330
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,008
What do you do in death valley?

331
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,478
I've just been
kind of camping out
and trying to write this novel.

332
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,983
Okay.
Is this all right?

333
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,184
Um...

334
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,552
Yeah, sure.

335
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,489
So what do you write about?

336
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,690
Um...

337
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,193
Revenge, mostly.

338
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,695
Wait, what is your name?

339
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,430
( chuckles )
frank.

340
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,432
Frank, I'm lassie.

341
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,101
Hi.
Hi.

342
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,169
So, frank,
I was just wondering

343
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:50,274
If perhaps
you could just want me...
Tonight.

344
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,711
You can do, honestly,
whatever you want to me.

345
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,580
Like really
pretty much anything.

346
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,583
Okay, uh, lassie...
Uh-huh.

347
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:02,020
Could we maybe kiss first?

348
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,556
Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,091
Okay.

350
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,078
What's the matter?
What? What?

351
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,348
You're not hard. What's wrong?
Am I doing something wrong?

352
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,216
No, we--we just started.

353
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,751
Right, but I mean...

354
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,487
Actually, lassie,
you're kind of squeezing.

355
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,323
I am? Sorry.

356
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,325
Is that better?

357
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,728
Uh, I mean,
you're still squeezing.

358
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,196
Really? Fuck.

359
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,597
Okay, how about that?

360
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,466
Um, that's a little better.

361
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,734
Yeah?

362
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,071
Oh, my god.
You can eat my bra.

363
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,605
I'm not just saying that.
It's edible.

364
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,340
I got it at a sex shop.

365
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,076
It's not toxic.
It's a turn-on.

366
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,345
Lassie, I think
I'm okay for now.

367
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,515
Um, maybe later.

368
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,250
I'll just...
I'll keep it on.

369
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,518
So, yeah.

370
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,590
But you're gonna like--

371
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,794
You will eventually get hard
tonight, right?

372
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,797
I'm just asking.
It'll happen?

373
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,800
It's never been
a problem before.

374
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,803
I think--
I think we'll be fine.

375
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,438
Great.

376
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,791
( sighs )

377
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,795
I'm sorry that I'm crying.
It's stupid.

378
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,763
You must feel like
enough of a failure.

379
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,232
( sniffles )

380
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,505
Which you shouldn't.

381
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,508
Lots of guys
can't get erections sometimes.

382
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,478
God damn it!
I just don't understand
why I'm taking care of you!

383
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,147
Because you know what?

384
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,315
This is actually a really
fucking horrible time

385
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,184
For this
to be happening to me!

386
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,186
I just don't--
I don't understand it!

387
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:19,524
I don't understand
why nobody will fuck me!

388
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,791
Shh!

389
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,331
Your parents.
Right, I'm sorry. Fuck.

390
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,200
( sniffles )

391
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,202
Thank you.

392
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,537
( sighs )

393
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,475
Fucking hell.

394
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:41,445
I should just go.
So I'll--I'll go.

395
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:46,484
You don't have to go.

396
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,419
Really, you don't have to go.

397
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,354
All right.

398
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,973
Okay, I literally
never talk about this.

399
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,780
I found out my fiancée
was cheating at our wedding.

400
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,349
Really?

401
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:24,622
We were only getting married
because she was pregnant.

402
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,758
Turns out it wasn't my kid.

403
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,894
Wow.

404
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,495
My best man.

405
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,297
No way.

406
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,401
What'd you do?

407
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,573
I hit her in the face.

408
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,711
( chuckles )
what? Sorry.

409
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:50,715
It wasn't really a hit.
It was more like a slap.

410
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,317
( sighs )

411
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,588
And then I pulled
her hair a little.

412
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,325
And then I got
an upset stomach and I...

413
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,996
I threw up on her.

414
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,597
It was fucking terrible.

415
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,466
I knew...

416
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,002
I knew that I knew you
from somewhere!

417
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,005
I saw that video!
I saw your wedding video
on the internet!

418
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,274
Yeah, well,
a lot of people did.

419
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,675
Why did you put that
on the internet?!

420
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,412
I didn't.
My brother did.

421
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,682
It's so weird.
My friends used to watch
that video all the time.

422
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:28,586
They thought it was like
the funniest shit ever.

423
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,855
Yeah.

424
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,957
I never did, though.

425
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,295
I thought that
it was just sad.

426
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,966
Like watching someone
get their heart stepped on
right in front of you.

427
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,768
Or something.

428
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,972
Well, you're like the only
person who ever saw that.

429
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,511
( sniffles )

430
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,017
You still hate her? The girl.

431
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,587
No.

432
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,589
Yeah.

433
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,459
She sounds
exactly like peter.

434
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:12,396
Just a lying, cheating,
whore bitch.

435
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,533
My god.

436
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,068
Go on.

437
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,404
No, I just think that
that's really selfish

438
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:25,643
And cruel and evil
and whore-like.

439
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:29,547
Okay, one more time. Slow.

440
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,884
Oh, okay. Um, okay.

441
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,689
She was--
what was her name?

442
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,091
Sandra.

443
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,361
Sandra is a fucking...

444
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,031
Horrible...

445
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,901
Cunt-face...

446
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,138
Bitch.

447
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,608
And she fucked you up.

448
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,813
She fucked you up
and she sent you
to death valley to die.

449
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,723
Holy shit! Holy shit!

450
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,725
Okay, now stop talking!
I can't believe it!

451
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,527
Stop talking!
I can't believe it!

452
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,464
( birds chirping )

453
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,868
( grunts )

454
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,804
( sighs )

455
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,086
( chuckles )

456
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,894
Morning, mom.

457
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,495
Morning, horn-dog.

458
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,031
I saw your
lady friend leaving.

459
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,067
I'm gonna take a shower.

460
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,841
Oh. Hey, bro.
Hey. Sorry.

461
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,943
I didn't know
you had company.

462
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,612
Oh, no, that's okay.
You remember claudia,
right? My editor.

463
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,482
Oh, we weren't--
we're just friends.

464
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,485
I mean, she'll come over
and let me eat her out
sometimes,

465
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:15,786
But it's not serious.

466
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,721
Hi, frank.

467
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:20,658
Oh, wait.
Bro, I wanted to talk to you.

468
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,930
Um, I wanted you to know that
I filmed you and that chick
last night.

469
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,065
And I am glad that I did.

470
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,733
When she hit you
with her bike--

471
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,736
It was awesome.
Bang! Fuckin' love happens.

472
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,072
Italian vibe.
Let's see what happens next.

473
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,707
Like very early cassavetes.

474
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,843
But I heard you loud
and clear last night

475
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:42,012
When you talked about
wanting to be in the loop
and all that shit.

476
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:46,050
And here's the deal:
I dropped a copy of what
I filmed off at jack's.

477
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,852
Good for you, baby.
All right, get it back.

478
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,687
He asked me to be honest,
and I've just been honest.

479
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,255
It's pathetic.
Bruce...

480
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,991
Oh, shit!
Let me handle this.

481
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,126
What?
Bro...

482
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,995
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,867
Okay, I didn't film you two
having the sex,

484
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,635
If that's what
you're worried about it.

485
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,737
I mean I watched it.
But I didn't film it.

486
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,774
Okay. Bruce, you're gonna
give me the address,

487
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,143
And I am gonna go pick up
whatever it is you gave him.

488
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,779
Why are you being like this?
We just had a beautiful moment.

489
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,115
We had another
beautiful moment--
give me the fucking address!

490
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,717
Boys, stop fighting!

491
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,719
I finally get my life in order!

492
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,522
I finally find someone
in the business
who believes in me!

493
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,525
And I ask my baby brother
for one little favor

494
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,293
To help me achieve my dream,
and will he help?

495
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,629
How is jack knoll
seeing a movie

496
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:35,633
Of a drunken woman
hitting me with her bike helping
you get your dream, bruce?!

497
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,535
Stop fighting!

498
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:40,137
Because it's funny, man!
It's fuckin' funny!

499
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,206
Not as funny as the stuff
in the clubhouse.

500
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,012
What did you say?
Nothing.

501
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,881
Bro, you just swore to me
that you didn't film me
in the clubhouse.

502
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,285
No, I did not. I swore that
I didn't film you having sex.

503
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,786
And that was true.

504
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:58,923
But we had sex
in the clubhouse!

505
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,926
We had sex almost immediately
in the clubhouse.

506
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:04,295
I mean, that's what
we did in the clubhouse.

507
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:07,765
That depends how
you define sex.
( chuckles )

508
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,769
Personally, I think that sex
involves one of the people
having an erection.

509
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,971
Yeah, that's usually the case.
Will you shut up?!

510
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:18,108
I'm just saying, it took quite
a while for that to occur.

511
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,978
But when you finally,
finally did achieve
that erection--

512
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,848
And good for you, bro--
but when you did, I cut.

513
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,117
Because, as far
as I'm concerned,
sex is a private thing,

514
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,588
A sacred thing
between two people,
even if it takes a while.

515
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,089
Bruce, bruce--
listen to my rationale.

516
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,993
How many movies
have sex in them?

517
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,227
All of them.

518
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,129
How many movies
have impotence?

519
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,331
None of them.

520
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,100
Impotence makes us pop.

521
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,902
Am I wrong?

522
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,606
Wow, wow, wow,
you just hate that I'm making

523
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,007
Something of my life,
don't you?

524
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,009
You just hate the fact
that I'm a director now.

525
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,877
No, I don't.
You know why?

526
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,879
Because you're
not a director!

527
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:58,916
You're a fucking pervert
and a freak!

528
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:03,921
Well, listen to this:
Action! Cut! Action! Cut!

529
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,991
Fucking action!

530
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:10,995
That's directing, my friend.

531
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,731
Come on, man, just let him
watch it once.

532
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:17,001
Did it even occur to you
there's another person
in your stupid film?

533
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,169
I mean, did you even
think about that?

534
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,639
Mr. Knoll!

535
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,075
Jack!

536
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,678
Jack?

537
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,682
You're just gonna walk in?

538
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,018
Jack?

539
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,955
Hello?

540
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:41,025
( oinking )

541
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,832
Bruce: Buddy?

542
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,173
Is this his house?

543
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,442
He must be redecorating.

544
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:01,945
Jackie boy!

545
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,784
Hey, man!

546
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,786
Hey! Almost done!

547
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:12,723
What's up?
You look amazing!

548
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,225
Where's all your stuff, bro?
Collection agency.

549
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,062
Said they're coming
for my treadmill this morning.

550
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,064
Let 'em try.
Let 'em try!

551
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,331
He's got a gun.
He has a gun.

552
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,833
That's a gun.
He's virile.

553
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,435
Mr. Knoll...
Call me jack, son!

554
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,936
How's my form?!

555
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,272
Uh, pretty good.

556
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:32,242
So my brother
dropped off a dvd--
haven't seen it yet!

557
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:35,813
I thought you said that
you were gonna watch it
before your agent came over.

558
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,081
Agent dropped me as a client!

559
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,016
Said no one'll hire me!
Fuck him!

560
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,250
I should've fired him
years ago!

561
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,486
Got me up for grandpa roles now!

562
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,355
Come here! Look at this!
Come here!

563
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,857
Hit my ass!

564
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,992
Frank, hit it!
Really hit it! Hit my ass!

565
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,394
I'm not hitting his ass.
Punch his fucking ass.

566
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,162
Come on! Hit it hard!

567
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,366
Yah! Damn right!
Does that feel like
a grandpa ass to you?

568
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,102
Not at all.
No.

569
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,971
That ass is harder
than a dick on viagra!

570
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:04,141
But no, I got an agent who says,
"take the grandpa roles.
They die in the end."

571
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,744
He's a lunatic.
He has a gun.

572
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,113
We're gonna get the dvd
and get the fuck out of here.

573
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,749
Bruce, we gotta do movies
where there's lots of fucking!

574
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,284
Don't worry, I can see it
in your eyes, I'm fine.

575
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,320
Watch this, motherfuckers!

576
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,922
Where's my addiction, bruce?!
Way back there, jack!

577
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,257
Can you see it, bruce?!

578
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,892
Fucking way over there!

579
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,328
Fuck you, addiction!
You cannot catch me!

580
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,929
I win! I win!

581
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,898
You win!
I win!

582
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,902
Come on!
Let's watch your movie!

583
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,137
Action!

584
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,805
<i>Hey! Watch it!</i>

585
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,440
<i>( both groan )</i>

586
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,476
Make him turn it off!
I can't. He's enjoying it.

587
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,081
Jack: Frank, you got talent!

588
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,415
He said you're talented.

589
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,050
Isn't the camera work good?

590
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,219
Oh!
Frank?

591
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,224
Hey.
Jack: What are you doing?

592
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,960
Oh, shit! Get out!

593
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,897
What the fuck was that?

594
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,431
You didn't see that spark?
What?!

595
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,900
What are you doing here?

596
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,201
That'll dry right out.

597
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,936
What are you doing here?

598
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:08,071
Frank...

599
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,240
You know my daughter?
She's your daughter?

600
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,442
Dad, could you maybe
put some clothes on? Maybe?

601
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,311
This is your dad?
Yeah.

602
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,247
Oh. Hi.

603
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,515
How do you know my lassie?

604
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,117
I... I...
Rehab.

605
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,219
From rehab, last night.
I was late.

606
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,987
I was on my way to see you.
Yep. Exactly.

607
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,389
And I ran into him.
Exactly.

608
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,857
How do you know my father?

609
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,060
My brother was his roommate.

610
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,329
Hey. In rehab.
Brother?

611
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,331
The brother...?
Yep. Mm-hmm.
That one.

612
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,133
I'm gonna finish my workout.
Okay.

613
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,936
God, what a coincidence.

614
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,470
He's an amazing man,
your father.

615
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,105
Oh, jack, don't forget
the treadmill's on!

616
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,408
( thud )
jack: Oh, shit!

617
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,885
But I fell.

618
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,887
Frank:
What is wrong with you?

619
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,555
People are not
just wandering around,

620
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,524
Waiting for you to make
movies about them, bruce.

621
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,426
This is a public space,
frankie.

622
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,628
They don't wanna be filmed,
they shouldn't come here.

623
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,363
Jack: Where are we going?!
Where are you taking me?!

624
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,498
We're going home, dad.
Take me back in there!

625
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,234
You heard the doctor!
He's an orderly.

626
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,436
Don't contradict me,
god damn it!

627
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,171
What's wrong?

628
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,173
He wants drugs.
Jack!

629
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,008
Come here, please.
Please, listen to me, man.

630
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,376
I am in deep pain, man.

631
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,078
The doctor said
I needed some painkillers.

632
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,013
No, the doctor said
advil is fine.

633
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,415
Told me oxycontin.
He did not say oxy--

634
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,084
He did not say oxycontin.
<i>He</i> said oxycontin.

635
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,552
You do not
need it, jack.
Shh.

636
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,554
Give me a darvon.
Okay, jack, listen to me.

637
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,089
Drugs are not your friend.
I am your friend.

638
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,390
And what I'm gonna do
as your friend,

639
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,591
I'm gonna take you
to a meeting.

640
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,059
Can I get your car keys?

641
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,128
I'm gonna take him to a meeting.

642
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,932
Make sure you get that dvd.

643
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,434
I've been abducted!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come here!

644
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,903
Jack! Don't do it, jack!

645
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,204
Give me those fucking pills!

646
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,408
Well, it's nice
to see you again.

647
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,545
Yeah, you really don't
have to say that to me.

648
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,148
What are you talking about?
I mean, I knew you
weren't going to call me.

649
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,151
Which is actually
totally fine, so...

650
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:04,154
Uh, I already did.
Twice.

651
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,223
Check your phone.

652
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,194
I don't...
Look, frank,

653
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:14,932
I don't do what we did
last night, okay?

654
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,466
And I know that
lots of girls say that,

655
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,603
But I really never, ever,
ever do that stuff.

656
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,638
Okay.

657
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,508
And now it turns out
that you know my father,
who I want to kill,

658
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,246
And anytime I get sucked back
into his whole crazy world,

659
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,081
It ends very, very badly.
So...

660
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,355
Lassie, I actually
don't know your dad,

661
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:42,359
But I do know what it's like
to want to kill a relative.

662
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,628
But hey, look...

663
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,098
I'm not trying
to suck you into anything.

664
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,635
I'd just really love
to go out on, like,

665
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,972
A regular date with you,
you know?

666
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,374
We could see a movie.

667
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,043
Maybe get something to eat that
isn't part of your underwear.

668
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:03,313
( both chuckle )

669
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,449
Oh, my god.

670
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,051
( clears throat )

671
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,586
Hi, everyone,
my name is jack.

672
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,989
Uh, I'm an alcoholic
and a drug addict.

673
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,991
All: Hi, jack.

674
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,994
Drugs and alcohol...

675
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:20,130
Cost me my career
as a movie star.

676
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,399
And I only say that
in case any of you doubt

677
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,735
That this disease
can take away

678
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:27,270
The things
that you love the most.

679
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,008
That's what happened to me.

680
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,076
Uh, just one more thing...

681
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,078
If any of you ladies
wanted to have sex with me

682
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,280
Back when I was a somebody
and didn't get a chance...

683
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,548
Meet me out back.

684
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,384
I also have a pool.

685
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,389
( applause )

686
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,496
Ever work at a strip club?

687
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,364
Bruce?
Yeah?

688
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,566
Hi, my name's david.
Hi.

689
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,036
This is my wife natalie.
Hello.

690
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,039
We related to everything
you said in the meeting.

691
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:05,042
We wanted to be
in the movie business
our whole lives.

692
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:10,580
And when we got sober,
we swore we would finally do
what we were supposed to do.

693
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,582
That's why we
started our company.

694
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,384
Los angeles pictures.

695
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,087
<i>Los angeles.</i>

696
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,755
Angels.

697
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,191
Did you know that
angels are everywhere?

698
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,726
I did not know that, david.

699
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,628
There's one
standing next to you.

700
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,797
Don't be afraid.

701
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,632
That's sonya.
She follows us.

702
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,103
Did you come with jack knoll?

703
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,538
Are you friends?

704
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,506
Jack? Yeah, big time.
Good friend.

705
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,076
No, hit it, hit it, hit it.

706
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,345
Do you think that you and jack
would be interested in

707
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,481
Making movies with us
about angels?

708
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:47,484
Thanks to dentistry,
we have plenty of money.

709
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:51,121
Oh. You guys are like
christian tooth fairies.

710
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,522
( all laugh )

711
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,858
That's amazing!
We're ready to go!

712
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,726
Oh!

713
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,696
We're just looking for
like-minded artists to join us.

714
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,298
You know what's weird?

715
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,134
Jack, only yesterday,
was talking about

716
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,503
How much he loves angels.

717
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,805
( gasps )
oh, my god.

718
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,808
It's a miracle.
It's a miracle.

719
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,244
So, how much money
do you guys have?

720
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,445
( both laugh )

721
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,646
We have a lot.
Shh.

722
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,648
Uh-oh. Shh.

723
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,250
Shall we pray?

724
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,852
Let's!
Let's pray!

725
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,136
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
claudia...

726
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:43,340
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Be very quiet.

727
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,411
Help! Mom!

728
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,147
Shut the fuck up!

729
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,415
Okay, okay! Just do it!

730
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,184
( gasps )

731
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,253
( door opens )

732
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,422
Hey, bro.
Where you been?

733
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,424
Well, jack and I
went to a meeting.

734
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:04,161
After which I was
approached by some
very serious film producers.

735
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,929
I need my keys.
I'm late to meet lassie.

736
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,364
Okay, have a good time.

737
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:08,765
You got the dvd, right?

738
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,668
Weren't you supposed
to get the dvd?

739
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,704
How do you know
he's not home?

740
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,239
He stayed for
another meeting.

741
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,908
So, where you
gonna take lassie?

742
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,177
Just get the dvd
out of the player
and stop talking.

743
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,245
Why are you always
so mean to me?

744
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,716
It's fucking gone!

745
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,685
Shh. He's sleeping.

746
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,921
Frank: Fine.

747
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,890
Where are you going?

748
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,392
I'm going to get it.

749
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,865
What if he has an alarm?

750
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,868
You think he has an alarm?
He has no furniture!

751
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,470
But you think he's
gonna pay for an alarm?

752
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,606
Use your head, frankie!

753
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,875
I'm sorry!
I'm not a god damn criminal!

754
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,476
Yeah, well,
it's just as well,

755
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,945
Because you'd be
a terrible one.

756
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,883
Bruce, the guy has guns!
I know he has guns!

757
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,852
And he will use them on us
if he ever watches that video.

758
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,821
So are you gonna
help me get it back?

759
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,923
Or are you gonna
stand out here all night
and whine like a little bitch?

760
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,792
Oh, I'm a bitch?
I'm a bitch?

761
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,393
Then how come
you're the one

762
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,429
Always sucking
jack knoll's balls?

763
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:13,663
He's my friend!

764
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,732
( squeals )

765
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,637
The pig is in the pool.
The pig is in the pool?!

766
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,306
Fuck.
He's fine.
He's swimming.

767
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:26,376
What are you talking about?!
Pigs can't swim!

768
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,245
Jack shouldn't have
kept a pig by the pool.

769
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,447
It's irresponsible.
It's not our fault.

770
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,249
We are not
leaving him in there!

771
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,783
Fine, you go get him.
You get him!

772
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,452
I'm going on a date
after this!

773
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,786
I can't swim!
What?!

774
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,922
I can't swim, frankie!
I never have!

775
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,291
I don't like water!
I can't even drink the stuff!

776
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,461
Fuck!

777
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,336
( gasps )

778
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,573
I think he's dead!
I think he's dead!

779
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,675
Heimlich him!
Heimlich him?!

780
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:02,545
Do it! Heimlich him!
Squeeze his little belly!

781
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,980
Oh, shit!

782
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:08,785
( squeals )

783
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,423
Is that a condom?

784
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,458
Yeah, that's definitely
a condom.

785
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,627
Get it off!

786
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,864
Who the fuck is out here?!
Jack! Jack! It's bruce!

787
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,866
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
What are you doing here?

788
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,935
I was worried about you.
Hey, dharma d-cup.

789
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,938
And I thought it would be good
if I could be here when
you got home.

790
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,475
And it's a good thing
that we were, because your pig
fell in the pool, man.

791
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,377
Is he all right?
He's fine.

792
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,645
We saved him.

793
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,480
Mr. Knoll...

794
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,882
Since we're already here,

795
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,751
Would you like us
to get the dvd player fixed?

796
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,486
That's a good idea, frankie.

797
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,754
Jack: Oh, don't worry about it.

798
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,489
My housekeeper
took it home with her.

799
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,991
Her husband fixes 'em.

800
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,962
( latin hip hop playing )

801
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,387
Hey, guys.

802
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,789
We're looking for
ramon and celia.

803
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,791
They just left
right now, bro.

804
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:25,061
Right. Um, do you know
where they went?

805
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,864
None of your business.

806
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,867
You're done now?

807
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,535
What's up, homes?

808
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,071
Listen, cecilia,
the chiquita who lives here,

809
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:37,674
She works for a guy
called jack knoll.

810
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:41,678
You know jack knoll?
He's a big tv actor.

811
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
You don't have a tv.
That's okay.

812
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:46,416
Jack's a really good amigo
of mine,

813
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,452
And he sent me over
to just grab something from--

814
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,454
They just left. If you
wanna come back a little--

815
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,456
Maybe we'll just
have a quick look.

816
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,125
Maybe I'll just
break your fucking legs
if you take another step.

817
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,994
Oh, you're gonna do it?

818
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,430
Okay. You're a lot bigger
standing up.

819
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,132
Frank: Sorry to disturb you.
Just get the fuck out of here.

820
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:04,667
You see that?

821
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,186
( clattering )

822
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,928
I can see it!
It's just here!

823
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,196
Oh, my god.

824
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,867
You have to do it.

825
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,604
What?
You have to go in.

826
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,174
I swore on my sobriety that
I wouldn't steal anymore, frank.

827
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,509
And besides,
breaking and entering
a stranger's home

828
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,145
Is definitely a felony,
and I've already
got two strikes!

829
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,481
If you think you're going
to manipulate me and get me--

830
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:56,619
Fine! I'll go. I'll do it.
That's fine.

831
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,488
Bruce! Neither of us
should do it!

832
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,758
But, frank, if I get caught
and go down for 30 years,

833
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,193
Will you do me a favor?

834
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,728
Promise you won't put mom
in a nursing home.

835
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,234
Frank: Wait! Wait!

836
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,110
Stop pushing me!
Okay.

837
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,748
( clattering )
ugh!

838
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,619
You okay?

839
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,597
( tv playing )

840
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,916
( speaking spanish )

841
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,087
( speaking spanish )

842
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,055
( grunting )

843
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,959
( speaking spanish )

844
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,170
Aah!

845
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:24,173
What are you doing?!
He's attacking me!

846
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:28,077
Shake him off!
He's really strong!

847
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,179
Frank, frank! Stab him!

848
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,148
What?!
Take this knife and stab him!

849
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,783
I'm not fucking stabbing him,
bruce!

850
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,251
He's a million years old,
it doesn't matter!

851
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:38,021
Okay, just bring him over here!
I'll stab him!

852
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:41,758
Aah! He fucking bit me!

853
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,826
Give me the dvd player!

854
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:47,230
( speaking spanish )

855
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,132
Frank, good luck.

856
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,602
Bruce! Bruce!

857
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,903
What the fuck?!

858
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,015
It really took you
14 hours to get me out?

859
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:09,152
When bruce gets arrested,
we always let him
spend the night.

860
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:12,155
Your mother and I decided
we shouldn't play favorites.

861
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,891
Bruce is a fucking criminal!

862
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,626
Ex-criminal.

863
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:19,162
And you're scarcely
in any position to judge.

864
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,164
Here.

865
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,832
Come on.

866
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,241
Stop sign!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

867
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,187
Ah, there we go.

868
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,326
( phone rings )

869
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:51,728
Hello.

870
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,863
I am so sorry about last night.

871
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,865
Don't even worry about it.
Bruce called me.

872
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,400
He told me all about
your father's scare.

873
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:59,736
Are they sure
that it's not a heart attack?

874
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:03,039
Yeah, he's...

875
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,774
They said he's fine.

876
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,643
Good.

877
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:09,045
So, you wanna
get together later?

878
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:12,315
Right. Well...

879
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:15,084
Frank, I just don't think
that I have the time.

880
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,056
Right. Okay.

881
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,924
The relief organization
that I work for,
they just offered me

882
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,127
This position in china
that I'm thinking about taking.

883
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,863
<i>So, it's just</i>
<i>kinda crazy right now.</i>

884
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:29,399
But if I'm ever
in death valley,

885
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:33,002
Then, you know,
I'll absolutely give you a call.

886
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,805
Okay.

887
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:39,809
Okay. Have a safe trip.

888
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,210
( beeps )

889
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,351
Ow! Fuck. Ow.

890
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,221
Hey, bro. I got it.

891
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,257
All broken up.

892
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,263
I also got all the tape.
That's for you as well.

893
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:03,399
And don't worry, jack's maid
isn't gonna press charges.

894
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,436
Are you okay, bro?

895
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:08,771
Did someone
touch you in prison?

896
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:18,414
Look at me and tell me
you don't have any more copies.

897
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,783
( sighs )

898
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:24,787
I swear on my sobriety

899
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,290
That I don't have
any more copies.

900
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,402
Now swear that
no one else has any.

901
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,474
Bruce:
Okay, since your impotence

902
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,843
Is apparently
so embarrassing to you,

903
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49,979
I had claudia
completely re-edit my movie.

904
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,380
Which means, technically,

905
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,316
I don't even have
to show it to you.

906
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:54,851
Because as you will soon see,

907
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:56,986
This movie no longer
has anything to do with you.

908
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,321
But I'm happy
for you to see it,

909
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,523
Because you're my brother
and I love you.

910
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,859
Claudia,
play it for him.

911
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:05,027
Well, what you're about to see,
in my opinion,

912
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:07,764
Is a serious step back
from the integrity
of bruce's original work.

913
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,032
Would you just press play,
please.

914
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:14,303
Okay, will you just
stop yelling at me?
You're being rude.

915
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,773
Just play it.

I originally planned to put
fuzz face on the genitals,

922
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:47,170
But it's actually a lot funnier
with genitals.

923
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:51,274
Especially since you were
having so much trouble
with your genitals.

924

I'm sorry.
Who the fuck are you?!
Bruce: This is arthur.

Arthur, this is frank.
Arthur's a bigwig
in the whole fuzz-face game.

926
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,583
And what exactly did you
plan to do with this?

927
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,319
It's gonna be submitted to
a sex-tape site in the valley.

Hey, idiots, I uploaded it

Yes, I am nervous
about being killed!

951
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,450
As soon as he sees that video,
you don't think he's
gonna kill you, too?

952
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:10,119
I am nervous about
being actually shot!

of maybe somebody
on the internet

I'm the director.

00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:05,474
The most original

962
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:08,077
Shut your mouth.
We'd like it back.

963
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,612
I mean,
a sex tape with no sex:

964
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,580
That is just like...
Genius.

965
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,349
Yeah, it was great.

966
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:15,351
The thing is, it was actually
sent to you by mistake.

967
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:17,486
So, we're really gonna
need you to destroy it.

968
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:20,623
I can't do that.
Once it goes up,
it's up for 72 hours.

00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,159
Wait, wait wait.
You're saying it's on
the internet now?

970
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:26,195
Come check it out.
You got some great
feedback, dog.

971
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:30,499
Dad! Cut it
with the welding, man!
Come on!

972
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:33,202
Is that all for me? Oh, my god.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's you.

973
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,271
Here's the deal:
Either take it
down right now or--

974
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,273
Is five boners good?
Five boners is great.

975
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,976
That's five out of five?
Five out of five boners.

976
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,277
And they're
real stingy with boners.

977
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,545
Yeah, they don't give boners
for anybody.

978
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,047
Dad, we have customers!

979
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,682
Pal, pal,
you wanna negotiate?
No, I don't.

980
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,417
They call me alfred bitchcock.

981
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,419
( laughs )
that's hilarious.
That is funny.

982
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,088
I don't know
what that means, though.

983
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,456
You want a car?
I don't want a car.

984
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,724
I got a '93 honda
right outside.

985
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:57,193
I have a dui
and I drive a vespa.

986
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,495
Kinky in kuala lumpur
thinks that I'm a visionary.

987
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,765
If other men are on our site
and they see a guy like you,

988
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,767
Having trouble
getting an erection,

989
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,470
Keeping an erection,
forming an erection...
Right.

990
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:10,206
I think that
they'll feel a lot
better about themselves.

991
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,743
I don't want to be too forward,
but would you like to get some
coffee or something later?

992
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:15,611
Any time.
Oh, that'd be great.

993
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,747
Oh, wait, did you
mean romantically?

994
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:20,182
Most certainly romantically.

995
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,018
Bruce, can we leave, please?
Sure.

996
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,253
All right.
Hey, send us more stuff.

997
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:26,055
Seriously, guys,
you cannot fucking mess with
people's lives like this!

998
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:28,157
( whispering )
I really appreciate
your support.

999
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,126
You will take this down,
or you will face
the fucking consequences!

1000
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,128
( whispering )
I will call you.

1001
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,363
Do you think
I didn't just see that?

1002
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:38,100
You heard the guy.
They've only got like
15,000 subscribers, tops,

1003
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:41,370
Mostly in asia, and he's gonna
take it down in 72 hours.

1004
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,806
I'm not waiting 72 hours!

1005
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:47,143
Why are you so embarrassed
about your impotency?

1006
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,679
I don't have impotency!

1007
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:53,682
I had a brief
one-time-only episode.

1008
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:57,319
It happens to everyone.
I was impotent last night.

1009
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,489
I know. I was.
I mean, I had just
watched your video.

1010
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,825
So it was probably some kind of
fraternal sympathy softie.

1011
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:05,561
But even so, claudia
had to put three fingers

1012
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,396
Up my ass last night
to get me hard.

1013
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,799
I understand your pain.
We're family.

1014
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,734
Hey. David!

1015
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,803
No, this is a good time.
I've just come from church.

1016
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,615
Lassie:
<i>Do you want me to hum?</i>
<i>It's just my jaw hurts.</i>

1017
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,584
Mother of god...

1018
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,086
Okay, dad, that's enough.

1019
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,788
Well, that was excruciating.

1020
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,390
Just tell me
you can get it down.

1021
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,525
This is outside
of our area of expertise,

1022
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,728
Although sydney
did just email me
that it is illegal

1023
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,198
To film someone
in an unflattering manner
without their knowledge.

1024
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,100
And that was
definitely unflattering.

1025
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,367
Oh, dad!

1026
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,336
What? Sidney, he's my partner.

1027
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:49,705
How am I suppose to help you
if I don't know what's
going on?

1028
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:54,310
I think you should call
judge collins and have him
issue a take-down order.

1029
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,178
Oh, here's his number.
Thank you, dear.

1030
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,583
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!
You showed the intern?!

1031
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:03,586
Everything here
is confidential.

1032
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,728
They're dentists?
That's right,
and they are super rich, mom.

1033
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,864
And they wanna make a movie
with jack and I.

1034
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:16,899
That's fantastic.
I know.

1035
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,501
I'd love to have you
involved in some way.

1036
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,336
Me?
Of course.

1037
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:23,472
It's been too long since you
and I have created art together.

1038
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,407
When did you two
ever make art together?

1039
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:26,709
My painting.

1040
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,211
Don't you remember
I sat for that?

1041
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:30,579
Ugh. Yes.

1042
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,181
Great things are happening.

1043
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,883
Sobriety has worked wonders
with your life.

1044
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:36,385
Excuse me. Am I invisible?

1045
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:40,723
Your beautiful sober son
just put me in a porn video
without my permission.

1046
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:43,192
Oh, stop it. There is nothing
in that video that earn it

1047
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,227
The title of porn
and you know it.

1048
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:48,464
You watched it?!
You showed it to mom?

1049
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:50,599
You showed it to dad.
To help get it down!

1050
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,701
Mom, why would you watch that?

1051
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,170
I watch all of bruce's films.

1052
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,704
Besides,
there is nothing wrong

1053
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:58,174
With a mother seeing
her son's penis in repose.

1054
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:02,411
Had you gotten aroused,
I would've stopped watching.

1055
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,614
Can we stop talking about this?
I am seeing a judge tomorrow.

1056
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:08,284
And all of this
is gonna be behind us.

1057
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,685
Stop being
such a drama queen.

1058
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,254
Mom, I'm on a web site
where people fuck fruit.

1059
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,923
It is not people, it is one man,
and it's very funny.

1060
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:15,558
And don't talk
with your mouth full.

1061
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,627
Oh, my god. Please be poison.

1062
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,396
When did he become
such a prude?

1063
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:21,630
Yeah, you know,
I hate to say it,

1064
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,332
But I think I agree
with her on this one.

1065
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:24,900
I mean, what was the point
of your mother and I having sex

1066
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:27,803
With the door open
if we were raising a puritan?

1067
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,405
( all laugh )
dad?

1068
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:30,673
Thank you, my darling.

1069
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,675
( phone rings )

1070
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,276
May I be excused?

1071
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,879
Oh, look who's
finally being polite.

1072
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,216
You know, some nights
I really miss the sound
of you guys making love.

1073
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:42,251
Yeah, me, too.

1074
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,620
Lassie: I'm so sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

1075
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:45,854
What is going on?

1076
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,723
( gunshot )
I swear to god,

1077
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,992
If you fire one more shot,
I'll fucking kill you!

1078
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,994
My fiancé!

1079
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:54,463
( gunshots )
my fiancé called him
and told him everything!

1080
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,465
I have no idea
what he was thinking!

1081
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:59,602
So of course
my dad just totally flips out
and he goes to grab his gun!

1082
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,670
So I just locked him
in there in the shed!

1083
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:05,374
And is this a normal reaction
to a situation like this?

1084
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:08,611
He's freakishly
protective of me
in his own weird way.

1085
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,913
Jack!
Hey, buddy, it's bruce!

1086
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,015
Jack: Stay out of this!

1087
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:17,920
I'm gonna open the door,
but you have to give me
your gun.

1088
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,455
No!
The thing is, jack,
it's really not cool

1089
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:21,890
To shoot people anymore.

1090
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,026
It's illegal.

1091
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:27,496
Besides, I've got
really good news.
What news?

1092
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,466
I am opening the door.

1093
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,601
Oh, my god.

1094
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,603
Give me the gun.

1095
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,372
What's the news?

1096
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:38,607
I got us producers. Yeah.
Oh, really?! You did?!

1097
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,943
Why don't you just take drugs?
Just take drugs again.

1098
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,544
Why would you say that?

1099
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,380
Because you are just as bad--

1100
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,282
You're worse, actually,
when you're sober.

1101
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:49,051
So please, I am begging you
to take drugs, jack.

1102
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:55,057
First of all, I don't think
you should be calling me jack.

1103
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:58,494
I think you call me dad.

1104
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,967
Hey.

1105
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,502
Hi.

1106
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,905
You okay?

1107
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,383
You sure you're okay?

1108
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:36,098
Sorry if I'm giving you
mixed messages.

1109
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,701
I don't really think
that it takes a genius

1110
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:43,706
To figure out why
I'm a little bit...
Confused.

1111
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,510
I think we're all
a little bit confused.

1112
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,547
Thanks for being
a good guy.

1113
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,015
I'm really not.

1114
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,683
No, you really are.

1115
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,656
What do you mean, the judge
thinks we should leave it up?

1116
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,525
Well, apparently,
these gossip websites
bribe clerks

1117
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,794
To alert them when people
get down sex tapes,

1118
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,529
In case there's
a celebrity involved.

1119
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,031
Anyway, lassie
is a celebrity's kid,

1120
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,799
And there's only
48 hours left,

1121
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,535
So the judge thinks
it's just not worth the risk.

1122
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,537
Okay, you know what?
Fuck it.

1123
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,806
Hey, mom. Can I borrow
one of dad's ties?

1124
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,875
I got my meeting
with the producers
and I wanna look fancy.

1125
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,744
Oh, of course you can.
Where are you going?

1126
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,679
I'm doing what
I should've done
from the very beginning.

1127
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,447
I'm telling lassie.

1128
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:27,616
Why?
The judge can't
get down the sex tape.

1129
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:28,951
What? No, wait--

1130
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,819
I'm not asking your permission.

1131
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,388
No, I told you, man.
She's never gonna see it.

1132
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,723
I'm telling lassie
and going home.

1133
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,761
Can you believe that pussy
came from your pussy?

1134
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:41,029
What about phil?
Maybe he can help.

1135
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:44,032
Who's phil?
Phil...

1136
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,634
I love you, mom.

1137
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,169
( chuckles )

1138
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,171
His cell mate from prison.

1139
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,173
The guy who eats rats?

1140
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:52,941
Don't be so negative!

1141
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:54,610
He hacked into a bank
and got 20 million dollars.

1142
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,879
He's not just some guy
that eats rats.

1143
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:59,915
Hey, phil, it's bruce.
Long time, man.

1144
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,950
I'm actually just calling
'cause I need a favor.

1145
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,420
( whispering )
he's talking to his friend,
the ex-con. He eats rats.

1146
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:06,889
Don't tell mother
I told you.

1147
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:08,657
Yeah, is it okay
if I send over my brother?

1148
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,460
What?! I'm not going!
He's a computer whiz!

1149
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:12,928
He can get the sex tape
off the internet!

1150
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,197
He's a rodent-eating
ex-convict I don't know.

1151
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,665
Hey, we're both coming.

1152
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,938
Hello?

1153
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,678
Hello?

1154
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,013
Phil?

1155
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:34,483
Hi.

1156
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,752
Um, is phil here?

1157
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,958
( deep voice )
hello, bruce.

1158
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,626
Phil?

1159
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,764
It's phyllis now.

1160
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:52,935
Oh, my god!
That's weird.

1161
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:55,904
I'd like
to introduce you to frankie.

1162
00:57:55,906 --> 00:58:00,175
Oh, the brother. Charmed.

1163
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,745
Kiss the hand.

1164
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,253
Mmm.
Oh.

1165
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:13,522
Come in, boys.

1166
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,696
♪

1167
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:25,234
( inhaling deeply )

1168
00:58:25,236 --> 00:58:28,103
Oh, no.
I am clean as a whistle.

1169
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,706
I'm impressed.

1170
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:32,040
( exhales )

1171
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,182
( sighs )

1172
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,185
Oh. No, thanks.

1173
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:46,522
It's not nice to make
a lady party alone.

1174
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,258
Especially when she's
doing you a favor.

1175
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,561
Right.

1176
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,830
So, uh, phil...
Do you think maybe

1177
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,698
We could get this movie
down off the internet?

1178
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,933
It's phyllis.

1179
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,134
Yes, it is.

1180
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:02,571
I get so horny
when I smoke pot.

1181
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,172
You, too?

1182
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,644
( exhales )

1183
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:11,313
You know, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way,

1184
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:16,318
But I found your film
very healing.

1185
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,921
( sighs ) I've had a lot
of sadness lately.

1186
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:21,323
A lot of new girls do.

1187
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:27,062
Grieving the lost phallus,
it's normal.

1188
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,830
It's so normal.

1189
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,832
But I have to tell you,

1190
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,235
When I saw what happened
to you last night,

1191
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36,805
Good lord,
I didn't miss my cock one bit.

1192
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,675
Would you like to see it?

1193
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:40,876
My phallus.

1194
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:42,144
( chokes )

1195
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,146
I asked if I could keep it.

1196
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,582
I keep it in a jar.

1197
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,116
Well, I mean, not all of it.

1198
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:50,586
Some of it they had to use
to construct my vagina.

1199
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,622
It's an amazingly
interesting procedure.

1200
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:57,359
You don't have to go into
all of that for us, phyllis.

1201
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,030
You be nice
to your auntie phyllis...

1202
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,765
You little shit.

1203
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,300
No, no. Frankie didn't...

1204
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:08,904
Frankie would love to hear
all about your penis operation.

1205
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:12,107
It's just we're kind of in
a hurry to get the video down.

1206
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,776
( bang )

1207
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,311
Why has no one
asked to see them?!

1208
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:17,913
Your tits?

1209
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,748
I'd fucking love
to see your tits.

1210
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,855
And how about you, frankie?
Fancy a peek?

1211
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,294
Um...

1212
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:35,764
Phyllis: I will not help people
who don't support me!

1213
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,766
What is your problem?
What did I do?

1214
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:40,769
You hesitated!
When someone offers
to show you their tits,

1215
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,304
You don't hesitate, you look!

1216
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,905
Bruce, I don't even
know this guy!

1217
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,173
Why should I
look at his tits?!

1218
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,942
Phyllis:
<i>Her!</i> Motherfucker!

1219
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:50,145
That's it.
I'm done helping you.
Bruce!

1220
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,682
I'm not gonna be late
for my meeting to watch you
abuse my lady friends, frank.

1221
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:55,183
Bruce, I'm sorry!

1222
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,685
Don't say it to me!

1223
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:57,953
( car door shuts )

1224
01:00:57,955 --> 01:00:59,755
( engine starts )

1225
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,096
Phyllis?

1226
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:10,365
It's me again.

1227
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:14,670
♪

1228
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:18,940

1229
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:22,077

01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:34,256
You're a very good dancer,
frank. ( chuckles )

1234
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:40,028
♪ I'm just a man

1235
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,764
♪ when I look at you

1236
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:47,169
Listen, I would
really like to...

1237
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,438
But I'm actually seeing
someone right now,

1238
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,240
And I'm kind of
old-fashioned that way.

1239
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,179
Please don't be mad.

1240
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:59,314
She's a very lucky girl.

1241
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:04,786
So... Do you think you could...
( exhales )

1242
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:08,190
Maybe help with the sex tape?

1243
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,196
Well... ( inhales )

1244
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:16,798
Since you
couldn't get it up,

1245
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,800
I may as well get it down.

1246
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:23,138
( both laugh )

1247
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,942
Let's see what we have here.

1248
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:29,778
I really appreciate it,
phyllis.

1249
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,049
You know...

1250
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,318
There is something
you could can help me with.

1251
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:42,924
Anything.
I have this date tonight, and I
really, really like this lady.

1252
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,761
I think I might be a lesbian.
You don't have any problem
with that, right?

1253
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,162
No.

1254
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,498
Well, I got waxed
for the very first time.

1255
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,233
You know...

1256
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,834
Down there.

1257
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:55,370
( gulps ) mm-hmm.

1258
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,439
At the end of the day,
I went with the brazilian.

1259
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:00,842
And, god, I hope
I didn't make a mistake.

1260
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,444
I just want everything
to be pretty.

1261
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,884
Would you like...

1262
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,052
Would you like me
to take a look?

1263
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:13,121
Oh...

1264
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,389
Would you?

1265
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,391
Yep.

1266
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:17,926
Okay.

1267
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,271
Natalie: Mmm.

1268
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:33,542
Oh, lord,
again we thank you so much

1269
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:36,077
For jack and for bruce.

1270
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,481
In your name we pray. Amen.

1271
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,217
All: Amen.

1272
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,219
Good, good.

1273
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,888
Thank you. Thank you.

1274
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:53,528
And we also wanted to talk
to the two of you about, um...

1275
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,897
Sex.
Yeah!

1276
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,167
Uh-huh.

1277
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:03,171
Well, you see,
my wife and I, we're celibates.

1278
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,307
Shut up.

1279
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:08,176
We've taken
a lifelong vow of chastity.
Oh, my god.

1280
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,912
Oh, we don't expect you
to live a similar lifestyle.

1281
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,113
Oh.
Oh, dear no.

1282
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,982
We could never.
No.

1283
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:20,856
But we do feel very strongly
about our films being sex-free.

1284
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,858
Sex-free?

1285
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,259
Yes.
( groans )

1286
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:26,127
You want a film
with no sex in it?

1287
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:27,996
Correct.
Yes.

1288
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,599
Lots of angels.
Zero sex.

1289
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:32,467
Is that going to be a problem?

1290
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:36,404
Maybe.
No.

1291
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,623
Phyllis!

1292
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:58,059
Oh, I love you, phyllis.

1293
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:09,170
Lassie: Look at us.
We're on regular date,
like regular people.

1294
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:12,040
It's nice.
It's a miracle.

1295
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:15,043
When do I get
to read your book?
Because I kinda want to.

1296
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:19,648
Probably never.
I'm pretty sure it sucks.

1297
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,249
I'm pretty sure
it sucks, too,

1298
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,518
But I still
wanna read it.

1299
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,987
I won't judge you.

1300
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:28,123
Maybe the next one.

1301
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,258
Excuse me.

1302
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,260
Hey, it's you.

1303
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,062
Love the video, dude.
Fuckin' hysterical.

1304
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,263
Sorry, this happens
all the time.

1305
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,098
Seriously, seriously.

1306
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,067
It's the funniest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1307
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:41,603
You know it got
like a million hits
in three hours today?

1308
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,605
Awesome. Fuck off.
You know? Thanks.
Yeah, fuck off.

1309
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,473
Oh, it's her!
My god.

1310
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:48,009
I do not know how
you handle that shit.

1311
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:52,414
Eat my bra! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Eat my bra! Yeah!

1312
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,149
What did he say?
I don't know.

1313
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:56,217
I don't think
he was talking to us.

1314
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,192
What?

1315
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,372
Lassie: <i>We could act out</i>
<i>your masturbation fantasies.</i>

1316
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:19,708
<i>Maybe that would get you hard.</i>

1317
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,312
Someone must've pirated a copy
off the original site before
I shut it down.

1318
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,181
I'll be a cheerleader

1319
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:29,451
And you be the captain
of the football team.

1320
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:32,153
Maybe you just need
some kind of encouragement.

1321
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,390
I'll cheer you on.
I'll cheer you on.
I'll cheer you on.

1322
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,737
Please get it down, phyllis.
I'll do whatever you want.

1323
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:52,073
We can dance.
I'll look at your penis.

1324
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,475
Frank...
Get the jar.
Does it open?

1325
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,076
Frank! Frank!
I'll touch it!

1326
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:58,079
Frank, I know how you feel.

1327
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:01,082
You're embarrassed...

1328
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:03,084
And you're ashamed...

1329
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:05,086
And you want to die.

1330
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:08,623
The exact same way
I felt when the guys
on my high school team

1331
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:12,093
Walked into the locker room
and I was dressed
in a cheerleader's uniform.

1332
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,763
But it was at that moment
I got a glimpse

1333
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:18,767
For the first time
of my true me.

1334
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:22,037
And that is what
I want for you, darling.

1335
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:31,079
Let your humiliation
set you free.

1336
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:35,216
Come here. Come here.

1337
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:39,220
That's a very nice shampoo
you're wearing.

1338
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,222
Oh, now he'll never
work with me.

1339
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:45,126
Jack? Don't be silly.
He adores you.

1340
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:47,262
Mom, he tried to shoot a guy
who cheated on his daughter.

1341
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:49,798
I put her in a sex tape,
which is now being viewed

1342
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,534
By eight million people
since breakfast.

1343
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:57,205
It's not a real sex tape.
It's just a funny little movie.

1344
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,542
That's it.
What?

1345
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:02,143
It's a movie!

1346
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,812
I will just tell jack
that what I shot

1347
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:08,316
In the clubhouse
was a teaser for a larger film.

1348
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:09,818
What's the film?

1349
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,786
I'll work that out!
It writes itself!

1350
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,160
Hi.
Hey.

1351
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:20,728
I'm so glad that you called.

1352
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:25,200
My dad is at a meeting,
but I ordered us some dinner.

1353
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:28,670
So I hope you're hungry.

1354
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,211
Here. Sit.

1355
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:39,347
I actually have
something to tell you.

1356
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:42,617
It's kind of the reason
we're having chinese food.

1357
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,819
You're going to china?

1358
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:49,357
The opposite.
I told them no.

1359
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,561
It's just kind of
the worst time for me to go.

1360
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,266
It might have a tiny
little bit to do with you.

1361
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,708
You all right?

1362
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,778
You do these?

1363
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,781
I was really into knights
when I was a kid.

1364
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,851
"a strong, kind man
dipped in metal."

1365
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,521
Listen, it's actually
a very normal fantasy

1366
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:24,659
For a girl whose father
has never been in
a relationship, ever.

1367
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:30,798
You can connect the dots
and see why perhaps I was
in need of some chivalry.

1368
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,707
So... What did you
want to tell me?

1369
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,313
I'll tell you later.

1370
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,398
( phone rings )

1371
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,933
( grunts )

1372
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:11,406
( phone rings )

1373
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:13,408
( sighs )

1374
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,842
Hey.

1375
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:16,444
Thank you
for the date yesterday.

1376
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,547
It was really, really nice...
And normal.

1377
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,951
Listen, lassie,
can I talk to you
about something?

1378
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:24,619
I'm actually just running
into a meeting right now.

1379
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:25,987
Can I give you a call back
in a little bit?

1380
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,589
<i>Oh, and your brother,</i>

1381
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:29,791
<i>He stopped by</i>
<i>and he took your car.</i>

1382
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:31,793
He said he needed to trade it
for a crane or something.

1383
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:34,362
I don't know.
He said you'd understand.

1384
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:36,965
( beeps )

1385
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,675
( sighs )

1386
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:54,282
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1387
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,454
What's going on?
<i>This is actually a really</i>
<i>fucking horrible time</i>

1388
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,589
For this to be happening to me!
What?

1389
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,725
<i>I just don't--</i>
<i>I don't understand it!</i>

1390
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:07,629
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>why nobody will fuck me!</i>

1391
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,721
But everyone else has sex,
why can't we?

1392
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,323
Bruce: "why can't I?"

1393
01:11:35,325 --> 01:11:38,459
Everyone else has sex,
why can't I?

1394
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:45,733
Behold. I am an angel,
sent by god, to make you pure.

1395
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:47,735
Bruce:
Dad! I'm gonna need more wings!

1396
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:50,405
Chris: What?
Bruce: More wings!

1397
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:52,407
Bruce...
Bruce: Cut, cut!

1398
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:55,810
Isn't this fucking amazing?

1399
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,746
What is this?
I'm making a movie
of that night.

1400
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:02,483
What night?
The night
in the clubhouse, bro.

1401
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:07,422
Okay, everybody, places.
We're going again.

1402
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:10,825
No, actually not places.

1403
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,828
Could everyone just
pack this stuff up and go home?

1404
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,431
I'm sorry.
Frankie, stop being such a girl!

1405
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:18,433
Do not disrespect me
in front of my crew, okay?

1406
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:20,768
I will slap you down.
I will fucking slap you down.

1407
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,904
All I'm doing here is trying
to make everyone else happy.

1408
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:25,940
The producers want an angel.
Jack won't do the movie
unless dharma is in it.

1409
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:29,711
Jack is in the movie?!
Of course jack's in the movie!
Jack's the money!

1410
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:32,714
But he won't do it
unless dharma's in it,
who can't fucking act!

1411
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:34,382
Stop fighting, both of you!

1412
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:35,917
And I am doing
all of this, bro,

1413
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:38,386
Just to make sure
that you and cassie

1414
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:39,587
Don't get embarrassed.

1415
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:40,988
Bruce...
What?!

1416
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,623
Isn't jack
supposed to be in this scene?

1417
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,827
Could everybody just stop
talking to me?! Please!

1418
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:49,931
Okay, we're going again!
Last time! Rolling sound!

1419
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:51,499
Bruce!
Action!

1420
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:55,103
Don't listen to the a--
to the angel.

1421
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,538
Have sex. Have sex now.

1422
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,740
Bruce: Angrier!

1423
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:00,408
Have it all the time!

1424
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,812
Oh, fuck!

1425
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,719
What are you doing here?
Tell me that you didn't know
that he filmed us that night!

1426
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,122
I didn't.
I swear to god, I didn't.

1427
01:13:14,124 --> 01:13:16,157
Well, did you know that
it was on the internet?!

1428
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,160
Bruce: Cut! Places!
We're going again!

1429
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,962
Oh, my god.

1430
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:23,464
Action.
Oh.

1431
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:25,600
Why won't anyone
have sex with me?

1432
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:26,868
Wait...

1433
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,137
Is that an angel?

1434
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:33,074
I forbid the blood
to enter your cock.

1435
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,676
Rise, pes--
penis, rise!

1436
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:37,678
Bruce, could you have her
say "phallus" instead?

1437
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,013
What is all of this?

1438
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:41,149
Fill with blood!
Fill that member!

1439
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:43,684
Bruce is making a movie
so... ( sighs )

1440
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,420
So that we won't
have to be embarrassed.

1441
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:46,687
What are you talking about?

1442
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:50,525
Sex out of wedlock is wrong.

1443
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:52,026
Get that member
filled with pleasure!

1444
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:55,830
I forbid the blood
to enter your cock.

1445
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:57,832
Phallus!
I forbid the blood
to enter your phallus.

1446
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,100
I'm the devil!
Fuck that pussy!

1447
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,569
...To enter your phallus.

1448
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:04,539
You big penis!
Could she say "organ" instead?

1449
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,175
Motherfucker!
Come here!

1450
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:11,179
Did you put
my precious daughter
in a porno video?!

1451
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:13,848
You are fucking dead!
Do you hear me?!

1452
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:16,083
Oh, shit!
Time to die, motherfucker!

1453
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:20,121
( gunshot, screams )

1454
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,857
Bruce! Bruce!

1455
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:25,126
Fuck! Okay, okay.

1456
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,595
Someone call an ambulance!
Call 911! Call 911!

1457
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:29,997
He shot me in my belly.
I know, bro. I know.

1458
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,799
Just keep breathing.
Just keep breathing.

1459
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,202
( groans )
just keep breathing.

1460
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:37,805
( chuckles )
I knew you loved me, bro.

1461
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:41,609
You! When you grab me
and put me against the wall,
you gotta really hold me!

1462
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:44,045
You wanna go again, jack?
Let's go!

1463
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:45,813
He doesn't know anything.

1464
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,648
He just thinks that
he's playing the part
of a father

1465
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,052
Who found out his daughter's
in a sex video. It's fine.

1466
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:53,754
You're such a fucking asshole!

1467
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,890
What?
What's the matter with you?!

1468
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:58,759
I just want an option
in case we decide to go dark
in the end, bro.

1469
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:00,495
Lassie, I'm sorry.
Leave me alone.

1470
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:02,230
Lassie--
leave me alone!

1471
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,067

And what the fuck
was he thinking,
not letting me play the angel?

1495
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:40,595
That woman
was absolute dog shit.

1496
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,130
So, you still talk to that girl?

1497
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:44,865
<i>She still mad at you?</i>

1498
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,867
She won't take my calls.

1499
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,704
She hasn't respond
to any of my emails.

1500
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:53,007
Yeah, I heard
through the grapevine
that she's going away.

Try havin' half the planet
watch some guy

1505
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:03,751
Not be able to fuck you
all night.

1506
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:06,854
That's embarrassing, my friend.

1507
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:08,689
Anyway...

1508
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:11,025
<i>I thought you should know</i>
<i>she's going away...</i>

1509

Just in case one of the people
on this phone call

1510
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,631

acting like a man, darling.

I don't give a shit
how many people

1514
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:26,307
Saw what happened
in that clubhouse that night,

1515
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,309
And I don't care
what they thought about it.

1516
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:31,912
They weren't there.
They were just watching.

1517
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,852
If you really fell in love
with that girl that night,

1518
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:41,188
Then what the fuck are you
still doing in the desert?

01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,831

Hey, bro.

1523
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:07,148
( car door shuts )

1524
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,122
Listen, I know
we haven't talked since
the whole angel debacle,

1525
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,391
And I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry.

1526
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,393
After you left,
I got to thinking...

1527
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,762
Maybe I'm incapable of change.

1528
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,230
But, look, no camera.

1529
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:25,399
Wow, I'm impressed.
Right?

1530
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,001
You proud of me?

1531
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:29,737
What time's her flight?
Uh, 7:00 pm.

1532
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:32,073
We better hit the road
before we lose the light.

1533
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:38,279
Hey, bruce,
can you help me
with something in here?

1534
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:39,780
Sure.

1535
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,418
You need a strong guy?
Yeah.

1536
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,988
What is it?

1537
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:50,257
Frank! What are you doing?!

1538
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:52,259
You're not filming this, bruce!

1539
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,128
