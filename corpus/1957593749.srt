[busy kitchen noise]

4
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,133
[Lisa] That looks right. Put a
little of that in there

5
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,167
and save the rest for tomorrow
in pasta bowls.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,933
Put a little oil in it, make it
easier to move.

7
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:52,800
Bill, [indistinguishable]

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,600
That's beautiful. Cover it.
Put it over there.

9
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,900
A little bit more salt
and pepper on those.

10
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:08,333
It looks great, just great. Now
get it into the freezer right
away, go. Go.

11
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,900
Coming behind you...

12
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,367
Careful.

13
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:27,733
[Lisa] Hi. Are you a waiter or
a bartender? You want the
owner, Vivian.

14
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:30,333
-[Marty] No I want you.
-[Vivian] Hello, can I help you?

15
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:34,967
[Lisa] It's personal.

16
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,100
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,300
[Marty] Your husband's
in big trouble.

18
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,600
The people he owes want their
money by five o'clock.

19
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:47,233
Otherwise, there's gonna be a
knock at your door.

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,867
[Lisa] I'll be back before
we start serving.

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,500
[Vivian] What?

22
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,200
[Lisa] Where is he?

23
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,067
He's at lunch with
an investor.

24
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,967
Come on, Samantha. This
is serious, get him on
the phone.

25
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:09,700
I would but, he disconnected
his cell phone.

26
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:15,167
If you find him could you tell
him that hood was here again
this morning!

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,667
[T.V. and bar noise]

28
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:28,967
[Eric] Come on, Gypsy Girl. Come
on, Gypsy Girl. There you go,
come on, come on.

29
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:35,467
Come on, baby. That's me, that's
my girl! Come on, baby! Whoa!
That's me!

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,633
I told you twenty to one,
ready to run. Honey?

31
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,200
[Lisa] This time you've gone
too far. Don't you ever,
ever do that again.

32
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,300
[Eric] Wait, help me here.
What exactly did I do?

33
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,767
[Lisa] It's not bad enough to
embarrass me at work now you've
got people threatening us.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,567
They're coming to
the house, Eric.

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,900
[Eric] No they're not. That was
a big misunderstanding. It's
all been cleared up.

36
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:59,067
Look I'll send Viv a dozen
roses. And it was a lousy thing
to do to you too. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,667
[Lisa] You're always sorry.
How much do you owe this time?

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,767
[Eric] Not a dime. Lisa, I
said I was sorry. Wives
get angry at husbands,

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,067
husbands get angry at wives.
It's the ying and yang of
married life.

40
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,467
Right, Jack?

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,600
This is for you. Come have
a quick drink with me,
come on.

42
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:19,467
[Lisa] I'm working a party,
Eric. I'll meet you at the
gallery after work.

43
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,667
[Eric] Lisa?

44
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
I like you like this.

45
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:29,833
Cheeks flushed those wild
untamable strands of hair.

46
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:34,733
I could always
make you smile.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,633
Let's skip
the gallery.

48
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,833
[Lisa] You're crazy.

49
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,400
[Eric] I'm one
lucky guy.

50
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:53,700
[Eric] I wouldn't do a
documentary. I see something
more like, the civil war.

51
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,667
[Mrs. Feld] What's
the difference?

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,433
[Eric] Well I
see a ah,

53
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,700
a latitudinal history of
um, racing in America.

54
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:09,767
I-I would um, I would intercut
profiles of the owner of a stud
farm. A trainer, a jockey,

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
a female jockey,

56
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,900
the stable boy, the racing
fan and then build up to
the climax,

57
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,067
The Derby.

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,567
[Lisa] Have you seen any
of Eric's films?

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,433
They're thoughtful
without being solemn.

60
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:27,333
[Eric] Well, she is my
biggest fan. And of course
my toughest critic. Ha ha.

61
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,333
How about if I send
you some cassettes?

62
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,067
[Mrs. Feld] How much would a
project like that cost?

63
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:36,067
[Eric] Well, you know we're
talkin' about a labor of
love here.

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,733
[Mrs. Feld] So what do
you think, dear?

65
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:43,800
[Lisa] Eric's had three
wonderful documentaries on PBS
and some of his industrials

66
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,800
are little gems.

67
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,967
But I think this might be the
film that wins him his Emmy.

68
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,833
[Eric] Major backer would meet
some very interesting show
business people,

69
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:56,067
we'd go to premiers, you might
even have to come out to L.A.

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,933
[Mrs. Feld] Oh. This would
be tax deductible.

71
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,667
[Eric] We'd work
something out.

72
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,233
We'd have a lot
of laughs.

73
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,967
Hey, hey do you know why
cannibals don't eat clowns?

74
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,067
[Mrs. Feld] No, why?

75
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,933
[Eric] Because they
taste funny.

76
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,567
[laughter]

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,300
You wanna hear a
great title,

78
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,733
"Oh, For a Horse
With Wings."

79
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:23,800
[Mrs. Feld] Oh...

80
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,800
[Eric] Thanks for helping me
with Mrs. Feld tonight.

81
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,467
[Lisa] You don't have to thank
me for telling the truth.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,067
[Eric] Could have mentioned
I haven't had a film in
seven years...

83
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,133
[Lisa] I wanted to believe
everyone of those years
you could do it again.

84
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,633
I could have told
her that, too.

85
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:54,067
[Eric] Hey, there's no one
like you, honey.

86
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:03,300
[Vivian] Here you
go. Try that.

87
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,900
[Lisa] Don't be mad
at me, ok?

88
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,500
[Vivian] Hmm?

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,233
I'm going into business for
myself. I just signed the
incorporation papers.

90
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,367
[Vivian] Why?

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,133
[Lisa] We're in way over our
heads financially.

92
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:22,133
We just drove Sarah up to
college last week.

93
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:26,767
Barely been making Bruce's
tuition payments the last
two years.

94
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,133
With the two of
them away...

95
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,500
[Vivian] Look it takes
capital to start a
catering business.

96
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:36,100
[Lisa] Dad left me a savings
bond. I've got a little over
nine thousand saved up.

97
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,067
Th-that's enough
isn't it?

98
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:42,067
[Vivian] Oh wow, is
this moving fast!

99
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:49,800
You think you're a little
spooked by the empty nest?

100
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:54,067
There's another reason I
need my own business.

101
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,467
Yeah?

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,633
I'm...

103
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:04,433
thinking of
leaving Eric.

104
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,533
Oh my God.

105
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,533
[Lisa] It's a lot worse
than I've told you.

106
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,967
Business is a disaster, his
gambling is out of control,

107
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:20,867
he takes every penny you pay me
if I don't sneak it right into
my personal account. It's...

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,800
I've just been
waiting for Sarah.

109
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,067
Oh he's such a
great guy.

110
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:32,067
You guys always seem to have
such a good time together.

111
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,433
Honey I'm sorry.

112
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,733
So it's okay?

113
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,800
We'll still be
friends?

114
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:45,333
Of course we will. We'll
work something out.

115
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:48,667
I'll talk to Gary, see if
he can't throw something
Eric's way.

116
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
[Lisa] He won't take it.
I know him.

117
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,200
[Vivian] Oh but he must see how
desperate things are.

118
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:58,067
[Lisa] He has no idea. He's
living in a dream world.

119
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,767
[Eric laughing] Ha
ha. I did.

120
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,867
[Gary] All right here we are,
six stores. Specialty
clothing along here...

121
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,500
[Eric] Can I have a
charge account?

122
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:13,267
[Gary] Espresso bar over
there. And my video store.
I'm keeping the franchise.

123
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,167
[Eric] Well no wonder, this
is a great location.

124
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,267
But I'm having a problem, I
uh, need someone to manage
it for me.

125
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,767
[Lisa] You know movies.

126
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,533
Paid forty grand the
first year.

127
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,333
[Eric] Well what you don't
understand when you're a
graduate of Betty Crocker U,

128
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:31,267
is that there's just some things
you can't put in the alumni
newsletter.

129
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,367
Eric, you don't have to tell
Princeton magazine you're
managing a video store.

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,533
[Worker] Mr. Reynolds, can I
see you for a sec?

131
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:43,067
Yeah sure. Just be
a minute.

132
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,500
Honey, that was very
sweet what you tried
to do over there.

133
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,733
But what does a girl from
Betty Crocker U know?

134
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,067
It was a joke.

135
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:52,067
I'm sorry I didn't go to
college. I'm sorry I
embarrass you.

136
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:55,833
You don't embarrass me. I was
teasing you. We kid around,

137
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,767
that's what makes our
marriage so great.

138
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,100
Oh yeah, our marriage is
paradise. The house is leased,
the furniture's leased,

139
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,967
we're in debt up to here. I
hate living like this.

140
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,900
If you wanted a regular
paycheck you should've
married a janitor.

141
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,633
You think we're talking
about money here.

142
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,267
-I'm a filmmaker.
-You're a fabulous filmmaker.
You just don't make any films.

143
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,433
You love to put me down for
having a dream, don't you?--

144
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,933
I married you because
you had a dream.

145
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:25,633
I didn't marry a guy who
plays the horses. Or who
plays around.

146
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,133
[Eric] Gary, thanks for the
offer but, I don't think I
was cut out for retail.

147
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,367
[Vivian] What'd he say?

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
[Eric] But I will take some of
your money in my poker game.

149
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,733
[Vivian] Oh dear.

150
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:45,633
[Lisa] Excuse me? You-you let
somebody raid my account.

151
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,633
Your teller says I've got
only forty two dollars.

152
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,600
I know I've got more
than nine thousand.

153
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,700
[Mrs. Horvath] Please, sit.

154
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:58,733
Let's see what's
going on here.

155
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,367
You had that much but you've
been making ATM withdrawals.

156
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,133
Those not mine.

157
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,800
Who withdraws three hundred
dollars a day for a month?

158
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,933
Do you have some ID?

159
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:24,500
This is a personal account. You
let somebody steal from me.

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,500
The system says there are two
cards. What about your husband,
doesn't he have one?

161
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:41,267
No I told you. It's not
a joint account.

162
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,133
Tell her.

163
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:47,367
About a month ago a
couple came in. He had a
statement for the account

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,100
and she had some I.D., I think a
credit card in your name. Only
uh, she wasn't you.

165
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:56,167
Um, they said that they
had lost the ATM card
for the account.

166
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,567
And well we issued
a new card.

167
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,467
Was it him?

168
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,633
Uh-huh.

169
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:19,233
[Lisa] This woman, what
did she look like?

170
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:25,300
She had beautiful hair.
Beautiful red hair.

171
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:38,333
* [sad music]

172
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,600
Thank you.

heard that uh...
-[zipping of bags]

175
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:27,333
what is this?

176
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:32,933
I went to the bank today.
They were surprised my
hair wasn't red.

177
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,800
Samantha and me?
That's nothing.

178
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,967
Nothing new I think
you mean.

179
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,767
Honey look, we've had some
rocky moments lately, what
couple hasn't?

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,567
Forging my signature and
stealing my savings is a
rocky moment?

181
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,067
The kids come first, they
needed money in their
checking accounts.

182
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,267
It's funny I had to give each
of them a hundred the day
they left.

183
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,800
I'll get around to
opening the accounts!
Aye I had a call today.

184
00:12:55,833 --> 00:13:00,233
HBO is this close to picking
up the racing documentary.

185
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:05,867
That money was mine. My name
was on the account. It was
from my dad...

186
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,933
-my work. I want it back now.
-I'll pay you back.

187
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:14,367
When I have it.

188
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,400
You used it to pay your
bookie didn't you?

189
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:21,500
They were comin'
after us.

190
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,767
You've got money. Give it me.
The poker game is rigged.

191
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,900
-Give me what you've got!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey would you
please calm down.

192
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,767
Mrs. Feld is gonna come
through and HBO I can
feel it.

193
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,600
Come on we're on a
roll here.

194
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,367
Come on...

195
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,900
Let go of me.

196
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,067
That woman is not gonna give
you a dime, HBO doesn't know
you exist...

197
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:52,133
Honey, don't you understand
the power of a dream?

198
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:56,200
I have to make this film.

199
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,867
[Lisa] Get your story
straight, Eric.

200
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,300
You put a couple of grand
on the ponies so the kids
would have book money,

201
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,400
or so you could win the
Jury prize at Cannes.
Which was it?

202
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,933
Well it was a
spur-of-the-moment thing.

203
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:11,633
It just seemed like a good
idea at the time.

204
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,300
We were gonna
borrow it,

205
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,500
hit the double, put it back, you
were never gonna know!

206
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:23,600
Would you take this, it was a
lousy game, I want you to
have it as a down payment.

207
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,933
Give me another shot!
Samantha's history.

208
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,933
I'm gonna quit gambling.
And I'm gonna take Mrs.
Feld's money

209
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,100
and give you ten
thousand dollars
right off the top.

210
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:38,667
Lisa, listen we have been in
some tight spots before, you
know that.

211
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,167
-I,I don't even
understand what's--
-Three hundred bucks?

212
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,133
You do something like this and
you think you can buy me off
with three hundred dollars?

213
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,500
Hey can we sleep on
this tonight please?

214
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:52,467
Things are gonna look
a lot different in
the morning.

215
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,133
That used to work, Eric. And
then for years I faked it and
I felt guilty and trapped.

216
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:02,433
And all the time you had
this other life. And I
felt trapped.

217
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,933
Lisa give me one more
chance. For the kids.

218
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,667
I'm leaving
you, Eric.

219
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
You've said
that before.

220
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:13,067
This time I
mean it.

221
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:26,433

223
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,933
[Sarah message over phone] Hi
this is Sarah. Guess what? I'm
out. Leave me a message.

224
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,900
Thanks, bye.

225
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:06,233
[Lisa into phone] It's mom,
it's after two where are you?

226
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,667
I'm on the road on the
way to Canada

227
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,633
and I just realized that I
don't have the new number
at Bruce's dorm.

228
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:18,667
I, I have something to
tell you guys.

229
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:26,133
So could you call me
at three one five five
five four one two five

230
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,700
before your first
classes in the morning?

231
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,500
I'll wait for
your call.

232
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:36,567
Bye, I love
you. Bye.

237
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,367
Hello?

238
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,800
[Sarah from phone] Mom, thank
God. Bruce and I are going to
the hospital, it's dad.

239
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,067
-[Lisa] What?
-[Sarah] He collapsed in the
drive-way.

240
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:32,667
Bruce said the doctor told him
it's some kind of stroke.

241
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,500
We'll meet
you there.

242
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,067
The Kingsleys were coming home
from a party, they think it
was about twelve thirty.

243
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:45,300
[Lisa] Thanks.

244
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,067
[Bruce] The car door was
open and he was just
lying there.

245
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,067
If the domelight hadn't
been on, they wouldn't
have seen him.

246
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,867
What I don't get is
where were you?

247
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,867
What were you doing
in Canada?

248
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,533
Mom?

249
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,133
He must have
needed cigarettes.

250
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:07,933
There were all these quarters
on the ground. They figured
he'd been robbed.

251
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,800
Mrs. McKeever.

252
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,567
I just showed the cat
scan to the chief of
neurology

253
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,100
and there's
no doubt,

254
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:20,167
it was a stroke and it
involves the brain stem.

255
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,433
Oh my God.

256
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,500
Now he could live a
few weeks

257
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,067
or he could go on for
a lot longer.

258
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:31,500
Now given the type of stroke
he's had, he's probably gonna
have some trouble swallowing.

259
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:36,600
But uh, there's no other
paralysis. And fortunately his
speech hasn't been impaired.

260
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,467
Is he awake? Can
we see him?

261
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,133
Yeah. But he's
still groggy.

262
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:47,433
Doctor...

263
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:50,800
really, how
bad is it?

264
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,633
It's hard
to predict.

265
00:18:54,667 --> 00:19:00,067
We'll know more in the next
forty eight hours.

266
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:06,067
Mom, you had to see us in
person for some big
announcement?

267
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,833
Could we do this
some other time?

268
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:16,200
You're finally leaving
him weren't you?

269
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,067
[Sarah] He's got me at
left wing right now,

270
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,133
but I think he's moving
me to sweeper for the
Colgate game.

271
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,233
I was counting on
you coming.

272
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:37,067
[Eric] I'll be there, honey. I
have never missed one of your
games, I'm gonna start now.

273
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:41,467
Dad, Dad we love
you, ok?

274
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,967
We're gonna stay right here
beside you 'til you get out
of the woods.

275
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:50,967
[Eric] Never in the woods. I
never liked 'em. How can you
bet with a tree.

276
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:58,733
This whole thing was just a way
of gettin' us together for a
few hours.

277
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:03,000
Monday morning I want the two
of you back in class.

278
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:06,767
Ok, but only if you promise
to be well enough to go
home by then.

279
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,867
So mom can take
care of you.

280
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,367
* [dramatic music]

281
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:27,333
[Doctor] He's come a long way in
one week. We're gonna have to
discharge him soon.

282
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,600
When will he get off
the feeding tube?

283
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,467
Probably never.

284
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,733
But we can put a shunt inside so
we can feed him directly into
his stomach.

285
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:41,067
He can move around, maybe even
sip a little liquid or nibble
on something soft.

286
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,333
Basically he's gonna
need help for the
rest of his life.

287
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,700
Oh boy.

288
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah.

289
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:53,067
So... we're talking permanent
round-theclock nursing care?

290
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,833
Yes. I think you'd be
better off taking care
of him at home.

291
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:05,767
As long as he's got you, I
think it's a perfectly
good way to go.

292
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,900
[Lisa] Easy, I
got you.

293
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,733
[Eric] Uh,

294
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:23,333
I'm gonna sleep
better tonight...

295
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,833
having you
next to me.

296
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,867
I moved into
Sarah's room.

297
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,767
Boy, you really
miss her, huh?

298
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,100
Yeah, that's it. No reason to
start confronting reality at
this late date.

299
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,333
I can still make
you smile...

300
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:47,133
Liking you was never
the problem.

301
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:54,833
God, Lisa. Did you add
some steps before I
came back?

302
00:21:56,167 --> 00:22:02,767
Ohh, oh...

303
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,067
Don't misjudge the
way things are.

304
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,433
You're Bruce and
Sarah's father...

305
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:18,167
they'd be here if they could.
Since they can't,

306
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,067
I'm not gonna walk
out on you.

307
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,100
What happens when
I get better?

308
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:31,900
I'm here now, I think
that's what matters.

309
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:37,733
I'll uh, I'll make you
love me again.

310
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:42,600
Could we take this one
day at a time?

311
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:49,067
The reality is, you're never
going to see me because I'm
going to be out all the time.

312
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,800
[Eric] Doing what?

313
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:59,067
Trying to pay for nurses,
food, rent, textbooks...

314
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm not gonna let you do
it alone. I'll figure
out something.

315
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:08,433
[coughing]

316
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:14,133
Ok.

317
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,667
Just try not
to talk.

318
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:28,800
If that's
possible.

319
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,233
Just one thing, when
the kids ask,

320
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:40,433
tell them this is the way
you want it to be.

321
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,467
Needs a
valve job.

322
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
[Lisa] What kind of money are
we talking about?

323
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,833
Well the dealer will
charge you eight hundred,

324
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:06,233
I'll do it for six, I'll have it
for you tomorrow night.

325
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:09,433
Six hundred's a problem
for me right now.

326
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,367
[Art] Put it
on a card.

327
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,067
The cards got taken away, my
husband's had a stroke.

328
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,133
Wow uh, gee I'm sorry. He comes
in here all the time, give him
my best.

329
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,967
I will.

330
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:32,633
Listen, since you know
us I... I mean,

331
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,533
this is hard.

332
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:39,833
I don't have a job right now,
but I've never not paid a
bill in my life.

333
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:42,067
I need a car to
look for work.

334
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:49,467
Can you fix it and let me
pay you, I don't know, a
hundred a month?

335
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,300
No I couldn't
live with that.

336
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:59,433
Can I use your phone to call
another tow truck?

337
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,600
You know, I got this
sales rep who has
this gimmick.

338
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:04,867
Every time he comes in he
gives you something, you
know.

339
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,067
Makes it impossible for him to
leave without an order.

340
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,067
Sometimes it's wine,
hockey tickets.

341
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:13,267
This week he left
me these.

342
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,567
Looks like they'll
fit perfectly.

343
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,500
You said I had to
pay up front.

344
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,367
I said I wasn't willing to
take money if someone
didn't have any.

345
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,233
-[Lisa] So you're saying--
-[Art] You can use that old car
out there,

346
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:30,800
pick this one up tomorrow
night. I close at six.

347
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,300
[Lisa] We'll pay
you back.

348
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,933
Sure. Soon as you're husband
gets back on your feet.

349
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:40,267
I can't depend on
that happening.

350
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,433
Keys are under
the visor.

351
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:47,200
Thank you.

352
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:52,833
I meant what I said, I will pay
you back, eventually.

353
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,300
I can tell.

354
00:25:55,333 --> 00:26:00,867
[alarm clock]

355
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:15,100
[Lisa] Was it bad tonight?

356
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,800
Been asleep at all?

357
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:24,100
[Eric] No. I'm sorry you get up
every night and do this.

358
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:28,533
[pouring sound]

359
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:29,767
[Lisa] You want codeine?

360
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,500
[Eric] God, yes. Could
you, could you just--

361
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:41,600
-[Lisa] Sure, sure... oh!
-[bottle falling]

362
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:07,733
[kitchen timer ringing]

Maskin and son.

365
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,467
Uh Mr. Maskin, it's
Lisa McKeever.

366
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,500
I'm running late and I don't
want to hold you up, so can
I pick up my car tomorrow?

367
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:32,067
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's
done. Tomorrow'll be fine.

368
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,667
Great. I-I've been handing
out uh, samples of my
brownies all day,

369
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
your ideas working,
that's why I'm late.

370
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,500
My idea?

371
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,233
About not going any place
without a free sample

372
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:43,733
Since nine this morning
I've booked a luncheon
and a baby shower

373
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,733
and in another half, I might
even have a whole bar
mitzvah.

374
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,933
You rent rooms
or what?

375
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:54,833
I'm a caterer. If I'm lucky and
get a deposit, I may even be
able to pay you.

376
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,067
You sure my keeping the
loner another day is ok?

377
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:02,067
Oh no, that's ok. I'll
switch'em on the way to
work in the morning.

378
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,600
Ok, I-I gotta go.

379
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:09,267
Uh hey um, hang
in there.

380
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,233
Ok.

381
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:15,133
[phone beeps]

382
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:18,600

383
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,167
[crashing]

384
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,900
Hey! Hey, hey,
shoo, go!

385
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:42,767
[knocking]

386
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:49,367
Hello?

387
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:01,500
* [dramatic music]

388
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:33,833
She's not smoking
again. Sorry.

389
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:37,433
No, no. These
are for you.

390
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:43,500
I didn't get the bar
mitzvah, I won't be
paying you for awhile.

391
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:51,667
You should see the garbage
people buy out of these
machines.

392
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,900
They'll be gone
by two..

393
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,767
[Lisa] I didn't make
these for sale.

394
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,133
I know but I-I can't eat all
of those. I'll have some
after lunch...

395
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,800
why shouldn't you
make some money?

396
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,267
Actually, that's a
good idea.

397
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,433
Caterers spend most of
their time waiting
around for jobs.

398
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:14,433
If I lined up a bunch of
places that could sell
fresh baked goods...

399
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,600
You know I usually eat at
the diner across the
street there.

400
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,600
Would you like to get a
sandwich or something?

401
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:28,633
I would, but I-I have a
twelve thirty meeting.

402
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:33,633
Right. Yeah well, thanks
for the cookies.

403
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,633
[sighs]

404
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,700
-Ow!
-Sorry.

405
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:48,667
You know I've taken care
of some very big people
in my time.

406
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,200
Like basketball
players?

407
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:55,867
Ha, I mean well
known people.

408
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,933
-What the hell is that?
-[sound of leafblower outside]

409
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,067
Just the gardener.

410
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,200
We don't have
a gardener

411
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:08,533
[Mrs. Skinner] Maybe the Mrs.
hired one. Somebody's gotta
clean up the yard.

412
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:14,867
* [dramatic music]

413
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,667
[Lisa] I need
commercial ovens.

414
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,067
What if I rented your kitchens
every night you're not using
them, say from six to two a.m.?

415
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,833
You have that
much baking?

416
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,200
Eighteen outlets,
seventy two dozen a day.

417
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,733
Wow!

418
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:48,133
I could do more. But I gotta get
home by two to change Eric's
nutrient bag.

419
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,767
How's he doing?

420
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,233
Well. You know you and Gary
could stop by any time
you've got a few--

421
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,400
[crashing noise]

422
00:31:54,433 --> 00:32:00,067
What the hell
is that?

423
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:08,133
* [dramatic music]

424
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:14,800
Ha. Just have to figure a
way to dampen the noise a
little bit.

425
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,333
Why are you doing
all this for me?

426
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:22,333
Figure you could use a little
help around here. With the
trees and the raccoons.

427
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,200
I would have got
to the trees.

428
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,967
I think taking care of
a sick husband and
working at night

429
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:30,433
to start your own business
that's a lot of work for
one person.

430
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:34,067
I know, but
there's no...

431
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,633
you just can't keep
doing things for me.

432
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:43,067
I like working with my
hands, kinda relaxes me.

433
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:46,567
Thanks.

434
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,333
Who's that?

435
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:03,133
The new handyman.

436
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:08,867
[commentator on T.V.]

437
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:17,100
I see you got the
filling station guy
trimming the trees.

438
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:22,067
It was his idea. We got
to talking when he fixed
the Explorer.

439
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,867
We paying him or what,
what's the deal?

440
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,433
No, he's one of my
brownie customers.

441
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:30,367
-Damn!
-[remote falls]

442
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:37,067
Hey, I dropped
the remote.

443
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:41,567
You drownin'
there or what?

444
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,733
Lisa you know how hard it is for
me to get outta bed.

445
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,367
Thanks, honey. I
am so bored.

446
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,867
[Lisa] Why don't you
call some of those
poker buddies.

447
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,367
Or those guys from the
track who've forgetten
you exist?

448
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,200
I never knew his name,
that mechanic.

449
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:04,833
[Lisa] Art Maskin.

450
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:19,067
-[Lisa] Hi.
-[Eric] Hi.

451
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
I brought you three
dozen brownies.

452
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,700
Oh.

453
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,267
Half walnut, half pecan.

454
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,767
Good um...
[laughs]

455
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,133
you know, you know um, the
other day when I asked you
out to lunch,

456
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:38,500
was that meeting just that
meeting that day or you always
kinda busy for lunch?

457
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:43,667
One of the things about caterers
it's hard work and you need
lunch to keep going.

458
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,267
Oh well you know uh, I'm gonna
finish here one thirty, two.

459
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,867
How about we grab a
sandwich then?

460
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Earlier would be better. I
should be home to relieve
the nurse.

461
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:57,200
Fine we'll make it a quick
sandwich. Won't even spoil
your dinner.

462
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,767
I'd like that. As
long as...

463
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,133
Yeah?

464
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,967
It's just lunch with one
of my customers.

465
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,100
Lunch means lunch.

466
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:11,567
See you then.

467
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,067
That new warehouse
club's incredible.

468
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:21,200
I got a pound of flower and
two hundred pounds of
baking chocolate.

469
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:24,200
Twenty percent below wholesale.

470
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,533
-[crashing noise]
-[Mrs. Skinner] Oh!

471
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:30,567
That woman missed her calling.
She's born for vaudeville.

472
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,067
I've gotta go out again. If Viv
calls about the flower,

473
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,533
tell her I'll get it out of her
garage tomorrow.

474
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,200
I thought you were off the
rest of the day?

475
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,567
No, I'm having a sandwich
with a client.

476
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,267
Well push it to tomorrow. We'll
send the clumsiest woman in the
world home and go see a movie.

477
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Sounds like fun. Wish we'd
talked about it earlier.

478
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:55,367
[Mrs. Skinner] Paper or plastic?
Mark my words, plastic, paper
does it to ya every time.

479
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,933
Must be a big client. Some guy
in the market for a couple of
tons of brownies?

480
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:04,967
We can do a movie on
Saturday. What shall
we have for dinner?

481
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:06,600
-Oh...
-[taps bottle]

482
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:11,067
you know, New York strip medium
rare, cottage fries, and a
caesar with anchovies.

483
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:17,967
-Right.
-[Mrs. Skinner] What are you
thinking of? He's got his drip.

484
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:23,167
[Lisa] Oh. Old habits
are tough to break.

485
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,767
Nice to see ya
so happy.

486
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,067
I'm late.

487
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:32,100
Tell him the trees need some
more work, will ya?

488
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,067
I uh, hope you
like chocolate.

489
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:42,433
[laughing]
Ok, admit it.

490
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:47,167
You were giving a formal
luncheon and your twelve guests
came down with pneumonia.

491
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,300
I finished up the ambulance
sooner than I thought so I
closed up early.

492
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,933
Some sandwich. You did
all this yourself?

493
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:02,533
I told you, I'm good with
my hands. Um, you sure you
don't want another lobster?

494
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:07,133
No thanks,
I'm stuffed.

495
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:10,067
Couldn't your dad have
spelled you at the station?

496
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,067
Well I uh, never
knew my dad.

497
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:16,600
I'm sorry, I assumed from the
way you answered the phone.

498
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:21,133
No um, when I bought the
station I had to come up
with a name,

499
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,333
so Maskin
& Son.

500
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,700
Sounds stable, likes you
been around forever.

501
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:33,800
Or, maybe I was just
wishing out loud.

502
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,333
How'd you learn to
cook like this?

503
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:43,267
I like to eat. When you
live alone there's TV
and cooking.

504
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,433
Thanks.

505
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,267
Mmm.

506
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,367
* [romantic music]

507
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,333
[Lisa] I thought you were
taking me home?

508
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,933
[Art] I am. In kind of a
roundabout way.

509
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:29,233
* [majestic music]

510
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,400
Is it legal?

511
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:36,967
Well as long as we stay
under the commercial
lanes FAA's happy.

512
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:40,200
And you just
do this?

513
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,067
Look. Horseshoe Falls.

514
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,133
When I was a kid I used to sit
on a fence next to this old
country airfield

515
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,200
watching this pilot fuel up
his crop duster.

516
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:55,667
Kept asking him questions
about how planes flew...

517
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,667
I never figured he'd take me
up for a ride.

518
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,733
And when you
grew up?

519
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:04,500
I knew it was the one
thing I had to do.

520
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:12,467
[Art] Look, look,
look down there.

521
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,700
[Lisa] It's so
great up here.

522
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,600
You forget.

523
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,367
You forget everything.

524
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,300
That was the idea.

525
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:50,067
[video poker sounds]

526
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:56,667
Hi. How are you?
Need anything?

527
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,667
I'm fine.

528
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,067
Nice lunch?

529
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,300
[Lisa] It was ok.

530
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:27,167
[Lisa] Business is
picking up.

531
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,533
We're putting on five party
shifts Thanksgiving evening.

532
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:34,600
I'm not quite sure
what we're gonna do.

533
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,133
We're having dinner
with the kids.

534
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:40,633
I meant about having
time to cook.

535
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,833
You know what drives me crazy
about you?

536
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:50,033
The way you think you keep
pulling the wool over my eyes.

537
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,900
I have no secrets
from you, Eric.

538
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,467
Oh no.

539
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,033
You just come in whistling
after a five hour lunch
with the tree trimmer

540
00:40:57,067 --> 00:41:01,800
because there's a bright
golden haze in the meadow.

541
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,867
Art and I have an
occasional lunch.

542
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,467
We're friends.

543
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,867
I'm not allowed to
have friends?

544
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,300
I got two more
Thanksgiving dinners.

545
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,900
Oh, big?

546
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:15,533
-One's forty people.
-Wow.

547
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:18,533
[Lisa] I'm interviewing party
chefs this afternoon.

548
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,800
But I still gotta find a place
to do the pre-cooking.

549
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,067
[Art] Do it at my house.

550
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,167
[Lisa] Really?

551
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,133
[Art] Sure.

552
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:29,100
[Lisa] That would
be great.

553
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,900
I can't get anything
done at home.

554
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:33,500
[Art] How's he doing?

555
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,433
[Lisa] Better.

556
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:39,067
Better but,
not great?

557
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,800
You have to understand
the way Eric and I
have been living.

558
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:55,167
He's a man who never not once
since we've been married ever
cleared the table after a meal.

559
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,267
When Sarah
was born,

560
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,400
we decided we should both
have life insurance policies

561
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,500
in case we were run over by
a truck or something.

562
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:06,733
He borrowed on the equity until
the company finally cancelled
the policies.

563
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:10,633
Naturally he didn't tell
me, when I found out I
asked him why,

564
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,867
he looked at me like I
was crazy.

565
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,067
"Native Dancer was even
money" he said.

566
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:26,600
He also loves his kids
more than any man alive.

567
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:29,500
[Art] You never
thought of leaving?

568
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:32,100
[Lisa] I thought
about it.

569
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,567
[Art] Just
never did.

570
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:38,400
[Lisa] There were all kinds
of good excuses.

571
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,100
Never be able to
support myself...

572
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:46,233
[Art] At least we're past that.
You're already make more money
than me.

573
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,800
[Lisa] Wasn't
really money.

574
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,700
He was Bruce and
Sarah's daddy.

575
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,633
They were crazy
about him.

576
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,233
I was crazy
about them.

577
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:58,767
You just don't seem like the
kind of person to put up
with all that stuff.

578
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,733
Affairs, gambling debts,
stolen money...

579
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:08,433
People change. I'm not
the same woman I was
when I married him.

580
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:14,067
You know, when my wife left I
realized what total strangers
we'd become.

581
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,267
The people who'd met and
fallen in love...

582
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,067
the ones with the private
nicknames and the ones who
stopped to pet stray cats,

583
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:24,500
those people had
just vanished!

584
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:27,400
Why did
she leave?

585
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:29,833
She never
really said.

586
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:33,600
And nobody else ever
came along?

587
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:39,567
Not 'til now.

588
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:54,667
I thought I was able to
leave him. I can't now.

589
00:43:56,067 --> 00:44:02,967
I don't want you to. I just want
you to know how things are.

590
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:10,933
It would be really nice right
now if you go wash your hands
or something.

don't know where
they were goin'

00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:42,533
Viv?

595
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:49,967
Can I uh, do something for you?

596
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:52,833
Yeah, save my ears.

597
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:57,700
Oh, sorry. You know uh, we
really don't know each other.

598
00:44:57,733 --> 00:45:02,233
I'm Art Maskin from
the garage.

599
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:16,800
Uh, would-would you like
me to uh, drive you
somewhere?

[Eric] Hey! I thought
I told you...

604
00:45:56,533 --> 00:46:00,467
Hey!

605
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,933
Hey!

606
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,767
Oh did you know that
Eric can drive?

607
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,900
He can barely get in and out
of his wheelchair.

608
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,400
Yesterday while you and Viv
were at Pittsburgh Plaza

609
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:15,500
he drove himself out to
the mailbox and back.

610
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,167
He's always
done that.

611
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,100
He's milking his invalid
routine. He's not nearly as
helpless as he pretends to be.

612
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:22,600
He admits
he's lazy.

613
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:25,233
Does he admit how angry he is?
That's the question.

614
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,167
Nobody likes what a
stroke does to you.

615
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,733
Angry about us.

616
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:34,733
About us? There's nothing to
be angry about. We're friends.

617
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:38,533
We are, that's
all we are.

618
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:41,933
Well you have to grant the fact
that it's after midnight and
you're here could

619
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,267
possibly suggest
something else to him.

620
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,967
I've been totally up front with
him about it being over.
Where's the pineapple?

621
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:51,900
-Pineapple? Here.
-I'm just taking care of him. He
knows that.

622
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:56,233
Maybe he does, but he doesn't
like seeing me around. He's
jealous. Ha ha.

623
00:46:56,267 --> 00:46:59,733
He lost the right to be
jealous after about the
first three women...

624
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:01,833
after he lost all my
money at the track.

625
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:03,900
It's not about
money for him.

626
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,333
Whose side are
you on?

627
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:15,233
I think that would be
obvious by now.

628
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:17,533
I can't...
yet...

[Eric] What time are the kids
coming home on Wednesday?

631
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:11,233
[Lisa] I don't know,
they're getting rides.

632
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:14,067
[Eric] When they were little
remember we used to always

633
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,667
go skating on
Thanksgiving eve.

634
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,400
That was the best
night of the year.

635
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:21,733
We had that rink
all to ourselves.

636
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:25,667
[Lisa] Could you put that
down for a minute?

637
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:33,433
I have all these
dinners I'm doing.

638
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:36,233
I'm gonna be cooking non-stop
for the next three days.

639
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:38,900
Well I could peel
potatoes or something.

640
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:41,267
You never peeled a
potato in your life.

641
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,400
Yeah well I could
learn. To help.

642
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:49,233
I've invited Art to have
dinner with us Thursday here.

643
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:51,467
I'm making all the dishes
at work, he'll just

644
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,800
cook the turkey and warm
everything else up.

645
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:09,700
That grease-monkey is not
coming through this door
into my house.

646
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:21,200
I don't wanna
hurt you.

647
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:24,567
I will say this
only once.

648
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,967
I feel like
a robot.

649
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:30,167
I cater.

650
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,933
I change
your bed.

651
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:39,400
I shop. I get up in the
night to change the drip.

652
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:44,067
Every minute of
every day

653
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:49,233
I think about the fact that I'm
the one who has to earn the
money for tuition,

654
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:54,333
medicine, doctor bills,

655
00:49:54,367 --> 00:50:00,100
and I pretend to the kids
everything's all right.

656
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:04,167
I'm not a robot, Eric.

657
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,967
I've said it's over
between us.

658
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:16,967
What you've done
to me...

659
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,767
it's just over.

660
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:27,633
What are you really
saying, Lisa?

661
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:33,367
I'm saying, if you want
Thanksgiving dinner
served in this house,

662
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,500
Art is going
to do it.

663
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:41,500
Forget Thanksgiving. You're
telling me to my face. You're
involved with the yard man.

664
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,400
I'm saying I
need help.

665
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:48,267
The kids can help. The
kids are great.

666
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,867
Sarah can bake and, and, and
Bruce and I can figure out
the turkey.

667
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,800
I want Art with me
on Thanksgiving.

668
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:03,067
Well what if that
isn't possible?

669
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:11,833
One way or another,
it's possible.

670
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:28,633
[engine stops]

671
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:41,467
-[Art] Hello?
-[door handle
shaking]

672
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:47,067
Eric, Eric, the
doors locked

673
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,967
Hello?!

674
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:56,133
[Art yelling
and falling]

675
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,200
[Eric] You ok?

676
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:06,067
Uhh. Yeah I'm ok. Just
kinda had the wind
knocked outta me.

677
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,567
[Eric] She's not home.
And I can't do much to
help you.

678
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,467
Anything feel broken,
should I call 911?

679
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,433
[Art] No, no I'm ok. Just,
just gotta catch my breath.

680
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:26,567
No don't do-- Whoa, hey,
hey! Ha ha. Hey you on
top of me. Sit back.

681
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,367
[Eric] Look, why don't you just
load me up before one of us
gets killed, ok?

682
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,967
[Art] Ok.

683
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:37,200
[commercials playing
on T.V.]

684
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:50,200
Good God, look at that.
I haven't had a beer in
two months.

685
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,867
You want a beer?
Have one.

686
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:59,333
Can't. Doctor says it's one
of the many ways I did this
to myself.

687
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:11,267
[beer bottle opening]

688
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:15,067
[beer bottle spraying]

689
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:19,067
[laughter]

690
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:35,067
[gasps]

691
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,433
One more's not gonna hurt
anything now.

692
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:46,800
No, no it's just for the taste.
One more's just wanna make you
keep on going.

693
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:54,767
So tell me, Art, what's in this
for you? Besides the chance to
torment a cripple.

694
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,733
Nobody likes to be
alone on a holiday.

695
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:03,300
Well, to each his own. Being a
fifth wheel doesn't sound too
swift to me.

696
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,900
I'll do whatever
it takes.

697
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:08,400
Whatever 'what' takes?
That's my question.

698
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:12,700
To be a part of
her life.

699
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:16,667
You're unbelievable,
you know that.

700
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,600
You come into my house and
you just, say something
like that.

701
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,600
She needs help. She's
about to snap.

702
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:27,233
Don't tell me what
my wife needs.

703
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:31,800
Yeah well, you just don't
seem to get it.

704
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:37,667
The most important thing
to her, is that you are
taken care of.

705
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,333
And you're gonna do that?
Well don't waste your
time, my friend.

706
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,500
I'm a real pain
in the ass.

707
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:46,267
[laughing]

708
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,167
Yeah well, you give it
your best shot. But,
it's an act.

709
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,967
And you know that after
just an hour, huh?

710
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:59,867
I know it because she's
loved you for twenty
three years.

711
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:17,300
I'm not gonna be able to
eat anything but yogurt
'til Easter.

712
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,067
[everyone laughing]

713
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,967
[Bruce] Turkey was
delicious, mom.

714
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,067
[Lisa] Art cooked
the turkey.

715
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,700
[Art] Um... anybody want
another cappuccino?

716
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,067
[Lisa] No thanks.

717
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,167
[Sarah] Mom makes it too
strong. Could I have
some regular decaf?

718
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,067
[Art] Sure, I'll put a
pot on.

719
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,667
[Sarah] Someone wanna tell us
what's going on here? Who
exactly is Art?

720
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,300
[Bruce] Come on, mom, he's
gonna be back in a second.
Who is this guy?

721
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,933
A friend.

722
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:53,367
Your mom's business is really
taking off. She's going all
the time now.

723
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,367
But...
I mean is he...

724
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,967
when we're
not here...

725
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:02,167
I'll say it.

726
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,433
We've been worried since
the hospital about you
two breaking up.

727
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:09,700
We're not
breaking up.

728
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,333
There's no big mystery here.
Art helps me.

729
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:14,967
He helps you.

730
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:17,967
[Eric] She's looking for someone
to help full time at work.

731
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:23,067
It's a temporary problem. That's
what your mother's saying.

732
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:27,067
No, it's not temporary.

733
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,300
I'm thinking of looking
for a cheaper house.

734
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:36,967
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is
not temporary?

735
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,800
Mom?

736
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:44,767
Honey, this is
our home.

737
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,200
A ranch would be better for you.
You could get around easier.

738
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:49,867
Be simpler for you to
eat with us.

739
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,733
With us?

740
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:57,567
With the family. When you
guys come home.

741
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:08,067
Made you something. I had
this windshield wiper
hose in my truck.

742
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:11,400
Great. Now you're gonna feed me
through something you found in
the back of your truck.

743
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:14,600
I sterilized it. Now we can hang
two bags before you go to bed.

744
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:16,067
No more waking up
during the night.

745
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,500
Lisa changes them.
She doesn't mind.

746
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:21,567
No, she loves gettin' up in
the middle of her nightly
five hours.

747
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,533
Real chance to do some husband
and wife bonding.

748
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,267
That was her on
the phone?

749
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,133
Yeah. Apple pie's are cooling.
She'll be here when the mince
meat's done.

750
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:34,067
When the phone rings in my
house, Art, I'll take the
calls, got it?

751
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:42,800
-Oh whatever you say. It's your
house.
-[machine beeping]

752
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:51,833
You know that ranch house you
saw, the one with the
separate apartment?

753
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:54,967
-[Lisa] I took it.
-[pouring]

754
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:57,900
Well I was thinking you know
I'm paying eleven hundred a
month here.

755
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:02,367
How about, I move into
that apartment.

756
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,233
You'd save six
hundred a month.

757
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:09,567
Well I think it's worth more.
But besides, I could also chip
into my share of the food.

758
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:17,967
Well that's what you
want isn't it? It
was your idea...

759
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:22,700
[Lisa] My idea was a cheaper
house. A ranch for the
wheelchair.

760
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,200
[Art] Well we spend all our
time together anyway.

761
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:31,900
Plus, when Mrs. Skinner's
out, there'll be somebody
in the house.

762
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:34,167
You think about him
more than I do.

763
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,800
I like him more than I do. He's
in an impossible situation.

764
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:43,667
And you think having you living
with us is gonna make things
less impossible?

765
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:50,833
Well, if I lived in the
apartment, wouldn't it
make things simpler?

766
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:54,567
-[Art] Hhm?
-[Lisa] No.

767
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,067
Don't you understand...

768
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:07,300
how hard it is having you near
me and having to pretend?

769
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:11,400
Pretend what?

770
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:21,733
-That we're just friends.
-* [romantic music]

771
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:32,133
Fine. We'll keep things just
the way they are.

772
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:34,367
That feels wrong too.

773
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,867
Like we've got some secret from
him as if we're waiting for him
to die.

774
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:45,133
Honey, I don't think he's gonna
die. Not anytime soon.

775
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:49,333
[Lisa] The house is
partially furnished.

776
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:51,433
Look at that
great tree.

777
00:59:51,467 --> 00:59:54,600
The apartment downstairs
has its own bath.

778
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,133
The kids rooms are twice
what they are now.

779
00:59:57,167 --> 01:00:00,133
[Eric] I thought the apartment
was for one of the kids?

780
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:04,400
[Lisa] No I rented out the
apartment. For eleven
hundred a month.

781
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:08,433
That means we're living here for
fourteen hundred instead of
twenty five hundred.

782
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:12,800
[Eric] Who are the tenants? I
hope they're not noisy.

783
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:16,400
[Lisa] One tenant, Art.

784
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:20,300
You're moving in the guy you're
having an affair with?

785
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:21,500
[Lisa] I'm not
sleeping with Art.

786
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,000
[Eric] Oh yeah right.

787
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:26,367
[Lisa] Never lied to you,
Eric, I never will. I'm
not sleeping with Art.

788
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,133
The word I used was 'affair',
Lisa. You care to comment on
that?

789
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,867
Eric I promised to take
care of you.

790
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,233
That didn't mean I was giving up
the right to take care of
myself, or be happy.

791
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:41,967
And he makes you happy.
You admit that.

792
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:46,533
-He's moving in.

Honey are you
in here?

796
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:23,167
He must be in his
room. Wait here.

797
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,100
[Art] Lisa!

[Driver] You ok?

801
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,167
-[Art] You all right?
-[Eric] Let go of my chair.

802
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,933
-[Art] Here, get in here.
-[Eric] I said let go of my
chair!

803
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:58,467
Did you hear what I said!? You
go back into the house!

804
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,233
[Lisa] We will go inside and
talk about this--

805
01:02:01,267 --> 01:02:04,700
-[Art] Eric... Eric...
[-Eric] We're not gonna talk
about anything! I'm out of here!

806
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:08,067
-[Lisa] Hold on. What are you
playing chicken with cars?
-[Eric] I am going to Sarah's.

807
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:10,467
She will get me
an apartment!

808
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,067
[Lisa] Would you come inside and
talk about this like an adult?

809
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,267
[Eric] No! No I wanna talk
about it out here!

810
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,167
So that all of our new
neighbors can see what my wife

811
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,500
and her boyfriend

Look at' em!

freezing. Do whatever the hell
you want.

[Eric] That's what I
intend to do.

815

are you taking me?!

[Art] Way I see it, you've got
the advantage now.

818
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,900
She thinks you tried to kill
yourself over her so,

819
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,867
she'll do anything
you want.

820
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,333
That was
the idea.

821
01:02:56,367 --> 01:03:00,400
It'll never occur to her
that you couldn't stop
because the uh,

822
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:05,100
wheels were wet.

823
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:09,133
What do you want?

824
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:17,333
How can you let her move you
into my house while I'm
still alive?

825
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:20,933
I want her to
be happy.

826
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:25,500
And you're willing
to share her?

827
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:31,167
[thumps chest]

828
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,133
Yeah.

Mechanics version of

You're one weird guy,
you know that?

831
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:52,233
Well this is, uh, one
weird situation.

832
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:06,833
Ok. Here's the deal.

833
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:12,067
There are some obvious
financial advantages
to having a tenant.

834
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:15,167
As long as he sleeps
in his own room.

835
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,367
And some major
drawbacks.

836
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,667
Like what are the kids gonna
think for example.

837
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,700
Bottom line,

838
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:30,167
he's willing to do stuff
for me and I'm willing
to let him stay.

839
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:43,600
Why are you suddenly willing
to look the other way?

840
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:51,100
I guess I realized out there
today that, you were right.

841
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,833

other choice.

-[Art] Ah no, no we wouldn't do
that.

everything you need?

849

[Eric] Yeah.

You think it was ok we flew over
here and left him?

853
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:13,267
Oh he's fine, he's got a stack
of catalogs he's doing his
Christmas shopping.

854
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:19,733
You've become the expert on my
husband. Next he's gonna have
you walking in bets for him.

855
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,967
He can talk to me. That's no
reflection on you.

856
01:06:23,067 --> 01:06:25,733
I'm just saying he takes
advantage of people.

857
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:27,600
I'm not the one
who misses him.

858
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:29,767
Coming over here
was my idea.

859
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,133
He know's we're here. He
said have a good time.

860
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:35,900
You're the one who's
talking about him.

861
01:06:37,367 --> 01:06:40,700
[Art] Lisa, Lisa there's
no reason if he builds
up his strength

862
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:42,267
he can't come
over with us.

863
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:46,467
I thought we came over
here to be alone.

864
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,333
[Art] You can't have
it both ways.

865
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:53,400
I mean we can do what we can to
make him part of our lives and
just start living

866
01:06:53,433 --> 01:06:54,900
and enjoy ourselves.

867
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:58,800
Or we can work shifts nursing
him and get off from what
martyrs we are.

868
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:02,967
But you and I can not organize
our lives, exclusively around
him.

869

We have to have
something else.

01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:24,067
I'm putting myself in a
home in the morning.

973
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:28,200
* [dramatic music]

974
01:15:35,733 --> 01:15:38,933
Come over here.

975
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,767
Nobody wants you
to leave.

976
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,867
How was it last night, Art. No
performance anxiety I hope.

977
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,633
[Art] I think Lisa and I think
that we need to talk.

978
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:11,267
Fine I'll start. I am not
living in this house with
you two anymore.

979
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:16,900
That's not what we want. Last
night was about you and me,
about the argument we had.

980
01:16:16,933 --> 01:16:21,733
You said some things about
Art that just sounded
so, vicious.

981
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:22,833
After all he's
done for you.

982
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:28,167
Well excuse me. I didn't mean to
offend Saint Arthur.

983
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,100
-[Art] Neither of us is proud--
-[Eric] Do you mind!?

984
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:35,200
May my wife and I have a word
without you sticking your oar
in!?

985
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:40,067
-He's just trying to help.
-Well surprise, surprise he's
not.

986
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:43,567
All right then
I'll say it.

987
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:49,633
We are sorry, Eric.
I am sorry.

988
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:53,067
It was my idea.

989
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:59,833
It was a cruel, bad,
unnecessary thing to do.

990
01:17:01,467 --> 01:17:03,100
[Art] I agree.

991
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:12,367
But Eric, no matter what
happens the three of us
are in this together.

992
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,767
So...

993
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:21,167
you two just imagine that
I'm gonna let last night slide?

994
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:28,400
I'd say that ninety percent
of loving is forgiving the
people you love.

995
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:35,133
I like you, Art. But I will
never ever love you. Ok?

996
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:43,133
[Art] Nobody knows the rules
here. Don't you see that? We're
all just makin'em up as we go.

997
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:44,800
Yeah I thought we
were gonna try and

998
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:48,433
figure out something that had
the remote chance of making
us all happy.

999
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:51,567
Well then we're all gonna
have to work at it.

1000
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,933
Yeah, what does
that mean?

1001
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:56,600
That means you gettin' off
your ass and showing her
you're alive.

1002
01:17:56,633 --> 01:17:59,400
You don't think she knows that
after twenty three years?

1003
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:02,933
I think for twenty three
years you've driven down
to the mailbox

1004
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:04,233
when you could
have walked.

1005
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:07,767
Now I think that you
better prove to her
that you can walk.

1006
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,900
Yeah well, when I really do
get better, you may just
lose her.

1007
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:16,167
Possible, yeah.

1008
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,633
You wanna bet?

1009
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:22,333
[laughs] You're on.

1010
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:29,167
What are you doing?

1011
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:34,533
Oh, trying to prove to
somebody or other that I
can walk to the mailbox.

1012
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:36,600
This is your idea?

1013
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:41,800
No, our roommates. Said if I
made it he'd take me flying.

1014
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,767
He's got no plane.

1015
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,067
You told me had a plane.

1016
01:18:46,067 --> 01:18:50,333
He sold it to pay
for your operation.

1017
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,567
You ok here?

1018
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:07,067
Put your coat on. I'm taking
you out for an early lunch.

1019
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:12,100
[Lisa] I've been to the bank.
They'll loan me the down
payment. What'dya think?

1020
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,433
Can you get it up
in the air?

1021
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:15,067
[Art] Well uh, it'll
take a little work.

1022
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:19,833
I gotta stick the wing back
on and we'll pick up a new
engine but...

1023
01:19:19,867 --> 01:19:22,067
oh hell yes I
can do it.

1024
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:27,167
Then we'll do it. As long as
it takes. You promised.

1025
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,733
Promised what?

1026
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,800
You promised my husband
a plane ride.

1027
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:35,067
* [light-hearted music]

1028
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:38,600
[Eric] Go on.

1029
01:19:40,433 --> 01:19:43,967
[Art] There we go. A little up,
a little more to your left.

1030
01:19:44,067 --> 01:19:46,867
[Lisa] All right.

1031
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:50,533
Ok, good. Now just hold
her there darling.

1032
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:52,500
How long do I have
to hold this?

1033
01:19:52,533 --> 01:19:56,133
Oh, hour, two.

1034
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:06,867
[Eric] Get down!
[speaks inaudibly]

1035
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,400
[clink]

1036
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:24,900
[laughter]

1037
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:55,067
Eric, have you seen my
carving knife, the
serrated one!

1038
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,567
Honey are you in
the bathroom!

1039
01:21:02,467 --> 01:21:05,867
Eric! Honey are--

1040
01:21:06,933 --> 01:21:10,900
Lisa, she just dropped by. It
was a surprise.

1041
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:16,133
She lose her voice? My God, I
thought you had another attack.

1042
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:20,500
I'm surprised you didn't call
Art with the good news.

1043
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:22,667
[Lisa] Sarah you're
being childish.

1044
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,067
Is everyone else in town
being childish too?

1045
01:21:26,067 --> 01:21:28,867
Dad says not even Vivian
talks to you anymore.

1046
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,400
All I care about is your father.
He misses you and Bruce.

1047
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,500
-I'm here aren't I?
-So am I.

1048
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:39,800
Yeah well, I don't insist on
bringing my lover with me
when I come.

1049
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,900
-Some day you'll understand.
-* [dramatic music]

1050
01:21:41,933 --> 01:21:45,433
That my mother was attracted to
greasy finger nails?

1051
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:48,600
Why every wife has to
invent her own life.

1052
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:52,400
Even if that means
torturing your own husband?

1053
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:58,733
I'm staying with your father
because he asked me to and
because I love him.

1054
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:00,833
Art makes me able
to do that.

1055
01:22:00,867 --> 01:22:02,867
You admit that?

1056
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:10,433
That's what you don't
understand. Love for two men.

1057
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,500
There's a name for
women who do that.

1058
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:15,933
Huh?

1059
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:22,133
* [dramatic music]

1060
01:22:40,933 --> 01:22:46,067
Ok, today's the day.
Outside, both of you.

we're going flying.

-[Lisa] There it is.
-* [playful music]

1064
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,967
[Eric] That looks great.

1065
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:03,100
Oh hey no wheelchair.

1066
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:05,967
You said I had to walk
and I'm gonna walk.

1067
01:24:06,067 --> 01:24:09,333
Here take that. This thing
doesn't even look used.

1068
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:11,967
[Art] Well Lisa sanded
every inch of it.

1069
01:24:12,067 --> 01:24:15,567
[Eric] I don't know. An airplane
just doesn't seem like the ideal
do-it-yourself project.

1070
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,133
[laughing]

1071
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:18,933
We sure this
things gonna fly?

1072
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:22,067
[Art] No not really. We'll
find out. [laughing]

1073
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:23,800
[Eric] So where are you
taking me tonight?

1074
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:26,167
[Art] Lisa and I wanna show
you something special.

1075
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,267
[Eric] You're not gonna throw me
out or anything are you?

1076
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,367
[Art] No. Not that it
hasn't occurred to us.

1077
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,433
[Eric] Ok.

1078
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:32,267
-[Art] Ready?
-[Eric] Yeah.

1079
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,633
-[Art] Fingers and toes.
-[Eric] Ok.

1080
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:40,233
* [inspirational music]

1081
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:44,867
[Eric] Wow!

1082
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,167
[Lisa] Isn't this spectacular?

1083
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:53,333
This is damn special. Worth
everyone of those steps. I
think.

1084
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:54,933
We thought of it on
our first date.

1085
01:24:54,967 --> 01:24:56,800
Oh please, give
me break.

1086
01:24:56,833 --> 01:25:00,500
Ok not exactly the first date
but later when things changed,

1087
01:25:00,533 --> 01:25:02,067
we knew we had to
show it to you.

1088
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:06,533
Yeah, yeah. You just needed
someone to hold the stick
while you two neck.

1089
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:09,667
Not a bad idea. Come
on, take over.

1090
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,733
Ha ha ha ha. Hey straighten it
out. Straighten it out!

1091
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:14,767
[Eric] Art! Art!

1092
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,533
[laughter]

1093
01:25:16,567 --> 01:25:19,500
Ok let go, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

1094
01:25:19,533 --> 01:25:24,100
Eric it was never right
without you. [laughter]

[Art sighs]

1097
01:25:46,533 --> 01:25:51,167
Hey, how about you and me go see
if the mail's come in?

1098
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,867
You go.

1099
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,533
Wanna drive me tomorrow. Get
a racing form.

1100
01:26:02,267 --> 01:26:04,467
Bring one
back for me.

1101
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:09,100
Oh come on you're acting
like an old geezer.

1102
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,167
Old geezer's have a way of
knowing when it's time.

1103
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,400
[Art laughs]

1104
01:26:24,433 --> 01:26:31,867
You keep an eye on those
falls for me, will you buddy?

01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,700
[Art crying]

1106
01:26:32,733 --> 01:26:36,067
We have to go to the
hospital now.

1107
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:44,500
[Eric] Thanks.

1108
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:47,833
[Lisa] I haven't
finished yet.

1109
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:53,800
[Eric] For giving me six
months longer than I had
any reason to expect.

1110
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,233
[Lisa] You know why
cannibals don't eat clowns?

1111
01:27:00,267 --> 01:27:02,067
[Eric] No, why?

1112
01:27:02,067 --> 01:27:04,567
[Lisa] They taste funny.

1113
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,733
[Eric laughs]

1114
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,433
I could always
make you smile.

1115
01:27:15,767 --> 01:27:18,533
Someday when you
and Sarah are

1116
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,600
watching our
grandchildren play,

1117
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:24,733
you tell her something.

1118
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,633
Tell her that she
and Bruce

1119
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:34,900
and all the others
that cut us off,

1120
01:27:34,933 --> 01:27:38,633
they really
missed something.

1121
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:46,467
They missed a chance at one
percent of what we had.

1122
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:55,700
I'm glad you have
somebody to love.

1123
01:27:55,733 --> 01:28:02,467
And I'm, I'm so sorry I'm
such a lousy husband.

1124
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:12,800
You were the best husband,
for so many years.

1125

* [sad music]

1126
01:28:14,067 --> 01:28:22,400
You were a great father.
The kids are going to be
just fine.

1127
01:28:22,433 --> 01:28:27,967
In seventy six, you made
me laugh. [laughing]

1128
01:28:28,067 --> 01:28:37,800
Remember the one about
the wand and the donut
holes. [laughing]

1129
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:43,167
It took guts
all of it.

1130
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,067
A life in
the movies.

1131
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:51,833
Living the way we have.
Making it to the mailbox.

1132
01:28:51,867 --> 01:28:55,967
The mailbox.
You're crazy.

1133
01:28:56,067 --> 01:29:00,367
No. No, I'm
not crazy.

1134
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,633
I love you.

1135

I love you too.

I was thinking something simple.
A pasta, with one of your dad's
