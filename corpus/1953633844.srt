1
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,380
When I cast my mind back
to that summer of 1936...

2
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,540
different kinds of memories
offer themselves to me.

3
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:21,021
We got our first wireless set
that summer.

4
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,621
Well, a sort of a set.

5
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,260
And it obsessed us.

6
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:28,861
We called it Lugh" after
the old pagan god of the harvest.

7
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,901
His festival was Lughnasa,
a time of music and dance.

8
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,662
Then my mother's brother,
my Uncle Jack...

9
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:40,422
came home from Africa for
the first time in 25 years.

10
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,302
He was the oldest of the family,
and the only boy.

11
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,422
That was my mother.

12
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:51,022
She was the baby
of the family.

13
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,342
I'm gonna throw
this old cracked thing out.

14
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:56,463
You are not.
I broke it.

15
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,743
The only way to avoid seven years'
bad luck is to keep usin' it.

16
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,223
You know, I think I might
just start to wear lipstick.

17
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:06,223
Steady on there. Today, it's lipstick.
Tomorrow it's the gin bottle.

18
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:15,664
Oh, dear, a wild Woodbine.
It's better than any man.

19
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,064
Not that I'd know.

20
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:20,144
Better not let Kate
hear that kind of chat.

21
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,865
If Aunt Maggie smoked
and took life lightly...

22
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:25,224
Aunt Kate did not.

23
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,465
She was a schoolteacher,
and a strict one.

24
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:30,224
- What are you doing up there?
- I'm putting the finishing touches on.

25
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:33,504
- You should've done that yesterday.
- I want it to look nice for Jack.

26
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:36,665
Get yourself ready. Do you want
the whole place laughing at us?

27
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,785
- I've only to put on a skirt.
- Do so, please.

28
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:41,346
And do something with your hair
as well. Where's Rose?

29
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,785
Feeding the chickens.

30
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:45,706
I suppose she looks like
a mad woman as well.

31
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,186
My mother used to whisper,
"Agnes is deep. "

32
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,546
She says little.

33
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,066
That's Aunt Rose.
Rose was a bit slow.

34
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:57,986
Simple. "
That's the word we used.

35
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,747
Mussolini will be there
with his airplanes in the air

36
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:04,187
Will you come to Abyssinia
Will you come

37
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,467
Mussolini is many miles away.

38
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,467
Father Jack, your only brother,
will be in Ballybeg in one hour.

39
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,747
Would you please
make yourself presentable?

40
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:17,587
Don't mind her.
She's only an old gander.

41
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,027
Gander!

42
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:28,028
And so we set out
to meet my Uncle Jack.

43
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,948
Little did I know it...

44
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,628
child as I was...

45
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,588
that this was the beginning
of things changing.

46
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,309
Changing so quickly.
Too quickly.

47
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,189
- Excited?
- I am, Mammy.

48
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,509
Come on.

49
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,550
Good day, Miss Mundy.

50
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,511
Well, Miss Mundy.
Big day for youse all.

51
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,631
Father Jack,
back at long last.

52
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,791
It is indeed.
Thank you very much.

53
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:20,871
Something for youse all
to be proud of.

54
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:25,631
All that time amongst the lepers.
The man's a saint.

55
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:29,912
Thank you. Bus'll be in soon.
If you'll excuse us.

56
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,871
Give him our best wishes.

57
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:36,032
Give him your arse
and say it's parsley.

58
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,992
That's enough, Margaret,
thank you very much.

59
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:52,552
- Look, it's Danny Bradley.
- Hold your tongue.

60
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:54,633
Will I run over to say hello?

61
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:57,553
You'll stay right here
beside me.

62
00:06:58,553 --> 00:06:59,913
He's a scut.

63
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,034
With three children.
The whole town knows it.

64
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:07,913
You're a fine one to talk,
Christina Mundy.

65
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,793
You're jealous!

66
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,074
That's what's wrong with
the whole lot of youse!

67
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:15,355
- You're jealous of me!
- Just try to control yourself, please.

68
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:18,234
His wife left him.
She did the runner.

69
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,394
She may have had her reasons.

70
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,555
It's coming!
The bus, it's coming!

71
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,395
Oh, Jack.
Oh, thank God, Jack.

72
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,516
Ballybeg. Ten minutes.

73
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,996
Father.

74
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:05,677
- Is this...
- Ballybeg.

75
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:08,677
- Is this the name of where...
- It's where you come from.

76
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,237
- Am I home?
- You're home, Jack.

77
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,238
Mother is dead.

78
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,317
She's not here.
She's dead.

79
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,598
Come on.
Come and say hello to Maggie.

80
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:29,399
- Maggie.
- He's an old man, Mammy.

81
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,041
Come on, Michael.

82
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,480
Stop it, Aunt Maggie.

83
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,842
His sisters loved Jack
with all their hearts...

84
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:49,123
sending what pennies they had
to him in Africa.

85
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:52,403
Rose and Agnes knitting gloves
for a living.

86
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,923
All the women trying
to keep house and home together.

87
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,365
A miracle.

88
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:30,165
That's no miracle.
It is science.

89
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:33,965
It's not science.
It's the god of Lughnasa.

90
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:37,205
Pagan nonsense celebrating
the feast of Lughnasa.

91
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:40,806
This is the month of August, the feast
of Our Lady's Assumption Into Heaven.

92
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,126
A goddess, rising through
the sky and the stars...

93
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:46,806
in search for her dear son.

94
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,127
Where is Michael's father?

95
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,487
He's not here.

96
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,246
They're not married.

97
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,967
So Michael is a love child.

98
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,887
A son conceived in love.

99
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,567
I'm glad you have a child
conceived in love.

100
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:06,607
He's not mine.
He's Christina's.

101
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:08,327
- He's mine.
- All of you.

102
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:11,128
You all love him.
He belongs to all of you.

103
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,528
Michael, go outside and play.

104
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:26,529
Danny Bradley
wants to marry me.

105
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:33,649
He wants to take me up to
the back hills one day to Lough Anna.

106
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,289
Will you marry us?

107
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,569
Danny Bradley can't marry you.
He's married already.

108
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,250
You know that.

109
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:43,490
But he loves me, and I love him.

110
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,930
- And his wife's left him.
- That's not our business.

111
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,690
You must be tired.
Have a wee sleep before you eat.

112
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,850
- It'll build up an appetite.
- In Africa, we sleep and dream.

113
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,051
- In the dream, we sacrifice to the gods.
- This is not Africa.

114
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,090
This is Ballybeg.
Your home.

115
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:03,211
This is Donegal.
This is Ireland.

116
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,451
Another miracle.

117
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,051
It is not a miracle.
It is science.

118
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,451
It's music.
Dance with me, Mother.

119
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:16,652
No... Look, turn that off.
I'll do it myself.

120
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:22,131
I am not your mother.

121
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:25,372
I am Kate, your eldest sister, and
you're going to bed for a short while.

122
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:36,332
The only miracles
are those God ordains.

123
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:39,613
And you are an ordained priest.
You do not dance.

124
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:46,013
Maggie, see Jack to his rest,
if you please.

125
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,493
My rest, yeah.

126
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:56,413
Many women in Africa have love children.
And they are loved.

127
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:58,814
- As they are here.
- Yes, as they are here.

128
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:01,294
I didn't mean to upset you.

129
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:04,574
I would like you all
to have a love child.

130
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:06,854
His Holiness, the Pope, would have
something to say against that.

131
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,014
Yes, he would.

132
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:11,015
But he's never lived in Africa.

133
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,695
I'll put you to your bed.
You need the rest.

134
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:16,535
If His Holiness, the Pope,
doesn't fancy his stay in Africa...

135
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,095
I could take his place.

136
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:20,895
The sisters here will tell ya I've been
looking for a beautiful black man.

137
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,935
Come on, Jack. Bed.

138
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,535
A wee rest.

139
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:30,296
I have to laugh at you,
Christina Mundy.

140
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:34,136
Whenever you say you've to laugh at me,
I know you're not laughing.

141
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:37,616
And I've to say I have
to laugh at you, Rose Mundy.

142
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,656
A brother home
from the foreign missions.

143
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,896
A priest,
confronted by one sister...

144
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,536
who's given birth
to an illegitimate child.

145
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,896
And Rose...

146
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:52,256
talkin' about men
separated from their wives.

147
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,497
I was talkin' about Danny Bradley.

148
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,538
He loves me, Kate!

149
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:58,898
Love?

150
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:03,457
Gander! Gander!

151
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:06,017
That's what you're called
in your classroom.

152
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,098
You're not even a woman.
You're called a gander.

153
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:13,298
I am woman enough
to know what modesty is.

154
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:16,938
A woman's modesty is everything.

155
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,739
Thank you, Okawa.

156
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,820
Who is Okawa?

157
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,500
You are.

158
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,420
She's right, you know. Kate's right.
I brought shame on this family.

159
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,020
- Deep shame.
- You brought Michael to this family.

160
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,741
And he is not shame.
You know that, as does Kate.

161
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,500
What's wrong with Jack?

162
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,621
- His nerves.
- Oh, aye, nerves.

163
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,581
We were so proud of him.

164
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,422
To have a priest in the family was
a great honor. Poor Jack. God help him.

165
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,942
Maybe Michael will become a priest.

166
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,262
Maybe.

167
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:23,702
You could love Uganda, Maggie.

168
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,103
As I lie myself down to sleep...

169
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:31,662
I pray to God my soul to keep.

170
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:34,182
If I should die before I wake...

171
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:36,263
I pray to God my soul to take.

172
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,183
I think I've come home to die.

173
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,903
Jesus, don't.
We can't afford to bury ya.

174
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,863
I'm glad you're home.

175
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,903
Watch yourself.

176
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:51,343
- Go to sleep.
- Aye.

177
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,824
Watch yourself.
Go to sleep, Okawa.

178
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,904
What does Okawa mean?

179
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:58,864
Okawa is my houseboy
in Uganda.

180
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:00,984
He is Okawa.

181
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:04,065
Damn it. I thought
it was Swahili for "gorgeous."

182
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:55,947
Am I called 'the gander"?

183
00:16:58,507 --> 00:17:00,267
No, Aunt Kate.

184
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,747
Who calls me "'the gander"?

185
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,908
The big fellas do.

186
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,189
And you let 'em.

187
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,309
Why have you no friends?

188
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,789
You're another gander.

189
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,029
Aren't you, son?

190
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,630
I've brought you this.
I was saving it for your birth day...

191
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,630
but you might as well have it now.

192
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,591
Do you know how it goes?

193
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,950
Here. You pump it.

194
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,630
Push it down.
Push it.

195
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,230
That's it.

196
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,992
Sacred Heart of Jesus!
I don't believe it.

197
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,352
What's wrong?

198
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,671
That's him. That's Christina's man!
That's Gerry.

199
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,152
It's Gerry Evans!

200
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:13,392
He's not coming in this house.

201
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,592
When are we gonna get a decent mirror
to see ourselves in?

202
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:20,592
- You can see enough to do you.
- You're not going to meet that blaggard!

203
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,553
I couldn't look that man
in the face.

204
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:23,952
I hate him.
I hate him!

205
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,112
Look at my hands shakin'.

206
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:33,353
You're not shaking.
You're perfectly calm.

207
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,513
You're looking beautiful.
And what you're gonna do is this:

208
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:40,193
You'll meet him outside. Tell him
that his son is healthy and happy.

209
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:42,153
- Then you'll send him packing.
- No.

210
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,594
He can stay the night.

211
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:45,794
In the shed, outside.

212
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,234
Alone.

213
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:55,714
Come on.

214
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:30,276
Oh, look at her.

215
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:41,997
Hello, Chrissie.

216
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:44,677
Hello, Gerry.

217
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:49,317
How have you been
over the past 18 months?

218
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,757
Eighteen? Never.

219
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:56,117
March, last year.
March the sixth.

220
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,758
Where does the time go?

221
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:05,558
- Well, you're here now.
- Here I am.

222
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,479
Wonderful luck.

223
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,318
Is that himself?

224
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:19,799
- He's a big boy.
- He's grown well.

225
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,239
- Does he like school?
- He doesn't say much.

226
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,239
Like his Aunt Kate.

227
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,920
Yes, indeed.

228
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,839
Will someone please tell me
what they have to say to each other?

229
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,200
He's Michael's father.

230
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,360
That's a responsibility
never burdened Mr. Evans.

231
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:48,401
A commercial traveler called in
to Kate's school last Easter.

232
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,921
Met you in Dublin.
Had some stupid story...

233
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,721
about you givin'
dancing lessons up there.

234
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,641
He was right.

235
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,562
- He was not.
- Cross the old ticker.

236
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,481
All last winter.

237
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,762
Strictly ballroom.

238
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:05,561
Millions of pupils.

239
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:08,082
- Everybody wants to dance.
- Millions of pupils?

240
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,041
Fifty-three.
I'm a liar. Fifty-one.

241
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:13,963
When the good weather came,
they all drifted away.

242
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,123
You're the one should've been
giving dance lessons.

243
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:18,402
You were far better
than me, remember?

244
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:23,683
'Twas on the Isle of Capri
that he found her

245
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:28,843
Beneath the shade
of an old walnut tree

246
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,883
And, oh, how the flowers
bloomed around her

247
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:37,204
Where they met
on the Isle of Capri

248
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:39,884
All he could ever do was dance.

249
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:45,884
Her whole face alters
when she's happy.

250
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:49,004
Though he left
with the tide in the morning

251
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:52,084
Still his heart's
in the Isle of Capri

252
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:58,365
What brings you
to these parts now?

253
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:00,324
To say good-bye.

254
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,645
Where are you heading for?

255
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:06,485
- You'd like to know?
- I would.

256
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,845
Want a spin on this bike?

257
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,525
- I might.
- Get on.

258
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:17,725
- See you soon, Michael.
- Bye, son.

259
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,527
Where are you going next?

260
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:47,527
You'll never believe this.

261
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,768
I'm gonna do a spot of fighting.

262
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:53,408
- What do you know about fightin'?
- I'm a Welshman. We're always fighting.

263
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,128
You're as soft as butter.

264
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,328
- I'm going off to Spain.
- Spain?

265
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:04,928
The International Brigade.
I'm joining up.

266
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,968
I'm gonna fight against Franco.

267
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,048
There's a company leaves
in a couple of weeks.

268
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:12,369
I'm gonna fight for democracy.

269
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:15,649
Democracy? Spain?
What do you know about Spain?

270
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,729
A little.

271
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:19,609
Enough, maybe.

272
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,130
- Why exactly are you going to Spain?
- Because I want to do something.

273
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,690
I want to do anything...
with my life.

274
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,610
I have to.

275
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,050
Well, then do it.

276
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,730
"'Then do it."

277
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:46,051
"Then do it!"

278
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,253
- Morning, Miss Mundy.
- Morning.

279
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:28,574
Thank you, Austin.

280
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:30,653
Thank you, Mrs. Mac.

281
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:38,494
Mrs. McLoughlin.
And how are you?

282
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:42,294
I'm well. I've brought
some more wool for Agnes and Rose.

283
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,934
This might be the last batch
I give 'em, God help us all.

284
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:47,615
Dear me, Vera.
What's wrong?

285
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,694
Isn't Agnes the quickest knitter
in Ballybeg?

286
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,734
You've not heard the word?

287
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:55,015
There's a woolen factory opening up
in Donegal Town, they say.

288
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:56,975
It'll be all machine knittin'
from now on.

289
00:24:57,015 --> 00:25:00,055
- Machines? A factory?
- That's right.

290
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:02,535
You're a lucky woman
to have your teachin' job.

291
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:07,495
There's our Sophia waving to you.
You were her favorite teacher.

292
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:10,215
That old bitch, the gander.

293
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:12,255
Sophia always knew her own mind.

294
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,136
Who are you tellin'?

295
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:17,496
Didn't she walk into the house a week
ago and told me she was gettin' married.

296
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:21,096
Married?
Well, she's barely 16.

297
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:23,816
Married. And I'll let her.

298
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,976
She'll need a man to keep her.

299
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,896
I'll say nothin' to Agnes
about the factory.

300
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:30,056
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

301
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,938
- Two pounds of flour.
- Thank you.

302
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,899
I better not forget
the cigarettes...

303
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:57,219
or a certain sister of mine
will not speak to me for a week.

304
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:59,178
Maggie enjoys her wild Woodbine.

305
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,259
- Does she not?
- She does indeed.

306
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,979
But God forgive me, I do not think
it's a nice habit in a woman.

307
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,979
Harmless enough pleasure.
Now, have you got everything?

308
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:12,459
Sugar, salt, tapioca... I'm sorry,
the tapioca's gone up a penny.

309
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:15,179
That's hardly your fault.

310
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:19,100
Your battery,
that's come in from Letterkenny.

311
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,379
Oh, yes. Not much good it'll do
in that old set, though.

312
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,460
Will you be going to
the harvest dance this year?

313
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,580
- I hardly think so at my age.
- But you should.

314
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:36,140
It'll be supreme this year.
Supreme.

315
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,061
Will it be?

316
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:43,861
Will it really be supreme?
Tea, soap, Indian meal, jelly.

317
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:47,782
- How much do I owe you?
- Two and six.

318
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:56,662
Mr. Bradley.

319
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,582
Miss Mundy.
How are you?

320
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:01,783
Very well.
And how are you and yours?

321
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:04,623
How is your wife?

322
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:07,782
- I no longer have a wife.
- I hadn't heard she passed away.

323
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:10,863
She's gone away... to England.

324
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:13,583
- You should have followed her there.
- Ten Woodbine.

325
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:15,783
All kinds of things can happen
to a body in England.

326
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:19,983
They're not respectable people there
as we are in Ballybeg.

327
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:23,303
Will your sisters be going
to the dance?

328
00:27:23,384 --> 00:27:25,983
Agnes and Rose.
Will they go?

329
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:34,664
If you'll excuse me, I have a family
and responsibilities to attend to.

330
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:41,824
Will you be going yourself
to the harvest dance?

331
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:44,145
Will you be looking
for a new wife?

332
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:48,065
Do you know what you are?
A dirty, cruel little bitch.

333
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,466
Father Carlin.

334
00:28:07,546 --> 00:28:10,386
- Miss Mundy.
- I'm so glad you asked to see me.

335
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:13,106
Father Jack is waiting
to meet up with you soon.

336
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,426
I didn't ask to see you
about your brother.

337
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:20,867
Well, I was just wonderin'
when you would call out to see him.

338
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:27,307
- He's not well, I hear.
- He's just grand, thank God.

339
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:31,507
Good feeding, plenty of exercise,
he'll be right as rain.

340
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:35,108
The rain.
Aye, that's what he needs.

341
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:37,667
Rain?

342
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,908
The sun in Africa, you know...

343
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:42,507
it would affect anybody.

344
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,548
He needs the rain.
That'll heal him.

345
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:50,708
- He's going to say Mass soon.
- I don't think so.

346
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,869
When he's fit to see people,
I'll call out.

347
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:58,389
He's fit to see anybody.

348
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:00,389
- Jack is...
- Not well.

349
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:03,669
I know.
I know everything about him.

350
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:08,789
- There is nothin' to know.
- I think there is. So do you.

351
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,989
You're a bright enough woman.
You must notice things.

352
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,030
Haven't you noticed the numbers
in the school are falling?

353
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,030
- To be honest, I haven't.
- Well, they have.

354
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:26,830
They have.

355
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:29,430
So I might need
to let a teacher go.

356
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,511
Of course,
that could be all for the best.

357
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,511
I'm sure you could do
with the extra time...

358
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,471
now you have Father Jack
on your hands.

359
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:41,111
Good-bye to you now.

360
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:43,071
But I am a teacher.

361
00:29:43,112 --> 00:29:46,072
What'll I do
if I stop teaching?

362
00:29:56,992 --> 00:29:58,873
What'II become of us?

363
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,633
Good day to you, ma'am.

364
00:30:45,114 --> 00:30:47,355
That's a fine hat.

365
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:50,355
It was a present
from the District Commissioner.

366
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:55,435
He's a stubborn man.
He and I fight a lot, but I like him.

367
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:58,356
He calls me "The Irish Outcast."

368
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:00,556
When I was leaving,
he gave me a present...

369
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:04,236
of the last governor's
ceremonial hat.

370
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:06,236
Well, you must show it to Michael.

371
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:07,836
I will later.

372
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:38,038
He's watching you.
He's shy of you.

373
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:40,398
He'll grow out of it.

374
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:43,038
Are you gonna be here long enough
to give him time to grow out of it?

375
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,678
I'm gonna buy him a bike.

376
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:55,039
You trying to break the child's heart?
A bike's what he's always wanted.

377
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,239
- I will buy him a bike.
- Don't lie to him.

378
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,439
Can I talk to you?

379
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,800
I need to ask you a question.
Will you answer me?

380
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll ask you anyway.
What color do you like best?

381
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,320
Black or blue?

382
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,840
I need to know if I should buy you
a black or a blue bike.

383
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:21,760
Black!

384
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:33,841
Does Mr. Evans ever wonder how
Christina clothes and feeds Michael?

385
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:37,121
Does he ask her?
Does Mr. Evans care?

386
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:39,681
Beasts of the field have more concern
for their young than that creature has.

387
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:43,521
Do you ever listen to yourself?

388
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,922
You are such a damned,
righteous bitch!

389
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:47,642
And his name is Gerry.

390
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:57,362
Don't I know his name is Gerry.

391
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:01,683
What am I calling him, Saint Patrick?
What was that all about?

392
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:04,282
Who's to say?

393
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:11,043
'Twas on the Isle of Capri
that he found her

394
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:14,363
Beneath the shade
of the old walnut tree

395
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:19,364
Oh, I can still see
the flowers blooming 'round her

396
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:22,204
As they met on the Isle of Capri

397
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:25,924
If you knew your prayers as well
as you knew those old pagan songs...

398
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,845
I am a righteous bitch,
aren't I?

399
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:37,125
She was as sweet
as a rose at the dawning

400
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:40,805
But somehow fate
hadn't meant it to be

401
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,405
And as he sailed
with the tide in the morning

402
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:48,286
Still his heart's
in the Isle of Capri

403
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:52,126
- What have you got to sing about?
- Just practicing the fox-trot.

404
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:54,045
- Where is Gerry?
- He's with Michael.

405
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:55,366
What are they doing?

406
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:57,286
His daddy's giving him a ride
on his motorbike.

407
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,366
Motorbike!

408
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:00,766
Motor...
He'll kill the child!

409
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:03,206
He'll be all right.
He's with his daddy.

410
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:20,167
What's wrong? Don't you like
your daddy to kiss you?

411
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,647
- Are you really my daddy?
- You know I am.

412
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,207
You've seen me five or six times.
Don't you remember?

413
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:28,088
- I've never seen you before this week.
- Yes, you have.

414
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,848
Five or six times.
You've forgotten.

415
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:31,687
Maybe so.

416
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,888
Look at those strange animals
over there.

417
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:36,608
What's strange about them?

418
00:34:36,689 --> 00:34:38,528
They've got horns in
the middle of their foreheads.

419
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,609
Do you think they might be unicorns?

420
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:44,488
Unicorns are horses. Those are sheep.
And there's no horns there.

421
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,929
Can we go home now?
I'm hungry.

422
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:49,529
All right.

423
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,449
- What was that for?
- I don't know.

424
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:20,650
I do beg your pardon.

425
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,451
My...
My mind was...

426
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:30,691
- What are those?
- They're roses. Flowers.

427
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:32,692
They won't bite ya.
They're just flowers.

428
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,491
Yes, flowers.

429
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:36,411
We'll put some in your room
for you with a card...

430
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:38,892
under them saying "roses"
so you know what they are.

431
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,812
Have you taken your medicine yet?

432
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:44,172
You're supposed to take it
three times a day, you know that.

433
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:48,012
One of our priests
took too much quinine.

434
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:51,973
He was addicted.
He almost died.

435
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,053
The local medicine man
made him better.

436
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:59,293
There's a strange white bird
on my windowsill.

437
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:00,813
That's Rosie's pet rooster.

438
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,814
- Keep away from that thing.
- One day I'm gonna wring its neck.

439
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:07,173
In Africa,
when we want to please spirits...

440
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:10,614
we kill a rooster or a small goat.

441
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:13,454
What's the word for that called?

442
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:16,414
A ritual...

443
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:21,294
No, ceremony. That's the word
I was searching for.

444
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,375
I'm glad I got that.

445
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,775
Spirits, medicine men,
ritual sacrifices.

446
00:36:33,295 --> 00:36:35,455
His head's completely turned.

447
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:43,415
Here's a special bit for you.

448
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,736
Are youse not hungry?

449
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,936
- Is Gerry eatin' with us?
- He is, I'm sure.

450
00:36:57,016 --> 00:37:00,176
We've only a few eggs left
and some apples.

451
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,416
We'll manage.

452
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,937
You can smell tea
being made a mile away.

453
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:09,097
I can indeed. I saw Michael and Gerry
on the motorbike.

454
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:11,017
I'm gonna ask Gerry
to give me a run on it.

455
00:37:11,097 --> 00:37:13,418
You'll do no such thing.
And why aren't they home yet?

456
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,817
They'll be safe.

457
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:18,418
Is Gerry all right
staying in the barn?

458
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,778
- He's safe staying there.
- Nobody's safe these days.

459
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:23,538
Somebody's landed Austin Morgan.

460
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,578
He's getting married next month.

461
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:29,258
Our Kate was very mad
about Austin Morgan. Look at her.

462
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,378
She's blushin'.

463
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,858
- That's enough.
- And Sofia McLoughlin.

464
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,539
She's to be married.

465
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:38,379
That'll put an end
to her dancin' days.

466
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,899
The other day she had the cheek to ask
if I were going to the harvest dance.

467
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:44,138
She said it would be
supreme this year.

468
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:47,539
Supreme. Think I'm gettin'
corns on this foot.

469
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,019
Hope to God I don't end up crippled
like poor Mother, may she rest in peace.

470
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,259
Wouldn't it be a good one
if we all went?

471
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,580
- Went where?
- To the harvest dance.

472
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:00,179
All dressed up.
I think we should all go.

473
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,900
Have you no idea
what it will be like?

474
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,140
Crawling with cheeky young brats
that I taught years ago.

475
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,220
I'm game.

476
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,541
- You know how I love dancing.
- You have an eight-year-old child.

477
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,621
- Have you forgotten that?
- You can wear that green dress of mine.

478
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,540
You've the figure for it, and it
brings out the color of your eyes.

479
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:20,020
And you look great in that cotton dress
you got for confirmation last year.

480
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:22,901
You're beautiful in it.

481
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:27,381
This is silly talk.
We can't. How can we?

482
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,982
Will you go with us?

483
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:33,422
- Will Maggie what? Try and stop me.
- Oh, God, Agnes. What do you think?

484
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:36,342
- We're going!
- We're off. We're away!

485
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:38,862
- It cost four and six to get in.
- I've five pounds saved.

486
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,782
I'll take you.
I'll take us all.

487
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:44,542
How many years has it been since
we were at a dance in the village?

488
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,903
And I don't care
how young they are.

489
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:50,863
How drunk and dirty and sweaty they are.
I want to dance.

490
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:54,583
It's the festival of Lughnasa.
I want to dance.

491
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,223
I know. I know.

492
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:59,824
It's settled. We're going.

493
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:01,263
Like we used to.

494
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:04,623
I love you, Aggie.
I love you.

495
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:08,023
Will you come to Abyssinia
Will you come

496
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:09,744
Bring your own cup
and a saucer and a bun

497
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,224
Mussolini will be there
with his airplanes in the air

498
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:14,224
Will you come to Abyssinia
Will you come

499
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:19,385
We're going nowhere.
Look at yourselves, will ya?

500
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,784
Mature women... dancing?

501
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:25,345
What's come over you all?

502
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,385
We're going to no harvest dance.

503
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:43,026
And you were going to pay for us all
out of five pounds you saved?

504
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:45,746
I don't see any of that being
offered up for the housekeeping.

505
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,666
That's more than I have!

506
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,586
This isn't your classroom.

507
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:52,586
Maybe I should start
knittin' gloves.

508
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:57,947
I wash every stitch
of clothes you wear.

509
00:39:58,026 --> 00:39:59,867
I polish your shoes.

510
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:03,787
I make your bed.
We both do, Rose and I!

511
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:06,308
Paint the house,
sweep the chimney...

512
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:08,987
cut the grass, save the turf.

513
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:13,348
What you have here
are two unpaid servants.

514
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:17,148
And if you will now
keep your mouth shut...

515
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:19,868
this unpaid servant
will make your tea.

516
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:47,350
Mr. Evans'll be off again...

517
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:49,269
for another 12 months.

518
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,830
Christina will sob and lament
in the middle of the night.

519
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,830
I don't think I could go through
another winter like that.

520
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,030
You work hard at your job.
You try to keep the home together.

521
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,231
Suddenly, you realize
the cracks are appearing everywhere.

522
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,151
- It's all about to collapse.
- Nothing's about to collapse.

523
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,151
But what I'm most worried about
is Rose.

524
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:11,830
If I lose my job,
if this house is broken up...

525
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:13,831
what'll become of our Rosie?

526
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:19,591
Evening, ladies.

527
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:25,792
Look at me, everybody,
on my dad's motorbike!

528
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:51,833
Okawa, I'm coming home.

529
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,633
I'm coming home.

530
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:59,074
You're dreamin'.

531
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:04,634
Come. We'll go for our walk now.

532
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:21,995
What were you doing
with the wooden sticks, Uncle Jack?

533
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:32,195
- Anybody want more tea?
- I'm your man.

534
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:35,196
I was talking to Obi...

535
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:37,595
the Great Goddess of the Earth.

536
00:42:37,676 --> 00:42:39,396
Is she now?

537
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:43,076
At this time of year...
harvesttime in Africa-

538
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:45,956
we celebrate the festival
of the New Yam...

539
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,877
and the festival
of the Sweet Casava.

540
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:51,557
They're both dedicated to Obi,
the Great Goddess of the Earth.

541
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,116
Is there a Saint Obi?

542
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:55,197
If there is,
she's not in my prayer book.

543
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:56,837
How do you celebrate it?

544
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:00,557
Well, we cut...

545
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:02,917
cut and anoint...

546
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:06,118
the new yam
and the new casava.

547
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:09,118
And then we pass the bowl
around the table...

548
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:11,037
and each takes one.

549
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:15,518
We light fires
and we paint our faces.

550
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:19,078
And then we sing
and drink palm wine.

551
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,558
And we dance, and we dance,
and we dance.

552
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:27,399
Men, women and children,
and even lepers with limbs missing.

553
00:43:27,478 --> 00:43:31,759
For days on end, dancing.
You lose all sense of time.

554
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,879
A clatter of lepers
doing the Military Two-Step.

555
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,599
- God forgive you.
- They have a great capacity...

556
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,720
for fun and laughing.

557
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:41,199
You'd love them.
You must come back with me.

558
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:43,679
I don't think I'd be too keen
on the yams.

559
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,399
Think I'd miss the old spud.

560
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,800
These festivals, they're not
Christian ceremonies, are they?

561
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,041
The Ryangans are faithful
to their own religion.

562
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,921
Will you say Mass soon?

563
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,841
In the house, maybe?

564
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:04,881
I will, yes.
Monday, maybe.

565
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:15,201
- Shall I put the wireless on?
- Marconi's in one of his moods.

566
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:17,961
You might have a look at the aerial
one of these days.

567
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,202
Bit of music
would do us all nicely.

568
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,481
No. We must all be worn out.

569
00:44:26,442 --> 00:44:27,562
Good night.

570
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,122
Good night, all.

571
00:44:30,643 --> 00:44:32,642
Can I stay with Daddy
in the barn?

572
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:37,443
Please, Mum, I want to.

573
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:41,243
Tonight, we will all sleep
in our own beds.

574
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:43,563
And that is final.

575
00:44:45,843 --> 00:44:47,683
I'll see you in the morning.

576
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:56,444
Come on.
I'll put you to your bed.

577
00:44:56,523 --> 00:44:58,884
I'll be in to read to you
in five minutes.

578
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:03,404
No. He'll go straight to sleep tonight.
And that too is final.

579
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:27,966
Gypsy, play your violin

580
00:45:28,045 --> 00:45:30,885
The moon is high above

581
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:35,086
I'll fly to you
on silver wings

582
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:38,446
The serenade I love

583
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,890
What's the matter?

584
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:37,330
Do you ever want to go away?

585
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,010
Why?

586
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,129
Just wanted away?

587
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,330
Danny Bradley's asked me
to go away.

588
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,410
To America.

589
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,570
Danny Bradley is no good for you.

590
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:56,690
He wants to take me to a picnic,
out at Lough Anna. Look...

591
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:00,691
what he gave me.

592
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:14,132
I haven't worn it yet.

593
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:18,131
I'm keeping it for when we go
out on the boat.

594
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:22,292
You're not going.
Promise me you're not.

595
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:26,732
Do you hear me?

596
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,093
I hear ya.

597
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:37,173
I love you. I love you
more than chocolate biscuits.

598
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,693
I love you too.

599
00:47:49,774 --> 00:47:53,614
If you ever do go away,
you'll take me with you, won't you?

600
00:47:53,694 --> 00:47:56,574
I promise.

601
00:47:56,654 --> 00:47:58,574
But it's to be our secret.

602
00:47:58,654 --> 00:48:00,054
Promise?

603
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,537
That lovely summer
I thought would never end.

604
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,337
We laughed and played
to our heart's content.

605
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:55,938
And I was king of the castle,
surrounded by all who loved me.

606
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:58,898
Come on, then. Catch.

607
00:49:24,939 --> 00:49:26,899
Jesus, look at me.
Look at the cut of me.

608
00:49:26,979 --> 00:49:29,339
I thought my hair was lovely.
It's like a whin bush.

609
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,780
- You were lovely.
- God forgive you for mocking.

610
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,420
- Who's that?
- Curly McDaid, God rest him.

611
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Curly? He hasn't a hair
on his head.

612
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,100
Bald at 17.
That's why we called him Curly.

613
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,700
Your sister could tell you
a thing or two about him.

614
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,261
- Tell all.
- My lips are sealed.

615
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:52,061
Mine are not. He had a few
wild notions about our Kate.

616
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,221
I had no more interest in Curly McDaid
than the man in the moon.

617
00:49:56,261 --> 00:50:00,221
- He was fair mad about her.
- If we're talking about wild notions...

618
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:03,942
What about him?

619
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,981
Brian McGuinness.

620
00:50:06,062 --> 00:50:09,222
- He's gorgeous.
- Your sister thought so too.

621
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:13,142
He was a bit like Gerry.
The loveliest dancer.

622
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:16,222
Do you mind the time
you were robbed?

623
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:19,423
- That dance competition?
- You were there.

624
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:23,422
I do remember that night.
They had a waltz competition.

625
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:25,903
I was looking down
at Curly McDaid's bald head.

626
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:29,623
But Maggie and Brian
were so beautiful.

627
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:31,823
Of course, they gave the cup
to the two old ones.

628
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,063
You should have won,
you and Brian.

629
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:38,943
- What happened to him?
- Brian went to Australia.

630
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:44,024
He wrote. I answered.
Australia's far away.

631
00:50:44,104 --> 00:50:45,943
The way things go.

632
00:50:46,024 --> 00:50:49,504
So that's that.

633
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:52,224
Will somebody give us a song?

634
00:50:52,304 --> 00:50:56,064
Rose Mundy, I call on you.
Down By The Salley Gardens."

635
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:04,545
Down by the Salley Gardens

636
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:10,105
My love and I did meet

637
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:16,066
She passed the Salley Gardens

638
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:20,986
With little snow-white feet

639
00:51:21,066 --> 00:51:26,946
She bid me take love easy

640
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:31,946
As the leaves grow on a tree

641
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:37,827
But I being young and foolish

642
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:43,067
With her could not agree

643
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:48,708
In a field down by the river

644
00:51:48,747 --> 00:51:53,828
My love and I did stand

645
00:51:53,868 --> 00:51:59,228
And on my leaning shoulder

646
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:03,949
She laid her snow-white hand

647
00:52:04,028 --> 00:52:09,548
She bid me take life easy

648
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:13,748
As the grass grows on the weir

649
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:19,990
But I was young and foolish

650
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:24,789
And now I'm full of tear

651
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,471
Good morning.

652
00:52:50,551 --> 00:52:54,151
- Do you fancy a stroll by the river?
- I'll be right after you.

653
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:07,272
Where's your mammy?

654
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:10,712
She's not up yet.
She's wild tired.

655
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:14,432
Are you getting something
ready for school?

656
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:16,233
I'm not listenin'.

657
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:20,912
Gypsy, play your violin

658
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:23,553
The moon is high above

659
00:53:23,593 --> 00:53:26,553
I'll fly to you
on silver wings

660
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,233
That serenade our love

661
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:30,753
Look what you've made me do.
You've ruined my letter.

662
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,714
Whoever you're writing to, he'd need
to be smart to read that scrawl.

663
00:53:34,793 --> 00:53:36,074
Santa Claus.

664
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,874
In August?
At the feast of Lughnasa?

665
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:41,794
Nothing like gettin' him
before the rush.

666
00:53:43,114 --> 00:53:45,434
- What are you asking for?
- A bell.

667
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,754
- A bell?
- For my bicycle.

668
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:49,114
Bicycle?

669
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:51,835
The one my daddy's buying me
in Kilkenny.

670
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:54,555
He promised me.

671
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:57,874
Well, if he promised you,
aren't you the lucky boy?

672
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,995
Away and write to Santa Claus
some other time. Go on.

673
00:54:02,035 --> 00:54:06,315
A day like today, you should be running
about the fields like a young calf.

674
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:09,715
I'm not a calf.
I'm Michael, Michael Evans.

675
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:40,957
That's a fine hat.

676
00:54:41,037 --> 00:54:43,118
Your own is very impressive as well.

677
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,877
We must do a swap
before I go back to Africa.

678
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,717
- You're going back?
- I may. Soon.

679
00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:56,398
- God, I enjoyed that sleep.
- Aren't you the lucky one?

680
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:00,198
Where's Michael?

681
00:55:00,278 --> 00:55:03,918
Outside, dreaming
he's on his new bicycle.

682
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,798
You never know.
Gerry might buy it.

683
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:10,759
It's a good thing Michael is blessed
with a great imagination.

684
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,040
- Is there water boiling for tea?
- There will be.

685
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,719
And soda bread.
If Agnes and Rose...

686
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:19,999
have luck with the blackberries,
we should have some beautiful jam.

687
00:55:20,919 --> 00:55:23,079
- They're pickin' blackberries?
- They are.

688
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,760
Rose in her Sunday best
for some reason.

689
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,320
- Did you hear what I said to Maggie?
- I did.

690
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,201
She said, '"Well, you're a fine lady
to go out pickin' blackberries."

691
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:44,560
And you said, "I'm some toff, Maggie.
I'm some toff."

692
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:49,361
Well, stop bein' such a toff
and give me a hand.

693
00:55:49,401 --> 00:55:50,641
All right.

694
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:56,882
Is that all the sympathy I get?

695
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,922
Now pull me out.

696
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:04,682
Look at me hands,
all scrabbed with briars.

697
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,083
What's that?

698
00:56:25,163 --> 00:56:28,083
It's a church bell, I think.
You should know.

699
00:56:28,164 --> 00:56:30,084
Yes, I should.

700
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:33,083
Now, what's our direction?

701
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:37,444
I want to know exactly where I'm going,
then Kate won't have to nag.

702
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:41,164
- Nag. That's not a word, is it?
- Nag? Yes. To keep on at somebody.

703
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:45,044
Oh, good. Nag.
My English is coming back.

704
00:56:45,124 --> 00:56:46,964
- Do you speak Spanish?
- Spanish?

705
00:56:47,045 --> 00:56:50,325
- For Spain.
- No. Not a word.

706
00:56:50,364 --> 00:56:53,365
I can ride a motorbike.
That'll be enough to get me signed on.

707
00:56:54,805 --> 00:56:56,245
I take it you don't approve.

708
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,325
Why?

709
00:56:58,405 --> 00:57:02,006
I'm going to fight against Franco,
the Catholic Church and all that.

710
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,405
The Catholic Church.

711
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:06,285
- Are they for Franco?
- Yes.

712
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:08,366
They would be.

713
00:57:08,445 --> 00:57:10,325
You're sharper than you seem.

714
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:12,365
Am I?

715
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:16,366
Those church bells?
Were they ringing tor a wedding?

716
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:19,687
Will they ever ring
for you and Christina?

717
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:24,407
Good.

718
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:27,887
Better to leave her single
than to leave her married.

719
00:57:46,808 --> 00:57:49,568
I've a wild pain in my stomach,
and my head's splittin'.

720
00:57:49,648 --> 00:57:51,048
That's hit you very sudden.

721
00:57:53,129 --> 00:57:56,089
Must be that hot sun.

722
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:58,569
Maybe you should go home
and have a wee rest.

723
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:01,288
Aye. I think I will.

724
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:06,369
- Go straight home.
- I will! Aye.

725
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:49,171
Rosebud.

726
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:54,692
You'll never go away, will ya?

727
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:02,412
Did you bring anything to eat?

728
00:59:02,492 --> 00:59:05,452
You said we'd have a picnic,
and I could eat a horse.

729
00:59:13,893 --> 00:59:16,293
Chocolate biscuits.

730
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:18,214
The very boys.

731
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:34,334
I don't know why
I'm goin' to Spain.

732
00:59:35,294 --> 00:59:37,654
Everybody says
it'll be over by Christmas.

733
00:59:37,694 --> 00:59:40,374
They said the Great War
would be over by Christmas.

734
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:44,375
They say that about all wars.
Never are though.

735
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,815
It's for the cause.

736
00:59:48,055 --> 00:59:50,655
There's bound to be something
right about the cause.

737
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:55,015
It's somewhere to go.
Spain.

738
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:56,335
Isn't it?

739
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:04,656
There's Agnes over there.

740
01:00:17,776 --> 01:00:19,936
You're an eejit of a man,
Gerry Evans.

741
01:00:23,937 --> 01:00:27,417
There now.
You're even more beautiful.

742
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,177
A right glamour girl.

743
01:00:30,337 --> 01:00:33,738
Pretty milkmaid,
put down your pails...

744
01:00:33,817 --> 01:00:35,697
and dance with me.

745
01:00:35,778 --> 01:00:39,058
- Would you have a bit of sense?
- Dance with me, please. Come on.

746
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:40,258
Give me your hand.

747
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:49,379
In olden days
a glimpse of stocking

748
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,898
Was looked at
as something shocking

749
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:54,139
And heaven knows

750
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:57,178
Anything goes

751
01:00:58,179 --> 01:01:01,899
Good authors too
who once knew better words

752
01:01:01,979 --> 01:01:06,339
Now only use four-letter words
writing prose

753
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:08,779
Anything goes

754
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:35,261
But I know you're not responsible
for Gerry's decisions...

755
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:37,741
but I just feel it would be on
my consciousness if I didn't tell ya...

756
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:41,821
how strongly I disapprove of this whole
International Brigade caper in Spain.

757
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:42,901
Would it?

758
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:46,462
Its a sorry day in Ireland when we send
men off to fight for godless Communism.

759
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,862
And I know he would say
it's for democracy.

760
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,342
- Would he?
- I'm not going to argue.

761
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:53,342
- I just want to clear my conscience.
- Now you've cleared it.

762
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:55,942
Good for you.

763
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,863
Did you enjoy them biscuits, Rose?

764
01:02:01,902 --> 01:02:03,782
I did, Danny. Thank you.

765
01:02:04,943 --> 01:02:06,823
Is that all I'm going to get?

766
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,983
It is, yes.

767
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:15,223
When my wife left me,
I came out here to Lough Anna.

768
01:02:15,304 --> 01:02:17,344
To go out in the boat?

769
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:19,904
No. To the water.

770
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:21,624
To throw myself in.

771
01:02:22,984 --> 01:02:25,224
But I didn't.

772
01:02:28,784 --> 01:02:31,745
There's a dance tonight in
the back hills. Will you come with me?

773
01:02:35,864 --> 01:02:38,785
I have to go home.
They'll be worried.

774
01:02:41,704 --> 01:02:43,625
Are you worried?

775
01:02:49,785 --> 01:02:51,385
Are you?

776
01:02:59,386 --> 01:03:01,066
Will you come with me
to the dance tonight?

777
01:03:01,106 --> 01:03:04,266
Yes, I will.
Please, will you stop this?

778
01:03:11,307 --> 01:03:13,147
I'll get back to dry land.

779
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:17,667
And you won't leave me.

780
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:19,947
You won't.

781
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:34,948
Is that a purple stain
on your gansey?

782
01:03:34,988 --> 01:03:38,508
I fell into a bush.
Rosie nearly died laughin' at me.

783
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:41,469
How is she now?
Is she still in bed?

784
01:03:41,548 --> 01:03:43,148
Bed?

785
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:46,349
She's here, isn't she?
She left me and went home to lie down.

786
01:03:46,428 --> 01:03:49,069
She said she wasn't feeling well.

787
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,149
Have you seen Rose?

788
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:03,949
When did she leave you?

789
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,189
Three hours ago.
She said she felt out of sorts.

790
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,110
And she set off on her own
to come home?

791
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:10,630
That's what she said.

792
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:13,350
Start at the beginning, Agnes.
What exactly happened?

793
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:16,350
Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

794
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:20,591
We walked to the bushes
and out of the blue she said...

795
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:22,871
- I've forgotten what she said.
- Think.

796
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,751
She said something
about the warm sun...

797
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:28,191
and she had a sore head
and a sick stomach.

798
01:04:28,271 --> 01:04:32,071
She'd go home and sleep for a while.
Are you sure she's not in her bed?

799
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:35,432
Where is she?
What's happening to our Rosie?

800
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:38,351
Stop sniveling.
Did she go towards home?

801
01:04:38,392 --> 01:04:39,951
I think so. Yes.

802
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:43,152
- She may have gone into the town.
- Not wearing Wellingtons.

803
01:04:43,232 --> 01:04:45,192
She was wearing
her good shoes...

804
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:48,912
and her blue cardigan
and her good skirt.

805
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:51,432
- Danny Bradley.
- What?

806
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:54,833
- Oh, God, no.
- Danny. Lough Anna. The back hills.

807
01:04:54,912 --> 01:04:59,593
What about the back hills? What do
you know about this Bradley business?

808
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:02,833
- I know no more than any of you!
- You and Rose always whisper together.

809
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:05,353
What plot has been hatched
between Rose and Mr. Bradley?

810
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:07,473
- No plot, Kate, please!
- You're lyin' to me, Agnes!

811
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:11,353
- You're withholdin'. I want the truth.
- All I know is what I have...

812
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:13,393
- I want to know everything you know!
- That'll do, Kate!

813
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:15,874
Will you stop that at once?

814
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,754
She may well be in the town.
She may be on her way home.

815
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:22,194
She may have fainted
if she wasn't feelin' well.

816
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:25,754
We're going to find her.

817
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,954
You search the fields
on the upper side of the lane.

818
01:05:27,994 --> 01:05:30,995
You take the lower side
down as far as the main road.

819
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:34,795
Kate, you go to the old well
and search all around there.

820
01:05:40,915 --> 01:05:45,195
- What are you calling him for?
- He has a motorbike. We need him.

821
01:06:10,997 --> 01:06:14,477
I may go home soon, Kate,
see if the others have found her.

822
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:17,357
She might be in the kitchen,
havin' a cup of tea.

823
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:19,837
I wonder if we'll
soon have tea to drink.

824
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:23,157
I've had a letter from Father Carlin.
And I'm not a teacher anymore.

825
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:26,158
- What?
- Decline in numbers, he said.

826
01:06:26,198 --> 01:06:27,838
A lie.

827
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:29,838
He thanked me.

828
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,798
A lie.

829
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:34,038
A lie, a lie, a lie, a lie.

830
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:53,159
What is that?

831
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:55,759
The Lughnasa fires.

832
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:58,999
People light them
and dance and jump over them.

833
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,880
A fellow called Sweeney
fell into a fire.

834
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,800
He was almost burnt to death.

835
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:08,160
Lugh, god of light,
god of music.

836
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,760
I remember.

837
01:07:09,841 --> 01:07:12,240
Uncle Jack, where are you goin'?

838
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,680
I'm supposed to be mindin' ya.

839
01:07:15,681 --> 01:07:18,040
Uncle Jack! Come back!

840
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,086
You're not even a real priest.

841
01:08:55,126 --> 01:08:57,406
Welcome to the Lughnasa fires,
Father Jack!

842
01:08:57,446 --> 01:09:00,207
Is this Africa? Rose?

843
01:09:01,446 --> 01:09:05,567
We're gettin' married. I'm Danny
Bradley, and I'm gonna marry Rose.

844
01:09:07,566 --> 01:09:10,207
I wanna go home!

845
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:12,287
Are these our relations?
Is this your wedding?

846
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:15,327
No, they're savages! Pagans!
They're no connection to us!

847
01:09:15,408 --> 01:09:18,047
Will you marry us, Father?
Marry me and Rose!

848
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,808
I won't marry you, Danny.
You're married already!

849
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:23,648
No, look, Rose! Look! Look!

850
01:09:23,688 --> 01:09:25,688
Look what I'll do for you.

851
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:35,769
- I'm goin' away!
- Where?

852
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:39,209
It's a secret! Good-bye!

853
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:42,049
We must go home!
These are not our people!

854
01:09:42,088 --> 01:09:44,449
- Where are you goin'?
- I don't know where!

855
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:49,250
- We're just going home.
- I'll follow you.

856
01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:52,049
I'll get ya.

857
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:28,412
Are you comin' home?

858
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:35,332
You got loads.

859
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:39,772
They're nice.
They're sweet.

860
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:43,613
Rose love, we were wild
worried about you.

861
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:46,333
You said you were
coming home to lie down.

862
01:10:46,372 --> 01:10:49,372
- But you didn't come home.
- Were ya in the town?

863
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:51,493
That's why you're all
dressed up, isn't it?

864
01:10:51,573 --> 01:10:53,213
You went into Ballybeg, didn't ya?

865
01:10:57,774 --> 01:11:00,133
We'll go and pick some more
blackberries next week.

866
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:04,213
All right. I'll lie down
for a few hours...

867
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:07,334
but I'll be up to fetch turf
in the morning.

868
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:09,414
I want to know
where you've been.

869
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:12,214
- Later, after she sleeps.
- Where you have been!

870
01:11:17,934 --> 01:11:19,734
- Lough Anna.
- Where?

871
01:11:22,455 --> 01:11:24,574
- Lough Anna.
- Kate, just leave her.

872
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:27,495
- You walked to Lough Anna?
- Yes.

873
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:30,055
Did you meet someone there?

874
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:33,215
Had you arranged
to meet someone there?

875
01:11:37,495 --> 01:11:42,216
I had arranged to meet
Danny Bradley there.

876
01:11:43,735 --> 01:11:48,016
He brought me out in
his father's blue boat.

877
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:50,216
It's a very peaceful place
up there.

878
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:54,057
He calls me his Rosebud, Aggie.

879
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:57,657
Oh, I told you, didn't I?

880
01:11:57,736 --> 01:12:00,577
Then the two of us went up
through the back hills.

881
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:04,297
We must have seen the last
of the Lughnasa fires.

882
01:12:04,337 --> 01:12:07,297
They are pagans.

883
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:10,458
I came home with Jack...

884
01:12:10,537 --> 01:12:14,258
and I said good-bye to Danny.

885
01:12:16,538 --> 01:12:19,617
And that's all I'm gonna tell ya.

886
01:12:19,658 --> 01:12:23,098
That's all any of youse
are gonna hear!

887
01:12:29,418 --> 01:12:31,618
What's happened to this house?

888
01:12:31,659 --> 01:12:35,579
Mother of God,
what has happened to this house?

889
01:12:35,658 --> 01:12:37,859
We should get some sleep.

890
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:44,539
Come on, Katie dear,
to your bed.

891
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,460
Maggie'll kill you.

892
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:49,584
- Where's Gerry?
- He's trying to fix the aerial.

893
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:51,624
That bloody set
was never any good.

894
01:13:51,663 --> 01:13:53,703
Never any damned good,
that bloody set!

895
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:57,584
- He knows what he's doing.
- Never any damned good, that bloody set.

896
01:13:57,663 --> 01:14:01,023
You've already offered us
that bit of wisdom.

897
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:55,427
Come on. Come and join me.
Come on.

898
01:15:18,428 --> 01:15:20,068
Come on.

899
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:23,039
Will you and Michael
come away with me?

900
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,239
I know.

901
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:32,960
Is there nothing I can do?

902
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:37,520
Nothing.

903
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:40,000
I could leave you alone.

904
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,000
You could.

905
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,840
Soon.

906
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,000
Don't leave me just yet.

907
01:19:23,523 --> 01:19:26,002
Come on. Keep up.

908
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,643
Come on, Daddy.
Give it to me.

909
01:19:35,763 --> 01:19:37,683
Soccer's no game for a man.

910
01:19:37,763 --> 01:19:40,323
Rugby! That's what Welshmen play.

911
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:46,084
If I had time,
I'd teach you to play rugby.

912
01:19:48,524 --> 01:19:51,124
You know I'm goin' away
tomorrow, don't you?

913
01:19:52,763 --> 01:19:54,804
Will you miss me?

914
01:19:54,884 --> 01:19:56,884
Will you miss me?

915
01:19:56,965 --> 01:19:59,525
And Mammy? Will you miss her?

916
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:02,324
I will.

917
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:04,645
Then don't go, Daddy.

918
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:08,085
I'm a soldier now, Michael.

919
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:11,645
I have to fight.

920
01:20:13,165 --> 01:20:15,205
Look, there's your Uncle Jack.

921
01:20:19,366 --> 01:20:21,085
What's he doin' in that regalia?

922
01:20:25,525 --> 01:20:27,366
Gerry, my dear friend.

923
01:20:27,446 --> 01:20:31,046
We must now make
our formal farewells.

924
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,886
I hope all goes well in Spain,
you old rogue.

925
01:20:33,927 --> 01:20:36,367
- You're off tomorrow?
- I am, comrade.

926
01:20:36,446 --> 01:20:38,846
That's a wonderful uniform.
I could do with that for Spain.

927
01:20:38,927 --> 01:20:44,286
It was my uniform when I was chaplain
to the British Army in the Great War.

928
01:20:44,327 --> 01:20:48,807
There was a time when it fitted.
There was a time when it was splendid.

929
01:20:49,687 --> 01:20:51,767
It still is splendid.

930
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,207
We must now make the exchange
the way they do in Africa.

931
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:58,528
Now, I place my possession
on the ground.

932
01:21:00,727 --> 01:21:03,488
And take three steps away.

933
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:07,769
Then I turn round once.

934
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:17,289
Now, you come to where I was, and
I move over to where you were standing.

935
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:26,729
The exchange is now formally
and irrevocably complete.

936
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:30,529
This is my straw hat.

937
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:32,809
And that is your ceremonial hat.

938
01:21:34,569 --> 01:21:35,929
Put it on.

939
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,850
Splendid! It suits ya.

940
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,571
Splendid.

941
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:11,532
I'm broke to the bone arrivin' so late
but I had to tell youse...

942
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:13,572
it's definite.

943
01:22:14,572 --> 01:22:16,652
I have to pay youse off.

944
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:18,573
There'll be no more need
for home knit gloves.

945
01:22:18,652 --> 01:22:21,212
The factory's definitely
startin' in Donegal Town.

946
01:22:21,293 --> 01:22:23,173
How are we going to live, vera?

947
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:27,213
Youse may apply for a job in it.

948
01:22:27,293 --> 01:22:29,493
I wish youse better luck
than I had.

949
01:22:29,573 --> 01:22:32,973
They told me I was too old.
I'm 41.

950
01:22:33,973 --> 01:22:35,493
They said I was too old.

951
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:37,373
It was good of you
to come and tell us.

952
01:22:39,094 --> 01:22:41,654
I only wish it was better news.

953
01:22:42,693 --> 01:22:45,454
- Good night to youse.
- Good night.

954
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:02,135
I'll make us all
a nice cup of tea.

955
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:05,615
Sit down.

956
01:23:10,415 --> 01:23:12,735
Right.

957
01:23:12,816 --> 01:23:15,536
Right you be.

958
01:23:22,016 --> 01:23:26,896
For there's no places
on Earth just like

959
01:23:26,976 --> 01:23:30,656
The homes of Donegal

960
01:23:32,937 --> 01:23:34,977
I can't stick that song.

961
01:23:39,817 --> 01:23:44,457
- We might get another rooster for ya.
- It doesn't matter.

962
01:23:44,498 --> 01:23:49,137
- And I'll put manners on him early.
- I don't want another.

963
01:23:50,097 --> 01:23:51,337
Where's Jack?

964
01:23:52,498 --> 01:23:55,257
He's out lookin' up
at the moon and stars.

965
01:23:55,338 --> 01:24:00,338
He's conducting his own
distinctive spiritual search.

966
01:24:00,378 --> 01:24:02,419
Let him.

967
01:24:02,498 --> 01:24:05,858
Do you know what I'm thinkin'?

968
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:08,259
What has Ballybeg not got
that Ballybeg needs?

969
01:24:08,338 --> 01:24:10,179
- What?
- A dressmaker.

970
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:13,779
So why doesn't Agnes Mundy
who has such clever hands...

971
01:24:13,819 --> 01:24:15,859
why doesn't she dressmake?

972
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:18,699
- Clever hands?
- You'd get a pile of work.

973
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:22,099
- You'd make a fortune.
- Some fortune in Ballybeg.

974
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:23,740
Stitching shrouds.

975
01:24:23,819 --> 01:24:26,580
- Then how you gonna manage?
- She'll manage.

976
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:29,740
We'll pull together.
The family will always manage.

977
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:32,660
We will manage.
We always do.

978
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,780
- And you know how, don't you?
- How?

979
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,020
Our secret. Don't you remember?

980
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:45,221
That's right. Our secret.

981
01:25:31,064 --> 01:25:33,783
We never saw them again.

982
01:25:33,823 --> 01:25:36,103
They vanished without a trace.

983
01:25:37,223 --> 01:25:40,744
Years later I learned that they ended
as shadows on the streets of London...

984
01:25:40,824 --> 01:25:44,584
scraping a living together,
dying alone.

985
01:25:49,624 --> 01:25:51,904
My Uncle Jack
lasted as long as he could...

986
01:25:51,985 --> 01:25:54,385
believing to the end
in the Earth and the stars.

987
01:26:00,465 --> 01:26:03,585
My father did go to Spain
and was wounded.

988
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:08,306
My Aunt Kate said it would
put an end to his dancing days.

989
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:10,225
Maybe it did.

990
01:26:12,026 --> 01:26:16,346
My mother got a job at the factory.
She hated it all her life.

991
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:19,946
And my father wrote to her
occasionally.

992
01:26:21,826 --> 01:26:24,867
Through it all, Aunt Maggie
tried to keep the house going.

993
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,066
She tried to pretend
that nothin' had happened...

994
01:26:27,147 --> 01:26:28,986
but the family had changed.

995
01:26:29,067 --> 01:26:31,387
It had changed forever.

996
01:26:36,667 --> 01:26:40,027
And my Aunt Kate
was inconsolable.

997
01:26:40,108 --> 01:26:41,947
Inconsolable.

998
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:02,869
Me... I was waitin'
to become a man...

999
01:27:02,909 --> 01:27:04,829
waitin' to get away.

1000
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:06,869
Just to go away.

1001
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:10,149
But the memory of that summer
is like a dream to me...

1002
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:13,189
a dream of music that is
both heard and imagined...

1003
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,869
that seems to be both itself
and its own echo.

1004
01:27:16,949 --> 01:27:20,070
When I remember it,
I think of it as dancing...

1005
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:24,149
dancing as if language
had surrendered to movement...

1006
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:27,670
dancing as if language
no longer existed...

1007
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,630
because words were
no longer necessary.
