1
00:00:00,907 --> 00:00:03,347
When God created man,
a jealous Lucifer

2
00:00:03,347 --> 00:00:05,109
mounted a great
rebellion in heaven.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,347
His army of angels
was defeated

4
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:09,255
and forever banished
from paradise.

5
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:13,247
These angels, the fallen,
abandoned Lucifer,

6
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,890
choosing to live on earth
among the pleasures of humans.

7
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:19,647
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations,

8
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:22,847
children called Nephilim:
by the power of angels

9
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:23,964
with the souls of man.

10
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:27,031
Angry, the Creator
flooded the earth,

11
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:29,717
killing the Nephilim
and driving the fallen
into hiding.

12
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,433
He sent the Powers,
fierce warrior angels,

13
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,371
?ved the flood.

14
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:38,850
but there was hope
for the fallenn a prcy.

15
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,147
A Nephilim would be born
who would redeem them

16
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:42,912
and return them
to paradise.

17
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:46,847
So the falled watched...
and waited.

19
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,363
Tom?

20
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,043
Lori?

21
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,229
Tom? Lori?

22
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,449
Come, Nephilim!

23
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:38,801
Meet your death!

24
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:51,078
Huh.

25
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,030
Oh, man, that was wicked.

26
00:01:58,647 --> 00:01:59,598
Oh...

27
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:01,588
Hey, buddy.

28
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,107
Oh, hey, hey,
stop, come on.

29
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,773
All right, come on, come on.

30
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,820
Hey, a little lighter
on the noise, okay?

31
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,061
I got
a killer headache.

32
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,047
Surprise.

33
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:14,747
Hey,
Happy Birthday!

34
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:15,847
Happy Birthday!

35
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:17,347
Don't let it go out.
I got it.

36
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,631
Okay.
We got it.

37
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,502
Here it is.
There you go.
Make a wish.

38
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,539
Yay.
Nice.

39
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,311
Thank you, Lori.
Thanks, Tom.

40
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:31,447
Wow. Um, you guys
didn't have to do this.

41
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,852
Didn't have to?
It's your 18th birthday.

42
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:35,947
It's like the start
of a whole new life.

43
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,147
Yeah. And we'll
have a party tonight,

44
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:41,147
but we just wanted
to, uh, to--

45
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:44,932
how happy we are
that you were born,

46
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,547
that last three years
you've been with us

47
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,847
have been just wonderful.

48
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:50,410
Yeah.

49
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:52,556
Thank you.

50
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:56,509
I mean, yeah.
Thanks a lot.

51
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,398
Now, you know
the Corbett tradition.

52
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,947
Birthday boy gets
to pick dinner,

53
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,847
so what'll it be?

54
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:05,447
Um, well, if it's
not too much trouble,

55
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:07,734
maybe Tom can make
his spaghetti sauce?

56
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:10,343
Yeah. Yeah?

57
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:12,647
Of course not.
It's no trouble.

58
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,347
I'll make it
extra-special.

59
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:15,868
It already is, hon.

60
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:18,847
Okay. All right.

61
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:21,193
Well, um, I got to get
to work, so...

62
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:23,647
we'll see you,
and save your appetite.

63
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:26,247
Maybe after the party,
we can work on the Caddy.

64
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,459
Cool.
All right.

65
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:31,868
That was very nice of you,
and brave.

66
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,447
I can talk him out of it.

67
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,329
I'll tell him we're
out of the ingredients.

68
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:38,647
No, no, I'm actually, uh...

69
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:40,127
I'm beginning to like
Tom's sauce.

70
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,446
Or at least
get used to it.

71
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,431
How'd you get to be
such a good kid, huh?

72
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,747
I got to get Stevie up.

73
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,147
So enjoy your breakfast,

74
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,896
and happy birthday.

75
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:02,882
How's it taste?

76
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:22,147
this just arrived

77
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:23,577
he said it wa urgent

78
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,347
it's late You may go now

79
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,847
But you have another meeting

80
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,146
it's no t neccessary for you to be here

81
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,047
i'll see  you tomorrow

82
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,547
what was that

83
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:36,447
just the wind

84
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:37,796
we're on the eighty-first floor

85
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,933
Hello, Fallen.

86
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:45,547
Verchiel.

87
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,188
You look like you were
expecting someone.

88
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,144
Who was coming
to visit you, Samchial?

89
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:52,664
No one, Your Worship.

90
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:56,747
Look we find you,

91
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,663
lying to us.

92
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:01,547
What's that in your hair?

93
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:02,546
Is it gray?

94
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:06,229
I think you've been
hanging around these monkeys
for too long.

95
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:09,447
Did you really think

96
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:11,703
that you could hide yourself
behind all this magic?

97
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,447
I mean, what good are runes

98
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,407
when you show yourself
by your actions?

99
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,621
[sigh]It's very sloppy.

100
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,257
Maybe you're sick
of this realm.

101
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:33,347
Or maybe you actually feel
remorse for your actions,

102
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:36,243
and you've decided
to turn yourself in.

103
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:39,266
I have paid
for my transgressions.
You've paid?

104
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:43,147
Being exiled to this planet
is far from payment

105
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:44,682
for what you did, my friend.

106
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,247
Your kind has yet
to be punished.

107
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,026
By whom? You and your
fanatic followers?

108
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:54,747
You're not enacting
the will of the Creator.

109
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,747
You're on your own crusade
to destroy those

110
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,347
whom you know were loved
more by the Creator.

111
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,211
Silence!

112
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,928
Prepare yourself
for your judgment, Fallen.

113
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:12,960
Yaah!

114
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,855
Only the Creator can judge.

115
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:57,899
Wait!

116
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,018
Oh! You fool!

117
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:10,395
He was hiding something,
and you destroyed it!

118
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:16,214
[Lori]
Mom, let it go.

119
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,047
There are plenty
of kids out there

120
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:19,931
who call their parents
by their first names.

121
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,847
Besides, Dr. Jonas says

122
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:24,346
that it's common
for older adopted children,

123
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,047
and it doesn't mean

124
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,776
that Aaron's
not bonding with us.

125
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,979
No, Mom, Tom and I don't
need a second opinion.

126
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:34,559
We're happy working
with Dr. Jonas.

127
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,306
Besides, Aaron trusts him.

128
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:41,240
Oh! It's okay, Stevie. Sorry.

129
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,547
I-- No, it's okay.

130
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,528
I just touched Stevie
without telling him.

131
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:48,047
And I think you're wrong

132
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,326
about forcing Aaron
to call us Mom and Dad.

133
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,647
You know,
he's been through more

134
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,969
than you or I
could ever understand.

135
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,753
Oh, here he is now, Mom.

136
00:07:58,147 --> 00:07:58,895
Yeah.

137
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,560
She wants to wish you
a Happy Birthday.

138
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,117
Hey, Marge--

139
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,105
Grandma.

140
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:13,254
A white button-down shirt,
slacks, and loafers.

141
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,546
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

142
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:19,342
Okay. I will.

143
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:22,298
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

144
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,347
She wanted to make sure
I was dressed right

145
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,547
to meet
the school recruiters.

146
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:31,466
Oh, well, I officially
apologize for my mother again.

147
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,547
It's no big deal.
Don't sweat it.

148
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,547
So, you're legal now.

149
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,147
Are you sure you don't
want to play hooky today?

150
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:42,147
We could go and vote,
enlist in the Army,

151
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,367
or--ooh--you could see
an "R"-rated movie.

152
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:48,147
No, thanks anyway.
I got a big test in math,

153
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:50,258
and I got to practice
for the meet on Saturday.

154
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,456
Oh. Headache.

155
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,147
You're not doing
any dumb jock stuff

156
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:58,139
like starving yourself
for the wrestling meet?

157
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:00,420
Uh, with my metabolism,
I don't have to.

158
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,330
Lucky dog.

159
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,639
Hey, bro.
How's it going?

160
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,825
Hey.

161
00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:12,747
You're the only one
that--

162
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,847
[together]
he does that with.

163
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,269
Well, Stevie and I have
an understanding. Right, bro?

164
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:21,747
Oh, hey, Stevie, leave
Aaron's ring alone.

165
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:23,947
That's okay.
He can play with it.

166
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,147
Hey, Stevie,
I got to get going.

167
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,338
I'm gonna hand you over
now, okay?

168
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:30,144
Hey, Stevie, Mama's
gonna take you
from Aaron, okay?

169
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,547
Oh, no. It's okay.

170
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:34,747
We got to let Aaron
get to school, right?

171
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:36,247
Yeah, we're gonna have
some fun today,

172
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,107
aren't we? Hmm?

173
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,547
Hey, no,
it's a good thing

174
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,436
that he responds so well
to you, right, kiddo?

175
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,068
Yeah. You go to school.
We're fine.

176
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,547
?

177
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:56,447
i told you. i don't know what
you're talking about

178
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:58,847
we know youre master
was part of a system

179
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,884
that protects the fallen angels
and their offspring

180
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,947
where are the records?

181
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:07,847
She knows nothing.
Dispose of her.

182
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,069
wait wait

183
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:13,747
sometimes i woould see hime

184
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,890
he would stand in front of the
markings. on the wall

185
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,290
show me where

186
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:24,526
here

187
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,431
He has hidden them
behind the runes.

188
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,322
You have done well.

189
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:41,041
We have no more
need of you.

190
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,235
Very clever, Samchial.

191
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:02,498
The abominations--we can
track them down and des--

192
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:05,192
What's that?

193
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:08,847
It's North America.

194
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,430
It looks
like Massachusetts.

195
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,847
Damn him!

196
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,147
He rigged it.

197
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:16,039
You think?

198
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:20,957
Samchial's
not alone in this.

199
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,441
He was expecting
someone else.

200
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,147
Find out who it is,

201
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,293
and let me know
before the others do.

202
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,809
Corbett-hole.

203
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,089
Lay off, Lockhart.
I got a headache.

204
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,947
You weren't at weigh-in
this morning.

205
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,647
Yeah, I got in late.

206
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:45,601
I was 162.

207
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,447
What,
are you losing weight?

208
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,647
Better bulk up if you want
to compete in the 166 class.

209
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,747
No, I'm good.
I'm shooting for your level.

210
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,047
I mean, I'm good at 166,

211
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,047
but I'm gonna be great
at 157,

212
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:59,847
so you watch your butt,
"Corbutt,"

213
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:02,447
'cause I'm coming for you.
I'll eat you alive.

214
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:04,247
Someone screw
with your locker, Brady?

215
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:05,947
Yeah, real funny.

216
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,267
You think they'd get
tired of the same joke.

217
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:13,246
Here.

218
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,725
For a jock,
you're almost human.

219
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,431
And for a geek,
you're almost, uh...

220
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:31,609
Ah, you're just a geek.

221
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:40,959
Why do you put up
with that nose wipe?

222
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,047
Ah, leave him alone,
Peter.

223
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,647
Just trying
to help you out.

224
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,147
It's bad enough
you're a foster kid,

225
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,547
but hanging out
with losers like that,

226
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,947
it's bad for your rep.

227
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,003
Catch my drift, Corbett?

228
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:52,184
Corbot.

229
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,047
Don't even think it.

230
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,179
That is way
out of your league.

231
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,353
Hey.
Hi.

232
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:14,365
Ouch.  That had
to hurt, huh?

233
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:16,314
I got to get to class.

234
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:21,957
Wrestling is
the art of strategy.

235
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,747
Do not think
about your first move.

236
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:27,660
Think about how you're gonna
get to your fifth move.

237
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,047
Okay, mat time.
Situational drills.

238
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,851
Pinning combinations.
Partner up.

239
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,147
Wrestling is
the art of leaders.

240
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:38,847
Genghis Khan
chose his generals

241
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,547
by their wrestling skill.

242
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:41,547
And at the regionals,

243
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,689
we're gonna show everybody
what kind of leaders we are.

244
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:47,247
Uh, Corbett, partner up
with Lockhart.

245
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:48,447
You're gunning
for state champ.

246
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:49,847
Gotta give you a challenge.

247
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,347
Got what it takes,
Corbett-hole?

248
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:52,447
How's the headache?

249
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,124
Still there.

250
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,847
Good. Make it easier
to take you down.

251
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:56,804
Thanks for the love.

252
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,347
Couldn't hold
the half nelson.

253
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,647
Weak, Corbett, weak.

254
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,357
You're gonna have to do
much better on Saturday.

255
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:29,247
[Coach]
Mat work.
Pinning combinations.

256
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:29,908
Partner up.

257
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,047
Hey, Brady.

258
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,747
Saw you in the shower
today, buddy.

259
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,447
Doesn't look good.

260
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,047
Yeah, shouldn't you be
in the girls' locker room?

261
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:46,147
Come on, Peter,
let me go.

262
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:47,647
"Come on, Peter,
let me go."

263
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,847
"Peter, oh, please,
don't hurt me."

264
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,847
Can we be intelligent
about this?

265
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,793
Whoa! You're saying
Peter's not intelligent?

266
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,647
Aren't you guys tired of
kicking the crap out of me?

267
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,547
Not yet.
Lay off, Lockhart.

268
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:02,847
Whoa, it's
the orphan boy.

269
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:05,747
Yeah, poster boy here
for birth control.

270
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,911
You challenging Lockhart
after he trounced you today?

271
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,354
Didn't you learn your
lesson in gym today,

272
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:12,718
Corbett-hole.

273
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,435
I guess not.

274
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,147
[classmate]
Aaron,
what are you doing?

275
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:23,847
[classmate]
Lay off, Corbett!
You're choking him!

276
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:24,847
He's choking him.

277
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,547
Let him loose, Corbett!
You're choking him!

278
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:27,471
Lay off him!

279
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:31,047
Aaron, come on, let him go.
He's just a jerk.

280
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:32,647
Man, lay off!
You're choking him!

281
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,247
Come on, let him go.

282
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,292
Lay off him!

283
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:18,928
[Girl]
It's your birthday?

284
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,947
Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:26,715
I heard what you did
for David Brady in the gym.

286
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,347
I think it's cool.

287
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:32,202
It was stupid.
I, uh, I lost control.

288
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:33,596
I could have hurt him.

289
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:37,847
Well, it's just
I promised Tom and Lori

290
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,314
that I wouldn't
fight anymore.

291
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:40,847
Who?

292
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,247
Oh, they're my parents.

293
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,247
Oh!

294
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:45,147
I'm sorry. They're-- Yeah.
They're my parents.

295
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,447
They're-- Actually, they're
my adoptive parents.

296
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,247
Yeah. I heard
you're adopted.

297
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:50,986
So am I.

298
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,104
You are?
Yeah.

299
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,547
My mom died
when I was born,

300
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,447
and my aunt
raised me.

301
00:16:58,447 --> 00:16:59,947
And when she died,
I moved up here

302
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,800
to live with my
other aunt.

303
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:05,447
Wow.

304
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,147
That's--
That's so cool.

305
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,347
What?

306
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,947
No, no, no.
Not that you're an orphan.

307
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,447
That's not what I meant.
I'm an orphan too.

308
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:14,847
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,347
I didn't mean it
that way.

310
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:17,447
It's okay.

311
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,647
It's just,
uh, you, uh--

312
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,747
You know
your biological family.

313
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,147
You don't?
No.

314
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,647
I was, uh, placed
in foster care

315
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:27,341
when I was born.

316
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,251
Sorry.

317
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,333
What are you gonna do
for your birthday?

318
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,247
You having a big party?

319
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,347
No, I'll probably
just, uh,

320
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:43,447
hang out
with Tom and Lori,

321
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:45,747
and Stevie.
He's their son.

322
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:48,047
That probably sounds
really, uh, dorky,

323
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,970
spending my 18th birthday
with my family.

324
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:55,196
No. It sounds
really wonderful.

325
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,347
[Girl]
Vilma, come here.

326
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,355
I got to go.

327
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:03,510
Happy birthday.

328
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,847
[Woman]
So, water conservation.

329
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,447
Three basic goals:

330
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,547
Increase the amount
of groundwater,

331
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:15,847
keep the unpolluted
waters clean

332
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,747
and clean up
the polluted waters,

333
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:20,147
and decrease our own
personal use.

334
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:23,647
Americans use 60 gallons
of water each per day.

335
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:26,847
That's five times more
than any European.

336
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,047
Now, when you're
brushing your teeth,

337
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:29,947
do you let
the water run,

338
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,847
or do you turn the shower on
before you get into it,

339
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:35,047
let it run, getting warm,
[child crying]

340
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,447
or run the water
for a while

341
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:38,847
before you get
a glass of water,

342
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,263
wash just a few things
in the laundry machine?

343
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,046
Okay, this material will
be on next week's test.

344
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,047
Homework tonight, Chapter 3,

345
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:49,557
and answer the questions
in the back.

346
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,034
Mr. Corbett,
before you go,

347
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,647
I know you have a--

348
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:58,847
a lot of offers
from colleges,

349
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,547
[voice distorted]
based upon
your wrestling,

350
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:01,747
but I don't want you

351
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:03,847
to neglect your
academic achievements.

352
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,647
I have a friend who's
recruiting for Cornell.

353
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,047
He's looked
at your records.

354
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,447
He's impressed, and he
wants to meet with you.

355
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,447
Now, I know it may
be as much money

356
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:13,747
as a sports scholarship,

357
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:15,947
but I think you should
listen to his offer.

358
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,808
Okay. I will.
Thank you, Mrs. Baker.

359
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:23,210
Aaron, you're a smart boy.
You're talented.

360
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:25,247
Kids like you,
they're destined for a fate

361
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,047
greater than being
an ex-wrestling champ.

362
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,305
Make something of yourself.

363
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,270
Can I help you?

364
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,984
The boy,
the one who just left.

365
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,705
Aaron Corbett?

366
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:50,739
Yes. Thank you.

367
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,346
Is there a problem?

368
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:53,793
Not anymore.

369
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:36,013
He's really mean.

370
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:40,765
[Vilma]
He's nice to me.

371
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,498
Yeah, like a spider,
and you're the fly.

372
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,347
Maybe I'm the spider,
and he's the fly.

373
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,632
[speaking Portuguese]
I think he's cute.

374
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,038
[Man]
Come on, class.
Take your seats.

375
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:11,332
Open up your textbooks
to Chapter 5.

376
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:12,746
[whispered voice]
Run. Disappear.

377
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:16,006
Run!

378
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:19,897
[female voice]
They come! Run!

379
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,347
Run! Danger.

380
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,647
Leave this place.

381
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,523
Run.

382
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,145
Danger. Run.

383
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:29,847
Run!
Run!
Run!

384
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:30,671
Danger!

385
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,647
Get home...

386
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:36,646
get some sleep...

387
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,014
and everything
will be okay.

388
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:46,874
Ah, kids today.

389
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:48,693
Drink, drugs.

390
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,113
Shouldn't be driving.

391
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:05,647
Angels?

392
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,838
Nephilim.

393
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:22,849
Come on,
come on, come on.

394
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:28,947
Hey.

395
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:31,947
Hey, you.

396
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,347
Hold, it, hold it.
Stop, stop, stop!

397
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:34,447
Hold it! Now wait a minute,

398
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,643
wait a minute,
wait a minute!

399
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:37,270
Oh, my.

400
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:48,544
He's come.

401
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:52,283
The Punisher.

402
00:22:57,947 --> 00:23:00,147
what shall we do?
They've come to kill us

403
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,447
don't worry my beloved

404
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,726
i'll proctect you.

405
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,147
They won't find you

406
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:09,220
But the signs show...

407
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:11,776
you must come with me

408
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:16,547
father. no. what are you doing?
no please

409
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:17,747
You have your Nephilim.

410
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:19,147
I've kept my part
of the bargain.

411
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,580
please. father. no

412
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:22,147
how could you do this?

413
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,814
Then you will live,
Grigori.

414
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:25,643
For now.

415
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,747
Papa?

416
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:30,823
Papa!

417
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:22,426
Lori?

418
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:25,198
[male voice]
Aaron!

419
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:27,147
Stevie?

420
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:28,116
[panting]
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

421
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:30,761
Love you, love you,
love you.

422
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,117
Okay, play now with Gabriel?

423
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,769
Aaron scared?
Aaron okay?

424
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:40,047
I swear, if I hear
one more word from you,

425
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,247
I'm gonna scream.

426
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,609
Aaron?
Hey, you're home early.

427
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,447
Everything all right?

428
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:46,747
Yeah, are you okay?

429
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:49,447
Yeah, yeah, I think
I'm just, uh...

430
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,847
I think I'm coming
down with something.

431
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:53,647
Oh, you're pale.
Oh, and you're feverish.

432
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:55,147
Yeah,
I just, uh...

433
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:56,247
I just need
to rest.

434
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,147
Are you sure?
Can I make you something?

435
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,847
No, no. I'm fine.

436
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:01,347
I'm just gonna,
um, go upstairs.

437
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:02,073
Okay.

438
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:06,549
[panting]
Hey, wait for Gabriel!

439
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:12,327
Gabe is not talking to me.

440
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,939
Gabe is not talking to me

441
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:19,547
Aaron angry
at Gabriel?

442
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:21,547
Gabe is not talking to me

443
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,547
Gabriel did
something wrong?

444
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:24,627
Shut up.

445
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:26,364
Please, just shut up.

446
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:30,291
I'm losing it.

447
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,547
This can't be happening.

448
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,147
Aaron angry.

449
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:36,569
Gabriel
knows why.

450
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,747
It's a...dream.

451
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,347
It's...hallucinations
from a fever.

452
00:25:41,347 --> 00:25:44,318
Maybe I...hit my head
too hard in gym class.

453
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:47,847
Gabriel took,
chewed up

454
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,547
couldn't stop.

455
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,503
Gabriel sorry.

456
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:01,325
Aaron, please forgive.
Please.

457
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,547
Gabe will never
chew socks.

458
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:05,447
It's not about
the damn sock.

459
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,247
I know, but I promise
I will never chew socks.

460
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:08,547
Please be quiet
for a second.

461
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:09,847
Is everything okay up there?

462
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:11,747
Gabriel fine.
Aaron act funny.

463
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,447
We're good--
I mean, I'm good.

464
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,218
Okay.

465
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,647
Inside.

466
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:20,047
Yeah, but I thought maybe
a quick game of fetch.

467
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,710
Animals and people
aren't supposed to talk
to each other.

468
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:26,546
Dogs are dogs,
and humans are humans.

469
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:29,247
Aaron talk to Gabe
all the time.

470
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:30,347
Gabe talk
to Aaron all the time.

471
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:32,147
I know that,
but there's a difference

472
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:35,312
between talking to
and understanding, Gabe.

473
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:41,147
I'm--I'm arguing with a dog.

474
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:43,547
This is crazy.
I'm--I'm crazy.

475
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:45,247
They're, uh...

476
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:48,047
They're gonna lock
me away, Gabe.

477
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:50,047
Aaron scared
Gabriel talk?

478
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,847
Gabriel no talk.

479
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:52,747
No talk?

480
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:53,892
No talk.

481
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,944
Okay. Okay.

482
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:59,747
I'm gonna sleep this off.

483
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:02,047
When I wake up,
everything's gonna be fine.

484
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:04,747
Yeah, and we'll celebrate
your birthday tomorrow.

485
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,647
Okay.

486
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:07,547
Can't wait.

487
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:09,347
We're gonna have
cake and ice cream.

488
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:10,547
It's gonna be
a lot of fun.

489
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,376
Stop talking.

490
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:42,347
[Man]
there is no mercy
for abominations!

491
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,434
There is no mercy
for Nephilim!
Aah!

492
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:06,169
Hello.

493
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:11,606
No more talking?

494
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:19,916
Okay.

495
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:26,472
Good boy.

496
00:28:39,747 --> 00:28:41,747
All right, buddy,
let's get you some food.

497
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:43,392
Good.
Love, love, love food.

498
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:45,947
Oops.

499
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:47,147
Gabriel talked.

500
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:48,947
I think
I'm going crazy.

501
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,547
Have you told
Tom and Lori?

502
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:52,313
No. No. Um...

503
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:55,947
You know, they've been
so nice to me,

504
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:56,892
and, uh...

505
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:00,661
now I've got to tell them
that they've adopted a schizo.

506
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:03,647
There are a lot of other
things besides schizophrenia

507
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,747
that would explain
these symptoms.

508
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,647
You and I have been
meeting for seven years.

509
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,547
We've gone through some
pretty tough situations
in foster care,

510
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:16,847
so I--I think we can
get through this one
all right, okay?

511
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,381
Good.

512
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:21,478
All right, then.

513
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:23,893
Reality check.

514
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,402
?

515
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,360
So what did I just say?

516
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:44,555
It's from Dante's Inferno.

517
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:47,155
We read it last year
in Language Arts.

518
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,447
The fallen angels are angry

519
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:51,094
because Dante's in hell
but he's not dead.

520
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:55,626
Did you, um, read
this book in Italian?

521
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,247
No.

522
00:29:57,247 --> 00:29:58,245
Non conosco l'italiano.

523
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:02,247
But you're speaking it now.

524
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:04,221
No. Ora non sto parl--

525
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:06,474
parlando.

526
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:09,908
Holy crap.

527
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:13,463
D-Do you see
what I mean?

528
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:16,919
Amazing.

529
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:20,762
Wait a minute.

530
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:33,677
..."whose fire in his eyes

531
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:37,747
"reaches further
than her heart.

532
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:39,247
"Will the flame
of the heart die

533
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:40,647
in the flames
of the fire?"

534
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:44,747
The woman thinks
of the living,

535
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:46,845
whose fire in his eyes
reaches further
than her heart.

536
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,547
Will the flame
of the heart die

537
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,447
in the flames of the fire?

538
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,441
Or something like that.

539
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,647
Hey, you live
like an onion,

540
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:00,647
with your head
in the ground.

541
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,613
An onion?
What does that mean?

542
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:08,703
Um...it means...

543
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:12,547
It means holy crap.

544
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:13,206
What?

545
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:17,247
I--I don't know, Aaron.
I don't know.

546
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,495
I've heard of people

547
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:23,051
who have suffered
a head trauma.

548
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,947
Others get brain lesions.

549
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:32,847
Well, I did have
a bad headache.

550
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,847
And suddenly, they--they
understand other languages.

551
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:37,747
I always just thought
it was urban myth.

552
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,347
Repeat this string
of numbers to me backwards:

553
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:42,147
11, 5, 8, 12, 14.

554
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,487
14, 12, 8, 5, 11.
Adds up to 50.

555
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:48,947
That's right.

556
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:51,000
And you understand
animals as well.

557
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,984
So, is Gabe
saying anything?

558
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:03,747
Gabe?

559
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,574
A lady poodle
peed right here.

560
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:11,647
Um...

561
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,211
A poodle
peed on your carpet.

562
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,647
Well, now,
that's impossible.

563
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:20,347
The label said the odor
will be gone in a week,

564
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:21,746
and absolutely no one--

565
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,719
Gabe told you that?

566
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:33,852
Damn.

567
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,847
Aaron, are you...

568
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,347
having any other symptoms?

569
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,147
I mean,
are you experiencing
nausea, vomiting?

570
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:44,247
No.

571
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,147
I'm fine.

572
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:49,333
Just...weird.

573
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:51,747
Weird.

574
00:32:51,747 --> 00:32:53,847
Yeah, well, that--

575
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,352
That is the word
for it.

576
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:01,447
I'm gonna get you in
to see my friend

577
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,447
at Stanford
Medical Center.

578
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,647
I'm gonna clear
my book tomorrow.

579
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:06,347
Can you be here
around 10 A.M.?

580
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:08,247
I want you to use
the emergency line

581
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:11,247
if you need anything,
or you feel sick,
all right?

582
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:13,647
And take notes.
Take notes, Aaron.

583
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:16,747
I want to know everything
that's going on.

584
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,647
And tell your folks.

585
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:21,047
I mean, that's
what parents are for.

586
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,447
Maybe I had a stroke
or something.

587
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:25,847
Or maybe it's genetic.

588
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:28,347
My father was a...
genius,

589
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:31,647
or my mother was part
of a medical experiment,

590
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:33,747
and died
while giving birth.

591
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:37,047
It's hard not knowing
who your parents are.

592
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,047
You're kind of an orphan
too, huh?

593
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:40,408
Aaron Gabriel's family.

594
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:45,247
What the--

595
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:46,176
Something's coming.

596
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,500
Ah.

597
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:52,977
hello young Nephilim

598
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:58,672
Do you understand the
tongue of the message

599
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:01,000
The Messenger?

600
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:04,901
What you are is obvious.
You are in danger...

601
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:07,109
Nephilim.

602
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:12,080
[Gabriel]
Aaron?

603
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:16,649
Aaron! Wait for Gabriel!

604
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,073
Oh, this is not good.

605
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:21,586
This is not good.

606
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:27,678
[Gabriel]
Play now?

607
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,303
Oh. Oh, good, yeah.

608
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:46,036
Play now?

609
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:47,621
No play.

610
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:50,483
Must work. No play.

611
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:54,269
All work, no play, makes
Aaron talk to himself.

612
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,847
I--I mean, um...

613
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,547
you speak Portugucse?

614
00:34:58,547 --> 00:34:59,947
i  didn't know

615
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,223
-no...no...i don't speak Portugucse

616
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:08,247
well, kind of.
Not really.

617
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:09,547
Just a little bit.

618
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:11,147
But your accent is perfect.

619
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:14,147
Yeah, I've-- I've been
studying it some.

620
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:17,247
It's a pretty language.

621
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:18,647
You weren't in class today.

622
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:19,847
No, no, I, uh--

623
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,847
Some say you didn't want
to go to wrestling,

624
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,547
that you're chicken.

625
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:26,747
Would that "some"
be Peter Lockhart?

626
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,747
Yeah. He's a loser.

627
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:32,023
I thought you were sick,
but here you are,

628
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,347
talking to yourself.

629
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:36,847
Oh, I was, uh,
I was talking to Gabe.

630
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:40,047
Oh, hi, poochie.
Not Poochie, Gabriel.

631
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:41,247
What a pretty dog.

632
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:42,870
Yeah, Gabriel very pretty.

633
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:46,247
Uh...

634
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,794
Oh, uh,
I'm doing research

635
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,847
for, uh, for school.

636
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,147
It's a book report.

637
00:35:52,147 --> 00:35:54,047
I love angels.

638
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:55,056
Uh...

639
00:35:57,147 --> 00:35:57,835
See?

640
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:05,995
Um, I have all kinds
of books on them.

641
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,943
Do you know
about, um, Nephilim?

642
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,247
Sure, yeah. There's all
kinds of angels.

643
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:16,047
There's the Cherubim,
the Seraphim,

644
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:17,947
the Nephilim,
who were the children

645
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:19,247
of an angel and a human.

646
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:21,547
You see, they had
the powers of angels,

647
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:24,347
but the souls of man.

648
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,729
Here, let me
show you a site.

649
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,347
"From the root 'nephel,'

650
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:34,447
"meaning 'unnaturally
begotten men,' or 'bastards.'

651
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,447
"They are the biblical
half-breeds:

652
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:37,848
half-human, half-angel."

653
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:42,691
Isn't this site great?

654
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:47,468
Yeah, yeah, this is--
This is really cool.

655
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:51,225
I think angels are here,
all around us.

656
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:55,350
What, you mean, like,
you can see 'em?

657
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,208
Well, not see 'em, but...

658
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,347
don't you ever feel

659
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:03,347
like you're in the presence
of something special?

660
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:03,993
Yeah.

661
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:08,447
I--I know
what you mean.

662
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,047
When's your
book report due?

663
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:12,047
Maybe I can help
with research.

664
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:14,147
Wow. Yeah.
That would be--

665
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:16,147
That would be fantastic,
yeah.

666
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:18,747
Um, I got to get the bus.

667
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:21,447
Uh, we both have study hall
second period tomorrow.

668
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,747
You want to meet
at the library?

669
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:24,710
Sure, I'd love to.
Yeah.

670
00:37:35,147 --> 00:37:36,903
"Nephilim had the gift
of tongues,

671
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,448
"understanding all languages,

672
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:53,147
including that of the animals
and the plants."

673
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,223
We got to find that bum.

674
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:57,361
He's right over there.

675
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:00,147
Hey! Hey!

676
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:01,247
Ohh...

677
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:04,047
Hey, you, come here,
come here, come here.

678
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,847
Listen to me. Why did you
call me that name?

679
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,847
I don't want
to hurt you.

680
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:10,947
I'm not gonna let go of you

681
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,585
until you tell me
what's going on, okay?

682
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:14,632
Okay.

683
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:17,893
Go easy with the threads.

684
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:21,047
Huh?

685
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,747
It's my best outfit.

686
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:26,647
Why did you call me
Nephilim?

687
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:27,547
'Cause that's what you are.

688
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:28,859
You're half-angel,
half-human.

689
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,612
You some sort of cult
person, is that it?

690
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,747
I'm an angel.

691
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,327
Name is Ezekiel,
Zeke for short.

692
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:43,947
Okay, okay, I got it.

693
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,247
I'm talking
to a nut case.

694
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:47,847
Well, ha ha--

695
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:48,847
You're crazier than me.

696
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:50,647
Have it your way.
Come on, Gabe.

697
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:53,895
Well, Happy 18th Birthday
to you, nonetheless.

698
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:57,606
Yep.

699
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,761
How did you know
it was my birthday?

700
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:07,389
Nephilim come of age
when they're 18,

701
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:10,447
and you can smell 'em
a mile away

702
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:11,165
when they're turning.

703
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:15,147
Ahh...

704
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:17,785
And boy, you do
smell of angel.

705
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:21,110
This is a bunch of bull.

706
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:25,183
Well, you're taking it
a lot better than most.

707
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:27,747
What do you mean?

708
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:30,447
Well, angel nature
and human nature

709
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:33,251
don't live well
together.

710
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:38,047
Nephilim, when they
experience both,

711
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:41,147
they, hmmm,
they go wackadoodle,

712
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,747
and you, you're just
a little wonka-wonka.

713
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:48,122
Huh, wonka-wonka--hoo.
Wonka-wonka. Wonka.

714
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:52,147
[Verchiel]
I have done your bidding.

715
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:53,647
I have sought out
the abominations

716
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:54,800
and destroyed them.

717
00:39:57,447 --> 00:40:00,710
But it has been a long time
since I have heard your words,

718
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,914
a sign that my work
is pleasing in your sight.

719
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:08,447
I know it is not
for me to ask,

720
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,865
but...a sign.

721
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:14,247
if you could just show me--

722
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,047
Your lordship.

723
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:16,907
What?

724
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:24,012
Your lordship, I thought
you might want these:

725
00:40:25,747 --> 00:40:27,141
the remains of Samshial.

726
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,366
What would I want
with his ashes?

727
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,247
Do you think
I'm like these humans,

728
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:40,977
needing their remains
to make themselves
feel better?

729
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,747
Huh!

730
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:44,279
Wait!

731
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,447
A sign.

732
00:40:58,447 --> 00:40:58,933
Thank you.

733
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:05,247
You have done well.

734
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:06,991
For this, you may have
the next kill.

735
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:10,047
Thank you, my lord.

736
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:12,306
We must send Kolazonta
to Massachusetts

737
00:41:13,947 --> 00:41:15,578
to find someone named Corbett.

738
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,779
If you're an angel,
show me your wings.

739
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:29,347
I'm a Grigori,

740
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:31,770
one of the highest
orders of angels.

741
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,847
I, uh, hate to break it
to you, bud,

742
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:39,747
but, uh, those
aren't wings.

743
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,144
Uh, yeah, I had 'em
clipped in the fall.

744
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:44,247
Oh, yeah?

745
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,347
So they'll grow back
in the spring?

746
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:48,647
Uh, that's fall,
not as in autumn,

747
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:49,547
uh, as in fallen.

748
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:52,188
I'm a fallen angel,
so they clipped my wings.

749
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,347
Those scars you got,
they could be from anything:

750
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:56,404
an accident, surgery.

751
00:41:57,347 --> 00:42:00,047
Yeah, well,
believe it or not,

752
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:01,414
I am an angel.

753
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:06,747
Heh heh heh.

754
00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:08,147
You are Nephilim,

755
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:11,047
which means that,
uh--ha ha--

756
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:11,947
I want to be
out of here

757
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,747
when they come
looking for you.

758
00:42:14,747 --> 00:42:15,747
Who's "they"?

759
00:42:15,747 --> 00:42:18,747
The Powers.
They, uh, their gig is

760
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:22,347
to get rid of creatures
they're not pleased with,

761
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:25,347
and, uh, usually,
they find 'em

762
00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:27,847
within two days
after their 18th birthday.

763
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:29,947
Now, you've got,
maybe, a day,

764
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,747
something like that,
I think, yeah.

765
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:35,842
So you're telling me that
because I'm a Nephilim,

766
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,747
God has sent killer
angels after me.

767
00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:39,847
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

768
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,947
God, God
is such a limiting term.

769
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:44,847
The Creator
is so much more:

770
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:49,076
Allah, Shiva,
the Tao, Jehovah--

771
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:52,547
Can you please
stick to the point?

772
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,647
The point.
Oh, yes, well,

773
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:59,074
uh, humans and angels
are not supposed to, uh,

774
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:02,847
canoodle, uh, fraternize,
socialize, that sort of thing.

775
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,847
Well, anyway...

776
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:08,047
the result
of our dalliances...

777
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:11,347
are beings like you,
Nephilim.

778
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:16,105
That's it, here we go.
Aha! My prize, yes.

779
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:18,947
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah, here we go.

780
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:20,647
Play ball!
Yes! Play ball!

781
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,047
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not to play with.

782
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:26,347
This is mine. I caught this
is straightaway center field

783
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:27,847
from Babe Ruth,
and it's signed by him.

784
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:31,047
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can hear my dog?

785
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,647
Oh, yes, I can hear
your dog, absolutely.

786
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,447
That's what talking
in tongues is.

787
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,947
It's an angel thing.

788
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:42,275
And we're really good
dancers too--woo-hoo!

789
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:46,347
Uh, the Powers think

790
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:50,347
that they are the Creator's
personal storm troopers,

791
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:55,047
and their whole goal
is to get rid of Nephilim,

792
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:59,444
and they absolutely
hate the Fallen.

793
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:01,947
Why? Why do they
hate the Fallen?

794
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:04,947
The important thing is that
Camael, leader of the Powers,

795
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:08,747
is here, and he's probably
looking for you.

796
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:09,647
What is that?

797
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,147
Wait a minute.
That's my name.

798
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:13,447
This is just a bruise.
That ain't no bruise.

799
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:15,047
That's a mark.
That's ancient writing.

800
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:17,347
This is getting weird!
I wanna get--

801
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:21,247
That--That's, uh--
That's ancient writing.

802
00:44:21,247 --> 00:44:22,647
That's, uh--
I'm out of here.

803
00:44:22,647 --> 00:44:23,547
Wait, wait!

804
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:24,847
Whoa-ho-ho!

805
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:25,947
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

806
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:28,247
So you tell me some Camel
guy's looking for me?

807
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:31,547
Whoa! Hold it!

808
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,147
Gabe! Ball!
Gabe! No!

809
00:44:33,147 --> 00:44:35,203
Ball! Oh, yeah!
Play ball!

810
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:39,936
Gabe.

811
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,830
He came out of nowhere.
I didn't even--

812
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:46,809
Just get help, quick.

813
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:51,047
Gabe, you okay?

814
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:52,399
Gabriel hurt bad.

815
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:55,447
Gabe, no. Gabe,
no, no, no, no, no.

816
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:57,347
Please, please,
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe, Gabe.

817
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:58,082
Gabe.

818
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:02,309
Aaron?

819
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:07,347
All right, all right.
Move aside, move aside.

820
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:09,547
Let me show you
how a real angel heals.

821
00:45:09,547 --> 00:45:11,747
Come on, move aside.

822
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:12,247
All right.

823
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:14,447
Easy, boy.
Easy, big fella.

824
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:16,247
I'm gonna take you
for a little ride.

825
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:16,900
There you are.

826
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:27,396
It...hurts.

827
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:31,137
What is that?
What's happening?

828
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:33,956
Did you see that?

829
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:37,840
That's his soul
leaving the body.

830
00:45:40,247 --> 00:45:42,329
Whoo. That means
I lost my touch.

831
00:45:43,747 --> 00:45:45,647
Sorry, kid. You know
what they say:

832
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:46,499
use it or lose it.

833
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,647
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

834
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,447
There's got to be
something.

835
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:53,798
No. No, no, no, no, no.

836
00:45:57,847 --> 00:45:58,177
Please.

837
00:46:01,147 --> 00:46:03,347
That's something you're not
supposed to be able to do,

838
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,847
unless--

839
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:07,247
Now, look here, now, if you
are what I think you are,

840
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:10,547
then we can--we can
still save this dog.

841
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,047
Please, you've done
enough damage.

842
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:15,547
Look, you either believe me,
and he lives,

843
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:16,747
or you don't,
and he dies.

844
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:18,447
Now, it's your choice.

845
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:21,447
You put your hands on him.

846
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:22,747
Animal Control's
on their way.

847
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:23,366
Now.

848
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:26,954
This is crazy.

849
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:31,447
[Zeke]
You got to tap into
your angel nature.

850
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:34,299
It's like everything's
speeding up inside ya.

851
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:38,574
See it in the darkness.
Look hard.

852
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:41,484
You see it?

853
00:46:44,047 --> 00:46:44,866
You see it.

854
00:46:54,547 --> 00:46:55,408
I see something.

855
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,827
[Zeke]
Hear it. Call to it.
Let it fill you.

856
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:01,047
What is it?

857
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:02,347
No, no, no.
You got to control it.

858
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:05,247
You got to control it.
You got to--

859
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:06,547
If you're gonna
save this dog,

860
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:08,547
you've got to accept
your angel nature.

861
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,147
You've got to open
yourself to it.

862
00:47:10,147 --> 00:47:13,347
You've got
to let it fill you.

863
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:15,847
You've got to accept it
as part of you,

864
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:18,682
and if you doubt it,
if you question it,

865
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:21,497
it'll destroy you,
or you will destroy it.

866
00:47:23,047 --> 00:47:23,847
You understand?

867
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:24,597
Okay.

868
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:27,985
This is a part of me.

869
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,470
This is a part of who I am.

870
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,947
[Gabriel]
Aaron?

871
00:47:48,947 --> 00:47:49,628
Where's the ball?

872
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:53,947
Gabe.

873
00:47:53,947 --> 00:47:55,623
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

874
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:00,747
Oh, I'm free at last.

875
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,147
Where's the ball?
Where'd the ball go?

876
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:03,547
I'm free at last!

877
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,347
This is impossible.

878
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:07,147
I'm not half an angel.

879
00:48:07,147 --> 00:48:08,247
Oh, sorry to tell you, kid,

880
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:09,702
but you're probably
more than that.

881
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:11,385
Ah!

882
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:15,147
He bears the names
of the Fallen,

883
00:48:15,147 --> 00:48:17,583
he has the touch
of the angels.

884
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,947
No more exile.

885
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:23,247
Gabe, stay away
from the birds.

886
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:25,347
Don't worry, Aaron.
Gabriel won't hurtrt.

887
00:48:25,347 --> 00:48:26,947
Honing hunting skills.

888
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,847
Honing? Who uses words
like "honing"?

889
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,347
I don't even
words like "honing."

890
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:33,847
So, if you are
what I think you are,

891
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:36,047
we've got some business
to tend to.

892
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:36,878
No, we don't.

893
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,147
We have no business
to attend to, okay?

894
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:41,947
My dog almost died.

895
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:42,647
There you are.

896
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:44,147
And I just brought him
back to life.

897
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:47,847
Exact--
That's crazy.
That's insane.

898
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:49,447
I got to talk to Jonas.

899
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:50,547
No, no, no, no, no, no.

900
00:48:50,547 --> 00:48:53,747
Go easy with this.
You're quite a find.

901
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:54,847
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

902
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,447
Whatever just happened's
never gonna happen again.

903
00:48:56,447 --> 00:48:59,913
Great! I can help you!
I can make it all go away.

904
00:49:00,547 --> 00:49:03,982
Yes, I can. There's just
one little thing
you have to do for me:

905
00:49:04,547 --> 00:49:06,847
Redeem me.
What?

906
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,047
You can restore me
to an angel

907
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,447
and send me home.

908
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,895
Then I can call off
the Powers,

909
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:17,347
and you can be
a normal boy again.

910
00:49:17,347 --> 00:49:19,847
Okay, I'm--
I'm out of here.

911
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:21,447
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

912
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:22,847
Listen. Listen to me.
Just stay here.

913
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:25,247
Just listen to me, please.
Just listen for a moment.

914
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,769
Now, there is a chance
that you can redeem me,

915
00:49:29,147 --> 00:49:32,247
and clear me
of my transgressions.

916
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:33,647
How can I redeem you?

917
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:35,047
I don't know
what that means.

918
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:36,247
I don't know
if you're real.

919
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:38,047
You know I'm real.
Come over here.

920
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,447
Let me give you
something here.

921
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,947
Babe Ruth signed this.
It's yours. Here.

922
00:49:41,947 --> 00:49:44,547
It's not about the payment.
Do you understand?

923
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:47,147
This is just--This is--
This is too weird.

924
00:49:47,147 --> 00:49:49,447
All right, all right,
all right.

925
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:51,047
The prophesy
said you would come,

926
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,447
and here you are,

927
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,746
so all I'm asking you to do
is to redeem me.

928
00:49:55,747 --> 00:50:03,047
Just, uh, touch me,
to wave your hands over me,

929
00:50:03,047 --> 00:50:04,547
have redeeming thoughts.

930
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:06,047
i don't even know

931
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,247
Please, just do it,
do it,

932
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:08,747
and I won't ask you
anything more.

933
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:11,047
Just--I promise.

934
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,747
All right, fine.

935
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:17,047
You're--You're saved.
You're redeemed. Whatever.

936
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:17,947
That's it?

937
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:20,147
No. See? You got
the wrong guy.

938
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:21,747
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, try again.

939
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:23,147
Try like you did
with the dog.

940
00:50:23,147 --> 00:50:25,146
Look what you did
with the dog.
Huh?

941
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:27,589
Come on.

942
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:40,973
Are you satisfied?

943
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:44,347
All right, go on,
go on, damn it.

944
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:46,547
Just go on.
Don't redeem me.

945
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,647
Let me give you
a little advice, Mister!

946
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:50,647
You better get
your butt out of here

947
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,347
because if the Powers
find you,

948
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:54,547
your ass is grass,
you understand that?

949
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:56,779
I'm getting out of here.
I've had enough of you.

950
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:08,147
Super sauce comin' at ya.

951
00:51:08,147 --> 00:51:09,647
Hey! Happy Birthday!

952
00:51:09,647 --> 00:51:12,047
Hey, Happy
Belated Birthday!

953
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:13,948
Ready for some of that
special spaghetti sauce?

954
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:21,147
Aaron?

955
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:22,247
It's okay.

956
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,047
[Lori]
Hey, is everything
okay?

957
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,147
What's wrong?

958
00:51:25,147 --> 00:51:26,947
Aaron?

959
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:28,847
[Tom]
What's wrong?

960
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:30,347
You can tell us.

961
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,866
Um, I just, um...

962
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:34,836
Thank you.

963
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:39,447
Thank you for--
for everything.

964
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:40,847
I just want you guys
to know

965
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,847
that I can never repay you.

966
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,747
Repay us?
Buddy, we're family.

967
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:46,880
We don't repay.

968
00:51:46,947 --> 00:51:48,547
Hey,
we love you.

969
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:50,196
I love you too,
Mom and Dad.

970
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:55,047
Please don't
forget that.

971
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,452
Um, don't worry.
We won't.

972
00:51:59,647 --> 00:52:01,048
Come on, let's eat.

973
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,900
[Lori]
Oh, my God.
Look what he's doing.

974
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:13,518
Stevie, did you
do that, sweetie?

975
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:16,747
Angel.

976
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:18,047
Oh, my God,
you're speaking!

977
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,647
Stevie,
you're talking!

978
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:20,347
[Lori]
Hey!

979
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:21,247
[Tom]
Hey, hi, Stevie!

980
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:22,095
Hi, sweetheart.

981
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:25,247
Where's
the video camera?

982
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:26,447
Uh...
We got to get this
on tape.

983
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:29,078
Go, go, go, go.
Baby, it's me, Mommy.

984
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,376
Hey, can you say "Mommy"?

985
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,347
Aaron.

986
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:35,986
He's--
Stevie's speaking.

987
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,747
Hey, can you say
something for me?

988
00:52:39,747 --> 00:52:41,247
Aaron.

989
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:42,947
Angels.

990
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:45,047
Angels come.

991
00:52:45,047 --> 00:52:46,466
He knows who
you are, Aaron.

992
00:52:48,447 --> 00:53:08,547
This is amazing.
He knows who you are.

993
00:53:08,547 --> 00:53:09,747
I think I'll call in
sick tomorrow

994
00:53:09,747 --> 00:53:11,421
and come with you
and Stevie to the clinic.

995
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,747
What if he's
getting better?

996
00:53:14,747 --> 00:53:17,047
What if this
is all a mistake?

997
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:19,847
Take it easy.
One step at a time.

998
00:53:19,847 --> 00:53:20,670
Yeah.

999
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:25,047
You missed weigh-in
this morning.

1000
00:53:25,047 --> 00:53:26,047
Hmm?

1001
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:27,247
Coach Chaney called.

1002
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,661
Tell her what
Dr. Jonas said.

1003
00:53:30,747 --> 00:53:33,247
I, uh, was doing
a report for school.

1004
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:35,247
Dr. Jonas said that you
should tell Tom and--

1005
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:37,147
Oh, cake!

1006
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,347
[Tom]
That's good. Can't make it
on brawn alone.

1007
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:40,828
I got to get
this one to bed.

1008
00:53:43,647 --> 00:53:45,402
I'm gonna, uh, go
get some fresh air.

1009
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:50,056
Oh, there we go.
You're a big boy.

1010
00:54:21,147 --> 00:54:22,513
The Studebaker parts
finally came.

1011
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:26,047
Water's stuck
in the pit again.

1012
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,052
Oh, yeah. We're gonna
have to get that fixed
one of these days.

1013
00:54:29,547 --> 00:54:30,906
Here you go.

1014
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:35,947
Quite a day, huh?

1015
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:38,347
I mean, with, uh, Stevie,

1016
00:54:38,347 --> 00:54:39,847
and plus it being
your birthday.

1017
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:40,378
Yeah.

1018
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,947
You know, Stevie talking...

1019
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:52,047
We've been hoping
for something like that
for...years.

1020
00:54:52,047 --> 00:54:52,631
Yeah, I know.

1021
00:54:56,047 --> 00:55:03,047
Well, Lori and I, uh--
your mom and I--

1022
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:05,747
Look, I remember
turning 18.

1023
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:07,747
I was still in foster care,

1024
00:55:07,747 --> 00:55:10,537
and I waited my whole life
for that birthday

1025
00:55:11,347 --> 00:55:12,647
so I could get out
on my own

1026
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,592
and stop bouncing
from place to place.

1027
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:20,647
Look, just because
you've turned 18,

1028
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:22,347
and legally
you're an adult,

1029
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:23,605
that doesn't mean
we're not family.

1030
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:29,447
Tom--

1031
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:30,712
Uh, Dad,

1032
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:34,647
there's stuff going on.

1033
00:55:34,647 --> 00:55:36,547
I'm really scared.

1034
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:38,255
I think there's
something wrong with me.

1035
00:55:39,847 --> 00:55:42,447
I mean, um...

1036
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:44,599
I'm afraid my parents
weren't normal.

1037
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:48,721
Aaron, you and I have talked
about how I was at your age.

1038
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,747
You know,
I stole, and I lied,

1039
00:55:52,747 --> 00:55:54,147
and I got kicked out
of every foster home

1040
00:55:54,147 --> 00:55:55,547
within a few months.

1041
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:56,447
I know, but--

1042
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:58,247
Wait, wait.
It's because I thought

1043
00:55:58,247 --> 00:56:00,747
my biological parents
were bad people.

1044
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:02,847
And I thought I was bad,

1045
00:56:02,847 --> 00:56:05,447
you know, like I didn't
have a choice.

1046
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:08,576
I was--I was a victim
of my own fear.

1047
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:11,347
You understand
what I'm saying?

1048
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:12,147
Yeah, but--

1049
00:56:12,147 --> 00:56:13,647
But then I started to see

1050
00:56:13,647 --> 00:56:15,747
that I was taking
the easy way:

1051
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,241
you know, blaming others
for how my life was going.

1052
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:22,762
But the only person
in charge of my life was me,

1053
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,147
and I had a choice.

1054
00:56:26,147 --> 00:56:28,947
You know, I could be
angry and resentful,

1055
00:56:28,947 --> 00:56:30,947
or I could work,

1056
00:56:30,947 --> 00:56:32,336
and create a life
that I could be proud of.

1057
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:37,347
But I think there's
something wrong with me.

1058
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,833
Aaron, there's nothing
wrong with you.

1059
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:43,524
You're human,
like all of us.

1060
00:56:46,147 --> 00:56:47,747
You're a good kid.

1061
00:56:47,747 --> 00:56:51,047
I mean,
you're a good man.

1062
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:53,547
You have refused to let
what happened to you

1063
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:54,358
define who you are.

1064
00:56:58,447 --> 00:56:59,931
I'm proud to have you
as my son.

1065
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:04,856
Come here.

1066
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:18,947
Hello.

1067
00:57:18,947 --> 00:57:20,647
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1068
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:22,747
I'm looking
for someone.

1069
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:24,447
Well,
I'm the only one here.

1070
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:26,347
How did you get in here?

1071
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:28,566
A boy. Just turned 18.

1072
00:57:29,147 --> 00:57:30,147
An orphan.

1073
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,690
He has...abilities.

1074
00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:36,146
I think you'd better leave.
There's no one here.

1075
00:57:36,147 --> 00:57:38,158
[telephone ringing]

1076
00:57:48,547 --> 00:57:50,147
It's the damnedest thing.

1077
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:51,947
I haven't seen
anything like it,

1078
00:57:51,947 --> 00:57:52,893
not in my entire life.

1079
00:57:55,147 --> 00:57:56,347
You know,
I never believed

1080
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,147
in spontaneous human
combustion before,

1081
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:00,947
but there's
no other explanation.

1082
00:58:00,947 --> 00:58:02,747
The guy was completely
incinerated.

1083
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:04,645
Just him and the phone.

1084
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:08,347
Fire doesn't work that way.

1085
00:58:08,347 --> 00:58:10,647
It's the damnedest thing.

1086
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:12,147
Excuse me.

1087
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:14,047
The doctor who works here,
is he okay?

1088
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:15,647
You family?

1089
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:18,247
He's my friend.

1090
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:20,206
I'm sorry, kid. I can't
say anything officially.

1091
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:24,128
We see Dr. Jonas?

1092
00:58:26,447 --> 00:58:28,347
No.

1093
00:58:28,347 --> 00:58:28,799
We don't.

1094
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:35,188
This is so screwed up.

1095
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:37,705
Who's gonna
believe me, huh?

1096
00:58:42,447 --> 00:58:44,091
All right, I'll be
right back, okay?

1097
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,447
Brady, have you seen
Vilma Rodriguez?

1098
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:59,347
You mean the girl you've
been pining over all year?

1099
00:58:59,347 --> 00:59:02,147
If you see her, tell her
I can't make study hall.

1100
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:02,818
Here, let me.

1101
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:09,747
Geez, Corbett, you ripped
the whole door off.

1102
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:10,747
What's with you?

1103
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,147
Hey, Corbett-hole, surprised
to see you at school.

1104
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:14,747
You been hiding or what?

1105
00:59:14,747 --> 00:59:16,147
Not now, Lockhart.

1106
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:18,047
Find Vilma,
and tell her I'll
talk to her later.

1107
00:59:18,047 --> 00:59:20,147
Don't turn
your back on me.

1108
00:59:20,147 --> 00:59:21,447
I'm just gonna get
the vice-principal.

1109
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:24,370
No. Brady, you intervene,
and you're next.

1110
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:25,847
Peter, don't do this,
okay?

1111
00:59:25,847 --> 00:59:26,409
You're dead.

1112
00:59:56,447 --> 00:59:57,487
You're a freak, Corbett.

1113
00:59:58,947 --> 00:59:59,668
How did you do that?

1114
01:00:03,247 --> 01:00:04,109
Honestly, I--

1115
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:06,714
I have no clue, man.

1116
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:09,847
Things
are really screwed up.

1117
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:10,997
I can't even...

1118
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:13,847
begin to explain.

1119
01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:14,521
Aaron.

1120
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:17,047
There you are.

1121
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,547
Hi.
Hi.

1122
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:21,447
Um, listen, I got to cancel
our study date.

1123
01:00:21,447 --> 01:00:23,747
I know. I figured you were
already in there.

1124
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:25,147
What? In where?

1125
01:00:25,147 --> 01:00:27,547
In the counselor's office.
They were looking for you.

1126
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:30,147
There's a guy here
from Cornell.

1127
01:00:30,147 --> 01:00:32,847
Oh, no, no, no.
Now is not a good time.

1128
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:34,147
Don't be silly.
You'll be fine.

1129
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:35,447
Just be yourself.

1130
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:39,347
New York, can you imagine?
That is so cool.

1131
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:40,947
I want to hear what happens
with the interview.

1132
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:43,547
I'm gonna be by the cafe
around 4 P.M.

1133
01:00:43,547 --> 01:00:44,723
You can tell me
all about it.

1134
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:20,668
Tree.

1135
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:22,647
Bird.

1136
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:23,747
[Tom]
"Significant improvement."

1137
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,047
That's what he said.

1138
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:27,547
I'll get out of work
and go with you.

1139
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:29,147
I'd like to check out
this new doctor.

1140
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:31,147
Aaron! Help Aaron!

1141
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:32,120
Oh! Hey, Stevie,
you're okay.

1142
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:43,647
?

1143
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:44,063
Just do it.

1144
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:53,317
What are you waiting for?

1145
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:56,547
Just do it.

1146
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:57,147
Kill me.

1147
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:57,945
Kill you?

1148
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,447
I've been looking for you
for centuries.

1149
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:02,879
I'm here to protect you.

1150
01:02:10,347 --> 01:02:12,047
There was a great battle.

1151
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:14,247
A mighty angel
convinced many followers

1152
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:17,747
to rebel against the teachings
of the Creator.

1153
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:18,947
Although these rebels
were strong,

1154
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:20,847
they did not win their fight.

1155
01:02:20,847 --> 01:02:22,747
They were banished
to the Earth.

1156
01:02:22,747 --> 01:02:23,630
Their wings were clipped.

1157
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:25,515
The Fallen.

1158
01:02:27,147 --> 01:02:28,647
You killed them.

1159
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:29,178
In the past.

1160
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:32,747
I thought it was
my holy mission

1161
01:02:32,747 --> 01:02:35,547
to eradicate the Fallen
and their offspring.

1162
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,847
You've eradicated
others like me?

1163
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:38,716
Yes, I have.

1164
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:41,447
Then why are you
so set on saving me?

1165
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:45,047
I mean, aren't I one
of your abominations?

1166
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:48,247
A prophet once said
that a Nephilim would be born

1167
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:51,147
who could forgive the Fallen
of their sins

1168
01:02:51,147 --> 01:02:54,647
so that they may
return to the Source.

1169
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:56,947
I saw that the Creator
had a plan

1170
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,547
much greater
than I could comprehend.

1171
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,947
After that, I could no longer
be a part of the killing,

1172
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:04,547
and I realized
that I had to save those

1173
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,810
the Powers
wished to destroy.

1174
01:03:07,847 --> 01:03:09,541
This is ridiculous.

1175
01:03:10,747 --> 01:03:11,547
What are you,
like, part

1176
01:03:11,547 --> 01:03:13,753
of the Angelic Witness
Protection Agency
or something?

1177
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:16,147
I don't understand.

1178
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:17,747
So basically,
I'm screwed.

1179
01:03:17,747 --> 01:03:19,647
I either go into hiding,

1180
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:21,947
or I'm killed
by fanatic angels.

1181
01:03:21,947 --> 01:03:23,147
That's--That's great.

1182
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:25,847
There is another thing.
I don't want to hear it.

1183
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:28,747
We have studied the signs
foretold by the prophet.

1184
01:03:28,747 --> 01:03:32,047
A child would be born
when the Sun was in Virgo.

1185
01:03:32,047 --> 01:03:34,547
The footprint of the father
would mark his birthplace

1186
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:37,047
and he would be called
as a Messenger.

1187
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,147
Get toto the point.

1188
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,014
These signs
have led us to you.

1189
01:03:42,547 --> 01:03:44,347
It is possible

1190
01:03:44,347 --> 01:03:46,279
that you are the one that
I have been searching for.

1191
01:03:48,847 --> 01:03:51,447
Okay, well, I hate
to break your bubble,

1192
01:03:51,447 --> 01:03:52,747
but I'm not, okay?

1193
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:55,047
Zeke fed me that whole
redeeming line too, and--

1194
01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:56,747
You've met Ezekiel?

1195
01:03:56,747 --> 01:03:59,347
Yeah. I tried the whole
redeeming thing on him,

1196
01:03:59,347 --> 01:04:01,347
and it didn't work.
I'm not your guy.

1197
01:04:01,347 --> 01:04:03,047
So why don't you
leave me alone, okay?

1198
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,647
Ezekiel is not
to be trusted.

1199
01:04:04,647 --> 01:04:06,347
According to Zeke,
neither are you.

1200
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:07,947
If Ezekiel knows
that you're here,

1201
01:04:07,947 --> 01:04:09,347
he will tell the Powers.

1202
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:10,747
Whether you are
the Redeemer or not,

1203
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:12,147
your life
is in grave danger.

1204
01:04:12,147 --> 01:04:14,947
I can protect you.
I can hide you.

1205
01:04:14,947 --> 01:04:17,147
There's no way.
They've killed
your friend Dr. Jonas.

1206
01:04:17,147 --> 01:04:17,947
Stop it.

1207
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:19,347
They have killed
my friend Samchial.

1208
01:04:19,347 --> 01:04:21,447
They will kill your family.
They will kill you.

1209
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:23,347
Stop it.

1210
01:04:23,347 --> 01:04:25,147
Look, I've been
kicked around

1211
01:04:25,147 --> 01:04:26,347
since I was a baby,

1212
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:27,847
one foster home
to another.

1213
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,121
and all I ever wanted
was a normal life.

1214
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:32,647
And now I'm graduating
high school,

1215
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:34,047
and colleges
are interested in me,

1216
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,547
and I have a family
that loves me,

1217
01:04:35,547 --> 01:04:39,547
and, you know, there's
this girl I just met--

1218
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:41,547
And all this angel stuff,
I--I just--

1219
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,836
I can't take it.

1220
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:44,752
I don't want
any part of it.

1221
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:48,347
You have no choice.

1222
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:50,247
I have no choice?

1223
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:51,747
Screw you.
I have a choice,

1224
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:53,647
and I'm choosing
to be rid of you

1225
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:54,847
and all this angel crap,

1226
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:56,947
so why don't you go
back to Heaven

1227
01:04:56,947 --> 01:04:58,464
and leave me
the hell alone?

1228
01:05:02,147 --> 01:05:03,083
As you wish.

1229
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,547
Ezekiel, my old friend,

1230
01:05:20,547 --> 01:05:24,047
and always as--[sniff]--
fragrant as ever.

1231
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:26,247
I thought I'd
stop by and say "hi,"

1232
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:27,426
talk over old times.

1233
01:05:28,247 --> 01:05:29,657
Oh, by the way,

1234
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:32,657
have you seen any Nephilim
in these parts?

1235
01:05:33,547 --> 01:05:35,747
Oh-ho-ho...

1236
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:37,644
They must have passed
right on by.

1237
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:40,647
Sorry.

1238
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:42,347
Come on, Ezekiel.

1239
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:45,347
We have always had
such a good arrangement.

1240
01:05:45,347 --> 01:05:48,247
Mutually beneficial,
wouldn't you say?

1241
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,647
You tell us
where the Nephilim are,

1242
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,547
and we let you live.

1243
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:53,891
Ohh...

1244
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,226
I...know nothing.

1245
01:05:58,947 --> 01:05:59,847
Oh, that's funny,

1246
01:05:59,847 --> 01:06:01,813
because his scent
is all over the place.

1247
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:04,547
And I find it
very interesting

1248
01:06:04,547 --> 01:06:07,447
that you gave up
your own child,

1249
01:06:07,447 --> 01:06:10,247
but this one
you protect.

1250
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:11,847
I haven't seen him.

1251
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:12,592
Hmm...

1252
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,847
I haven't seen him.

1253
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:17,413
Hmm.

1254
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:19,747
I...

1255
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:21,247
Non, s'il vous plat!

1256
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:22,947
[echoing]
Nephilim.

1257
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:24,542
Papa! Papa!

1258
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:26,487
Aaah!

1259
01:06:27,971 --> 01:06:29,513
[grunt]

1260
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:33,047
It's him, or it's you.

1261
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:34,010
Ohh...

1262
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:41,247
I'll tell Tom and Lori.

1263
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,047
They'll think I'm crazy,
but I have to.

1264
01:06:43,047 --> 01:06:43,747
[Gabriel]
Aaron, look out!

1265
01:06:43,747 --> 01:06:45,715
Oh-ho-ho. Whoa!

1266
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:49,447
What's wrong with you?

1267
01:06:49,447 --> 01:06:52,047
Uh, look, I'm, uh--

1268
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:53,047
Stupid idiot!

1269
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:54,847
Yeah, well,
nevertheless,

1270
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,547
uh, the Powers
are looking for you,

1271
01:06:56,547 --> 01:07:01,559
and I had to, uh, well,
tell 'em where you live, so--

1272
01:07:02,547 --> 01:07:05,447
You sent killer angels
to my house?

1273
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:06,647
What about my family?

1274
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,047
That's a good point,
That's a good point.

1275
01:07:08,047 --> 01:07:09,747
Now, if you're lucky,

1276
01:07:09,747 --> 01:07:13,647
Verchiel will spend time
questioning and...

1277
01:07:13,647 --> 01:07:15,247
killing 'em--
nicely, I'm sure--

1278
01:07:15,247 --> 01:07:17,647
and then you'll have
time to escape.
What?

1279
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:21,047
Yes. Well, they're
not your family anyway.

1280
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:23,147
I love them.
Oh, that's sweet.

1281
01:07:23,147 --> 01:07:26,247
I'm sure they appreciate it,
but you better run right now.

1282
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:28,247
I'm not gonna run.
I'm not a coward like you.

1283
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:31,547
Courage
is vastly overrated.

1284
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,947
Why are you doing this?

1285
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:34,547
I am not
your precious Redeemer.

1286
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:37,647
I'm doing this
to help you out.

1287
01:07:37,647 --> 01:07:39,847
Now just run.
You disgust me.

1288
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,147
I'd rather love and die
than live and hate myself.

1289
01:07:42,147 --> 01:07:42,847
Oh, that's beautiful.

1290
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:45,647
If it's me they want,
it's me they'll get.

1291
01:07:45,647 --> 01:07:47,147
I'm not gonna let them
hurt my family.

1292
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:48,447
come on ?

1293
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:49,647
Wait a minute. Wait!

1294
01:07:49,647 --> 01:07:50,747
Hey, hold on just a second.

1295
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:53,347
Now, what about--

1296
01:07:53,347 --> 01:07:54,165
What about me?

1297
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:03,649
Lori?

1298
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:05,417
Tom?

1299
01:08:13,347 --> 01:08:14,847
Aaron, we get out of here.

1300
01:08:14,847 --> 01:08:16,179
Lori! Tom!

1301
01:08:21,047 --> 01:08:22,647
Aaron, what's going on?

1302
01:08:22,647 --> 01:08:24,347
What is this slamming?
What is going on?

1303
01:08:24,347 --> 01:08:26,347
Listen! Go back
into the basement!

1304
01:08:26,347 --> 01:08:27,847
Angels! Angels! Angels!
Lock the door!

1305
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:29,047
Don't come out,
no matter what you hear.

1306
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:29,882
But, Aaron--

1307
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:34,147
Just do this for me,
please.

1308
01:08:34,147 --> 01:08:34,988
okay okay

1309
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:36,753
Wait.

1310
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:42,047
Just go.
Just go, please.

1311
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:42,691
Okay.

1312
01:08:45,347 --> 01:08:47,647
Protect them.
Don't let them get hurt.

1313
01:08:47,647 --> 01:08:49,562
[Verchiel]
Come, Nephilim!

1314
01:08:51,947 --> 01:08:53,547
Gabriel protect.

1315
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:54,357
Aaron's fine.

1316
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:56,498
It's okay.

1317
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:10,914
[echoing voice]
Come, Nephilim!

1318
01:09:15,747 --> 01:09:16,854
Meet your death!

1319
01:09:18,747 --> 01:09:20,347
Kid, go back!

1320
01:09:20,347 --> 01:09:22,202
Run for it!
Go now!

1321
01:09:25,847 --> 01:09:28,747
[Verchiel]
Kushiel, kill Ezekiel!

1322
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,676
Grrr!

1323
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:34,272
Aah!

1324
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:50,997
?

1325
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:04,244
Leave him alone.

1326
01:10:05,647 --> 01:10:06,470
It's me you want.

1327
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:07,959
Yes, it is!

1328
01:10:08,447 --> 01:10:11,347
Look, I don't want
anything to do

1329
01:10:11,347 --> 01:10:13,747
with angels or prophesies.

1330
01:10:13,747 --> 01:10:15,547
So just leave me
and my family alone,

1331
01:10:15,547 --> 01:10:18,647
and we won't bother you.
I promise.

1332
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:20,032
Oh, you promise!

1333
01:10:20,247 --> 01:10:23,247
Ha ha ha!
The abomination bargains!

1334
01:10:23,247 --> 01:10:24,268
How amusing!

1335
01:10:25,747 --> 01:10:26,593
He's yours.

1336
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:30,619
Must save Aaron.

1337
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:34,496
Raah!

1338
01:10:44,847 --> 01:10:47,547
Traitor!

1339
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:48,878
You deserve to die!

1340
01:10:50,547 --> 01:10:52,447
He is the Redeemer.

1341
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:55,077
The Redeemer?
You can't be serious!

1342
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:04,947
Ha! Ha! Haah!

1343
01:11:04,947 --> 01:11:06,085
Aah!

1344
01:11:12,947 --> 01:11:13,764
Peniel!

1345
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:17,021
Raah!

1346
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:21,820
Aah! Aah! Aahr!

1347
01:11:27,447 --> 01:11:28,985
Go. Go get a weapon.

1348
01:11:29,547 --> 01:11:30,947
How?

1349
01:11:30,947 --> 01:11:32,005
See it in your mind.

1350
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:36,962
Your turn.

1351
01:11:41,347 --> 01:11:43,580
Raah! Ha! Ha! Aah!

1352
01:11:46,747 --> 01:11:47,469
Aahhh...

1353
01:11:59,147 --> 01:11:59,873
Ooohh...

1354
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:06,459
Aaarh!

1355
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:16,845
Aarh! Aah! Aah!

1356
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:20,744
Aargh!

1357
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:24,579
Raah! Aah!

1358
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:27,485
Aah!

1359
01:12:55,347 --> 01:12:57,147
Mama's gonna
touch you, baby.

1360
01:12:57,147 --> 01:12:58,124
There we go.

1361
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:02,556
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1362
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:13,359
Aah!

1363
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:52,155
Stop! You can't
kill the Redeemer!

1364
01:13:52,747 --> 01:13:55,347
He's part of the Creator's
divine plan!

1365
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,947
Him? You're not
just a traitor,

1366
01:13:57,947 --> 01:13:59,147
you're also a fool.

1367
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:02,447
Look at him! Has anyone
ever fought back before?

1368
01:14:02,447 --> 01:14:04,147
Can't you feel
his presence?

1369
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:05,928
Tell me this
isn't different.

1370
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,747
You almost had me.

1371
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,550
[Camael]
No!

1372
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:19,232
Oh!

1373
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:32,985
Oh, my God! Aaron!

1374
01:14:33,747 --> 01:14:37,447
Aaron! Angel!
Aaron! Angel!

1375
01:14:37,447 --> 01:14:38,947
Aaron!

1376
01:14:38,947 --> 01:14:40,047
[Stevie]
Aaron! Angel!

1377
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:42,640
Aaron! Aaron!

1378
01:14:46,747 --> 01:14:48,547
So much for your prophesy.

1379
01:14:48,547 --> 01:14:49,151
What have you done?

1380
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:53,459
Aaron!

1381
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:56,374
Angel! Aaron!

1382
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:58,247
Aaron! Trapped!

1383
01:14:58,247 --> 01:14:59,847
[Lori]
Open up!

1384
01:14:59,847 --> 01:15:01,047
Aaron!

1385
01:15:01,047 --> 01:15:02,647
Aaron!
We're trapped!

1386
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:03,741
Aaron!

1387
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,567
Uh...

1388
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:28,105
Thank you.

1389
01:15:52,547 --> 01:15:54,047
I misjudged you.

1390
01:15:54,047 --> 01:15:55,647
I was waiting for a sign.

1391
01:15:55,647 --> 01:15:57,330
I--I understand now.

1392
01:16:01,947 --> 01:16:04,647
Fine. You go ahead,
and you get rid of me,

1393
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:06,747
but that is not gonna
solve your problem.

1394
01:16:06,747 --> 01:16:08,847
The Powers will never
let you roam this planet.

1395
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:10,458
They will hunt you down.

1396
01:16:12,547 --> 01:16:14,747
And you will have to leave.

1397
01:16:14,747 --> 01:16:16,649
Your family will never
be safe with you here.

1398
01:16:22,747 --> 01:16:23,947
Aaron!

1399
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:24,669
[Gabriel]
Aaron, look out!

1400
01:16:28,347 --> 01:16:29,569
Agrrr!

1401
01:16:39,047 --> 01:16:40,847
He stood you up.

1402
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:42,447
Something
could have happened.

1403
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:43,642
I'll give him
ten more minutes.

1404
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:45,700
It's almost 5.

1405
01:16:47,347 --> 01:16:48,589
I'll wait for him
a little longer.

1406
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:00,047
[Aaron]
Zeke.

1407
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:01,847
You came back.
You surprised me.

1408
01:17:01,847 --> 01:17:03,847
Yeah...

1409
01:17:03,847 --> 01:17:05,439
I surprised myself.

1410
01:17:09,547 --> 01:17:11,752
Oh, no. Don't touch me.

1411
01:17:13,247 --> 01:17:16,547
If you use your powers,
it's like a beacon.

1412
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,815
They may send someone
back to look for you.

1413
01:17:20,347 --> 01:17:23,147
It is true.

1414
01:17:23,147 --> 01:17:24,847
But don't they
already know?

1415
01:17:24,847 --> 01:17:26,647
If you forsake your powers,

1416
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:29,047
you can save the life
you have here.

1417
01:17:29,047 --> 01:17:32,447
If not, you will become
what you were born to be:

1418
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,503
the Redeemer.

1419
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:41,247
Zeke.

1420
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,172
I want the truth.

1421
01:17:43,947 --> 01:17:46,281
Do you regret letting others
die so you could live?

1422
01:17:49,647 --> 01:17:50,230
Yes.

1423
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:57,209
So would I.

1424
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,336
Hey.

1425
01:18:41,747 --> 01:18:43,927
Open up! Aaron!

1426
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:46,089
Come back!

1427
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:47,334
I'm going away now.

1428
01:18:48,647 --> 01:18:49,378
No.

1429
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:52,438
But I'll always
be with you, okay?

1430
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:54,847
Aaron.

1431
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:56,122
[Lori]
Aaron!
Angel.

1432
01:18:58,447 --> 01:18:59,976
[Lori]
Aaron!

1433
01:19:00,947 --> 01:19:01,594
Here.

1434
01:19:06,547 --> 01:19:08,655
Aaron. Angel.

1435
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:12,347
[Lori]
Aaron!The longer you stay,

1436
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,589
the greater the danger.

1437
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:16,486
I'll come back.

1438
01:19:18,347 --> 01:19:19,416
I promise.

1439
01:19:21,547 --> 01:19:23,554
[Lori]
Gabe? Gabe?

1440
01:19:23,947 --> 01:19:24,721
Can you hear me?
Come here, boy.

1441
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,387
Tell Mom and Dad
that I love them, okay?

1442
01:19:51,447 --> 01:19:52,093
Lori!

1443
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,712
Lori.

1444
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,255
Hey, hey, it's Aaron.

1445
01:20:10,255 --> 01:20:12,130
There's something horrible
that's happening.

1446
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:13,947
What is going on?
Where's Aaron?

1447
01:20:13,947 --> 01:20:14,747
I don't know--

1448
01:20:14,747 --> 01:20:17,022
Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!

1449
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,500
Aaron!

1450
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:26,576
Hey.

1451
01:21:22,547 --> 01:21:24,185
It has been said
they walk among us...

1452
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:27,287
that they guide us.

1453
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:29,956
It could be the banker...

1454
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:32,824
the girl next door...

1455
01:21:35,347 --> 01:21:36,359
or the cop on the beat.

1456
01:21:39,147 --> 01:21:40,913
But I know now
that some tempt us.

1457
01:21:43,047 --> 01:21:44,829
They even destroy
what we believe in.

1458
01:21:47,047 --> 01:21:48,434
My future is not my own.

1459
