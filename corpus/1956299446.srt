1
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,123
- All right, ladies,
here we go.

2
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:24,542
Get ready.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:25,876
Everything's set.

4
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:28,795
Yeah.

5
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:45,980
# Never know how much I love you

6
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,441
# Never know how much I care

7
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,528
# When you put your arms around me

8
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:55,447
# I get a fever that's
so hard to bear

9
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,994
# You give me fever
when you kiss me

10
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,581
# Fever when you hold me tight

11
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:07,168
# Fever in the mornin'

12
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,088
# Fever all through the night

13
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:14,175
# Sun lights up the day time

14
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,553
# Moon lights up the night

15
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:20,681
# I light up when you call my name

16
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,767
# And you know I'm gonna
treat you right

17
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:28,314
# You give me fever
when you kiss me

18
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:31,859
# Fever when you hold me tight

19
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:35,362
# Fever in the mornin'

20
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,533
# Fever all through the night

21
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,912
# Everybody's got the fever

22
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:46,624
# That is somethin' you all know

23
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:49,793
# Fever isn't such a new thing

24
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:53,088
# Fever started long ago

25
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:02,013
Bye Scott.

26
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,014
Bye Scott, thanks. - Goodbye.

27
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,015
See ya GUYS-

28
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,141
# Juliet, she felt

29
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:06,936
So, what'd you think?

30
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,438
- I think you're even sexier
with your clothes on.

31
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:10,940
- Does that mean I can
spend the night?

32
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,567
- Only if you promise to respect
me in the morning.

33
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,819
- I promise to be horny
in the morning.

34
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:17,153
Works for me.

35
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,420
Oh god, that's great.

36
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:38,883
Lena.

37
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,805
Heard any good screw jokes lately?

38
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:44,765
Oh god, Scott.

39
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:48,060
Come on.

40
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:50,437
How many feminists does it take to
screw in a light bulb?

41
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:53,481
How many?

42
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,441
Three.

43
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:57,820
One to screw in the bulb,

44
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:02,408
and two to discuss the violation
of the socket.

45
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:03,741
That sucks.

46
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,575
I know.

47
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,915
- How many pessimists does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

48
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,927
You're devastating.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,015
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

50
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:29,810
- No, no, no, no, no, no, Lena,
I'm wasted.

51
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,144
I gotta some sleep.

52
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,940
Sleep is for wimps.

53
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,138
Scott.

54
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,064
Scott!

55
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:41,816
Scott, Scott!

56
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:47,155
Scott!

57
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:49,366
You tried to strangle me.

58
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,327
Your hand was around my throat,
Scott, I couldn't breathe.

59
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,370
But I almost came.

60
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:03,255
Hey, don't worry, I've inspired
dirty dreams before.

61
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:46,673
# You are in my shadow

62
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,760
You've already done 200.

63
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,470
Jeez, relax.

64
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,138
Shut up and eat your pizza.

65
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,892
God, you look like shit.

66
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,226
Yeah, I didn't sleep last night.

67
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,686
She snored, huh?

68
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,020
Bad dream.

69
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:02,648
Yeah, it's always a nightmare

70
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,942
when they wanna talk afterwards.

71
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,944
Saw myself kill a woman.

72
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:10,489
- Yeah, it was probably
your future ex-wife.

73
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:11,865
Hey, give me a break.

74
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,201
Okay, okay.

75
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,495
- It wasn't like a dream,
you know, man?

76
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,455
It was too real.

77
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,251
I was walkin' down this hallway
in somebody's house.

78
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,920
This girl's takin' a shower, I
open the shower door,

79
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,922
and I start strangling her.

80
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,093
- So, you had nightmare,
what's the big deal?

81
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:32,426
- The big deal is that
when I woke up,

82
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,304
I was actually choking the
girl next to me.

83
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:35,638
Jesus.

84
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:37,849
What happened?

85
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:39,560
She was all right.

86
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,728
I took a cold shower and never
went back to sleep.

87
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,397
You just got laid, didn't ya?

88
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,023
- What's that got
to do with it?

89
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:46,650
Everything.

90
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:48,819
You were beat, your mind was
playing games with ya.

91
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,152
That's all it was.

92
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,155
Yeah, you're probably right.

93
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,702
- Scotty, you ever have
a secret desire

94
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:58,036
to make it with your mother?

95
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,291
Thanks.

96
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,209
- Well, there are all kinds
of explanations

97
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,087
for recurring dreams.

98
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,798
I'm not gonna come up with
something off the top of my head.

99
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,968
How rational are they?

100
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,220
- Well, you have to understand
that we're dealing

101
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:21,722
with a subject for which

102
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,557
there are not many
rational answers.

103
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,061
- I was thinking, I had a
motorcycle accident a while back,

104
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,063
bad one, no helmet,

105
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:32,983
and I spent a little time
in intensive care.

106
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:36,737
Could this be some kind of a
post-trauma thing?

107
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,070
It's a possibility.

108
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:42,159
You ever have nightmares?

109
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,245
Just the usual kind, you know,

110
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,664
falling, childhood monsters,
things like that.

111
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,207
- Plus, all the dreams
you've forgotten.

112
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,709
Not these dreams, Doctor.

113
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,544
You don't forget these dreams.

114
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,046
- Okay, the centerpiece
for your dreams

115
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,258
is a woman, the same woman.

116
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,594
The method of murder is different,
right?

117
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:01,927
Right.

118
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,763
- Do you
recognize the woman?

119
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
Not consciously.

120
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,684
- Do you see yourself
in the dream?

121
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,103
I don't think so.

122
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,646
- Then why do you think you're
doing the killing?

123
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,440
I don't see it, I feel it.

124
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,778
It's hard to explain.

125
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:22,115
I feel myself walking
down that hallway.

126
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:27,204
I, I, I feel myself in the body
moving into the bathroom.

127
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,666
No, I'm the one who's
doing those murders.

128
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:35,378
I woke up and I was actually
choking the woman next to me.

129
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:38,256
- Well, that could be a
simple reflex action.

130
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,051
See, dreams that generate this
kind of powerful emotion

131
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:43,762
occasionally will
manifest themselves

132
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,597
with equally strong
kinetic activity.

133
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,309
Tell me about the other dream.

134
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,313
It was a knife, jagged edge.

135
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:55,773
I saw my hand-

136
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,024
Or somebody's hand.

137
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,275
But it felt like,

138
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,487
I felt like it was me
doing the stabbing.

139
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,157
Did it give you pleasure?

140
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,491
No.

141
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,160
It scared me.

142
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,204
The woman's scream woke me up.

143
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,664
So, the dream frightens you.

144
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,167
You don't associate the
murder with pleasure.

145
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,296
I wouldn't worry about it.

146
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,673
There's no way that I'm
gonna interpret

147
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,301
that you're harboring some bizarre
homicidal tendencies

148
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,387
in your subconscious.

149
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,138
Could be something
very complicated,

150
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,807
or something as simple as stress.

151
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,520
In any case, I'm glad you decided
to talk to somebody.

152
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,313
What about a CAT scan?

153
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:36,647
Well, CAT scans are for people

154
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:38,024
with serious brain problems.

155
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,236
What you need is a good
night's sleep.

156
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,446
Don't deliberately try
to stay awake.

157
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,990
Don't shy away from the dream.

158
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:47,075
Chances are you may not
even have it again,

159
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:50,871
but if you do, don't fight
the damn thing.

160
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,540
Try to make peace with it.

161
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,018
- How's the Boston
Strangler tonight?

162
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:17,480
You're not thrilled to see me?

163
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,649
Not a good day, what's up?

164
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,276
You're outta salami,

165
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,529
your Jack cheese is growing green
fur, you got no lettuce,

166
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,364
and you need mayo and tomato.

167
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:28,657
- I'm glad you're
enjoying your dinner.

168
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,118
Where you been all evening?

169
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,040
Hot date or somethin'?

170
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:36,373
Right.

171
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,127
Why didn't you bring her home?

172
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,171
I was with a shrink, Phil.

173
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:42,631
I heard they give good head.

174
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:44,674
Do me a favor, pal.

175
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,303
- Shut up and get the
fuck outta here.

176
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:50,138
Just shut up.

177
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:54,976
And, uh, spend the night here,
okay?

178
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:57,645
<i>_ okay-</i>

179
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,444
So, this dream thing's
really got ya paranoid.

180
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:06,738
Just curious.

181
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,365
The shrink couldn't help me out.

182
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:09,783
Gotta draw my own conclusions.

183
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,116
Which are?

184
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,330
Maybe I'm not just dreaming.

185
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:16,664
<i>_ okay-</i>

186
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,210
Maybe that girl really exists.

187
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:26,299
I, I checked newspaper articles
going back three years.

188
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:30,428
No pictures, no mention of a girl
like her being murdered.

189
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:32,055
<i>_ okay-</i>

190
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:33,598
- So, that rules out my
being influenced

191
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,559
by something that I've
seen or read.

192
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:39,396
- With the exception of Friday
the 13th, Jagged Edge,

193
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,606
and about 500 other movies.

194
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,150
- No, no, this dream is too
consistent in detail.

195
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:48,113
Everything, same house, same
furniture, same girl.

196
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:50,740
Only the murders are different.

197
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,119
So, hit me with the heavy stuff.

198
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,959
- What if there's this killer,
real killer out there

199
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:05,547
who's thinkin' about, planning
to kill that girl?

200
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:11,469
What if I'm somehow
intercepting his thoughts?

201
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:14,389
- I think you and Brian De Palma
should get together.

202
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:00,662
You are one useless human machine.

203
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:01,995
Fuck you.

204
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:06,543
- I now leave you alone to the
misery of your feeble body

205
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,920
and your victory over your
worst nightmare.

206
00:17:09,254 --> 00:17:13,591
- You know, for an ape, you can be
quite poetic sometimes.

207
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:17,512
Oh, well, thank you, thank you.

208
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,932
Anytime you got a bad dream,
give me a call.

209
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,476
They don't call me the head
doctor for nothin'.

210
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,237
- Good morning, will you hold
those messages, sweetheart.

211
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:35,571
I don't wanna see 'em just yet.

212
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:36,656
Good morning.

213
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,990
Hi, Scott. - How are we?

214
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,199
Hi. - Ooh, you guys look great.

215
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:39,867
You all ready?

216
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:40,910
Yeah. - Good.

217
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,244
Hey, Paul.

218
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:43,162
Yeah, hi, Scott.

219
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:43,954
How long we got?

220
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:44,997
Five minutes.

221
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:45,789
Four.

222
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:46,665
Four minutes.

223
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,583
Four minutes, beautiful.

224
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:48,876
Tiffany, will you put
this stuff away?

225
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:49,877
Thanks.

226
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,339
How are you lovely things?

227
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,716
You guys look great.

228
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,102
Okay, nice, nice.

229
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,651
Come one, there you go,
that's right.

230
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:14,985
Good, good, good, good.

231
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,282
Okay now, there you go, right,
yeah, another one.

232
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:21,117
Another one, good, good, good,
good.

233
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:36,633
No, no sweetheart, that's
not what I need.

234
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,680
Okay, look, what I want you to do
is I want you to turn.

235
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:45,391
Right, now bring your face back.

236
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:48,937
That's right, good, that's nice.

237
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,732
- Come on, Scott, what are
you waiting for?

238
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,693
Come on, what are you waiting for?

239
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,571
Come on, Scott, what are
you waiting for?

240
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,489
- What's wrong with you?
- Click it.

241
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:24,866
Come on, Scott,

242
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,409
what are you waiting for? -
What's wrong with him?

243
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:27,743
- Come on, Scott,
what are you waiting for?

244
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:28,827
Click it.

245
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,037
- Come on, Scott. - What's
wrong with him?

246
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,246
- Come on, Scott. - What are
you waiting for?

247
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:32,248
What are you waiting for?

248
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:33,582
- What's wrong? - What are
you waiting for?

249
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:34,207
Click it.

250
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,417
- Come on, Scott. - What's
wrong with him?

251
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,753
Click it. - Come on, Scott.

252
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,129
What are you waiting for? -
What's wrong with him?

253
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,463
- Click it. - What are
you waiting for?

254
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:40,798
- What's wrong with him? -
Come on, Scott.

255
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,132
- What happened to you,
sweetheart?

256
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,176
Hey Scott, you blacked out.

257
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,844
Are you doing drugs?

258
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,178
- Give him a break, you guys,
he's had a hard day.

259
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:47,429
How 'bout a cup of tea?

260
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:48,638
Don't fucking touch me.

261
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,184
Just stay away, just stay away.

262
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:54,936
Just taking your fucking clothes

263
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:56,564
and get out of here. - Oh my god.

264
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,191
Jeez. - You're outta your mind.

265
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,861
What is your- - What's the
matter with you?

266
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,072
What's the matter with you, Scott?

267
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:05,907
- God, Scott. - What is
your problem?

268
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,002
- There's nothing here, Scott,
it's normal.

269
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:20,755
- So, what are you saying,
I'm goin' nuts?

270
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:22,089
Of course not.

271
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,132
A few nightmares never
killed anybody.

272
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:27,720
- I was wide awake, I was
in that house.

273
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,389
It's no longer a nightmare.

274
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:30,890
Maybe these things

275
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,726
are hallucinatory
extensions of your dreams.

276
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,436
Maybe you're experiencing some

277
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,314
post-traumatic reaction
to your accident.

278
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:40,566
Maybe you oughta take a vacation.

279
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,693
- Take two Valium and call
me in the morning.

280
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,738
- What I am gonna do is to give
you a mild muscle relaxant.

281
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,072
Just don't overdo it.

282
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:49,534
Take the normal dosage for
a couple of days.

283
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:53,955
You can call me if there's any
problem, side effects.

284
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,250
Call me anyway.

285
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,001
Yeah, cancel that one too.

286
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,964
Right, I know, I know, I'll never
work in this town again.

287
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,259
Bullshit.

288
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,177
Wednesday, the beer stuff?

289
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:09,511
Well, postpone that.

290
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,932
Well, if they don't go for it,
just cancel.

291
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,809
I don't give a fuck
what you tell 'em.

292
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:17,019
Just, you know, you
get paid to lie.

293
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:21,983
Well, between herpes and
dead grandmother,

294
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:24,735
I'm sure you're gonna come
up with somethin'.

295
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,069
Yeah.

296
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:46,107
Hey.

297
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:48,652
H9)'-

298
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,072
Look at me.

299
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:52,405
I'm lookin'.

300
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:53,866
Do I look crazy to you?

301
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Yeah.

302
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:57,244
Thank you.

303
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:58,161
No problem.

304
00:23:58,361 --> 00:23:59,664
Hey, ypu got a quarter?

305
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,501
Fuckin' A, man.

306
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:46,835
Which one?

307
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:47,794
Pepperoni.

308
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:53,092
I like the pineapple.

309
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,595
Pineapple's no good.

310
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:27,209
- Warned ya, man, pineapple
gives ya the shits.

311
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:28,544
Gotta make a run at Seaport.

312
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,087
- Hey, hey, can I talk to you
guys for a minute?

313
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:31,422
Yeah, what's up, man?

314
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:35,885
- I'm sorry to bother ya, but
this, you know this girl?

315
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:38,428
No.

316
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:39,930
Why?

317
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:42,058
That's a hand-painted shirt.

318
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:43,391
So?

319
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:44,601
Where'd you get it?

320
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:47,688
Hey, goin' somewhere, pal?

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,001
- You ain't gonna shoot me,
are ya, man?

322
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,295
- You crazy cocksucker, I'm
not gonna shoot you.

323
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:55,672
You ain't a cop?

324
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,093
You dumb fuck, I'm not a cop.

325
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:00,427
What'd you do?

326
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,722
You stole this, didn't ya?

327
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,015
None of your fuckin' business.

328
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:06,767
- Okay, I said I
wouldn't shoot you.

329
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:09,311
I didn't say I wouldn't
break your neck.

330
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:11,272
Okay, okay, I stole it.

331
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:14,191
I stole 20 more of 'em too,
so what?

332
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:15,526
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

333
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,154
I get this and you get this,

334
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:21,365
and then you tell me exactly
where you stole it from.

335
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,243
What if I don't?

336
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,162
Then I will break your neck.

337
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,918
# I don't want nobody

338
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:38,007
# Tellin' me what to do

339
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,052
# Well, the get beside themselves

340
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:45,514
# And I don't go for that

341
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:48,558
Great place you got here.

342
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,601
Yeah.

343
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:51,728
How can I help you?

344
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,024
- Well, I was wonderin', do you
have any more of these?

345
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,026
# I'll tend to mine

346
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,695
- Ah, I'm sorry, that's
hand-painted, one of a kind.

347
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,865
# Tellin' me what to do

348
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:09,413
- Damn, I wanted another one, I
really liked the artwork.

349
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:10,747
Thank you.

350
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:11,831
Oh, you did this?

351
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,420
It's a beautiful girl, is, um,
she a model?

352
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:18,588
Why?

353
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:19,715
I'm a fashion photographer.

354
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,926
This girl has a very
unique quality,

355
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:25,054
and I thought, you know, maybe
she's in the business.

356
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,387
I wouldn't really know.

357
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:27,223
But you painted her.

358
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,391
- Yeah, but my man, I paint a lot
of different things.

359
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:31,519
Mostly from memory, I
don't use models.

360
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,229
Now, this girl you're
trying to find.

361
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:35,189
Jeez, I mighta seen her months
or even years ago.

362
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:37,233
Mighta seen a picture
in a magazine.

363
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:39,276
Maybe even had a dream about her.

364
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,610
You saw her in a dream.

365
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:43,364
- Now, look, I don't know
where I saw her.

366
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:44,697
Let's just say I invented her,

367
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,367
and we'll leave it at that, okay?

368
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,285
Can I ask ya another question?

369
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:49,619
Sure, why not?

370
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:51,288
That's all you've done
since you walked up.

371
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:54,166
- Have you had any kinda odd
dreams lately, you know,

372
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,001
different than usual?

373
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,879
- My dreams are all exactly the
same, dull, colorless.

374
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,550
Are you finished now, Dr. Freud?

375
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:06,595
- So, uh, you wouldn't know
this girl's name?

376
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,808
- Nor her address or her
astrological sign or anything else.

377
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,436
I suggest you find somebody
else to obsess on.

378
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,357
- Well, my studio's
pretty nearby here.

379
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,776
If you do happen to remember
anything about her,

380
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,403
would ya at least give me a call?

381
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:08,991
- Oh, I didn't bring any
wine or anything.

382
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:10,367
Oh, wine I got, come on in.

383
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,870
Look at that.

384
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,415
You okay?

385
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,208
I think so.

386
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,169
I'm just surprised you
invited me to dinner.

387
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:21,502
Why?

388
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:23,130
- Because I'm a one
night kinda girl.

389
00:30:23,464 --> 00:30:25,758
I usually get invited to dinner
before, not after.

390
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,091
Well, with me, it's different.

391
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,259
Come on, sit down.

392
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,805
Tonight, we go to Greece.

393
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:34,266
First stop, the island of Corfu

394
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,353
where the chef recommends
pheasant salad,

395
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:41,690
vine leaves stuffed with rice,
calamari, ouzo.

396
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,778
- The sights and smells of
the Mediterranean.

397
00:30:56,163 --> 00:30:57,289
Mm.

398
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,333
I got a little something for ya.

399
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,877
Designer condoms, right?

400
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:05,506
- Lena, it wouldn't kill ya just
to be a tiny bit romantic.

401
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,839
Come on, open 'em.

402
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,551
Put it on.

403
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:12,346
It's beautiful, but why?

404
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,015
- I just felt terrible about
the other night,

405
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:18,102
and I wanted to do something
to make it up to ya.

406
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:19,435
God, you didn't have to do that.

407
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:21,355
I was yours for the taking.

408
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:24,358
Thank you, really.

409
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,499
Oh shit.

410
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:50,551
That was breakfast, I gotta go.

411
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:51,884
What time is it?

412
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,304
7:30, time to make a living.

413
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,183
Listen, next time, dinner's on me.

414
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,519
If there's no next time, thanks,
it was great.

415
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:03,646
Bye.

416
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,321
Are you Scott Bruin?

417
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:37,825
Well?

418
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:39,201
Are you Scott Bruin?

419
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,286
Yes.

420
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:43,705
My name is Kimberly Shawn,

421
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,541
and I want you to tell the
man who hired you

422
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:47,042
that he's wasting his money

423
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:50,129
because we're through and he's
never going to see me again.

424
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,756
It's over, it's been
over for a year,

425
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,135
and hiring two-bit private dicks
won't do him any good.

426
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,720
You tell him that for me,
all right?

427
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:00,054
Wait, wait, wait.

428
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:01,557
Keep your hands off me.

429
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,559
I'm sorry.

430
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:05,519
But it isn't like ya think.

431
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:07,646
Just give him my message.

432
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,189
<i>' Who?</i>

433
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:11,733
- Is he also paying you
to act stupid?

434
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,653
- No, nobody's paying
me for anything.

435
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:17,614
I'm not, I'm not a
private investigator.

436
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:19,199
Right.

437
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,201
- I'm telling you the truth,
I'm a photographer.

438
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:22,535
Really, look.

439
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,666
If, if you just come in, I
can prove it to ya.

440
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,838
Is it safe to come in.

441
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:38,051
- Oh, I was just trying to take a
shower when you showed up.

442
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,182
Leave the door open.

443
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,278
All right, let's say you
are a photographer,

444
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:58,113
why are you trying to find me?

445
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:00,490
I'm not, I mean, I wasn't.

446
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:04,161
Okay, I bought a t-shirt that
had your face on it,

447
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,622
and uh, I thought you had an
interesting look.

448
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:08,123
I'm a fashion photographer,

449
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:11,668
and I asked the guy who
painted it who you were,

450
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,545
and he told me that you
didn't exist.

451
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,172
Rudy knows my ex-husband.

452
00:35:15,505 --> 00:35:17,132
He's just being protective.

453
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:18,842
So, I'm not the bad guy anymore?

454
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,888
- Is it safe to leave
my bike outside?

455
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:25,515
No, not in this neighborhood.

456
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:27,725
Be right back.

457
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,001
Got any coffee?

458
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:04,346
That's your third one.

459
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,141
You drink too much coffee.

460
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:09,475
I didn't sleep too well.

461
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:10,726
- Not that it's any
of my business,

462
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,396
but you're a nervous wreck.

463
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:13,729
Thank you.

464
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:15,648
Can I buy you dinner?

465
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:16,565
I've got plans.

466
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:17,483
Lunch.

467
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:18,276
Meeting a friend.

468
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,193
How 'bout an ice cream?

469
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,445
What time is it?

470
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:21,947
It's a few minutes before 11.

471
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,281
Out of the question.

472
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:25,826
So, what's with the accent?

473
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:28,996
What accent?

474
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,665
Brazilian father, I
grew up in Rio,

475
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,668
and by the time Mother claimed me,
I was 17.

476
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:36,169
Then I married a Frenchman.

477
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:38,297
That didn't do much for
my accent either.

478
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,673
So, how long were you married.

479
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,007
Three weeks.

480
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,135
That's not very long.

481
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,761
Three weeks with a Frenchman,

482
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:46,972
as close you can get
to an eternity.

483
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,766
From honeymoon to divorce, huh?

484
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:54,604
- From Monte Carlo to Paris and
from gambling to solicitors.

485
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:57,816
So, did you love him?

486
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,278
- I was sexually attached to
him for a while.

487
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:04,323
- Sexual attachments
don't last long.

488
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,533
If he's still chasing you,
he's still in love.

489
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:09,036
We always fall in love

490
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:10,996
with what we don't have
or can't have.

491
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,333
So, what are we doing for lunch?

492
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,210
- I thought you were
meeting a friend.

493
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:19,004
It's a big restaurant.

494
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:33,018
- I think you're going to like the
smoked chicken salad

495
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,729
and the Champagne grapes are
simply delicious.

496
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:37,063
Great.

497
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,819
- What do you think of Kimberly,
Scott?

498
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:44,446
What do I think of Kimberly?

499
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,906
Interesting question.

500
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,326
- Well, I mean, she's a very
beautiful girl, isn't she?

501
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:50,786
Mother.

502
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,747
- She took her father's
strong Brazilian blood,

503
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,043
his temper, and his mischief.

504
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,921
- 20 years later and she's still
bitter with Father.

505
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:03,173
- Well, some feelings just
don't wash away.

506
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,095
Are you enjoying the
Champagne grapes?

507
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:09,428
Simply delicious.

508
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,099
How did you two meet?

509
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:15,018
I ran into him this morning.

510
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,229
He was half-naked.

511
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,562
Really?

512
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:19,314
How embarrassing.

513
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,400
- Well, he was, I got him
out of the shower.

514
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:24,361
I thought he was working for Mr.
Wonderful.

515
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,029
- Oh, I think he's too
nice a young man

516
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:28,156
to be working for your ex-husband.

517
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,784
Jean-Jacques is another person

518
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:33,954
who doesn't wear off with time
in Mother's mind.

519
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:35,287
Nightmare.

520
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:38,708
Do you have bad dreams, Scott?

521
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:40,043
No, not usually.

522
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:42,295
Yeah, well, neither do it.

523
00:38:42,629 --> 00:38:44,673
Of course, I do see it
very much anyway.

524
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,843
So, you got Scott out of
the shower and-

525
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,345
- Let me make it smile for ya,
Mrs. Shawn.

526
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:53,515
Last night, Kimberly and I
slept together.

527
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:56,725
No.

528
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:01,313
No, you didn't.

529
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:12,784
- It's all right, Mother,
it's only birds.

530
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:18,832
Mother has this thing about birds.

531
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:26,088
Why do I get the feeling

532
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,549
that your mother was upset?

533
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:30,343
- Probably because you
underestimate her sense of humor,

534
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:32,220
which happens to be very dry.

535
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:33,554
She got the joke.

536
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:37,516
Do you like oldies?

537
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
Sometimes.

538
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:42,021
Why'd you go outwith me?

539
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,191
- Because I was alone and
feeling miserable.

540
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:45,650
The thought of having
lunch with Mother

541
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:46,985
just bored me to tears.

542
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,112
Plus, I had nothing better to do.

543
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:50,446
Ouch.

544
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:53,617
You're not gonna pout, are you?

545
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,076
How 'bout dinner?

546
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,410
You asked before.

547
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:57,578
Yeah, I know I already asked.

548
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:58,871
How 'bout dinner?

549
00:39:58,955 --> 00:39:59,955
Still no.

550
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:01,374
Somebody else?

551
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:04,920
Is it serious?

552
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:07,088
You ask too many questions.

553
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:09,591
- Yeah, well you don't
volunteer much information.

554
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:11,218
Drop me off over there.

555
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:12,551
What?

556
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:13,970
There, the black BMW.

557
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:25,941
What about your bike?

558
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:28,109
- Take care of it, I'll
pick it up later.

559
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:29,443
When?

560
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:30,277
Soon.

561
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:52,258
I don't know, man.

562
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:53,635
Whole things sounds pretty fishy.

563
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,012
- Well, how else do
you explain it?

564
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:57,346
I can't.

565
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:01,059
Very basic brain, beer damage.

566
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,939
But I do know things like this

567
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:07,983
just don't happen in real life.

568
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:09,901
Guy dreams of girl.

569
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:14,155
Guy sees picture of girl's face
on stolen t-shirt.

570
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:15,865
Guy tries to track girl down.

571
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,993
Girl finds guy.

572
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:19,326
Guy loses girl.

573
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,663
She left her bike.

574
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:25,292
- Big deal, a witch never leaves
her broomstick behind.

575
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:55,864
Nothing makes sense anymore,

576
00:41:57,073 --> 00:41:59,492
and you know what, I don't care.

577
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:38,447
It's open.

578
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,994
I knew you'd show up today.

579
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:47,499
After being so
mysterious and complex,

580
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,376
something started
making sense to me.

581
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,336
You're almost predictable.

582
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,134
I figured you out just by looking
closely at this bike.

583
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:03,682
Chrome, black,

584
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,015
power.

585
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:10,063
But not too much, enough to
drive you off a cliff.

586
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:14,067
Dangerous, yet sleek and
beautiful at the same time.

587
00:43:17,904 --> 00:43:20,115
Almost lost my head on a
bike like this once.

588
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:22,742
Spent five weeks in the hospital.

589
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:27,664
It was a stupid accident.

590
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,834
I think of it as my own Vietnam.

591
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:34,963
Idiotic, senseless.

592
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:39,384
But to me, it was heroic.

593
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,810
I always talk to people
about that accident

594
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:50,144
as if it was the only foolish

595
00:43:50,353 --> 00:43:52,272
and brave thing I've ever done.

596
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:53,605
First thing I said to myself

597
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,817
when I got out of
intensive care was,

598
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:58,361
god, I'd love to go for a ride.

599
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:00,655
False sense of freedom.

600
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:02,282
No seat belts, no helmets.

601
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:04,784
Just you, the machine, the wind.

602
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:08,246
And you go faster and faster,

603
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,416
and it gets riskier and riskier,
and it gives you a rush

604
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,127
like nothing else you've
seen in this world,

605
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:15,461
but you wouldn't stop doin' it

606
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:16,629
no matter how dangerous it got.

607
00:44:18,298 --> 00:44:20,133
- If therapy's over, I'll cook
dinner for you now.

608
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:21,467
Don't play games with me.

609
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:22,384
I'm not playing games.

610
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:23,720
I'm not a good loser.

611
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:25,472
- There's nothing to
win or lose here.

612
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,015
How 'bout my sanity?

613
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:30,769
You willing to take risks?

614
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,102
What do you think?

615
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:33,354
Then trust me.

616
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:46,386
The ride scare you?

617
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:50,181
- You always drive straight
to the bedroom?

618
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:52,433
- Only when I have to
pee real bad.

619
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,767
Be right back.

620
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:33,141
It's a pretty impressive house.

621
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,394
- Pretty boring too, it's being
sold for 12 million.

622
00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:37,812
You'll be rich.

623
00:46:38,146 --> 00:46:39,439
- No, I won't, I'm just
house sitting.

624
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:41,399
When the owner's sell,
I'm outta here.

625
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,610
Wanna play Bocuse?

626
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:48,031
I don't know the game.

627
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:51,117
- Bocuse, chef, South of France,
nouvelle cuisine.

628
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:54,495
- You got any pizza
in the freezer?

629
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,840
Wanna taste it?

630
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:17,935
Like it?

631
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:20,730
I love it, what is it?

632
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:23,483
Maybe it's the sauce.

633
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,570
Maybe it's just the way I taste.

634
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:33,326
- Well, I'm not real good with
puzzles, but let's find out.

635
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:11,698
You haven't touched your pizza.

636
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:14,283
You cook too well.

637
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:16,535
That's not all I do well.

638
00:48:16,703 --> 00:48:17,703
No?

639
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:21,207
Mm, I paint, and uh.

640
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:26,628
Mm.

641
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,549
I think food is sexy.

642
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:39,851
Like it?

643
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:41,686
- Now, that would make
great pizza topping.

644
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,189
- ls pizza all you
can think about?

645
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:47,775
- What about you,
what do you like?

646
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:52,864
- Hmm, carpaccio and um,
souffle Grand Marnier

647
00:48:54,657 --> 00:48:59,537
and uh, veal cooked with
grapes and coq au vin.

648
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:01,539
Coq au vin.

649
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:05,917
Uh-huh.

650
00:49:07,587 --> 00:49:11,049
- What exotic dishes are we
eating right now?

651
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:13,008
Salad.

652
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:15,762
Salad?

653
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:17,095
Mm-hmm.

654
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:18,598
Plain ordinary salad.

655
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:19,931
Mm-hmm.

656
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:21,641
Bummer.

657
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,399
I have a confession to make.

658
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:13,486
What?

659
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,614
- I can't take you back,
I'm too tired.

660
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:19,826
Is this a come-on, Kimberly?

661
00:50:24,872 --> 00:50:26,999
- You had a good time with me
today, didn't you?

662
00:50:28,835 --> 00:50:29,835
Yeah.

663
00:50:30,545 --> 00:50:31,545
I really did.

664
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,550
- I'm starting to like you, Scott,
a lot,

665
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:38,094
and I really love foreplay.

666
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:40,221
Is there any reason we
have to rush this?

667
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,558
Not that I can think of.

668
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:45,101
Good, I'll sleep in my bedroom.

669
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:46,602
The rest of the place is yours.

670
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:49,646
I'll clean up.

671
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,482
Leave it for the maid.

672
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:53,067
When does she come?

673
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:54,401
Next week.

674
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:01,654
What took you so long?

675
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:03,781
- I thought you didn't
wanna rush things?

676
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:06,032
I lied.

677
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,584
What, what is it?

678
00:59:50,479 --> 00:59:52,773
So, what was that all
about last night?

679
00:59:53,107 --> 00:59:54,191
Love.

680
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:57,027
- Come on, Scott, I'm talking
about your sudden urge

681
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:59,321
to kiss me while I was
sleeping so nicely.

682
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:02,324
That's all it was, an urge.

683
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:05,911
I'd rather hear the truth.

684
01:00:07,788 --> 01:00:09,915
- Truth is I had a strange
dream last night.

685
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:15,921
Some guy with a shotgun came into
your room and blasted you.

686
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,047
Did bleed?

687
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:18,965
A lot.

688
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:21,927
- Good, that means
strong emotions.

689
01:00:22,261 --> 01:00:23,679
Was it day or night?

690
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:25,222
Does it matter?

691
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:26,557
Sure.

692
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:31,186
Strong emotions, quiet
subconscious, violence,

693
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,231
an unknown man in the dark,
threat.

694
01:00:36,692 --> 01:00:38,277
Was he French, by any chance?

695
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:40,361
He didn't speak.

696
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,282
Well, I'm no dream expert,

697
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:47,286
but I bet all of those
Jean-Jacques horror stories

698
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:48,787
affected you real bad.

699
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:52,207
I never had bad dreams before.

700
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,169
That makes you abnormal.

701
01:00:55,502 --> 01:00:57,588
I've had horrible dreams
until I was 16.

702
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:00,841
Then what happened?

703
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:02,551
I made love for the first time.

704
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:33,373
Come on, come on.

705
01:01:33,707 --> 01:01:35,292
Come on, what are you waiting for?

706
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,150
That wasn't funny.

707
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:03,195
- You just have a rotten
sense of humor.

708
01:02:03,529 --> 01:02:04,780
Oh yeah.

709
01:02:05,113 --> 01:02:06,323
What's wrong with it?

710
01:02:06,657 --> 01:02:08,492
It's got a mind of its own.

711
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:11,036
When it's convenient for you
to laugh, it works.

712
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,330
When it's not convenient,
nothing's funny.

713
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,916
Very impressive, Doctor.

714
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,376
We've known each other
for 24 hours,

715
01:02:17,709 --> 01:02:19,086
you've already analyzed my dreams

716
01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:20,754
and criticized my sense of humor.

717
01:02:22,089 --> 01:02:24,091
- I wouldn't change you
for anything.

718
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:40,357
You wanna know somethin'?

719
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,694
Okay, here it goes.

720
01:02:46,613 --> 01:02:47,613
What I'm about to tell you

721
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:49,199
is one hell of an important thing.

722
01:02:50,993 --> 01:02:54,288
It's not conjecture, it's
not a promise,

723
01:02:54,621 --> 01:02:59,084
it's just what is right now,
today, at this moment, okay?

724
01:03:04,673 --> 01:03:05,673
Thing is I love you.

725
01:03:12,264 --> 01:03:13,473
What did I say?

726
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Kimberly!

727
01:03:33,118 --> 01:03:35,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait.

728
01:03:35,454 --> 01:03:36,538
What's wrong?

729
01:03:36,872 --> 01:03:40,042
- There's no way you can love
someone in such a short time.

730
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:42,753
Okay, wrong choice of words.

731
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,464
How 'bout this, I think I'm
falling in love with you.

732
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:47,673
No, you're not.

733
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:48,591
Yes, I am.

734
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:49,508
How do you know?

735
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:50,385
I know me.

736
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:52,638
- Look, we're two
consenting adults

737
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:54,514
having some fun, that's all.

738
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:58,935
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

739
01:03:59,019 --> 01:04:00,270
I withdraw everything I said.

740
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:01,604
From now on, I'll just
keep my mouth shut

741
01:04:01,813 --> 01:04:02,940
and my feelings to myself.

742
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:34,804
Hello.

743
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,770
Fine.

744
01:04:43,772 --> 01:04:44,772
I'll call you later.

745
01:04:49,111 --> 01:04:51,738
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna ask
you any more questions.

746
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,449
It'll be better that way.

747
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,590
# Love

748
01:05:10,924 --> 01:05:15,679
# ls a many splendored thing

749
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:21,059
# It's the April rose

750
01:05:21,393 --> 01:05:24,062
# That only grows

751
01:05:24,396 --> 01:05:28,567
# In the early spring

752
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,900
# Love

753
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:30,943
Tired?

754
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:32,529
# ls nature's way

755
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:33,863
Why?

756
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:37,242
- You almost fell
asleep in my arms.

757
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:39,244
Just had my eyes closed.

758
01:05:40,954 --> 01:05:42,330
I see better that way.

759
01:05:42,664 --> 01:05:44,416
# The golden crown

760
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,043
What were you seeing just now?

761
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:53,425
- Us in St. Thomas or Rio, far
away from all this.

762
01:05:54,634 --> 01:05:56,178
# Love

763
01:05:56,511 --> 01:05:58,138
Well, this isn't too shabby,
you know?

764
01:05:59,806 --> 01:06:02,267
- Yes, but the residue of
my life is here.

765
01:06:04,352 --> 01:06:05,352
All I've ever done,

766
01:06:07,606 --> 01:06:09,357
all I still have to do.

767
01:06:11,193 --> 01:06:13,612
I like everything to be brand new,

768
01:06:13,945 --> 01:06:17,115
without a past, just for you.

769
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:18,992
- Hey, I thought we
weren't gonna talk

770
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,536
about the past or the future.

771
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,914
# My silent heart

772
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:25,247
# And taught it how to sing

773
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:26,500
You can always talk.

774
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,668
Just don't scare me with feelings.

775
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:30,753
I can't handle those.

776
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:36,218
# True love's a many
splendored thing

777
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:05,955
Scott.

778
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:09,875
Scott!

779
01:07:13,588 --> 01:07:15,132
What are you doing?

780
01:07:20,512 --> 01:07:21,512
Scott, stop!

781
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:24,306
Stop!

782
01:08:23,116 --> 01:08:24,826
Wanna talk about it?

783
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:26,912
Not right now.

784
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:30,707
- Come on, Scott, what's
going on here?

785
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:33,501
What's really bothering you'?

786
01:08:33,835 --> 01:08:34,836
Talk to me, damn it.

787
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:38,840
- I've just had a couple of bad
dreams lately, that's all.

788
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:41,301
- We've all had our share
of nightmares.

789
01:08:41,635 --> 01:08:42,761
Don't let it get you down.

790
01:08:43,929 --> 01:08:45,305
Yeah, I'll be okay.

791
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,140
I know you will.

792
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,648
- I'm gonna sleep out
here tonight.

793
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:56,149
I don't wanna scare ya anymore.

794
01:08:57,525 --> 01:08:59,319
- Sleep with me, it
won't happen again.

795
01:08:59,653 --> 01:09:00,653
It's all over.

796
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:05,075
I'm gonna sleep in the tent.

797
01:10:18,273 --> 01:10:19,273
Kimberly?

798
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,321
Kim?

799
01:10:28,742 --> 01:10:29,742
Kimberly?

800
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,165
Kimberly!

801
01:10:35,498 --> 01:10:37,208
You look like you saw a ghost.

802
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:39,294
- God, you scared the
hell outta me.

803
01:10:39,627 --> 01:10:41,921
- Yeah, I look horrible
in the morning.

804
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:45,884
- I thought you, I
thought you'd left.

805
01:10:46,217 --> 01:10:47,635
Just about to, why?

806
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:50,472
I made you some breakfast.

807
01:10:50,805 --> 01:10:52,223
- You can use some food,
I gotta run.

808
01:10:52,557 --> 01:10:53,767
Wait, what's the hurry?

809
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,436
The house may be for free,

810
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,480
but nobody pays for my expenses.

811
01:10:58,813 --> 01:10:59,813
I gotta work sometime.

812
01:11:01,149 --> 01:11:02,901
All right, give me a lift.

813
01:11:03,234 --> 01:11:04,234
I'll just be a minute.

814
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:39,396
- I'm having a few friends over
for dinner tonight.

815
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,189
Can you make it by seven?

816
01:11:41,523 --> 01:11:42,523
I'll be there.

817
01:11:42,723 --> 01:11:43,315
Great.

818
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:55,995
Follow her, not too close.

819
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,546
A few friends for dinner, huh?

820
01:13:29,589 --> 01:13:31,090
I hate dull meals.

821
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:35,303
- Does the owner know you're
throwing these little bashes?

822
01:13:35,637 --> 01:13:36,888
He couldn't care less.

823
01:13:37,222 --> 01:13:38,973
He's so bored and unhappy with
all of his money,

824
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:40,308
he probably wouldn't get upset

825
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:41,726
if the place burned to the ground.

826
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,436
Hi, Ken! - I root for the guy.

827
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,358
Someone you know?

828
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,026
Yeah, a friend.

829
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,402
You don't know here?

830
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:55,031
- I don't know everybody who
comes to my parties.

831
01:13:58,326 --> 01:14:01,496
- Well, well, my god,
it's a small world.

832
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:04,207
Hi, Lena, this is Kimberly.

833
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,084
Hi, great place you've got.

834
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:07,460
Thank you.

835
01:14:07,794 --> 01:14:10,338
- If you don't mind my saying so,
you're beautiful.

836
01:14:10,672 --> 01:14:12,924
Thanks again, it's the makeup.

837
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:14,258
Scott, I've got to mingle.

838
01:14:14,342 --> 01:14:15,885
Why don't you keep Lena company?

839
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:17,219
Excuse me.

840
01:14:20,306 --> 01:14:21,849
Ooh.

841
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:23,183
She invite you?

842
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:24,644
Oh, not personally.

843
01:14:24,978 --> 01:14:27,105
Kind of a friend of a
friend of a friend.

844
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:30,733
You know how parties are.

845
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:32,068
- Any chance you're
remembering the name

846
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:33,945
of this mysterious friend?

847
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:37,115
- Well, let's see, I've
had three drinks.

848
01:14:38,616 --> 01:14:40,034
Give me another half hour,

849
01:14:40,368 --> 01:14:42,954
I can come up with all the names
you want.

850
01:14:44,872 --> 01:14:46,249
She your new flame?

851
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,002
- Well, I'm afraid it's gone
way beyond that.

852
01:14:49,335 --> 01:14:50,503
Ooh.

853
01:14:50,837 --> 01:14:54,424
I hate to admit it, but you make a
great-looking couple.

854
01:14:57,385 --> 01:14:58,803
- Hey Lena, you're a hell of a
girl, you know that?

855
01:15:02,724 --> 01:15:03,724
Hmm.

856
01:15:04,684 --> 01:15:06,185
Oh, don't worry, Scott,
I don't talk.

857
01:15:23,828 --> 01:15:25,413
- Why don't you let me
help you to bed?

858
01:15:25,747 --> 01:15:26,747
" Bed?

859
01:15:27,332 --> 01:15:29,917
Hell no, party's just heatin' up.

860
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:32,420
- Come on, Scott, you need a
good night's sleep.

861
01:15:32,754 --> 01:15:34,213
Right.

862
01:15:34,547 --> 01:15:36,924
Like all the other good night's
sleep I've had lately.

863
01:15:39,427 --> 01:15:40,427
Hey.

864
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:44,515
Please, Scott, I bruise easily.

865
01:15:44,849 --> 01:15:49,145
- Bruise easy, get off your
princess cloud, Kim.

866
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:50,813
I'm trying to spill my guts here.

867
01:16:07,413 --> 01:16:10,208
I've told you some lies, my love.

868
01:16:12,877 --> 01:16:16,005
The first time I saw your face, it
wasn't on any t-shirt.

869
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:20,843
It was in a nightmare.

870
01:16:22,136 --> 01:16:23,888
I was trying to
strangle you to death.

871
01:16:29,143 --> 01:16:30,143
And, uh,

872
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:37,276
when I told you you had an
interesting face, another lie.

873
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:43,324
Your face is not interesting, Kim.

874
01:16:45,284 --> 01:16:48,162
It's the most beautiful thing I've
ever seen in my life.

875
01:16:48,496 --> 01:16:49,496
Shh.

876
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:50,539
I can't-

877
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,331
Stop this.

878
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:52,750
- If I do, I might not
have the guts

879
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:54,752
to finish what I have to say.

880
01:16:55,086 --> 01:16:57,255
- Then don't finish, I don't
want to hear it.

881
01:16:57,588 --> 01:16:58,881
You've gotta hear it.

882
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:00,215
Why?

883
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:05,346
- Because I dream every night
that I'm killing you.

884
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:14,230
In the beginning, it was
just a nightmare,

885
01:17:16,107 --> 01:17:17,692
but can't you see it?

886
01:17:19,318 --> 01:17:23,406
It's come true, I mean, I'm here
in the same house,

887
01:17:24,866 --> 01:17:26,200
scared I'm gonna hurt you.

888
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:29,912
Christ, I can't even protect
you from myself.

889
01:17:31,456 --> 01:17:32,832
But because I love you so much

890
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:34,542
and because I'm such a
fucking coward,

891
01:17:34,876 --> 01:17:37,962
I can't just walk away,
never see you again.

892
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,147
You've got some secrets too.

893
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,318
Black BMW, house in the Hills.

894
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,326
And I got a feelin' you're
more scared than me.

895
01:18:10,369 --> 01:18:11,954
What are your nightmares,
Kimberly?

896
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:16,834
- Well, I need to tell
you that I love

897
01:18:17,168 --> 01:18:18,920
but being terrified to say it,

898
01:18:20,546 --> 01:18:24,217
losing you when I want you more
than anything in this world,

899
01:18:26,052 --> 01:18:27,428
pretending not to be jealous

900
01:18:27,762 --> 01:18:29,347
when I see you with another woman.

901
01:18:31,557 --> 01:18:33,100
I have lots of nightmares, Scott.

902
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,313
You don't want to know about them

903
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,024
because you're a part of
them and it hurts.

904
01:19:03,422 --> 01:19:05,383
- I was looking for an
aspirin yesterday,

905
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:08,344
and I found this in one
of your drawers.

906
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:12,014
I live alone here, I have to.

907
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:13,348
I know.

908
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:16,394
I want you to do me a favor.

909
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:19,939
Put it under your pillow,

910
01:19:22,108 --> 01:19:25,403
and if I ever try to
hurt you again,

911
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:30,031
you shoot me.

912
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,710
Good morning.

913
01:21:06,504 --> 01:21:07,630
What year is this?

914
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:09,674
Same year, new day.

915
01:21:10,007 --> 01:21:11,092
You slept like a log.

916
01:21:20,768 --> 01:21:21,768
Here.

917
01:21:22,353 --> 01:21:23,396
Hangover medicine.

918
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:36,409
Ugh, juice from hell.

919
01:21:36,742 --> 01:21:37,827
It'll make you feel better.

920
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:43,582
And try to get some more sleep.

921
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:45,209
Yeah, very funny.

922
01:21:45,543 --> 01:21:48,337
With this black poison in me, I'll
be awake till I'm 40.

923
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:49,714
Where you goin'?

924
01:21:50,047 --> 01:21:51,047
Work.

925
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:53,509
Oh, new mysteries.

926
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:55,511
No more mysteries.

927
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:57,680
Here's my number, call me
if you need me.

928
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:01,183
- What the hell am I
supposed to do

929
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,310
all alone in this mortuary?

930
01:22:03,644 --> 01:22:07,148
- Snoop around, watch some movies,
get well.

931
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,360
See ya later.

932
01:23:03,037 --> 01:23:06,540
# There's a cold wind blowin'
in the night

933
01:23:06,874 --> 01:23:11,504
# I see your face but you're
no where in sight

934
01:23:11,837 --> 01:23:14,590
# I wanna touch you in the
heat of the light

935
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:17,134
# You're a cold wind blowin'

936
01:23:17,468 --> 01:23:22,223
# Cold wind blowin' in the night

937
01:23:22,723 --> 01:23:24,475
<i>I Ah</i>

938
01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:26,977
- Oh, yeah, hi, um, I
was wondering,

939
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:30,314
how much would it be to have
one of your planes

940
01:23:30,648 --> 01:23:31,816
fly a personalized banner.

941
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:34,568
# There's no place you can hide

942
01:23:34,902 --> 01:23:38,989
- Um, it's Pacific Coast
Highway near Malibu.

943
01:23:39,323 --> 01:23:40,323
# I'll go searchin'
for the answers

944
01:23:40,574 --> 01:23:41,617
- Aw, I don't know, somethin'
shod,

945
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:45,037
like, I love you, Kimberly,
something like that.

946
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:48,456
Really?

947
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:51,669
# Cold wind

948
01:23:52,002 --> 01:23:55,548
# Cold wind

949
01:23:55,881 --> 01:23:57,800
# Cold wind

950
01:24:19,405 --> 01:24:20,405
You can't do this to me.

951
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:22,449
Wonder what Fatty is up to.

952
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:23,951
Idiot.

953
01:24:24,285 --> 01:24:25,703
A zero, an incompetent.

954
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:30,583
- You don't understand, I got
no place left to go.

955
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:33,294
Get out of here!

956
01:24:33,627 --> 01:24:35,296
- It's like you're killing me,
old man!

957
01:24:37,214 --> 01:24:40,050
- Get out before I
call the police.

958
01:24:42,469 --> 01:24:43,846
You crazy bastard.

959
01:24:45,472 --> 01:24:46,557
He hit hard.

960
01:25:06,118 --> 01:25:07,244
- I
asked you first.

961
01:25:07,578 --> 01:25:09,496
- Yeah,
but I got the gun.

962
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,915
Yeah, I'll rephrase that.

963
01:25:11,248 --> 01:25:13,792
Yeah, who the hell are you and
why do you have a gun?

964
01:25:14,126 --> 01:25:15,126
I'm the owner.

965
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:16,337
Bullshit, you're Mexican.

966
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:18,172
I hate stereotypes.

967
01:25:18,505 --> 01:25:21,800
- Go ahead,
make, what's that line, T.C.?

968
01:25:22,134 --> 01:25:23,134
Day.

969
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:25,221
Yeah.

970
01:27:04,028 --> 01:27:05,195
Stroman Associates.

971
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:07,781
Uh yeah, Kimberly Shawn, please.

972
01:27:08,115 --> 01:27:09,825
- I'm sorry, Miss
Shawn outwith a client.

973
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,535
Can I take a message?

974
01:27:11,869 --> 01:27:14,246
- I'm supposed to deliver
some shoes to her.

975
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,206
Could you give me her address?

976
01:27:32,765 --> 01:27:34,266
- Stroman
Associates, can I help you?

977
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,769
Uh, yeah, Kimberly Shawn please.

978
01:27:37,102 --> 01:27:38,645
- I'm sorry,
she's still out.

979
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:39,980
Would you like to leave a message?

980
01:27:40,314 --> 01:27:42,941
- Oh no, no message, I
called before, thanks.

981
01:27:57,498 --> 01:27:58,791
Stroman Associates.

982
01:27:59,124 --> 01:28:01,335
- Yeah, is Kimberly
Shawn back yet?

983
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:03,712
- I'm sorry,
she's not.

984
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:06,340
Maybe she's gone for the day.

985
01:28:06,673 --> 01:28:07,716
Okay, thanks.

986
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:29,321
Kimberly Shawn, what a
pleasant surprise.

987
01:28:29,655 --> 01:28:31,740
Scott, this is Karen, my-

988
01:28:32,074 --> 01:28:33,283
- Oh, nice to meet you, but I'm
really in a hurry.

989
01:28:33,617 --> 01:28:34,617
Can we please talk?

990
01:28:35,953 --> 01:28:37,663
Come with me or I'll
break your arm.

991
01:28:37,996 --> 01:28:39,665
I'm fine, I'll see you upstairs.

992
01:28:53,053 --> 01:28:54,847
Just the what the hell do you
think you're doing?

993
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,807
- Oh, don't mind me, Miss Shawn,
I'm just kidnapping you.

994
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:58,976
I need some answers and I need
'em fuckin' quick!

995
01:28:59,309 --> 01:29:00,310
Answers to what?

996
01:29:00,644 --> 01:29:01,644
You keep actin' stupid,

997
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:04,106
I'm gonna kick the shit
outta you right here.

998
01:29:20,038 --> 01:29:23,083
Here we are, Lovers' Lane.

999
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:26,420
All's quiet, nobody can hear you.

1000
01:29:26,753 --> 01:29:27,963
Please, talk.

1001
01:29:28,297 --> 01:29:30,966
You're crazy, totally insane.

1002
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,470
- No, not quite yet, pretty close,
but not quite yet.

1003
01:29:35,929 --> 01:29:36,929
Ta-da!

1004
01:29:37,222 --> 01:29:39,183
New in your
neighborhood video store,

1005
01:29:39,516 --> 01:29:41,643
Nightmare in Scott's Mind.

1006
01:29:41,977 --> 01:29:43,395
Why are you telling me this?

1007
01:29:43,729 --> 01:29:48,233
- Because, dear one, this disc has
my nightmare on it.

1008
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:49,860
No, let me rephrase that.

1009
01:29:50,194 --> 01:29:54,698
This disc is my nightmare, frame
by stinking frame.

1010
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:58,035
And guess where I found it,
in your house,

1011
01:29:58,368 --> 01:29:59,368
in your screening room.

1012
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:01,497
Now, ain't that a coincidence?

1013
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:02,873
No, it's not.

1014
01:30:03,207 --> 01:30:06,084
I took it out of the vault and
put it there myself.

1015
01:30:07,878 --> 01:30:10,631
- This is some kind of game,
isn't it?

1016
01:30:13,342 --> 01:30:17,721
Some sick mind fuck, and
you're part of it.

1017
01:30:25,395 --> 01:30:28,524
- If I ever try to hurt you again,
shoot me.

1018
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:38,242
It's not a game, it's
an experiment,

1019
01:30:38,575 --> 01:30:42,079
and we're both part of it,
but it went too far.

1020
01:30:42,412 --> 01:30:46,500
I had to stop it, for your sake,
for mine.

1021
01:30:48,669 --> 01:30:50,837
- Well, it's nice to know
I'm not goin' nuts.

1022
01:30:53,674 --> 01:30:56,051
Now, I'd like to know
who's behind it.

1023
01:30:56,385 --> 01:30:58,136
- You should be talking
to Ken Strom.

1024
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,596
I intend to.

1025
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,930
Where do I find him?

1026
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:02,849
- You'll never make it alone,
you need me.

1027
01:31:03,183 --> 01:31:04,560
Like a hole in the head.

1028
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:05,978
Use me as a hostage.

1029
01:31:06,311 --> 01:31:08,772
Ken won't touch you as long as he
thinks I'm in danger.

1030
01:31:09,106 --> 01:31:10,106
Why should he care?

1031
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:15,278
He's my lover.

1032
01:31:22,953 --> 01:31:25,998
- Ken, old boy, this is
your pal, Scott Bruin.

1033
01:31:26,331 --> 01:31:28,834
Listen, asshole, I got your
girlfriend right here,

1034
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:31,336
and I got a gun pointed on
her pretty head.

1035
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,005
She and I are gonna pay
a visit soon,

1036
01:31:33,338 --> 01:31:35,048
clear some old bills, you
know what I mean?

1037
01:31:36,675 --> 01:31:39,011
Yes, sir, they'll be expected.

1038
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:47,310
" Yes.

1039
01:31:49,396 --> 01:31:50,396
No, let them through.

1040
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:54,067
Make sure your men stay
out of their way.

1041
01:31:56,987 --> 01:31:57,987
Yes, I'll be fine.

1042
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:29,895
Good evening, Ken.

1043
01:32:31,188 --> 01:32:32,189
Oh, don't get up.

1044
01:32:32,522 --> 01:32:33,522
We're all family here,

1045
01:32:33,815 --> 01:32:35,233
no need to get hung up
on formalities.

1046
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:40,322
You won't use that.

1047
01:32:41,323 --> 01:32:43,158
No, I won't.

1048
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:51,083
But my finger has a
mind of its own.

1049
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:52,626
What do you want?

1050
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:56,296
- Even trade, your
girlfriend for my sanity.

1051
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:57,630
Let her go.

1052
01:32:58,423 --> 01:33:00,217
Then you can have what you want.

1053
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:01,550
Including your life?

1054
01:33:02,803 --> 01:33:07,265
Remember Ken, I'm out of control,
a homicidal lunatic.

1055
01:33:08,975 --> 01:33:10,102
I'm your product, Ken, and I'll
bet you're real proud

1056
01:33:10,435 --> 01:33:11,435
of what I've become.

1057
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:17,192
But tell me something, right now,
deep down inside,

1058
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:19,568
aren't you just a
little bit scared?

1059
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:24,032
- I'm gonna let you in on a
little secret, friend.

1060
01:33:25,534 --> 01:33:27,577
You're involved in a
rather unethical,

1061
01:33:27,911 --> 01:33:32,332
yet crucial experiment, broad
beyond any imagination,

1062
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:36,253
one that will alter the
face of the world.

1063
01:33:36,586 --> 01:33:41,341
True, we did use you in a very
cruel and inhuman manner,

1064
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,177
but there was no other way.

1065
01:33:44,511 --> 01:33:47,180
- I just love a man who's
ridden by guilt.

1066
01:33:48,306 --> 01:33:49,433
Why me?

1067
01:33:49,766 --> 01:33:52,144
- Because of all the good
things you are.

1068
01:33:52,477 --> 01:33:55,856
Your psychological profile,
perfect.

1069
01:33:56,189 --> 01:33:58,108
No emotional attachments.

1070
01:33:58,442 --> 01:34:02,070
And an accident, you stayed five
weeks in intensive care.

1071
01:34:03,488 --> 01:34:06,867
We obtained access to your brain,
CAT scans, EEGs,

1072
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,494
every chart and bit of
information available,

1073
01:34:09,828 --> 01:34:11,288
including the rather tempting fact

1074
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:14,374
that you had four broken teeth
that need replacement.

1075
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:16,877
The ideal guinea pig.

1076
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:20,297
You are the first recipient of
a micro receiver,

1077
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:22,966
small enough to be
implanted in a tooth,

1078
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,052
yet potent enough to receive
directly through your brain

1079
01:34:26,386 --> 01:34:31,141
high-frequency, high-definition
television transmissions.

1080
01:34:54,831 --> 01:34:55,831
See?

1081
01:34:56,031 --> 01:34:57,000
No more hallucinations.

1082
01:34:57,334 --> 01:34:58,919
You trust me, I trust you.

1083
01:35:00,754 --> 01:35:04,966
True, we did some things that
might seem ethically wrong,

1084
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,385
but it's worth a lot of money,

1085
01:35:07,719 --> 01:35:09,679
and we had a colossal
Japanese investment

1086
01:35:10,013 --> 01:35:12,641
fall right into our laps with
proof that it works.

1087
01:35:14,392 --> 01:35:16,603
Mind-altering technology
has been the dream

1088
01:35:16,937 --> 01:35:19,898
of many principled people, let
alone governments.

1089
01:35:20,232 --> 01:35:22,692
Sometimes we must sacrifice
our own emotions

1090
01:35:23,026 --> 01:35:24,653
to the life of the venture.

1091
01:35:24,986 --> 01:35:26,655
I paid a high price myself.

1092
01:35:26,988 --> 01:35:28,532
Kimberly is precious to me.

1093
01:35:28,865 --> 01:35:30,325
Me too.

1094
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:31,659
She's a great lay.

1095
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:37,958
- I assume by now that
you've figured out

1096
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:39,376
the rest of the story.

1097
01:35:40,836 --> 01:35:44,548
The guy on the bicycle, Dr.
Frieberg, Rudy, Mrs. Shawn.

1098
01:35:45,549 --> 01:35:46,883
They all work for us.

1099
01:35:48,552 --> 01:35:51,638
And all the other minor
characters, and the props,

1100
01:35:51,972 --> 01:35:53,306
like the mysterious black BMW

1101
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,809
and the rented house in Malibu.

1102
01:35:56,142 --> 01:35:57,769
Now that you understand the scale

1103
01:35:58,103 --> 01:35:59,604
and the importance of
this project,

1104
01:35:59,938 --> 01:36:02,232
take ordinary people,
make them killers,

1105
01:36:02,566 --> 01:36:05,735
take those born violent,
make them good.

1106
01:36:06,069 --> 01:36:08,405
Now that you understand the
meaning of real power,

1107
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:11,241
let me suggest your options.

1108
01:36:11,575 --> 01:36:13,869
Worst case scenario, you shoot me.

1109
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:18,039
My men storm the room, they
shoot you, and Kimberly.

1110
01:36:19,499 --> 01:36:22,294
Best case scenario, you get
back your discs,

1111
01:36:22,627 --> 01:36:24,880
we give you a decent check
for your troubles,

1112
01:36:25,213 --> 01:36:27,215
and we put this thing to bed.

1113
01:36:27,549 --> 01:36:31,011
- You're so intelligent
and eloquent, Ken.

1114
01:36:32,679 --> 01:36:34,723
How could anyone resist such a
rational approach?

1115
01:36:36,057 --> 01:36:37,309
I'll tell ya what,

1116
01:36:37,642 --> 01:36:40,020
let me give you my best
case/worst case scenario

1117
01:36:40,353 --> 01:36:41,646
and see where that takes us.

1118
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:45,275
Best case scenario, I walk outta
here with Kimberly.

1119
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:46,776
I get to keep her.

1120
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:48,361
I go public.

1121
01:36:48,695 --> 01:36:49,695
You go through some heavy shit
with some lawyers

1122
01:36:49,821 --> 01:36:51,406
and spend a few years in the pen.

1123
01:36:52,741 --> 01:36:55,577
Worst case scenario, I shoot
Kimberly, I shoot you,

1124
01:36:55,911 --> 01:36:57,203
boom, it's a wrap.

1125
01:36:57,537 --> 01:36:58,538
You wouldn't kill her.

1126
01:36:58,872 --> 01:37:00,206
I will Ken.

1127
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,043
It's like you said, sometimes
we have sacrifice

1128
01:37:03,376 --> 01:37:05,879
our own emotions for the
sake of the venture,

1129
01:37:06,212 --> 01:37:09,090
and if I can't have her, I really
don't care if she's dead.

1130
01:37:10,675 --> 01:37:12,594
Well, it's been nice socializing,

1131
01:37:12,928 --> 01:37:14,930
but I got a dentist appointment.

1132
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:17,349
You tell your goons they
make one wrong move

1133
01:37:17,682 --> 01:37:19,142
and no more Kimberly.

1134
01:37:19,476 --> 01:37:22,854
Oh, and Ken, I'm not the
crazy one here.

1135
01:37:23,188 --> 01:37:25,732
It's you, you are the
sickest motherfucker

1136
01:37:26,066 --> 01:37:28,193
I've ever met in my life.

1137
01:37:28,526 --> 01:37:33,281
- Wherever you go, I'll be there,
and Kimberly, be careful.

1138
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:37,619
Remember, I love you very much.

1139
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:39,329
Don't forget that.

1140
01:37:50,215 --> 01:37:52,717
Don't lose them, get
the van ready.

1141
01:37:58,556 --> 01:38:00,475
You really do love him, don't you,
Kimberly.

1142
01:38:05,522 --> 01:38:09,526
I want you to stay close,
make it look clean.

1143
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:12,653
If you have to,

1144
01:38:14,739 --> 01:38:15,739
sacrifice the girl.

1145
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:08,625
It's them.

1146
01:39:09,461 --> 01:39:10,462
Hang on.

1147
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:46,891
Come on, come on.

1148
01:40:53,898 --> 01:40:55,733
Oh my god.

1149
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:01,716
Okay, okay.

1150
01:42:32,205 --> 01:42:34,165
It's okay, it's all over.

1151
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,750
It'll never be over.

1152
01:42:36,876 --> 01:42:38,795
He'll come after us.

1153
01:42:39,128 --> 01:42:40,755
He always gets what he wants.

1154
01:42:41,089 --> 01:42:43,633
- Maybe not this time, not
if we're smart.

1155
01:42:43,967 --> 01:42:45,677
What else is keeping
in that vault?

1156
01:42:47,345 --> 01:42:50,723
- All the original tapes
of the project,

1157
01:42:51,057 --> 01:42:54,769
all the files, names, canceled
checks, everything.

1158
01:42:55,103 --> 01:42:56,103
That's our insurance.

1159
01:42:57,063 --> 01:42:58,690
We can't go back to the house.

1160
01:42:59,023 --> 01:43:00,608
They're probably waiting.

1161
01:43:00,942 --> 01:43:03,444
I don't make good
collateral anymore.

1162
01:43:03,778 --> 01:43:08,533
Let's gamble.

1163
01:43:30,763 --> 01:43:31,764
How many cameras in the house?

1164
01:43:32,098 --> 01:43:34,100
About five or six, I think.

1165
01:43:34,434 --> 01:43:36,311
Then they'll know soon.

1166
01:44:43,503 --> 01:44:44,503
Shh.

1167
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:47,130
Over there.

1168
01:45:05,149 --> 01:45:06,317
What are you doing?

1169
01:45:06,651 --> 01:45:08,403
I've got more bullets.

1170
01:46:22,894 --> 01:46:23,894
Why?

1171
01:46:24,604 --> 01:46:26,355
Because it had to be like this,

1172
01:46:26,689 --> 01:46:29,358
because sooner or later, he'd
claim what's his.

1173
01:46:29,692 --> 01:46:31,319
You and I would never
have any peace,

1174
01:46:31,652 --> 01:46:33,988
no matter how far we ran
or where we hid.

1175
01:46:35,573 --> 01:46:38,326
Because I am a bad dream,
and I betrayed you,

1176
01:46:39,869 --> 01:46:41,245
and you would never forget that.

1177
01:46:42,663 --> 01:46:45,333
Because he promised that this
way you'd be safe.

1178
01:46:46,876 --> 01:46:49,086
Because.

1179
01:46:56,177 --> 01:46:57,177
Take good care of her.

1180
01:46:59,138 --> 01:47:00,473
I love you, Kim.

1181
01:47:02,141 --> 01:47:05,728
- We always love what we don't
have or can't have.

1182
01:47:07,855 --> 01:47:09,023
Goodbye, my love.
