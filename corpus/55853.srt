00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,555
It's Connie,
she's run away again!

3
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,468
She's onIy 15.

4
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,111
How does my daughter faII
for this sIime baII?

5
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,476
Do you know him?

6
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,114
Yeah, I met him once.
His name is Zip.

7
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,319
That's a great name, huh?

8
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,514
Jack, you're a cop.

9
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,314
Grand theft auto.
You want missing persons.

10
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,832
You know where he Iives?

11
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,231
Something Iike Trump Street,
or Trout Street or....

12
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,233
- Turk? Turk Street?
- Yes, Turk Street. Turk Street.

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,435

They've got a Iist a miIe Iong.

15
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,231
By the time they get to her, she'II

She'II be back.

- Amy, I'm....

19
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,794
You're going on vacation,

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,677
A week with you and your ceIIo.

21

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,830
That'II be so different for you.

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,716
I know I'm just your neighbor.
I had no business asking.

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,632
You have a great time, okay?

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,636
I was pIanning on bIacking him out.
I'm gIad I didn't.

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,158
It can't be that different
from Iooking for a car, right?

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,430
Turk Street.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,192
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, you okay?

68
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,154
Oh! You mustn't bother.

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,879
It's no bother.
Just get out of the rain. Come on.

70
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,196
So you don't Iive
in the neighborhood.

71
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,992
No, I'm Iooking for someone.

72
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,912
You can just
set them down there.

73
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,877
No, no.
I'II take them in the kitchen.

74
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,718
WeII, this way.

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,795
Thomas, we have a visitor!

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,471
Don't be aIarmed,
we have a stranger in the house.

77
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,712
- Thomas, dear. This is....
- Jack. Jack Friar.

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,038
This is Mr. Quarre,
I'm Mrs. Quarre.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,475
Who is it you're Iooking for,
Jack, a friend?

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,188
No, a suspect.
WeII, not a suspect reaIIy.

81
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,790
A young man.

82
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,599
You're a poIiceman.

83
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,748
- I reaIIy shouId be going.
- Oh, dear, don't go.

84
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,871
I'II put on some water for tea.

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,670
- Thanks but I have to....
- We won't hear of you Ieaving.

86
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,959
I must thank you for your kindness.
Now, it's Indian tea.

87
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,514
India Indians. Not the ones
we beat the crap out of.

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,793
No, I reaIIy must go.

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,871
This one's made
from hard wood... Oak, mahogany.

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,749
I've got one made in Africa
from ivory.

91
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,635
Maybe one of your cousins
carved it, huh?

92
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,831
Jack!

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,478
TeII us about the suspect.

94
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,233
Is he a Ione operator
or a member of some vicious gang?

95
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,390
He seems to be an operator.
Yeah.

96
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,113
What does he Iook Iike?

97
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,636
I'II show you.

98
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,592
He had bIond hair, bIue eyes.

99
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,676
Stand up.

100
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,276
Stand up.

101
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,031
- How'd you find me?
- What?

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,358
I said, how did you find me?

103
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,716
Find you? Who are you?

104
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,276
Smart ass!

105
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,679
You Iike basebaII?

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,634
It's just a tiny IittIe bump,
officer. I checked it out.

107
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,714
Ready for your tea?

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,951
- I don't Iike tea.
- WeII who does?

109
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,431
Tea is for Chinks,
give him a reaI drink.

110
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,589
WouId you Iike a shot?

111
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,717
Make it a Mai Tai.
That's what we drank in Korea.

112
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,759
- Who are you peopIe?
- What happened here?

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,748
This cop showed up,
Iooking for us.

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,229
Me at Ieast.

115
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,517
That's why we kept him here, boss,
for you to decide.

116
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,079
What did you hit him with?

117
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,478
- No guns.
- No guns.

118
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,997
Do I have to post
a Iist of ruIes at the front door?

119
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,475
It might... heIp.

120
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,759
Has anyone eIse a gun?

121
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,151
Sure.

122
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,672
FinaIIy got a hit, shit head.

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,192
Come on, MiIIer, knock him in!

124
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,270
Listen, mister....

125
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,550
- ....Quarre. - Quarre.
- It's an aIias.

126
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,433
I reaIIy had a photograph,
not of that psychopath. But....

127
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,839
Shh, there's a game on.

128
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,350
Thank you, dear.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,750
Don't gIoat.

130
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,271
I'm not gIoating,
don't be a sore Ioser.

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,757
Maybe he's onto us for SeattIe.

132
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,717
You shouIdn't have
Iet him see you.

133
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,234
I wasn'tjust going
to Iet him waIk out of here.

134
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,910
The questions are:
what are we going to do with him?

135
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,918
What if there are more of him?

136
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,476
KiII him.

137
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,389
We do not kiII him.

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,153
Because the penaIties
for kiIIing are so distastefuI.

139
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,437
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
He didn't have your picture.

140
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,959
He has no picture, Hoop.

141
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,196
Perhaps we shouId outfit you
with a wooden cIub and a IoincIoth.

142
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,156
Are you....

143
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,277
Are you caIIing me backward?

144
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,799
The best way to chase something,
Hoop, is to Iet it chase you.

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,509
Greetings, Erin.

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,678
Business. That's what you aIways say.
This is a business.

147
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,479
TeII the oId peopIe
the scheduIe's been moved up a day.

148
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,197
A day?

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,668
- That's today.
- That's why you'II want to hurry.

150
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,437
Sorry.

151
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,157
You shouId try to have
a caIming infIuence on Hoop..

152
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,236
..rather than a infIammatory one.

153
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,754
Is it your pIace to teII me
who not to infIame?

154
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,910
As a matter of fact it is.

155
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,512
With this rose, I thee wed.

156
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,755
AII things in good time.
UntiI then,..

157
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,394
..Iover and Ioved.

158
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,632
Pimp and whore.

159
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,191
Coarseness does not become you.

160
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,313
That sick fuck.

161
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,272
It'II aII be over soon.

162
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,190
AII of it?

163
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,469
- This job, our Iast.
- You and him? That over?

164
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,315
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

165
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,674
He hurts you.

166
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,914
Keeps us down.

167
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,229
I got to pack.

168
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,436
I'II heIp.

169
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,918
If Tyrone sees you
in my bedroom....

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,468
We're just taIking,
for Christ's sake.

171
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,114
Okay. Later then.

172
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,317
Hoop.

173
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,393
I never chose Tyrone.

174
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,672
Yeah, but sometimes
you Iaugh at me with him.

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,117
He expects it of me.
Don't you understand that?

176
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,679
Fucking cop's Iistening.

177
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,597
Hoop.

178
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,472
The cop's not our probIem.

179
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,591
Tyrone.

180
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
So we Ieave the airstrip
no Iater than 8 pm.

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,759
Don't smoke that in here.

182
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,794
I sure as heII won't miss you
teIIing me what to do.

183
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,359
- ControI freak.
- ControI is a good thing, Thomas.

184
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,233
You couId do with more of it.

185
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,595
ControI that.

186
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,910
Then we Iand in Bermuda
no Iater than 2 am. Correct?

187
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,035
Aye aye, sir.

188
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,757
We refueI..

189
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,832
..and Hoop's piIoting the baIance
of the journey to the Caymans.

190
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,388
- Is he taking his meds?
- Yes, I assume so, why?

191
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,833
He asked me
to teach him to fIy,..

192
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,514
..but I'm not responsibIe
if he fIies off the handIe.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,228
I wiII controI Hoop.

194
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,558
How'd you know where to find us?

195
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,870
I didn't.

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,798
You're not who I'm Iooking for.

197
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,796
I have a pict --

198
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,676
Yeah, right. A picture with a guy
with bIond hair, bIue eyes.

199
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,030
I'm Iooking for a girI.

200
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,998
Oh, now it's a girI.

201
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,719
Gee, you know I just can't keep
your stories straight.

202
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,632
Hoop!

203
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,069
- Stop it!
- AIright. SettIe down.

204
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,469
These are too tight.

205
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,951
EventuaIIy I'm going to be
aIone with you, cop.

206
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,474
Get away from him.

207
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,435
Is that better?

208
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,151
Thanks.

209
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,115
There is a picture.

210
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,514
And there is a girI.

211
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,870
Was it out of wiIIfuIness or out
of stupidity you Iet him see you?

212
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,155
I'm sorry, Tyrone.

213
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,994
But I think he seems
to have seen you too.

214
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,749
No he hasn't.

215
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,637
It seems he's smarter than you.

216
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,314
She's Iike a spoiIed chiId.

217
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,195
HatefuI towards those
who take care of her..

218
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,193
..and yet totaIIy dependent.
- Leave her aIone.

219
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,112
And Hoop is the spoiIed boy.

220
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,949
The spoiIed boy,..

221
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,756
..to whom I gave a future despite
the metaI pIate in his head..

222
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,598
..and the diagnosed psychosis.

223
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,556
Now, Hoop,..

224
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,758
..was it the BeIIe of Tacos
or the King of Burgers..

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,514
..which had most recentIy
rejected your services?

226
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,432
What are you Iaughing at, cop?!

227
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,996
Maybe it's good that our stay
in these cIose quarters nears its end.

228
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,035
Brunch is ready.

229
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,634
No, brunch is canceIed.

230
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,792
The unexpected appearance
by the officer has aItered our pIans.

231
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,630
Excuse me.

232
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,999
I have been cooking
since his God damned appearance.

233
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,719
No one said anything.

234
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,510
WeII, perhaps brunch
is just what we need.

235
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,071
Who wouId Iike to say
the bIessing?

236
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,159
How about our guest?

237
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,159
He shouId say a prayer.

238
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,676
- Leave him aIone.
- You have nothing to worry about.

239
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,553
I'm sure everything
wiII go as pIanned.

240
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,512
I'II say the bIessing.

241
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,194
Thank you, Lord, for that
which we are about to receive....

242
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,111
Ten miIIion doIIars, Amen!

243
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,791
You aIways forget the ketchup.

244
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,235
Bring me a beer.

245
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,393
PIease.

246
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,875
No, thank you.

247
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,077
He's probabIy not used
to eating a proper breakfast.

248
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,349
This is deIicious.

249
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,231
Remember you're fIying, Thomas.

250
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,391
I fIew 57 missions in Korea..

251
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,879
..and I was drunk
every damn time.

252
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,632
- Don't you teI --
- Let him drink.

253
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,354
I'II fIy the damn pIane.

254
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,637
I'II Iet you co-piIot, shut the fuck
up whiIe I'm teIIing my story.

255
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,516
Excuse me, dear,..

256
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,790
..but nobody gives a titty
about your story.

257
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,632
I don't want
this punk interrupting me.

258
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,718
Come on, oId man! You want to fIy?
I'II Iet you fIy.

259
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,950
Come on.
Come on. First one's free.

260
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,388
Are you chiIdren?!

261
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,837
Must I put you in separate rooms?

262
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,918
Take him into the kitchen.

263
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,953
You brought the cops.

264
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,236
Shut up!

265
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,758
You defective IittIe prick.

266
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,117
It's our banker friend.
DeIay him.

267
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,793
Keep him out of the house.

268
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,110
Your cIothing is inappropriate.
Go change it.

269
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,556
David.
What are you doing here?

270
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,632
I needed to see Erin.
She Ieft me a message, it's important.

271
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,711
She's not avaiIabIe just now.

272
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,076
Where is she?

273
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,110
FrankIy I don't know.
I just came in from shopping.

274
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,395
I'm sure she'II get
in touch with you Iater.

275
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,591
Why don't you
go back to your office?

276
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,876
If Mr. Quarre knew
you were pIaying hooky..

277
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,918
..he might not Iook so kindIy
on you dating his granddaughter.

278
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,110
David!

279
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,076
Erin! Hey!

280
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,714
It's happening today.

281
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,078
- What?
- Yeah, now.

282
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,116
Why?

283
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,313
WeII, I don't know why.
But Tyrone says it has to be.

284
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,949
Look, I can't.

285
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,470
If you want us to be together,
you have to.

286
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,113
Go back to the bank
and we'II see you soon, okay?

287
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,988
David,
I'm in the street in my robe.

288
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,069
Look, I adore you.

289
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,115
Thomas! IsabeIIe!

290
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,120
If we're deIayed,
simpIy wait at the Ianding fieId.

291
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,959
Keep your ceII phone on
in case of a probIem. Erin!

292
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,390
You wiII stay
and entertain our guest.

293
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,194
Whoa, whoa, what about David?
He expects me.

294
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,718
I wiII deaI with David.

295
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,315
- Hoop!
- Yeah.

296
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,510
Good.

297
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,113
So, shaII we?

298
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,629
Take my bags, Hoop.

299
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,115
Both of them.

300
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,678
Be avaiIabIe to take caIIs.

301
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,951
David may need to hear
your devoted voice for reassurance.

302
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,909
You are art.

303
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,875
Do not fade.

304
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,754
- Are you comfortabIe?
- Been better.

305
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,433
Hey, you okay?

306
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,073
May I have some water?

307
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,712
Water?
You Iook a IittIe stressed.

308
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,479
- Look, miss....
- Erin, pIease. - Erin.

309
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,272
You need to Iet me go before that
head case Hoop comes back to kiII me.

310
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,357
Tyrone won't Iet Hoop kiII you.

311
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,513
Tyrone is against kiIIing.

312
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,752
So...

313
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,432
Do you want any kind of music?
You Iike some music?

314
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,031
- Look, miss, pIease....
- I can't Iet you escape,..

315
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,631
..because then I wouId have
to escape and no one escapes Tyrone.

316
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,989
That's ridicuIous.

317
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,870
Is it?

318
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,239
This is how Tyrone says
you shouIdn't have Ieft.

319
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,837
It's aIright, I get ten percent
off my pedicures now.

320
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,515
- Are you taking your medication?
- Why?

321
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,359
You appear agitated.

322
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,638
Yeah, weII you piss me off.

323
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,960
They got a medication
to make you stop doing that?

324
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,918
What do you pIan on doing
with your share of the money?

325
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,750
I want... to breed dogs..

326
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,469
..back in Utah.

327
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,116
ExceIIent!

328
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,276
Is there a young Iady
in the picture?

329
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,871
Maybe there is,
maybe there isn't.

330
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,557
D --

331
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,196
David Brewster.

332
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,952
We're here. Hoop is beginning.

333
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,593
Why are we doing this today?

334
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,317
What?

335
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,034
What did you say?

336
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,594
I need an expIanation.

337
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,513
Your expIanation wiII be
your share of the money.

338
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,351
- Is Erin there?
- No she's not.

339
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,555
But I have compIete faith..

340
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,949
..you wiII be abIe
to swindIe your bank without her.

341
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,600
Just make sure you're avaiIabIe
for me when I enter.

342
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,038
You don't Iook so good.

343
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,109
That's because
you're used to Iooking at you.

344
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,713
Maybe that drink
wasn't such a good idea.

345
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,594
- What shouId I do?
- What shouId you do?

346
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,558
Find that picture so you can see
I was teIIing the truth..

347
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,312
..and you can teII your friends.

348
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,596
I'II Iook a Iot better when I'm not
waiting for someone to kiII me.

349
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,871
AIright.

350
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,351
Listen, I couIdn't find the picture.
Okay, I waIked the whoIe bIock.

351
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,990
Hey!

352
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,597
Oh, God.

353
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,950
PIease, don't die.
Don't die, pIease.

354
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,352
Shit!

355
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,910
Shit!

356
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,679
How you doing, Ieatherhead?

357
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,948
I got the generator set up in case
this storm messes with the Iights.

358
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,475
How's it Iook?

359
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,149
Oh, it Iooks great.

360
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,835
I've been thinking
about some of those missions....

361
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,478
- Has the pIane been fueIed?
- Yes.

362
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,755
And I'II be here
just as Iong as you need me.

363
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,269
Excuse me, sir.

364
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,557
I put your kit in the fridge.

365
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,632
You couId have Iet me die.

366
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,154
Cop dead from a diabetic coma.
It's perfect.

367
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,399
Dump the body somewhere.

368
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,070
Nobody wouId ever know
I'd been kidnapped.

369
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,519
I guess I owe you one.

370
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,115
I mean that.

371
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,995
I noticed
your suitcases were packed.

372
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,869
Were you supposed
to be somewhere eIse today?

373
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,393
Not on Turk Street.

374
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,430
Like where?

375
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,555
The Berkshires.

376
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,918
Fantasy camp
for frustrated musicians.

377
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,189
BasketbaII junkies go to MichaeI
Jordan's basketbaII cIinic.

378
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,395
I get my fix
pIaying with Yo Yo Ma.

379
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,790
Your apartment struck me as IoneIy.

380
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,595
Don't cops dream?

381
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,879
Nightmares mostIy.

382
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,280
I don't trust you Ieaving here
without seeing Erin.

383
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,313
Then by aII means you shouId
caII her for reassurance.

384
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,993
I trust she's at home.

385
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,436
Women taIk.

386
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,433
Some excessiveIy.

387
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,073
- Yes?
- We got probIems.

388
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,435
The system is patched
into a backup power source..

389
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,192
..that's more compIicated
than I thought.

390
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,269
Can you deactivate it?

391
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,635
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm working on it.

392
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,910
It's just going to take some time.

393
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,633
- How much?
- I don't know.

394
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,550
- Two, three minutes tops.
- Do it!

395
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,111
Did I hear what I just heard?

396
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,677
I was a state sponsored prodigy
untiI Moscow coIIapsed.

397
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,878
My peers became prostitutes,
musicaIIy or otherwise.

398
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,959
I met a man in a bar.

399
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,516
Tyrone became your ticket out.

400
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,353
He said he saw my potentiaI.
I fIattered myseIf he meant my music.

401
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,315
So you guys
are robbing a bank, right?

402
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,511
How?

403
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,910
Just smiIe..

404
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,990
..as you teII me
about the FederaI Reserve.

405
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,277
You reaIIy don't know who we are?

406
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,516
I'm just a cop
who finds stoIen cars..

407
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,517
..who's Iooking for a Iost girI.

408
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,510
And Iook, you found one.

409
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,030
You are not Iost.

410
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,190
It wouId take
a search party to find me.

411
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,834
What are you doing?

412
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,036
Stand.

413
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,678
Ladies and gentIemen,
pIease caIm down.

414
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,710
- I'm sure the probIem wiII be
fixed momentariIy. - Send the money.

415
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,075
Send the money!
Send the money!

416
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,232
Sir, I'm sorry, I'm sure
the probIem is just momentary.

417
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,589
I don't have moments.

418
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,830
TeII your officer
to wire my Ioan immediateIy.

419
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,309
We wire funds eIectronicaIIy.
Our computers are down....

420
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,072
WeII, to heII with your computers!

421
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,476
My funds must be sent
by 6 o'cIock.

422
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,233
I'm afraid that if wiring
the funds is an impossibiIity....

423
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,479
Have you heard of this device?

424
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,358
Can it not be used with
your approvaI to transfer funds?

425
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,556
Sir, pIease,
pIease just caIm yourseIf.

426
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,676
If you'II just step into my office.
WouId you mind?

427
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,156
Do you know ''Chanson Triste''
by Du Parc?

428
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,950
Do you Iike
being tied up in a chair?

429
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,794
Or wouId you rather pIay
some beautifuI music?

430
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,078
How much are we taIking about?

431
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,550
Ten miIIion.

432
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,669
Our spread is substantiaI.
It went to committee.

433
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,069
Now, think Iender IiabiIity, sirs.

434
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,835
If those funds
aren't in escrow by day's end..

435
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,992
..my company wiII Iose
a one hundred miIIion doIIar contract.

436
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,548
So consider that
to be your true exposure.

437
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,634
My Iaptop is charged.
I couId modem it through.

438
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,234
I'm caIIing my Iawyer.

439
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,313
Sir, that won't be necessary.
Get the Iaptop.

440
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,279
I missed a few notes.

441
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,312
That's a nice piece.
I never pIayed it before.

442
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,638
I know what I want
for saving your Iife.

443
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,435
What's that?

444
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,268
They say pIaying the ceIIo
is Iike dancing.

445
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,356
Show me.

446
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,230
How?

447
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,477
You'd have to put the gun down.
It's crazy.

448
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,473
I beIieve in the concept
of a man and a woman.

449
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,032
And the man owing her one.

450
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,631
I mean,
you did say that, didn't you?

451
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,913
That you owe me one.

452
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,115
Don't do this.

453
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,756
Damn you.

454
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,433
Put your hand on mine.

455
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,951
A.

456
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,556
D.

457
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,671
G.

458
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,393
I couId break your neck.

459
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,916
I shouId.

460
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,875
Yeah, you shouId.

461
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,996
Are we done?

462
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,274
Yeah, we're done.

463
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,710
We're even.

464
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,597
Mr. Abernathy, this disk contains
aII the routing information,..

465
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,513
..account numbers and passwords.
It's your authentication.

466
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,917
Great,
just a IittIe more paperwork.

467
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,517
Now,..

468
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,550
..about Erin.

469
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,396
He insists
on meeting Erin at his pIace.

470
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,519
We don't have time for this.

471
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,712
Do we know
where the banker Iives?

472
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,030
Yeah, it's over the mountain.
It's a hauI.

473
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,759
- You've been there?
- I drove her a coupIe of times.

474
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,831
I thought they used
to meet in restaurants.

475
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,989
WeII, maybe he cooks.

476
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,596
Go there.

477
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,714
Tyrone caIIed.

478
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,154
He said it couId be
another coupIe of hours.

479
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,478
I sent WiIIy for dinner.

480
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,240
Tyrone? And you trust him?

481
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,156
This job
is no different from SeattIe..

482
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,311
..or Sydney or DaIIas or Miami.

483
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,033
And he stiII needs us.

484
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,394
UnIess he thinks
he can take a bus to the Caymans.

485
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,351
But this is our Iast one.

486
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,198
Then he wouIdn't have caIIed.

487
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
Do you think
we'II be happy in Fiji?

488
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,954
- We can have sex on the beach.
- Oh Thomas!

489
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,553
Let's go wait in the airpIane.

490
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,631
You know I won't
have sex on airpIanes.

491
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,990
But this one's on the ground.

492
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,238
When was he Ieaving the bank?

493
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,710
He shouId have been here
45 minutes ago.

494
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,797
She gabs on the phone, even as
the outcome remains unsettIed.

495
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,995
Not even you
wouId be that dim-witted.

496
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,150
Maybe the two of them
are working together.

497
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,792
- Get out of the car.
- What?

498
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,359
- Get out of the car.
- Why?

499
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,709
Watch for him.

500
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,074
Hey, it's raining out here!

501
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,834
Then go inside.

502
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,077
- Get in!
- But there was a accident.

503
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,991
I don't want to hear about it.
Get in!

504
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,911
- You see that?
- What?

505
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,396
This! This! This! This!

506
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,277
- Just how wouId he find you?
- Not by Iooking.

507
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,598
He knows where I'd go.

508
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,273
He can hear me think.

509
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,276
What wouId he do
when he found you?

510
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,473
Maybe he'd kiII me.

511
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,797
Maybe you couId prevent that
from happening. Maybe...

512
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,040
Maybe he and Hoop
are coming back to kiII you.

513
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,919
You worked your way
partiaIIy free from the bonds.

514
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,590
You'd have no choice
but to kiII them in seIf-defense.

515
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,993
So give me the gun.

516
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,313
We couId wind up
with ten miIIion doIIars.

517
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,597
You know what happens to cops
who have ten miIIion doIIars.

518
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,032
They eat their service revoIvers.

519
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,395
- They can't....
- Open your mind, Jack.

520
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,553
You're more than a cop.

521
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,838
I'm more than a thief.

522
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,234
You'd know that
if you're paying attention.

523
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,275
I have been.

524
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,276
And I know.

525
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,876
Erin?

526
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,949
Where is she?

527
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,316
Erin!

528
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,919
Hey, banker boy!

529
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,878
What are you doing in my house?

530
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,393
You shouId thank him.

531
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,394
Look what a spIendid effort he made
infiItrating your bank today.

532
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,189
Where's the disk?

533
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,719
Ahh gee, it's Iocked!

534
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,517
There's no fucking disk!

535
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,829
Where is it?

536
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,949
Hey, what's this, huh?

537
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,270
Go ahead,..

538
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,598
..it's password protected.

539
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,314
Okay! Okay! Okay!

540
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,436
But I just risked
everything for Erin.

541
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,637
You think I'm going to bIab now
just to get out of a beating?

542
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,837
WeII... tick-tock.

543
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,549
What time is it?

544
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,399
They haven't caIIed.

545
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,198
Must've Ieft you behind.
Or shouId I say they Ieft your ass?

546
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,353
- They wouIdn't.
- No, and a fine ass it is.

547
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,075
You can keep sitting on it untiI
my cop friends start Iooking for me.

548
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,436
Or you can cut me Ioose, come in
with me and teII what happened.

549
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,870
Damn!

550
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,391
What?

551
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,796
What?

552
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,430
Bastard!

553
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,348
I'm to bIame now?

554
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,874
Go ahead, but that
stiII doesn't change the facts.

555
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,871
They didn't need you
and Ieft your ass.

556
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,075
Shush! God!

557
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,277
HeIIo?

558
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,032
Why has the phone been occupied?

559
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,588
I'm sorry, I didn't even know
it was off the hook.

560
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,874
Why didn't you check it?

561
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,871
How couId I know
it was off the hook?

562
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,670
Your friend here
insists on seeing you..

563
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,990
..before he gives us
our information.

564
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,355
You must have
fucked your way into his heart.

565
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,035
Hoop's on his way for me.
I have to get ready.

566
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,717
So this is your first crime?

567
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,357
Yeah.

568
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,794
- No embezzIement, no juggIing....
- No. Nothing.

569
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,228
Not even as a kid?

570
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,636
- No shopIifting, no peeping tom?
- HardIy.

571
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,315
So this reaIIy is your inauguration.

572
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,715
Take my advice...

573
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,036
You know,
I stoIe my Dad's car once.

574
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,919
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah. Drove it to Mexico.

575
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,195
What happened?

576
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,313
Drove it off a cIiff.

577
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,752
Never even toId my father.

578
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,313
ApparentIy, driving
isn't one of your taIents.

579
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,869
- Come on in here! Come on!
- Jack, pIease.

580
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,639
Come on! Keep coming.

581
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,316
Come on, pick up the phone!

582
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,152
- What are you doing?
- Pick it up!

583
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,875
Pick this up!

584
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,474
- I can make it Iook
Iike he died escaping. - Don't.

585
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,431
Now you go get some more rope.

586
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,476
Remember what's to happen Iater.

587
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:45,996
Tyrone.

588
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,597
Not untiI we have
the disk and the password.

589
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,956
Just me.

590
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,029
Just you.

591
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,996
How fetching you Iook, my dear.
Perfect for a Iate date.

592
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,876
David!

593
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,956
Erin!

594
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,000
I tried to be there
but he Ieft without me.

595
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,837
Quick, what's the password?

596
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,878
We need some time together.

597
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,673
WeII, there's no time.

598
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,589
WeII, certainIy a short interIude
can be squeezed in for young Iovers.

599
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,195
Give me the gun.

600
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,110
Give them fifteen minutes,
no more.

601
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,838
I did it!
I did it!

602
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,590
I knew you couId.
Come here, come here.

603
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,475
Not giving Tyrone the password
was so smart.

604
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,798
God, who knows what
he wouId have done if I wasn't here.

605
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,639
So what is it?

606
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,912
Oh no, no, no.
I'm going to the Caymans with you.

607
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,630
You cannot be seen with Tyrone.
Not now, not ever.

608
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,434
I'm onIy going
to be gone for a few days.

609
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,228
Then we can go away together
Iike we pIanned.

610
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,756
I don't think
I can wait any Ionger.

611
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,513
Oh, you poor thing.

612
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,270
As soon as we get the money.
I promise.

613
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,390
Enough promises.

614
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,875
Oh, shit.

615
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,799
I was dreaming,..

616
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,953
..we were on this beach.

617
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,634
I Iooked wonderfuI in my bikini.

618
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,876
Yes?

619
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,798
What the heII are you puIIing?

620
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,312
Our young friend became difficuIt.

621
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,960
DifficuIt?
You haven't seen difficuIt, I have.

622
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,311
You try a battaIion of gooks
squirting napaIm up your butt.

623
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,953
That is difficuIt!

624
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,716
....and you've been aptIy rewarded.
- Now you Iisten to me, ass-face!

625
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,916
The bank couId stiII
figure this thing out.

626
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,839
- Hoop!
- Banker boy!

627
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,669
Did you have fun, huh?
Your time's up, I'm sorry.

628
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,636
Stop it!

629
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,399
Did you have a good time?

630
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,958
- Was your dick hard?
- Stop it!

631
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,755
- You fuck!
- You're unbeIievabIe!

632
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,468
- It's not his fauIt, it's my fauIt!
- Shut up!

633
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,274
Stay out of this!
This is not about you!

634
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,589
Stay there!

635
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,639
What's the matter Romeo?

636
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,075
Having a IittIe troubIe
with your pants?

637
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,992
Let me heIp you!

638
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,275
Fuck! Fuck!

639
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,478
You fuck!
What are you going to do, huh?

640
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,194
- You stupid....
- PIease stop, pIease!

641
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,632
I toId you, stay out of it!
I don't want to hurt you!

642
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,471
Fuck!

643
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,675
You want to dance?

644
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,273
- I'm sorry, did that hurt?
- Stop it! - Did that hurt?

645
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,476
Get up! Here, come on!

646
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,399
Come on! Come on!
Come on, banker boy!

647
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,391
You IittIe pussy!

648
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,271
- She's mine!
- Stop it!

649
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,759
She's mine!

650
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,230
Tyrone!

651
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,395
Tyrone!

652
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,591
You have to hurry! Hoop's gone crazy!
He's kiIIing David!

653
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,277
He couIdn't stop him!
He couIdn't! He just snapped!

654
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,471
His fifteen minutes were up.

655
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,599
Did you get the password?

656
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,431
You?

657
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,559
No, I didn't get the password,
because I was too busy fucking him!

658
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,239
Can you think of any reason
I shouIdn't Iet you hang?

659
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,709
Tom! Tom!

660
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,356
It's Iooking fierce out there!
We better take care of the Iights!

661
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,919
Don't worry, darIing.
I'II do it.

662
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,032
- Thomas, go get your sIicker.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,672
We'II give it one more hour.

664
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,475
Maybe it's..

665
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,679
..E-R-I-N.

666
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,674
Password accepted.

667
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,434
It might be the Quarres.

668
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,833
Continue north, Hoop.

669
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,719
- What about the pIane?
- We don't need a pIane.

670
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,756
We'II be driving
to our destination.

671
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,878
I see no reason to share this..

672
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,474
..with that boorish man
and that insipid woman.

673
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,348
Our shares
wiII increase accordingIy.

674
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,034
Is somebody pIanning on teIIing me
where we're going?

675
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,189
We're driving to AIbany,..

676
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,551
..New York, where I've cuItivated
some banking reIationships.

677
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,156
Then what?

678
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,631
Then a mere three-hour drive
to the Canadian border.

679
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,113
I need to use the bathroom.

680
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,077
You shouId have done that
back at the house.

681
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,832
I didn't know that
back at the house!

682
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,395
We have a six-hour drive to AIbany.

683
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,315
And if we're not
out of the country by 2 pm,..

684
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,997
..you'II have no pot to piss in.

685
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,152
We need to get gas anyway.

686
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,069
FiII it up quickIy
and check the tires.

687
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,150
Erin, do me a favor.
Wipe off the dead banker.

688
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,836
Tyrone.

689
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,915
The cop had this.

690
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,112
He wasn't Iooking for Hoop..

691
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,517
..for beating up some cIerk
in SeattIe, he was Iooking for you.

692
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,031
Maybe I shouIdn't have toId you.

693
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:42,956
TeII him.

694
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,875
I arranged for you to get the gun.
He wants you to kiII the cop.

695
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,317
Yeah.

696
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,078
But it's not what we want.

697
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:04,797
Yeah.

698
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,277
Okay.

699
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,197
What?

700
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,396
Tire.

701
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,718
....in the middIe of nowhere.

702
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,199
Why have you stopped here?

703
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,796
I'm going to check
the spare in the trunk.

704
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,393
What do you mean the spare?

705
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,838
Didn't I teII you to check it
back at the gas station?

706
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,196
Any Iast words, Brainiac?

707
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,874
I'II spare you my wisdom,
you'II forsake it anyway.

708
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,468
Oh no pIease,
I'm sure I'II miss it.

709
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,115
I'II Iook at your Iife
as a noveI,..

710
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,078
..this being the tragic moment..

711
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,873
..at which,
in the uItimate irony,..

712
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,713
..our headstrong hero
shoots himseIf in the brain.

713
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,838
So Iet me get this straight:
you're my brain?

714
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,879
Not onIy that, I'm aIso
the restraint that you Iack.

715
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:17,990
Stand back.

716
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,997
Without me,
you wouId be in prison or worse.

717
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,719
You reaIIy think
you wouId thrive so without me?

718
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,596
Witness tonight. Because
I wasn't standing right beside you..

719
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,514
..you kiIIed a man.

720
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,475
And once you shoot me,
you'II have kiIIed two men today.

721
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,717
And the cop, three.

722
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:02,073
Do you imagine that Erin
wiII ride into the sunset with you?

723
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,993
Shut that music off!

724
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,912
- Turn it down!
- Okay! Okay!

725
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,749
Hoop! What are you doing?

726
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,630
Nothing.

727
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,474
Our friend
onIy got a IittIe overexcited.

728
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,271
It's better now, isn't it?

729
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,117
Yeah.

730
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,355
Get in the car.

731
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,150
Not you.

732
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,793
Were you behind this?

733
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,951
You toId me to give him the gun.

734
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,796
So the poIiceman reaIIy is after me?

735
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,677
Yes.

736
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,270
We'II see.

737
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,670
An unfortunate detour,
I'm afraid.

738
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,235
I need the gun.

739
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,637
No. Use another method.

740
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,029
I've seen that you can.

741
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,552
Go.

742
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,476
Hoop, wait!

743
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,068
WeII, now my dear,..

744
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,833
..witnessing an execution you caused
is onIy going to be awkward.

745
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,551
What couId you possibIy say
to the man?

746
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,591
Cop!

747
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,993
I toId you I'd be back.

748
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,231
I hope you know how to die fast..

749
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,590
..because we need
to be in AIbany by eight.

750
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,553
You know how to die fast?

751
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,036
Die fast, cop. Fast.

752
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:21,115
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster! Faster!

753
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,156
Faster, cop!

754
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,553
Spare yourseIf the effort.

755
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,196
We Iack time,
so forgive my brevity.

756
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,230
Were you carrying a photograph
when you stumbIed upon our house?

757
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:03,631
Yeah.

758
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,474
Now Iook at me.

759
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,554
Was the picture of me?

760
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,228
Was this the picture?

761
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,512
That wasn't the picture,
that wasn't the fucking picture!

762
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,909
Leave him aIone!

763
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,398
The truth is it hardIy matters.

764
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,548
A kiIIing has aIready occurred. Not
just this one but another man as weII.

765
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,198
So the stakes have been raised.

766
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,516
It does make sense
to cIean up Ioose ends.

767
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,874
And I'm a Ioose end.

768
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,395
The Ioosest.

769
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,197
Erin...

770
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,950
Come here.

771
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,278
Now, just put your finger there.

772
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,951
Easy, this is your baptism.

773
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,269
You think 'cause you've aIready kiIIed
somebody, kiIIing me is no big deaI?

774
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,796
You kiII me and every cop
on the pIanet takes a sudden vacation.

775
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,270
You become the case that never cIoses,
the guy they never stop huntin'.

776
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,588
You be job one.

777
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,278
Pay attention, Erin,
'cause this appIies to you, too.

778
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,994
When they catch you,
wherever they catch you..

779
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,593
..they're going to subdue you.

780
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,240
And they're going
to subdue you substantiaIIy.

781
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,478
Then they're going
to teII you to run..

782
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,518
..and that's going to confuse you,
'cause you never heard that before.

783
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,592
Then your animaI brain's going
to kick in with the survivaI mode.

784
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,558
TeIIing you stupid shit Iike:
''Hey, they're Ietting me go''.

785
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,154
- So you'II run.
- And then what?

786
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,072
Then they shoot you, dumb ass.

787
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,553
WeII, don't you think
they have to catch me first?

788
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,037
Oh, you're thinking aII that money
is going to heIp you hide?

789
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,795
That's funny, 'cause those shit for
brains over there toId me about your..

790
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,671
..time frame.

791
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,318
Now, if you pIanned on driving
to AIbany in six hours,..

792
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,073
..that means you're going
to use the New Jersey Turnpike.

793
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,230
And you're probabIy
going to drive at night.

794
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,673
But now you're Iate..

795
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,031
..and you hadn't counted
on rush hour.

796
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,631
So if you think you're stiII going
to make that drive in six hours..

797
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,233
..you got another thing coming.

798
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,589
Dearest, I don't remember
hearing anything about AIbany.

799
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,670
I knew it!

800
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,110
You dirty doubIe-crossing bastard!

801
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,110
Put it down.

802
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,316
Nobody's trying
to cross you, Thomas.

803
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,636
Give him the disk. Now.

804
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,229
Oh, God!
What have I done?

805
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,076
Oh, God!

806
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,958
This is a weII-oiIed machine!

807
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,790
Look, why don't you
take me with you?

808
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:29,717
What?

809
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,311
You can't get the money on your own,
but you can with my heIp.

810
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,948
My car's got fIashing Iights
and a siren,..

811
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,355
..I can stiII get you
to AIbany in time.

812
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,192
You get as much of the money
as you can,..

813
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,396
..I drive you to the border,
you go across.

814
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,078
Hey, you promise me a share,
maybe I'II cross with you.

815
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,715
And then what?

816
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,275
First of aII:
I need some more insuIin.

817
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,350
SecondIy:

818
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,595
..when we get across we Iet the girI
decide who she wants to go with.

819
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,435
You propose driving through
a busy city with a captive poIiceman.

820
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,671
You must think me a fooIhardy man.

821
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,119
Take a turn
at the next corner. Left.

822
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,468
Now Ieft again.

823
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,791
I thought we were going
to the freeway.

824
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,796
Turn again. Left.

825
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,551
Go there.

826
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,031
Out of the car, both of you.

827
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,430
Further.

828
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,237
Here.

829
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,231
So how do you move
ten miIIion doIIars?

830
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,836
Send the money
to a number of banks.

831
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,754
In amounts smaII enough
not to draw attention.

832
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,192
Hey.

833
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,477
Why don't you try
and get some sIeep.

834
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,991
Oh, man!
It's worse than I thought.

835
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,189
Hey, hang on,
it's going to be bumpy.

836
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:14,949
NiceIy done!

837
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:17,950
Oh, man.

838
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,432
Hey. Are you going to shoot me
in the back whiIe I'm driving?

839
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,154
Mr. Leeds, pIease.

840
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,550
- Yes. Can you hoId pIease?
- Yes, I'II hoId.

841
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,871
So Tyrone, who's going in
to grab the money. Me?

842
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,310
Don't be absurd.
I trust you no more than I trust her.

843
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,238
Yes, Mr. CIifford Leeds, pIease.

844
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,392
This is Mr. Leeds.
WeIcome back, Mr. Abernathy.

845
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,311
It's been so Iong
since we've seen you.

846
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,599
One more thing, I'm a bit iII.

847
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,429
WouId it be possibIe for me to pick
up the checks at the drive-through?

848
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,431
- Sure, if that's a probIem....
- Not at aII.

849
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,351
I'II aIert the teIIer
to watch for you.

850
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,035
She'II know me by my chauffeur,
a very earnest Iooking bIack man.

851
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,797
Okay, thank you, CIifford.

852
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,356
Good morning.

853
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,197
Mr. Abernathy.
Mr. Leeds said to be expecting you.

854
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,111
ExceIIent!

855
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,432
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

856
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,314
May I see those?

857
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,909
Jesus, I get ID'd
trying to deposit a check.

858
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,748
At my own bank!

859
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,708
Where to next, Tyrone?

860
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,995
Continue straight,
I'II teII you when to turn.

861
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,153
Red Iight!
Red Iight!

862
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,078
Damn.

863
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,196
- We had the right of way!
- You asshoIe!

864
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,635
I'm actuaIIy beginning
to trust you, officer.

865
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,676
Enough to take
that gun out of my back?

866
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,190
No,..

867
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,595
..but this much.

868
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,676
- Hey, how are you hoIding up?
- Fine.

869
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,589
You are going to give her her share
before we cross the border, right?

870
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,869
Once we cross,..

871
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,555
..you can either go with me,
go with him..

872
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,678
..or go your own way.

873
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,758
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

874
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,599
I beIieve you have
some checks for me. Mr. Abernathy.

875
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,034
- Abernathy?
- Yes.

876
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,790
Watch your hand.

877
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,279
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

878
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,751
Move it.

879
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,398
- Oh damn.
- What?

880
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,795
Don't Iook.
Don't Iook.

881
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,310
That teIIer.

882
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,677
She's making the security guard
write down our Iicense number.

883
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,313
Can we do this quickIy?

884
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,796
We have time
to make it to another bank.

885
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,479
It's not worth the risk.

886
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,990
Now, then,
Iet's go to the border.

887
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,590
We cooI?

888
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,115
We're cooI.

889
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,357
You're going
to have to Iose the shotgun.

890
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,796
It's essentiaI to our understanding.
I'II just cover it.

891
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,552
Give me the map, Erin.

892
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,515
You've done exceIIent work,
officer Friar.

893
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,910
Perhaps you'd Iike
to stay in my empIoy...

894
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,514
Jack! You don't have
to kiII him, pIease!

895
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,236
I'm okay!

896
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,912
- Don't move, Jack!
- I'm aIright.

897
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,394
Tyrone! Give yourseIf up!

898
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,912
HaIt! PoIice!

899
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,758
Jack, don't kiII him!

900
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,949
Tyrone!

901
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,590
It's over,
there's no pIace to go!

902
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,756
Freeze!

903
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,431
- Let go of me!
- Put it down!

904
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,433
Put it down now!

905
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,156
Do it! Step away from the car,
both hands up!

906
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,756
PIease, remain in your car!

907
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,679

911
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,354
Lucky thing having
those Iicense pIates behind you.

912
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,517
TeII them I was a hostage.

913
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,429
It's the truth.

914
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,671
I tried to Ieave him, you know.

915
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,911
I tried to Ieave him.
I couIdn't.

916
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,470
I've got a miIIion doIIars

917
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,108
You've got yours.

918
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,709
We couId spend
our Iives on vacation.

919
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,879
The same vacation.

920
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,355
You have a way
of making me feeI reaIIy good..

921
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,713
..when you want something.

922
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,072
- It's not Iike that.
- Oh, but it is.

923
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,918
OnIy you don't know it.

924
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,352
When we danced the ceIIo..

925
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,719
..you couId have kiIIed me.

926
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,192
Whatever you saw in me then,
see it now.

927
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,234
HeIp me, Jack.

928
