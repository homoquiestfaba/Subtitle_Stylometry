1
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,936
- You the new girl?

2
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,604
- Yes. Hi.

3
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,372
- Okay, well, I've been
out front looking for you

4
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,307
for the past 15 minutes.

5
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,009
- Oh, I'm sorry.

6
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,342
I, they told me to wait here.

7
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,645
- All right, come on.

8
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,512
I wanna get to the lanes

9
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,748
before they run outta half price
wings.

10
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,920
Supplies are in here.

11
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,353
We run low on anything,

12
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,689
you write it down on this
clipboard.

13
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:42,590
Got it?

14
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,260
Your shirt should be over there.

15
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,435
What'd you say your name was?

16
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,304
- Um, Karen.

17
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,941
- My ex-wife's name was Karen.

18
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,342
- I'm sorry.

19
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,184
Hey, Tina.

20
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,720
Is everything okay? How is she
feeling?

21
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:13,755
She threw it up again?

22
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,389
I was really hoping she'd
keep something down.

23
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,491
Um...

24
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,597
Maybe next time try
again with some crackers.

25
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:29,504
Uh, just try that and
yes, please clean it up.

26
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,540
Thank you again for staying with
her.

27
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,574
I've gotta go.

28
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,545
- Is that gonna be a problem?

29
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,748
- No, no. I'm sorry.

30
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,416
I've got a sick little one at
home.

31
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,520
My neighbor's with her and she
has kids

32
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,855
but she acts like she's
never seen a sick one before.

33
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,924
- The boss man doesn't take too
kindly

34
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,726
to personal business on his
dime,

35
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,493
so don't have that out anymore.

36
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,329
- Got it.

37
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,101
- Have you worked in a
place like this before?

38
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,602
- No, sir.

39
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,604
- You can see it's dirty.

40
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,807
Floors need to be swept each
night.

41
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,743
Bathrooms.

42
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:13,781
Clean 'em, mop 'em, refill
the soap, paper towels, TP.

43
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,417
Empty the trash from each
office.

44
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,352
Vacuum each office and hallway.

45
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,723
Close all the doors.

46
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,958
Make sure they're locked.

47
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,494
We had a break in at a plant
down the road the other night.

48
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,664
We don't want that here.

49
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,498
Why don't you go get these.

50
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,043
Also, no smoking inside.

51
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:42,977
- I don't smoke.

52
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,479
- You will if you stay here long
enough.

53
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,953
You married?

54
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:52,820
- Why?

55
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,487
- Just asking.

56
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,890
You said you had a kid and all.

57
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,492
- No, I'm not.

58
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,940
- This one's a little tricky.

59
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,943
You really gotta work it.

60
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,912
Oh, I hate this door.

61
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,750
- I think you got something on,
um-

62
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,085
- Ah, dammit.

63
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:26,087
- Wait, wait.

64
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,121
Don't, don't rub it in.

65
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,022
Hold on.

66
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,562
Give me your shirt.

67
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,904
I have an old injury.

68
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,038
Can you open this?

69
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,883
- What the hell?

70
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,020
Where did you learn that from?

71
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:02,823
- School. Good old family
and consumer sciences class.

72
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,858
- Sounds made up.

73
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,159
- Oh, it's real, all right.

74
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,862
- Don't think by knowing this
fancy stuff

75
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,964
you're gonna be getting my job
or nothin'.

76
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,066
- Don't we have the same job?

77
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,068
- No, I'm day shift.

78
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,538
- There you go.

79
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,177
- Not bad, Kathy.

80
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,078
- It's Karen.

81
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,049
Like your ex-wife.

82
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,551
- Yeah, right.

83
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,621
Well, I'm off.

84
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,156
Any last questions?

85
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,627
- Does anybody else work night
shift?

86
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,696
- Nope. Just you.

87
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,233
I, uh, hope your kid
gets to feeling better.

88
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,134
- Thank you.

89
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,073
- Well look at this shit.

90
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,643
- Mm-mm-mm.

91
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:30,778
Fresh meat.

92
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,583
- Nah, this is Danny's old lady.

93
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,717
- No shit?

94
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:40,087
- Or ex old lady, guess I should
say.

95
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,022
Ain't that right?

96
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:46,260
Whoa, careful. Don't
wanna burn yourself now.

97
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,800
You know she served him divorce
papers

98
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,702
right there at the construction
site.

99
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,105
In front of his foreman and
everybody.

100
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,708
- You don't know me.

101
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,110
- I know anyone gonna deny a man

102
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:06,814
from seeing his little
girl on her birthday

103
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,883
is a fuckin' bitch.

104
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:11,786
- Come on, man.

105
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,795
- You missed a spot.

106
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,062
- Shit.

107
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:05,587
Oh, it's nasty.

108
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,987
Hey, Tina.

109
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,556
- I know you said not to
call,

110
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,593
but your kid is crying and
I can't get her to stop.

111
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:12,527
- Is she okay?

112
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,528
- I don't know.

113
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,030
She's going on about her
dad's gone, you're gone.

114
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:19,500
I told her you're just at
work, but she won't listen.

115
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,335
You want me to say what
happened to her dad?

116
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:25,205
- No, no, don't say anything.

117
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,508
Just...

118
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,409
- What do I need to do?

119
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,378
- Okay, um, let me talk to her.

120
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,155
- Mom?

121
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,923
- Hey baby.

122
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,526
What's the matter? Are you okay?

123
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,528
- Where are you?

124
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:48,195
- I'm at work.

125
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,164
Remember I told you I
was going to be working

126
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,065
while you're asleep?

127
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,334
- No.
- Yes, you do.

128
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,538
That's why Miss Tina's there to
watch you.

129
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:58,272
- Are you coming back?

130
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,207
- Yes, of course I am.

131
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,545
I'll be there when you wake up.
I promise.

132
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,913
And then we'll make breakfast.
Okay?

133
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,482
- Eggs Benedict?

134
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,151
- No, maybe pancakes.

135
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,554
- Okay.

136
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,487
- Okay, baby.

137
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,322
I love you.

138
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,659
- Love you, too.

139
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,960
- Can you give the
phone back to Miss Tina?

140
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,128
- Yeah.

141
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,205
- Yeah?

142
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,674
- I'm sorry about that.

143
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,942
I think she'll be all right.

144
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,210
How's her fever?

145
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,444
- I dunno.

146
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,547
- Well, will you take her
temperature?

147
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,517
- Pretty sure it's gone.

148
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,151
She don't feel hot.

149
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,654
- Will you just take it with a
thermometer

150
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,389
and text me back and let me
know?

151
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,058
- Fine.

152
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,428
I'll do it in a minute
when things settle down.

153
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,630
- What things?

154
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:59,066
- Well, this dog out
here is barking like crazy.

155
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,200
Shut up dog!

156
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:02,637
Ugh.

157
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,471
Oh, and the land lady stopped
by.

158
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:06,440
Said you still owed for this
week.

159
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,710
- I know. I'm taking care of
that.

160
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,712
- I saw you got
a lot of bills here.

161
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,179
Are you gonna be able to pay me?

162
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,013
- Yes.

163
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,049
Now will you take her
temperature

164
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,018
and stop going through my mail?

165
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,221
- Fine.

166
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:29,096
- Hey, thank you again for
watching her.

167
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,230
I really do appreciate-

168
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,040
Hm.

169
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,328
- Hello?

170
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,430
- Delivery.

171
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,165
- Can you leave it by the door?

172
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,135
- I need a signature for it.

173
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:22,844
Sorry I'm running late.

174
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,444
The truck got a flat.

175
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:26,648
They put a rush on this, so
I figured it's important.

176
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,248
Machine part, I'm guessing.

177
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:29,182
Is Frank here?

178
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,251
- No.

179
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,219
- What about Wayne?

180
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,254
- Nope.

181
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,724
- Anyone besides you?

182
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,293
- No.

183
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,498
Uh, well, well, there's the
people in the back, but-

184
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:45,399
- Take care.

185
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,202
- Do I need to sign for this?
- No, you're good.

186
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,509
Hey.

187
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,404
- Oh, shit.

188
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:29,917
Fuck.

189
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:46,634
- Now find her.

190
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,800
- See
anything?

191
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,434
- No.

192
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:22,069
Check back here.

193
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,542
Guys, this way.

194
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,260
- Shit.

195
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,698
- Ow!

196
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,705
- Dammit!

197
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:40,941
- Here, here's here
phone.

198
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:54,822
- Fuck.

199
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,701
- Spread out.

200
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,994
Hey, go find every phone.

201
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,029
Start cuttin' the lines.

202
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:04,958
- Piece of shit.

203
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,483
Ugh, this fuckin' place.

204
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,345
- Hey, go
check on the breaker box.

205
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:41,549
I don't think it's the one down
here.

206
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:46,119
- Hey, I might
have something over here.

207
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,440
- You sure in
the clear?

208
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,611
Anybody check that closet right
there?

209
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:04,599
- The
longer you drag this out,

210
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:08,569
the more we're gonna
make you bleed, bitch.

211
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:56,383
- Fuckin'
bitch.

212
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,689
Don't go runnin' little piggy.

213
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:04,726
Your ass is mine now.

214
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:21,876
Fuckin' hell.

215
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,260
I see you.

216
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:06,319
You ain't gettin' away.

217
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,440
- Fuck.

218
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:51,132
- Bitch!

219
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,573
Come here, you slippery little
bitch.

220
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:04,545
Fuck!

221
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:10,918
You ain't gettin' away!

222
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:39,412
Come here!

223
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, shit!

224
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:14,135
- Piece of shit.

225
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:04,985
- Hey, hey, hey!

226
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,934
No, Eddie.

227
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,402
- Take the note.

228
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:25,172
- No Eddie, hey.

229
00:43:26,073 --> 00:43:27,675
- Come on, go.

230
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,678
- What happened?

231
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:35,182
- Just leave.

232
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:39,220
He's fuckin' dead, man.

233
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,187
- Listen.

234
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:42,156
- Shit.

235
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:54,702
- Yeah, I
hear it.

236
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:56,036
- Over there.

237
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:11,352
Go, come on.

238
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:42,049
You're in a shit ton

239
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,951
of trouble now, bitch.

240
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:49,757
She's over here. I can smell
her.

241
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,259
Mm, I smell her, too.

242
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,066
Smells like trash.

243
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:02,269
Dirty, dirty trash.

244
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:10,444
Dirty...

245
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:13,781
Dirty girl.

246
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:21,388
Ain't no use hidin'.

247
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:22,423
Come on out.

248
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:08,536
Come out, dirty girl!

249
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:13,374
We know you're up here.

250
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:28,789
Come out, dirty girl.

251
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:58,352
Check that aisle over there.

252
00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,587
I got this one.

253
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:10,164
Hey!

254
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:17,338
Get your ass back here.

255
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:19,106
She's over here.

256
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,509
She's running!

257
00:47:21,543 --> 00:47:23,277
Don't let her get away!

258
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:25,580
- Yeah, I see her.

259
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,318
- She's getting
away, go!

260
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:36,357
Get her!

261
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:57,539
Hey, where'd she go?

262
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:59,039
- She's
hidin'.

263
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:00,474
Somewhere close.

264
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:03,243
- She can't get out.

265
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,647
The phone lines are cut and
the doors are chained shut.

266
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,749
Vic is keeping watch outside.

267
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:11,586
She's stuck in here.

268
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:13,020
Let's find her.

269
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:54,662
- Think.

270
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:55,563
Think.

271
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:03,163
- Hey.

272
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:16,376
- Give me those.
- Fuck.

273
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,311
- Hey Bobby, right here.

274
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:18,278
Right here.

275
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,380
- Hey sweetheart.

276
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:22,750
Come here!

277
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:35,697
Open the fuckin' door.

278
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:41,234
- Shit.

279
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:43,103
Shit.

280
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:25,647
- Fucker.

281
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:45,432
- Shit.

282
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:47,401
Oh, fuck.

283
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:06,406
- I
seen 'em come down this way.

284
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:17,484
Bi-itch!

285
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:29,730
Come out, come out, bitch!

286
00:59:21,762 --> 00:59:22,997
- I
heard somethin' up here.

287
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:25,366
- Shit.

288
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,041
What the fuck is this?

289
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:47,655
- Hey, you find
anything?

290
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:52,993
What is that?

291
00:59:53,027 --> 00:59:54,228
- Look at
this.

292
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:57,665
- Shit, that's
Bobby's iron.

293
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,703
- Is this
his blood?

294
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:08,075
- Check the
closets.

295
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:32,666
She's not fuckin' in here.

296
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,269
- Is she in
here?

297
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:38,339
- She's
close.

298
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:40,207
Maybe she doubled back around.

299
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:42,776
Anyone check the rough mill?

300
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,911
Bobby.

301
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,647
That fuck. Where the hell is he?

302
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:49,183
You think she got him?

303
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:51,385
That's a lot of fuckin' blood
over there.

304
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,221
Hey Vic, get down here.

305
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:59,727
Take the keys and go
check all the offices.

306
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,427
Thoroughly.

307
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:02,296
- I'm on it.

308
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:06,100
- Go head
down to the rough mill.

309
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,401
See if Bobby's still down there.

310
01:01:09,937 --> 01:01:11,138
When I find this bitch,

311
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,207
I'm gon' slit her fuckin'
throat.

312
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,298
- It's too fucking long.

313
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,121
- Oh!

314
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:43,223
Come here!

315
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,275
- Got ya!

316
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:03,685
Oh, we gonna play now.

317
01:08:03,718 --> 01:08:04,852
Get up!

318
01:08:06,854 --> 01:08:09,156
We gonna play real nice.

319
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:25,506
That's right.

320
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,275
Open up your mouth. Open up.

321
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:57,565
- What? No.

322
01:09:57,598 --> 01:09:58,633
No, no, no, no.

323
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:00,668
No.

324
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:14,015
- Karen!

325
01:10:29,664 --> 01:10:32,867
Come here.

326
01:10:36,804 --> 01:10:38,973
- Shit.

327
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:29,389
- Why'd you do this?

328
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:34,695
Danny. I know it's you.

329
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:37,698
Answer me.

330
01:11:46,674 --> 01:11:48,375
You won't get Lily

331
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:50,945
- Too late.

332
01:12:10,898 --> 01:12:13,668
Did you really think I
was gonna let you leave

333
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:15,570
and take my little girl from me?

334
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:19,406
Get used to it.

335
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:23,343
I'm gonna knock every single
tooth outta your fuckin' head.

336
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:29,650
This is what happens

337
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:31,953
when you try to pull
some bullshit like this.

338
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,422
You're not smart enough, Karen.

339
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:40,161
Look at me.

340
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:43,631
Look at me!

341
01:12:43,664 --> 01:12:46,067
You're so fucking stupid.

342
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:02,083
Don't pick that up.

343
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:05,953
You pick it up and I will
break your fucking hand again.

344
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:07,154
Come here.

345
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:09,724
You never fucking listen.

346
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:11,726
- No.

347
01:13:13,628 --> 01:13:15,930
- This is why
you are such a fuck up.

348
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,170
Give me the other hand.

349
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:26,540
- No.

350
01:13:34,181 --> 01:13:37,718
- Karen, you gonna listen this
time?

351
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:38,886
Give it to me.

352
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:46,493
- Please, Danny stop.

353
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:56,503
No, please.

354
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:01,976
No, stop.

355
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:04,477
Danny, please, stop.

356
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:05,513
No.

357
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:06,479
Danny, please.

358
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:11,686
- You turned on me.

359
01:14:12,853 --> 01:14:16,791
I gave you everything
and you turned on me.

360
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,020
- Mommy?

361
01:14:46,053 --> 01:14:47,722
- Lily?

362
01:14:47,755 --> 01:14:48,622
- Mommy?

363
01:14:51,325 --> 01:14:52,793
Mommy?

364
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:54,762
- Lily.

365
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:57,198
- Goddammit, I told
you to stay in the car.

366
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:58,132
- Lily!

367
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,600
- Mommy!

368
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:03,571
- Lily!

369
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:04,271
No.

370
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:16,917
- Mommy!

371
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:17,985
No!

372
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:19,220
- Lily!

373
01:15:27,228 --> 01:15:28,629
