00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,655
Kyle. Get over here.

352
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:45,790
Get up.

353
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:49,528
You've been pushing him
around again?

354
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:53,765
Milton, you know what to do.

355
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:55,133
Go on.

356
00:26:56,902 --> 00:26:58,336
Shake hands.

357
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:01,872
All good?

358
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,474
Go on.

359
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,581
What did I say to you
about slouching?

360
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,288
Easy on the spread,
it has to last a month.

361
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,223
[laughs] Mmm.

362
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:25,662
You know, your mother would turn
in her grave if she saw the world now.

363
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,630
This isn't the country
it once was.

364
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:32,401
Small miracles,
that's all we can hope for.

365
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:35,203
You know, every gang
in Long Beach is trying

366
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,172
to get their hands
on those kids.

367
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,541
We feed them,
get tutors for them.

368
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:41,510
This shelter,

369
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:43,544
it's a legacy.

370
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:48,316
As long as it stays open,
her memory will last.

371
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:51,886
Mom would be proud of you, Dad.

372
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,090
Yeah, well, pride isn't a luxury
I... I can afford, you know?

373
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:01,261
Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.

374
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,198
We've been defunded.

375
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,935
Yeah. Budget cuts,

376
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:10,869
that's what they say,
because of the riots last year.

377
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:13,974
The state doesn't get it,
you know?

378
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:16,241
Save a kid, you save the future.

379

[door closes]

380
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:23,016
Anyway,
I got to get to business.

381
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,450
Um, do you want me
to tell the kids

382
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,883
- the youth center's closed?
- No.

383
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,485
[clears throat] I invited them.

384
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:32,123
They're gonna help with
creative ways to keep the lights on.

385
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:39,663
Come on, buddy.

388
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:46,203
It's the opinion

00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:48,039
that why someone enters
law enforcement

390
00:28:48,171 --> 00:28:51,408
is as important as the work
they do on a daily basis.

391

Why do I wanna be a cop?

392
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,248

394
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,820
- Car chases.
- Okay, okay.

you're safe to go back on the streets

402
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,941
that's bottom line.

403
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,878
Look, I gave my statement.

404
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,747
It was a good shooting.

405
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,791

410
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:02,641
Now your father, he was
a bank manager in Newark.

a little bit about him?</i>

Dezi, take a seat.

420
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:57,993
I got a witness from
the Beston Bank robbery

421
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:01,595
that says you refused
to offer medical assistance.

422

Triage.

423
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,867
This isn't a war zone.

424
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:11,371
Would you rather me save
the villain or the victim?

425
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:12,839
I read your report.

426
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:15,407
Yes. We arrived
on the scene, right?

427
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,376
We went past the dead cop.

428
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,780
I made a judgment call, and then
we went into the manager's office.

429

00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:31,414
<i>Angel of Justice.</i>

524
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:34,551
[phone ringing]

525
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:43,025
[ringing continues]

526
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,363
Knight! My office, now.

527
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:54,570
Hey, boss. Shut up.

528
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:56,137
Yes, ma'am.

529
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,907
What are you working? Paperwork.

530
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,776
No thanks to you.

531
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:04,078
Good. Here's some more.

532
00:42:04,212 --> 00:42:06,781
Someone stole a uniform,
badge, gun...

533
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:08,816
The whole shebang...
From the coroner's office

534
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,717
down at North Roads Hospital.

535
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:12,853
Family wants the badge back.

536
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:15,055
IA wants the gun
and I want to know

537
00:42:15,188 --> 00:42:18,024
what kind of degenerate
would do such a thing.

538
00:42:18,158 --> 00:42:20,660
- No security cameras?
- Nope, no.

539
00:42:20,794 --> 00:42:22,763
Privacy reasons. Privacy?

540
00:42:22,896 --> 00:42:24,764
The customers are dead.

541
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,166
That means you're gonna have
to do a little leg work.

542
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:30,903
And by the looks of things, you could
do with getting in some more steps.

543
00:42:31,036 --> 00:42:32,171
Ouch.

544
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:34,306
Just calling it like I see it.

545
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,376
You sleeping all right?

546
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,477
Ah, thank you for noticing.

547
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:40,979
It was a late night.

548
00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:42,414
Narcotics Unit intercepted

549
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:45,450
a couple of tons of coke
and some women.

550
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,052
- Cartel shit?
- Oh, they wish.

551
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:49,788
No, it was the Vampos Gang.

552
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,356
I guess all the names
were... were taken.

553
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:57,928
Oh hey, congrats on the divorce.

554
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:01,765
I'm a free man. Yeah, well,
uh, your ring finger may be free,

555
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,334
but your ass still belongs
to the department.

556
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:06,469
Mmm.

557
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:09,472
Don't I know it.

558
00:43:10,072 --> 00:43:11,541
How's your daughter?

559
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:14,143
She's fine. Uh...

560
00:43:14,277 --> 00:43:16,979
Fine is not the F word
I would use

561
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:18,414
to describe your daughter.

562
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:21,783
But then again hey, I mean
she's got a dad like you

563
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,251
and a mom like Camilla.

564
00:43:23,886 --> 00:43:27,456
A shrink could diagnose those
daddy issues three states away.

565
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:29,758
Did somebody piss
in your coffee?

566
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:31,693
[chuckles] I'm just saying

567
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:35,963
that there's a way to balance
out work and home life.

568
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:39,767
How many husbands have you had? I
didn't say I knew how to balance it out.

569
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:42,169
I'm just saying there is a way.

570
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,071
You know, I mean look at Fitz.

571
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,539
Fitz is a good boy.

572
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:46,807
He's whipped.

573
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,175
That is true.

574
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:51,244
He's a good cop though.

575
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:52,979
What makes you say that?

576
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:54,882
There's none finer.

577
00:43:55,014 --> 00:43:56,716
No, I'm... I'm curious now.

578
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,920
What do you think makes
a good cop?

579
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:06,091
A good cop doesn't sleep well,
so everyone else can.

580
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,393
I'll accept that.

581
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:12,197
Oh, ah, one last thing.

582
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:14,233
You and Fitz are working
the Fourth.

583
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:16,568
I'm going camping.

584
00:44:16,702 --> 00:44:18,169
Camping?

585
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,972
Yeah. I got a cabin.

586
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:23,007
Uh, that's not camping.

587
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,276
Not unless I get time off.

588
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:27,111
The Fourth?

589
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,882
That's my favorite day.

590
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:31,983
And I expect you
to protect and serve

591
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:34,017
with a smile on your face.

592
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:36,553
Thank you, Knight.

593
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,341
[teller] Pensions are our specialty.
Your future is safe. I bank here.

594
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:03,278
Set up an account so we can get
you some nice compound interest

595
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,680
or maybe an investment account
would be better for you.

596
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:08,182
How much do you... Investment
account? Okay, that's fine.

597
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,953
Officer. What can I do for you?

598
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:13,588
[Dezi] I, uh... [groans]

599
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,159
Are you here to do a 6-8-9?

600
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:21,662
Yes. Yeah.

601
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:22,931
Miss Gakowski.

602
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,097
The officer... [groans]

603
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:26,166
...wants to do a 6-8-9.

604
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,203
Are you okay, Officer?

605
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:34,640
Your uniform looks
kind of wonky.

606
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:38,711
Call the union. The department
should not be sending you out like that.

607
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,115
Do I know you? Were you here
that night those tweaker assholes

608
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:45,584
made a run at my vault?

609
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:48,787
Yeah. I mean,
I... I heard about that.

610
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:52,257
[chuckles] My ass was almost
cooked, but you boys saved my life.

611
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,260
I'm sure those paramedics
did a good job, too.

612
00:45:56,661 --> 00:45:58,729
It was the blue bloods and
the doctors at Saint Mary's.

613
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:00,497
They're the heroes.

614
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:05,169
Are you part of the 14th?

615
00:46:07,005 --> 00:46:10,875
I have a guy whose father
used to be the night commander.

616
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:12,241
James Jayne?

617
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,310
Oh, yeah, sure.

618
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:15,778
You know him?

619
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:17,881
Yeah.

620
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:19,682
Good man.

621
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:21,051
I thought he died.

622
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:22,518
Well, you know...

623
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:25,320
cops never die.

624
00:46:27,356 --> 00:46:28,423
Amen, brother.

625
00:46:28,557 --> 00:46:30,359
Blue lives never die.

626
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:32,661
Thank you for what you do.

627
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:34,529
So, do you have any plans
for the Fourth?

628
00:46:34,663 --> 00:46:37,000
Ah, you know, uh, the usual.

629
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:39,301
Ah, yeah, work never ceases.

630
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:43,270
I can relate. I will
be here toiling away.

631
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:44,639
But I love it.

632
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:46,207
There's nothing more American

633
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,743
than making money on the Fourth.

634
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:59,386
[sighs] Jesus Christ.

635
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,354
Come on. Sir.

636
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,636
[hydraulics hum]

637
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:21,740
[manager] Have at it.

638
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:36,155
Yeah.

639
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:41,191
[father] <i>We've been defunded.</i>

640
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:44,227
<i>Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.</i>

641
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,732
Go, go, go.

642
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:53,469
[bandit 1] Everybody down! Down
on the ground! [customers screaming]

643
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,572
Get down! [customer] Oh, my God!

644
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,050
- You, back to the register right now!
- William, hang... hang on.

645
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:09,484
Let's go, let's go!

646
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:11,619
[bandits shouting]

647
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:17,759
Let's go! Empty the register!

648
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:27,234
[bandit 2] Fucking vault's
open. I'm going for it.

649
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:32,974
- [gunshots]
- [bandit 1 shouting]

650
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:34,208
Stay down!

651
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:36,576
[breathing heavily]

652
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,884
Let's go. Stay on the
ground. You, against the wall!

653
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:45,818
Get your head down!

654
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,820
Let's go.
Stay on the fucking ground!

655
00:48:49,956 --> 00:48:53,658
Shit! Ah! Fuck!
[bandit 3] You all right?

656
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:55,194
[bandit 1] I said no vault!

657
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:57,262
Look at all this fucking cash!

658
00:48:57,395 --> 00:48:58,630
I'm fucking shot, dude.

659
00:48:58,764 --> 00:49:00,565
Well, then hurry
the fuck up and help me.

660
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:02,868
[bandit 1] Fuck you! You
greedy fuck, get the money!

661
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,937
[bandit 2] You wanna fucking get out
of here, get the fucking money. Fuck!

662
00:49:16,446 --> 00:49:19,183
[bandit 3] Don't fucking
move. No cell phones, nothing.

663
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:21,986
Nobody move. I'll take
that. Thank you very much.

664
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:26,623
- [bandit 2] Fuck it. Let's go, you cry baby.
- [bandit 1] Goddamn it!

665
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:46,241
Damn. [customer screams]

666
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:47,675
[bandit 2] Stay down!

667
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:58,518
This shelter, it's a legacy.

668
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,423
As long as it stays open,
her memory will last.

669
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:08,095
All clear.

670
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:10,932
Good man.

671
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:13,532
[birds chirping]

672
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:25,644
[sighs]

673
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,319
Officer! Officer,
please, you have to help me!

674
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:35,154
You have to help me. Um...

675
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:36,688
You have to help me.
Please, my husband. He's...

676
00:50:36,822 --> 00:50:38,123
No, I'm not a, uh... Officer!

677
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:39,291
No, I'm off-duty.

678
00:50:39,724 --> 00:50:41,491
What? What kind of cop are you?

679
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,028
Okay, I need you to...
I need you to calm down.

680
00:50:44,162 --> 00:50:45,596
Huh?

681
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:48,565
Um...

682
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:52,337
Okay, look,
I need you to calm down.

683
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:53,704
Okay?

684
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,341
Where is he? He's over here.

685
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:58,842
Okay.

686
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:03,914
He's here. He's over here.

687
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,382
They're over there. Over here.

688
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:14,522
[husband groans]
[mugger 1] You're weak...

689
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,398
Hands up!

690
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:27,002
Yeah, hands!

691
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:32,007
[groans]

692
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,141
Go.

693
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:34,843
Get out of here!

694
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:37,511
Now, hands against the wall.

695
00:51:38,544 --> 00:51:40,147
Now!

696
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:46,020
All right.

697
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:47,154
Now, spread 'em.

698
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,524
All right,
now you all have the right

699
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,793
to remain silent.

700
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:55,929
[sighs]

701
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:57,462
And anything...

702
00:51:58,264 --> 00:51:59,498
What's this?

703
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,968
This? Huh?

704
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:03,635
[chuckles]

705
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:09,473
...you say
will be used against you

706
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:11,076
in the court of law. [grunts]

707
00:52:17,215 --> 00:52:20,918
- [mugger 2] That's it. Kick his ass.
- [mugger 3] Yeah, kick his ass.

708
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:23,453
[gunshot]

709
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:33,530
No.

710
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:35,631
No, no.

711
00:52:38,068 --> 00:52:40,769
Uh, all right.

712
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:42,105
Oh, no.

713
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:45,008
[breathing heavily]

714
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:49,477
This is what happens
when you do not show respect.

715
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,614
I am an officer of the law.

716
00:52:58,153 --> 00:52:59,554
Okay, get on your knees.

717
00:53:00,755 --> 00:53:02,590
Get on your knees
and kiss the ground!

718
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,158
Kiss the ground.

719
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:06,027
Kiss it!

720
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,528
Comply and you'll survive.

721
00:53:08,963 --> 00:53:09,998
Okay.

722
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:12,733
No.

723
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:22,209
I mean, answer me this.

724
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:26,246
You guys think the world
would be a better place

725
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,481
without you in it?

726
00:53:27,613 --> 00:53:28,849
Huh?

727
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:30,583
I mean, what do you do?

728
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:32,351
No, man. No. No.

729
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:35,054
[Dezi] Make this country
better than it was yesterday.

730
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,658
I got your answer right here.

731
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:46,231
[gunshots]

732
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:57,876
<i>If they had had complied,
they would have been alive.</i>

733
00:53:58,476 --> 00:54:01,278
[Dezi breathing heavily]

734
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,259
[knocking]

735
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,764
[knocking continues]

736
00:54:27,003 --> 00:54:28,304
Hello?

737
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:29,805
Who is it?

738
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:35,776
You won't believe
the day I fucking had.

739
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:38,113
What happened?

740
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:48,889
Some guy dressed up as a cop

741
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:50,925
shot four guys in Van Nuys.

742
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:52,827
Not one made it.

743
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,430
Did they find the shooter?

744
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,064
Not yet. But they will.

745
00:54:58,198 --> 00:55:00,066
I mean,
guy was dressed up as a cop

746
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,768
acting like
he was gonna arrest them.

747
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:05,238
The police don't know shit
about his motive.

748
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:06,605
Damn.

749
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:10,977
It isn't fair.

750
00:55:13,178 --> 00:55:15,780
Well, maybe it'll keep
the cops on their toes.

751
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:18,683
Shake things up a bit.

752
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:22,687
Don't say that, man.

753
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:25,257
Why?

754
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,692
Oh, you think they care
about us?

755
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,563
The sons pay for the
sins of their fathers.

756
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,132
Nothing's changed.

757
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:36,267
Okay?

758
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,402
My father taught me that.

759
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,037
I remember the day that I
told him I wanted to be a cop.

760
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,807
And he gave me the
biggest backhand of my life,

761
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,042
and knocked me down
on the floor.

762
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:48,445
[sighs]

763
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,982
Told me the cops
are our enemies.

764
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:56,218
And, uh, you know,
they're just pigs.

765
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:02,625
Descendants from slave owners
who prosecuted runaway slaves.

766
00:56:02,757 --> 00:56:06,262
Like the War of Independence,
uh, that's for this country's taxes

767
00:56:06,395 --> 00:56:09,631
and the American Civil War,
well, that's like,

768
00:56:09,763 --> 00:56:13,801
you know, they freed the
slaves, but no one's really free.

769
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:15,503
We're not free.

770
00:56:15,637 --> 00:56:17,605
We... We'll never be free.

771
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:23,776
Doesn't matter who we are, they'll sell
us the same fucking American dream.

772
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:27,281
And it's sad. It... It's so sad.

773
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:28,714
It's just...

774
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:30,217
It's about money.

775
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,786
And guys like,
what, Sean Beston?

776
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:37,223
<i>You know, he's... he's
just a... He's a slave owner.</i>

777
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:39,825
And the cops?

778
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:42,094
His goons.

779
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:45,164
I'm sorry you feel that way.

780
00:56:45,865 --> 00:56:47,099
Yeah.

781
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,202
It is what it is.

782
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:55,974
I... I thought I got over
this a long time ago.

783
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:04,950
See you.

784
00:57:14,892 --> 00:57:16,126
[sighs]

785
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:30,206
[horn honks]

786
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:51,225
[Kirill] Vinny,
where's the fucking money?

787
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:55,329
Who's this guy? Didn't
know he's a fucking cop.

788
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:00,368
No son of mine is a cop.

789
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:02,902
What the fuck you wearing, son?

790
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:06,640
It's not the uniform
that makes the man.

791
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:08,275
The man that makes his own luck.

792
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:11,244
Don't throw my fucking
words back in my face.

793
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:14,614
Halloween is next October.

794
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:16,116
You can dress up then.

795
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:18,183
You want to help?

796
00:58:18,984 --> 00:58:20,785
Start with meal prep.

797
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,354
Well...

798
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:25,524
we can change the world.

799
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:32,664
I mean, cops, they lock
up kids every day, but this?

800
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,132
This is real.

801
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:38,136
This shelter stops kids
from becoming these two.

802
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,338
This is our chance.

803
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:43,841
How long before the, uh...

804
00:58:43,975 --> 00:58:45,676
The lights go out
in this place for good?

805
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:48,278
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

806
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:50,180
I'm talking about real action.

807
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:53,984
You know? A real way
to make change.

808
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:57,120
Maybe your new associates
can help.

809
00:58:58,555 --> 00:58:59,588
Go on.

810
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:04,493
Beston Bank and Trust.

811
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:06,162
What about it?

812
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:10,833
Their security system,
it's all over the place.

813
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:12,501
The guards, they're arrogant.

814
00:59:12,635 --> 00:59:15,236
I... I can get us in.

815
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:16,905
So?

816
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:23,878
We hit it.

817
00:59:27,848 --> 00:59:29,049
When you look outside,

818
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:32,119
I mean, do you see
the American dream,

819
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:33,854
or do you see someone else's?

820
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:38,392
Embarrass the city
and make some cheese?

821
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,195
I can fuck with that.

822
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:51,237
We live in a society
where there is nothing

823
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,540
more American than making money

824
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:57,275
on the Fourth of July.

825
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:14,793
[Fitzgerald] Casey Rhodes
should be rotting in jail.

826
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:16,594
Could you be positive for once?

827
01:00:16,727 --> 01:00:19,730
Hey, I'm a fountain of
good vibes, brother Knight.

828
01:00:21,065 --> 01:00:26,102
If it isn't dumb and dumber.
Barney Rubble and this caveman.

829
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:27,570
What's his name again?

830
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:30,340
Can't believe you forgot
Fred's name.

831
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:35,412
Come on, we're on soft duty.

832
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,282
- That isn't real.
- Ah, soft duty is one beer above hard duty,

833
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:41,984
and three below "let's party."

834
01:00:42,117 --> 01:00:43,419
Fucking degenerates.

835
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:45,254
[Godwin]
One of you should be in jail,

836
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:47,122
and the other in the chair.

837
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:48,792
Have you got a problem?

838
01:00:48,924 --> 01:00:51,994
If I did, what would you do?

839
01:01:03,704 --> 01:01:04,807
Happy Fourth.

840
01:01:04,939 --> 01:01:05,874
Yeah.

841
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:08,442
Thank you, douche bags.

842
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:12,412
[groans]

843
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:13,580
Shit!

844
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:16,983
[sighs]
I'll meet you in the car.

845
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:29,462
[clears throat]
All right, let's do this.

846
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:31,163
You ready?

847
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,135
[sighs]
You lucky son of a bitch.

848
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:40,738
One time I'd rather
still be in the chair.

849
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,443
Hey!

850
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,512
You guys know you're going
to jail

851
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,013
for the rest
of your lives, right?

852
01:01:49,147 --> 01:01:50,647
Well, I...

853
01:01:52,884 --> 01:01:54,051
All right, I'm just playing.

854
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:56,086
All right, what do you got here?

855
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,688
What is that, a Roman candle?

856
01:01:58,155 --> 01:01:59,590
Let me see that thing.

857
01:01:59,723 --> 01:02:03,260
Listen, if you guys are
gonna light these off...

858
01:02:03,393 --> 01:02:06,162
[lighter flicks] ...you
gotta be safe about it.

859
01:02:06,662 --> 01:02:09,632
[fuse ignites] - Because you
could do some real damage

860
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:11,869
with one of these things.
You understand?

861
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:13,703
I want you to point 'em
in the air.

862
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:16,405
Not at people, not at
animals, not at dogs.

863
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:19,307
You understand? If I see
you pointing this at a dog,

864
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:21,978
I'm gonna curb stomp you
in front of your grandmother.

865
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,379
Do you understand?
All right, good.

866
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,416
[fireworks launching]

867
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:35,389
[cell phone buzzing]
[guests chattering]

868
01:02:36,892 --> 01:02:39,360
Oh. Mmm.

869
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:43,364
[guest] Whoo! Yes?

870
01:02:43,497 --> 01:02:45,533
[Knight] <i>Did you speak with her?</i>

871
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:48,268
[sighs] She will reach out
whenever she's ready to talk to you.

872
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:51,772
Just want to make sure
that she's okay.

873
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:53,540
<i>Just tell me where she's living.</i>

874
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:55,843
[chuckles]
She's got a boyfriend. I...

875
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:57,811
What? Who?

876
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:02,648
[chuckles] Oh, don't
go all super-dad now.

877
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:05,150
If not now, when?

878
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:07,020
How's the new guy?

879
01:03:07,486 --> 01:03:09,321
You don't get
to ask questions like that.

880
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,256
[Knight] <i>I'm just saying.</i>

881
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:15,027
You can do better.

882
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:18,763
<i>If he treats you right,
I'll support that.</i>

883
01:03:18,897 --> 01:03:25,636
All I want is for you and
our girl to be happy and safe.

884
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:28,573
That's all.

885
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:34,144
Do you think we, uh,
could have, uh, ever worked?

886
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:36,212
You put the job first.

887
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,916
And I'm not blaming you,
I'm not.

888
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:40,617
Just the hours.

889
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,086
It was no way to raise a family.

890
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:51,795
[chuckles] We were like, uh,
ships passing through the night.

891
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,063
Yeah.

892
01:03:53,562 --> 01:03:56,131
[chuckles] Yeah, we
were going for the same...

893
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,099
Yeah, the same iceberg.

894
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,869
<i>Hey, did you give her the bear?</i>

895
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,105
When I see her, I will.

896
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:06,842
Happy Fourth, Detective.

897
01:04:14,114 --> 01:04:15,817
Hey, honey. [Ally] Hi.

898
01:04:16,283 --> 01:04:19,252
[cell phone buzzing]

899
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:21,655
[scoffs]

900
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:24,792
Dad's been trying
to get a hold of you.

901
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:26,125
Why?

902
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:28,194
He's your father.

903
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:33,800
And fathers do care about
the well-being of their children.

904
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:35,836
Occasionally.

905
01:04:41,874 --> 01:04:43,809
He's sorry he missed
your birthday.

906
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:47,646
Yeah, and didn't he get me
this exact same one last year?

907
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,949
[chuckles]
You're his little princess.

908
01:04:50,082 --> 01:04:51,851
Whatever. [chuckles]

909
01:04:52,952 --> 01:04:54,485
Thank you.

910
01:05:04,228 --> 01:05:06,430
[clears throat] Okay. Oh.

911
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:08,966
You are your father's child.

912
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:11,367
Mm-hmm. You happy now?

913
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:13,336
Yeah, three more of those
and I will be.

914
01:05:13,469 --> 01:05:18,675
Mm-hmm. And nice
of you to dress up, too.

915
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:21,511
I'm on call.

916
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,648
Wanna do shots?

917
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,584
[chuckles] No.

918
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:32,387
These are Mike's work friends.

919
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:34,256
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

920
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,092
We wouldn't want
to embarrass him.

921
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:37,692
Mm-mmm.

922
01:05:41,797 --> 01:05:42,764
Okay.

923
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,734
To being a problem child.

924
01:05:46,868 --> 01:05:48,103
Oh, no.

925
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,805
To good parenting.

926
01:05:49,938 --> 01:05:51,304
[chuckles]

927
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,641
[grunts]

928
01:05:55,241 --> 01:05:56,710
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. Oh.

929
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:58,611
Oh. Why did you make me do that?

930
01:05:58,745 --> 01:06:00,081
That's so good. No.

931
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:01,548
Yeah. No.

932
01:06:01,949 --> 01:06:03,117
Go, Mom. Go, Mom.

933
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:04,484
Yeah! [chuckles]

934
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:52,661
[mouthing words]

935
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,367
Happy Fourth, Officer.
Happy Fourth.

936
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:00,436
- Indeed.
- What can I do for you?

937
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:03,105
I'm here to do a 6-8-9.

938
01:07:03,806 --> 01:07:05,607
Well, we've never been better.

939
01:07:06,175 --> 01:07:07,475
Well, I, um...

940
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:09,178
I'm just here
to check up on you, sir.

941
01:07:09,879 --> 01:07:12,614
Well, that's very kind of you.
But all is well. All is well.

942
01:07:12,747 --> 01:07:15,885
You'd be doing me a favor if you
let me inside, so I can see for myself.

943
01:07:16,018 --> 01:07:17,952
What are you doing? Oh,
you! Hey, there's two back there!

944
01:07:18,086 --> 01:07:20,255
- Fucker... [shouting]
- Want to let me inside?

945
01:07:20,387 --> 01:07:22,422
[Beston] Fucker! Stay back!

946
01:07:22,556 --> 01:07:24,558
Stay back, you motherfuckers!

947
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,162
[guard] Drop it, drop it.

948
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,495
[Beston] Get back!

949
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,265
[guard] Put your weapons down!

950
01:07:30,397 --> 01:07:31,965
[Beston] Back! Get...

951
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:33,466
Open it up.

952
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:36,069
Open up! Open it up!

953
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:48,747
I am about to live
my American dream.

954
01:07:50,515 --> 01:07:52,517
Mr. Beston,
please stay where you are.

955
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,487
Guards, put down your guns.
You're free to go.

956
01:08:07,899 --> 01:08:09,000
[Kirill] Fuck it!

957
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:10,969
[Beston yelps]

959
01:08:19,243 --> 01:08:20,911
You're fucking crazy.

960
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:23,379
[Dezi] Do you remember me?

961
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,648
Tell me who I am.

962
01:08:27,084 --> 01:08:29,052
<i>Tell me who I am.</i>

963
01:08:30,053 --> 01:08:31,888
<i>Tell me who I am!</i>

964
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,363
Still don't, huh?

01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,870

972
01:09:25,804 --> 01:09:28,539
Scared the little bastards.

973
01:09:30,175 --> 01:09:32,011
Too old for this shit.

Hey, boy scout, why don't
you take care of our new friend?

987
01:11:01,194 --> 01:11:02,627
Yeah, I just got
to the location now.

988
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:04,196

Christ, I'm having déjà vu.

saw three guys go in here.

Get the fuck down!
Down on the ground!

On the ground.
Don't fucking move.

Ally, Ally. You have to calm down.

1024

What do you mean?
What about her?
