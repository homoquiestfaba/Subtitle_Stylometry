1
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:17,307
Times like this remind me
of that classic Jay-Z tune.

2
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,564
It was all good just a week ago.

3
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,861
And how I get myself
here, I don't have a clue.

4
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,614
But I can say one thing

5
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,327
Love got me in his chair.

6
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,624
God damn, I hate
these hospitals.

7
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,751
The smell.

8
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,254
The cold ass air conditioning.

9
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,423
If I could turn back the
clock, I'd probably do

10
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,427
things a whole lot different.

11
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,181
But the damage is already done.

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,352
Demetrius Levine.

13
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,104
Oh.

14
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:07,107
And sometimes old mess pops up
on you at the least expected.

15
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,066
Oh, man.

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,028
So-- Sophie.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,279
Long time no see, huh.

18
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,163
Are you the husband?

19
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,000
It's a wide range of meaning
to that word called love.

20
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,753
But baby, I only
want you to kiss it.

21
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,881
Just a little kissy
kiss, that's it.

22
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,300
Do you know how pathetic
you sound right now?

23
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,467
Pathetic?

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,428
But I only want one wishy, babe.
Just one.

25
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,888
Just one.
Just one wishy-wishy.

26
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,973
Be quiet before they hear us.

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,433
OK.

28
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,728
I wishy your Black ass
would leave me alone

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,479
so I can focus on
getting ready and going

30
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,857
to work in the morning.

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,568
Everything is not
about sex, Demetrius

32
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,195
But sex is how we
got here, B. And I

33
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,781
don't want to have sex no
more, I've graduated to love.

34
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,908
I want to make
love to you, baby.

35
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,287
And I'm tired of going to bed
with hard dick every night.

36
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,497
It sucks, Demetrius.

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,666
Just one kiss.
Just kiss it.

38
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,500
Just one time.

39
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,334
This little kiss.

40
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,877
You don't give a
fuck about shit.

41
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,922
Not the boys, our family, our
future, none of that shit.

42
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,091
Like what's the fucking point?

43
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,801
I'm so tired of this shit.

44
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,054
Probably fuck my mom, too.

45
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,723
Because he's a community
dick, you know.

46
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,850
I was just fucking him
just to be doing something.

47
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,059
He got a lot of hoes.

48
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,728
And you see my fucking husband.

49
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,520
I got this ring.

50
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,738
Tell me it's my dick.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,697
It's yours, it's yours.

52
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,450
Oh, yeah.

53
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,910
Oh, right there.

54
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,245
Here now with the full forecast.

55
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,913
And Steve, not a complete wash.

56
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,039
Come on, boys.
Let's go.

57
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,415
There's plenty of people
out there enjoying this.

58
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,208
Yeah.
This--

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,251
I'm in front.

60
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,669
I'm in front.

61
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,213
Stop running, please.

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,383
Nobody's getting in front.

63
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,311
Here's my dick.

64
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,523
Here's my dick.

65
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,858
Tell--

66
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,651
Tell me.

67
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,152
I'm looking.

68
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:57,986
Oh, baby.

69
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,823
Fucking come.

70
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,033
I came already.

71
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,619
I came already.

72
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,662
I came already.

73
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:07,996
It's soft.
It's soft.

74
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,164
It's soft.
It's soft.

75
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,956
It's soft.

76
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,707
It's soft.

77
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,500
It's soft.

78
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,333
It's soft.

79
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,502
It's soft. it's soft.

80
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,545
OK.

81
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:15,504
No, you're not.

82
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,797
No, you're not.
It's soft.

83
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,589
It's soft.

84
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,215
It's-- Oh, OK.

85
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,592
OK.
It's back hard.

86
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,384
It's back hard.

87
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,218
It's back hard.

88
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,679
It's back-- OK, it's back hard.

89
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,513
It's back hard.

90
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,681
It's back hard.
OK.

91
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,515
OK.

92
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,307
OK.

93
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,938
This behavior was warranted.

94
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,731
She wasn't giving it to me.

95
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,735
So I had to get
it from somewhere.

96
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,699
Now who do you know suck
your dick like that?

97
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,578
I'm not used to make a man.

98
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,080
I wish you're going to do me.

99
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,709
I met Kelis at a local Family
Dollar on Cottage Grove.

100
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,169
She had a little trauma
like most women in my city,

101
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,338
but God damn.

102
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,091
It's common for a man to look
past the crazy in a woman just

103
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:01,967
to get to them cakes.

104
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,802
Ain't know what a bitch like.

105
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,805
Now would you hold
no crazy women?

106
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,056
He didn't have the best cakes.

107
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,187
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,022
Hey, yo, Mech, where you at?

109
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:22,863
I'm running late.

110
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,947
I'll be there.

111
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,156
Goddamn, man.

112
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,283
They say Thursday, Friday,
all have temperatures--

113
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,620
My name is Demetrius Levine.

114
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:32,998
Radio personality,
father, and lover man.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,958
Call me when you get
those master P tickets.

116
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,544
97.5 giving you
master P tickets.

117
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,879
is on air right now.

118
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,005
Can I take a message?

119
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,131
That's no problem.

120
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,926
Yeah, I have no
problem helping you.

121
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,516
I'm pretty sure that by now I
come across as a guy that can't

122
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,768
keep his dick in his pants.

123
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,187
But I beg to differ.

124
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,860
I'm going to take you
on a little journey

125
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,738
and we're going to explore
some relationships.

126
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,074
You'll see it play
out in real time.

127
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,471
Hey.

128
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,098
How do you even stick
to this shit, man?

129
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,519
I've been up since 5:00.

130
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,734
Who the hell she got
making all that damn noise.

131
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,913
Wow.

132
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,795
I know she's going to
kick my ass out now.

133
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,631
I come from a city where love
comes with a heavy price.

134
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,930
Single parenting is common.

135
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,311
Mom.

136
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,397
Mama.

137
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,442
Goddamn it, get the
fuck away from my door.

138
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,070
Man, you gonna loan
me that money or not?

139
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,907
Toxic is a term often used.

140
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,245
What am I going to
do with another baby?

141
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,664
35-year-old grandmothers
cling to the nightclubs and--

142
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,000
Ma.

143
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,459
Mom's best friend is
often her own daughter.

144
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,336
Ma.

145
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,725
Mothers cling on to their
sons like a second husband.

146
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,408
This fucking guy get
on my damn nerve, man.

147
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,078
It was worse when he was here.

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,553
Mama.

149
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,137
Mom.

150
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,807
And stepfather's
are never respected.

151
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,309
Girl, can't you see
your mom is sleeping?

152
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,187
And why are you knocking on that
goddamn door like you're crazy?

153
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,147
Ain't nobody talking to
your stinking ass, OK.

154
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,566
Like you done lost
your damn mind.

155
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,025
Oh, my God.

156
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:47,984
Damn.

157
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,153
Girl, what the fuck
do you want now?

158
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,447
I need you to watch Kayla
while I go to the doctor to--

159
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,240
No.
That's not going to happen.

160
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,867
I got to go see
about my link today.

161
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,619
You done spent all your
mother fucking link

162
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,245
and now we lacking
on food up in here.

163
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,747
No.
Not going to happen.

164
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,582
Ask your sister.

165
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,958
No.

166
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,085
But you know Michelle got to
go register for school today.

167
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,337
Well, shit, DJ,
I got a life too.

168
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,755
Fuck you mean?
No.

169
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,673
Not going to happen.

170
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,799
No.

171
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,594
Ma, it's important.

172
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,057
Girl, again?

173
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,391
I know.

174
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,518
Looking dumb as hell.

175
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,435
No.

176
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,604
Get up out of here
with that shit.

177
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,437
No.
Bye.

178
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,370
Let's go, man.
Come on.

179
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,663
We're going to be late.

180
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,789
It's show time, Det.

181
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,166
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:45,959

00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,843

00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,100

00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,018

And somebody's going to
leave with a record deal.

201
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:27,918
That's right.

202
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,252
OK, bitch, I'm done.
You like?

203
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,087

to perform his/her heart singly.

205

00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,092
I said singly-- a.k.a.

207
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,594

219
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,154
That's that motherfucker that
slept with my sister, man.

220
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,991
That's my boy, Mitch
Levine, raw dog king, woo.

221
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,076
He got big headed.

222
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,703
I used to let the nigger
use my car and shit

223
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,538

bloomer panties in my shit.

224
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,122
Bitch, it might been
big booty Keesha

225
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,332
is the one that go through it.

226
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,125
Nigga fucking
everybody nigga mom.

227
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,002
Probably fuck my mama shit.

228
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:11,837
Everybody.

229
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,046
I heard he slept
with you sister.

230
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:13,880
Damn.

231
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,298
Ain't you gonna talk about that?

232
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,382
That's community dick.

233
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,093
When I see him, I'm
gonna crush his ass.

234
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,344
Come to find out he's engaged.

235
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,512
Is he?

236
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,056
Yeah, he's got a whole
bitch at home and kids.

237
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,017
Speaking of single, if you're
that self-proclaimed bad bitch,

238
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,478
then why are you single?

239
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,313
I'm interested to know
your thoughts at 59--

240
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,529
That's why it's barking.

241
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,739
If I couldn't talk--

242
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,824
This is my little cousin, Lady.

243
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,867
And you know--

244
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:42,951
I took her under to
my wing sometimes.

245
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,122
She saw her mom get murdered
by her father some years ago.

246
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,500
So our grandparents decided
to take over and raise her.

247
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,710
There's no reason the woman
should still be grieving.

248
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,670
Grandma's kind of
senile now so--

249
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,297
She doesn't need
special prayer anymore.

250
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,132
And grandpa--

251
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,634
I tell you.

252
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:01,469
--he got some demons of his own.

253
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,347
Because these boys run
around and the pants just

254
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,807
sagging, just sagging.

255
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,351
Well if they don't sell
belts, just get a small--

256
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,311
We're going all the way
downtown on the station

257
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:17,443
that brings you word from
the street that's 97.5 Rock.

258
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,487
Oh Boston say you like the 807.

259
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,781
Man.

260
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:21,740
Why you say that?

261
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,074
Man, because you late.

262
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,368
You can't just march in here
like you own the place, man.

263
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,996
You're going to be a Galaxy
7, burnt all the way up, boy.

264
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,665
I'm trying to tell him, man.
Keep on.

265
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,750
Can't get new girl, all
that type of power to--

266
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,126
Mech.

267
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,838
Mechy Mech, my little
chocolate chip tribe.

268
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,006

00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,675

I see the way you look at me.

Do you understand me?

280
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,570
That's a deep

281
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,071

Shut your ass up.

286
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,536
Ain't nobody talking to you.

287
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,954
You ain't got shit
to do with shit.

288
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,080
Shut your ass up, nigga.

289
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,372
Shut your ass up.

290
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,500

Yo.

302
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,570
Don't you ever have me

Who are you slapping

She really slapped

What are you going

Then she walked up out of here
and told you got the number.

310
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,175
Slapped the shit out you.

311

00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,449
So what the fuck was you at?

327
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,242
At the studio.

00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,076
Yeah, you know--

329
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,120

It went a little bit
longer than I expected it.

334
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,920
They were shooting.

335
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,005
They were shooting, a
shooting on 79th, baby.

336
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,757
I'm like-- I can't make this up.

337
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,841
OK.

338
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:45,634
Yeah.

00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,927
Three-- three dead bodies.

00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:47,761
Three.

341
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,220
Three-- three dead bodies.

00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,180
You're so full of shit.

00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,832
You can't win for losing, yo.

361
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,916
You gonna stay in trouble.

362
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,585
Your new name is Trouble.

363
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,675
Now, you know your pull out
game weak as hell, right?

364
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,510
Man, ain't nobody trying
to hear that shit.

365
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,886
What you mean?

366
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,180
And your ass better not leave
me like my last baby daddy did.

367
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,850
Ain't nobody gonna leave, man.

368
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,018
Now I know my OG finna kick
me out now, definitely.

369
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,811
So?

370
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,104
You just come stay with me.

371
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,231
And how long you think
that's going to last, goofy?

372
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,023
As long as I say.

373
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,274
Fuck is you talking about?

374
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,527
My mama don't do nothing
but run her fuckin mouth.

375
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,737
Boy.

376
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:49,489
She want a grandbaby, and
your mama should, too.

377
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,033
Oh I can't do-- what I'm going
to do with another kid, Tosh?

378
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,037
Take care of him, like
a mother's supposed to.

379
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,248
Yo ass tweaking.
You acting like--

380
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,290
Nah, you tweaking.

381
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,416
You acting like you ain't--

382
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,918
like you ain't going
to have no help

383
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,419
or nothing, like I
ain't going to be

384
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,589
here for you and the baby.

385
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,423
I'm not saying that, Tosh.

386
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,842
Then what you saying, then?

387
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,219
I got two kids and I'm 17, Tosh.

388
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,012
So?

389
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,055
We ain't got no job, Tosh.

390
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,140
So?

391
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,268
We going to make it happen.

392
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,061
OK.

393
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,187
All right.

394
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,606
You got it all figured out.

395
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,899
You got it all planned out.

396
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,901
So I'm-- I'm going
to listen to you.

397
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,277
OK.

398
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:31,239
One thing I learned about
the most beautiful women,

399
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,366
they seem to have the
biggest insecurities.

400
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,952
So we're going to get
up this weekend, right?

401
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:36,995
Nah.

402
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,122
I got to promote for
my company that day.

403
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,291
Well I did have a good time.

404
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,250
Food was good.

405
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,043
Of course.

406
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,460
Scree.

407
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,595
That boy going to be honking
his horn at any minute.

408
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:56,306
Do something to them eyelashes.

409
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,684
You ugly.

410
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,977
Baby, you got good genes.

411
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,730
You got hips like your
mama and a ass to match.

412
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,607
Where in the hell did
I get this forehead?

413
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,611
Ain't no nigger worried
about no damn forehead.

414
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,404
Here.

415
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,323
That boy going to be honking
his horn at any minute.

416
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,951
Just decided I'm gonna do
the same thing with the eyes.

417
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:20,914
Well, Fi, niggas gonna be
niggas, some good and some bad.

418
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,417
They say a mother's
knows best, but sometimes

419
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,878
that motherly advice
can lead a young woman

420
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,255
down a whole road of pain.

421
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,257
Now see, he was a good guy.

422
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,720
He bought you gifts, got your
name tattooed on his neck.

423
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:38,348
Shit, he even tried to propose
to you, and you was only 17.

424
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,433
He was a bug.

425
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:44,104
And Marvin, the football
player that moved his mama

426
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,607
off the block and became pro?

427
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:49,234
Damn, Fi, you should
have kept that man.

428
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,527
He was abusive.

429
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,529
What about Cary?

430
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,573
Cary?

431
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,158
Cary that tried to pop
everybody's cherry?

432
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,954
Well baby, who said niggas
don't have killer sex drives?

433
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,916
But mom, sex with me
just wasn't enough.

434
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,127
Fi, did you even
fuck that nigga dick?

435
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,461
Ma!

436
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,009
You gonna learn
how to keep a man.

437
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:15,929
And I'm sure you know how.

438
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:18,348
Coming.

439
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,644
I'm just getting tired of
going through the same thing

440
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:24,520
with guys.

441
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:25,856
I always get the bad ones.

442
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,482
Left front

443
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,942
door.

444
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,903
Hey, Pastor.

445
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,571
Hi.

446
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,406
Sister Bradley, it's
a pleasure seeing

447
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,827
your face gleaming in the
sunshine God has given us.

448
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,254
Our annual singles event is
this Saturday at the church.

449
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,923
We'll be discussing
ways of placing

450
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,258
God first in our relationships.

451
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,387
It'd be nice to have
you in attendance.

452
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,722
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,683
But Saturdays is
endless chicken wings

454
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:04,643
and karaoke night at Venus.

455
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,937
Me and my homegirls plan
on getting lit with them

456
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,147
$3 shots of tequila.

457
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,651
I don't have time
for church, Pastor.

458
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,820
That thot activity will
leave you in a state

459
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,655
of loneliness and misery.

460
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:20,534
So check yourself before
you wreck yourself.

461
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,452
Mech.

462
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,704
Yeah, boss.

463
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:25,914
God dammit, Mech, how many
times I gotta tell you you

464
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,834
can't say bitch on the radio?

465
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:29,793
You piece of shit.

466
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,545
Look, look, I'm sorry, boss.

467
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,714
But look, it's commonly
used in media nowadays,

468
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:34,923
like ass and titties, right?

469
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:35,716
It is, boss.

470
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:36,800
It is.

471
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,343
If the FCC shut us
down, it's going to be

472
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,386
your ass and a tough titty.

473
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,973
For you trying to work in the
broadcasting industry anyway,

474
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,099
you piece of shit.

475
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,351
And the music selection
is R&B in the morning,

476
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:51,272
hip hop at night, not that la di
da di, every hour on the hour.

477
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,442
You heard what I said.

478
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,951
One thing about my fiancee, she
ain't never hold no punches.

479
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,376
Babe, just give me one
second to explain, please.

480
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,920
You left condoms and a
hotel key in your pocket,

481
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,506
you son of a bitch.

482
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:16,757
I ain't even use them condoms.

483
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,884
How you gonna trip on some
condoms I didn't even use?

484
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:19,676
That's even worse.

485
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:20,594
Really?

486
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,929
Hey man.

487
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,305
How in the fuck--

488
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,099
But you can't change
the locks on the doors

489
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,893
and keep me away
from my kids, Bianca.

490
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,603
Don't do this shit
in front of the kids.

491
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,772
You got receipts from
Edible Arrangements,

492
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:34,941
chocolate covered strawberries,
flowers, and shit.

493
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,484
You freaky, motherfucker.

494
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,986
I don't give a fuck about this--

495
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:38,820
Hey, Bianca--

496
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,738
--this game.

497
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,489
Don't throw my PS2
out the window.

498
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,949
Ah!

499
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,284
Ah!

500
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,326
God damn it!

501
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,996
Fuck you and that old ass game.

502
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,831
You cheating on my
sister, bitch ass nigga?

503
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,874
What's up?
I ain't scared of you bitches.

504
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,458
I ain't scared of
none of you bitches.

505
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,960
We'll fuck your ass up.
Come on.

506
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,712
Don't let him do you like that.

507
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,339
Bob and weave, man.

508
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,929
Bob and weave.

509
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,810
Bitch, why should
I be complaining?

510
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,604
My account's straight,
my bills paid.

511
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,774
I ain't got no room to
be dry end or stressed.

512
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,152
You can miss me with that one.

513
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,575
He is when he with me,
so what else matters?

514
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,955
And it's always the
bitch with no nigger

515
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,790
giving all the advice.

516
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:35,877
For your information, me and
Mech working on something.

517
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,088
Ain't nobody studying Bianca.

518
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,176
She been wearing that same
engagement ring for four years,

519
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:46,555
Whatever.

520
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,473
Yeah.

521
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,433
All right, all right,
Wendy Williams, with all

522
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,436
the relationship advice.

523
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,188
All right.

524
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,898
Bye, hater.

525
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,775
That's no excuse.

526
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,486
But I know you
deserve the truth.

527
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,698
And all that you ever
need, the things you need,

528
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,367
I can no longer give.

529
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,493
Hey, daddy.

530
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,287
Hey.

531
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,332
What happened to your face?

532
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,960
Can't talk about it right now,
I'm just going hear about it.

533
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:20,005
Oh my baby, pookie boo,
who you been fighting?

534
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,258
Look, have a seat, Khalees.

535
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,968
I'm just not ready.

536
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,262
What's really going on?

537
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,973
What's really going on?

538
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:33,644
There's a whole lot of
shit going on right now.

539
00:22:33,646 --> 00:22:35,771
It's my job.

540
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:36,938
On the radio?

541
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,483
Yeah, on the radio.

542
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:44,362
And Bianca man, she--

543
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,489
Bianca done found out
about me fucking around,

544
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:50,243
and Dean has my kids, and--

545
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,079
and everything fucked
up right now, man.

546
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,624
So that's what you call it?

547
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,250
Fucking around?

548
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,084
No.

549
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,753
Look, Khalees look, Khalees--

550
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,129
Khalees, that
ain't what I meant.

551
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:01,922
Come here.

552
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,298
Come here Let me talk--

553
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,636
Khalees, Look, look,
that's not what I meant.

554
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,095
Look, we just got
to put everything

555
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,806
on pause for a minute.

556
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,935
That don't take nothing
away from what we got.

557
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:19,272
I mean, you a cool ass chick,
you make a nigga feel alive.

558
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,900
Khalees knew she had me at go.

559
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,152
But that's what good
pussy do to you.

560
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,907
It sometimes make you forget
about what you got at home.

561
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:34,120
Just looking at those roses
wrapped in $100 bills,

562
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,165
she knew she had me.

563
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,546
It's OK.

564
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:46,009
With our communication,
there's no understanding.

565
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:54,015
Plus, I'm a big girl.

566
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,520
I knew what I was getting myself
into when we first started.

567
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,941
Plus, you're a good nigga,
all concerned with taking

568
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:06,194
care of your family and shit.

569
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,446
And I respect that.

570
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,702
But you know, Mech,
I'll lean back.

571
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,248
Don't leave me high and dry.

572
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,585
Make out with me one more time.

573
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,342
Can we do that?

574
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,137
Please?

575
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:34,683
Yeah.

576
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:53,700
Khaleesi, know it's
a thing related.

577
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:57,579
All of that potential, when it
came down to getting on stage,

578
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,081
she would freeze up.

579
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:04,961
Her demons-- her demons
brought about the anxiety.

580
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:09,800
And sometimes she would take
too many trips down memory lane.

581
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:12,844
And for some people
going down memory lane,

582
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,180
it's like falling
down a dark hole.

583
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:22,145
My nut on over time.

585
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,690
Is my daddy really going to
bring my Christmas present

586
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:25,483
this time?

587
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,779
Yes, baby.

588
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,199
Your daddy going to give
you the best Christmas ever.

589
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,337
Ha.

590
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,089
Shut the fuck up.

591
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,841
Hey!

592
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,218
Hey, fuck you, man.

593
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,011
Fuck you.

594
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,599
Because you not
living in the park.

595
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:01,852
I'm living in the park.

596
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,690
Like-- Whoa.

597
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,038
Merry Christmas, baby--

598
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,414
And nothing.

599
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,335
--you sure do treat me right.

600
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,673
What's wrong?

601
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,721
You no good nigga.

602
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,515
How do you come
here empty handed?

603
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,850
You promised her.

604
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,520
I love my baby.

605
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:45,436
I do for her.

606
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,229
When?

607
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,357
I'm here ain't I?

608
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,859
Let me go.

609
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,819
You're going to wake her up.

610
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,863
Look, I'm your baby daddy.

611
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,073
Quit tripping on this
white man holiday.

612
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,159
But you promised my baby gifts.

613
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,744
I'm gonna go get the gifts.

614
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,580
But what about mine?

615
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:07,083
Stop.

616
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:23,746
Beast in the studio.

617
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,986
Dr. call 4-9-9.

618
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:03,074
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Alicia.

619
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:07,704
Hey, Doc, so what's the results?

620
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,290
Ms. Burns, what
you've contracted

621
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,502
is sexually transmitted.

622
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,295
Please.

623
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:19,633
Are you aware of with whom
you may have slept with?

624
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:24,763
Within the last
six months, maybe.

625
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,224
This is not a fatal disorder,
but you may experience

626
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,770
occasional complications.

627
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:35,774
And looking at the
severity of both diseases--

628
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:41,362
Wait, both diseases?

629
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,076
--you may be prohibited
from producing a pregnancy.

630
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:52,708
We have extreme medications
to control the virus.

631
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,003
Unless some miracle happens,
you'll have to take these meds

632
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,089
for the rest of your life.

633
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,299
There's a lot of
Alicias out there

634
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:05,386
in every community
across America, sometimes

635
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:08,724
you just don't
know who they are.

636
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:13,854
Behind pretty face, it
might be a dark case.

637
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:14,648
Alicia?

638
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,901
Alicia?

639
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,820
Girl is you in here?

640
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,154
Yeah, I'm coming out.

641
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,573
What's up?

642
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:27,117
Girl boss man
wanna holler at us.

643
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,494
Girl, everybody, girl, come on.

644
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,540
OK, I'm coming right out.

645
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,455
Numbers are in.

646
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,542
We offer the hottest
entertainment

647
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,251
service around town.

648
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:22,756
But I cannot, I repeat,
I cannot have you

649
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:25,091
hoes selling ass on the clock.

650
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:29,596
Champagne room, lap
dance, only, ass shaking,

651
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:33,141
hips twerking, this
ain't no bunny ranch.

652
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:36,269
You hoes wanna sell
ass, move to Vegas.

653
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,773
Damn, Crisco, why are
you knocking the hustle?

654
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:43,109
"Knocking the hustle," let's
keep the feds from knocking

655
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,987
at my fucking door, and keep
me from knocking you upside

656
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,364
your motherfucking head.

657
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:52,118
No sex in the champagne
room, understand?

658
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,038
Nigga, I already got
the city officials

659
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,333
breathing down my throat,
just looking for a reason

660
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,876
to try take my liquor license.

661
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,252
And guess what?

662
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,839
No club, no money.

663
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:05,882
No money, no club.

664
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,011
No money-- ooh.

665
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:13,056
You bitches get to see the
real reason why they call

666
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,475
me Crisco in the first place.

667
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:21,565
Hey mommy, mommy, why
do you call him Crisco?

668
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,650
Girl, cause he
keeps you popping.

669
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,361
God damn right.

670
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,279
12:00 just like I expected.

671
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:31,950
We got tricks coming in,
took off on their last break.

672
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,326
Let's hustle, bitches, get it.

673
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,620
Skit, scat, skit.

674
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:35,411
Go, go, go.

675
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,206
Money, money, money.

676
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:43,920
Alicia, Alicia, girl I need to
talk to you, urgent, urgent.

677
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,881
Let me ask you a question.

678
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:49,676
How come I got your people
coming to my establishment

679
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,803
looking for your ass?

680
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:54,556
Claims filed a
missing person report.

681
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,600
This seem more fucked up.

682
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:59,269
Your mother claimed you totally
abandoned your daughter.

683
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,898
You left her with no food.

684
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,275
Chris, look, I can explain.

685
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,612
That's bullshit!

686
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,405
I ain't no social worker.

687
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,991
Don't be bringing your personal
problems to my establishment.

688
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,785
Now, if there's
by any chance you

689
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,662
need to make some
extra money, you can

690
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,496
work some of the late nights.

691
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:22,959
I got a comedy show coming up
this Tuesday, a huge hip hop

692
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,335
concert coming this weekend.

693
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,797
There's going to be some real
ass record artists

694
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,256
in the building.

695
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:31,593
I could use some real ass
help, one more on the team,

696
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:36,472
has to trust me.

697
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,933
What the fuck is that?

698
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,350
You tell me.

699
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,020
Boss said he found while
cleaning your work area.

700
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,188
Yeah.

701
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,607
Now you know this the
type of shit that get you

702
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,317
kicked the fuck up out of here.

703
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,028
Now I like your nature.

704
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,072
You's a bad bitch.

705
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,407
But you know, what
you need to do

706
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,660
is stop bringing your ass
to work high all the god

707
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,161
damn time.

708
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,329
Now go home.

709
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,122
And take care of
your priorities.

710
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:03,208
And take care of your toy.

711
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,586
And bring some decent clients
here, little

712
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:07,462
motherfucking bill paid.

713
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,214
I can do that.
I'll have a talk with you.

714
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:10,173
Thanks, Crisco.

715
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:14,928
Alicia, oh, Alicia,
girl, we need

716
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,930
to get you some cornbread
cobbler up in here.

717
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,515
Your ass shrinking up.

718
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,558
Whatever.

719
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,403
They say if you want to
bring change out of a man,

720
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:35,198
you got to start
with his appearance,

721
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,368
so fresh and so clean.

722
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,081
For me, that change
came with a haircut.

723
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,668
97.5 is my life.

724
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,003
Just feel the energy.

725
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:52,132
Man, I got this new look, swag
was on 1,000, and the guys,

726
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:55,012
oh man, they really made me
feel like I made the right move.

727
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,015
This was my
transformation right here.

728
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:03,101
This was my time to
clean up and show Bianca

729
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,561
that I could be a better man.

730
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:08,189
But first it started with
me, my look, my appearance.

731
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:10,025
So yeah, let's see
how this worked out.

732
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,359
How we do.

733
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,904
Ooh can you feel the heat?

734
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:18,534
I'm sort of feeling
groovy, champagne cooler,

735
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:20,451
it's about to be a movie.

736
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,580
You are now looking at the
most elite radio station

737
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:24,748
in the Midwest.

738
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,626
97.5 R-O-C-K Radio,
y'all listen.

739
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:28,459
We got tributes.

740
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,795
We got this wacky weather, man.

741
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:31,421
We got a contest
coming up, who's

742
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,882
the best between Sir Mix-A-Lot,
and DaBaby, YoungBoy.

00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,217

744
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:37,928

00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:42,974
97.5 on your FM dial,

00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,269
Bringing you the hottest hip
hop and R&B, coming all the way

748
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:49,230
live from the South
Side of Chicago.

749
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,984
Yeah, yeah y'all know the
South Side is the best side.

750
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:53,777
The best--

751
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:54,945
South Side is what's up.

752
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,656
79th Street, 54th, 35th, 22nd--

753
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,118
Hey man, wake your ass up.

754
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,829
Ain't nobody pay you
to sleep up in here.

755
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:04,830
Sleep in a hotel.

756
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:05,622
All right.

757
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,497
Good morning, ladies--

758
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,749
97.5 on your FM dial.

759
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,459
--looking real
nice in that dress.

760
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,837
The host to the
show, hit the club,

761
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,422
coming from Paramount
Records out of Los Angeles,

762
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,843
and they're looking for the
hottest rap artists coming

763
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,344
out of Chicago, all right?

764
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:22,347
So ladies, call in and get
your free tickets, all right?

765
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,349
And ladies, I have
a question for you.

766
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:28,436
If you are a self-proclaimed bad
bitch, then why are you single?

767
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,856
My boss man's brother took
over the radio station.

768
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:34,317
I told your ass about cussing
on this radio station.

769
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,986
Man I was on the South Side.

770
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:36,903
Macy.

771
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,196
You fucking.

772
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,531
Macy.

773
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,950
He always tried to keep a foot
up my ass for some reason.

774
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,828
What the fuck I tell you about
saying bitch on the radio?

775
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,247
Boss, you know, you know,
bitch, it's commonly

776
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,750
used in in radio and TV, right?

777
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,126
No, it is, boss.

778
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,377
I don't give a fuck.

779
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,005
If the FCC get hold of this
shit and shut us down--

780
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:55,922
It's just a word, boss.

781
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,215
Shut the fuck up.

782
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,050
You ain't going to find no
goddamn work in broadcast,

783
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,928
because Bobby Fam, own
what's now your brother.

784
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,846
Sorry about that.

785
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,347
We won't do it again, boss.

786
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,057
I'm the only motherfucker
say bitch here.

787
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,934
Shut the fuck up, do
your own god damn jobs.

788
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,019
I'm encouraging, boss.

789
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,103
Yeah.
Yeah.

790
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,522
You want to look
out for your ass,

791
00:37:11,524 --> 00:37:14,065
you won't be looking out in
Walmart and some motherfucking

792
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,360
where, picking up boxes.

793
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:21,573
97.5 FM, we'll be
slowing it down today

794
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,743
with some nice, smooth songs
from side A. All right.

795
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:29,956
Chaka Khan, we also got some
Bobby Womack coming your way.

796
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,168
You listening to the hottest
hip hop and R&B, that's 97.5 FM.

797
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,587
And after Star Search this
Saturday night, hey fam,

798
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,005
get us spinning on wax.

799
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,465
Bam, you might want to put
on some Womack and Womack,

800
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,051
and some Isley
brothers, or your ass

801
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:44,304
be doing karaoke at C. Sizzle.

802
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,140
All right, man, but
I'm glad we did.

803
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,517
You think you're lonely now?

804
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,935
Wait till tonight.

805
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,062
He's in, and he is truly good.

806
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,396
Amen.

807
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,190
Listen, do me a favor, if
you have your phone with you,

808
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:56,357
and you want to.

809
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,483
That's true.
Yes.

810
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:58,359
Somebody say patient.

811
00:37:58,361 --> 00:37:59,152
Patient.

812
00:37:59,154 --> 00:37:59,945
Say patience.

813
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:01,279
Patience.

814
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:05,075
So you are a patient in life,
you have to have patience.

815
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:07,578
Bianca spends a lot of
time in the House of God,

816
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,538
especially since the breakup.

817
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,208
Seems like she's
trying to find herself.

818
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:27,639
Every Christian household
got its dos and don'ts.

819
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,810
And Lady has been under
a strict upbringing.

820
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,272
Sit.

821
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:47,117
"I'm a boss bitch with
nice ass and soft tits."

822
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,328
Oh Lord, Jessica!

823
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:54,249
I hawk spit on any
MC that talk shit.

824
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,375
Honey, we're Christians.

825
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,793
We don't spit on people.

826
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,169
But it's only rhymes.

827
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:01,923
And the notebook was
tucked away in my room.

828
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,759
I forbid this form of
literature to dwell

829
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,343
within the walls of this house.

830
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,638
Life and death are
in the power of the--

831
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,016
But it's only music.

832
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:29,535
Deacon Levine.

833
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:30,661
Mech.

834
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:33,872
Don't nothing come to
a sleeper but a dream.

835
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:36,833
How that poly been holding
up for you, player?

836
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:39,087
A lot better than your
pants right now, young man.

837
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:42,923
A lot better.

838
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,926
Your ditches, man.

839
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:47,638
Now what you do to
piss off the Deacon?

840
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:52,558
Huh?

841
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,519
Bet mama Levine in there
still talking off the wall,

842
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,646
too, ain't she?

843
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,732
Jessie, life is like
a box of chocolates.

844
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:04,444
Jessie, why does that girlfriend
of yours look like a boy?

845
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,279
Is that a man or woman?

846
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,155
Stop.

847
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,741
You know she got her disorder.

848
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:13,078
I know, I love mama, but damn.

849
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,831
Ain't
no kids at this party.

850
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,457
Both of us can do our thing.

851
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,875
Are y'all with me?

852
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,377
Turn it one time.

853
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,547
It's like you know he went
rambling through my stuff

854
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,340
and found my rhymes.

855
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,133
Ah, shit.

856
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,677
I bet he blamed it on me, too.

857
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,095
I bet he did.

858
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,847
Basically.

859
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:35,601
But now I gotta move out, or
maybe I can come stay with you

860
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:36,560
for a couple of months.

861
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,729
Oh, hell no.

862
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:41,189
You and Bianca do not get along.

863
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:42,524
Y'all don't mix.
Uh-uh.

864
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:43,567
No.

865
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,359
Fuck that bitch.

866
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:45,652
I'm your family.

867
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,864
Come on, that's my
baby mama, girl.

868
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,365
That's my BM.

869
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,701
Now what I will do, is give
you a little money so you

870
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:54,953
can go and get your own joint.

871
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,037
Yeah.

872
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,998
But then again, you
ain't got no job,

873
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,501
so you can't pay the bills.

874
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:03,003
I hope you see the importance
now of doing these shows, man,

875
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,046
putting this work out here.

876
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:07,090
Because I can't hold you.

877
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:07,885
Oh no.

878
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:15,140
Cheryl, these niggas
getting them..

879
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,518
Charisma, oh my god.

880
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,269
What are you doing?

881
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,730
And how did you
get my lip gloss?

882
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:24,775
Come on, child, let's
take some selfies.

883
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:27,277
There's going to be 1,000 likes.

884
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:30,446
So I'm thinking
I can wear denim,

885
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:34,325
bunch of holes in
my jeans, a leather

886
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,578
jacket, a vest or something.

887
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,329
Damn, the 'gram busting.

888
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,165
Hello.

889
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,709
Can you get pussy off your
mind for one damn minute?

890
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,003
No, I'm sorry Lady, she
thick as hell, look.

891
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,922
Look at that.

892
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:49,132
Look at my grand buddy.

893
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,050
Oh.

894
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:50,884
Yeah.

895
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,678
I'm about to hit her up.

896
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,429
So she ain't gonna
keep playing--

897
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,471
Like my hair, mom?

898
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:56,264
Yes.

899
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,724
Girl, yes.

900
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,017
Where'd you get it?

901
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,686
This Peruvian, girl.

902
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,478
Girl, bye.

903
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,107
And this is Troy, a hard
working man that probably don't

904
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,360
get enough respect at home.

905
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:13,448
They say you can't
tame a wild horse.

906
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,619
And this lady, she's
definitely a wild horse.

907
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,083
Baby, I thought you weren't
getting off til three.

908
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:25,251
Yeah, and I thought my
daughter would be at daycare,

909
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:27,754
and yo ass on an interview.

910
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:32,926
But I see though, once again you
ass up on Instagram promoting

911
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:34,595
shit with her wearing
makeup, like she's

912
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:35,554
some hoe or something.

913
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,930
We just having fun
with this, Troy.

914
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:37,764
Fun?

915
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,099
Yes, fun.

916
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:42,769
Everything in life ain't
about fun though, Rhonda.

917
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,230
Me working all these hours
and paying for her daycare

918
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,733
that you refuse to
take her to, ain't fun.

919
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:49,985
OK, Troy.

920
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:50,777
No.

921
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:51,945
No, you come here.

922
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,614
Let me tell you something--
Troy.

923
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:55,406
I better not see you
wearing no makeup--

924
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:56,783
Let my daughter go.

925
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,284
--or anything of
you mama's stuff.

926
00:42:58,286 --> 00:42:59,452
You got to go, Troy.

927
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,245
You got to go.

928
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:01,037
You a little girl.

929
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,038
Troy.

930
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,874
And you, your
priorities is fucked up.

931
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:04,668
Get out of my face.

932
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,004
Get your hands off my daughter.

933
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:12,340
I'm going to work every day
to come home to this bullshit.

934
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:13,466
You got me fucked up.

935
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:14,510
Get out of my face, Troy.

936
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:15,511
The fuck is this?

937
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:17,012
Troy give me my fucking phone.
Hold on.

938
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,013
Hold on.
Hold on.

939
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,515
Give me my motherfucking phone.
Hello?

940
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:20,306
Troy.

941
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:22,350
Oh.

942
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:23,393
No.

943
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:24,811
Say something now,
you coward ass nigga.

944
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:25,854
Troy, really?

945
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:28,273
Baby daddy, baby daddy,
that nigga crazy.

946
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,900
No you got shit fucked up.

947
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:31,067
Give me my fucking phone.

948
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:32,193
You got shit fucked up.

949
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:34,863
I told-- I told you
all you gotta do was--

950
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:38,992
--yo ass going to
be fucked up, girl.

951
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,703
Get yo shit and get the
fuck out of my house.

952
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:49,377
I hate his ass.

953
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,463
Something new this weekend.

954
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,347
You're ignorant.

955
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,767
Hey, I'm forever seeing you all
having these private sessions.

956
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:05,226
Can I hit that?

957
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,603
Yeah, why not?

958
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:09,022
I ain't talking about the
weed I got a hell of that.

959
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,231
I'm talking about that pussy.

960
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:13,860
So fucking disrespectful.

961
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,320
How so, Carla?

962
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:16,988
Closed mouth don't get fed.

963
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,658
And plus, I was talking
about Janine, the dick fiend.

964
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:23,453
These fuck boys.

965
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:24,621
I'll be that.

966
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,998
I wouldn't say that
everybody likes my kitty.

967
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,250
But you got one small problem.

968
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:30,043
One small problem.

969
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:32,045
Small as hell.

970
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:35,632
Hey, Carla, Janine, I was
just bullshitting y'all.

971
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,467
You know damn well
I don't smoke no--

972
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,301
What's up OG?

973
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:39,469
I like that laugh track.

974
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:40,261
What's up boy?

975
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:43,181
I ain't making no noise.

976
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,016
Cousin.

977
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:47,519
Ah, shit.

978
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,896
I know any time you start a
sentence off saying cousin,

979
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:51,565
you're about to
ask me something.

980
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,526
Janine.

981
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:57,403
Janine the dick fiend.

982
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:59,239
Janine.

983
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,031
Janine.

984
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:04,870
Name Janine the dick fiend.

985
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:07,372
Janine.

986
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,415
It's Janine.

987
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:12,628
Janine the dick fiend.

988
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,795
Always a hoe.

989
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:14,757
Fuck y'all.

990
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:27,601
Young blood, what's
going on with it?

991
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:28,769
Everything all right?

992
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:32,105
I don't normally catch
you in here this early.

993
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:36,151
Man, bitches ain't shit.

994
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:37,402
The usual?

995
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,155
Yeah.

996
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:42,407
Very well.

997
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:47,453
I hope this helps you in the
right way, not the wrong way.

998
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:48,415
I hope so, man.

999
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:07,810
Hey, handsome.

1000
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,270
What's up?

1001
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,065
You look stressed.

1002
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:18,276
I'm Cherry.

1003
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,945
Cherry, huh?

1004
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,279
That's right.

1005
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:25,202
That wonderfully delicious
fruit that always goes on top.

1006
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,746
So you're a writer, huh?

1007
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:30,916
That I am.

1008
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:39,881
You know today's Wednesday, and
our WCW special still in play

1009
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,593
until 2:00.

1010
00:46:42,595 --> 00:46:46,805
That's half off all private
sessions in our champagne room.

1011
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:49,099
Hey, can I get another one?

1012
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:53,396
All you got to do is choose
a girl and take a key.

1013
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,191
So, um--

1014
00:46:58,193 --> 00:46:59,693
Cherry.

1015
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:01,194
Yeah, Cherry.

1016
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:05,115
Um, so I can pick any
girl in here, huh?

1017
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:06,407
That's right.

1018
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:09,496
And there's five more just
like me you can choose from.

1019
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,751
Oh.

1020
00:47:15,753 --> 00:47:17,002
Shit.

1021
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,506
Don't get me wrong, I
mean, you fine as hell,

1022
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:24,177
but uh, what's with that
brown chick over there?

1023
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:28,847
Oh.

1024
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,517
Alicia?

1025
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,603
Yeah, Alicia.

1026
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:38,524
What's with her?

1027
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:40,859
No shade, playa.

1028
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,653
I'll go get miss Alicia.

1029
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:00,378
What's up?

1030
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:03,298
Pop it back.

1031
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,425
Roll that body like Shakira do.

1032
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:08,970
Yeah pop that body, roll
that body like Shakira do.

1033
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:09,971
What's up, everybody?

1034
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,431
It's your girl
Frankie Finch, and I'm

1035
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,977
chilling with my
main man, Rob Jones.

1036
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,107
Mama?

1037
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,276
Girl, where's your baby at?

1038
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:24,110
She good.

1039
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:25,028
Michelle got her.

1040
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,948
All I need is half
the move-in fee.

1041
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,991
Ty said he was going
to handle the rest.

1042
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:32,786
And how do you expect to finance
this mystery home of yours, DJ?

1043
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,830
Daddy said he was going
to take care of all that.

1044
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:36,372
Girl, ain't nobody
seen your daddy

1045
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,499
in two motherfucking years.

1046
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,834
Fuck is you talking about?

1047
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,252
Plus I heard they looking
for him for child support

1048
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:43,880
for some other woman's baby
we ain't never even heard of.

1049
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,549
That's what we heard.

1050
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:46,341
Exactly.

1051
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:47,718
Everybody did.

1052
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,178
I gave you condoms to prevent
you from getting popped off.

1053
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,346
And look at the outcome.

1054
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,890
I also told you to take
the shot from the doctor.

1055
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:56,059
You know those shots
make me gain weight.

1056
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:59,104
And so do pregnancy,
dumb ass DJ.

1057
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,147
What is your rabbit
ass mind makes

1058
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:03,650
you think I'm going to
give you another $100

1059
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:06,194
on top of the cash I
already gave you yesterday?

1060
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,530
Ma, I said I'm gonna pay you
the money back by tomorrow.

1061
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,282
How the fuck you going to pay me
back and you ain't got no job?

1062
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:12,701
You won't be saying
that shouldn't

1063
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,662
when you be buying Mike Jordans
and video games and shit.

1064
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:18,624
Look, we're not going to
bring Michael into this, OK?

1065
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,416
Because it's a whole
other different thing

1066
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:21,960
when it comes to Michael, OK?

1067
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,962
Michael was an
honor roll student.

1068
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,213
He gets straight A's.

1069
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,007
He's on the basketball team.

1070
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,759
And he ain't a problem child.

1071
00:49:28,761 --> 00:49:30,927
And his father
pays child support.

1072
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:34,430
So Michael was entitled to
every damn thing God get him.

1073
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:35,974
You sound stupid as hell.

1074
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,100
Now look at you.

1075
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:38,935
You done slid your
ass down the razor

1076
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:40,771
blade or two of alcohol river.

1077
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:42,939
You're on your own
with this one, sweetie.

1078
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,149
Do you get that?

1079
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,652
What the fuck have your
father done for me?

1080
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:49,445
What have the son of a
bitch ever even gave me?

1081
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:52,616
Nothing but a fucking
headache, and the mistake

1082
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:56,620
of a child that's nothing but
a problem, just like his ass.

1083
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:57,954
So that's how you feel about me?

1084
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,289
Yes I do.

1085
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,331
Pick your head up.

1086
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,792
Because you need to
hear this, sweetie.

1087
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:04,002
Everything I put out,
I expect a return.

1088
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,629
You see these clients in here?

1089
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,297
They pay for my time.

1090
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:09,174
This is my business, sweetie.

1091
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,425
Let's get that clear.

1092
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:13,512
I don't have a luxury like
you, to lay on my back

1093
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:16,640
and get knocked up, and
live rent for fucking free.

1094
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:18,016
Fuck out of here.

1095
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:21,562
All I asked you to do was use
your link card to make sure you

1096
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:23,063
keep food in the refrigerator.

1097
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:24,567
And you can't even do that.

1098
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,571
And that's because
sticky man eat

1099
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:32,405
everything I put up in there.

1100
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:33,200
Whatever.

1101
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:36,577
Hey, baby.

1102
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:39,370
Hey.

1103
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:40,622
Got some money, baby?
Yeah.

1104
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:41,915
Got a few dollars?
Of course.

1105
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,876
Look in my purse.

1106
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,545
Wow.

1107
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,964
Really?

1108
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:49,923
Yeah.

1109
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:51,091
Really though?

1110
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:52,759
I'm filling out applications.

1111
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,219
Nobody's calling me back.

1112
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,429
How the hell do you
expect to get a call back

1113
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:57,973
and you smoke weed all damn day.

1114
00:50:57,975 --> 00:51:00,433
But I'm going to help you out
with the bills and everything.

1115
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:02,769
How The hell you going to
help me out with some bills?

1116
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:04,312
Me and DJ about to have a baby.

1117
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,439
DJ gonna what?

1118
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:07,691
Really, though?

1119
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,193
So you going to
look out for him,

1120
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:13,655
but you can't even look
out for your own daughter?

1121
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,073
The nerve of this heifer.

1122
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:16,742
I've been looking out
for your black ass

1123
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:18,451
since the day I put
you on this Earth.

1124
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,871
So I'm confused as to
what you're talking about.

1125
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:23,832
Who baby says through school
hours when you need it?

1126
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,041
Me.

1127
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:27,628
Who puts clothes on Angel's
back when she need it?

1128
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,920
Me.

1129
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:31,006
Sure ain't Tosh,
Because they neither one

1130
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:33,133
of y'all dummies got a pot
to piss in and a window

1131
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,510
to throw it back out of.

1132
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:35,719
My baby.

1133
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:38,555
I thought you would be
happy to have a grandchild.

1134
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:41,182
Um, Tosh, I thought
you was dumb,

1135
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:45,311
but I just realized how
fucking stupid you are.

1136
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:46,980
I'm 36 years old.

1137
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:50,526
Why in the fuck would I want
to be a grandma, damn fool?

1138
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:52,152
Have you lost your mind?

1139
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:54,696
How the hell y'all going
to take care of a baby?

1140
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:57,866
For one, you don't even
clean up after yourself

1141
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,367
and wipe your own ass.

1142
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,244
You ain't got a pot to piss in.

1143
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:04,455
You steady coming to me,
asking me for fucking money.

1144
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:06,082
So how in the hell
are you and DJ

1145
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,584
going to take care of a baby?

1146
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:10,003
She dumb her goddamn self.

1147
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:13,381
Do you actually think I'm going
to be happy with a son who

1148
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:16,677
done impregnated another dummy?

1149
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:18,762
Neither one of
y'all was educated.

1150
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:21,472
Don't neither one of y'all
have a high school diploma.

1151
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:23,934
So how in the fuck y'all
going to take care of a baby?

1152
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:25,644
See, sweetie, let
me put you on game.

1153
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:27,353
Me and Melvin has
this little thing

1154
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,439
called a relationship,
something you

1155
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,024
might not know nothing about.

1156
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:33,527
If you don't like the way
I manage my love life,

1157
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:35,403
you know exactly
what you can do.

1158
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:36,362
Exactly.

1159
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:37,363
Have a good day.

1160
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:38,156
Whatever, then.

1161
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:38,949
Exactly.

1162
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:40,202
Get the fuck away from me.

1163
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,548
So tight.

1164
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,675
So tight.

1165
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:58,594
DJ Killa got beats.

1166
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:00,470
So tight.

1167
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,263
So tight.

1168
00:53:02,265 --> 00:53:04,182
So tight.

1169
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:06,309
So tight.

1170
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:10,105
Young female gotta grind
hard on my own with no help.

1171
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:13,859
I'm a loner in this cold world,
so this girl do full self.

1172
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,694
My pops in the pen, doing life.

1173
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:17,529
My grandparents
gonna hold me down.

1174
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:20,031
My daddy murdered my
mama on Christmas.

1175
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,407
I live with no soul now.

1176
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:25,203
I seen it all in my own now,
so I never trust a nigga now.

1177
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:27,664
On everything I
love joke on life

1178
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:28,915
I could take a nigger down.

1179
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:29,791
I'm so hurt.

1180
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:30,834
I'm so lost.

1181
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:31,752
I'm fucked up.

1182
00:53:31,754 --> 00:53:32,919
My man gone.

1183
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,796
Rep to the big homie cocky.

1184
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,507
I know I gotta stay strong.

1185
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:38,466
This city living
just ain't right,

1186
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:40,468
when the city done me wrong.

1187
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,679
A hoe don't even cry
no more, but a bitch

1188
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:43,930
never gets turned out.

1189
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:45,682
I gotta get my face up.

1190
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:48,685
Sometime want to throw
the towel in, walk around

1191
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,228
with this hella
pain, like I don't

1192
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,479
need a motherfucking friend.

1193
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:53,273
No, I don't need a
motherfucking man.

1194
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:55,441
I don't need a
motherfucking hand.

1195
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:58,111
Blueprint, yes in the
plans, strong shit yeah,

1196
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,154
in the stance.

1197
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:00,989
Real talk, because
when the day ends,

1198
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,868
I never really understand why
I gotta wake up and live life

1199
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,120
every day in this bogus land.

1200
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,338
Why the sad face?

1201
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,801
We should be celebrating.

1202
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:23,178
Ain't no female emcee
in the city spitting

1203
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,387
harder than you right now.

1204
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,765
And that track right
there proves it.

1205
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:31,436
Record labels would be deaf
and dumb not to sign you.

1206
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,979
Is it really that good?

1207
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:33,814
Yeah.

1208
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:35,607
Even your cuz thought so.

1209
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,359
It was heartfelt. It was
like the walls in the booth

1210
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:42,238
started shaking and some shit.

1211
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:47,118
Look, I know a joint we
can go to not too far

1212
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,745
to toast to these
multi-million dollar

1213
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,080
moves you're about to make.

1214
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,790
Everything on me.

1215
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,750
I could use a drink.

1216
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:57,253
You know it's not a party
unless Mary is invited.

1217
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:59,422
Girl, I do not blow.

1218
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:00,215
Come on.

1219
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:01,382
Just for the occasion?

1220
00:55:01,384 --> 00:55:02,425
Please?

1221
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,344
Just one toke.

1222
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,721
No.

1223
00:55:05,723 --> 00:55:08,391
It enhances your appetite,
make you want to eat.

1224
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:15,021
You could use some
meat on your bones.

1225
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:15,941
Girl, give it here.

1226
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:20,443
Which end I light this on?

1227
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:21,279
The loose one.

1228
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:35,333
Being a Black female in
the streets of Chicago,

1229
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:42,173
life wasn't ever easy for
me, not even as a kid.

1230
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:48,722
Witnessing my mom be killed
right in front of me by my dad,

1231
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:51,642
I mean, it really
did something for me.

1232
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,701
You know I always
said desperation

1233
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,288
breeds some of the
biggest mistakes in life.

1234
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,586
And childhood trauma transforms
into bad adult behavior.

1235
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,768
My daddy going to kill me.

1236
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:35,936
He gonna kill you?

1237
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,771
You dead already.

1238
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:39,107
We already dead.

1239
00:57:09,262 --> 00:57:13,098
For God gave them up
to foul attractions.

1240
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,183
And tonight, I'm going
to skin your ass.

1241
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:16,017
No, Les.

1242
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,604
Don't you hit me again.

1243
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:19,855
Beat the dough out of you.

1244
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,857
How the hell you going
to talk about nature when

1245
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,527
you fucked me when I was 11?

1246
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:26,862
I didn't.

1247
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:31,032
I-- I didn't.

1248
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:31,869
Yes, Grandma.

1249
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,831
You sickening piece of shit.

1250
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,750
Lester, we don't
have relationships

1251
00:57:39,752 --> 00:57:42,753
with our grandchildren.

1252
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:44,963
That's just downright perverted.

1253
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:46,089
I di--

1254
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:47,425
That's an abomination.

1255
00:57:50,763 --> 00:57:54,180
And you lucky I don't
tell Mech about this shit.

1256
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:56,266
He would have killed
your ass, Granddaddy.

1257
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:58,020
He would have shot
your ass down.

1258
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,234
And you can go to the church,
and hide behind a Bible,

1259
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,612
and judge how the fuck
you want, but it's

1260
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:11,158
only one person who should
be begging for God's mercy.

1261
00:58:17,998 --> 00:58:18,791
She--

1262
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:27,883
Lester, we don't have relations
with our grandchildren.

1263
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:35,722
That's an abomination.

1264
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:39,100
As I said, bad adult
behavior is often

1265
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:42,270
linked to childhood trauma.

1266
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,439
And it's the perfect
example of that.

1267
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:10,903
And just like that,
a young life is over.

1268
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:16,364
So when you look at
the drama in my city,

1269
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:19,367
as it pertained to
young black man,

1270
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,787
you look at the home front.

1271
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:24,372
Sometimes lack of love
turns into an evil person.

1272
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:49,439
What's this?

1273
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,149
I don't mean to bother
you, but my car just broke

1274
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:54,277
down in front of your house.

1275
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:57,614
And I can't even call AAA
because my phone is dead.

1276
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:58,740
I'm so lost over here.

1277
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:01,451
You mind if I charge my
phone for five minutes,

1278
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:04,495
or maybe even use
yours to call for help?

1279
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,206
Please?

1280
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:07,666
Uh--

1281
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:09,167
Please?

1282
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,085
I'll even pay you.

1283
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,086
No.

1284
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:12,462
No, sweetie, you
don't have to pay me.

1285
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:13,338
Come on in.

1286
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,217
Oh, God bless you.

1287
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:22,182
Come follow me.

1288
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:26,392
Where did you come from?

1289
01:01:26,394 --> 01:01:28,981
Girl, I thought I was
going to have to hitchhike.

1290
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:51,084
Why don't you hand
me your phone?

1291
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:51,877
I'll charge it.

1292
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:52,669
Sure.

1293
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:53,463
Thank you.

1294
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,766
Listen for the sounder, J
Cole sounder, in 11:00AM,

1295
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:07,726
4:00PM, and 7:00PM hours.

1296
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,145
Listen, I just gave
you the time, OK?

1297
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:12,939
11:00AM, 4:00PM, 7:00PM
hours, that's when

1298
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:13,942
you need to be tuning in.

1299
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:18,987
I had made up my
mind that I was going

1300
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,282
to take my black ass home.

1301
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:34,795
You have a beautiful family.

1302
01:02:34,797 --> 01:02:37,422
Are they twins?

1303
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:43,845
Yes, identical,
double the trouble.

1304
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:44,765
But they're so cute.

1305
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:51,019
And the guy, is that your--

1306
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:52,147
It's my children's father.

1307
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:59,110
Must be nice.

1308
01:02:59,112 --> 01:02:59,905
It's fair.

1309
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:06,201
I'm sorry.

1310
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:07,744
I gotta wait for my
phone to come on so I can

1311
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:10,038
get the contact from my phone.

1312
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,372
OK.

1313
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:12,207
No problem.

1314
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:14,793
Relax.

1315
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:17,588
You know, it ain't
every day that people

1316
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,882
are willing to help strangers.

1317
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:25,263
Yeah well, this could very well
be me one day, stranded, lost.

1318
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,102
You're so right.

1319
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:58,629
No, they said it's a severe
thunderstorm warning tonight.

1320
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:00,005
You think a truck might--

1321
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:04,092
I don't know if a truck will
be able to come out this way.

1322
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:04,887
So right.

1323
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:17,355
Hello?

1324
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:21,234
I'm at 10611 South
Longwood Drive.

1325
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:22,154
My car won't start.

1326
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:27,783
Khalees Stewart.

1327
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:30,201
Liberty Jeep.

1328
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:30,994
B62--

1329
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:33,872
L-O-V-E

1330
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:38,461
Thank you very much.

1331
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:44,007
How did you know my address?

1332
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:47,010
That was right on
the door, right?

1333
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,386
It's correct, right?

1334
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,846
So, what are you
doing over here?

1335
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:50,974
Were you visiting a friend?

1336
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,232
Oh, my god.

1337
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:03,946
Oh, my god.

1338
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,365
He left me.

1339
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:11,535
He who?

1340
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:13,371
He left me and I'm pregnant.

1341
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,171
Two whole years I
stuck by this man.

1342
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:25,423
And all he can do is throw
me out like I'm some piece

1343
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:27,425
of dirty laundry or some shit.

1344
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:32,764
I just don't understand.

1345
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:36,602
Look, look, sweetie, we've
all been down heartbreak road

1346
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:38,854
before.

1347
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:41,147
You'll be OK.

1348
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:44,025
It's the future of the baby
you need to worry about now.

1349
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,987
Allow that to be your
motivation as you

1350
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:49,364
pull forward through this.

1351
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:50,448
You'll get through it.

1352
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,407
You'll be OK.

1353
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:54,911
We've all been
through some shit.

1354
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:55,871
You're so right.

1355
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:58,206
You're OK.

1356
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,125
You know what?

1357
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,086
I can't let no man kill me.

1358
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:04,505
That's right, baby girl.

1359
01:06:04,507 --> 01:06:09,676
Hey look, and kill what's ever
allowing that man to mistreat

1360
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:10,638
you in the first place.

1361
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:16,432
You can't let him win.

1362
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:17,559
It's about you.

1363
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:20,478
It's about your baby.

1364
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,774
Let me go get you some Kleenex.

1365
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:27,404
Thank you, Bianca.

1366
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,788
Troy, you really
should feel lucky,

1367
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:40,290
because I don't usually let
niggas in my crib like that,

1368
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:43,835
so consider yourself a VIP.

1369
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,547
Ah, shit, I ain't getting no
chicken overall pipe, this baby

1370
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:50,967
mine, so consider yourself VIP.

1371
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,094
Ooh, yep.

1372
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:55,972
That's that daddy dick, too.

1373
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:59,768
But you don't want to
give it to Li-Li no more.

1374
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:05,356
Man, shit's been
hectic at the crib, you know.

1375
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:06,193
Oh, god.

1376
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:10,904
I got to be there for
my daughter, though.

1377
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:14,658
OK, Troy, and I got
a daughter, too.

1378
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,285
But I respond to your
calls and your texts.

1379
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:19,746
Come on Alicia don't
start that bullshit.

1380
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:21,331
Don't worry about it.

1381
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,542
I ain't short on no
nigga because I work

1382
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:24,960
at the gentleman's
club and you're

1383
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:28,630
going to have to remember that.

1384
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:30,716
Yeah, you should be
proud of yourself.

1385
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:31,675
Oh, I am.

1386
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:33,426
I'm proud that I
can pay my own bills

1387
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:36,012
and hold my own
weight, Unlike Rhonda

1388
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:40,726
squeezing your tired ass dry
from your little factory job.

1389
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:43,103
You know what?

1390
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:45,522
That's all right.

1391
01:07:45,524 --> 01:07:47,109
I give you your
,, bitch.

1392
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:54,282
Yo, Troy,
get the fuck out.

1393
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:03,999
Alicia, come on, man.

1394
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:07,377
I was just
bullshitting with you.

1395
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:08,171
Alicia.

1396
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,984
Little mama, come on out so I
can hug at you for a minute.

1397
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:34,031
Alicia, come on, man.

1398
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:39,034
[PILLS SPILL AND ECHO

1399
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:48,585
DRAMATICALLY]

1400
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:49,379
What's that?

1401
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:58,929
Alicia, what is that?

1402
01:08:58,931 --> 01:08:59,765
What?

1403
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:04,685
Alicia!

1404
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,102
It's my meds, Troy.

1405
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,228
Meds for what, though?

1406
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,148
Meds for what?

1407
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,776
Meds for what?

1408
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,697
It's STD medication.

1409
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:22,913
Troy.

1410
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,333
Man-- man, we've
been laying down

1411
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:30,669
together, doing all this shit,
and you couldn't tell me?

1412
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:31,503
Sorry.

1413
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:34,339
I didn't know what to say.

1414
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:36,257
I'm in a whole
fucking relationship.

1415
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:40,178
Fuck your relationship.

1416
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,514
You got me fucked up.

1417
01:09:42,516 --> 01:09:43,682
You got me fucked up.

1418
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:44,474
No.

1419
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:46,643
Fuck that.

1420
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:33,189
You know, I can
only hope to be as

1421
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:36,442
beautiful as a person like you.

1422
01:10:36,444 --> 01:10:39,573
He handsome, what's
keeping you all up so late?

1423
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,870
Uh, Alicia Jackson residence?

1424
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:47,871
Huh?

1425
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:48,664
What?

1426
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,874
What'd you say?

1427
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:54,004
Alicia Jackson, says on
this ID that she lives here.

1428
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:59,009
Oh, are you talking about Li-Li?

1429
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:02,468
Yeah.

1430
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:03,261
She up here now.

1431
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:05,639
What's happening?

1432
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:08,517
How do you know my name?

1433
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:10,727
And there ain't no
address on my door.

1434
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:13,479
You want to tell me
why you in my house?

1435
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:15,398
Bianca, you told me--

1436
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,527
B I didn't tell you shit.

1437
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:22,698
We're practically family.

1438
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:26,034
Um, well, you mind if
I give this to her?

1439
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:29,414
You the boyfriend,
or husband, or--

1440
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:34,710
Oh, man, no.

1441
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:36,461
I'm her brother, man.

1442
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:37,253
Nah, come on in.

1443
01:11:37,255 --> 01:11:38,254
Yeah, it's all good.

1444
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:40,924
She up in the
bathroom, all right?

1445
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:43,552
Let's just say I'm
the woman that's

1446
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:47,013
doing everything you won't do.

1447
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,265
See, you done had
these babies, and you

1448
01:11:49,267 --> 01:11:50,475
done got a little comfortable.

1449
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:52,268
Bitch, you don't know
shit about my babies.

1450
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,771
Mason, grab mommy's
phone and dial 911.

1451
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,898
I'm in love with
their father, and I

1452
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,567
ain't going to let no bitch--

1453
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:13,206
My baby.

1454
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,251
Oh.

1455
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:18,169
I see you in my house--

1456
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:19,420
What the fuck?

1457
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,006
Mommy shot her.

1458
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:51,204
DJ, please eat something.

1459
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:55,626
You got to get out
of this bed, baby.

1460
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:01,882
DJ was left to be the single
parent of two children.

1461
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:18,605
My heart practically
fell out of my ass.

1462
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:21,441
Sometimes we got to
put it all on a scale.

1463
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:25,696
If it don't weigh out fellas,
then don't fuck with it.

1464
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:30,116
Not only did Khalees die, but
the unborn child inside of her

1465
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:31,078
didn't make it, either.

1466
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:43,296
Ma, I miss my daddy.

1467
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,799
I miss him too, baby.

1468
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:48,218
Troy was arrested and
found the next day

1469
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:52,681
red handed with the firearm
that he killed Alicia with.

1470
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:56,476
Bloody situation,
he'll probably do life.

1471
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,941
You're under arrest for
homicide of Alicia Jackson.

1472
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:10,532
Oh, you slept good last
night, didn't you Levine?

1473
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:15,370
Did you get a good
night's sleep last night?

1474
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:17,706
Bet you didn't hear those dogs.

1475
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,458
You don't hear the dogs anymore.

1476
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,587
You used to hear
them all the time.

1477
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:27,423
I wonder what happened
to those dogs.

1478
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:30,135
Somebody may have poisoned them.

1479
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:32,470
I didn't hear you say anything.

1480
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:33,764
I was talking to you in there.

1481
01:14:33,766 --> 01:14:36,808
I was telling you about
what a nice day it was.

1482
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,935
Good morning, short stack.

1483
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:41,229
The dog's not barking at all.

1484
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,189
I noticed that.

1485
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:46,234
It was just as quiet
and peaceful last night.

1486
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:49,404
Oh that was wonderful.

1487
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,156
I don't know what
stopped him from barking.

1488
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:52,866
But the little
rabbit over there,

1489
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,786
was so nice to see
the rabbit over there.

1490
01:14:55,788 --> 01:14:57,287
I looked out the door--

1491
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,040
I don't eat everybody's cooking.

1492
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:03,794
You just never know how
crazy people are sometimes.

1493
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:06,337
They do all kinds of things.

1494
01:15:06,339 --> 01:15:08,840
I told you about the
little bunny rabbit, right?

1495
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:14,429
But you know-- you know,
we don't have relations

1496
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:15,683
with our grandchildren.

1497
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:26,024
So are we still going to go to
that barbecue that the people--

1498
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,903
--you know, I don't know
that lady, but she's--

1499
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:33,239
--riding the subway.

1500
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:36,492
I was thinking the other
day about when I used

1501
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:39,538
to go fishing with my grandpa.

1502
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,372
Oh, boy.

1503
01:15:41,374 --> 01:15:44,042
We'd catch bluegills.

1504
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:46,211
We come back and
scale those fish,

1505
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:48,672
we'd eat on those fish all day.

1506
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:50,799
I like mine with
hot sauce on them.

1507
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:52,634
You know she used
to get the smaller--

1508
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:55,596
we'd come home from fishing,
and scale those fish,

1509
01:15:55,598 --> 01:15:56,763
and eat them all day.

1510
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,098
I like hot sauce on mine.

1511
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,475
You like hot sauce?

1512
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:03,729
You want Lucky Charms today?

1513
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:06,147
Did you want Lucky Charms?

1514
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:08,441
You never told me if
you wanted Lucky Charms.

1515
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:10,485
Raspberry red.

1516
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,946
We don't hear
those dogs anymore.

1517
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:14,781
Ain't that something?

1518
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:16,074
Well, I like it.

1519
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:18,827
You can open the window and
get you some rest at night.

1520
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:20,623
I got some good
sleep last night.

1521
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:39,515
DJ Smile.

1522
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:43,186
Give it up for my
man, Mech Levine.

1523
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:49,065
Yeah.

1524
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,400
Yeah.

1525
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,403
Yeah, how all you doing?

1526
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:04,164
Lady, I would like to tell you
that was an awesome and most

1527
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,373
spectacular performance.

1528
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,625
Yes.
Yes.

1529
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:08,710
Hands down, best performance
I ever saw in my life.

1530
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:10,128
Absolutely.

1531
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,589
You are the absolute type
of artist-- the best artist

1532
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,299
that we've been looking
for in our label.

1533
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:16,092
And we'd like to
sign you immediately.

1534
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:19,429
Lady's life had soon
become a success story.

1535
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:21,640
She won first place
at the convention,

1536
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:25,310
getting her signed to a record
deal with a hefty advancement.

1537
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,355
That right there puts
a smile on my face.

1538
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:30,899
Y'all better know it.

1539
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:33,777
So tight.

1540
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,779
So tight.

1541
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:38,740
So tight.

1542
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:40,241
So tight.

1543
01:17:40,243 --> 01:17:41,201
So tight.

1544
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:44,204
So tight.

1545
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,706
So tight.

1546
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:48,792
Young female gotta grind
hard on my own with no help.

1547
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,711
I'm a loner in this cold world.

1548
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:52,546
So this girl do for herself.

1549
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:54,422
My pops in the pen doing life.

1550
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,257
My grandparents
don't hold me down.

1551
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:58,760
My daddy murdered my
mama on Christmas.

1552
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:00,053
I live with no soul, now.

1553
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:02,055
I seen it all on my own life.

1554
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:03,890
So I never trust no nigga now.

1555
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:06,351
On everything I
love, joke on life.

1556
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:07,603
I could take a nigger down.

1557
01:18:07,605 --> 01:18:08,520
I'm so hurt.

1558
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:09,521
I'm so lost.

1559
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:10,396
I'm fucked up.

1560
01:18:10,398 --> 01:18:11,607
My man gone.

1561
01:18:11,609 --> 01:18:13,483
Reps to the big homie cocky.

1562
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,193
I know I gotta stay strong.

1563
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:17,153
This city living
just ain't right

1564
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:19,155
when the city done me wrong.

1565
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:21,366
A hoe don't even cry
no more, but a bitch

1566
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:22,618
never gets turned out.

1567
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,410
I gotta give my up.

1568
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:26,663
Sometime want to
throw the towel in.

1569
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,874
Walk around with this
hella pain like I don't

1570
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:30,166
need a motherfucking friend.

1571
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:32,252
I don't need a
motherfucking man.

1572
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,129
I don't need a
motherfucking hand.

1573
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:37,883
Blueprint, yes and the plan,
strong shit gas in the stance.

1574
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:40,511
Real talk, when the
day ends, I never

1575
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:44,264
really understand why I gotta
wake up and live life every day

1576
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:45,849
in this bogus land.

1577
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,041
Check.

1578
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:12,417
So tour.

1579
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,585
Yeah.

1580
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:15,461
I got a wife at
the crib that love

1581
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:17,839
to cook and clean,
take care of the kids,

1582
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,215
give me everything I need.

1583
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:21,467
But on the other hand,
I got this young fly

1584
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:24,805
thing, that'll throw it back for
daddy, and I never say please.

1585
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:26,264
The yin and the yang.

1586
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:27,599
The gift and the curse.

1587
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:30,519
Four arms, but there's
only room for one purse.

1588
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:34,606
How could I, or how should
I, choose between two Queens?

1589
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:35,398
Why would I?

1590
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,525
Talk to them, bro.

1591
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:39,319
I'm in a sticky situation.

1592
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,446
And I don't know what to do.

1593
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,032
See I like spending
time with her.

1594
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:46,451
On the other hand, I
love being with my boo.

1595
01:19:46,453 --> 01:19:47,285
Yeah.

1596
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:49,329
But I can only have one of them.

1597
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:52,541
So stressed out I'm on
a treadmill at the gym.

1598
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:54,084
Didn't want to go this route.

1599
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:56,377
Now I really need
to figure it out.

1600
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:57,671
Because I'm--

1601
01:19:57,673 --> 01:20:02,968
I'm going crazy, torn
in between two ladies.

1602
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,596
Every time I try to pick
one and make a stand,

1603
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:08,264
find myself with the
other woman again.

1604
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:13,770
And I'm going crazy, torn
in between two ladies.

1605
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:17,816
My god, I'm so confused, don't
know which one to choose.

1606
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:19,568
Which one to choose.

1607
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:21,864
Need to think fast,
running out of time.
