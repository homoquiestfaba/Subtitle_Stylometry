1
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:04,520
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:20,066
(upbeat music)
(applause, chattering)

3
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:33,926
- Listen.

4
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,458
The bosses are gonna kill
me, I have to get off.

5
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,139
One thing I have to tell you,

6
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,950
I should have told you
when I first came out.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,070
I'm one quarter German,
three quarters Irish,

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,087
which makes me a very meticulous drunk.

9
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:49,297
(audience laughs)

10
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:50,860
I think the humor comes
from the Irish side

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,180
because the Germans have never been known

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,154
as one of the great, fun races.

13
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,376
(audience laughs)

14
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:57,970
You see, the Germans,
they don't understand

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,750
American humor because Americans,

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,050
like we very often say the exact opposite

17
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,740
of what we mean and the
Germans, they're very literal.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,493
Like a German visitor might
come up to you and say,

19
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:13,193
"Would you explain something to me please?

20
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:20,727
"Your friend Curly, has no
hair at all on his head..

21
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,846
(audience laughs)

22
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:27,846
"And Tiny is over 350 pounds."
(audience laughs)

23
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,484
Thank you very much.

24
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,313
I hope you had as much
fun as I did tonight,

25
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:40,085
I really have to go, thank you very much.

26
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:45,085
(upbeat music)
(audience applause)

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,660
- [Woman] This show will
air tomorrow night after

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,506
the six o'clock news.

29
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,348
- [Todd] Well, that'd be great.

30
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,560
- [Man] In five, four, three, two.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,270
- Good evening, this is Nancy Hayes

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,800
and welcome to Nightlife.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,870
Tonight our guest is comedian Todd Wilson,

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,710
who's enjoying a smash
engagement here in Los Angeles.

35
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,720
Hi, Todd.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,870
- Hi Nancy.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,200
- For our Nightlife
audience out there, tell us,

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,980
what have you been up to?

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,630
- Well, I just closed
in Chicago, and I'm here

40
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,410
for another week and
then I'm up to Las Vegas

41
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,460
for three weeks.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,140
- Las Vegas.

43
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,060
It looks like everyone is
having such a good time.

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,640
Is it really that much fun?

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,860
- Oh, you should have time to find out.

46
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,990
It's the first time I've ever
played Las Vegas as a single.

47
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,740
I used to be half of a comedy team.

48
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,000
- I didn't know you were part of a team.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
How long were you guys together?

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,440
- Probably before you were born.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,463
Uh, actually, it was, uh, 25 years.

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,810
We had some tough times
over the years, but,

53
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,933
Archie never changed.

54
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:06,984
Archie?

55
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,820
He was like a little
kid, always having fun,

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,483
just trying to blend in with the crowd.

57
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:14,201
Archie?

58
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,687
Which, in Archie's case, wasn't so easy.

59
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:22,499
Archie?

60
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:25,416
(Archie vocalizes)

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,727
(soft carousel music)

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,540
I didn't know if you
wanted cookies or fruit,

63
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,680
so I got you a pear.

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,953
Just pretend the dark
spots are chocolate chips.

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,450
Cookies are loaded with sugar and fat.

66
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,105
You shouldn't eat anything
that's bad for you.

67
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:54,690
(Archie grumbles)

68
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,640
It's decaffeinated.

69
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:00,243
(Archie vocalizes)

70
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:03,730
(Archie vocalizes)

71
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,790
We found a hotel with plenty of vacancies

72
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,603
and it was easy to understand why.

73
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:12,390
But at least it had a
bathroom, which gave Archie

74
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,323
a place to hide while I unpacked.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,820
I swear, he could see through walls.

76
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,733
As soon as I finished, out
he'd come, no matter what.

77
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,140
(Archie grunts)

78
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,750
Archie, would you towel off?

79
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,750
You look like some hairball coughed up by

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,120
the world's biggest cat.
(Archie vocalizes)

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,893
This gig could be our big break, you know.

82
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,530
The bottom line is three paid weeks,

83
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,115
and these days, that is
nothing to sneeze at.

84
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:50,320
(Archie sneezes)

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,640
Very funny.
(Archie laughs)

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,270
A lot of heavyweights come into that club,

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,300
and we could get spotted
by some talent scout

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,993
who's looking for an opening
act for Wayne Newton.

89
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:07,400
(Archie vocalizes)

90
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,516
(kisses)

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,120
I'm sure it was good for her, too.

92
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,383
Night, kiddo

93
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,257
(Archie vocalizes)

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,217
(soft music)

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,670
You probably won't have
too much trouble guessing

96
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,490
what my dreams were like.

97
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:13,558
(upbeat music)
(applause, cheering)

98
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,567
Was she great or what,
ladies and gentlemen?

99
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,396
(applause, cheering)

100
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,343
You know, actually, I
loved having Anne Margaret

101
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,600
as our opening act.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,387
Well actually I liked her,
Archie prefers Jane Goodall.

103
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,637
(laughing)

104
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:35,316
(applause, cheering)

105
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:39,667
Ladies and gentlemen, my
partner, my best friend,

106
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,630
and ex-vice presidential candidate,

107
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,533
Archie right here, ladies and gentlemen.

108
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:50,377
(upbeat music)
(applause, cheering)

109
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:55,200
(soft music)

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,610
I always wondered what kind of stuff

111
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,350
Archie's dreams were about.

112
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,123
Probably just like mine.

113
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:12,581
(upbeat percussion music)
(animals vocalizing)

114
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,989
(snoring)

115
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,775
(upbeat, quirky music)

116
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,593
(knocking)

117
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:54,520
- Come on in.

118
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,680
- Usually, word of mouth had preceded us

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,980
when we played a new club.

120
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,450
Hi, are you Randy Mason?

121
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,851
- Sure am.

122
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,181
(Archie vocalizes)

123
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,700
And who are you?

124
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,313
- I'm Todd Wilson, and this is Archie.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
We start a three week gig here tonight.

126
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,230
- Your agent said that
you were a comedy team.

127
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,490
- We are.

128
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,097
He's the straight man.

129
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,513
Is there a problem?

130
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,350
- We're strictly a comedy club.

131
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,860
- We're strictly a comedy team.

132
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,460
My partner just happens to be a chimp.

133
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,293
(Archie vocalizes)

134
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,100
- Look, I can't bring
an animal act in here.

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,160
- Look, he doesn't ride
around the stage on a unicycle

136
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,930
or wear silly clothes, he
just, he works with me,

137
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,220
like any other comedy team.

138
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,243
- Look, uh, Todd?

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,747
I think we're gonna have to pass.

140
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:49,360
(Archie blows raspberry)
- We have a contract.

141
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800
I even had Archie's ax notarized.

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,330
- Look, I'm sorry but when
I signed that contract,

143
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,490
I thought I was making a
deal with a couple of guys.

144
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,480
- Oh.

145
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,120
Oh you don't think he's a guy, huh?

146
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,623
Archie, show him how macho you are.

147
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:05,980
(Archie yells)

148
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,630
Put a watch on him, he could
pass for Schwarzenegger.

149
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:15,191
(upbeat, quirky music)

150
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,040
I was getting the idea
by now that my agent

151
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,403
wasn't paying much
attention to our career.

152
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:30,008
(upbeat, quirky music)

153
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,023
Wait over there, and don't
chew on the magazines.

154
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:45,634
(upbeat, quirky music)

155
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,180
I'm Todd Wilson, I'd
like to see Irwin Stein.

156
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,380
- Will he know what
this is in reference to?

157
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,350
- I'm his client for the past 25 years.

158
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,403
I think, I think my
name might ring a bell.

159
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,181
- Fine.

160
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,570
- Hey, I told you this would happen.

161
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,810
20 years ago, you told me your dream was

162
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,257
to play a Vegas show room.

163
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,367
"Lose the chimpanzee," I said.

164
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,477
"Do stand up," I said, and
what did you say to me?

165
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,440
"I can't leave Archie."

166
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,260
He's holding you back, Todd.

167
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,920
Animal acts are passe,
with a capital pass.

168
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,850
- Do you know that a dying chimp

169
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,090
will sometimes hold off his death for days

170
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,303
just to die in the arms of his loved one?

171
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:33,397
Where do you see that kind
of loyalty among humans?

172
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,344
(door opens)

173
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,133
Irwin?

174
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,583
Ir, Irwin?

175
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,223
You're fired, Irwin.

176
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,093
Passe my foot.

177
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,650
You and I are as fresh
and funny as we were

178
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,437
25 years ago, and I know
just the place to prove it.

179
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,541
(upbeat, quirky music)

180
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,376
You see now these, these are real hotels.

181
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:10,270
I wonder how passe we're gonna seem

182
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,382
when we wind up playing in the show

183
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,963
in one of these babies. (chuckles)

184
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,458
(upbeat, quirky music)

185
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,006
I'll trade you half a tuna sandwich for

186
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,616
one of those bananas.

187
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:36,283
(Archie grunts)

188
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,433
Just a suggestion.

189
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:44,781
(Archie vocalizes)

190
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:49,054
(upbeat, quirky music)

191
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,410
How was I supposed to know it was a female

192
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,523
impersonator show?

193
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,523
All right.

194
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,872
Geisha Lounge.

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,833
No.

196
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,040
Seven lounges, seven no's.
(Archie vocalizes)

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,460
All right, let's go find a motel and

198
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,010
we'll try some more lounges tomorrow.

199
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,843
Come on.

200
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,026
Come on, Archie.

201
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,026
- Excuse me.

202
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,480
- We'd be working tonight
if uyou looked more

203
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,580
like Madame Butterfly.

204
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:35,179
(Archie grunts)

205
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:39,610
I've become a real expert
on motels over the years and

206
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,740
one of the things I've
noticed is that every time

207
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,240
you've stayed in what you think is

208
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,663
the biggest dump imaginable,

209
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,528
a worse one comes along.

210
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:55,865
(upbeat, quirky music)

211
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,110
Don't look at me like that.

212
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,660
We can't afford to pass up a bargain;

213
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,813
it's $10 a night.

214
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,230
It's only until we get a job on the strip.

215
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,620
Now, duck your head down.

216
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,353
Look, I don't make the rules.

217
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,470
The other thing I
figured is that somewhere

218
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,460
there's a motel God who
assigns desk clerks to

219
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,910
the motel that most, uh, perfectly fits

220
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,010
the personality.

221
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,890
- It's $20 a night, in advance.

222
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,723
- 20?

223
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:29,556
Your signs says 10.

224
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,204
- $10 a person.

225
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,037
You don't like it?

226
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,660
Go up the strip and try to find cheaper.

227
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,400
- All right here's for,

228
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,900
here's for two nights, but
for this kind of money,

229
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,813
we want privacy.

230
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,983
- Number 10, down on your left.

231
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,690
- Who was that?

232
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,430
- Oh, just another married
guy here for a convention,

233
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,940
shacking up with one of the local bimbos.

234
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,340
- Listen to this, Archie.

235
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,540
Chick Balton is putting together a big

236
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,373
25th anniversary show.

237
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,646
Did you remember to flush?

238
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,810
(Archie vocalizes)

239
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,470
They need singers, dancers,
(toilet flushes)

240
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,220
magicians, and other entertainers.

241
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,380
Chick Balton is the biggest
producer here in Las Vegas.

242
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,580
Did you wash your hands?

243
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:34,301
(Archie vocalizes)

244
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,140
A--

245
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,289
Archie?

246
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,710
(Archie vocalizes)
Don't.

247
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,690
Don't you dare lock that door.
(Archie vocalizes)

248
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,440
Archie, you know you're
not allowed to lock

249
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,294
the bathroom door, now open it.

250
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:46,127
(Archie vocalizes)
(knocking)

251
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:46,960
Open it!

252
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:50,265
- Oh, I'm sorry, I
thought you said open it.

253
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,098
- Uh.

254
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,270
I, uh.

255
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,570
Are you, are you the maid?

256
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:56,960
(doorknob jangling)

257
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,330
Stay, uh, stay in there, dad.

258
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,220
My father just, he just got out of the tub

259
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,010
and he isn't dressed.

260
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,518
- Don't worry, next time just put the

261
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,440
"Do Not Disturb" sign outside.

262
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,957
Well since I'm already here,
do you want me to make--

263
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:09,793
- Uh, no.

264
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,170
No, just, just leave the sheets.

265
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,433
Yeah, we'll make the bed ourselves.

266
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,066
We do it all the time.

267
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:21,240
Don't come out, dad, there's a lady here.

268
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,272
- You change your own sheets?

269
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,960
(Archie vocalizes)
(woman gasps)

270
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,793
- Dad.

271
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:30,050
(Archie vocalizes)
Don't be frightened.

272
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,303
- I'm not frightened.

273
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,590
I'm just, uh, trying to figure
out a way to let you know

274
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,523
that your father is a chimpanzee.

275
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,810
- This is Archie, and I'm Todd.

276
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,773
- Hi, Archie.

277
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:48,720
(upbeat, quirky music)

278
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,603
- [Todd] So we went over
to try to see Chick.

279
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,127
As in any good hotel,
their first line of defense

280
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:56,483
was at the front door.

281
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,499
That is kind of smart.

282
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:03,189
You, you have to get up
pretty early in the morning

283
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:04,022
to fool this guy.

284
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:04,963
- It's a monkey.

285
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,310
- Hey, have a little respect
for your ancestors, eh?

286
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,293
Park this in the VIP parking please.

287
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,345
(people chattering)

288
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:19,269
Come on Archie, come on, come on.

289
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,947
- I'm sorry sir, but, he
can't go in the casino.

290
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,660
- Oh, see I was afraid of that, Arch.

291
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,560
You've been spotted as a card counter.

292
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,970
It's a joke.

293
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,550
I'm Todd, and this is my partner, Archie.

294
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,980
We're here for the Chick Balton revue.

295
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,130
- Oh, that's different.

296
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,230
Let me check the list.

297
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,587
(people chattering)

298
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,143
I don't see Todd Wilson.

299
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:55,976
- Let me see.

300
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:56,809
Sometimes they....

301
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:00,057
(people chattering)

302
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:03,010
Sometimes they put Archie's name first.

303
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,843
Check...

304
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,057
Archie saw her before I did.

305
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:12,110
- Archie?

306
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,323
Archie.

307
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,186
- Guard! (whistles)

308
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:16,410
Get over here!
- No, no, it's all right.

309
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,243
I know him.

310
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:20,854
Where's your dad?

311
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:22,937
Archie, where's your dad?

312
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,770
(people chattering)

313
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,530
- Maybe it's under my last name, Wilson,

314
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,913
or maybe Archie's last name, Smith.

315
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,260
(Archie vocalizes)

316
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,930
She looked as great as ever.

317
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,603
Wish I could say the same for me.

318
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,148
Laura?
- Hello, Todd.

319
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:44,883
- You know this guy?

320
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:45,883
- I used to.

321
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,680
- I never, I never
thought I'd see you again.

322
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,780
- Should we go inside?

323
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,510
- In a minute.

324
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,503
- You trying out for the revue?

325
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,040
- Um.

326
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,010
Yes, you could say that.

327
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,800
- Uh, well, I have, I have to get going.

328
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,253
We're going to miss the opening at the...

329
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:10,887
Look at me, in your business.

330
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,960
I should be saying good bye.

331
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,273
Well it was, uh,

332
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,307
it was nice seeing you.

333
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:21,417
Come on Archie.

334
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:23,207
Come on.

335
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,500
(soft, romantic music)

336
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:48,191
After 15 years, you'd think
it wouldn't hurt anymore.

337
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,686
Okay, you'd better get some rest.

338
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:55,769
We're gonna try again in the morning.

339
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,419
(soft, romantic music)

340
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,881
(people chattering)

341
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,840
- [Man] Hey, you, black loafers.

342
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,673
Over here.

343
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,210
(Archie vocalizes)

344
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,043
- [Todd] I beg your pardon?

345
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:23,970
- Over here.

346
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,920
You need a shine.

347
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,923
- I'd love to, but I don't have the money.

348
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,283
Sam?

349
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,463
- You can't be Todd Wilson?

350
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,070
- Yes, I can.

351
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,468
- Well, Todd, you look good. (laughs)

352
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:43,468
Todd Wilson.

353
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,340
Is this your new partner?

354
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,730
- The same one as always.

355
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,780
- Well I'll be damned.

356
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,613
Archibald.

357
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,810
I would've thought that you had long since

358
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,890
left us for that big
banana ranch in the sky.

359
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,210
- Well his ticker isn't as
strong as it used to be, but,

360
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,043
he's doing okay.

361
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,560
- You just hop up here in this chair,

362
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,110
and let me give you a free one.

363
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,039
(Archie vocalizes)

364
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,730
There's some grapes in my bag there,

365
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,180
if you get hungry, Archibald.

366
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:19,490
- You know, you're the,
uh, you're the only one

367
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,623
he'd ever let call him that?

368
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:23,890
(chuckles)

369
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,870
When did you leave Miami?

370
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,840
- When my arthritis got fed up with all

371
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,373
that rain and humidity.

372
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,183
An old man's bones needs
this dry, desert air.

373
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,120
What about yourself?

374
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,973
- Oh, we're just here
trying to pick up a gig.

375
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,830
Problem is, some people
think that Archie and I don't

376
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,993
have a cutting edge act.

377
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,840
- Oh, bull.

378
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,020
You two were the best act that ever played

379
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,460
the Carousel Lounge on Biscayne Boulevard.

380
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,700
What did they hold you over for?

381
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,533
Six months?

382
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,050
(Archie vocalizes)

383
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,883
- Eight.

384
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:03,900
(machines rattling)

385
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,280
- Let's hope this broad's
over her headache from

386
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
last night and can sign those contracts,

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,471
'cause if she don't sign,
we don't have a show.

388
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,320
- Well maybe we can get
another singer to fill in.

389
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,330
- I spent six months stealing
her from The Paradise.

390
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,010
People don't wanna hear another singer,

391
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,773
they wanna hear Laura Connolly.

392
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,685
(knocking)

393
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,570
Hello.
- Mr. Balton.

394
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,540
- Oh please, please, call me Chick.

395
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,110
Everybody does, don't they, Greg?

396
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,060
- Yes, Mr. Balton.

397
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,170
- I thought maybe you'd be
ready to sign the contracts

398
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,800
for the show now.

399
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,300
- Won't you two please come in?

400
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,630
- Well, actually, Greg has
some stuff to take care of

401
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,130
down in the casino, but,
I think I can handle this

402
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,143
by myself.

403
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,810
- Come in, please.

404
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,643
- Thanks.

405
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,214
(clears throat)

406
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,430
I can't tell you how thrilled we are

407
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,480
that you've decided to headline the show.

408
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,083
- Thank you.

409
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,240
May I get you some coffee?

410
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,720
- Oh, thanks.

411
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,763
Black is fine.

412
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,933
Is the suite satisfactory?

413
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,983
- It's lovely.

414
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,310
But I would like to talk
to you about the contracts.

415
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,143
- Oh, sure.

416
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:25,069
(chuckles)

417
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,180
Right here, Miss Connolly,
and everything's just the

418
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,380
way we've worked it out.

419
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:29,780
I mean, your agent and I.

420
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,010
- I don't think I wanna sign.

421
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,010
- I beg your pardon?

422
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,020
- I meant, I don't think
I wanna sign until I get

423
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,710
just one more little thing.

424
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,000
- Oh. (chuckles)

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,720
Well name it, what?

426
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,737
Bigger dressing room, a
little more money, what?

427
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,570
What?

428
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,050
- Remember when we pulled in yesterday?

429
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,730
The chimpanzee?

430
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,740
- Yeah, yeah, you mean the
fuzz wad that groped you

431
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,573
by the limo?

432
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,420
- I want him in the revue.

433
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,210
With his owner, of course.

434
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,560
- Listen, I already have
magicians, skaters, jugglers.

435
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,770
What do we need a monkey act for?

436
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,470
- Because you don't have a singer.

437
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,243
Yet.

438
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,030
- Oh. (chuckles)

439
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,863
Oh.

440
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,900
Okay.

441
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,640
But I can't guarantee
him a slot in the revue

442
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,310
until I know they're funny, so
let me put 'em in the lounge.

443
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,210
If they work out, they'll
go right into the show.

444
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,783
Deal?

445
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,070
- Pass the contracts.

446
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,580
- The trick in this
business is to get yourself

447
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,456
a unique act and stick with it,

448
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,363
and that's the philosophy
Arch and I always live by.

449
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,173
What's his name?
- Terrance.

450
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:46,970
- Cute little guy, isn't he?
(Archie vocalizes)

451
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,243
Where's he from?

452
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,490
- England?

453
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,323
- You hear that?

454
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,810
He's English.

455
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,667
- [Man] Todd and Archie.

456
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,860
Todd and Archie.

457
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,340
- Listen, um, bring him around some time.

458
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,353
Archie'll show him some tricks.

459
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,300
(Terrance vocalizes)

460
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,330
It turned out to be
more of a lunch meeting

461
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,323
than an audition.

462
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,400
- Hold it right there.

463
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,560
He's a little old, isn't he?
(Archie vocalizes)

464
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,620
- Old?

465
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,692
Would you like to arm wrestle with him?

466
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:18,620
- I wonder how kids would
identify with a chimp that old.

467
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,453
- Kids love him.

468
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:23,000
He's like a cross between
a grandfather and a pet.

469
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,193
- Where's his props?

470
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,053
- [Todd] What props?

471
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:26,886
- Props?

472
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:27,719
Beach ball.

473
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,552
Jump rope.

474
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,640
Motorcycle.

475
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,570
- Archie doesn't do monkey tricks.

476
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,450
- Then excuse me, what does he do?

477
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,870
- It's what we do.

478
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,660
We do comedy.

479
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,790
- Who let this guy in here?

480
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,810
Thanks.

481
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,473
Next act, please.

482
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,153
(Archie vocalizes)

483
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,500
- You mean you're not
even gonna look at us?

484
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,402
- He said thank you.

485
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,485
- [Man] Next.

486
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:52,270
(upbeat pop rock music)

487
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,483
- Cowabunga, dudes.

488
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:57,407
- [Judges] Now this is more like it.

489
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,050
- If you could give me
a little beat there,

490
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,053
that would be great.

491
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:03,191
Okay?

492
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:04,706
See you tomorrow.

493
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,240
- Oh, Miss Connolly?

494
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,500
Hi, how's it going?

495
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,074
- Very well, thank you.

496
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:09,930
- About that chimpanzee.

497
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,000
- Todd and Archie.

498
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,920
- Tried the number you
gave me, but, Irwin Stein

499
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,420
said he no longer handles 'em.

500
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:16,900
- Well did he give you the
number of their new agent?

501
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,710
- As far as he knows, they don't have one,

502
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,320
and I'd love to keep
my end of the bargain,

503
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,880
but if I can't even find these--

504
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,713
- I'll find 'em.

505
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,020
- Good, and when you do, just let me know

506
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,854
how to get ahold of them.

507
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:27,080
Oh, Miss Connolly?

508
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,980
I'm thinking of having
a few people in my suite

509
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,080
for dinner tonight.

510
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,380
Would you care to join us?

511
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:34,050
- Oh, no, no thank you.

512
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,690
I have something I have to do.

513
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,160
- Oh.

514
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,383
Another time, maybe.

515
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:45,171
(upbeat, bumbly music)

516
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,005
- Nothing.

517
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,540
I can't believe it.

518
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,640
What happens to the days when
if you had a good novelty act,

519
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,927
everybody wanted you?

520
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,030
I'm not sure I have enough money to pay

521
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,590
for this room after tonight.

522
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:05,480
Better go down to the
office and see if the owner

523
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,840
can be sweet talked into being
a little more flexible until

524
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,683
we get work.

525
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,822
(soft music)

526
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,050
All right, kiddo.

527
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:22,150
It had been almost an
hour since the last time

528
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,310
I was humiliated, so I figured
I'd give Madame LaFarge

529
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,143
a chance.

530
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:30,460
- What kind of a rip off
are you trying to pull?

531
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,790
- I'm not trying to rip you off.

532
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,320
I just wanted to know if we could have a

533
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,197
few day's grace on our room.

534
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:39,431
- No pay, no stay.

535
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,744
(phone ringing)

536
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:43,070
- Okay, okay, I'll get the money.

537
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,730
- If you don't have 20 bucks
by check out time tomorrow,

538
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,040
you can take a hike,
and that goes for your

539
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,953
little pet, too.

540
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,894
- You knew about him?

541
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:53,727
- Him?

542
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,973
- Todd, Todd, this is for Archie.

543
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,860
- Oh, great, Archie loves apples.

544
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,870
- Well, actually, he tells
me that he prefers bugs,

545
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,970
but I don't carry those in my back pocket.

546
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,600
I heard Miss Spindell
yelling at you, what's wrong?

547
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,840
- Uh, she's afraid we're
gonna stiff her on the room.

548
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,673
- Oh, relax.

549
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,490
She thinks everybody's gonna stiff her.

550
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,220
- We're down to our last few bucks

551
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,520
and I can't find any work.

552
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,819
I've tried every club I could find.

553
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,143
Nobody wants us.

554
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:24,570
- Well you know what?

555
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,820
My brother.

556
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,030
He's a waiter at a little
club on the edge of town.

557
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,880
Maybe he can get you something there.

558
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:32,486
- Well, I've never worked as a waiter.

559
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,840
I guess I could learn.

560
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,593
- Not as a waiter, you
ding dong, as entertainers.

561
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:39,050
- You think they'd take us?

562
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,233
- Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask.

563
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,800
I'll call right now.

564
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,880
- Well, you know, that's
show business for you.

565
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,703
The next thing we knew, we were, uh,

566
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,650
well, you know, you could
say we were headlining this

567
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,433
incredible international revue.

568
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:04,724
(cheering)
(dramatic guitar music)

569
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:15,267
(cheering)
(upbeat mariachi music)

570
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:37,145
(upbeat mariachi music)
(man singing in Spanish)

571
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:20,376
(audience applause)
(cheering)

572
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:23,876
(man speaking in Spanish)

573
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:29,895
(audience applause)
(cheering)

574
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:43,873
(upbeat mariachi music)
(man singing in Spanish)

575
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:32,493
(audience applause)
(cheering)

576
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,717
(soft music)

577
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,950
Um, a margarita without salt and a glass

578
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,150
of water for me, please.

579
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,960
- Margarita without salt.

580
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,210
Now that's a good memory.

581
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:48,876
(soft music)

582
00:30:48,876 --> 00:30:53,150
- Well, sometimes, a good
memory can be a disadvantage.

583
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,000
- Where's Archie?

584
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,203
- Oh, he's taking a little nap.

585
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,190
Not as young as he used to be.

586
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:02,190
- Who is?

587
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,023
- Right.

588
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,383
So, how'd you find us?

589
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,239
- I just followed the
trail of banana peels.

590
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,072
(chuckles)

591
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:11,905
- No, seriously.

592
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:12,738
How'd you find us?

593
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,410
- I hit every club in the phone book,

594
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,290
and I showed them your photograph.

595
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,680
- Oh, I, uh, I would have
thought you'd be carrying

596
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,160
a photograph of that director I read about

597
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,793
you were living with a couple years ago.

598
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,490
- He didn't mean anything to me.

599
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,323
- Ah.

600
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,163
So, what are you doing here?

601
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,890
- Well I came to see if you and Archie

602
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,440
were as good as you used to be.

603
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:44,220
- And?

604
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,053
- You're not.

605
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:48,783
You're better.

606
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:51,004
(chuckles)

607
00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:52,760
Makes me wonder why you're
playing this small place

608
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,593
off the strip.

609
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,820
- Oh, uh.

610
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,873
We're doing a, a favor for a friend.

611
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,310
- You can make more working
in Chick Balton's revue.

612
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,030
- They don't need us.

613
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,450
- Oh, didn't you hear?

614
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,210
A couple of the variety acts fell out.

615
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,210
A flu, or something.

616
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,053
And they're really looking
for an act like yours.

617
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:18,030
- You know, maybe, you
know, Archie and I'll

618
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,530
check that out in the morning.

619
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,380
You know, who knows, we could wind up

620
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,000
sharing the same bill again.

621
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,973
This was my chance to make my move,

622
00:32:30,055 --> 00:32:33,520
or Archie was gonna have to
sleep in the car tonight.

623
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,010
- Well I probably should be going.

624
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,703
- Yeah, I probably should
be checking on Archie.

625
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,533
- Good night.

626
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:47,008
It was nice seeing you again.

627
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:51,000
- [Todd] Well you know,
you don't make a star like

628
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,053
Archie if you sleep in a car.

629
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,670
It just isn't done.

630
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,520
(upbeat, quirky music)

631
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:08,458
(knocking)

632
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,027
- What?

633
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,947
(upbeat, quirky music)

634
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,200
- The guy with the monkey is here.

635
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,033
- Right.

636
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,567
What's his name?

637
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:17,400
- Who?

638
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,771
- The guy.

639
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:19,688
- Oh, um...

640
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,403
Todd Wilson.

641
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,463
- Well tell him to come in.

642
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,970
- Balton was as tough as they come,

643
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,103
so I decided to let him know
who was calling the shots.

644
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,500
Hello again, Mr. Balton.

645
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,333
- Right.

646
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,161
Now here's the deal.

647
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:43,994
You start in the lounge, 800 a week.

648
00:33:43,994 --> 00:33:46,350
If you can cut it there,
you go right into the revue.

649
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,760
Greg will show you your dressing room,

650
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,360
give you your motel allowance,
and first week's pay.

651
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,553
- Uh, don't you wanna see us audition?

652
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,540
- What?

653
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,383
- Audition, you know, don't
you wanna see our act?

654
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,735
- I heard you were good,
that's all I need to know.

655
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,522
Now if you and your friend don't mind,

656
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:07,850
I've got a business to run here.

657
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,080
- Uh, thanks.

658
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,030
- Yeah.

659
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,000
- Uh, thanks.

660
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,833
Thanks a lot.

661
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:17,290
(people chattering)
(upbeat music)

662
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,123
Archie.

663
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,150
Didn't I tell ya?

664
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:24,795
(Archie vocalizes)

665
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,378
(upbeat music)

666
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:30,415
It seems if you've got real talent,

667
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:34,127
they treat you with respect.
(Archie vocalizes)

668
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:39,255
(upbeat, quirky music)

669
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,560
Now, you're sure this is
the dressing table you want?

670
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,910
Because there's no changing
your mind later on.

671
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,476
(Archie grunts)

672
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,580
Archie, I'll be back in a
few minutes once you make

673
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,523
up your mind.

674
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:09,848
(Archie vocalizes)

675
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:11,230
I figured Archie was old
enough for me to leave

676
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,300
him there with the champagne.

677
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,913
After all, in human
terms, he was, uh, 138?

678
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:25,443
(Archie vocalizes)

679
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:29,817
(people chattering)

680
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:40,856
(knocking)

681
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,553
Uh, Western Union.

682
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,880
- What's the message?

683
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,967
- Uh, the message is, uh,
"Thank you for the champagne,

684
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:59,967
"stop, and for tipping
me off to the job, stop."

685
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,340
- Your talent got you here, not me.

686
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:05,281
- Oh.

687
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,057
I brought you these.

688
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:11,474
(soft music)

689
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,160
- I remember the first time
you brought me daisies.

690
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,488
- Me, too.

691
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,020
- Well hell again Archie.

692
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,090
- Todd, Todd.

693
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,570
Archie's the one with the prehensile feet.

694
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,403
- Oh, good.

695
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,700
- What beautiful roses.

696
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,470
- The hotel likes to welcome its star in a

697
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,777
first class way.

698
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,320
Wait, I have something else for you.

699
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,070
Would you mind holding these, Arch?

700
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:40,332
(chuckles)

701
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,165
- Todd.

702
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,300
- I'll hold those for you.

703
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:47,028
- Thank you.

704
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,900
It's lovely.

705
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,078
It's a bird.

706
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:53,520
- Agapornis roseicollis,
the peach faced lovebird.

707
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,703
It's the showroom logo.

708
00:36:58,373 --> 00:36:59,206
- It's beautiful.

709
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,686
- A lovebird suits you.

710
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:03,850
Oh, I am being rude.

711
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,030
You have a rehearsal to get to.

712
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,800
Here, let me take these.

713
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,133
Shall I come in and put
these in a vase for you?

714
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,895
(machines rattling)
(bell ringing)

715
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,171
- So what kind of props do you need?

716
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:24,290
- Well I need two, two bar stools.

717
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, the kind with backs.

718
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,833
- Uh huh.

719
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:30,810
- And a dozen champagne
glasses, unbreakable, flexi,

720
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,280
and two bottles of sparkling apple juice.

721
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,113
- Okay.

722
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,020
I think that's everything.

723
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,840
- Um, how many people can this place hold?

724
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,190
- Oh on a good night, 200.

725
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,583
I'll see that your props
are set before the show.

726
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,277
- Come here, Arch, I
wanna show you somethin'.

727
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:54,170
(Archie vocalizing)

728
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,810
Okay Arch, don't be nervous.

729
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,302
There's nobody here.
(Archie vocalizes)

730
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:00,135
Well this is it.

731
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:02,480
This is the big room.

732
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,950
If we do okay in the lounge,

733
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,300
this would be our new home.

734
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,760
I wonder how many people it'll seat.

735
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,660
A thousand, maybe?

736
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:15,538
Geez.

737
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:18,163
A thousand people paying
40 bucks a head to see us.

738
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:20,108
(Archie vocalizes)

739
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:22,963
Okay, okay, us and some supporting acts.

740
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,393
Well, I guess this'll show
everybody we're not passe.

741
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:42,509
(footsteps approaching)

742
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:45,022
Decision time.

743
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:49,403
Beautiful, desirable woman
or three foot elderly chimp?

744
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,490
Arch, Archie, come here.

745
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,680
Why don't you sit here and make a drawing,

746
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,363
and I'm gonna talk to Laura.

747
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:04,374
(soft piano music)

748
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,360
Oh, that sounds familiar.

749
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,740
You think you can still
sing it in the key of C?

750
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,110
- Well my voice hasn't let me down yet.

751
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:21,520
- Good, 'cause that's the
only key I can play it in.

752
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,560
- Well I thought you
could play in all keys.

753
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,033
- I could, but, um, hunting accident.

754
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,108
It's not a pretty story.

755
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,296
(chuckles)

756
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:38,559

- Um.

792
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:14,117
Try this.

793
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,920
(soft piano music)

794
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,093
- You know, it hasn't been 15
years since I last saw you.

795
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,300
- It hasn't?

796
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,143
- No, I saw you five years
ago in Atlantic City.

797
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,180
Yeah, you were playing at
The Palace and Archie and I

798
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,180
were at the Million Dollar
Pier a couple of weeks

799
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,513
before it fell into the ocean.

800
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,660
- Oh, I remember that.

801
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,668
But I didn't know that you were there.

802
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:45,490
- And then after our show,
I'd run over to The Palace

803
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,790
and I'd sit in the balcony

804
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,200
and watch you sing.

805
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,113
Every night.

806
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,473
Well every night except the last night.

807
00:42:57,065 --> 00:43:00,880
I didn't go to the last
night 'cause I, I didn't.

808
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,905
I didn't want it to be over.

809
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:04,030
Remember the move I didn't make yesterday?

810
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,110
Well, this was the time.

811
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,973
You know, I never blamed
you for dumping me.

812
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,633
- What?

813
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:17,920
- Well I mean, who wouldn't have run out?

814
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,310
I mean, you were a
singer rising to stardom,

815
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,686
and what was I?

816
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,700
I was a novelty act.

817
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,400
- And that's why you think I left?

818
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,760
- Well let's face it,
I mean, I couldn't do

819
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,510
anything for you.

820
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,289
And then I read in the tabloids
that you were living with

821
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:37,290
a big time talent agent.

822
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,023
- He didn't mean anything to me.

823
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,670
- Well maybe not, but I, you
know, I figured you were,

824
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,710
you were doing what was
best for your career.

825
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,060
- Let me get this straight.

826
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,330
You think I'm the kind of
woman who dumps somebody

827
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,770
who can't help her career,
and then sleeps her way

828
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,793
to the top?

829
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,643
- I didn't say that.

830
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,660
- I'd stay away from
her if I were you, pal.

831
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,630
- Why?

832
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,340
- Well, she's the headliner
and you're just another

833
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,150
novelty act.

834
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,320
She's also a lady, and
you're a guy who rooms

835
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,683
with a chimpanzee.

836
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,513
And last but not least,

837
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:19,643
she's mine.

838
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,373
- Well you know, like I said before,

839
00:44:25,684 --> 00:44:28,803
you don't make a big star
like Archie sleep in a car.

840
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:34,468
(soft piano music)

841
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:47,043
I don't know maybe, maybe Chick
Balton was pulling my chain?

842
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:49,660
It's just that he doesn't
seem like the type

843
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,823
that Laura would go for.

844
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,320
Yeah, you're right.

845
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:01,893
What difference does it make?

846
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,693
That was 15 years ago,
and I'm blowing it now.

847
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:13,231
(people chattering)

848
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,460
Always be nice to the kitchen help.

849
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,505
It can mean the difference
between a hamburger,

850
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:21,613
and a porterhouse steak.
(Archie vocalizes)

851
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:25,758
- Excuse me?

852
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:27,300
You can't bring that monkey in here.

853
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,750
- Well why not?

854
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,703
He's an employee just like you.

855
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:32,250
- Hard to think he's just like me.

856
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,800
- I'll take that back, you're right.

857
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,830
He's got a personality.
(workers laughing)

858
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,080
- Hey, hey.

859
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,650
It's okay, I know these guys.

860
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,710
I saw you two at El Toro Rojo.

861
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,612
You were really good man.

862
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,757
(workers agreeing)

863
00:45:47,757 --> 00:45:48,798
- You hear that Arch?

864
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:49,860
A fan. (chuckles)

865
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,064
- The fact remains that I
can't allow him in here.

866
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,826
- Hey look, you're in
charge out there, all right?

867
00:45:54,826 --> 00:45:55,765
And I'm in charge back here.

868
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,598
Now, you wanna argue with us?

869
00:45:57,598 --> 00:46:00,515
(workers agreeing)

870
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,103
- Did I tell you about Archie's ice trick?

871
00:46:08,054 --> 00:46:10,670
(man yells)

872
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:15,670
(workers laughing)
(upbeat, quirky music)

873
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,590
(machines rattling)
(people chattering)

874
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:39,365
Okay, Archie, which one of
these machines looks like

875
00:46:39,365 --> 00:46:40,913
it's ready to cough up some dollars?

876
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:43,965
(Archie vocalizes)

877
00:46:43,965 --> 00:46:46,339
(people laughing)

878
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:47,172
Okay, I'll tell you what.

879
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,633
I'll take this one and
you find one for yourself.

880
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,710
(people laughing)

881
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,467
No, no, no, no.
(people laughing)

882
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,360
Archie, I told you, this is mine.

883
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,163
You find one for yourself.
(people laughing)

884
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:08,249
- You've been putting on shows here

885
00:47:08,249 --> 00:47:10,301
as long as I've run this place.

886
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:11,450
But a chimp act?

887
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,264
- I have my doubts, too, but

888
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,863
if it keeps the star happy, it's worth it.

889
00:47:15,863 --> 00:47:18,358
(people laughing)

890
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:19,598
- What's going on here?

891
00:47:19,598 --> 00:47:20,431
- Archie, I told you.

892
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:24,882
Wait until I put a dollar in.
(people laughing)

893
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:26,839
- He's funneling, can you believe it?

894
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:27,672
What does he think this is?

895
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:28,690
The Catskills?

896
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,086
- Pull, Archie.

897
00:47:30,086 --> 00:47:31,730
All the way.

898
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,670
Archie was a shrewd gambler.

899
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,307
His trick was that

900
00:47:36,698 --> 00:47:37,970
he had this poker face.

901
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:41,333
You know, you just couldn't
tell what he was thinking.

902
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:49,645
(cheering)
(machine ringing)

903
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,330
- They seem to love it.

904
00:47:56,495 --> 00:48:00,355
(cheering)
(machine ringing)

905
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:03,272
- Okay, okay Archie, that's enough.

906
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,085
Let's go home and we'll put
this in your piggy bank.

907
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,651
(people laughing)

908
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:09,954
Archie, ladies and gentlemen.

909
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:13,446
Todd and Archie, we'll see
you at the lounge tonight.

910
00:48:13,446 --> 00:48:18,446
(cheering)
(upbeat, quirky music)

911
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:21,721
(knocking)

912
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:24,000
Things were going so well, it was time to

913
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,793
straighten things out with Laura.

914
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,150
- Todd.

915
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,543
- Can I, can I come in?

916
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,073
- Sure.

917
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,367
- Look, Laura.

918
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:40,930
I know you hate my guts.

919
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,963
- I don't hate you.

920
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:45,490
- Well that's sure what
it sounded like yesterday.

921
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,833
- Yesterday you implied
that I ran out on you.

922
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,990
- Well maybe I'm crazy, but,
you know receiving a postcard

923
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,360
from New York saying,
"Good bye, don't call me."

924
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,060
It just might possibly be construed as

925
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,173
running out on a guy.

926
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,833
Laura?

927
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,270
I asked you to marry me.

928
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,080
- Three times.

929
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,520
But each time before we
could actually get married,

930
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,160
you and Archie disappeared.

931
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,060
- Paying gigs.

932
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,370
I mean, you knew we always
went where the work was.

933
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,253
- Oh, I know.

934
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,200
It was always legitimate.

935
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,340
It was always work.

936
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,103
But after the third time,

937
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,630
I knew that you were
never going to go through

938
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,480
with the wedding.

939
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,433
Face the facts.

940
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,533
You have used Archie to
avoid making a commitment,

941
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,073
to a viable career,

942
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,293
or to a person.

943
00:49:46,138 --> 00:49:46,971
(sighs)

944
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:47,960
- Laura.

945
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,793
I loved you.

946
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,050
- I know.

947
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,200
But you didn't need me.

948
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,700
I know that because every time we'd start

949
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,530
to get close together,
you'd find an excuse to

950
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,523
stay away from me.

951
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,743
- Look.

952
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,303
Is there any way to make this thing right?

953
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,403
- Maybe we could start by
going to get a cup of coffee?

954
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,553
- I, I have to go.

955
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,100
- I don't believe this.

956
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,940
- We have a rehearsal.

957
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,600
- This is a rerun of 15 years ago.

958
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,130
- We can have a coffee right after--

959
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,770
- Get out!

960
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,250
Get out of here, Todd
Wilson, before I scream.

961
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,250
- You are screaming.

962
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,420
- Get out.

963
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,920
Out!

964
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,310
Get out!

965
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,190
- [Todd] I know you don't believe me but

966
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:47,251
I used to be a terrific straightener.

967
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:50,448
- Damn him.

968
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,100
- Archie and I always did the same things

969
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,443
to get ready for a show.

970
00:50:57,503 --> 00:51:00,373
The only difference was that I shaved.

971
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:05,832
Look good.
(Archie vocalizes)

972
00:51:08,255 --> 00:51:11,172
(Archie vocalizes)

973
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,297
Sound good.
(Archie vocalizes)

974
00:51:17,297 --> 00:51:19,547
(gurgling)

975
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,753
Smell good.
(Archie vocalizes)

976
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:36,839
And, feel good.

977
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:41,260
Come on, there we go.

978
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,260
Okay, let's go out and kill 'em, Archie.

979
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:45,585
Come on.

980
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:47,840
Come on.
(Archie vocalizing)

981
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,350
- [Announcer] And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

982
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,420
please put your hands
together, and extend a hearty

983
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,450
Las Vegas to that hilarious twosome,

984
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,118
Todd and Archie.

985
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:02,951
(applause)
(upbeat music)

986
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:06,414
- Thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen.

987
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:10,260
Archie and I would like
to start off our show.

988
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,443
Archie?
(audience laughs)

989
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,813
Where is Archie?
(audience laughs)

990
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:22,445
(upbeat music)

991
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:32,794
(applause)
(laughing)

992
00:52:32,794 --> 00:52:34,269
Archie, would you mind coming up here?

993
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:36,119
I want you up here right this minute.

994
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,954
(audience laughs)

995
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,020
Archie, it's time to start
the show, now stop that.

996
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,373
(audience laughs)

997
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,880
Archie, do you realize
that that lady's husband

998
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,310
is seated right next to her?

999
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,360
What is he gonna say?

1000
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:04,966
(audience laughs)
(applause)

1001
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:05,799
Archie.

1002
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:11,127
(audience applause)

1003
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:22,546
(audience applause)

1004
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:24,600
Archie, I'm glad you decided to join me.

1005
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,200
Maybe now we can start the show.

1006
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:28,399
You know, ladies and gentlemen,

1007
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:30,633
believe it or not, Archie is
an expert charades players.

1008
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:32,780
And to demonstrate his uncanny ability,

1009
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,440
just before the show,
Archie and a stagehand

1010
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,130
chose a member of our
audience, completely at random,

1011
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,600
to select a title.

1012
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,130
I'm gonna try to guess
that title based solely

1013
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,113
on the clues given to me by Archie.

1014
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:49,886
All right, Archie, you wanna
show the card to the audience?

1015
00:53:49,886 --> 00:53:50,719
(audience laughs)

1016
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,900
You're right, you're right.

1017
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,690
(audience chattering)

1018
00:53:59,815 --> 00:54:02,065
(clapping)

1019
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,103
Okay, I'm ready when you are, Arch.

1020
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:07,751
(Archie vocalizing)

1021
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:08,584
A song.

1022
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:14,278
Six words in the title.

1023
00:54:16,397 --> 00:54:17,314
First word.

1024
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:19,195
Eyes.

1025
00:54:20,697 --> 00:54:21,530
Eyeballs.

1026
00:54:22,455 --> 00:54:25,430
The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You.

1027
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,347
Angel eyes?

1028
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:31,180
You can't hide your lying eyes.

1029
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,273
Blind as a one-eyed sailor.

1030
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:39,236
(audience laughs)

1031
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,305
Uh, a vision.

1032
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:43,646
Uh, sight.

1033
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:44,734
Uh, eyes.

1034
00:54:44,734 --> 00:54:45,625
I?

1035
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:50,625
I.
(audience applause)

1036
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,543
Second word.

1037
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,013
Uh, second word.

1038
00:54:57,013 --> 00:54:57,846
Sounds like.

1039
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,313
Meandering.

1040
00:55:02,343 --> 00:55:03,176
You're meandering.

1041
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:05,300
You're walking.

1042
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,753
I'm walking the float
over to you, thank you.

1043
00:55:07,753 --> 00:55:08,586
No?

1044
00:55:08,586 --> 00:55:10,505
Okay, all right.

1045
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:12,054
A walk on the wild side.

1046
00:55:12,054 --> 00:55:13,692
Walk, don't run.

1047
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:16,030
Uh, I'd walk the entire world for just

1048
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:17,333
one dance with you.

1049
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,510
Roving, you're roving.

1050
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,087
You're roaming in the gloaming.

1051
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,087
(audience exclaims)

1052
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,830
You're wandering.

1053
00:55:29,227 --> 00:55:31,879
Sounds like, sounds like wander.

1054
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:32,712
Wandering?

1055
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,205
Wander.

1056
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:38,762
Sounds like wander, wonder.

1057
00:55:38,762 --> 00:55:40,411
I wonder.

1058
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:43,462
Oh, this is easy.
(audience applause)

1059
00:55:43,462 --> 00:55:45,777
I wonder what time it is.

1060
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:50,777
No?
(audience laughs)

1061
00:55:51,562 --> 00:55:56,562
(Archie vocalizing)
(audience laughing)

1062
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:02,229
I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now?

1063
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:07,229
(Archie vocalizes)
(upbeat music)

1064
00:56:08,012 --> 00:56:12,845
(applause)
(upbeat music)

1065
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,458
(Todd drowned out by applause)

1066
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:29,024
(upbeat music)
(applause)

1067
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:33,949
(applause)

1068
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:37,434
- Boy, I tell you, you two
were just wonderful tonight.

1069
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:40,548
(workers agreeing)

1070
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:42,063
- Well, we had a great audience.

1071
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:45,880
Archie, go easy there.

1072
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,693
- It's okay, let him have
fun, it's a celebration.

1073
00:56:48,693 --> 00:56:49,619
(workers agreeing)

1074
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:51,120
- I don't want his
cholesterol to celebrate

1075
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,595
breaking the 300 mark.
(laughing)

1076
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:55,590
No, no, no listen.

1077
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,430
Chimps get exactly the
same diseases that we get.

1078
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,400
- Hey Archie.

1079
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,970
Archie, your partner doesn't
want you to have any fun.

1080
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,670
What to you think about that, huh?

1081
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:08,557
(Archie blows raspberry)
(workers laughing)

1082
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,690
- You saw with your own eyes,
they killed the audience.

1083
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,210
I want them in the revue.

1084
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,920
- They're making great
money in the lounge.

1085
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,020
Why don't we just leave well enough alone?

1086
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:20,440
- We had a deal.

1087
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,766
- Well, we didn't have
anything in writing,

1088
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:24,660
and your contract for the show was signed,

1089
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,223
sealed, and delivered.

1090
00:57:28,418 --> 00:57:33,168
(clears throat)
(coughs)

1091
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,090
What's the matter?

1092
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,250
- Laryngitis.
(clears throat)

1093
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,083
- What?

1094
00:57:41,287 --> 00:57:42,884
(coughs)

1095
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:45,980
- It could be weeks before
I can sing again. (coughs)

1096
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,155
- I don't believe this.

1097
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:50,238
- Believe it.

1098
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:02,300
(beeping)

1099
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,280
- [Greg] Yes, Mr. Balton?

1100
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,860
- Greg, tell that Todd
Wilson and his chimpanzee

1101
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,910
they're in the revue.

1102
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,903
- After my spot.

1103
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,958
- After Miss Connolly's number.

1104
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,820
- [Greg] Yes, sir.

1105
00:58:21,556 --> 00:58:24,606
(phone ringing)

1106
00:58:24,606 --> 00:58:25,930
- I hate it when the phone wakes me up,

1107
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:29,440
but over the years I've
developed a clever way

1108
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,513
to answer.

1109
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,823
Hello?

1110
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,393
Oh, hi Greg.

1111
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:40,140
Uh, sure I can meet him at three o'clock.

1112
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,333
Thank you, good bye.

1113
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,733
1:30?

1114
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,483
Day time 1:30?

1115
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:52,703
Come on, get up Arch, we've
slept away half the day.

1116
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,860
Yeah, you're right.

1117
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,710
We're both too old to be partying until

1118
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,760
three in the morning.

1119
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,885
(people chattering)

1120
00:59:02,885 --> 00:59:04,620
- Just remember, you're
working for me, not for them.

1121
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,403
They should go home
happy, but not too rich.

1122
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:09,910
(Chick clears throat)

1123
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,140
- Take a break.

1124
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,570
Todd, this is Mr. Cadwell,
the president of the hotel.

1125
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,490
- Oh, great to meet you.

1126
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,877
And thanks for the shot at the main room.

1127
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:21,930
Archie and I, we won't let you down.

1128
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,574
- I understand this is your first time

1129
00:59:23,574 --> 00:59:25,017
in a big showroom.

1130
00:59:25,017 --> 00:59:26,680
- First time, yeah.

1131
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,513
- Well things are different
from the way they are

1132
00:59:27,513 --> 00:59:28,814
in the lounge.

1133
00:59:28,814 --> 00:59:30,943
- Mr. Cadwell heard
you worked chimp loose.

1134
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,390
- Well, I let Archie, uh, I let Archie go

1135
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:39,280
and find funny bits, if
that's what he means.

1136
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,957
But if the crowd laughs
and Archie leaves it in,

1137
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:43,810
you know, it's always
worked for us in the past.

1138
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,360
- No, not here in the big room.

1139
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,800
(people chattering)
(machines rattling)

1140
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,457
- We're saying you gotta
tighten up your act.

1141
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,650
I mean, you work the animal
lose, you're on stage what,

1142
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,990
five, six, seven minutes.

1143
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,514
You never know.

1144
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:58,557
- Well you know, we've
never overstayed our welcome

1145
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:00,357
as far as the audience is concerned.

1146
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,070
- Now, you're gonna be on

1147
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,503
four minutes, exactly.

1148
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,180
- You're putting a stopwatch on us?

1149
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,970
- The casino has a
hundred dealers lined up

1150
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:15,350
outside the room, just
waiting for that crowd.

1151
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,773
Every minute you go over, costs me.

1152
01:00:19,435 --> 01:00:20,268
- Explain that to Archie.

1153
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:22,250
- No, no, no, no, we're gonna tell you.

1154
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,260
You wanna play that showroom,
or you wanna hang around

1155
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,460
waiting for Ed Sullivan
to get reincarnated?

1156
01:00:28,596 --> 01:00:31,698
- I better get started if
I'm gonna trim the act.

1157
01:00:31,698 --> 01:00:32,531
- Another thing.

1158
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:35,420
Teach that monkey some new tricks.

1159
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,253
We don't want people to
think they're seeing some

1160
01:00:36,253 --> 01:00:38,593
warmed over lounge act
at a Chick Balton revue.

1161
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:42,720
- You know, Archie isn't
as young as he used to be.

1162
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,263
New tricks come hard.

1163
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:47,660
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

1164
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,837
- I heard you.

1165
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,903
New tricks.

1166
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:54,180
(people chattering)

1167
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,013
- Animal acts.

1168
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:59,875
(soft piano music)

1169
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:04,490
- Archie, what's the matter with you?

1170
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,550
We're never gonna finish
the routine on time

1171
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,453
if you stroll around the piano.

1172
01:01:12,173 --> 01:01:13,210
As soon as I start to play the piano,

1173
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,690
you steal the music and
run around the piano.

1174
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:16,863
Run, don't walk.

1175
01:01:17,772 --> 01:01:19,401
Now, go.

1176
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:22,318
(soft piano music)

1177
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,000
Who told you to sit and read the music?

1178
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,760
Look, stop adding new gags.

1179
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,123
All you have to do is
grab the music and run.

1180
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:41,690
I mean, is that so hard?

1181
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,373
Just, screw your little
chimpanzee head on right.

1182
01:01:45,215 --> 01:01:47,363
All right, get back here
and let's do it again.

1183
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,920
Now, I start to play
the piano, and you run

1184
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,360
around the piano, understand?

1185
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,692
Run.

1186
01:01:57,692 --> 01:01:58,710
Fast.

1187
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,834
Go.
(soft piano music)

1188
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:04,834
(Archie vocalizing)

1189
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:09,290
The music, you forgot the music.

1190
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,450
(Archie vocalizing)

1191
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:13,463
Look, Arch.

1192
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,263
We were only gonna be on
for four minutes, but I, uh,

1193
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:21,347
had a feeling it was gonna
be a long four minutes.

1194
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,290
(soft piano music)

1195
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,724
How are you doing, kiddo?

1196
01:02:32,724 --> 01:02:34,710
(Archie vocalizes)

1197
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,123
Look, I, I know I've been
pushing you too hard, but,

1198
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,743
I mean, we're so close.

1199
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:45,247
And you know, I just,
I want us to be great.

1200
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,570
(knocking)

1201
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:47,403
Come in.

1202
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,810
- Hi, what you doin'?

1203
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,910
- Oh, we're just taking
a breather, you know,

1204
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:55,963
between rehearsals.

1205
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,450
- Mr. Balton wants to know
how the new routine's comin'.

1206
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,390
- Fine, fine.

1207
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,283
Archie's taken to the new
material like when he was a kid.

1208
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:08,500
You know, we just have to
shave off a few seconds

1209
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,003
off the act, that's all.

1210
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:13,120
- You'll have him ready
by tomorrow morning?

1211
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:13,960
- Tomorrow morning?

1212
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,793
Uh.

1213
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,270
Dress rehearsal's not for two days.

1214
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,970
- Mr. Balton wants to see a run through,

1215
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,320
in the morning, 10 o'clock.

1216
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:24,850
He needs time in case we
need to find a replacement.

1217
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,193
- We'll be ready.

1218
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:36,008
(door closes)

1219
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,295
Archie and I would now like
to do a piano duet for you.

1220
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:42,430
It's a very special number.

1221
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:45,040
It's Archie's favorite,
as a matter of fact.

1222
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,313
Debussy's Afternoon of a Fawn.

1223
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:50,060
Archie, you play the left hand part,

1224
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,713
and would you turn the pages, please?

1225
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:57,210
(soft piano music)

1226
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:11,662
Would you turn the pages, please?

1227
01:04:14,412 --> 01:04:15,250
(Archie grunts)

1228
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,040
It's that old football injury...

1229
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,450
You know how sometimes
you get this feeling

1230
01:04:22,678 --> 01:04:24,543
that things aren't going well?

1231
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:26,708
Go.

1232
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:29,730
Anyway, the gag is that he,

1233
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:30,993
he steals the music.

1234
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:36,751
And he runs around the piano.

1235
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,610
- Put a call into Atlantic City.

1236
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,003
Tell 'em I want a backup act standing by.

1237
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,293
- Well, how come?

1238
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,473
You put us in the show 'cause
you knew we had talent.

1239
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,510
- I put you in the show
because Laura Connolly

1240
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,283
busted my chops until I did.

1241
01:04:57,696 --> 01:05:01,613
(soft, melancholy piano music)

1242
01:05:06,587 --> 01:05:08,272
(people chattering)

1243
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:09,320
- And here I thought we
made it into the revue

1244
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,710
on our talent.

1245
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,570
Now I find out that Laura's
been using her influence

1246
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,940
with Chick Balton.

1247
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,440
- Well what's wrong with that?

1248
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,682
- What's wrong with that?

1249
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:20,760
I mean, I'm humiliated.

1250
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,720
That's what's wrong with that.

1251
01:05:22,621 --> 01:05:23,910
- Well feel what you like.

1252
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:27,250
But if it was me, I'd be proud.

1253
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,470
Okay, so who cares how you got the job,

1254
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:34,233
as long as you know that you
got the talent to do the job.

1255
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:38,580
I mean, uh, would you feel any
better if some high powered

1256
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:42,483
agent strong armed Chick Balton
into giving you the shot?

1257
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:47,100
Second, if a lady went out
on a limb like that for me,

1258
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,867
I don't care what her reasons are.

1259
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,223
I'd feel good.

1260
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,743
It means she cares about me.

1261
01:05:57,337 --> 01:05:59,970
(soft piano music)

1262
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,810
- You really, you really think so?

1263
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,573
- A shoe man never lies.

1264
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:08,575
- I've never heard that expression.

1265
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:09,530
(Archie vocalizes)

1266
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,491
Well, Archie and I have a rehearsal.

1267
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:12,591
We'd better get goin'.

1268
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:17,070
(soft piano music)

1269
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,320
- How is Archibald doin'?

1270
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,060
Looks a little pinkish.

1271
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,150
- Oh, we, uh, he's okay.

1272
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:26,193
We've been working a little
hard, but he's a real trooper.

1273
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:30,150
Come on, Archie.
(Archie vocalizes)

1274
01:06:31,861 --> 01:06:36,861
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

1275
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:44,350
There's something about being
backstage before a show.

1276
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,183
It's exciting.

1277
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,473
It's invigorating but for some reason,

1278
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:52,386
I was getting nauseous.

1279
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,070
Oh, listen, listen to that Archie.

1280
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,620
They've got the full
orchestra for dress rehearsal.

1281
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,110
- That's the cue for Laura's final number.

1282
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,430
You're on next.
- We know, we know.

1283
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,203
- Oh, okay, okay.

1284
01:07:05,203 --> 01:07:06,500
- All right, Arch, a
couple more performances

1285
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,380
and you'll know the cues better than I do.

1286
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,363
You always do.

1287
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,820
All right, give us a kiss.

1288
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:16,703
I'm not going out there without a kiss.

1289
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:24,707
All right, look sharp.

1290
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:27,418
Ladies.

1291
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:32,107
(Archie cries out)

1292
01:07:32,107 --> 01:07:34,190
Archie?

1293
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:35,023
Archie?

1294
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,323
- What's going on?

1295
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:39,030
- Get an ambulance.
- What?

1296
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:39,863
- Get an ambulance.

1297
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:40,696
Get it, now!

1298
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:46,595
It's gonna be all right.

1299
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,129
It's gonna be all right.

1300
01:07:49,129 --> 01:07:52,513
- [Man] All right, look out,
coming through, coming through.

1301
01:07:52,513 --> 01:07:54,460
- There's an animal hospital
on 17th, we'll take him there.

1302
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,293
- Hang on, pal.

1303
01:07:57,847 --> 01:08:00,514
(radio chatter)

1304
01:08:02,593 --> 01:08:04,450
(sirens blaring)

1305
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,723
If I ever had a lower moment in my life,

1306
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:09,730
I don't remember.

1307
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,463
(beeping)

1308
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:18,881
- He's had a stroke.

1309
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:23,978
- Was, was there any way to know?

1310
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:25,300
I mean, is there anything that I--

1311
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,170
- These things happen, Mr. Wilson.

1312
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,720
There's no way to predict when.

1313
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,290
- Will he recover?

1314
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,393
- He's old.

1315
01:08:39,626 --> 01:08:44,626
(beeping)
(slow, melancholy music)

1316
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:56,998
- Hi.

1317
01:08:58,042 --> 01:08:58,875
- Hi.

1318
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,471
- How is he?

1319
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:04,673
- His left side if paralyzed.

1320
01:09:07,106 --> 01:09:08,120
The doctor doesn't know what.

1321
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:16,370
- Why don't you let me
take you back to the motel?

1322
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,333
- How can I go back to that room and,

1323
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:21,537
and look at his little bed?

1324
01:09:21,537 --> 01:09:22,837
No, I think I'll say here.

1325
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,040
- Well you can't do any--

1326
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,753
- I said I'm going to stay here.

1327
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:37,643
I'm sorry.

1328
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,653
I shouldn't take it out on you.

1329
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:46,530
It's just that, we were so close.

1330
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,783
- [Laura] I know you were.

1331
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,833
- Besides, you probably wanna
get back to Chick Balton.

1332
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,740
- Why?

1333
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:59,283
- He said that, that you
were seeing each other.

1334
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,093
- Well he lied.

1335
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,304
- Laura, it's okay.

1336
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:06,330
I mean, I know that
you used your influence

1337
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,763
to get Archie and I into the show.

1338
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,320
- For the past 10 years,
I've worked nearly every

1339
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,683
showroom on the strip.

1340
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,963
And I have a lot of
clout as an entertainer.

1341
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,900
Professional clout, and
that's exactly what I

1342
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,050
used with Chick Balton.

1343
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:28,015
- Oh.

1344
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:31,364
I thought...

1345
01:10:38,052 --> 01:10:41,332
(soft piano music)

1346
01:10:41,332 --> 01:10:43,999
- Come on, let me take you home.

1347
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,124
(soft piano music)

1348
01:10:57,237 --> 01:11:00,154
(soft jazzy music)

1349
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:54,617
(people chattering)

1350
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:03,550
(soft jazzy music)

1351
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,013
- What is this?

1352
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:30,670
- Say hello to Terrance.

1353
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,240
He belonged to an Englishman who lost

1354
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,390
all his money gambling.

1355
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,700
- No.

1356
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,200
- But in England, he used
to play the music halls.

1357
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:42,940
- You're talking about Archie
like he's dead or somethin'.

1358
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,610
I mean he's gonna get
better and when he does,

1359
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,423
he's gonna be my partner again.

1360
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,163
- Oh, Archie is gonna get better.

1361
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,170
But, don't let it blow
your one chance to do

1362
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:56,050
what you told me you've
always wanted to do.

1363
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:58,083
That's to play a showroom in Las Vegas.

1364
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:01,540
And I think that Archie
might like at least

1365
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,090
one of you to have that chance.

1366
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,260
Terrance isn't going to replace Archie.

1367
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,093
He's a temp.

1368
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,380
They say he's quick.

1369
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:14,473
Watch this.

1370
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,573
Terrance, turn on the TV.

1371
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,833
Look.

1372
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:26,202
The TV?

1373
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,858
(clicking)

1374
01:13:35,895 --> 01:13:37,562
It could work, Todd.

1375
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:39,423
- What about Chick Balton?

1376
01:13:41,745 --> 01:13:45,037
- Let me take care of him.
(Terrance vocalizing)

1377
01:13:46,161 --> 01:13:49,078
(soft jazzy music)

1378
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,594
(knocking)

1379
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:57,797
- Come on.

1380
01:13:57,797 --> 01:13:59,324
(knocking)

1381
01:13:59,324 --> 01:14:01,074
All right, all right.

1382
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:03,428
Oh, hello.

1383
01:14:03,428 --> 01:14:04,261
- Hello.

1384
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:06,877
I'd like to speak to
you about Todd Wilson.

1385
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,990
- Sorry about his chimpanzee.

1386
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,380
Now Greg will take care
of their severance.

1387
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,930
Normally we'd give a week, but,

1388
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:15,550
I'll see they get two.

1389
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:16,600
- He has a new chimp.

1390
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:21,130
- I got a replacement act
flying in from Atlantic City.

1391
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,900
Now the deal is set.

1392
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,500
- Then unset it.

1393
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,860
- No.

1394
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,100
You've been jerking me around
about this guy for a week,

1395
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,000
now he's out of the show.

1396
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,810
And don't try pulling that
laryngitis crap on me, either.

1397
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,610
You've got a contract, and if you try to

1398
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:37,310
break that contract, I'll
have my lawyers all over ya,

1399
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:39,323
like cloves on a ham, you understand?

1400
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,703
- I understand.

1401
01:14:45,036 --> 01:14:46,203
It's just too bad, though.

1402
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:50,268
- What's too bad?

1403
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:52,568
- Well, I was just
starting to warm up to you.

1404
01:15:00,636 --> 01:15:02,750
- What do you mean warm up?

1405
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,300
- Well, I thought we'd
start by going to dinner

1406
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,450
tonight after the show.

1407
01:15:08,728 --> 01:15:09,561
- And?

1408
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:11,753
- Well I'm not the kind of girl
who kisses on the first date

1409
01:15:11,753 --> 01:15:14,923
so we might have to go to
dinner every night this week.

1410
01:15:19,996 --> 01:15:22,990
(clapping)

1411
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:26,546
- Now, we'd like to play
a piano duet for you,

1412
01:15:26,546 --> 01:15:27,379
you nice people.

1413
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,133
You did, you did bring the music?

1414
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:32,980
(Terrance vocalizes)

1415
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,143
Well, where is it?

1416
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,430
(Terrance vocalizes)

1417
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,647
(laughs)

1418
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:40,313
Remember Archie used to
do that when he was a kid?

1419
01:15:42,442 --> 01:15:43,275
He is quick.

1420
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,992
All right, I'll play the first movement,

1421
01:15:46,992 --> 01:15:48,109
and you play the second.

1422
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:49,400
I'm sure all the people are anxious to see

1423
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,313
our premiere performance
of Moonlight Sonata.

1424
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,904
Are you ready?
(Terrance vocalizes)

1425
01:15:55,904 --> 01:15:56,737
Fine.

1426
01:15:58,037 --> 01:16:00,954
(soft piano music)

1427
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:04,903
How am I supposed to play my
part if you turn the page?

1428
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,730
(soft piano music)

1429
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,563
Time?

1430
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,683
- Four minute, 30 seconds, on the button.

1431
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:15,760
- Great.

1432
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,303
Good boy, go get some juice.
(Terrance vocalizes)

1433
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:23,013
- You two are gonna be great.

1434
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:25,008
- Maybe.

1435
01:16:28,356 --> 01:16:32,150
I just, I just wish it was
Archie up there with me.

1436
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:33,830
- Don't start.

1437
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,610
If Archie could talk,
he'd tell you you're doing

1438
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,260
exactly what you should be doing.

1439
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:43,523
- Come on.

1440
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,120
Oh, thank you, Terrance.

1441
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:47,953
Thank you.

1442
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:57,314
Hi, hi Arch.

1443
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:04,092
Oh, where'd you get the nice flowers?

1444
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:09,453
Have you got a girl on the
side I don't know about?

1445
01:17:13,659 --> 01:17:14,955
"Dear Archie, get well soon.

1446
01:17:14,955 --> 01:17:16,417
"Love, Rosalita."

1447
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,853
Well that's very sweet.

1448
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:25,362
You know, don't ya?

1449
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,023
He's good.

1450
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,050
He's young, he's very good.

1451
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,233
Not as good as you.

1452
01:17:36,991 --> 01:17:39,403
But you know, when you're over this thing,

1453
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:41,913
we'll sit him down,

1454
01:17:43,937 --> 01:17:46,183
and you'll be right back
where you should be.

1455
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,623
Archie and Todd together.

1456
01:17:52,817 --> 01:17:53,650
I promise.

1457
01:17:59,302 --> 01:18:02,340
(audience applause)
(cheering)

1458
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:05,950
- Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Grand Showroom.

1459
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,930
Tonight we are proud to present the

1460
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:12,884
25th Anniversary edition
of the Chick Balton Revue.

1461
01:18:12,884 --> 01:18:14,970
(audience applause)
(cheering)

1462
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:17,217
- Not exactly the Gettysburg Address,

1463
01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:18,417
but that's a show start.

1464
01:18:21,707 --> 01:18:23,924
Well, Chip was in a great mood.

1465
01:18:23,924 --> 01:18:27,257
He even have himself a standing ovation.

1466
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,623
Okay, now, we can't go out there with our

1467
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:32,323
faces looking like lumps of dough.

1468
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,333
We need

1469
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:37,479
features.

1470
01:18:39,265 --> 01:18:41,015
Okay, your turn you handsome devil.

1471
01:18:43,377 --> 01:18:47,210
(upbeat electronic pop music)

1472
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:05,179
Look good.
(Terrance vocalizes)

1473
01:19:07,128 --> 01:19:10,961
(upbeat electronic pop music)

1474
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:29,054
(audience exclaims)

1475
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:30,630
(applause)
(cheering)

1476
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:34,440
Sound good.
(Terrance vocalizes)

1477
01:19:37,204 --> 01:19:40,073
(slurps)

1478
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:42,629
(chuckles)

1479
01:19:42,629 --> 01:19:47,629
(upbeat electronic pop music)
(clapping)

1480
01:20:09,616 --> 01:20:11,946
(audience exclaims)

1481
01:20:11,946 --> 01:20:13,072
- If this act doesn't get any better,

1482
01:20:13,072 --> 01:20:16,460
I'm gonna make 'em both disappear.

1483
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:21,460
- Smell good.
(Terrance vocalizes)

1484
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:27,571
(upbeat electronic pop music)

1485
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:30,173
(audience applause)

1486
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,673
- Backstage, Greg.

1487
01:20:33,773 --> 01:20:36,443
I'll put you through to his dressing room.

1488
01:20:37,594 --> 01:20:38,427
Laura?

1489
01:20:39,365 --> 01:20:41,087
It's an emergency at the vet's.

1490
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:42,254
It's for Todd.

1491
01:20:43,183 --> 01:20:44,077
- Don't put it though.

1492
01:20:47,997 --> 01:20:48,830
Yes?

1493
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,780
I'll make sure he's told, thank you.

1494
01:20:56,728 --> 01:21:01,728
- And feel good.
(Terrance vocalizes)

1495
01:21:02,517 --> 01:21:06,290
This is the part where
Archie always gave me a hug.

1496
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:10,023
We always hugged before we'd go on.

1497
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:16,923
(upbeat electronic pop music)

1498
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:21,170
- Tell the lighting man to
hold that spotlight steady.

1499
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:22,990
And see that he drinks decaf tomorrow.

1500
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,702
Where's the chimp act?

1501
01:21:24,702 --> 01:21:25,535
He should be out here.

1502
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:27,202
- I'm here.

1503
01:21:27,202 --> 01:21:28,035
- Well, it's about damn time.

1504
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:30,278
Laura's cue is coming up and
you're on right after her.

1505
01:21:30,278 --> 01:21:31,111
Where's the monkey?

1506
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:33,526
- I'm afraid I won't be going on tonight.

1507
01:21:33,526 --> 01:21:35,128
- What?

1508
01:21:35,128 --> 01:21:36,117
(drum roll)

1509
01:21:36,117 --> 01:21:37,431
- There's your cue, kiddo.

1510
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:38,264
Break a leg.

1511
01:21:38,264 --> 01:21:39,097
- Thanks.

1512
01:21:39,097 --> 01:21:41,972
- What the hell do you mean
you won't be going on tonight?

1513
01:21:41,972 --> 01:21:44,040
- I only wish Archie were here to see it.

1514
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,073
- [Chick] You're missing your cue, go on.

1515
01:21:47,094 --> 01:21:47,927
- I can't.

1516
01:21:47,927 --> 01:21:49,686
- Get out there.

1517
01:21:49,686 --> 01:21:51,087
- Hey, hey, hey, keep off her.

1518
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:52,220
- You're fired, and you've
got a lawsuit on your hands

1519
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,858
if you don't get out there right now.

1520
01:21:54,858 --> 01:21:56,070
- I can't.

1521
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:57,970
I've got something I have to tell you.

1522
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:00,205
- What?

1523
01:22:00,205 --> 01:22:01,363
- I got a call from the vet.

1524
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,570
I'm on tonight, you creep,
but you better get yourself

1525
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:13,920
another singer by tomorrow.

1526
01:22:24,827 --> 01:22:26,517
- I was afraid you'd be too late.

1527
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:27,543
He's had another stroke.

1528
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,520
- Hi, hi kiddo, how are you doin'?

1529
01:22:35,726 --> 01:22:36,830
- [Veterinarian] I'm not
sure how much he can hear.

1530
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,580
And he's almost completely
paralyzed on both sides now.

1531
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,730
- Listen, could you
leave me alone with him

1532
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,513
for just a little while?

1533
01:22:48,395 --> 01:22:49,395
- Of course.

1534
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:54,210
- Well, this is, uh, this is great.

1535
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:58,173
You're lying around here
taking it easy while I'm,

1536
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,758
I'm busting my hump trying
to keep us in black coffee

1537
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:05,303
and bananas.

1538
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:08,179
You want the details, right?

1539
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,773
The new kid, he hit all his cues.

1540
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:16,360
And I was like, like really hot, you know?

1541
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,810
This is all stuff, you
know, that I'll read

1542
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:23,083
you tomorrow when Variety
hits the stands, but,

1543
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:28,663
in the meantime, let me just say that, uh,

1544
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:34,940
it was one of the biggest
thrills of my life.

1545
01:23:39,207 --> 01:23:40,860
A Vegas showroom, Arch.

1546
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,693
Not a lounge.

1547
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:43,976
Not a little club.

1548
01:23:43,976 --> 01:23:46,527
Not one of those toilets like, uh,

1549
01:23:49,789 --> 01:23:50,622
where the hell was it?

1550
01:23:52,245 --> 01:23:53,078
Boise, Boise.

1551
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:55,983
Oh, remember that dump?

1552
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:00,623
This was a real, uh,

1553
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,133
real Vegas show.

1554
01:24:09,197 --> 01:24:10,837
It was a, it was a dream come true.

1555
01:24:15,756 --> 01:24:16,906
Yeah, tonight is, uh...

1556
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:24,162
it's the happiest night of my life.

1557
01:24:26,085 --> 01:24:29,502
(slow, melancholy music)

1558
01:24:57,811 --> 01:25:00,978
(soft mariachi music)

1559
01:25:11,822 --> 01:25:14,251
Everybody came out for the funeral.

1560
01:25:14,251 --> 01:25:16,823
It was really a dignified service.

1561
01:25:18,267 --> 01:25:22,370
Well as dignified as it can
be when you're bury next to

1562
01:25:23,684 --> 01:25:24,534
Beanie and Bitsy.

1563
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,463
It was the last time I saw my buddy, but,

1564
01:25:32,204 --> 01:25:33,273
not the last time I thought about him.

1565
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:37,973
And not the last time that I missed him.

1566
01:25:46,553 --> 01:25:47,760
Thank you guys.

1567
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,960
Archie would have loved.

1568
01:25:51,047 --> 01:25:53,097
I'd like to say a few words about Archie.

1569
01:25:55,036 --> 01:25:56,980
You all knew him as a sweet, gentle guy

1570
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,893
with a loving heart.

1571
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:06,933
Archie was more human than most
people I've met in my life.

1572
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,083
He was my best friend for 25 years.

1573
01:26:14,678 --> 01:26:16,093
I'm gonna miss him every time I,

1574
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:20,283
I see that toothpaste cap
exactly where I left it.

1575
01:26:22,863 --> 01:26:25,260
I'm gonna miss him when I go
through a whole day without

1576
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,673
someone playing a practical joke on me.

1577
01:26:33,491 --> 01:26:34,824
Good bye, kiddo.

1578
01:26:36,092 --> 01:26:39,509
(slow, melancholy music)

1579
01:27:22,356 --> 01:27:23,939
- Good bye, Archie.

1580
01:27:24,987 --> 01:27:28,404
(slow, melancholy music)

1581
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:43,250
So where do you think you and Terrance

1582
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,000
will be playing next?

1583
01:27:45,998 --> 01:27:47,603
- He won't be playing anywhere next.

1584
01:27:49,361 --> 01:27:50,530
- Well, isn't he going with you?

1585
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:53,563
- Yeah, as a friend and a
pet, but, not as a partner.

1586
01:27:56,822 --> 01:27:59,280
I've gotta try it on my own as a comic.

1587
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:04,420
- I think it's about time.

1588
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,253
- Laura.

1589
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:11,573
I know I have no right to ask,

1590
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:16,520
and I know I'm not a very
good prospect, I mean,

1591
01:28:17,905 --> 01:28:20,600
as of last night, I don't have a job.

1592
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,650
- I'm going with you.

1593
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:26,213
- I guess that was
pretty persuasive stuff.

1594
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:29,710
(chuckles)

1595
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:30,697
I love you.

1596
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,210
- But do you need me?

1597
01:28:39,371 --> 01:28:41,100
- I guess this is the
part where I could really

1598
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,000
