1
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>Teeth outlast everything.</i>

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,902
<i>Death is nothing to a tooth.</i>

3
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,609
<i>Hundreds of years in acidic soil</i>
<i>just keep teeth clean.</i>

4
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,243
<i>A fire that burns away</i>
<i>everything else, hair and skin...</i>

5
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,949
<i>... even bones,</i>
<i>leaves your teeth dazzling.</i>

6
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,753
Open.

7
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,898
<i>Life is what destroys teeth.</i>

8
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,367
<i>Undiluted apple juice</i>
<i>in baby bottles, sour balls.</i>

9
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,062
<i>The pH balance of drinking water,</i>
<i>tetracycline...</i>

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,504
<i>... sand in your bread...</i>

11
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,474
<i>... if you were in the Roman army.</i>

12
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,511
<i>Teeth are important.</i>

13
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,515
<i>Eskimo cultures abandoned</i>
<i>their old folks in the snow...</i>

14
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,019
<i>... when their teeth went, no matter</i>
<i>how good their health was otherwise.</i>

15
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,253
<i>In my experience...</i>

16
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,884
<i>... dentists are convinced patients</i>
<i>can't be trusted with their teeth.</i>

17
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,793
Turn to me, please.

18
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,739
<i>You can't grieve</i>
<i>for every tooth, though...</i>

19
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,307
<i>... every mouth.</i>

20
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,070
<i>You can't even grieve</i>
<i>for the worst of them.</i>

21
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:31,240
<i>You can only send the patient home</i>
<i>with as many teeth as possible.</i>

22
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,885
Beside your present cavities, you've
got some poorly filled teeth here.

23
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,924
And one of your wisdom teeth
seems to have migrated.

24
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,325
You know, no dentist
I have ever known...

25
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:48,160
...has ever had anything good to say
about another dentist's work.

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,064
You notice that?

27
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,367
Well, I'm married to one
and we're big admirers of each other.

28
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,601
- One of your wisdom teeth...
- You better be cheap.

29
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,111
- Why is that?
- Because five years from now...

30
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,843
...some other guy's gonna tell me
he's got to redo all of your work.

31
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,543
Just watch.

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,280
- Open.
- They get more fucked up every day.

33
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,857
I'm a trumpet player,
so don't mess with my front teeth.

34
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,187
That could screw up my embouchure.

35
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,387
Okay. Open.

36
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,693
I'm not so sure that I wanna open.

37
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,700
Maybe I wanna save my money
for something more valuable.

38
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,866
We ask patients to pay
for appointments they don't keep.

39
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:35,947
- Lf you're uneasy about discomfort...
- No, no, no. I don't care if it pinches.

40
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,949
I don't care if it hurts like hell. My
wife made this appointment for me.

41
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,883
I lost my job and she kicked me
out of the house.

42
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,115
- Hi.
- She gave me some little card...

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,555
...that told me to be here.
- How you doing?

44
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,821
I can't believe she still cares
if I go to the dentist.

45
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,932
We certainly don't care,
do we, doctor?

46
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,134
- Open up.
- Are you married to him?

47
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,131
- No. No, I'm single.
- Oh, really?

48
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,773
Yes.

49
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:06,105
I'm waiting for a man who takes
really good care of his teeth...

50
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,247
...which I can tell you don't.

51
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,479
Open, please.

52
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,376
- Lower right, Laura.
- Lower right.

53
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,983
Close, please.

54
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,527
Okay.

55
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,035
Open, please.

56
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,039
Turn to me.

57
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,336
Open.

58
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,843
Little wider, please. Little wider.

59
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,709
Okay.

60
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,215
This won't pinch, I assure you.

61
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,083
Now, nothing hot to drink, Mr. Slater,
at least for an hour or two.

62
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,519
No biting down, no chewing. Okay?

63
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,549
- Good.
- You're a free man.

64
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,718
That wasn't so bad, was it?

65
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,698
Nice. Very special.

66
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,203
- Have you ever been to an opera?
- No.

67
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,666
It is so beautiful, you know?

68
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,408
- I never paid attention to it, but...
- Need me to pick anything up?

69
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,174
I've got it taken care of.

70
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,548
- I'm on my new favorite theme.
- Yes. Rehearsal tonight?

71
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,621
- I'll cook, though.
- You sure?

72
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,417
- Okay, sorry to interrupt. Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Dave.

73
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,082
- Bye.
- Bye, Dave.

74
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,921
It's just like...

75
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,759
...all the things
you can't really say in life...

76
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:11,734
...but lifted. And so,
kind of, purified by the music.

77
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,464
Rinse, please.

78
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,573
- That's it, Larry.
- There's a lot of blood.

79
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,845
- Both of you... Both of you stop.
- You're kicking me.

80
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:27,418
- Yeah, I know.
- Stop kicking.

81
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,351
- Stop it.
- You don't want this, right?

82
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,515
- Dad?
- Stephanie?

83
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,763
- She watches you, so don't do it.
- I wasn't.

84
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,900
- There, you see?
- I wasn't kicking, I'm stretching.

85
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,127
Well, don't stretch.

86
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,794
Mom, jeez.

87
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,409
- It's so sad.
- I'll say.

88
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,071
- Don't encourage her, please.
- I'm sorry.

89
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,614
- You girls are gonna be hooked.
- Sprouts.

90
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,480
The music is so inspiring.

91
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,350
The Hebrew virgins
are begging God, see?

92
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,355
And they're saying...

93
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,319
- Take sprouts.
- I don't want any.

94
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,659
Try one, you might be surprised.
You might like it.

95
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,101
It sounds very beautiful in Italian.

96
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,106
Oh, and this is my favorite part.

97
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,643
I don't understand why people
don't like Brussels sprouts.

98
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,707
Stop it. She's still kicking me, Dad.

99
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,650
Leah, stop.

100
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,981
Stephanie, you taught her that.

101
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,818
You have a responsibility
to be a role model for her.

102
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,324
<i>The fire quickly spread</i>
<i>to three alarms...</i>

103
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,192
<i>... in a building 39 stories high</i>
<i>with more than 450 apartments.</i>

104
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,999
<i>It took more than 160 firefighters</i>
<i>an hour and a half...</i>

105
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,966
<i>... to get the blaze under control.</i>

106
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,471
<i>Most residents who were injured</i>
<i>suffered from smoke inhalation.</i>

107
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,973
<i>All 12 firefighters</i>...

108
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,578
Come.

109
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,751
Long rehearsal, huh?

110
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,392
- Good night.
- Good night.

111
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,093
Love you.

112
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,740
Remember when a year
seemed like a long time?

113
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,772
Yes, I sure do.

114
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,753
Daddy!

115
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,623
Daddy! Daddy!

116
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,628
- Hello, you.
- No, I want Daddy!

117
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,291
Okay.

118
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,763
She wants you.

119
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,033
Sorry.

120
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,568
Really?

121
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,966
She's a good eater, isn't she?

122
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:06,475
You know when you let bathwater out
and there's a lot of gray stuff in it?

123
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,581
- Yeah.
- That's your skin.

124
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,149
- It's true. That is your skin.
- It is? Skin?

125
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,946
Is that what you're studying?

126
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,520
Really?

127
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,781
- I gotta get dressed.
- Come here, sweetie.

128
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,927
Mommy will feed you. There you go.

129
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,391
- No!
- Hey!

130
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,428
Don't hit.

131
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,730
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,767
Hey, you have to learn
to be more careful. Look at me.

133
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,804
- Look at me, you.
- She just loves you, that's all.

134
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,140
- It won't last.
- No hitting.

135
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,334
Daddy!

136
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,277
- Daddy!
- She'll stop soon, I promise, Carol.

137
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,747
- Don't you worry.
- I promise you, she'll be fine.

138
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,752
- Daddy!
- I'm gonna call you at intermission.

139
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,117
- You don't have to.
- Daddy!

140
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,419
- Have a great performance.
- Okay.

141
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,961
- Did not!
- Did too!

142
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,757
You lied to that poor girl.

143
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,025
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.

144
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,725
- No, I didn't.
- All right. In.

145
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,703
- Yes, you did.
- I didn't.

146
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:14,536
Now, Nabucco is the one with the
crown and the big stick, okay?

147
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,978
He's the king,
but he's also the reason...

148
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,379
...why everyone is so unhappy.

149
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,381
And you'll see me
with all of the other slaves...

150
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,820
...down by the River Babylon,
which is down left...

151
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,051
...which really means to your right.

152
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,219
And we're all singing to God
for mercy...

153
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,525
...and redemption,
about how we're in chains.

154
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,225
And we're all weeping
in this big temple.

155
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,803
- Here.
- What is this, your rabbit's foot?

156
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,702
- It's good luck.
- That's great.

157
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,503
Oh, honey, that is so beautiful.

158
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,339
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

159
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,775
What, honey?

160
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,246
What?

161
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,751
- Hi.
- You look great, Dana.

162
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,322
- Hang on.
- She forgot her rabbit's foot.

163
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,262
- Her what?
- Her rabbit's foot. I gave it to her.

164
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,164
Well, honey, all right.
I'll take it to her.

165
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,703
Stay here.

166
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,508
She needs good luck.

167
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,908
Excuse me.

168
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,050
Hi!

169
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,261
Sorry. Did you give it to her?

170
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,331
- Dad, did you give it to her?
- Yes.

171
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,627
Okay, here we go.

172
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,649
How do you play in a
penguin suit like that?

173
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,851
Look at all these guys.
They're all dressed up.

174
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,199
Hey, that's my dentist.

175
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,298
- Guy over there?
- I'll catch you later.

176
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,164
Later.

177
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,633
- Hey, look, there's Mom's name.
- Really?

178
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,072
- Yeah. See?
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,376
"Dana Hurst, as one of the virgins."

180
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,884
Hey! Hey, doc.

181
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,019
Hey.

182
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,711
Hey, doc.

183
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,617
Dad.

184
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,385
- Hey, how are you?
- Hello.

185
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,429
- Hi, Mr...?
- The filling you gave me fell out.

186
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,756
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

187
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,562
I was practicing, it fell out
and I almost choked.

188
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,436
So...

189
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,475
I don't...

190
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,339
It's my dentist.

191
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,415
Okay, well, come back in,
we can replace it, okay?

192
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,519
Why don't you just replace
my fucking money?

193
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,086
Okay, call my...
However you wanna handle it.

194
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,453
- Call my secretary.
- I don't feel like it.

195
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,095
Here it is. How about that?
Fell right out.

196
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,596
World's greatest dentist,
if you wanna get your teeth worked on.

197
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,563
- Thank you.
- It's a nice filling.

198
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,499
Call my secretary and we can...
Thanks.

199
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,538
- What?
- Thank you.

200
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,743
Unbelievable.

201
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,660
- She's so beautiful.
- I know, she is.

202
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,132
- This was so cool.
- Yeah.

203
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,401
- She's so beautiful.
- You can yell "bravo" if you want.

204
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,203
Bravo!

205
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,036
- There she is.
- Mom!

206
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,445
- Hi.
- It was great.

207
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,605
- Yeah, you were really good.
- Did you like it?

208
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,274
- Yes.
- Here. Pretend you had this all along.

209
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,580
Hey, it was my lucky rabbit's foot.
That's what it was.

210
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,863
Just a second. I know. I know.

211
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,862
- Say good night to Mommy.
- I don't want to!

212
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,600
- Mommy, we came to say good night.
- No! No!

213
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,336
- You can sleep in the nursery.
- I don't want to.

214
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,503
We wanna sleep with you, don't we?

215
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,706
Hey! Hey. Now, stop it. I mean it.

216
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,546
- It's just a phase.
- I don't care. There's no hitting.

217
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,480
Come on, let's just go.

218
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,525
- Hey, let's lie down with Mommy.
- Come to Mommy, honey. Come here.

219
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,185
- Let Mommy hold you.
- I want my crib in my room!

220
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,264
- Quiet!
- I can't sleep!

221
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,627
Can't sleep!

222
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,461
Hi.

223
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,688
Hi.

224
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,231
What time is it?
You look scary.

225
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,361
I just can't believe
it's over, you know?

226
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,734
It's so beautiful.

227
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,934
I could sing it every night forever.

228
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,308
Well, you'll sing other things.

229
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,509
I don't wanna sing other things.

230
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,618
Okay.

231
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,986
Well...

232
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,233
I saw that Slater guy last night.
His filling fell out.

233
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,337
What?

234
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,439
He's the one I told you about.

235
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,667
Impacted upper and lower.

236
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,745
One of them halfway up to his eyeball.

237
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,111
Won't have them out till they hurt.

238
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,448
Needs to see a periodontist. Anyway,
if you get him, don't charge him.

239
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,559
Okay?

240
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,794
It's a waltz.

241
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,262
That's what's so tragic.

242
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,968
I mean, you could dance to it, but...

243
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,939
But you can't.

244
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,945
Look up, kiddo.

245
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,686
- Let's go take a shower.
- Daddy!

246
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,793
- Daddy!
- She needs a bath.

247
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,930
I'll take care of it. You wake up.

248
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,931
- Daddy!
- Yes?

249
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,797
- Dave!
- Dave is coming.

250
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,772
Megan has her own bathroom,
and her big sister...

251
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,603
You're making wind? I hope not.

252
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,374
I'm going to the store for juice
and a paper. Anybody wanna come?

253
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,278
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

254
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,442
Back in a flash.

255
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,247
- Bye.
- Bye.

256
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,447
You look pretty, Mom.

257
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,148
Want anything special?

258
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,228
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning, guys.

259
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,703
- Pancakes then cereal.
- You want oatmeal with that?

260
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,137
- No.
- What do you think?

261
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,176
- Milk in the cereal.
- Zip!

262
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,279
That's what Mommy says.

263
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,813
That's got to stop, young lady.

264
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,589
- Hello, remember us?
- Hi.

265
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,592
- Look what's on. Let's check it out.
- No! No!

266
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:27,789
Don't you wanna watch TV
with Lizzie and Steph? Sure you do.

267
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,458
- Come on, you guys.
- Yeah, we're trying to watch TV here.

268
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,501
All right, come help your sisters.

269
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,833
- Thanks for the help.
- Remember the hands?

270
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,574
<i>We're washing dishes</i>

271
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,768
And then we make a cake.

272
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,212
A wedding cake.

273
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,410
Vanilla and chocolate and pink...

274
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,714
Pink flowers.

275
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,089
- I've got doughnuts for the girls!
- Hey!

276
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:01,562
It's such a beautiful day. Hi!
There's my lovely little girl.

277
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,701
- Hi...
- No!

278
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,498
Fine. Lizzie, you wanna drive up
to the country? Does that sound fun?

279
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,004
- Sure.
- Should we drive up to the house?

280
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,507
Maybe we'll take a picnic, huh?

281
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,805
- Dave?
- Yeah. Wanna go to the country?

282
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,575
- No!
- How about you?

283
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,212
Well, it was something.

284
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,254
What's with this traffic?

285
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,560
- Why is it black?
- Because nature... Hey.

286
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,597
Not so near the edge, sweetie.

287
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,634
Nature is trying to get rid
of all the old things.

288
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,101
- It breaks into particles...
- It stinks!

289
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,037
...and it turns black.
It's a good thing, believe me.

290
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,473
Look at that.

291
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,239
All right, you know what?
We'll come back to this.

292
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,247
Come on, come on, come on.

293
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,916
- Take this.
- Come on. Race you.

294
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,684
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Don't look at it. That's nature again.

295
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,423
I don't wanna.

296
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,929
It's our fault for leaving that stuff
in the fridge so long.

297
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:16,005
That's nature just trying
to break it all down.

298
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,315
I wish we were closer...

299
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,785
...sometimes.

300
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,688
Do you think Leah's reacting
to something between us?

301
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,937
Are you asleep, Dave?

302
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,705
Dave?

303
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,578
David?

304
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,130
Smile for me.

305
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,036
Good. You can rinse.

306
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,013
Okay.

307
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,944
- I'll get this for you.
- Excuse me one minute.

308
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,884
- Hey.
- Lizzie's home with an upset stomach.

309
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,614
Carol came and took her home.

310
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,850
- Hope it's not the flu.
- It's the usual.

311
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,621
- Elaine's kids had it.
- I called home, she's fine.

312
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:48,061
But I didn't have time
to get anything for dinner.

313
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,531
Okay, so we'll see you,
what, around 6:00?

314
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,262
Yeah, 6:30. Sometime.

315
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,599
Okay.

316
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,967
Come on!

317
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:14,478
- Now it's tofu!
- Tofu. It's a soybean type of thing.

318
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,449
You don't have to eat any more.

319
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,788
You try that, honey.
Is your stomach still upset?

320
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,123
Hi, everybody. I'm sorry I'm late.

321
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,694
Hi, honey.

322
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,365
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

323
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,894
- Hi, honey. How's your tummy?
- Better.

324
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,128
It is? Good.

325
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,398
- What's for dinner?
- Oh, something I whipped up.

326
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,303
- It's good.
- Yeah.

327
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:42,003
Oh, good. Well, let me just
wash up and I'll be right back.

328
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,772
Okay?

329
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,218
Mommy's home!

330
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,295
Okay, there's...

331
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,068
...no inflammation...

332
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,636
...no fever, it's not the flu.

333
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,773
She doesn't want to go to school.

334
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,536
It's been every morning this week,
so...

335
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,617
You know what, Lizzie?

336
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,617
Sometimes...

337
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,984
...when mommies
and daddies argue...

338
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,259
...it makes a child feel bad.
- What? We're not arguing.

339
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,258
Dana and I?

340
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,657
Honey, we should go.

341
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,162
- Can I weigh myself?
- Can you weigh yourself?

342
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,268
- I don't know, can she weigh herself?
- Absolutely.

343
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,801
The stomach problem
she's always had...

344
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,567
...is going to be the focus
of all her uneasiness.

345
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:23,307
Every feeling is in the body
as well as in the mind.

346
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,810
We're not arguing, Danny.

347
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,954
<i>Not much to tell.</i>

348
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,817
<i>We met, fell in love.</i>

349
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,625
<i>Just like that.</i>

350
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,934
That was a hard week, huh?

351
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,931
Little Leah doesn't make it any easier.

352
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,771
What if she's like this forever?

353
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,745
Remember when Lizzie was waking
up four or five times a night?

354
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,113
- Stephanie swallowed that penny?
- Oh, my God.

355
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,964
- You know, you scare me a little.
- What?

356
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,230
You do, you always have.
Isn't that funny?

357
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,306
You don't smile much.

358
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,034
Not like most people do, anyway.

359
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,011
You're awfully tall.

360
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,152
Yes, you are, you're very tall.

361
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,681
We've been married 10 years,
I was always tall.

362
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,929
Remember when you'd
ride me on the handlebars?

363
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,032
- How can you say you don't scare me?
- I was trying to.

364
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,397
- Why?
- Because you scared me.

365
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,131
You were so fucking smart
you scared everybody.

366
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,973
And you know it.

367
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,812
- What are we watching?
- Movie night.

368
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,682
<i>By way of thanks, I betrayed him.</i>

369
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,824
<i>I broke his heart</i>
<i>in one way or another.</i>

370
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,823
Do you like me?

371
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,397
I love you.

372
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,961
I mean, if you weren't
sleeping with me.

373
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:29,266
Would you want to talk to me
and have lunch with me, and...?

374
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,405
- You would?
- Yes, I would.

375
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,546
Do you think that we're friends?

376
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,515
I'll prove it to you.

377
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:59,191
I thought it would be different,
you know, our marriage.

378
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,405
I thought it would
be like the Cinerama...

379
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,010
...and it would just get
wider and wider and...

380
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,777
It doesn't.
It just gets smaller and smaller.

381
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,938
No, it doesn't.

382
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,855
If you rest your head back,
and give yourself over to the screen.

383
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,785
Let that Elmer Bernstein
music swell up.

384
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:33,327
- See all the great cinematography.
- Dave.

385
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,075
You're supposed to eat it
with a spoon and milk.

386
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,743
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Dad.

387
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,356
- Where's Mom?
- She had to go in early.

388
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,890
She wants you to take
Leah to daycare.

389
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,528
- Oh, yeah?
- She left you a note.

390
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,756
- Here's the airplane.
- A note, a note, a note!

391
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,197
- Okay, Leah, Leah...
- A note, a note!

392
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,180
He touches me and I quit.

393
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,285
- Hurst Dental.
- So she's up next.

394
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,790
- Yeah, why don't you go get prepped.
- My pleasure.

395
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,331
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,495
Dr. Dave?

397
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,933
- He's back.
- Who?

398
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,331
Promise me you're in a better mood
than you were last time, Mr. Slater.

399
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,603
- Why?
- Oh, good, glad to hear that.

400
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,215
So how are you
and your wife doing?

401
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,511
She kicked me out. I told you
that the last time I was here.

402
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,847
Right, she kicked you out.
Open, please.

403
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,513
- I want to...
- Pineapple.

404
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,922
- The doctor will be here in a minute.
- I wanted to mention...

405
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,153
If you keep talking,
you won't get numb.

406
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,390
- I want you aware of my embouchure.
- Your what?

407
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:47,061
- I'm sorry.
- His embouchure. That's all right.

408
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,139
Mr. Slater.

409
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,211
Dr. Mengele.

410
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:08,919
- Certainly doesn't taste like pineapple.
- Let's just take a look at that, all right?

411
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,219
Yeah, okay.

412
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,331
I can see what happened.
Did you chew on this?

413
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:26,268
<i>The social nature of the dental</i>
<i>situation is the hardest thing for me.</i>

414
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:34,350
<i>There's a certain pleasure</i>
<i>for a meditative person like myself...</i>

415
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:39,387
<i>... in laying down one thread</i>
<i>and picking up another...</i>

416
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,185
<i>... as if everything isn't</i>
<i>happening at once.</i>

417
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,563
<i>I am 38 years old,</i>
<i>and it seems to me...</i>

418
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,793
<i>... that I've arrived at the age of grief.</i>

419
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,266
<i>My wife is seeing another man</i>
<i>and I don't kick her out of the house.</i>

420
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,378
She doesn't kick me out. I can't
imagine kicking anyone out.

421
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,104
Do you kick them?

422
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,857
<i>Or do you kick them?</i>

423
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,098
You can rinse.

424
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,430
- Good as new, no charge.
- That's a really good deal.

425
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,100
You should have those
wisdom teeth looked at.

426
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:38,305
- Not unless they start to hurt.
- Well, it's not a good idea to wait.

427
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,493
Dr. Dave...

428
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,363
...want me to reschedule tomorrow's
appointments if Mark doesn't...?

429
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,090
So that other one, was that your wife?

430
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,251
I didn't get a good look at her.

431
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,591
Well, forget about it.

432
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,963
Dave, let me explain something
to you, okay? People...

433
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,835
...hate you, you're a dentist.

434
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,439
- Is that right?
- They can't wait to get out...

435
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,044
...of your office, okay? They think
about you, they think "pain."

436
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,444
They would like nothing more
than to never have to see you again.

437
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:50,019
And your best work never
even sees the light of day.

438
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,322
Well, you're going to lose every
tooth in your mouth, my friend.

439
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,826
You've got one of the worst cases
of gum disease I've ever seen.

440
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:05,400
So you can forget about
your lousy, little embouchure.

441
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,370
- Hi, Leah. Hi.
- Go around.

442
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,772
Have fun?

443
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,445
Could you belt her in, please?
Watch your leg.

444
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:29,554
So you're kind of like
the mommy here.

445
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,458
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean, you welcome the girls...

446
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,623
...you pick them up and drive
them around. It's sweet.

447
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,200
- Everybody in?
- Yeah.

448
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,064
Buckle, you.

449
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,365
Do you do the washing
and the sewing...

450
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,203
...and teach them about
makeup and stuff?

451
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,402
- How to use a barrette?
- Dad?

452
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,171
- What?
- Can we go look at toys?

453
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,815
No, you have too many toys.

454
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,133
- Hi.
- Hi.

455
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,299
Hi, Mom.

456
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,003
Hey.

457
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,672
- Hey.
- How was work?

458
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,546
Okay.

459
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,550
It's good to see you.

460
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,454
- Hi.
- Hi.

461
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,234
Wait a minute.

462
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,329
Attaboy.

463
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,968
- It's great to see you.
- Take her upstairs.

464
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,703
I'm glad.

465
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,449
So, what's new?

466
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,112
Nothing, since I saw you
this afternoon, nothing.

467
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,985
What, nothing can happen
in five hours?

468
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,828
Well, in this case it didn't.

469
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,931
- Bullshit.
- Who did you see?

470
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,824
Who were your patients,
who did you see today?

471
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,734
I don't know, honey, you saw the
appointment book. Mrs. Margolis.

472
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,341
Yeah, I like her.

473
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,039
Yeah, the usual.

474
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,948
The usual?

475
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,874
Isn't that nice.

476
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,451
- You have your own.
- You have a plate of your own food.

477
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:45,220
- Hers is better.
- No, they're both the same.

478
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,697
- Too big.
- Still?

479
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,800
Mandy's going to a different camp.

480
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,266
- She is? Which one?
- I forget.

481
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,997
- We'll have to find out.
- You can eat that.

482
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,142
- I don't like it.
- Eat it anyways.

483
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,804
- I don't want it.
- Eat it anyway.

484
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,607
- I don't want it!
- Hey!

485
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,187
Look at me.

486
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,156
Look at me.

487
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,731
Where's the booze?

488
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:30,135
Guess what? I'm putting you
to bed, you understand me?

489
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,572
- No, I don't want to!
- Cry if you want.

490
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:37,242
- Cry all you want!
- No, I don't want to!

491
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,678
Cry till you're an old woman.
It's not soon enough...

492
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,946
...as far as I'm concerned!
- Daddy's sort of mad.

493
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,921
Daddy! Daddy!

494
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,188
No!

495
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,463
Daddy!

496
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,136
Daddy!

497
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,930
Daddy!

498
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,932
Daddy!

499
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,942
- Daddy!
- Be quiet!

500
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,944
Attaboy.

501
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,244
Dave?

502
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,113
- Dave?
- That would be you, buddy.

503
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,277
- What?
- You don't need to shout at her.

504
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,549
Somebody has to.
I do all the work around here, anyway.

505
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:26,094
- Everything's more fucked every day.
- Everything's more fucked every day.

506
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,396
- Tell us what you're so angry about.
- I'm not angry.

507
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,935
Kill her. I would.

508
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,997
Everything's more fucked up
every day.

509
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,469
You've always said that, and I hate it.

510
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,238
I have not always said it,
I just thought of it.

511
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,181
- Girls, you're excused.
- Stay.

512
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,322
- Admit that every day is worse.
- No!

513
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,487
- It is.
- I don't believe that.

514
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,920
Admit it!

515
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,463
I could kill you.

516
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,439
What did you just say to me?

517
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,604
What?

518
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:21,949
I didn't say anything.

519
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,288
- You said you could kill me?
- I didn't mean to say that.

520
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,317
But you thought it,
you thought you could kill me?

521
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:35,659
One crack, right between the eyes.

522
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,133
You can't control your thoughts.

523
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,867
A person can think anything
they want.

524
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:52,275
But you mustn't act on every thought
that you have.

525
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,579
Right?

526
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,316
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Excuse me.

527
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,505
My father always said:

528
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,843
"If you're mad, whatever you do,
don't get in the car."

529
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,754
Fuck him, he was a jerk.

530
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,648
Yes, he was.

531
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,495
Go upstairs, girls.

532
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,046
Fucking bitch!

533
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,055
Fucking bitch!

534
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,387
You fucking bitch!

535
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,829
We're upset about something,
aren't we, Dave?

536
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,631
I wish my wife loved me.

537
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,664
How do you know she doesn't?

538
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:02,041
I wish she would look at me
with desire instead of regret.

539
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,276
Yeah.

540
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,317
Who is he?

541
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,124
When does she see him?

542
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,088
- How do you know he even exists?
- It's just a feeling.

543
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,761
- A feeling.
- I saw the back of his head.

544
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,896
He's probably the music director.

545
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,108
She sees him when she can...

546
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,302
...a few minutes here or there,
it's nothing too tangible.

547
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,205
Why don't you just come
right out and ask her?

548
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,412
Because...

549
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,486
Because, if she tells me she loves
him, we have to do something about it.

550
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,424
Yeah, that's right.

551
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:58,466
But if I let her go through it and work
out whatever it is she needs to do...

552
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,367
...maybe I can save my marriage.
- Wait, wait...

553
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,999
I don't consider you a reliable source
on the subject of marriage, okay?

554
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,735
Fair enough.

555
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,607
But why isn't she leaving you, then?
I mean...

556
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,682
...if she is seeing somebody,
and I'd rather know...

557
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,220
...one way or the other,
but you know what?

558
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,493
Maybe he rejected her.
Did you ever think about that?

559
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,998
I mean, he's just messing around,
having fun...

560
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:32,693
...that's why she stays. Because
otherwise, she'd get out of there.

561
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,533
I mean, not that she's a willful bitch,
or such a willful bitch, but...

562
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,175
Dave?

563
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,403
Are we leaving?

564
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,379
See you back at the house.

565
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,971
I love you.

566
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,570
Yeah, I know.

567
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,478
I do, I love you so much.

568
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,883
<i>Oh, yes, there is, Ms. Lawrence.</i>

569
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,888
<i>I'm familiar with the serum</i>
<i>Dr. Markoff has for the cure.</i>

570
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:36,923
<i>His recovery depends solely on you.</i>

571
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,823
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>I will cure your father...</i>

572
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,895
<i>... when you decide</i>
<i>to become my wife.</i>

573
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,464
<i>Let go of me. I'll never marry you.</i>

574
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:49,799
<i>Never is a long time.</i>
<i>Some people do change their mind.</i>

575
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:15,657
I love the first, cold sting of juice,
you know?

576
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,163
- Yeah.
- You get that?

577
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,861
- Yeah.
- Like it hurts and it doesn't, sort of?

578
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,664
I love that.

579
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,106
Hey, I have a great idea.

580
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,574
Why don't you take the girls
to the house...

581
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,873
...and we'll spend the night.
Would you girls like that?

582
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,414
Yeah, let's go!

583
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,985
- What about my morning patients?
- I'll take them, and then I'll...

584
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,420
...take the train and meet
you for dinner.

585
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,619
- Right.
- I don't mind.

586
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,488
Of course you don't.

587
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,926
Well, okay.

588
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:51,226
But I could take yours,
I mean, that would be just as easy.

589
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,535
Oh, I just...

590
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,769
I thought you could use a day away.

591
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:03,970
But if you don't want to, that's fine,
we don't have to go, we can stay here.

592
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:08,510
- I wanna go!
- Hold it. I'd love to.

593
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,619
- Yes.
- Yeah.

594
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,324
I'm lazy and sleepy!

595
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,162
You got one, Steph?
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

596
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:27,894
- Animal.
- You just did animal.

597
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,868
- Animal crackers!
- Animal crackers?

598
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:33,200
- Dad, my stomach feels funny.
- Stay away from me.

599
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,369
- Shouldn't have had so much milk.
- I didn't, I took three sips. Stop, Dad.

600
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,481
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Oh, gosh!

601
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,617
- You gotta pull over.
- I'll pull over.

602
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,185
- Wait for this car.
- Let me wait for this car.

603
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,118
- Hurry up.
- Okay, hang on, sweetie.

604
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,588
- Here we go.
- Take her belt off.

605
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,057
Take your belt off, okay?

606
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,792
Come on, come on, come on.

607
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,531
Anything?

608
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,200
We can stop again if you have to,
all right?

609
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,634
Back on the road now.

610
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,038
Seat belt, please.

611
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,249
Wow, I feel better.

612
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:32,691
What do you suppose he's
doing to her right this second?

613
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,629
Have you thought about that?

614
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,209
I would.

615
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,079
Maybe she's dead.

616
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,579
That...

617
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,884
...would be sad.

618
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:56,516
All right, all right!
Stop your whining!

619
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,589
- Just be quiet.
- Dave!

620
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,924
- What? Fuck!
- Someone's here to see you.

621
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,429
- Terrible.
- Dr. Hurst?

622
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,535
- Yes?
- This was left from the accident.

623
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,399
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm awfully sorry.

624
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,740
Yeah, that's her.

625
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:15,139
You see the two crowns I did,
the Maryland bridge, see that?

626
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,381
- This place?
- Yeah, right here.

627
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,449
Thank you.

628
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,954
Hey, Dave?

629
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,325
Hey, Dave?

630
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,690
Dave?

631
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,941
Dave?

632
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,783
Nope, she's definitely alive.

633
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,216
She's determined to tell me.
See that look on her face?

634
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,592
- Not necessary.
- Goddamn it, I know you're out there!

635
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,126
Dave?

636
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,326
- Goddamn it!
- Mom?

637
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,732
What?

638
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,136
- What, Lizzie?
- What's wrong? What's happening?

639
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,902
- Stephanie.
- Nothing's happening.

640
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,475
- Hat trick.
- I'm calling him, I want him to come in.

641
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,516
- Goddamn it!
- Daddy!

642
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,211
Dave, Leah's calling you!

643
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,653
Dave!

644
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:14,459
- Jackass.
- Mom, what's happening?

645
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,532
What, honey?

646
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:22,228
Well, throw up. Let's just get up.
You wanna get up, you can get up.

647
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:26,669
- Want a cigar?
- I'm not yelling. I'm calling Daddy.

648
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,277
- Okay.
- Thank you.

649
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,105
There you go.

650
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,142
Dave.

651
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,237
No, no, sweetie, go play with the girls.

652
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,294
You're making so much noise!

653
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,326
We're trying to have a picnic!

654
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:12,272
That should be just your size now.
You don't want to look just like Megan.

655
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,342
Why not?

656
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,978
I don't know.

657
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,738
- Yes, I do.
- Honey, no.

658
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,817
You're gonna wear the red one.
It's really warm and it's very stylish.

659
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,079
I want a new coat.

660
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,655
If I buy you a new coat right now,
you are growing so fast...

661
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,794
...it's not going to fit you by the fall.

662
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:35,829
Let's wait until September, then if you
want it, I promise, I'll get it.

663
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,433
Okay?

664
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,771
How's everybody?

665
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,173
- Good.
- Good.

666
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,420
Like this? Watch.

667
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,659
Rock, paper, scissors.

668
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,198
Rock, paper, scissors.

669
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,473
Don't stop, it's fine.

670
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:25,842
Dad!

671
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,609
- Yucky, yucky.
- Disgusting.

672
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,846
- Yuck!
- Yuck.

673
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,293
Whatever Lizzie did or didn't have,
I've got the flu now.

674
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,199
Hundred and two.

675
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,809
Think I should sleep downstairs,
on the couch?

676
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,310
- I know you hate to be sick.
- I'll handle it.

677
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,846
Me too.

678
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,978
- You don't need to sleep on the couch.
- I don't wanna give you this.

679
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,421
Whatever it is,
I'm sure I've already got it.

680
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,157
Okay.

681
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,930
I'll stay on my side
and breathe away from you.

682
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:27,571
How long does it take to go through
the family? Didn't you figure it out?

683
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,212
- Five days.
- That's it, yeah.

684
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,844
See, that would never
even occur to me.

685
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,013
Five days.

686
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,583
God.

687
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,300
I don't know, I think I'd die
if you disappeared.

688
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,702
Or if something happened to you...

689
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,543
...or one of the girls. I do.

690
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,547
I know we get to taking each other
for granted, Dana, but...

691
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,317
I'm all right. Sweet dreams.

692
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,620
I love you.

693
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,300
God, I feel awful.

694
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,500
Here we go.

695
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,956
- Shit!
- What? What's the problem?

696
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,396
- My foot.
- What's the problem, honey? Cramp?

697
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,935
Here, here, stretch it out,
stretch it out, stretch it out.

698
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,469
I can't, I can't, I can't.

699
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,699
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

700
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,709
That's it, that's it.
Bend it, bend it.

701
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,677
That's it. That's it.

702
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,578
That's it.

703
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,875
That's it.

704
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,920
That's it.

705
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,352
There we go.

706
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,518
There we go.

707
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,062
That's it.

708
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,104
- Dave.
- Oh, God, Dana.

709
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,005
I'm sorry I'm me.

710
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,906
Oh, no, no.

711
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,384
I'm not sorry you're you.

712
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,486
Crying?

713
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,253
You know what?
I'm sorry you're you.

714
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,199
Honey, honey, here's the Advil
and the thermometer.

715
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:13,638
I'm gonna take your
morning patients, okay?

716
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:17,575
Here's some ginger ale. I'm gonna
take Leah, and Laura will pick her up.

717
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,375
- I can do that.
- No, we'll see how you feel, okay?

718
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,074
I'm gonna call you later,
I'll call you at lunch.

719
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,480
Okay, honey?

720
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,282
- You're wonderful, thank you.
- Everybody!

721
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,282
Get some sleep.

722
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,519
I'll try, but...

723
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,599
Dana?

724
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,336
- Thank you so much.
- You have a good night, now.

725
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,102
Good night.

726
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,396
David Hurst, goddamn you.

727
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,171
What?

728
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:23,073
I missed you so much today.
I love you.

729
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,805
Well, where were you all this time?

730
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:31,585
We had a leak in the office.
I had to wait 11 hours for a plumber.

731
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:35,190
And remember how you didn't want
to be disturbed on the weekends?

732
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,886
The number's not listed, and I couldn't
remember it. I couldn't call you.

733
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,196
What'd you think,
I was having an affair?

734
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,452
Somebody's throwing her the bone,
big boy. Believe it.

735
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,395
Somebody gonna get that?

736
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,129
Hello?

737
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:27,870
No.

738
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,241
These children are monsters.
They should be struck.

739
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,149
- May I hit them?
- No.

740
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,480
- Where's my dad?
- He's coming now.

741
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,016
- Here he is.
- Hey.

742
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,421
Thanks, Laura. This wasn't necessary.
Can you?

743
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,188
Come here, sweetheart.

744
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:50,423
Dana says you're not to cook anything,
she's gonna be home on time.

745
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,532
And she wants to wait to see
about tomorrow's patients.

746
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,769
- Okay.
- Hi. Hi, dad. Hi.

747
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,874
- Hi, sweetheart, how are you?
- Hi. Hi, Dad. Hi.

748
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,270
Thanks. Hey, Laura?

749
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,642
Thanks so much.

750
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:07,813
Yeah.

751
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:11,245
Hi, sweetie. Hi, sweetie.

752
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,513
Are you all right?

753
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,624
Yeah. Take care, all right?

754
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,624
Okey-doke.

755
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,065
Hi! Hi, hi, hi, hi.

756
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,899
How was school?
Okay, listen...

757
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:36,602
...go in and watch a little TV
with Lizzie and Steph.

758
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,875
Daddy's feeling kind of complicated.

759
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,511
Good.

760
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,990
- What's wrong?
- I don't feel so good.

761
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,097
Dad! Lizzie's sick!

762
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:00,095
Just a sec.

763
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,580
Dad!

764
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,122
Dad!

765
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:27,353
- Yes?
- Lizzie threw up.

766
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,327
Dad!

767
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,132
Do you people do anything else?

768
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:37,466
Dave, the midget is...
She stepped in the puke.

769
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,905
- Better bring some paper towels.
- Who's throwing up?

770
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,867
Paper.

771
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,878
Oh, honey. Oh, that's not right.
Okay, here we go.

772
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,642
- Come here. What happened here?
- I stepped in it.

773
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:52,116
You stepped in it, that's delightful.
Lizzie got a little sick?

774
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,722
And you stepped in it.
Go, go, be by Steph.

775
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,859
- Dad!
- Yeah, okay!

776
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,723
I know, I know, I'm just...

777
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:05,458
I'm just... Okay, I'll be there.
I'm coming, honey. I know.

778
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:07,864
You just gonna leave this here, Dave?

779
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,470
Hold on.

780
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,302
Okay, okay, you're okay.

781
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,074
It's just the flu.

782
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,040
- Dad!
- What?

783
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,206
Dad!

784
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,148
Dave?

785
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:28,018
- All right, let's give this a try.
- Okay.

786
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,488
- Honey, try to drink some fluids.
- I can't.

787
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:31,956
- Just try.
- I can't.

788
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:35,153
Okay, okay.
I know, I know.

789
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,568
You feel sick?
Are you going to throw up?

790
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:45,002
- Okay, she's gonna throw up.
- Okay, okay. Here we go, here we go.

791
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:46,869
That's all right, not to worry.

792
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,278
Well, you seem better.

793
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,121
I think... Yeah, I think I am.

794
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,985
Well, that's something, anyway.

795
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,087
Not a basis for confidence, though.

796
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:15,065
Yeah, I wish you weren't always
so pessimistic.

797
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,399
As long as this lasts,
why don't we avoid talking about...

798
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,374
...how we always are, okay?

799
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,272
Okay.

800
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,048
But no sarcasm, either.

801
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,583
Deal.

802
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,115
Oh, my God.

803
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,818
- Five days.
- Yeah.

804
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:47,467
I think you're exaggerating a little.
Just keep forcing fluids.

805
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,694
Well, Leah's got it too, now.

806
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:53,171
You know, Dave, it's possible
she's picking up on your anxiety.

807
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:56,176
We've all got the flu, Danny.

808
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:01,408
I'm calling to see if there's anything we
should be doing for the flu. Influenza.

809
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,484
- My children are all vomiting...
- <i>I understand.</i>

810
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,245
...excessively, into buckets.

811
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,481
I was worried,
I appreciate your advice.

812
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,818
- <i>Well</i>...
- Thanks.

813
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,194
What a quack, huh?

814
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:20,457
Hey.

815
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,194
- How you doing?
- Okay.

816
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,566
You're looking a little better, I think.

817
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,573
I think we're all doing a little better,
aren't we?

818
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:30,473
Oh, sweetie. Okay, all right.

819
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,114
Okay, that's okay.
That's all right, love.

820
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,011
Dad, ginger ale!

821
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,684
I'll be right there, Liz.
It's all right, love. It's all right.

822
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:42,512
- Hey, what time did you get up?
- Up? What's that?

823
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,285
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

824
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,225
- What's the main symptom?
- Oh, no, she's got it too?

825
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:51,958
- She's all right. We're okay.
- Did you call Elaine? Let me take her.

826
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,694
- No, no, no!
- Honey, it's your mother.

827
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,098
Honey, come here.

828
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:59,035
No, she's like part of my body,
I like it.

829
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,439
There's vomit on the phone
you might wanna wipe off.

830
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,379
Bye-bye, Steph.

831
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:10,110
There goes Stephie.

832
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,381
Okay.

833
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,080
This is fun.

834
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:17,649
This is fun.

835
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:22,060
We are bouncing, this is fun.

836
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,858
This is fun.

837
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,562
It's 8 in the morning.

838
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,069
I'm going to the store for juice
and a paper, who wants to come?

839
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,468
- I do.
- I do too.

840
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:33,869
Me too!

841
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,270
You do?

842
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,605
- Me three, me four!
- We'll all go, huh?

843
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,748
Yeah!

844
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,246
Oh, yes!

845
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,683
Where are we going?

846
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,915
I just have to go in this house
for a little while.

847
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,253
Well, how long will you be?

848
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,623
Oh, about 20 minutes.
Bye, everyone!

849
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,288
- Bye!
- Bye.

850
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:01,559
- Has she brought you here before?
- Lots of times.

851
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,369
Is he nice?

852
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,532
- Yeah.
- Very nice.

853
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,870
- He never screams.
- Or shouts.

854
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,535
- Or sulks.
- Or pouts.

855
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,112
No?

856
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,040
We hate you.

857
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,448
Marry me.

858
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,554
- Hey, Dana?
- Yeah.

859
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,060
- Hi.
- I'm in here.

860
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,756
You better?

861
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,204
Oh, God.

862
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,465
We're a picture, okay.

863
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,303
You wanna...? No.
Mommy's gonna have a little privacy.

864
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,207
- What?
- Nope, nothing.

865
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:45,937
We're going now.

866
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,515
Leah is sleeping.

867
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:59,092
Leah is sleeping now, Leah.

868
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,729
Sleeping. Leah is sleeping.

869
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,025
Marry me, Daddy.

870
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:09,259
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Yes, I do.

871
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:13,841
Someday I'm gonna be a woman.
I'll always be faithful.

872
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:18,375
Listen, whatever Mommy's
going through...

873
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,111
...I know it's not about me.

874
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,551
She's gonna have to work this out
for herself.

875
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,619
So says you.

876
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,657
If I let her tell me,
we're gonna have to do something.

877
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,055
We'll have to act.

878
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,889
- But why?
- See?

879
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:38,499
Because, then the whole machinery
will shift into gear.

880
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:42,068
Separation, divorce, custody.

881
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,863
Not necessarily.

882
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,374
Now, you should really listen to her,
because she is on the ball.

883
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,510
Nobody asked you,
you big slimebucket!

884
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,992
Oh, you're awake.

885
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,927
Here we go. Here we go.

886
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,669
- Can we get you something?
- A knife.

887
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:19,932
Just a sec. Oh, God.

888
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,542
I don't think I can take this,
I can't take it.

889
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,406
All right, I know. Oh, baby.

890
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,071
Dad, can I have some ginger ale?

891
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,739
Listen.

892
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,548
Hey.

893
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,551
I know we haven't really talked, but...

894
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:37,089
- David, David, please.
- Okay. I know. Now's not a good time.

895
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,749
All right, hang on.

896
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:42,454
There we go. There we go.

897
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,430
There we go. You okay?

898
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:50,263
- Would you turn the light off, please?
- Did you want this off? Okay.

899
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,932
Dad?

900
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:54,472
Mommy's okay.

901
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:04,508
Let's see what's going on down here,
shall we?

902
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,854
All right.

903
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,286
Look at Lizzie,
she's back to her old self.

904
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,122
- Hi, Liz. Hi, Steph.
- Hi, Dad.

905
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,355
You'll feel better in hours, I know it.

906
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:19,591
While you sit here and watch
some TV with these guys, okay?

907
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:22,236
- Daddy?
- Look.

908
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:25,734
It's Jemima Puddle-Duck, you see?
Hi, Jemima.

909
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:29,365
And what else do we got here?
Parcheesi, and...

910
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,910
- What's this, Lee-Lee?
- Yes!

911
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,640
What is that?
Look, sweetheart, what's that?

912
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,785
That's right, Barbie's Bubbling Spa.

913
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,717
What else do we...?
And there's Barbie.

914
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:44,985
I think Barbie needs to take a bath,
don't you? Her hair is filthy.

915
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,527
It is filthy. Come on, Barbie,
what a pig you are.

916
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,688
Wash your hair, get on the stick.

917
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,357
- Barbie, you're a pig.
- We've got a brush here.

918
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,173
- <i>Dr. Mengele.</i>
- <i>Dave?</i>

919
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,951
- <i>Are you asleep?</i>
- <i>Dr. Mengele.</i>

920
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:16,750
- <i>David, are you asleep?</i>
- <i>Dr. Mengele.</i>

921
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,289
Are you sleeping now?

922
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,561
Are you sleeping on the couch?

923
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,237
You're soaking wet.

924
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,697
Come here.

925
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:36,001
What time is it?

926
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,712
Dave!

927
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,078
Dave!

928
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:58,196
Leah's better, and Lizzie's all well.

929
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,201
Finally.

930
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:01,858
Dad!

931
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,233
- Stephanie's sick.
- Oh, my God.

932
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:08,140
Steph?

933
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,242
Honey?

934
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,682
Hey, hey, you wanna go upstairs?

935
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,876
- I don't feel good.
- Is your tummy upset?

936
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:21,921
Mommy's up there. I got a feeling this
is gonna go fast for you and Mommy.

937
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,082
Here we go. Let's go get
something to drink, all right?

938
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,727
- Where's Leah?
- I don't know.

939
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:28,226
- Can you find her?
- Leah!

940
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:29,761
Thank you.

941
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:34,631
Oh, you're gonna be in big trouble.

942
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:38,170
- Dad, she's right here!
- Okay, I think the yelling can stop.

943
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,309
Leah, sweetie, that's naughty.
Don't do that, honey.

944
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,240
- Watch her, I can't do everything.
- I'm getting milk.

945
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:47,939
I don't care. Can you get that away
from her, please? Thank you.

946
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:54,652
Daddy?

947
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,527
Hey.

948
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,362
That's right. Yeah.

949
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,830
Hey, Dave.

950
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,263
Bet you thought it was gonna start
calming down around here?

951
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:46,874
Nope. Hey, why don't you
come on tour with us, man?

952
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:53,477
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go.
All right, I'm gonna put you down.

953
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,611
Why do you wanna fight for this shit?
Come on, dump the evil bitch.

954
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,315
Put the kids up for adoption.
Come tour with us.

955
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,119
You know you want to.

956
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,956
Put you down there.

957
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:13,996
All right, a little ginger ale.

958
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:17,102
I want you to drink some of this,
as much as you can.

959
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,665
How about some of that?
No, don't drink that yet, hang on.

960
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,003
Let's take this off, it's kind of damp.

961
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:33,585
And I wanna get you a fresh shirt.
Okay, can you help me with that?

962
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:37,519
All right, we'll find you
a different one.

963
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,594
- The pink one.
- What?

964
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,059
You don't have a pink one.
A nightshirt?

965
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:49,935
How about a purple kitty?
You want a purple kitty?

966
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:52,300
- My house.
- What?

967
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:56,808
Throw the pink one away.
I don't want Megan here.

968
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,080
All right, listen.

969
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,479
Tell Megan to go home.

970
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,779
Look at me for a second.
You okay?

971
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:12,182
Daddy. Hi. Okay, listen,
take some ginger ale.

972
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,022
I want you to drink that.
Drink as much as you can.

973
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,838
No worries.

974
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,033
Nice and quiet.

975
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:35,114
<i>Everybody's got the fever</i>

976
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,719
Dad!

977
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:49,227
Dad, I was calling you.
Didn't you hear me?

978
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:50,864
It's okay, sweetie.

979
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,000
Dad, I want some more milk.

980
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,236
- You can pour it yourself.
- I can't, it's too heavy.

981
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,066
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Say "please."

982
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,468
Please?

983
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,801
- Be down in a minute.
- It's always in a minute.

984
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,608
That's what you and Mommy always
say, "In a minute." Then you forget.

985
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,773
You're not the only one in this house.

986
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:13,284
- And you always say that too.
- Come here for a minute, please.

987
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,945
Stephanie has a high fever.

988
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,688
- Is it dangerous?
- No. It's not good...

989
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,590
...but it's not dangerous,
so I need you to help me.

990
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:25,563
Do me a favor and go ask Mommy
where she left the Children's Advil.

991
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:30,194
Mommy, where did Dad put the Advil?

992
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,542
Oh, shit.

993
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,539
I'm gonna need you to...

994
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,548
I need you to help me
the next 24 hours, okay?

995
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,311
- Do you think you can do that?
- My house.

996
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:49,480
<i>Shut up</i>
<i>Is she retarded?</i>

997
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:54,923
What do you mean?

998
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,322
Is it possible to die of the flu?
I'm asking you.

999
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,958
- <i>Is she very sick?</i>
- She has a temperature of 105.2.

1000
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,434
<i>How is she acting?</i>

1001
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,732
She's not acting any way,
she's asleep.

1002
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,034
- Don't wake her up.
- <i>Is she dehydrated?</i>

1003
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,908
She urinated around 10:30,
we gave her lots of fluids.

1004
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,980
- <i>Is she hallucinating?</i>
- She's asleep.

1005
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,481
- <i>Is she lethargic?</i>
- She's asleep, goddamn it!

1006
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,949
- <i>Bring her in, then, okay?</i>
- All right.

1007
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,988
Stephanie? Stephanie?
Can you wake up, honey?

1008
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,651
It's Mommy, sweetie.
Can you hear me?

1009
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:30,457
- Sweetie?
- I need you to wake up now, honey.

1010
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,323
- She's completely...
- You have to get up now.

1011
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:37,961
Hi. Come on up on Daddy's shoulder.
There we go. Good girl.

1012
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,073
I'm gonna take her in.

1013
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,232
- We packed Sammy.
- All right, thank you.

1014
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,844
- Stay upstairs with Leah, okay?
- Okay.

1015
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,543
Dave? Dave? Is she hurt?

1016
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,318
- Dave?
- No, don't come outside.

1017
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,449
- Who's that? Is that Lizzie's bike?
- Call me. If you want me to come over...

1018
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:00,855
No, honey, stay here.

1019
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,554
I can take Leah and Lizzie
over to Megan's house.

1020
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:07,167
That's a good girl. All right.

1021
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:11,335
I just know we're gonna feel like idiots
tomorrow when they release her.

1022
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:13,497
Good, watch your arm.

1023
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:16,573
- Call me, please.
- I'll call you.

1024
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,469
It's okay.

1025
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,949
Go back inside, honey.

1026
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,325
Steph?

1027
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,059
Honey? Steph?

1028
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:37,698
Stephie?

1029
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,991
Stephanie?

1030
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:43,860
What the hell is...?

1031
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,740
We'll be there in a minute, honey.
Hey, hey, we'll be there in a minute.

1032
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,611
Stay with me, you. Okay.

1033
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,522
Come on.

1034
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:09,960
Jesus Christ!

1035
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,197
Hello?

1036
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,421
Signey? Signey was the pushy one?

1037
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:37,524
You didn't like her,
she wanted you to stay in the bath?

1038
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,254
- Yeah.
- Is it Susan or Signey?

1039
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,988
I think it was Susan.

1040
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:47,362
Look what happened.
Look what you did.

1041
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:51,631
You owe me 100 bucks.
Here, hold on to that, hold on to that.

1042
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,269
You scared us.

1043
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:03,248
You know something? This stuff
should be the Italian sprouts.

1044
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,294
- What's your monster's name, huh?
- Diarrhea!

1045
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:17,192
Diarrhea?

1046
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,690
Just like you said.

1047
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,156
Five days, right on the nose.

1048
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,308
- Cut it out.
- I don't wanna believe it.

1049
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:45,747
You think I like this?

1050
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,285
No Dana yet, huh?

1051
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:51,482
No, she called. She canceled
her appointments. Didn't you know?

1052
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,121
Maybe she told me
and I wasn't listening.

1053
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,628
I called Mark and told him
not to come in.

1054
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,791
- Okay, see you guys.
- See you.

1055
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:04,394
- You believe me now?
- No.

1056
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:06,672
Yes.

1057
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,524
I just wanna murder him sometimes.

1058
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:28,093
Yeah, his own sister
doesn't even like him.

1059
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,059
You know what he did?

1060
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,623
- Come on, what? Tell me.
- I'll tell you outside.

1061
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:35,928
- Come on, tell me, please?
- Welcome home.

1062
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,629
Just tell me, please?

1063
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,330
Tell me.

1064
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:49,809
Take your own.

1065
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,553
Napkins, ladies.

1066
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,790
Okay?

1067
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:06,024
- Where's Mom?
- I don't know.

1068
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,431
I don't know, guys.

1069
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,571
It's okay.

1070
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:26,549
Say yes, say yes, say yes.

1071
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,882
No, say no, Leah, no.

1072
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:31,524
Say yes, say yes, say yes.

1073
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:33,990
- No, say no, say no.
- Say yes.

1074
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:35,686
Say no.

1075
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,161
- Say yes, Leah.
- Say no.

1076
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,857
- Say yes.
- Careful with her neck, guys.

1077
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:42,798
Say no.

1078
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:46,231
- Oh, look, the boys.
- Powerpuff Boys.

1079
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:48,238
- The Powerpuff Boys.
- She's like:

1080
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:51,537
- The Rowdyruff Boys.
- The Roundywuff Boys?

1081
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:54,704
The Rowdyruff Boys.

1082
01:31:33,387 --> 01:31:35,617
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

1083
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:44,962
In.

1084
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:49,199
There we go.

1085
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:51,933
Good night, sweetheart.

1086
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:53,971
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1087
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:55,574
Good night.

1088
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:58,505
Good night.

1089
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,059
What?

1090
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,257
Why are you so devoted to this?

1091
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,661
You wouldn't understand it.

1092
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:33,277
- Marriage is impossible, David.
- You really believe that?

1093
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:50,257
Listen to me.

1094
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:54,999
In some way, it's why I went through
the whole ordeal of college...

1095
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:56,534
...dental school...

1096
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,968
- Eight years.
- Nine years.

1097
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,540
Taking out loans, saving.

1098
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:04,007
- High school.
- Putting up with my father.

1099
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:05,509
- Everything.
- Everything.

1100
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,376
- For this.
- To have this.

1101
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,414
What I have.

1102
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,448
Had?

1103
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,657
Well.

1104
01:33:54,895 --> 01:33:57,125
<i>Wait! What hurts?</i>

1105
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,061
<i>Everything.</i>

1106
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:02,292
- <i>because Pocket Fisherman</i>
<i>can hang on your belt.</i>

1107
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,496
<i>Casting is so easy with</i>
<i>the Popeil Pocket Fisherman.</i>

1108
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:09,131
<i>And, boy, you can catch</i>
<i>all kinds of great fighting fish.</i>

1109
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,302
<i>Pocket Fisherman is also</i>
<i>great fun for adults too.</i>

1110
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,472
<i>In fact, the Popeil Pocket Fish</i>...

1111
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:15,634
Well, until last night I thought...

1112
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:20,046
...I might be misreading
the signals somehow.

1113
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,284
No?

1114
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:38,464
How are the girls? Are they okay?

1115
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:42,601
Who is he?

1116
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,931
Worried about you.

1117
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:47,165
- Who is he?
- And I'll ask the questions.

1118
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:49,138
- Okay.
- Okay.

1119
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:02,517
Are you leaving or staying?

1120
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:12,196
I'm staying.

1121
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:19,838
Are you sure?

1122
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:46,063
Daddy! Daddy!

1123
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:50,794
Just a minute, sweetie.

1124
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,445
Daddy! Daddy!

1125
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:00,341
You go.

1126
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,851
I just make her cry harder.

1127
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:22,158
I don't want to know who it is.

1128
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:25,334
I don't want to know what you did.

1129
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:28,475
- Daddy!
- Daddy's coming, honey.

1130
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,037
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

1131
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,578
- Daddy.
- Good morning, sweetie.

1132
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,854
- Mommy!
- Hi.

1133
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,847
Hi.

1134
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:46,482
Mommy!

1135
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:20,450
The girls will be up soon.

1136
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:48,479
<i>Teeth.</i>

1137
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:53,223
<i>Two little rows of stones</i>
<i>in the flesh...</i>

1138
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:57,455
<i>... but as sensitive in their own way</i>
<i>as fingertips.</i>

1139
01:38:57,631 --> 01:38:59,258
<i>Or lips.</i>

1140
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,169
<i>Impossible.</i>

1141
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:06,066
<i>Like marriage.</i>

1142
01:39:07,074 --> 01:39:08,871
<i>But there they are.</i>

1143
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:20,180
How are they?

1144
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,981
I'll tell you in a while.

1145
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:28,461
Open.
