1
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,790
Ty?

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,759
Oh I was a naughty boy this year!

3
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,430
Holy shit!

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,429
Ho Ho Ho!

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,277
Hey, Ho!

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,035
What the hell are you doing there?

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,234
Waking your ass is up. You got the
audition I wanted but didn't get,

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,119
so fuck if I'm gonna let you sleep
through it.

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,676
Oh shit!

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,429
End of a sublet, end of an era.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,230
I know, right.

12
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,153
Are you guys here for callbacks?

13
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,271
Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,309
Oh cool, thanks.

15
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,758
Hi, how's it going? Umm. Tyler Hall.
I should have a 10:30am audition?

16
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,232
Ooh hunny, you are late!
Come around here.

17
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,156
sorry.

18
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,511
Tyler Hall is here.

19
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,273
Tyler Hall is at 10:30. I dunn-

20
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,596
I know he's late but he's fine.

21
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,151
Hi Tyler. I'm Amy Lynn,
the casting director.

22
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,396
Have you had a chance to
look over the sides?

23
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,155
Yeah, I'm off book.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,356
Fabulous. I'll be reading with you. In
a moment we'll have you slate for the

25
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,438
camera with your name and phone
number and we'll get started

26
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,396
whenever you're ready.

27
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,476
Fred?

28
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,756
We all set there?

29
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,635
Um, yeah. Yup, we are all set.

30
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,236
Great!

31
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,037
Ok.

32
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,313
Tyler Hall, 212-555-9532.

33
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,390
Hey, Ty!

34
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,471
How'd it go?

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,750
What the hell are you two doing?

36
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,830
He's trying to button my new jeans
from Barney's sample sale.

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,955
Why don't you just buy
clothes that fit?

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,911
You're not going to get anyone's
attention with clothes that fit.

39
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,716
We're getting ready for Tea at G.
Hey, I rhymed!

40
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,549
Hey! Walt Witless.

41
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,310
Come with us, it's going to be hotness
over there, all picante and shit.

42
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,838
Hallelujah, Mary, success. Don't
you dare unbutton these.

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,629
Don't worry, they're not coming off
until they need to ... like an hour.

44
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,909
Ty! Come out with us for a twirl!

45
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,354
Thank you but I'm going to pass.
I'm going to go get some sleep.

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,469
sleep when you're dead! Or, like, 25.

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,710
Good night queens.

48
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,275
Oh no she didn't.. Oh yes she did.

49
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,832
OK, Ty, I'll be back later! I'm taking
out the trash with me!

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,796
Bitch!

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,915
see you later Ty!

52
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,271
Have fun.

53
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,955
(Bear Growl)

54
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,912
(Men Moaning)

55
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,476
Ty?

56
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,948
Ty?!

57
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,438
shit.

58
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,477
Ty! Bring your ass out here!

59
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,591
simon, you seem to have this inability
to knock before entering.

60
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,270
Whatever, you have to see the two
hotties Cory and I just brought back!

61
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,075
They're actual Abercrombie models -
Mormons from sandy, Utah, and they're

62
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,430
going to show us their magical
underwear!

63
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,750
No, I have plans.

64
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,239
What plans could you possibly have
that would be better than Big Love?

65
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,070
Hey, there's a bear on your shirt.

66
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,039
son, there's a bear in my shirt.

67
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,598
Go on kid. We don't bite.

68
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,632
Hey. Member or non?

69
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,517
Um, non.

70
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,750
That'll be eight dollars.

71
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,910
I'll get that.

72
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,716
No, it's ok. I got it.

73
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,630
You can get the first drink.

74
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,550
The drinks are free.

75
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,676
I meant at breakfast.

76
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,630
Wow, NYC-style romance! Ok, um..
Do I get a name, too?

77
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,035
Greg. Greg styles.

78
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,350
Tyler Hall.

79
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:57,275
Tyler. You look like a Tyler. Bet
you taste like a Tyler, too.

80
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,991
Hey Tyler! I'm so glad you made it.

81
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,159
Uh, hey!

82
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,679
Thanks for the warm welcome, Greg,
as always. We gotta go.

83
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,314
Trust me. You don't want to know that
one. He's got a partner. And a trick.

84
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,990
And a trick. And a trick. sensing a
pattern here?

85
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,672
Yeah, sure. He's Hairy Fucking Potter.

86
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,590
Weasel-y, actually. You're funny.

87
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,594
Thanks. Improv class did me wonders.

88
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,109
Clearly. You were really good today.

89
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,118
Hey boys, what're you drinking?

90
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,230
Two beers, please.

91
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,598
You uh.. You think they liked me?

92
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,799
shit, I'd cast you. But I'm just a
cameraman, not much of a director.

93
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,075
C'mon. Let me introduce you
to my entourage.

94
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,069
Hey guys. This is Tyler.

95
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,030
Hi, I'm Michael...

96
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,070
... and this is my boyfriend, Carlos.

97
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,236
Hey, what's up man?

98
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,634
And this is my huzbear, Brent.

99
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,634
Aww, huzbear? Oh, that's.. alright.

100
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,634
Uh, there's a term for everything
in this scene.

101
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,670
Hey Michael, hey baby, looking good.

102
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,273
Hey! Don't squeeze the Charmin,
papa! Ok?

103
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,473
see?! see what I have to deal
with all the time.

104
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,635
It's ok, it's ok.

105
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,108
Tyler, so how do you know Fred?

106
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,915
We met at the auditions today -
the kid's a future star.

107
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,195
Ahh.. shia LaCub.

108
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,119
Anyone? No?

109
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,438
Hardly, I'm studying acting and hoping
to turn that into an actual paying

110
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,673
career. Maybe landing a sex scene with
Kevin James while I'm at it.

111
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Well, this is the town where
careers are made, my boy!

112
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,998
And deals with horny producers.

113
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,910
Hey! Let's go guys. I am getting
mauled back here, come on.

114
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,310
Randy, thank God. I was worried.
I thought you got lost.

115
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,673
One more for my friend, Tyler here.

116
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,998
Uhh, who ordered the Bear Claws?

117
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,669
strawberry shortcake over here.

118
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,391
What's a Bear Claw?

119
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,675
Oh dude, you'll love it.

120
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,353
Uh, to New York!

121
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,229
Ah yes, cheers.

122
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,675
Oh god!

123
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,190
Damn.

124
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,716
Uhh! That'll put some
hair on your chest!

125
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,911
I'll put some hair on your chest, boy.

126
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,635
Hey Randy, I think you
overshot over here.

127
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,717
You wish... that one's for Roger.

128
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,431
Oh, where is Roger?

129
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,716
Hey, what's BEARCITY?

130
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,476
Do you know that book by Dante about
the circle of hell and infernos?

131
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,108
Oh I'm sorry, have you met jaded?

132
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,955
What? I'll show you jaded.

133
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,753
Oh yeah? Please, do show me jaded.

134
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,633
- Alright...
- Lay it on me.

135
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,556
Woof!

136
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,670
Woof!

137
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,074
It's this bear weekend at the end of
the summer. You know, bar-hopping,

138
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,035
bed-hopping, sweaty shirtless hairy
men dancing... it's awesome.

139
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,115
I've actually never been to a bear
event before. But, well.. Any bear

140
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,279
event before whatsoever since tonight
if that's not already obvious...

141
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,593
Well, then you're definitely coming
with us. It's like a summer camp

142
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,109
reunion with all the guys you haven't
seen in months.

143
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,318
And like a parade of the proud studs
that finally made it into Roger's

144
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,350
playroom this year.

145
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,393
Damn, who is this Roger already?

146
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,031
''Damn'' is usually what most people
say when they see him.

147
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,309
Ehh. He's not that hot.

148
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,677
He's like that hot daddy you
see with their kids,

149
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,194
that you just want to pounce on.

150
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,270
stroller meat.

151
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,875
Yes, exactly! And he just won Mr. New
York Daddybear this year.

152
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,711
sash queen!

153
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,636
What is wrong with you?

154
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,879
Well, Michael and Carlos went home to
cuddle. so, I suggest we follow suit.

155
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,354
They're cute, do they.. uh.. do they
''play well with others?''

156
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,237
No, no. Those two are like lesbians,
just without the drum circles.

157
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,071
Well so are we, that's what we are..

158
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,756
OK, for the record..

159
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,794
..no more Bear Claws for the
lightweight who stole my heart.

160
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,229
Of course we're monogamous, baby.

161
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,838
Ohh, oh. Gotta put the ad on
the bulletin board.

162
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,956
Oh, yeah. shit, I almost forgot.

163
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,429
What's the ad for?

164
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,517
We have a two bedroom, we
rent out the extra bedroom.

165
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,430
We lost our friend Tony to a big
red-headed bear from Texas.

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,915
Yeah, Texas-sized, as they say. Why?
You lookin' for a place?

167
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,038
Last call boys! Drink 'em up.

168
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,112
He's fine.

169
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,275
I understand that.

170
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:56,637
Besides you ought to take it as a
compliment. Come here.

171
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,035
I ain't with him, I'm with you.

172
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,516
I know. I know. Oh baby,
how's your knee?

173
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,078
Better. You want me to
get down on 'em.

174
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,157
Oh gordito, I just love you so much.

175
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,790
I love you too, Carlito. Oh, how was
softball?

176
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,638
I'm so sorry I missed the game.

177
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,268
Oh it was fine. It wasn't the same
with out my cheering section though.

178
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,148
I'm your whole cheering section?

179
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,356
You're my whole world.

180
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,996
You're so sweet.

181
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,078
seriously. I'm sorry about getting
jealous. It's just guys like that,

182
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,190
I know what they see.

183
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,269
400 pounds of prime beef?

184
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,230
No, I mean it. Gordito I look at you
and I see you and I see how beautiful

185
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,032
you are. Inside and out.

186
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,432
I better see the inside out of this
shirt at the foot of my bed

187
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,073
in about 40 seconds.

188
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,391
Ok.

189
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,515
Oh, I love when you do that.

190
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,668
Oh! Wait, wait, wait. These are the
interviews for next week.

191
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,831
Dammit. Just gimme a minute.
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,990
It's ok. Take your time.

193
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,678
I haven't been without a job since I
was 18 and comparatively sprightly.

194
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,556
You're gonna find work baby, ok.
Just calm down, you are.

195
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,478
That's easy for you to say. Talk to me
again in

196
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,238
10 years and 100 more pounds from now.

197
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,679
Oh yeah... you're really turning
me on now.

198
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,350
Oh, stop kidding around.

199
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,590
Carlos, I think I'm going to
have the surgery.

200
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,073
so you're going to get your
stomach stapled?

201
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,874
They don't staple it anymore, they use
a rubber band, a lap band it's called.

202
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,672
I knew you wouldn't understand.

203
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,871
Of course I don't understand, gordito!
Ok, cause that kind of treatment is

204
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,311
for people with health problems. Not
self-worth problems.

205
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,193
Carlos, I need a job.

206
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,076
And what? What you think that being
fucking thin is going to somehow make

207
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,554
you magically employable?

208
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,638
I think you need to go to
your apartment tonight.

209
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,195
Gordito, please don't do this.
Come on.

210
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,115
Just go.

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,956
Was he understanding
when you told him?

212
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,275
I mean, simon doesn't really listen as
much as he just waits for you to stop

213
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,469
talking so that he can start.

214
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,115
Oh, I fucking hate people like that.

215
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,196
I know but he was.. I don't blame him,
he was pissed you know.

216
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,116
Yeah.

217
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,356
We were supposed to be moving into
this two-bedroom apartment with him

218
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,236
and this twink. I could not picture
myself spending another yearjerking

219
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,750
off to bear porn because I'm too
afraid to bring a real guy home. Plus

220
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,396
when you're in Chelsea, if your waist
size is over 36 the Chelsea police

221
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,956
turn your ass around at 23rd street
and send you packing back to Hell's

222
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,797
Kitchen.

223
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,148
Isn't Hell's Kitchen getting just as
bad. Aren't they calling it Helsea?

224
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,270
Oh, watch the curb.

225
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,230
Oh shit.

226
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,988
It's not tough enough, It's like
admitting that you..

227
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,276
Oh, shit. I'm sorry dude.

228
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,875
...admitting that you know you like
bears is like is like coming out of

229
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,671
the closet twice.

230
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,989
I know. It's one thing to say you
think Brad Pitt's hot, but try saying

231
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,151
you want a mouthful of John Goodman.

232
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,789
Exactly. Like the other day I even had
a dream that I was having sex with a

233
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,232
guy in a santa Claus outfit and simon
walked in and caught us.

234
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,753
Ohh. Did he stuff your stocking?

235
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,155
Yes. santa comes more than once
a year in my dreams.

236
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,793
No joke, no joke. Michael's boyfriend
Carlos had a department store santa as

237
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,231
a fuckbuddy - hooked us up with a
thirty percent discount.

238
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,639
Wow. Friends with below retail
benefits. God, I love it!

239
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,317
Uh, I think I'm done. Umm. It's mostly
everything. so, I can take it from

240
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,192
here if you wanna head up.

241
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,916
OK, I'm going to wake up sleeping
booty and see if I can't get some...

242
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,271
All this fantasy talk has made me
kinda horny.

243
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,276
Me, too.

244
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,792
Hey! There's still some room!

245
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,555
Uhh. There's a few more things that
I umm..I'm sorry.

246
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,750
I uh.. just jokin'!

247
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,359
You have no idea. Truck stop was off
the hook. It was outrageous. They have

248
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,834
this huge, huge hot tub.

249
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,273
That's Ted and the glam bears.

250
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,234
Umm, glam bears... define.

251
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,396
Nay. They're actually muscle bears.
It's just what I call guys like that.

252
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,751
They make me feel insecure because
they have perfect bodies, perfect

253
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,757
boots, perfect beards and all that.

254
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,951
Woof.

255
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,797
Oh, barf.

256
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,950
Wow, uh jaded cappuccino with a
double shot of hate and despair.

257
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,793
You. Make that up all by yourself?

258
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,558
It's an original piece that
I'm working on.

259
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,476
Is it? Is it really?

260
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,037
No, but seriously, Brent. Thank you,
very much.

261
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,629
It's really appreciated,
I need this job.

262
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,831
Oh well, the job sucks. Don't worry
about that,

263
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,632
but the eye candy is compensation.

264
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,396
I'll say - hard candy by
the looks of it.

265
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,239
Oh, no, no, that's Robbie. We call her
Ruby because of the slippers that will

266
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,714
fall out her mouth when she speaks.

267
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,511
Hey, lover!

268
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,709
Girl!

269
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,757
Hunny, you look fabulous. Do a little
twirl, so I can take a look at ya!

270
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,436
Uh huh. Like the wig?

271
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,311
Uh..

272
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,559
Can I have a search party sent out for
the hard-on that I just lost?

273
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,551
Harsh.

274
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,790
That was rough, right?

275
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,150
It was mean and not funny. Well..

276
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,395
Can I get some service over here?

277
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,355
shut up, you polar bear! I'm going to
go tend to her

278
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,709
before she goes extinct.

279
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,635
Hey Roger. What's up?

280
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,555
How you doin?

281
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,670
Good, man. How you' doing?

282
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,596
What's up?

283
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,516
Look who it is.

284
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,437
What's up babe?

285
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,596
Oh la la.

286
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,596
Oh hey baby.

287
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,637
When am I gonna get a piece of that?

288
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,470
Look at that bod.

289
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,116
Coffeehouse Massacre. Film at 1 1.

290
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,476
This thing hates me.

291
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,630
It hates me too, that's why I stay on
this side of the counter.

292
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,592
Can I get a Black-Eye?

293
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,629
Left hook or right hook?

294
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,510
It's a coffee with two
shots of espresso.

295
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,630
Oh, gotcha. Just thought maybe that's
how they did it here

296
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,671
at the leather bars. I'm new.

297
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,473
And I'm used. Keep the change.

298
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,397
There they are. Gentlemen.

299
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,233
surprise, surprise.

300
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,557
Tyra, Tyler. I'm going to take a
break, ok? Did you meet Roger?

301
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,076
Uh yeah. Not formally but he ordered
a busted lip or something.

302
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,355
Black-Eye?

303
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,276
Yeah.

304
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,755
sure. Good. Oh can I get an Iced
coffee and a Decaf Iced coffee for

305
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,996
Michael and a Latte for Fred. Thank
You!

306
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,634
Um. Contrary to the actor's cliche, I
still don't know how

307
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,556
to use any of this equipment.

308
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,471
Can't hear you, I'm on break.

309
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,956
Hi guys. Oh, Daddy's home. so put your
toys away or

310
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,832
I'm going to have to confiscate them.

311
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,990
You're so mean.

312
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,239
Actually, I think Daddy brought some
toys of his own for show and tell.

313
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,159
What'd I miss?

314
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,350
We were just pondering the
hypothetical question of what it would

315
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,111
cost to get Roger to Nair his entire
body. A million bucks?

316
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,718
A million dollars tax-free so you
won't end up like Richard Hatch.

317
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,471
Fuck no. My hair is my mating call.
Let's move on to letting the cat out

318
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,477
of the bag, shall we?

319
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,551
Hey, what are these?

320
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,637
Please tell me those are
metal chopsticks.

321
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,550
Well, they could be used on Chinese,
just not the food per se.

322
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,509
You know what those are?
Do you know what those are?

323
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,070
They ain't for knittin'.

324
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,955
It's a set of sounds.

325
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,720
A set of sounds.. alright, I give up.
What's a sound?

326
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,712
so glad you asked, Brent.

327
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,272
What are you doing?

328
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,555
Patience, my boy!

329
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:58,114
so, imagine, if you will, that this is
your cock and this is the hole.

330
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,159
Oh...

331
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,755
Breath, breath.

332
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,197
No..

333
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,117
Oh God, I get the sound part.
What is wrong with cuddling?

334
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,030
Oh, shit!

335
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,877
Tyler, what are you doing?

336
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,753
I'm sorry, I spilled the Evil Eye all
over myself when I saw the sounds.

337
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,632
Is this a cafe or a sex club?

338
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,076
You know what those are?

339
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,036
Yeah.

340
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,232
Is this the Tyler that just moved
in with you guys?

341
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,950
The same.

342
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,557
Tough first day kid. I'm Roger.

343
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,273
Hi, I'm humiliated. Nice to meet you.

344
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,878
Tyler, Tyler! I'll clean it.
I'll clean it, I will clean it.

345
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,273
You go in the back and put a shirt on
before you get raped.

346
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,032
That's one way to pick up business.

347
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,470
Hey!

348
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,959
At least they made her pretty.

349
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,596
Now don't be mean.
He's new to the scene.

350
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,669
Now that is so cute! You guys
got yourself an in-house chaser.

351
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,110
That'll spice things up a little bit.

352
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,912
We don't need no spicing up, Rachael
Ray, we're yummo as it is.

353
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,277
so, Michael, where's Carlos?

354
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,591
Guys... Umm, Carlos and I have decided
to take a little break.

355
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,830
What happened?

356
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,677
We just need time to reevaluate.

357
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,229
sweetie, I'm so sorry to hear that.

358
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,633
Me too. Me Too.

359
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,957
But right now I'm focused on
getting a job by the Fall.

360
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,638
Now wait, do you need help
financially? Fuck you bitches.

361
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,399
Well you asked!

362
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,635
I'll be fine, I'll be fine. But I
ain't payin' for the coffee.

363
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,229
Oh this shit's free now.

364
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,192
Tyler that was amazing.

365
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,636
Dude, I am so sorry.

366
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,631
You're totally fired.

367
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,153
I'm just kidding. Here's an extra
small. I'm kidding, it's a large.

368
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,313
stop. Roger must think
I'm such a douche.

369
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,312
No, no, no. Don't' worry. We'll get
you up to speed. show you how to work

370
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,637
the tray, how to not drop things, work
with milk, not give anyone espresso

371
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,115
conjunctivitis. You don't know what
that is right?

372
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,516
It's bacterial infection.

373
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,869
Oh cool.

374
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,915
Do you think that Fred's cute?

375
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,791
Yeah, I mean I think you're
both adorable. Why?

376
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,437
No reason.

377
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,078
Hey! Is anyone working here?!

378
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,317
shut the fuck up Mary! Don't get
your panties in a bunch!

379
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,439
It's our four year anniversary
in two weeks..

380
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,875
Yes.

381
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,832
And I was just.. Oh yes, four.

382
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,160
Four! Four years baby and I was just
thinking about how ideal this is you

383
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,434
know? I never really believed in that
whole soulmate bullshit. It didn't

384
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,760
seem like anything that could actually
happen. But now I know it can.

385
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,757
Yay.

386
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,159
I love that we are so in sync with
each other, you know.

387
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,230
Me too.

388
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,755
We have our own language, we finish
each other's sentences.

389
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,718
We are impenetrable.

390
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,920
Do you think we should ''spice it up''
as Roger says?

391
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,358
Wait. Well, where did that
come from? Do you?

392
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,551
No, I'm perfectly happy
with our routine.

393
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,749
Oh my god, a routine.

394
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,353
Not routine, sweetheart. You
know what I meant.

395
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,393
No, I don't. Please define it for me,
in urban dictionary terms.

396
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,671
What?

397
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,790
Ok.

398
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,115
Well how long have you been
thinking about this?

399
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,476
About what?

400
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,272
My mother says if you say something
once you probably thought it twice.

401
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,596
Yeah, which is complete
bullshit.

402
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,989
You callin' my mother a liar?

403
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,955
I have a few choice adjectives if
you're asking. Don't, sweetheart. You

404
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,518
know I love your mother...can we leave
her out of this conversation, please?

405
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,992
Ok, so are there rules? This is
hypothetically speaking, of course.

406
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,232
Yeah, hypothetically speaking, we
would have to decide what we do and

407
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,032
don't want to do with other people.

408
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,915
Alright, like what Dennis and Peter
do. so.. 'No kissing.'

409
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,876
Oh..

410
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,031
You're in my ear. Oh...
that's it. What...

411
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,553
Ahh, is that.. gorgeous, that..

412
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,554
Well that is completely retarded. I
don't know how they make that work.

413
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,109
Ok.. stupid. Uhh.. Chris and.. What is
that thing they do, Chris and Andy?

414
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,516
Veto power.

415
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,595
Oh.. Yay!

416
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,231
Nay.

417
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,952
What are you blind?

418
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,669
- Nay.
- Yay.

419
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,154
- Nay.
- You didn't even look.

420
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,157
Whatever.

421
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,430
Nay..

422
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,830
But I hear he has a donkey dick.

423
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,832
Ok, that's got divorce written
all over it.

424
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,831
soooo..

425
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,479
''no fucking?''

426
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,477
Yeah.

427
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,593
Yes. Ah, well that's the pickle,
isn't it?

428
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,191
Is it? It makes the most sense to me-
it's the most intimate, and its the

429
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,116
most risky.

430
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,117
I wish I had never brought this up.

431
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,677
Why?! Because of ''no fucking''? Can't
figure out how to not fuck?

432
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,639
sounds perfect in theory but the
ultimate question becomes not whether

433
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,193
you can live with it...

434
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,677
Oh baby....

435
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,868
...it's whether you can live up to it.

436
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,269
You ok?

437
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,269
Fuck yeah.

438
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,310
Well I guess then it's just
like cheating.

439
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,035
Hmm. I think I have something
that you could live with.

440
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,435
Thanks for coming with me, Rodge.
It really means a lot to me.

441
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,272
Mick, shut up. I've known
you for how long?

442
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,156
On a Creationism or evolutionary
timeline?

443
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,039
Exactly, Methuselah.

444
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,879
Cruising the waiting room,
Roger? Really?

445
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,870
so, what happened yesterday that
prompted this little office visit?

446
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,957
Not that I'm complaining.

447
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,596
Can we focus on me for one
second, please?

448
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,951
Focusing.

449
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,359
It's not just yesterday, I've been
thinking about this

450
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,879
ever since I got laid off.

451
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,308
It's only been a couple of months.

452
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,351
Yeah, but every interview
goes the same way.

453
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,191
I'm sorry, Mr. McCarthy, but we're
looking for someone with a little more

454
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,632
energy who can really take on the
workload. And you seem qualified for

455
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,198
sure and if things expand around here
then I'll be sure to give you a call.

456
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,676
I know you can't say it openly because
of equal opportunity laws, but you're

457
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,111
right, my big fat ass probably would
crush a lot of your fancy, expensive

458
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,957
chairs.

459
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm sorry?

460
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,272
And there was one other thing I
forgot to put on my resume. Bing!

461
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,753
Do you always go ''And Justice
For All'' on them?

462
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,154
No, just yesterday.

463
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,278
Mr. McCarthy?

464
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,432
Yes. Here. C'mon.

465
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,635
I'm Roger.

466
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,030
I'm Paul.

467
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,709
Hey, Paul.

468
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,355
Roger?!

469
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,476
Daddy's testy.

470
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,556
I know the feeling.

471
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,677
sorry.

472
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,596
stop it! Oh my God, Rodge.
Put the organ back.

473
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,712
Mick, I don't know about this.

474
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,358
It looks worse than it is. Michael?

475
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,276
Yes.

476
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,230
Roger.

477
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,831
This procedure was regarded as a last
resort for the highest risk

478
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,034
individuals, people whose health and
lives were in absolute jeopardy, but

479
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,198
now exists within the elective
category.

480
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,237
How long would it take for me
to visibly lose weight?

481
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,159
You'd be shopping for a new
belt within a week.

482
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,668
That's amazing.

483
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,512
Yes, it's exciting. You'll be amazed
at how it will impact your life.

484
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,193
That's what I'm counting on, doc.

485
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,077
OK, wait. Can we talk about side
effects, risks, how does this work?

486
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,957
Top line, we make five small incisions
in the patient's stomach.

487
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,955
And then we use those incision points
to place, essentially, a rubber band

488
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,957
around the patient's stomach.

489
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,590
Mick, are you crazy?

490
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,596
Just listen.

491
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,799
It sounds worse than it is.

492
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,638
Yeah, you keep saying that.

493
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,115
I urge you to read this. It answers
common questions that people have. I

494
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,630
assure you, your partner will be in
good hands.

495
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,679
Well, just reassure me, doc - will
my partner still be able to guzzle?

496
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,914
Thanks for coming and bringing
your caring nature.

497
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,474
I just want you to be happy.

498
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,959
I know. I just wish Carlos was
understanding. Instead, he told me

499
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,310
he didn't sign up for a thin guy.

500
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,278
Well he's right.

501
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,276
What?

502
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,954
Carlos didn't settle for your body,
Michael, he's attracted to it. That's

503
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,151
how this whole community got started
in the first place.

504
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,715
Can we not do the whole bear
community rah-rah discussion, please?

505
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,995
Fine. Just think about it a little
before you totally write him off.

506
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,595
I will.

507
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,910
Good.

508
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,394
I will!

509
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,955
Yes!

510
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,069
Impressive.

511
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,270
Me? Your shoes match your bag.

512
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,158
Well, intimidation is half
the game my boy.

513
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,551
Really, it's refreshing to see
a young man like you into the sport.

514
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,836
I used to play on a father-son league
when I was a kid out in Philadelphia,

515
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,556
used to get a dollar for every strike.
But I.. But, what about you?

516
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,038
same, same. I played with my father as
a boy as well, back in the quarter per

517
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,310
strike days. I'm in the Bear League in
an hour. You should think about

518
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,239
joining. You're not half-bad.

519
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,990
Half-bad? Ok, I hope you have a roll
of dollar bills in your pocket, daddy.

520
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,751
Don't you worry about
what's in my pocket,

521
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,349
just reset the board and
grab your ankles, kid!

522
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,553
Well, Rog, It looks like I'm just one
strike away from kicking your ass.

523
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,756
As long as you don't choke.

524
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,915
Choke? Ha! You wish, grandpa!

525
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,833
You're doing an awful lot of talking,
I see Grandma's teeth in your future.

526
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,318
Oh really, do you? Ok well
get ready for the splasher!

527
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,999
splasher?

528
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,954
Oh shit.

529
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,073
Ouch, oh the dreaded bedposts.

530
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,069
Well Tyler, you know what,
the good news is,

531
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,756
If you get this spare,
you'll win.

532
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,150
Funny.

533
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,716
Tyler.

534
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,995
What?

535
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,152
Angle your approach more.

536
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,115
Oh come on, Roger. What's the
difference? This shot's impossible.

537
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:45,516
Now look you'll have to give it a lot
of crank but it's not impossible. Come

538
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,955
here. Just shoot for that second dart
from here.

539
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,439
swing out, and give it some lift,
you can make this.

540
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,557
Have you ever made this?

541
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,876
No... but there's a first
time for everything.

542
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,956
snake eyes! somebody's
fucked without spit.

543
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,669
Teddy bear, where we at?

544
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,792
Oh we're in the graveyard, but we're
playin' a bunch of those pastel Care

545
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,831
Bears so it should be easy.
Who's the kid?

546
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,112
Oh, uh, it's um,
Bert and Ernie's roommate.

547
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,193
I'm not interrupting anything am I?

548
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,474
No, come on. I've got a
reputation to uphold.

549
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,997
You know, it looks like if the kid
makes the unmakeable split he could

550
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,671
take you. Ten bucks says the kid makes
the split and kicks your ass.

551
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,790
Fuck you.

552
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,230
Come on kid, show us
what you got.

553
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,236
C'mon Ty.

554
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,236
C'mon Ty.

555
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,996
Do it.

556
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,239
Wow, the kid can crank!

557
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,159
Ahh, better luck next time, kid.
C'mon, Rog, recess is over. Let's go

558
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,271
cream some Care Bear ass.

559
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,396
Oh!

560
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,710
Ohh. Oh oh, get the yellow one.

561
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,910
I don't need it.

562
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,111
Up, up, up.. ooh.

563
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,755
Get the blue one.

564
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,676
stop.

565
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,352
Go, go, go.

566
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,798
Who's playing this game, you or me?

567
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,319
You want to tell me what's wrong?

568
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,317
sure...

569
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,069
I love you, Gobo.

570
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,949
I love you too, Wembley.

571
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,592
And I don't want to
open the relationship.

572
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,196
Alright, then we won't.

573
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,230
Is that alright with you?

574
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,596
Is it alright with you?

575
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,437
I asked you first.

576
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,593
Oh! saved by the Twinkie.

577
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,395
Hi.

578
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,833
What the fuck is up mother fuckers?

579
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,915
I'm gonna go take a piss
and I'll be right back.

580
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,794
The kid's drunk.

581
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,918
We'll talk about this later?

582
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,953
Yeah, it'll probably be better.
We'll watch a movie.

583
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,909
Where'd you go?

584
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,030
(BURPs)

585
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,434
Eww.

586
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,069
Heineken or Pabst?

587
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,592
Yup, I went to the beer
blast at the Eagle.

588
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,630
Yeah, we figured.

589
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,271
Oh, I told everyone how handsome that
you both are and how nice you're being

590
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,677
to me. Oh, and I went to an audition,
and booked it.

591
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,116
No, you didn't.

592
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,469
shut up. Uh, and I went bowling,
but I'm not talking about it.

593
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,396
Oh?

594
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,669
I said I'm not talking about it.

595
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,197
Alright we're about to start the
greatest Jennifer Lopez movie ever.

596
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,389
Oh, ''Out of sight''?

597
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,350
''selena''.

598
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,109
Oh, anything for selena.

599
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,915
Oh yeah! Let's have a little slumber
party. We'll cuddle up between two

600
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,189
bears and watch.

601
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,197
No, we were going to do it alone.

602
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,756
Brent?

603
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,679
Oh, no it's fine. It's fine.
I have to go to bed anyway.

604
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,233
No no sweetheart.

605
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,193
No, no, no. You sit right back down,
this is your house now too.

606
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,714
Alright, well I'll order Chinese
for three people.

607
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,672
Oh, do Pu Pu platter.

608
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,438
Oh yeah, Kung Pow.

609
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,194
Holy shit!

610
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,800
Oh no no no.

611
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,869
Oh no no no.

612
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,195
Oh God!

613
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,879
Why would you do that?

614
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,230
A bear is a terrible thing to waste.

615
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,556
Ok, what do you fraggets want?

so what are you bitches having?

632
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,635
Do you have anything organic, or
overpriced from Whole Foods? You do?

633
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,756
Can I just have a sausage
with no bun? Cue.

634
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,549
Oh ah, God, um.. sausage, bun, meat,
barbecue, insert joke.

635
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,518
sorry, I don't have anything.

636
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,997
Are you sure?

637
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,355
I'm sure.

638
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,357
Daddy's got some big hot
sizzling meat here.

639
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,034
Oh thank you, there it is.

640
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,194
I'm not that hungry.

641
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,196
Yeah, come on Michael, don't be shy.

642
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,509
I mean, who knows. This could
be your last supper, no?

643
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,033
Carlos, what are you doing here?

644
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,432
Oh what? so I'm an outcast now? Is
that what you're gonna do to all of

645
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,359
your friends once you're thin enough
to join the White Party?

646
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,909
This is really inappropriate, baby.

647
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,151
Thin enough for what?

648
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,237
Yeah, Carlos. What
are you talking about?

649
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,952
Oh so, I guess you didn't tell them.

650
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,550
Carlos, shut the fuck up.

651
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,636
Ok, well of course you know.
You can't tell me that you, of all

652
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,193
people, approve of this?

653
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,037
No, I don't. But it's not my decision.
Nor is it yours.

654
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,198
- You know what, Back the fuck off, or
- Or what?

655
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,517
Ok both of you... Calm down and
take five, or eight. Twelve.

656
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,308
Hey man, who the fuck are you?
seriously, I mean, where the fuck did

657
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,396
you come from, anyway?

658
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,395
Carlos!

659
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,235
Please... stop.

660
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,276
Fuck man! !

661
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,789
Can someone tell me what the fuck
just happened here?

662
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,395
Junior here just strapped on a pair of
brass balls is what happened!

663
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,469
- Are you getting the lap band?
- Brent.

664
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,910
- What?
- Leave it.

665
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,432
It's OK. Yes, I am getting the lap
band. I'm going into surgery the

666
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,154
Monday after BearCity.

667
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,231
Michael, that's next weekend.

668
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,349
I know, I know. And thank you for
coming to my defense, but you guys

669
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,109
please don't be too hard on Carlos, I
know this is really tough on him.

670
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,073
And you, thank you for stepping in
between the two people I love most in

671
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,953
the world and keep them from killing
themselves.

672
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,472
Yeah, you got all Judge Judy on her.

673
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,071
I was impressed.

674
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,389
so was I.

675
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,589
I just wanted to make sure I put
in my footlong order.

676
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,997
Hey Rodge!

677
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,037
Teddy Bear! What is up?

678
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,156
How's it going?

679
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,315
What's cooking?

680
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,159
Apparently you are! Nice apron.

681
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,630
Ahh, sexy fuck.

682
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,908
What up man?

683
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,109
Yo man what up?

684
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,957
sup.

685
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,390
Alright, who's hungry? Huh?

686
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,191
Oh yeah, I'll take two of
everything, man.

687
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,196
I'll have what he's having.

688
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,999
I'm sorry, Brent. It just happened.

689
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,910
I know. I saw. You think I'm stupid?

690
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,994
No, I don't. I was stoned.

691
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,709
Oh, what's fucking new?

692
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:42,990
Why didn't you say something?

693
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,160
What am I supposed to say, Fred?
''Tyler, can you please get your taint

694
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,759
out of my husband's face''?

695
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,993
Oh fuck, I can't believe I did that.

696
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,114
I can't believe you did it after we
just talked about how you were OK

697
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,878
with not doing it.

698
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,038
That was the truth, Brent. I wasn't
looking to open the relationship.

699
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,392
Then what are you looking for
in the crack of his ass?

700
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,793
C'mon Brent! You weren't exactly up
for things all the time, you know.

701
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,877
Oh ok, right? so I'm totally impotent
just because I don't want to

702
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,035
have fucking sex all the time.

703
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,800
I'm sorry. I'm just getting a lot of
mixed signals here, Brent. One minute

704
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,753
you're up for trying new things and
then you do a 180.

705
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,188
Fine. I will do it.

706
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,719
see!

707
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,909
see.

708
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,158
Oh.. God.

709
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:49,916
Hey, baby. This is a work-in-progress.
If this doesn't work out we'll talk,

710
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:58,391
and we'll figure something else out
that does work for both of us. OK?

711
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,355
Okay

712
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,435
I love you.

713
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,750
I love you too.

714
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,038
Aww, sweetie.

715
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,157
More, more.

716
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,158
God I love stroller meat.

717
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,435
simon?

718
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,795
The one and only!

719
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,712
Jesus, if I have needed to see anybody
right now you are the perfect person

720
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,353
who has just skated into my heart.

721
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,390
Now I'm necessary in your life?

722
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,350
simon, listen to me.

723
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,151
Not even a single text message.

724
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,918
Ok, I am sorry, simon. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. What else do I have to prove to

725
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,749
you how sorry I am. Besides what
you're thinking in your head.

726
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,269
You are so lucky I still want
to tap that ass.

727
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,831
What are you doing?
What have you been up to?

728
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,433
I just got emancipated from my
slave labe at Urban O's.

729
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,596
When the hell did you
start working there?

730
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,029
Oh well, since you flaked on us Cory
and I found a third. Jasyn. He hooked

731
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,630
me up. It's Jasyn with a ''y.'' He's
friends with Bryan with a ''y.''

732
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,869
Oh yes, because vowels just don't cut
it for the gay generation anymore.

733
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,509
I miss you, Ty.

734
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,032
I miss you too, simon. I'm sorry for
bailing on you guys, really.

735
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:45,236
And I'm sorry that I said that thing
about the thing, and the other thing.

736
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,308
Right, whatever that just meant
it means a lot.

737
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,594
I hear the siren song of starbitches
coffee.

738
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,711
someone looking for a caffeine
infusion?

739
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,558
Coffee, no. I think I'd rather die.

740
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,830
Let's go back to your place
and have a real drink.

741
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,597
Done!

742
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,235
You like that? You like that, huh?
You like that?

743
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,595
Oh! Oh! Oh!

744
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,591
Oh yeah. You like that huh?

745
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,196
Yeah!

746
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,679
shut the fuck up!

747
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,670
Are you OK?

748
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,270
I'm fine, boy. I'm fine. Fine.

749
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,992
so your telling me he stuck his
fingers in your ass? Cheers to that!

750
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,111
Notice anything different?

751
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,153
Um... you're now a part of
the rhythm nation?

752
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,751
Hello - I lost 5 whole pounds! I
thought I'd have you drooling by now.

753
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,631
Actually, gaining ten would probably
put you in the right direction.

754
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,354
What? You mean you want
me to have a roll?

755
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,193
Twenty pounds.

756
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,749
A muffin top?

757
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,231
Thirty.

758
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,238
Are you suggesting a... I mean a...
a whole... a belly?

759
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,677
Yeah, throw some hair on that belly
and I think we're talking perfection.

760
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,159
What happened to you? Were you
dropped on your head as a child?

761
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,553
Oh God, simon, please don't ever
change. You know, scratch that.

762
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,228
Mature, but please don't ever change.

763
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:04,559
Wow, I had no idea. I honestly thought
it was me, why you never, you know.

764
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,955
Oh, simon, there's nothing wrong
with you. Physically.

765
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,956
Ok, listen, I do.. I really do
appreciate you. It's hard, I have

766
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,755
nobody else outside all this anymore
to just, you know, vent to.

767
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,234
Yeah, that's a lot of drama you've got
going on.

768
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,040
Don't bears just cuddle and eat fish
all day?

769
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,389
Please. Bears can be just as gossipy
and superficial as the circuit queens,

770
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,397
ok? Have you heard of musclebears?

771
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,315
No?

772
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,990
Well, those are Roger's buddies,
they're all like the Third Bear Reich.

773
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,875
You not only have to be big and hairy,
you have to be muscular to boot.

774
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,754
Muscular? I always thought you joined
the bear scene

775
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,030
after you lost the battle of the
bulge.

776
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,275
God, I love your sophisticated world
views, it's so FOX News.

777
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,031
sorry, but, c'mon, does a big guy with
a rug on his back really turn you on?

778
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,229
Yes, yes it does.

779
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,713
Wow. You like bears.

780
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,148
I like bears.

781
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,435
OK. And you specifically like this
Roger guy.

782
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,393
This unobtainable Lost Ark of the
Covenant bear.

783
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,393
Yeah, he might be as old as
Indiana Jones.

784
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,509
What?

785
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,071
He's a little bit older, you know.

786
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,429
How old?

787
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,236
Ok. I need you to focus here, simon.
I need to get this guy's attention.

788
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,550
Well, at least you're consistent. You
always used to go after the

789
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,432
unobtainable ones when you hung out
with us too.

790
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,993
That's because I wasn't trying to
obtain them.

791
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,350
This guy I really want to get his
attention.

792
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,630
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

793
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,949
Yup. You need clothes that don't fit.

794
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,438
The ''Bear Book'' oh and
the ''Bear Book'' sequel.

795
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,790
simon, do you really think Roger
is gonna like all this stuff? Ok.

796
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,597
Oh my God, Ty. It's like Bear-neys in
here! Look at all of this great stuff!

797
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,354
Ok, personal shopper easy on it. But
you know, maybe if you're lucky

798
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,959
I'll let you manscape me later.

799
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,119
Thanks.

800
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,230
C'mon, Ty. Do you need help
adjusting anything?

801
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,635
Hang on. Gimme two minutes.

802
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,595
Oh my God, you look so pretty.
He's gonna love it.

803
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,797
Hey, bears! Welcome to Furfest, the
official kick off party of BearCity

804
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,869
weekend. Let's get rowdy, and let the
fur start flyin'!

805
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,749
What's the problem?

806
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,630
We're at capacity. Just gimme
a minute, alright?

807
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,678
I've been here for twenty minutes.

808
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,955
Roger, how you doin' handsome?

809
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,110
Good to see you.

810
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,957
You too. Lookin' good as always.

811
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,275
Right back at ya.

812
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,435
What the fuck!

813
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,593
What can I get you, handsome daddy?

814
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,517
Can I get a Bourbon.

815
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,948
Bourbon? Ok.

816
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,679
Keep the change.

817
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,273
Hey hot cub, what can I get you?

818
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,669
Bourbon on the rocks.

819
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,556
I got it.

820
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,909
I didn't know you were a
bourbon drinker.

821
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,038
Apparently there's a few things you
don't know about me, Rodge.

822
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,711
Apparently.

823
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,069
You look great tonight.

824
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,270
You don't look so bad yourself.

825
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,749
You know,

826
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,233
you almost nailed that spare.

827
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,751
Yeah, I know.

828
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,078
The unmakeable shot.

829
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,549
Is it?

830
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,399
Well look who it is.

831
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:35,836
What can I get you, hot Bear?

832
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,919
Whiskey, rocks.

833
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:49,955
You know you could've brought me in
with you before. I am a hot guy,

834
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,393
you're a hot guy - we would have the
whole city talking.

835
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,874
They're already talking.

836
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,870
Yes. All talk, no action.

837
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,559
Arriba, abajo, al centro,
para adentro.

838
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,478
You're a nasty oso.

839
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,116
You know spanish?

840
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,270
I've spent some time in spain...

841
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,113
And inside a few spaniards.

842
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:37,837
I'm Andalusian.

843
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,353
Is there a difference?

844
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,995
Oh, si.

845
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,433
It all starts with the way you
place your tongue.

846
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,917
I see.

847
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,872
I don't think you do.

848
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,948
- Roger.
- Fernando.

849
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,077
Whooo!

850
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,477
Whoo! Double points.

851
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,357
Triple score!

852
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,437
Oh my God!

853
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,434
shit, Tyler! You scared the
hell out of me!

854
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,676
Haven't you ever heard of knocking?!

855
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,911
Oh God, you're officially whatever the
PC term is for 'retarded'.

856
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,628
Hand me those shorts.

857
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,274
Hey, it's my cardio. Ok? Gym
memberships cost a fortune in this

858
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:30,429
city. What are you doing here, anyway?
shouldn't you be gettin' your Bear on?

859
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,437
I dunno, sy. He's like... he's like
emotionally unavailable. You know, one

860
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,518
minute I feel like we're connecting
and you know, he's going to give me

861
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,553
that Hollywood kiss and the next
minute he's acting like Mr. Tough Guy

862
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,273
in front of his bowling buddies.

863
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,999
Bowling buddies?
Is that like a metaphor?

864
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,351
No, simon, it's like bowling, like
um.. like the sport.

865
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,952
These are the Muscle Bears you
were talking about?

866
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,238
Yep. Today I lost him to some random
albeit hot asshole who

867
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,998
decided to cut in between us.

868
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,233
Well then don't let anyone cut in
between you again.

869
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,838
Did he like the Bear drag?

870
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,109
He loved it. It was perfect. He said I
looked great. His words.

871
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,391
OK, then, that's it. I'm coming with
you tomorrow night and you're going

872
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,750
to tell this guy how you feel once and
for all.

873
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,994
Wow, sy. I've never seen you
so forceful before.

874
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,999
It's kinda hot, right? You want
me now. I know it.

875
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,672
Yes, the ironic headband just
pushed me right over the edge.

876
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,397
Nope, God I like bears.

877
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,669
Where do I buy Rogaine?

878
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,188
so, Fernando? What brings
you to New York.

879
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,116
Holiday, I am here for a week.

880
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,074
so what do you do in..

881
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,076
Barcelona.

882
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,396
Barcelona?

883
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,078
I am a Go-Go Dancer at
the Bear Factory.

884
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,515
Are you joking?

885
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,431
No, have you ever been?

886
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,517
Yeah. Yeah I've been there.

887
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,191
Is there good money in that?

888
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,109
Yeah, I do OK.

889
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,596
How about you?

890
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,115
I think you probably can't pay your
bills as a Go-Go Dancer in New York.

891
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,914
Lord knows I've tried.

892
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,390
No, I'm in finance.

893
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,670
And you don't have a boyfriend?

894
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,513
What about you? You have some French
or German musclebear waiting for you

895
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,110
in a hotel room down in the financial
district?

896
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:37,197
No, no, I am flying solo. It's hard in
spain, no one is interested in a

897
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,154
relationship. They just want to have
sex with tourists. It gets boring

898
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,593
after a while. That's why I'm thinking
about moving here.

899
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,236
That's understandable,
it never gets boring here.

900
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,917
No, to find someone.

901
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,154
I didn't take you as a nester.

902
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:19,033
I'm thinking about it. That's the
reason I am here this week. I was

903
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,198
planning to look at apartments, for
work, a new life.

904
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,230
As a Go-Go dancer?

905
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:32,274
No, I just did that to put myself
through University.

906
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,157
I'm a massage therapist.

907
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,351
Oh really?

908
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:39,711
si.

909
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,796
Are you good?

910
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,349
The best. Do you want a massage?

911
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,831
I want a lot of things, but I'll
start with a massage.

912
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,708
Baum chicka bouw boum. Bauw!

913
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,468
What do you want?

914
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,556
Do the wave!

915
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,159
I knew it.

916
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,710
Nice.

917
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,396
- You put it in?
- Yeah.

918
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,715
You wrote the right name?

919
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,274
- Yes, stop.
- With two X's. X X L?

920
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,635
Yes double X, L.

921
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,436
OK, we got a few more here, so we're
gonna put these messages in your

922
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:02,953
envelopes. so come up when I call your
name. Texas Bear... You've got Mail!

923
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,037
- This is stupid.
- It's not stupid. It's hot.

924
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,753
Wait so, it's hot?
You're lookin' cool.

925
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,915
shut up.

926
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,910
FuzzyCub4Daddy... You've got Mail!
BeerCan Double XL... you've got

927
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,280
mail... that's a shocker.

928
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,076
mail... that's a shocker.

929
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,872
Oh good. Now he's gotta go two flights
up to find us.

930
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,195
Hiding in the corner of the roof.

931
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,152
We're not hiding. Just looking casual,
just lookin' cool.

932
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,793
sent him a note instead
of just talking to him.

933
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,833
Danny, I need a better screen name
than ''Frank Furter.''

934
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,715
sure Frank. Try this one.

935
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,436
''Auntie Biotic?''

936
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,719
Hey, I'm BeerCan Double XL.

937
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,710
Prove it.

938
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,114
I got your proof right here!

939
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,511
- What'd you write?
- Doesn't matter.

940
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,870
- Did you write something cool?
- Yeah, it's totally cool.

941
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,590
Fuck yeah.

942
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,436
He's coming.

943
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,595
Oh there he is.

944
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,996
I'm gonna cross my arms,
does this look cool?

945
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,155
Yeah, it's cool.

946
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,157
Chill.

947
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:20,951
Hey.

948
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,236
Hey.

949
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,194
I got your note.

950
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,678
- That's hot.
- Yeah that's fucking hot.

951
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,118
so, you interested, Bro?

952
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,798
The name's Mel... And you are?

953
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,070
I'm Fred and this is my hot
motherfucking partner Brent.

954
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,439
sometimes our friends call us..

955
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,637
Call us Bert and Ernie.

956
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,629
Fuck. Not if they want to live.
Or get some.

957
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,109
Yeah. That's right.

958
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,916
How about I just call you two the
hottest holes I've ever turned out?

959
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,030
Like inside out?

960
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,790
Possibly.

961
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,716
Fuck.

962
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,591
Come on.

963
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,431
Good.

964
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,434
I'm trying to get clean.

965
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,109
Let me get some of that..

966
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,838
How does my hair look?
My hair look cool?

967
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,632
Wait, wait. Oh it's very cool.

968
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,876
Hey boys.

969
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,317
We don't need that.

970
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,109
No we don't. What's the
minimum at this table?

971
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,789
Ummm... the house welcomes your bet.

972
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,115
Yeah, poker, whatever.

973
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,631
Yeah, fuck yeah.

974
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,237
Easy, easy. Uncle Mel won't forget
about you, handsome.

975
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,350
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

976
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,992
Easy on the nipples, Kid, Uncle
Mel likes it soft.

977
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,598
I'm sorry, sir. I mean, Uncle
Melvin. I've been a bad boy.

978
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,157
That's a good boy. Yeah.
He's a good boy.

979
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:37,272
Hey, man easy with the finger in my
hole. You gotta' go smooth.

980
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,836
I'm sorry, Uncle Mel. I'm sorry.

981
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,120
Uncle Mel will guide ya. Yeah.

982
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,989
What the fuck? Hey, what the
hell you doin' Kid?!

983
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:08,916
I thought you would like that?

984
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,909
You thought I'd like that?!

985
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,994
- Well, he likes it...
- What? You like it?

986
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,030
No I don't like it..

987
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,109
What the fuck is going on
with you amateurs?

988
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,036
I don't like that..

989
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,676
You know guys are fucked. Yeah, I
am getting the fuck out of here.

990
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,476
Uncle Mel!

991
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,871
Oh my God.

992
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,751
Holy shit, Brent!

993
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,633
''Holy shit, Brent?!'' You're not
pinning this on me just because I won.

994
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,594
What'd you win? Asshole of the year
award for your water sports antics?

995
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,358
No, Mr. finger missile, you won that
when you

996
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,879
decided to open this relationship.

997
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,679
You decided to do this! I was over it.

998
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,710
Karma.

999
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,875
I'm an adult.

1000
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,190
Oh my God.

1001
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,550
Oh come on! This is a door,
can we try using it..

1002
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,274
Oh holy shit, I'm calling 91 1!

1003
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,230
Wait, shit.

1004
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,873
Tyler, wait!

1005
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,957
Uncle Mel?

1006
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,511
Is it good?

1007
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,675
Yeah, just like my dick.

1008
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,716
What's up.

1009
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,230
I.D. please? Thank you.

1010
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,439
Woof! Grrr.

1011
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,359
What are you doing?

1012
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,310
Getting my bear on.

1013
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,839
Ok simon, do not embarrass me.

1014
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,110
Ok.

1015
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,596
Thank you.

1016
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,711
Grr.

1017
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,875
Let's go.

1018
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,072
Oh, it's good!

1019
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,110
Really good?

1020
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,070
Yeah, you want one?

1021
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,959
You know what, let's do it. I have
just had a week of job interviews

1022
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:31,956
and made it through.

1023
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,355
Didn't you have a promising interview?

1024
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,713
The interview was not promising,
the job was. Broadway.com.

1025
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,156
What is this Broadway you speak of?

1026
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,156
Who let you in here?

1027
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,077
I am on your side.

1028
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,034
Aww. May we please taste
your Dirty Jock?

1029
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,514
Three Dirty Jocks coming up!

1030
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,039
Oh ok, what exactly is in
a Dirty Jock, Randy?

1031
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,875
I'll be right with you. It's vodka,
club soda, olive juice chilled to

1032
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,911
perfection, topped with an olive.

1033
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,869
Martini in a shot glass.

1034
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:58,717
With some bubbles.

1035
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,750
It's not girlie enough for me.

1036
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,518
What's up!

1037
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,709
Two more.

1038
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,312
Guys, this is my old roommate and
dear dear friend, simon.

1039
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,993
Hello ursine creatures!
I come in peace.

1040
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,710
Oh how sweet. Michael.
simon, nice to meet you.

1041
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,833
simon, this is my new roommate Fred.

1042
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,231
Enchanted.

1043
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,388
And the ever charming Brent.

1044
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,516
Hi.

1045
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,109
Nice to finally meet you both. Oh,
I hope your uncle's OK.

1046
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,198
Ohh, was there a newsletter?
Put a banner up?

1047
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,716
I'm going to kill you.

1048
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,349
C'mon guys, I ain't got all night.

1049
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,710
One for beauty.

1050
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,116
Beast.

1051
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,516
You wanna take this
drink here, Fred?

1052
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,271
I'm gonna be rude guys, and
make a toast to myself.

1053
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,199
To the new me... inside
all this old me!

1054
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,316
Ah yes.

1055
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,316
Cheers.

1056
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,919
Ew!

1057
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,753
What the hell was that?

1058
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,275
Awful.

1059
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,754
That was Randy's Dirty Jock.

1060
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,030
Yeah, tastes like it.

1061
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,111
Fuck you bitches. Die of thirst.

1062
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,073
so, what happened with Broadway.com?

1063
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:14,192
Alright, alright. Listen to this. What
had happened was, as usual I get to

1064
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,872
the interview and I am drenched in
sweat. The guy, the embryo ya know, I

1065
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,871
was interviewing with goes out to his
receptionist right at that moment.

1066
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:28,957
Grr.

1067
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,356
What are you doing? No!

1068
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,510
Boys! Your elder is talking.

1069
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,075
I'm sorry father.

1070
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:45,480
so, I go up to shake his hand, it
slides off a torrent of wet. But

1071
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:51,312
that's not when I lost it. I get in
his office, I put my big chubby buns

1072
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,957
up in a chair. Make sure I don't break
it. Lean back and the button from my

1073
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:02,998
belly drops into the sky, 360 degree
turns swear to this day and lands

1074
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,918
right on his desk.

1075
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,510
You are lying.

1076
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,796
True.

1077
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,316
Oh girl, that is so hot!

1078
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,870
That's horrifying!

1079
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,115
It's hot-rrifying!

1080
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,351
Just trying it out.

1081
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,154
Your comedy done run dry girl.

1082
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,112
No? I'm a giver.

1083
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,313
Any other day I might have gone to the
chicken shack, the taco haven. I'd run

1084
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,876
down and got me some chocolate
ringlets, a couple of Cornish hens.

1085
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,868
But I thought to myself I'm gonna lose
so much weight, I gonna go back, I'm

1086
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,230
gonna get this job. I'm gonna take it.

1087
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,476
That's right.

1088
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,512
Well, what ever ended up happening
with the whole button thing then?

1089
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,271
Well, I made a joke. I said it's
''Occupational hazard for us Bears''. He

1090
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,109
laughed politely, and then he offered
me a sewing kit.

1091
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,829
No.

1092
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:45,677
As one does.

1093
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,676
As one do.

1094
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,513
Lord, I'm so sorry baby.

1095
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,190
Oh it was a moment. But you know
what, I've got friends like y'all, I'm

1096
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,392
gonna lose 227 pounds. I'm gonna
conquer the world.

1097
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,110
That's sweet.

1098
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,878
Yes, it is, just like you.

1099
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,868
Wahoo. Uh hum. see this? see what I'm
doing here? This is what the kids call

1100
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:06,755
the ''E'' kicking in. And I am starting
my roll as they say, so I think I'm

1101
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,111
gonna get on the dance floor and start
dancing!

1102
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,070
schweet!

1103
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,231
Did he just say he had ''E''?

1104
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,111
simon.

1105
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,478
Right. Chao. Come on you guys,
come on let's go dance.

1106
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,275
C'mon. Michael. Let's go dance, baby.

1107
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,436
Oh I'm too old for this shit.

1108
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,473
Get your fat ass up and
get on the dance floor.

1109
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,954
Oh don't call me out like that!

1110
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,234
You are officially tryin' to kill me.

1111
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,198
Awe baby. Come on Papa,
gotta move your hips.

1112
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,630
If I move my hips anymore
they're gonna fall off.

1113
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,275
C'mon Daddy, you can do it!

1114
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,350
Where'd you get this one? That's
a nice Christmas present.

1115
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,237
He likes the buffet.

1116
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,236
What was that? What was that?

1117
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,150
You the monorail.

1118
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,192
Hold for bus.

1119
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,274
Come here Cece Pennington.

1120
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:03,836
Calm down.

1121
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,629
Hey what about the kid?

1122
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,518
Tell him to come on over.

1123
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,030
Yeah wind him in.

1124
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,558
Get if off, come on take it off.

1125
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,318
I guess it wouldn't be a gay club if
I didn't take my shirt off.

1126
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,676
Hey, where the hell is simon?

1127
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,235
I fell in.

1128
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,911
I'm gonna kill this bitch.
Kill this bitch.

1129
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,671
Well, look what we have here!

1130
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,309
Hey, Roger!

1131
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,715
Which one is Roger?

1132
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,788
Guys, this is Fernando
from Barcelona...

1133
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,151
... can we join in?

1134
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,112
Yeah come in, Rodge. Back it up.

1135
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,516
You boy, in front!

1136
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,193
You, close your mouth,
you're drooling.

1137
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,359
He is fucking hot, Rodge.

1138
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:49,756
He's moving in with me.

1139
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,718
Did somebody put ''E'' in my dirty jock?

1140
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,717
Did he just say he's moving
in with him?

1141
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,596
Ty, you OK?

1142
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,197
Yeah, sure.

1143
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,591
- Congratulations.
- Alright, I'll see you later.

1144
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,675
I'm hungry. I want some chicken.

1145
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,672
- Poop hat.
- Poop hat.

1146
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,033
should I even ask what
you're laughing at?

1147
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,350
No.

1148
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,274
That's Uncle Mel?

1149
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,592
You are out of your mind.
Where'd yall get ecstasy?

1150
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,431
Oh, from the Circuit Bear
in the front.

1151
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,669
- Oh, you mean Doug?
- Doug.

1152
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:48,630
- Figures.
- Figures.

1153
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,636
Tyler.

1154
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,836
Water.

1155
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,598
You're welcome, Bobby and Whitney.

1156
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,590
Thanks Ty.

1157
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,635
Hello.

1158
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,271
I needed that, I am so sweaty.

1159
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,790
Where's your new roommate?

1160
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,794
- He went to go peeth.
- Peeth.

1161
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,159
This is a new development.
Would you tell your real friends

1162
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,156
what's going on?

1163
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,632
Certainly, Michael, my love.
What would you like to know?

1164
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,591
Well start at ''we met in the back
room'' and go from there.

1165
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,358
For your information we did not meet
in the back room...

1166
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,676
we met at the bar upstairs last night.

1167
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,429
Balls, tell us the story
about his balls.

1168
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,316
He's like your telenovela counterpart!

1169
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,673
You guys are tripping balls,
aren't you?

1170
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,274
- Balls.
- Balls.

1171
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,836
Ignore. Talk to Daddy.

1172
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,671
Look, I realize this may be
uncharacteristic

1173
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,552
but I'm not going to kiss and tell.

1174
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,190
What?! You always tell every story
about every Tom, Dick and Harry.

1175
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,437
Tom's dick is hairy.

1176
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,793
That was funny, that was funny baby.

1177
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,238
Moving in? You just met the guy.

1178
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,312
Love at first grope.
That's what it's called.

1179
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,999
No, no. Love at first sounds!

1180
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,077
Ooh, put that wire hanger
up your little..

1181
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,953
No one would even miss them
if they were gone.

1182
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,316
I will pay you to take them out.

1183
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,469
I'm going to go find simon.

1184
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,630
Who's simon?

1185
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,749
Tyler's old roommate. He a nice li'l
piece of chicken. But you, tell me

1186
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,313
what's goin' on with you?

1187
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,550
Michael, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1188
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,349
How long we known each other?

1189
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,278
That would be since the Mesozoic age.

1190
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,234
Ah, since Pangaea broke apart. And you
have never acted like this. I think

1191
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,557
you have feelings for someone, but it
ain't this spaniard.

1192
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,117
Michael, please don't
psychoanalyze me.

1193
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:41,598
I am your oldest friend, if I don't
psychoanalyze you, who is gonna do it?

1194
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,518
I just want you to be happy.

1195
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,519
I am happy.

1196
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,518
And now I'm going to go find
my Latin stud.

1197
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,637
Oh yeah.

1198
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:56,877
Put it here.

1199
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:57,831
Is that a tear?

1200
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,670
I'll put it up here.

1201
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,117
Oh baby.

1202
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,117
That's cold.

1203
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,435
That's cold.

1204
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,350
Hey what's goin' on?

1205
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,709
Hey Rodge, who you lookin' for?

1206
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,556
This guy I met last night.

1207
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,716
Oh yeah? Well if you find him, send
him on over to me,

1208
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,638
I'll break him in for ya.

1209
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,395
Have a good night Buck.

1210
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:27,751
Excuse me.

1211
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,712
Rodge, wait.

1212
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,670
Tyler, please.

1213
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:34,996
Hey!

1214
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,909
Did you see what that
asshole just did?

1215
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,357
Yes, please forgive that asshole, ok?
I'm in love with him.

1216
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:42,677
That was Roger?

1217
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,435
Yes, simon, go use another bathroom.

1218
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,596
This some Tyra Banks shit!

1219
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,878
sorry, big guy, Woof! Grr!

1220
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,510
Hey Rodge?

1221
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,470
Please, Rodge.

1222
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:50,990
If I think I'm an asshole, then I
imagine the sentiment is mutual.

1223
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,836
When are you going to stop giving a
shit about what everyone thinks,

1224
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,553
and do what you want?

1225
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,674
Kid, what people think is all I see.

1226
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,350
so why don't you close
your eyes for once.

1227
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,434
Aww.

1228
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,434
Peeping Tom much?

1229
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,430
I'm sorry Ty, but that
was so beautiful.

1230
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,828
Please tell me you know this child.

1231
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,189
No I can't say I do.
Feel free to kill him.

1232
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,229
Nice.

1233
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:30,598
Hi, we haven't been properly
introduced. I'm simon.

1234
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,515
What up kid? I'm Roger.

1235
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,591
Hey, simon?

1236
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,433
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave you two,
there's bound to be some Kylie playing

1237
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,113
in this club somewhere...

1238
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:46,836
Oh! I'm so-

1239
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,678
Woof! Daddy's here.

1240
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,750
Ohhhhhhh.... my God
I can't believe I...

1241
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,870
What did I say?

1242
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,077
Don't worry. Once you get to know him,
he's exactly what you think he is.

1243
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,156
God, you're beautiful.

1244
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:11,716
What do you say?

1245
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,789
You ready to go make an
appearance with me?

1246
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,719
Baby, I was just looking for you.

1247
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,549
Keep looking, I'm back there
somewhere.

1248
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,678
Fuck you. There are plenty of you
back there.

1249
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,038
Who wants to eat my ass?

1250
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,669
Last call.

1251
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,551
Veto.

1252
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,150
What about him?

1253
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,110
Veto.

1254
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,753
- What about him?
- Veto.

1255
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:03,915
- Why?
- He has a cold sore.

1256
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,630
Oh my God.

1257
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:10,836
What's up?

1258
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:12,830
Um.

1259
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,834
Mel.

1260
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,834
How you doin'?

1261
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,471
I'm good.

1262
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,075
Woof.

1263
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,718
so, you guys play?

1264
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,149
Um. No, no. We're monogamous.

1265
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,757
Yeah, yeah sorry dude.

1266
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,589
Monogamous. I'm sorry.

1267
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:36,834
We're from outta town.

1268
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,279
Can't blame me for trying.
Good to meet you.

1269
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,994
Oh God, thanks... I like your hat.

1270
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,436
Oh my God.

1271
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,070
stupid.

1272
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:09,992
You have to take care of
this knee, Gordito.

1273
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,830
How does that feel?

1274
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,953
Much better, now.

1275
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,876
I love you, Michael.

1276
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,235
I love you too, Osito.

1277
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,315
And I want to be with you in
the hospital when you go.

1278
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,596
Really?

1279
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,630
I would be lucky to be by your side.

1280
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,315
Thank you.

1281
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,749
That won't be necessary.

1282
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,636
Why, Gordito?

1283
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:57,830
Please.

1284
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:02,909
Carlos, I'm not gonna
have the surgery.

1285
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,596
Really?

1286
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,630
Really.

1287
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,959
Oh my God. When did you decide this?

1288
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,392
When you put the ice on my knee.

1289
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,629
Come here, Gordito!

1290
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,795
Did you have fun last night?

1291
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,513
Oh I know you did had fun last night.
I saw you in the backroom.

1292
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,230
I wasn't in the backroom.

1293
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,839
- You were in the backroom.
- I was not!

1294
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:01,270
When he put the ice on my knee I knew
it. I was letting the world's narrow

1295
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,519
view of beauty dictate my self worth
and disregarding

1296
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,915
the people who love me just how I am.

1297
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,633
Besides, you know how much
a new wardrobe costs these days?

1298
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,511
Ah, yes.

1299
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,111
You two are so cute. And by cute, I
mean I just.. Oh yeah, I definitely

1300
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,151
just threw up in my
mouth a little bit.

1301
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,988
Be that as it may, you both look very
cute. surreal though it may be.

1302
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,711
Oh Mick, you know
I'm bigger than that.

1303
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,476
My phone, my phone.

1304
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,111
My chubby fingers trying to
work this thing...

1305
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,751
I got the job at Broadway.com!

1306
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,269
Oh my God, baby. That's great.

1307
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,356
Congratulations!

1308
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,312
Don't you dare start singing
fucking showtunes...

1309
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,119
I might sing some showtunes.

1310
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,115
Dude, that's awesome!

1311
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,548
Baby, stop moving,
everything's spinning.

1312
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,590
Oh, sorry.

1313
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,113
Hey bitches.

1314
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,230
Randy!

1315
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:58,950
I thought you weren't working today.

1316
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:02,311
I'm not. These are on me. DIRTY JOCKs
ALL THE WAY AROUND!

1317
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,835
Listen up, everyone's attention. Let's
give a big shout out to the peeps that

1318
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,430

1319
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,518

sUCCEssFUL BEARCITY!

1320
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,310
Cheers!

1321
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,557
Drink it up, queers.

1322
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,116
Have fun boys. I'm outta here.

1323
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,350
Hey Roger.

1324
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,357
What up Ted?

1325
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,792
What's going on?

1326
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,359
You remember Tyler?

1327
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,788
Yeah, I lost ten bucks on the kid.
What, you baby-sitting?

1328
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,828
Tyler and I are together so just
watch the fucking attitude.

1329
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:44,354
Ok, Ok. sorry man.
I didn't mean anything.

1330
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:50,958
Tyler, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean any disrespect.

1331
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,229
You got a great man here.

1332
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,075
Yeah I know, Teddy Bear.

1333
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,471
Hey guys, here you go.
Hope you all can make it.
