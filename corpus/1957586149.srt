RADIO HOST: Good evening, friends,

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,941
and welcome to the Good Time Gospel Hour.

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:12,379
I have a vision, a beautiful vision.

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,115
A vision that's larger than life.

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,318
And I need to ask you to reach deep

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,821
and I mean all the way down to the bottom of your pockets

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,424
and send in all of your cash.

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:28,395
Remember, if it doesn't hurt, it's not charity.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,631
That's the Good Time Gospel Hour.

Father Daddy Baba, P.O. Box 461339,

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,240
Hollywood, California 90046.

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,880
Oh, shit!

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,691
I said, no!

14
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,229
Why not?

15
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,331
Because I'm not ready.

16
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,868
Not ready?

17
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,369
That's right.

18
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,139
Oh, great! Thanks a lot.

19
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,474
My bra too?

20
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,776
What? All I did was unsnap it.

21
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,478
The snaps in the back, bozo.

22
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,413
You ripped it.

23
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,450
Christy, how long do we have to wait?

24
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,953
We've been going together since the beginning of time.

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,288
This is our third date.

26
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,757
The longest three dates of my life.

27
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,231
Jer, I've gotten into more trouble because of you

28
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,299
than with anybody else I've ever known.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,868
Like when?

30
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,870
Like when?

31
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,739
Like when you put firecrackers in the tampon dispenser in

32
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,542
the girls room and I was suspended for three days.

33
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,546
And when you charged $180

34
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,682
of 976-PARTY to my father's credit card.

35
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,184
Hey, I'm planning to pay that back.

36
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,055
My parents think I've lost it.

37
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,024
One more thing and I'm grounded for life.

38
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,692
They're strict.

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,228
What time is it?

40
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,165
Relax, it's only 9:30.

41
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,302
I had to promise I'd be back by 10:00 just so they'd let...

42
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:54,941
Wait a minute, what time was it last time I asked you?

43
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,577
You know, 9:30 sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?

44
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,381
And what time was it the time before that?

45
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,349
Uh-oh...

46
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,657
Hey, it's not my fault, it stopped!

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,892
Just shut up and step on it.

00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,169
Hi.

50
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,671
Do you know what time it is?

51
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,607
Uh, 9:30?

52
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,010
It's 12:44.

53
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,712
Care to clue us in where you've been

54
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,614
for the past six hours?

55
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,415
We were worried sick.

56
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,883
Shut up, Margaret!

57
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,085
I can explain.

58
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,686
See, Jerry's watch stopped.

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,055
So, the Kaminski kid.

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,290
I might have known!

61
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,258
We didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,294
Oh? Nothing you'd have to make an

63
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,329
extra trip to confession for?

64
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,631
No!

65
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,566
You better not be lying!

66
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,268
We didn't I swear!

67
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,205
Holy handfuls!

68
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,153
That's it, young lady!

69
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,821

102

and I figure it's time to make my move.

184
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,017
She'll be staying on your floor.

185
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,320
Oh, how super! It's so nice to meet you Christy.

186
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,122
Same here.

187
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,623
Well, why don't you get her settled in

188
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,158
and I'll bring her luggage up.

189
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,794
Right away, Sister. It'll be my pleasure!

190

00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,267
VOICE ON PA: Attention virgins, there will

192
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,271
be no lambada dancing permitted in the dormitory.

193
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,842
That dance is forbidden. I repeat,

194
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,911
that dance is forbidden.

195
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,249
So you're the new inmate?

196
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,717
Huh?

197
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,552
What are you in for?

198
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,555
Dope?

199
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,591
Sex?

200
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,292
No, actually, it's all a misunderstanding

201
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,627
by my parents.

202
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,297
Right.

203
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,601
Listen, I'll give it to you straight.

204
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,037
The rule around here is you play by my rules

205
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,938
and I don't sic the nuns on you.

206
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,308
You stick with that and we'll get along just fine.

207
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,249
Ah!

208
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,751
Jesus Christ, McBride.

209
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,919
Who are you?

210
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,587
Christy Murphy.

211
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,322
She's your new roommate.

212
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,425
Theresa McBride, Melanie Baines.

213
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,326
Oh, hi. Hi.

214
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,195
Hi. Hi, nice to meet you.

215
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,098
I'll leave you lovebirds to get acquainted.

216
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,302
Oh, and make sure you tell her about the

217
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,438
Poor Pagan Children's Fund.

218
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,312
So what is the Poor Pagan Children's Fund?

219
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,347
It's this pool that we have to contribute $5.00

220
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,049
to every week.

221
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,018

00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,319
if you get my meaning.

God damn, what a bitch!

224
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,056
KATHLEEN: I heard that!

225
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,429
So, do you guys ever have any fun around here?

226
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,931
Oh sure we have lots of fun.

227
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,666
Is there ever any boys around?

228
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,402
Oh no. Boys are not allowed on campus,

229
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,237
at least until the big formal.

230
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:20,706
Wonderful.

231
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,978
You would be well advised to nip that attitude problem

232
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,880
right in the bud and get

233
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,350
on with the program. Because if you don't...

234
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,590
Oh, Sister Romona, let me help you.

235
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,326
Oh that's all right I've got it.

236
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,428
How are we getting along here?

237
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,562
ALL: Great!

238
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,531
Hi, Derek. Hi, girls.

239
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,602
Christy, this is Derek, the campus security guard.

240
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,904
He's our hero.

241
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,572
Right, Derek?

242
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,842
Right.

243
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,545
Come on, Derek, I better go get that trunk.

244
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,415
You can hold the door for me.

245
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,817
Bye, girls.

246
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,557
You remember what I said.

247
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,565
Oh, Dick?

248
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,034
Hmm?

249
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,068
You know I've been thinking.

250
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,172
Yeah?

251
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,707
Maybe it won't be so bad having Christy

252
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,376
out of the house now.

253
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,710
How so?

Hey, do you guys mind hurrying up?

258
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,484
Easy, Theo, I'm gonna need a good 15 to 20 minutes

259
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,286
just to coil it out.

260
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,089
Just a pinch between the cheek and gum.

261
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,324
Ahh!

262
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,460
You know many parts are edible.

263
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,162
You guys are disgusting.

264
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,231
Hey, I'm just getting to the good part.

265
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,233
Oh, that's it, I'm gonna puke.

266
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,640
You know, guys, I've been thinking.

267
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,578
If clowns like Stallone and Norris can

268
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,146
lambada in and out of Nam

269
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,182
like a couple of cats climbing a tree,

270
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,217
should be a piece of cake for a threesome of smooth

operators such as ourselves

272
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,488
to crack the parochial padlock on Virgin High.

273
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,824

278
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,670

Get back here!

282
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,951
So, it was at the Council of Trent they made the

283
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,454
all-important decree of what? Who? Anybody.

284
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,925
SISTER: Melanie. Justification.

285
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,727
Very good. The Decree of Justification,

286
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,965
which condemned that nasty thing called what?

287
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,935
Yes, Melanie? Pelagianism.

288
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,203
Pelagianism. Very good.

289
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,840
I'm glad someone is thinking.

290
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:46,145
Now, all of this would not have been necessary, of course,

291
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,981
had it not been for that sneaky little twerp,

292
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:53,786
Mr. Martin Luther, who is guilty of having started the what?

293
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,622
Kathleen.

294
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,693
The civil rights movement?

295
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,628
Oh, good heavens, no.

296
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,962
Christy?

297
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,164
The Protestant Revolt.

298
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,299
SISTER: Yes, the Protestant Revolt

299
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,235
and don't ever say the Reformation.

300
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,107
Well now, girls, the um...

301
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,009
Bishop has decreed

302
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:22,014
that from now on our school must teach sex education.

303
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,083
So, everyone pay attention.

304
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,021
The sperm fertilizes the egg, the egg becomes a zygote,

305
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,658
the zygote becomes an embryo, the embryo becomes a fetus,

306
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,560
the fetus grows, you get fat and have a baby.

307
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,428
Are there any questions?

308
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,832
For tomorrow, chapter 23 in the religion text.

Ah! I'm so sorry, Christy.

312
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,278
What a big klutz I am! Let me help you.

313
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,981
You owe $25 to the Poor Pagan Children's Fund

314
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,884
and you better pay up by Friday, or else.

315
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,853
Here you go, hon.

Mr. Casey is ill.

318
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:19,671
So I'll be filling in for him today here at Roosevelt.

My name is Ms. Bush

320
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,281
and today's science subject...

321
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,191
Is sex education.

322
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,927
Okay.

323
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,496
Sex.

324
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:51,970
What is it and what can it do for you?

325
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,008
Well, at the end of class

326
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,510
we'll have a little demonstration.

327
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,414
But first let's discuss the basics.

328
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,458
The sex organs,

329
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,965
one hundred and one ways in which they are aroused.

330
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,715
Hey, Zoomer, do you gotta do that here?

331
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,650
Hey, I got plaque, do you mind?

332
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,985
Yeah, I do mind.

333
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,187
Well, I have a newsflash, fuck you!

334
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,290
Would you guys chill out?

335
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,598
Man, I hate this! Every day we come up here after school

336
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,333
and we stand around with our thumbs up our asses.

337
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,235
Whose fault is that?

338
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,670
My point is we don't ever do anything.

339
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,806
I mean there's a whole world full of action out there and

340
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,641
we're sitting around here picking our teeth

341
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,742
with a coat hanger.

342
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,911

00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,413
You said it, Zoomer.

345
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,048
Well, let's get out of here. What do you say?

353
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,269

weenie roasted lately.

357
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,643
Yeah, but in my case, it's because they sent my

00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,778

Yeah, damn it.

362
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,249
But it's not our fault is it?

363
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,386
Maybe you guys just aren't cool enough.

Oh, no, Jerry, we are definitely cool enough.

365
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,927
We are the polar ice caps of coolness.

366
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,830
We just have the law of supply and demand working against us.

367
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,399
You know maybe you guys are right.

368
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,002
I mean, even I can't get a new babe and I invented coolness.

369
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,538
So, what are you going to do about it, frosty?

370
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,807
I've got a plan. All right.

371
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,742
You guys stick with me and we'll get the law of

372
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,245
supply and demand to work for us for a change.

373
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,854
Foul! No way!

374
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,257
You fouled me, Murphy, everyone saw!

375
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,692
You charged.

376
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,294
I say foul. Foul stands.

377
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,363
My free throw.

378
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,901
Woo-hoo-hoo!

379
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,459
Behold the denizens of the Academy of the Blessed Virgin.

380
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,760
Virgin High?

381
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,262
Ow! (PANTS)

382
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,464
Easy, Zoom, don't make me get the fire hose.

383
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,366
Oh, come on. Get real here, Jerry.

384
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,967
These are Catholic girls we're talking about.

385
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,170
So? So you know how it is with Catholic girls.

386
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,740
You can looky, but you no touchy.

387
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,108
Oh, ye of little faith.

388
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,378
Let's get in there and slurp up a little poontang.

389
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,679
What?

390
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,514
Come on, what are we waiting for? Let's go get 'em!

391
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,449
Zoomer, in case you haven't noticed,

392
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,952
this is a private Catholic girls' school,

393
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,987
surrounded by an eight foot fence

394
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,122
and guarded by nuns who

395
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,292
probably carry guns, chains and hand grenades.

396
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,594
Theo, you have to understand that nuns are merely

397
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,828
a state of mind.

398
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,097
With the right attitude and a skillful plan,

399
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,533
there's no reason why a group of smart studly gauchos

400
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,069
like us can't have the run of the candy store.

401
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,871
And you've got such a plan I presume.

402
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,540
It's a two prong plan, listen closely.

403
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,841
Prong number one,

404
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,977
Zoomer, put your tongue back in your mouth.

405
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,712
You look like a basset hound.

406
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,913
Prong number two,

407
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,948
you guys go back and wait in the car,

408
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,017
I'll go inside and scope things out.

409
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,886
As soon as I have the situation in hand,

410
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,354
I wave you guys in.

411
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,891
You come on down, being real cool, like you belong here.

412
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,226
You're just going to walk in the gate?

413
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,362
You got it. It's too simple.

414
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,564
The brilliant plans always are.

415
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,366
Gentlemen...

416
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,711
Can I help you? No.

417
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,381
Can you tell me what business you have here?

418
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,816
I'd like to, but I can't.

419
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,752
Well, then I'm afraid I can't let you in.

420
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,887
If you must know,

421
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,356
I'm an official emissary from the Vatican.

422
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,592
They sent me over here to sort of check-up on

423
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,327
some of the girls, give them a couple of interviews,

424
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,963
check up on the morals of today's youth.

425
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,166
It's an order that comes directly from you know who.

426
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,235
Uh-huh.

427
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,370
Sounds like a crock to me.

428
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,506
Oh it does, does it? Yup.

429
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,041
Well, does the word excommunication

430
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,943
mean anything to you?

431
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,444
Nope.

432
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,480
It doesn't?

433
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,149
I'm not a Catholic.

434
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,718
Then I can let you off the hook!

435
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,554
Nice try, Sherlock.

436
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,590
Now, why don't you get out of here

437
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,859
and don't come back.

438
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,727
Got it.

439
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,562
I'll see ya.

440
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,837
Well, Einstein?

441
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,639
We're going to need a new plan.

442
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,490
Do you guys ever get horny?

443
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,092
Christy!

444
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,095
You two are terrible!

445
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,830
I never have those kind of thoughts.

446
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,167
Oh, come off it, Theresa.

447
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,601
I don't!

448
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,204
Unlike the two of you, I intend to bypass purgatory

449
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,072
altogether and go straight to heaven.

450
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,941
BOTH: Right.

451
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,378
And you mean to say, if Derek walked in here right now,

452
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,146
stone-cold naked,

453
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,416
and he said,

454
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,920
Theresa, I'm madly in love with you...

455
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:21,226
I crave your firm young body.

456
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,394
Will you two cut it out?

457
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,764
I want to rip the clothes from your creamy white flesh

458
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,234
and caress your soft supple breasts.

459
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,836
No, please, no!

460
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,673
We'll drown together in a sea of unbridled passion.

461
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:40,378
We'll have simultaneous, multiple orgasms.

462
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,517
Oh, no! Ahh!

463
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,920
(GRUNTING)

464
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,388
(GROWLING)

465
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,328
(MOANING)

466
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,272
Ohh!

467
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,354
(DEREK LAUGHING)

468
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,091
Whew.

469
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,765
Let's do it again!

470
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,534
Oh, I'd love to but I've got homework to do.

471
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,836
Oh, come on.

472
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,839
Now, who was it that got you a key to the Coke machine?

473
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,407
It was me, wasn't it?

474
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,942
Derek, Derek, Derek.

475
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,977
Surely you've heard of the concept of

476
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,113
reasonable value for services rendered.

477
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,814
Now, come on. It's time to scoot!

478
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,249
No, no!

479
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,653
I'm a little bit tired of this arrangement.

480
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,554
I mean I stuck my neck out for you.

481
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,189
I smuggled beer in here,

482
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,759
I got you those answers to that test

483
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,561
and all I seem to get for my troubles

484
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,430
is one little quickie.

485
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,967
Derek, did you ever think that maybe

486
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,636
I'm saving something special for you?

487
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,040
Yeah, what?

488
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,810
I can't tell you exactly,

489
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,581
but it does involve a bicycle chain,

490
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,884
a cucumber,

491
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,320
and six cans of happy whip.

492
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,990
Yeah?

493
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,894
Now, about Sister Gregorio's attendance sheet.

494
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,277
Okay, I've got it! We go up front of Virgin High, see.

495
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,579
We're tossing the football back and forth.

496
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,115
Then I send you out for a long pass.

497
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,550
Now, here's the catch.

498
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,452
I overthrow the ball.

499
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,687
Get it? I overthrow the ball,

500
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,189
it goes over the gate.

501
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,658
They let us through to get the ball, and we're in.

502
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,859
Simple as that.

503
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,695
Right, Zoomer. I'm sure that the security guard is just

504
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,264
going to ask us to stay for dinner because we threw our

505
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,133
football through a stained-glass window.

506
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,102
Oh, yeah, what's your brilliant idea

507
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,503
Mr. Potato-Chip-Up-the-Butt?

508
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,806
How about moving on?

509
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,108
Finding some girls with

510
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,310
intelligence and insight,

511
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,279
with depth and wisdom.

512
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,715
A girl who has something to say.

513
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,021
Theo, be serious.

514
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,123
Anyways, I've got an idea.

515
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,170
Kaminski, this is definitely the dumbest

516
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,406
thing you've done yet.

517
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,041
Do you want to meet those girls or what?

518
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,276
Bring them back alive, J-Man!

519
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,769
Hello, Father.

520
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,173
Hello, Father.

521
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,041
Hi, Papa.

522
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,634
SISTER FELICIA: Father! Ahh!

523
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,903
Oh, I'm sorry, did I startle you?

524
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,638
No, actually I just, uh, inspected

525
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,006
the water fountain over here.

526
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,441
Boy, cold.

527
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,511
I'm Sister Felicia, the principal.

528
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,313
I'm Father Guus.

529
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,849
Father Goose?

530
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,351
Guus, it's Dutch.

531
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,288
Well, you must have just been ordained.

532
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,090
Accelerated.

533
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,859
We haven't seen you here before.

534
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,294
Is there something we can do for you?

535
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,363
Actually, the Bishop did send me over here to

536
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,599
sort of check up on things.

537
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,167
Which bishop?

538
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,535
Bishop, uh...

539
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,670
(COUGHS)

540
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,738
Who?

541
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,173
Bishop... (GAGS)

542
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,674
Bishop Haughness?

543
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,909
That's right, him.

544
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,712
I can't imagine why he would...

545
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,215
Oh, yes of course, Bishop Haughness.

546
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,818
Well Father, we are delighted to have you with us.

547
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,821
My pleasure. Oh, please, do make yourself at home.

548
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,457
In fact, why don't I show you to the rectory

549
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,559
and you can meet some of the other priests.

550
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,227
Well I really wouldn't want...

551
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,296
Sister Felicia!

552
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,797
Oh, excuse me Father.

553
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:00,899
Yes, Sister, what is it?

554
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,167
Felicia we have a problem.

555
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,336
Sister Molano Voloce has taken a vow of silence and

556
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,273
we have nobody to take her theology class.

557
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,374
Can't you take it?

558
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,909
I have my history class.

559
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,911
Oh dear, I would do it myself,

560
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,648
but I have an important meeting in ten minutes.

561
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,250
Perhaps the Father can help us out?

562
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,818
Sister, what an excellent idea.

563
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,953
Oh, would you Father?

564
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,288
It's so important that we do not let their education

565
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,355
be interrupted.

566
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,491
And who would be better qualified?

567
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,527
Yes, yes, it's the first room on the left.

568
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,796
Oh, thank you so much, Father.

569
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,166
SISTER FELICIA: You are a saint.

570
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,038
So, Sister, the rumors are true.

571
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,339
Which rumors?

572
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,607
The ones about the Bishop wanting to

573
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,309
close down our school.

574
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,978
No. He has sent that young priest to check us out

575
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,047
and make a report. No!

576
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,316
Well, good thinking to get him into that classroom.

577
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,618
That will give us some time to alert everyone.

578
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,688
Right. Now we must immediately get on the telephone and tell...

579
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,406
Good morning, class. ALL: Good morning, Father.

580
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,941
Right.

581
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,311
Sister Molano Voloce has taken a vow of silence this morning,

582
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,513
so I'll be filling in for her today.

583
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,948
My name is Father Guus.

584
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,157
That's Guus, not Goose.

585
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,526
It's Dutch.

586
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,895
And this is what class? Anybody?

587
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,000
Uhh, theology.

588
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,169
Good thinking.

589
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,106
Which brings the question, what is theology?

590
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,012
VOICE IN HEAD: What is theology?

591
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,487
Who can tell me what this is?

592
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,657
A squiggle?

593
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,360
I didn't call on you yet.

594
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,499
Anybody?

595
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,268
Anybody?

596
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,342
A squiggle. Exactly.

597
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,178
But who can tell me the theological ramifications

598
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,746
of the squiggle?

599
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,549
Come on anybody. Let's net be bashful.

600
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,087
How about you?

601
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,826
He could come over there at any time,

602
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,663
so I would like to have everything in tip-top shape.

603
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,999
All right, Sisters. Good-bye.

604
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,600
(PHONE RINGING)

605
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,270
Sister Felicia.

606
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,240
Oh, hello, Mr. Murphy!

607
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,575
Hello, Sister.

608
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,876
I just wanted to check with you to see

609
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,212
how our daughter Christy is doing?

610
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:05,817
Well I am happy to report she is doing just fine.

611
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,786
Her grades are good and she hasn't had

612
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,055
a single discipline problem.

613
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,825
Excellent! Then it seems that sending her to your

614
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,860
school was the right thing to do.

615
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,629
Well, it would seem so.

616
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,198
Well, thank you very much, Sister.

617
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,033
Oh, and one other thing.

618
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,935
You may be aware that I am on the board

619
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,170
of the Gelt Gouger Foundation.

620
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,473
I also know about the financial difficulties

621
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,209
your school has been having.

622
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,046
Yes, it's unfortunate, but true, sir.

623
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,348
Well, if you can keep up the good work,

624
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,017
I'll see to it that the Academy of the Blessed Virgin

625
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,453
receives a hefty little endowment.

626
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,255
How does that sound?

627
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:49,360
Oh! I think the Lord would approve of that, Mr. Murphy.

628
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,295
(SIGH)

629
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:55,366
RADIO HOST: Daddy Baba's Gomashio is the spice of life

630
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,435
order yours today by sending

631
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:02,640
$9.95 to Howard at P.O. Box...

632
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:06,177
So, if you make a philological digression,

633
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,447
you'll see that the tenants of Zoroastrianism

634
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,784
merely reconfirm the truism that we are after all

635
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,720
merely adjuncts to the divinely ordained.

636
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,922
Which brings us to the final answer.

637
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,290
The final answer!

638
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,761
Which is of course,

639
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,800
sex.

640
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,005
Class dismissed.

641
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,541
Wait!

642
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,075
Okay, go.

643
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,978
Stop!

644
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,414
Okay, the rest of you go.

645
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,416
You, young lady, you stay after class.

646
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,558
Hey, babe.

647
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,692
Jerry, get a life.

648
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,027
Shh!

649
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,395
What are you doing here?

650
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,464
Roosevelt has the day off.

651
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,100
That wasn't my question.

652
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,535
I miss you. I had to come see you.

653
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,104
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be in this place.

654
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,140
You're not going to blame me for that are you?

655
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,541
Yes, I am.

656
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,811
Look, I'll admit,

657
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,813
you've had a little bit of bad luck with me,

658
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,483
but I'm turning over a new leaf, honest.

659
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,851
Right.

660
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,453
From now on I'm straight as an altar boy.

661
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,857
And is this what the altar boys are wearing now?

662
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,391
Look, it was the only way I could get in to see you.

663
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,826
All right?

664
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,029
This is absolutely the last gimmick I swear.

665
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,499
I know you've missed me.

666
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,601
And hey, I've got some friends for your friends.

667
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,369
Father! I thought you might...

668
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,804
What's going on?

669
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,874
Uh, I was just disciplining this young lady.

670
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,709
Oh, what did she do?

671
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:46,544
She was...

672
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,448
Making rude bodily noises.

673
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,582
Christy!

674
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,717
I was not!

675
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,852
SISTER FELICIA: Well I should hope not!

676
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,723
Father, I thought you might like a little

677
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,892
guided tour around the school.

678
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,527
Oh, that would be lovely,

679
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,562
but could you just wait for me outside?

680
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,531
Well, of course, Father.

681
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,136
Duh, Jer.

682
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:13,371
Why'd you say that?

683
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,839
It just popped into my head.

684
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,908
I ought to pop you in the head!

685
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,410
I couldn't think of what to say.

686
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,913
I stay out of trouble for five weeks!

687
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,581
I talk to you for two minutes

688
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,483
and I'm back on a shitlist again.

689
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,051
Why don't you just stay out of my life?

690
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,888
Christy!

691
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,090
How dare you hit a priest!

692
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,426
It's okay, Sister, she was just...

693
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,262
What were you just?

694
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,132
It most certainly is not okay!

695
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,535
Young lady, I am very, very disappointed with you.

696
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,272
You think you're sorry now, you bet you'll be sorry!

697
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,509
From now on, except for class and Church

698
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,011
you will not leave your dorm until further notice.

699
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,147
Do I make myself clear?

700
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,415
Yes, Sister.

701
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,783
Now scoot.

702
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,790
Boy today's youth, huh?

703
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,892
I can't understand it, Father.

704
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,261
She's been such a good girl.

705
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,364
Must be that time of the month.

706
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:19,637
Well, anyway, I thought this might be a good time

707
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,073
for you to hear confessions.

708
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,475
Confessions?

709
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,861
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

710
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,330
My last confession was a week ago.

711
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,799
My sins are...

712
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,403
I coveted my neighbor's dessert in lunch hall,

713
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,673
I almost said a bad word when I stubbed my toe.

714
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,476
Oh, and I had an impure thought.

715
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,646
Oh, really? What kind of impure thought?

716
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,681
I...

717
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,618
I imagined I was kissing Donny Osmond.

718
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,654
That's it?

719
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,255
Yes, Father.

720
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,057
Don't let it happen again.

721
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,226
Yes, Father.

722
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,330
Are you going to give me a penance?

723
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,567
What do you think you deserve?

724
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,505
I don't know.

725
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,774
Ten Hail Mary's and The Lord's Prayer?

726
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,410
I can deal with that, but

727
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,412
go ahead and tack on 20 push-ups.

728
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,893
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

729
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,662
It's been a week since my last confession.

730
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,130
Let's see...

731
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,900
I slugged a girl, but she asked for it.

732
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,670
And I cheated on a test.

733
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,506
But that's only if you call it cheating when the girl next

734
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,775
to you practically begs you to look at her answer sheet

735
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,944
by not covering it up.

736
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,114
And I told a few fibs here and there,

737
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,683
but I'm sure it didn't hurt anybody.

738
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,086
Any impure thoughts?

739
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,723
Well, sure, yeah some of those.

740
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,558
Tell me about them.

741
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,259
Well...

742
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,330
In math class I imagined I was sunbathing

743
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,666
on a deserted island

744
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,301
in my bikini...

745
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,136
Yes.

746
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,538
And it just got so hot

747
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,674
I had to take off my top.

748
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,443
Really?

749
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:43,414
And my nipples, they stood firm and erect

750
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,750
as the foamy waves washed over my body.

751
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,252
Yes?

752
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,424
And I felt this, this tingling sensation

753
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,659
on my taut supple thighs.

754
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,029
And I suddenly realized

755
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,767
I was madly, madly aroused.

756
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,905
Is this a sin?

757
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,306
I hope so.

758
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,408
What?

759
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,742
God only knows.

760
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,712
Continue.

761
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,580
You know, I thought I'd go with it.

762
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:20,217
I grabbed the soil and I just rubbed it everywhere,

763
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,119
just everywhere, all over my body.

764
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,289
Because it was so hot, oh, Father, Father it was hot!

765
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,493
(GASPING)

766
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,861
It was hot.

767
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,430
Ooh...

768
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,731
Mmm...

769
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,701
(FALLS ONTO FLOOR)

770
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,207
They caught him.

771
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,446
They tied him up with rosary beads

772
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,614
and dumped him in a vat of boiling holy water.

773
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,184
Would you relax, Theo, he'll be fine.

774
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,896
How did you like our chapel, Father?

775
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,832
Very, very, very much.

776
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,466
Good, good.

777
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,737
You know you certainly did take a lot of time

778
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,039
with that one girl.

779
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,674
Well I like to be very thorough.

780
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,243
I think of confession as a sort of...

781
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,812
A spiritual enema.

782
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,383
Oh.

783
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,996
Sister Felicia, I meant to speak with you

784
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,998
about that Christy...

785
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,066
Murphy.

786
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,168
Oh, yes, Father, what a shame.

787
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,070
I don't know how to explain it.

788
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,239
Actually, I think it all might have been just a little

789
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,874
bit of a misunderstanding.

790
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,877
See she said she wanted to make a confession with me.

791
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,714
And I said, Do you want to make it with me right now?

792
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,683
I think she misinterpreted.

793
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,088
Well, well she still shouldn't have hit you, Father.

794
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,522
Maybe we could just make her punishment

795
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,757
a little less severe.

796
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,894
Well, we'll see.

797
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,464
(PHONE RINGING) Oh, I better get that. Excuse me, Father.

798
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,436
Hello, Father!

799
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,016
Sister Felicia.

800
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,518
Sister Felicia, this is Bishop Haughness.

801
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,754
Oh, hello, Bishop Haughness!

802
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,657
Hello Sister. How are things at the Academy?

803
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,693
Oh, just fine your Excellency, couldn't be better.

804
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,528
Oh, and I want you know,

805
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,231
Father Guus has been having a wonderful visit.

806
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,736
BISHOP HAUGHNESS: Father Guus?

807
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,506
After lunch were going to show him the petunia beds.

808
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,475
Sister, have you been feeling all right?

809
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:01,245
Well, yes, of course. Why do you ask?

810
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,515
Never mind. Sister, I'm afraid we have some

811
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,317
serious business to discuss.

812
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,821
Yes, I know, we've heard the rumors, sir.

813
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,992
The school has become a drain on the Church's resources.

814
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,260
If it can't be turned around...

815
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,163
Actually, the good news is that our troubles

816
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,864
may be over soon.

817
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,801
I think we'll be getting an endowment from

818
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,070
the Gelt Gouger Foundation!

819
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,239
Oh, really?

820
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,277
Yes, and if you could bear with us until the

821
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,247
end of the semester, I think things will work out.

822
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,684
Well, I suppose we could hold off that long.

823
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,320
Oh, thank you, your Excellency!

824
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,456
You won't regret it!

825
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,859
And I know you'll be happy with Father Guus's report.

826
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,895
Who is this Father Guus business?

827
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,299
Well, you know, the priest you sent to look us over.

828
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,701
I didn't send any Father Guus.

829
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,972
You didn't?

830
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,008
Well, all right your Excellency.

831
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,976
Thank you for calling.

832
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,344
Goodbye.

833
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,281
Guus?

834
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,624
(VOICE IN HEAD) Hmm... Murphy, Christy. 217.

835
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,732
Where, where is he?

836
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,934
Wait till I get my hands on him.

837
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:35,205
Father Guus indeed. I'll Father Guus him.

838
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,776
My goodness if I ever see him.

839
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,377
I'll goose his goose.

840
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,283
SISTER FELICIA: Sisters and virgins be on the lookout for

841
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,153
an imposter priest who has infiltrated the Academy

842
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,355
under the guise of Father Guus.

843
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,058
He should be considered armed and dangerous.

844
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,696
Oh my God, he escaped! Well, how'd you do?

845
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,098
All right!

846
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,366
Put on your party hats boys

847
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,002
we're coming back here tomorrow night.

848
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,518
Four, five, six, free parking!

849
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,387
Ahh! You bitch!

850
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,938
(WOLF HOWLING)

851
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,013
If my calculations are correct and I do believe they are,

852
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,050
Christy's dorm room is 200 yards due southwest.

853
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,351
Which is right over that wall.

854
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,519
Hot damn!

855
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,654
No way, Kaminski. There is no way I'm going to

856
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,457
be a party to this.

857
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,525
Shit!

858
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,196
Community chest, $200.

859
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,638
I really appreciate you guys staying in with me

860
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,772
tonight while I'm grounded.

861
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,008
No problem, it's the least we could do.

862
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,811
Yeah, and besides, it's not like we have 40 guys

863
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,246
calling us for dates tonight.

864
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,647
Yeah.

865
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,915
You know what would really be neat?

866
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,150
What?

867
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,519
If three Greek gods came flying through that window

868
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,588
right this minute and swept us up in their powerful

869
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,291
arms and carried us off to Mt. Olympus.

870
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,361
Yeah, three Greek gods.

VOICE ON PA: Attention virgins.

872
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,766
Do not miss the movie tonight,

873
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,370
The Bells of St. Mary, starring Bing Crosby.

874
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,111
Okay Murphy, it's Friday night, time to pay the piper.

875
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,047
Come on Kathleen, give her a break.

876
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,517
When I want to hear from you, Bings, I'll send a fax.

877
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,286
Twenty-five bucks!

878
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,424
Well, I don't think you understand what the

879
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,127
Poor Pagan Children's Fund is!

880
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,796
It is not an optional thing!

881
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,200
Everybody contributes to the Poor Pagan Children's Fund.

882
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,670
What's the Poor Pagan Children's Fund?

883
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,471
GIRLS: Good evening, Sister.

884
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:27,678
Um, the Poor Pagan Children's Fund... It...

885
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:28,979
I may as well tell you.

886
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,081
See we've all been contributing to this fund

887
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,950
and at the end of the semester we were going

888
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,151
to give it all to you.

889
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,553
It was supposed to be a surprise, but, well

890
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,255
I guess you found us out.

891
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,091
I'll be darned. Whose idea was this?

892
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,628
Well I can't take all the credit.

893
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,630
I couldn't have done it without the girls.

894
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,733
And Kathleen's been keeping the money. She has over $300.

895
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,201
No kidding!

896
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,404
Well I must say, I didn't think you kids had it in you.

897
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,273
Nice work men.

898
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,574
Anyway, as you know

899
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,077
we've got our big formal in a couple weeks.

900
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,580
Traditionally, we hold a car wash to pay for the expenses.

901
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,816
I need someone to take charge

902
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,151
and I need volunteers for washing.

903
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,521
Oh, I would be delighted to advance the interests

904
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,692
of the school by organizing and supervising the cleansing

905
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,061
of the automobiles, Sister.

906
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,163
Great! You'd be perfect.

907
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,733
We'll shoot for next Saturday.

908
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,636
Now come on, Kathleen, let's go get that money.

909
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,638
Yes, Sister.

910
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,416
I don't believe this!

911
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,987
Jerry, are you out of your gourd?

912
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:46,990
Nice digs you got here.

913
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,792
Get out of here!

914
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,227
Oh! He's coming in!

915
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,995
Be quiet, this could be interesting.

916
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,197
Beautiful night for a party, isn't it?

917
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,600
Don't you think you've already gotten me in enough trouble?

918
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,902
I talked to the nun, you're off the hook.

919
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,237
THERESA: Who's he?

920
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,405
Evening ladies.

921
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,340
THERESA: There are no boys allowed in this dorm!

922
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,876
That's okay, we're not boys, we're men.

923
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,478
Please Jerry, someone's going to come up here for sure.

924
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,147
Door's locked, isn't it?

925
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,149
You don't look like a Greek god to me.

926
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,850
Greek god? I missed one workout.

927
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,052
Give me a break, okay?

928
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,653
I don't believe this.

929
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,922
We just broke into a girls' dorm room.

930
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,757
Hi! I'm Melanie.

931
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,192
Uh, Theo.

932
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,795
Jerry, if you don't get out of here, I'm calling the guard.

933
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,096
Come on Christy, 30 minutes

934
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,664
and we are out of here.

935
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,467
Word of honor, I absolutely swear,

936
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,736
you will not get into trouble.

937
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,037
Are you a pre-vert?

938
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,372
Oh, never on the first date.

939
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,641
Hey, would you guys mind keeping your voices down?

940
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,076
Are you always this nervous?

941
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,944
You guys, we could play some strip Monopoly.

942
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,981
Or regular.

943
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,552
I would like to propose a toast to Virgin High,

944
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,656
to moonlit nights, champagne and viva la difference ,

945

947
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,930
Hasta bazoolo.

You're a ghost at this school.

That's Kathleen.

1016
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,332
I told you you'd make nice friends.

00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,667
Friends for life.

1018
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,369
So, uh, are you looking forward

1019
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,438
to the big formal next week?

1020
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,873
Actually, I wasn't even planning on going.

1021
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,476
Not going? Of course you're going.

1022
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,211
You don't want to miss the big social event

1023
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,446
of the year, do you?

1024
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,215
I don't feel like it. Besides I don't even have a date.

1025
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,450
What do you mean?

1026
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,051
Sure you have a date.

1027
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,820
I do?

1028
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,289
I knew you wouldn't be having much contact with boys this

1029
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,192
semester, so I invited Leonard Klappner

1030
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,593
to escort you.

1031
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,830
Leonard Klappner, duh, Dad, I don't think so.

1032
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:31,501
A fine young man: smart, intelligent, well-mannered

1034
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:35,972
Dad, I don't think...

1035
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:39,643
Actually, your mother and I might stop by ourselves.

1036
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,612
Uh, I've already discussed it with Sister Felicia and

1037
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,314
she's more than happy to have us.

1038
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,849
Dad, I wasn't even planning...

1039
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,517
So, we'll see you at the formal

1040
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,752
and keep up the good work.

1041
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,120

Haven't you?

1045
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,462
No, Mommy, no!

1046
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,066
(WHIMPERING) No.

1048
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,862
Oh, God!

1049
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:10,433
That was the most awesome experience I have

1050
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,471
ever had without the use of a controlled substance.

1051
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,741
Was it as good for you as it was for me, Kathleen?

1052
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:19,909
I've got it!

1053
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,145
What?

1054
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,380
I should have thought of it earlier,

1055
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,783
but I have definitely got it.

1056
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,487
You told me those tests came back negative!

1057
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,290
Not that sweet vacuum skull.

1058
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,127
I figured out a way we can get Murphy.

1059
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,130
(DEREK CHUCKLES) We?

1060
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:44,401
Now you told me you were an expert with explosives, right?

1061
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,836
Not exactly. I told you that once in high school

1062
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,705
I cherry bombed the girls' john.

1063
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,973
Well, whatever.

1064
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:53,877
I figure we take your expertise

1065
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,979
and combine it with my expertise in painting.

1066
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,216
And with a little help from the Happy Whip company

1067
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,254
we'll give young Miss Murphy a send-off to remember.

1068
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:06,523
What are you scheming?

1069
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:09,259
I don't like the sound of this at all.

1070
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,194
Derek, honey,

1071
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:16,199
have you ever made love in a Jacuzzi full of Jell-O

1072
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,169
with a full set of leather accessories

1073
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,506
and the Brandenburg Concerto playing at high volume?

1074
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,909
No.

1075
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,610
Do you think you'd like to?

1076
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:28,878
Yes.

1077
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,714
But not at any price.

1078
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,683
I do have principles you know.

1079
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,351
Yes, the same principles

1080
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:38,421
the nuns will respect and admire you for,

1081
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,560
if they ever find out, God forbid, that you've been

1082
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:48,965
porking one of their sweet innocent little angels.

1083
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,234
What do I do and when do we start.

1084
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,908
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

1085
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,354
(ENGINE STOPS SPUTTERING)

1086
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,597
So you studs ready for the big night?

1087
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,566
Hell yeah, Jer. I even bought some pope-a-lactics.

1088
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,469
I can't believe you tried every one of them on.

1089
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,137
They're one size fits all.

1090
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,572
Sounded fishy to me.

1091
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,909
So, Jer, I can't believe you're not going to this party.

1092
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,178
As much as it hurts,

1093
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,548
sometimes you just have to face the truth.

1094
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,450
I just wasn't invited.

1095
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,353
Heavy.

1096
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:45,188
Anyway, Jer, got any pointers on helping me

1097
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,656
get this girl to give out?

1098
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,458
Give out?

1099
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,660
You know, shut up or put down!

1100
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,464
Hide the baloney, okay?

1101
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,634
Now, Zoom, babe,

1102
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,435
you have to understand that women have a completely

1103
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,638
different perspective on things than say,

1104
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:05,675
you, me, or even Theo over here.

1105
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,278
So what you gotta do is be prepared.

1106
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:11,381
Now you already bought the raincoats and that's good.

1107
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,649
But if it goes that far,

1108
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,550
be shocked to find them in your wallet.

1109
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:17,153
Like, say maybe I must have planted it there.

1110
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,089
Never let the chick know that the whole thing

1111
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,291
was premeditated.

1112
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:24,093
Oh yeah, right, take it from Dr. Pocket Pool over there.

1113
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,496
Contrary to Theo's belief,

1114
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,865
the five knuckle shuffle does not grow hair on your palms.

1115
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:34,938
Listen, women love to talk.

1116
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,572
So talk to her.

1117
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:40,376
Use big words, talk about the environment, Jane Fonda.

1118
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,045
Bullshit like that.

1119
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:46,182
And if all else fails, go for the cones.

1120
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,884
At least you'll go down fighting.

1121
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,899
Come on Christy, you should be excited like we are.

1122
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,967
It's going to be fun.

1123
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,368
That's easy for you to say.

1124
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,103
You're not going with Leonard Klappner.

1125
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,205
He can't be that bad, can he?

1126
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,576
Okay. But at least you can have fun.

1127
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:15,545
There's going to be dancing and food.

1128
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,680
You can't keep moping about Jerry forever.

1129
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,215
I'm not really moping.

1130
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,018
I'm just wondering if maybe I was a too hard on him.

1131
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,053
I mean the water fight really wasn't his fault.

1132
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,254
Zoomer started it.

1133
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,456
I know.

1134
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,124
You think maybe I should give him another chance?

1135
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,326
I don't know.

1136
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,562
But this is not the time to think about it.

1137
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,897
Now, are you going to get over here and be

1138
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:35,932
frivolous with us or not?

1139
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,301
Sure.

1140
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,473
You keep barging in here like that and we're gonna

1141
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,174
have to start locking the door.

1142
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,377
I'm sorry.

1143
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,811
Actually, I came here because

1144
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:51,447
I have something to say to Christy.

1145
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,520
Christy, I'm sorry.

1146
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,056
Excuse me?

1147
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,792
I just feel like such a jackass.

1148
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,494
I've been thinking about it all week

1149
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,263
and I just feel like dirt for the things I've said to you.

1150
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:10,033
Did the nuns send you over here?

1151
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,634
No!

1152
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:15,405
I just realized why I've been so mean to you.

1153
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,140
Why?

1154
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,342
Because I was jealous of you,

1155
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,777
all of you!

1156
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,979
I mean you're all such great friends

1157
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,248
and I never had that.

1158
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:28,518
I mean, and then I realized

1159
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,187
that the reason I don't have any friends

1160
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,390
is because I am such a bitch!

1161
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,526
Can you imagine that?

1162
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,529
So I decided from this day forward,

1163
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,497
I'm cleaning up my act.

1164
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,801
No more threats, no more nastiness,

1165
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,003
just goodness and light

1166
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,138
and goodwill toward all.

1167
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,107
What do you say?

1168
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,309
Great!

1169
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,412
VOICE ON PA: Attention, Christy,

1170
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,847
do not be fooled,

1171
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,249
she is a lying bitch

1172
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,618
and cannot be trusted.

1173
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,587
That is all.

1174
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,090
Well, I was thinking.

1175
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:10,259
We should take up a collection and buy a gift for the school.

1176
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,995
Oh, the other day

1177
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,432
I saw this painting of the Blessed Virgin

1178
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,669
that would be just perfect.

1179
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,271
And then we write a little inscription on the bottom.

1180
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:25,341
And then somebody gives a, a speech at the formal.

1181
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,976
I don't know...

1182
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,179
You, Christy!

1183
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,015
And then we'll have the grand unveiling!

1184
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,951
How does that sound?

1185
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,921
Sure, we can go with that.

1186
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:42,458
Great! Oh this is just going to be super.

1187
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,061
Just like the four Musketettes!

1188
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,471
Hey, hey Jose.

1189
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,006
Zoomer. It's a formal.

1190
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,008
You're supposed to rent a tux.

1191
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,310
Hey I haven't got that kind of cash-ola.

1192
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,180
Besides, I wanted to do the casual thing.

1193
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,414
Damn! I don't believe

1194
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,350
I forgot to order Melanie a corsage.

1195
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,051
What?

1196
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,521
There was only one left and some prom clown

1197
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,289
snaked it before I could.

1198
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,259
Oh, totally uncool.

1199
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,162
You don't want your babe to think you're some kind of wimp, do ya?

1200
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,664
I was going to spend $10 on that too.

1201
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,034
Well, maybe, but I didn't bring one.

1202
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,570
My babe would have slapped me.

1203
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:28,838
You want me to look bad?

1204
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,406
It was refrigerated and everything.

1205
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,278
This doesn't feel right. Jerry should be with us.

1206
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,412
Where's my hat?

1207
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,447
Maybe it's best that he's not here this time.

1208
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,884
Hey, hey, hey, Jose! He's our bud.

1209
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,487
Yeah.

1210
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,290
You think he's bumming?

1211
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,493
Probably.

1212
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,361
Hey, why don't we jam over to his place,

1213
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,729
cheer him up and then ask him if he wants

1214
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,897
to crash it with us.

1215
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,433
Well, he's not crashing it with us,

1216
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,569
but we could see how he's doing.

1217
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,604
We're gonna be late to pick up the girls!

1218
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,573
Let them wait, we're studs!

1219
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,213
Theo, really, where's my hat?

1220
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,646
(KNOCKING)

1221
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,281
Entrez .

1222
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,850
Hey, hey, Jose!

1223
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,485
So how do we look?

1224
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,855
You look like a couple of gonads.

1225
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:54,557
Oh, thanks. We love you too.

1226
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,025
What are you guys doing here?

1227
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,361
We just wanted to come and cheer you up a little.

1228
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,097
By reminding me that you two dorkuses have dates

1229
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,100
for the formal while I, the wizard of studliness,

1230
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:06,102
get to stay home with the Mario Brothers?

1231
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,937
Thanks a lot, that's very thoughtful.

1232
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,472
Jesus, Jer, lighten up.

1233
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,307
It's not like you to be so depressed.

1234
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,375
Yeah, in fact, I can't believe

1235
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,110
you've given up on Christy so easy.

1236
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:16,445
She's right Zoom. I'm bad luck for her.

1237
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,382
Some things are just not meant to be.

1238
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,650
Would you listen to this?

1239
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,485
The wizard of studliness.

1240
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,054
No, look, you guys just go.

1241
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,689
Have a great time.

1242
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,892
I'd rather slit my wrists in private anyway, okay?

1243
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:31,827
Oh, that's great. I mean,

1244
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,729
I know we're gonna have a blast now.

1245
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,333
Just kidding, no listen guys, just go ahead, just go.

1246
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,902
Come on, Jer. We can't, we can't leave you like this.

1247
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:41,504
You're not leaving me like anything.

1248
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,972
Just go.

1249
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,341
Come on, Jerry, we'll get a little tapioca pudding,

1250
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:47,310
some babes, a little baby oil,

1251
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:48,711
put them in a little swimming pool.

1252
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,112
We'll get real dirty.

1253
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,581
Bye.

1254
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,650
Oh, Jesus. Let's get out of here.

1255
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,122
PARROT: What a couple of geeks! Brawk!

1256
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,176
Are you boys just about ready?

1257
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,310
Any time, Sister.

1258
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,479
Oh, good. Here's your list of songs.

1259
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,548
List?

1260
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,417
Tie A Yellow Ribbon? Kum By Ya?

1261
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,021
You really expect us to play this stuff?

1262
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,857
Well, of course. Why not?

1263
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,593
Well, you know, It's not our type of thing. You know?

1264
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,663
Oh, now, now young man. Let's not forget

1265
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:43,099
who's paying the piper tonight?

1266
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,170
(ROCK MUSIC)

1267
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,407
That's not on the list.

1268
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,511
Good evening, Sister Felicia!

1269
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,680
Oh, hi, Kathleen.

1270
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,582
I can't tell you what an

1271
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,918
enormous pleasure it is to be here this fine evening.

1272
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,353
That's nice.

1273
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,423
Is there anything I can help you with?

1274
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:12,061
No, no, you and your date just go and have a good time.

1275
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,996
Well, I don't have a date.

1276
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:16,899
I don't plan to date until I'm 21.

1277
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,502
I'm saving myself for my husband.

1278
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,404
Really?

1279
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:25,741
That certainly is a refreshing notion in this day and age.

1280
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,116
Hi, guys and girls!

1281
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,484
ALL: Hi, Sister.

1282
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,287
Are you kids all set to get in there and boogi-oogie?

1283
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,524
Oh, yes, ma'am. We're ready to get uptight, out of sight

1284
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,626
I want to you to remember the rules: there will be

1285
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:47,863
no loud talking, no slurping the punch, no close dancing,

1286
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,767
and keep both feet on the floor at all times.

1287
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,969
Now, you kids get in there and enjoy yourselves.

1288
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,404
ALL: Yes, Sister.

1289
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,342
Whoo-whoo!

1290
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,553
You got all the stuff in place?

1291
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:15,324
Mmm-hmm, and I got a little something extra.

1292
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:18,994
You idiot. Do you want to blow the whole thing?

1293
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,165
I just thought that you and I would get together later,

1294
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,366
that's all.

1295
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,534
Well, it's too risky.

1296
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,838
Just get rid of it and meet me in the storage room.

1297
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,353
Oh, Sister Romona!

1298
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,323
Oh, look at the boys and girls having such a good time.

1299
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:48,424
Isn't this fun?

1300
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:52,094
Yes, it, it truly is a lovely party, Mommy!

1301
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,429
Oh, ho!

1302
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,698
Well now we better make sure that they do behave them...

1303
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,967
Oh, look, look at that couple over there, Sister.

1304
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,203
Just a little too close. You take care of it.

1305
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,405
Go get them, Sister Romona!

1306
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,908
So, I figured I'd gamble, right?

1307
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,511
Grab the old five iron and lofted

1308
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,147
a perfect fader around the tree.

1309
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,452
Bit the green like a piranha, rolled uphill

1310
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:20,389
and bingo, in the cup, 180 yards!

1311
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,124
Can you believe that?

1312
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:24,126
That's awesome, Leonard.

1313
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,961
Next week I'm gonna get a new set of Pings.

1314
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,805
Yo! Sister!

1315
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,440
Leonard Klappner!

1316
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,509
How do you do, Leonard? Hello, Christy.

1317
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:41,710
Sister.

1318
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:45,114
Your folks, they haven't arrived yet, have they?

1319
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,283
No, but they should be here pretty soon.

1320
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,319
Now, I'm sure there's no need to remind you

1321
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,721
how important it is you make a good impression

1322
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:53,789
on them tonight.

1323
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,459
Hey! With me how could things go wrong?

1324
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,764
KATHLEEN: Good! It's phenomenal!

1325
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,266
I can't wait to see the look on Murphy's face when she

1326
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,003
gets in front of the whole school and unveils this.

1327
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,374
You are a real devil, Kathleen.

1328
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,578
You got the cherry bombs?

1329
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,580
Yeah. All hooked up and ready to blow.

1330
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,949
All I have to do is set the timer.

1331
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,385
And the whip cream.

1332
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,121
Ah, I can't wait.

1333
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:29,358
Now the presentation is at 10:00 p.m.

1334
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,528
So you meet me back here at five of, sharp!

1335
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,930
You got it?

1336
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,232
Anything for you, honey dumplings.

1337
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,987
Heck of a party, eh, Sister?

1338
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,222
Your Excellency, you made it!

1339
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:02,324
Well I wouldn't want to miss your big event.

1340
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,927
Any sign of you know who?

1341
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,263
No, and I don't know what's keeping them.

1342
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,198
I'd hate to see them back out now.

1343
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,166
We wouldn't want this to be your last hurrah,

1344
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,234
now would we?

1345
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,069
We certainly wouldn't, Bishop.

1346
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,982
Sister Felicia, what's in this punch?

1347
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,751
What's in it?

1348
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:32,955
Well it's sherbet, fruit punch all the usual stuff. Why?

1349
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:37,660
It's excellent. I've never tasted anything like it.

1350
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,795
Oh really? I'll have to have some.

1351
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,630
Oh, yes, please.

1352
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:43,832
Ahh!

1353
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,107
Can I help you, young man?

1354
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,909
No I'm just here to take a few pictures.

1355
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,811
I'm sorry, I don't remember hearing anything

1356
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,579
about a photographer.

1357
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:00,649
Listen, ma'am, all I know is the school already paid for

1358
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,152
the service and the studio sent me over here.

1359
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,820
I can either do it or not.

1360
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,523
It doesn't matter to me.

1361
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,992
Well, all right, if we paid for it.

1362
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:28,077
Now the way I see it,

1363
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,378
with your looks

1364
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:32,348
and my brains and looks,

1365
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,250
we could produce a whole litter of super achievers!

1366
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:43,125
You want my studley body, I mean, admit it.

1367
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:46,061
Leonard, don't make me put a footprint in your scrotum.

1368
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,963
It wouldn't be pretty.

1369
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,267
I love it when you talk violent.

1370
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:54,470
Mmm!

1371
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,972
Where are those Murphys?

1372
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,679
Oh, Dick, isn't this romantic?

1373
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,348
It reminds me of our very first date.

1374
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,651
We went to Arby's on our first date.

1375
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,587
No that was our second.

1376
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:15,257
My prom was our first.

1377
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,660
Now seeing it all here again,

1378
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,496
it just makes me want to...

1379
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,498
Ooh, you know what.

1380
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,366
Margaret, please!

1381
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,935
This a proper gathering.

1382
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,670
Save it for later.

1383
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,518
Boy, oh, boy, Sister! If you could bottle this stuff

1384
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:46,121
and sell it, your money troubles would be over.

1385
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:49,391
It sure beats and car sales and bake washes.

1386
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:50,692
Ahh! Yeah!

1387
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,995
Good evening, folks.

1388
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:56,031
Well, well, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Moneybags.

1389
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,068
I beg your pardon?

1390
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,071
Excuse us, Mr. Murphy, we're all just on kind of

1391
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,307
natural high tonight.

1392
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,508
Here try some punch. Oh, thanks.

1393
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,649
I think you all be very pleased with the little

1394
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:14,917
piece of paper I brought

1395
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,318
here to hand over to you tonight.

1396
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,353
Oh, Mr. Murphy!

1397
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,289
I know that God is saving

1398
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,925
a special place in heaven for you.

1399
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,028
Holy shit!

1400
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:29,932
I mean, wow, this punch is fantastic.

1401
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,669
Margaret, try some, try some, Margaret.

1402
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,037
Smile everybody.

1403
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,342
Do you believe in pre-marital interdigitation?

1404
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,577
No way!

1405
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,178
What's that?

1406
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:45,948
Do you believe in pre-marital oscullation?

1407
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,883
You really are a pre-vert, aren't you?

1408
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,418
Hey, don't knock it until you've tried it.

1409
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:53,455
Jesus! Pardon my goose.

1410
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,857
Have you guys seen Christy anywhere?

1411
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,258
Because I have to find her right away.

1412
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,426
She's around here someplace.

1413
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,495
I'm don't know if she wants to see you though.

1414
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:02,564
Hey does Jerry Kaminski know what he's doing or what?

1415
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,666
Tell her, Theo.

1416
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,668
He's got no idea what he's doing.

1417
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:14,443
Oh, Dick, I just feel so warm and gooey inside.

1418
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,880
I could just beat the hell out of you!

1419
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,449
No, please, Margaret, not now.

1420
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:23,318
All right, baby. Whoo! Sorry, folks.

1421
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,055
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

1422
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,590
Hey, young love birds.

1423
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,992
Hi, Dad, hi, Mom.

1424
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,727
Are you having a good time?

1425
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,795
You bet we are, sir. I mean,

1426
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,297
I may just have to take this young girl off

1427
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,132
your hands one of these days.

1428
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,577
Well, Christy,

1429
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,446
it seems they finally made a young lady out of you.

1430
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,615
I trust you're not going to blow it.

1431
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:57,085
Come on, Margaret, let's get some more of that punch.

1432
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,957
All right!

1433
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,261
Ahh.

1434
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:16,738
Ow!

1435
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,073
Thank you, Sister.

1436
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,141
Christy!

1437
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,342
Hi.

1438
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,577
The presentation is going to be any minute now.

1439
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,613
Are you all set to do your thing?

1440
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:25,681
I think so.

1441
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,850
Wow! This is going to be all time.

1442
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,553
I'm going to go set everything up. All right.

1443
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,856
Leonard! Why don't you go take a cold shower?

1444
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,327
Yo, baby!

1445
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,896
To the Academy!

1446
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,134
Hey take one of us!

1447
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,739
Leonard, will you knock it off!

1448
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,474
Oh, momma!

1449
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,076
Damn it, Leonard!

1450
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,510
Oh, no.

1451
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,246
What? Not tonight of all nights.

1452
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,916
Who? The photographer?

1453
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,352
I should have known he'd show up here.

1454
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,053
You want me to kick his ass?

1455
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,190
No Leonard, just block his view and don't let him see me.

1456
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,257
Oh!

1457
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:14,796
Psst!

1458
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,450
One more toast!

1459
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,852
To our hero!

1460
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,592
Oh, that's our cue. Come on campers!

1461
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,527
Let's go, Sister Fellatio!

1462
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,670
Hi, everybody.

1463
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:58,373
ALL: Hi, Sister Felicia.

1464
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,409
Are we all having fun?

1465
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,310
(DRONING) Mmm.

1466
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,213
Oh, you can do better than that!

1467
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,949
Come on, are we all having fun?

1468
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:10,052
(DRONING) Mmm.

1469
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,086
That's better.

1470
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,457
Well, first a few announcements.

1471
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,159
The field hockey team is

1472
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:21,463
playing St. Elizabeth's for 6th place next Tuesday.

1473
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,732
It's already started. Hurry up!

1474
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:25,934
Hurry Up! Damn it!

1475
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,070
I'm going as fast as I can.

1476
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,372
And don't forget,

1477
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:33,975
there's an extra confession scheduled for tomorrow

1478
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:38,647
for those of us that have had too much fun tonight!

1479
01:18:39,714 --> 01:18:41,383
HAUGHNESS: Oh, yeah!

1480
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:44,219
(HAUGHNESS AND FELICIA LAUGHING)

1481
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:57,065
(HAUGHNESS AND FELICIA STILL LAUGHING)

1482
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:01,670
Woo! That was wild.

1483
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:07,476
Well, now we have some wonderful news

1484
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:10,011
for the Academy tonight.

1485
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:15,183
I'm going to hand it over to Mr. Dick... Murphy

1486
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:17,052
to tell us all about it.

1487
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,754
Mr. Murphy.

1488
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,562
Thank you.

1489
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,464
Is this working?

1490
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:30,499
(FEEDBACK RINGING)

1491
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,034
Sister Felicia,

1492
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,637
Bishop Haughness,

1493
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,839
students and friends,

1494
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:42,844
on behalf of the Gelt Gouger Foundation

1495
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:46,014
and in recognition of your school's achievements,

1496
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:50,152
I'd like to present you with this check

1497
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:53,622
for $350,000.

1498
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:10,238
Oh, thank you, thank you so much Mr. Murphy

1499
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:14,376
or as you will always be known to us, St. Dick.

1500
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:27,556
Well, next on the agenda we're going to...

1501
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:36,064
Before Bishop Haughness says a few words to us,

1502
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,332
I've been told that there's

1503
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,034
one more important announcement.

1504
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,669
Christy, come on.

1505
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:47,175
Um, because the Academy has been such a

1506
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:50,345
special place for us to go to school, the senior girls would

1507
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:53,682
like to dedicate a small token of our esteem to the Academy.

1508
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:55,917
Sister, your Excellency,

1509
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,522
a few words in parting...

1510
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,923
Did I mention what a great group

1511
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,558
of seniors we had this year?

1512
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,694
What the heck is she talking about?

1513
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:12,334
JERRY: Get Kathleen up there!

1514
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,603
Kathleen, yes, Kathleen,

1515
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,605
let's get our very own Kathleen up here.

1516
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:19,975
No, no way, I can't I have nothing prepared.

1517
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:22,510
Stage fright. I have stage fright, okay?

1518
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,045
Oh, come on Kathleen.

1519
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,914
Everybody knows this is your baby.

1520
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,682
Come on up here and give her a rip.

1521
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,784
No, no, I can't really, I can't.

1522
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,721
Oh, the hell with it.

1523
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,155
No wait!

1524
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,159
Holy headlights!

1525
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,563
What?

1526
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:44,232
FELICIA: Kathleen! Derek! What is the meaning of this?

1527
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:45,800
Bye!

1528
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,769
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?

1529
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,571
Derek, go after her.

1530
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:54,843
Christy, what the Sam Hill is going on here?

1531
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,045
I thought it was a picture of the Blessed Virgin!

1532
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,813
Right and I'm the king of Siam.

1533
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,315
CHRISTY: No really I did.

1534
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:02,884
Oh, Mr. Murphy, we are so sorry.

1535
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:06,187
I assure you, we are going to catch those guilty parties

1536
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,256
and they will be punished.

1537
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,761
For your sake I hope so.

1538
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:15,563
But in the meantime, I certainly can't let the

1539
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,966
good name of the Gelt Gouger Foundation

1540
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,467
be associated with a place

1541
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,803
where this kind of thing goes on.

1542
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:26,908
Oh, now wait a second here. Let's not be rash.

1543
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:28,910
Sorry, I've got my responsibilities.

1544
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:31,513
Christy, pack your mukluks.

1545
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:32,580
We're leaving.

1546
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,882
CHRISTY: Dad, please...

1547
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,084
Oh please, Mr. Murphy, if you could just reconsider.

1548
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:40,021
No! No! No!

1549
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,690
(GUNSHOTS)

1550
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:45,126
Come on, Margaret, we're leaving.

1551
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,775
Oh!

1552
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:04,245
This is not what it appears to be.

1553
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:10,218
Sister, this wouldn't go beyond here, would it?

1554
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,989
Hey, who did that?

1555
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,658
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

1556
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:20,061
We all have our responsibilities.

1557
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,263
Now wait just one minute!

1558
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,165
Oh, forget it, Dick.

1559
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,734
They've seen us.

1560
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,337
I'm getting some punch.

1561
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,741
Margaret, wait!

1562
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,046
Oh, what the hell!

1563
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,349
Let's party.

1564
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:54,229
Hit it, dudes!

1565
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:07,642
Christy, your father has something to say to you.

1566
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,277
Go ahead, Dick.

1567
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:12,881
Right. Well under the circumstances...

1568
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:15,750
Honey, I just wanted to...

1569
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,553
I can't quite figure out how to say it.

1570
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:21,356
He's sorry for jumping to conclusions about you.

1571
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,159
Yeah, and well,

1572
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,527
what I mean is...

1573
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,497
He feels maybe he's been a little too strict with you.

1574
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:33,835
Uh-huh, because the thing is... How can I put this...

1575
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,671
He only did it because he loves you.

1576
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,273
But now that you're older

1577
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,575
maybe we can learn to trust you a bit more.

1578
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,844
Right. That's it.

1579
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,480
Dad, I never thought I'd hear you say that.

1580
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:47,615
Don't worry dear, you didn't.

1581
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:50,819
Let's go, hot stuff!

1582
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,768
So, I'm just getting up to speed

1583
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,470
and there's this unwelcome thud on the

1584
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,904
ragtop of my cruiser.

1585
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,973
No! Mr. Murphy?

1586
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,142
Old St. Dick himself.

1587
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,411
I guess I shouldn't have parked in their driveway.

1588
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,246
I guess that's why fathers don't like

1589
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,915
buying expensive prom dresses for their daughters.

1590
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,217
Why's that?

1591
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,519
Because they know that sometime during that night,

1592
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,721
it's going to end up wrapped around her ears.

1593
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:29,324
So what happened to Christy?

1594
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,292
Packing her mukluks as we speak.

1595
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,794
They're sending her to Godthab.

1596
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:34,295
Godthab, where's that?

1597
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,630
Greenland.

1598
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:38,166
What's the plan now Jerry? You gonna go up to Greenland

1599
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:40,535
and bust in to Godthab dressed as an Eskimo?

1600
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:43,705
THEO: That's Greenland, Zoomer, not Alaska.

1601
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,340
JERRY: Actually, guys, this time

1602
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:47,675
I thought I'd dress up as a gynecologist.

1603
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,444
ZOOMER: You mean a poon doctor?

1604
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,079
(LAUGHING)
