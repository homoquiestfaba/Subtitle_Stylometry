1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,710
(soothing music)

2
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,421
(eerie music)

3
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,947
(music intensifies)

4
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:21,900
(music swells)

5
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:58,531
(music intensifies)

6
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,344
[Voiceover] Now it begins.

7
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,880
My name is Jack Deth.

8
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,750
I come from the year
2353, and I hunt trancers,

9
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,053
super-strong single-minded
zombies who exist mostly,

10
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,588
I think, to make my life difficult.

11
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:56,225
Except I finally managed to
wipe them out once and for all.

12
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,808
And my life is still difficult.

13
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,351
I work for the council
now, jumping up and down

14
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,665
the timeline, preserving the

15
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:07,584
correct chronological order of things.

16
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,241
Time is fluid, and I'm
the guy who makes sure

17
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:12,158
the glass doesn't get knocked over.

18
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:15,663
Welcome back, Jack.

19
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:16,706
How did the mission go?

20
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:19,861
You're the whole
welcoming committee, Harris?

21
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:20,694
Where's Alice?

22
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,932
Where's Raines?

23
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:24,667
I'm starting to feel
pretty damn unappreciated.

24
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,443
First things first, Jacky.

25
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:27,610
The Solonoids.

26
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,885
Rest easy, Harris.

27
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:32,441
Those disgusting plant
creatures may have invaded 2093,

28
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,611
but that's as far as they got.

29
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:35,740
Good work, Jack.

30
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,907
Where's Shark?

31
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,523
About Shark.

32
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:40,987
Jack.

33
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,326
Shark is a state of the art android.

34
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,326
Where is it?

35
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,251
I gotta admit, I had my doubts at first,

36
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:50,001
but he saved my life.

37
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:51,997
The best partner I ever had.

38
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,538
Had.

39
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:54,371
God.

40
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:56,445
Ugh.

41
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:01,269
Tell me at least there's
something salvageable.

42
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,019
Define salvageable.

43
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:05,670
Oh, lord.

44
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,682
Look at it.

45
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,290
Don't call him it.

46
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,258
He was my partner.

47
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,329
Give him some respect.

48
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,626
So what do we suggest we do with him?

49
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,101
I dunno.

50
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,458
A hood ornament.

51
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,625
A lamp, maybe.

52
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:20,648
What a crime.

53
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,351
You coulda used him as
backup on your next mission.

54
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,574
Next mission?

55
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,557
Fuck that. I need some time off.

56
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:28,640
Look, Harris.

57
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,029
I need to see Alice.

58
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:32,862
She was my wife.

59
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:34,137
Now where is she?

60
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:34,970
Jack.

61
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:40,208
Things have changed a little around here.

62
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,958
Alice and I, we're...

63
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,703
We're pretty close to each other.

64
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,673
You son of a bitch.

65
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:52,486
She didn't have the heart to tell you.

66
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,748
And you got no heart.

67
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:56,054
That's not fair, Jack.

68
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,471
I need a drink.

69
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:04,721
You know, I should've saved
the solonoid for you, Harris.

70
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,198
(upbeat techno music)

71
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,439
Scotch.

72
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,516
[Voiceover] How do you want that?

73
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:25,933
In a Glencairn.

74
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:29,843
Hi, I'm Jack Deth.

75
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,843
You're kidding.

76
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,310
Your name isn't really Jack Deth.

77
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,650
No, but in my line
of work, I didn't think

78
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,239
anyone would take Maurice Deth seriously.

79
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,683
Hit me again, barkeep.

80
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,274
What is your line of work?

81
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,722
Trancer hunter.

82
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,602
Well, I wiped them all out.

83
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:50,794
Now I work for the council,

84
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,833
pretty much doing the same thing.

85
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,870
So you're a professional killer.

86
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,703
Look, lady.

87
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:56,536
Lyra.

88
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:57,869
My name is Lyra.

89
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,699
You know jack shit about me.

90
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,294
Jack shit?

91
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,274
Cousin of yours?

92
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,864
My mistake.

93
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:07,697
You look lonely.

94
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,099
It'd be a shame for a woman
like you to be sleeping alone.

95
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,110
Youarrogant.

96
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,617
Hey, babe.

97
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:14,470
This old man bothering you?

98
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,826
Let me take care of him.

99
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:18,565
Why don't you take
care of yourself, pal?

100
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:20,541
Fuck you mean by that?

101
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,576
You explain it to him.

102
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,576
Use lots of small words.

103
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,329
Hey, asshole.

104
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:36,481
Feel proud of yourself?

105
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,193
Feeling tough?

106
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:39,776
Lady, I am tough.

107
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:43,581
All this, just because you were worried

108
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:46,184
I'd be sleeping alone?

109
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:49,501
Is this your usual way
of attracting partners?

110
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,334
I never sleep alone.

111
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,724
♫ I just don't see

112
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:02,132
♫ Why is it so hard to be relieved ♫

113
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:28,526
Excuse me.

114
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,492
I'm supposed to pick up some
weapons from a doctor...

115
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,325
Surrell?

116
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,465
Dr. Lyra Surrell.

117
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,717
Jack Shit, isn't it?

118
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,111
So you were just
screwing around last night.

119
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:46,534
You knew damn well who I was.

120
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,306
You make weapons to help
guys like me kill people?

121
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:53,182
I make weapons to help
guys like you stay alive.

122
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:56,515
You could convince me otherwise, though.

123
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,732
You might remember this?

124
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,570
The long second watch.

125
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,144
One second becomes 10.

126
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:05,594
The rest of the world slows down.

127
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,261
Saved my ass a couple times.

128
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,206
Too bad it only has a
single charge element.

129
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,948
We've made some improvements.

130
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,241
It now has a self-regenerating power cell.

131
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,574
You can use it indefinitely.

132
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:21,055
Multi-purpose blade.

133
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:23,814
Cuts through anything.

134
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:29,206
An RBG-7.

135
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:32,117
Latest technology.

136
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:33,999
RBG-7.

137
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,717
What does RBG stand for?

138
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:39,707
Really Big Gun.

139
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:41,249
It's not that big.

140
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,190
It's not the size that matters, Jack.

141
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,857
It's how you use it.

142
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,024
Fires plasma blasts, and is equipped with

143
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:51,193
an atomic distillation
chamber in the gun butt.

144
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:53,103
No ammo clip necessary.

145
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,018
If you're in the desert, use sand.

146
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:57,279
A forest, rocks, pebbles, twigs.

147
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,402
It all breaks down, it's all the same.

148
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:03,569
All you've got to do is shove
it up your butt, so to speak.

149
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,370
Nasty piece work.

150
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,940
You should be very happy together.

151
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,859
Is that all the retorts
you can come up with?

152
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:16,850
I would've made you an
inflatable doll of me,

153
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,734
but I didn't have the time.

154
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,056
Too bad.

155
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,758
I coulda let out some of its hot air.

156
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:25,267
Use your little pen to prick it.

157
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,184
Better than the other way around.

158
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,930
You know what your problem is?

159
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,932
You're going to tell me, right?

160
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:37,058
Your problem is that
you're a beautiful women,

161
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:38,873
but too smart for your own good.

162
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,290
You got a body that won't quit and,

163
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,756
unfortunately, a mouth to match.

164
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:46,923
You might want to be a
little less smart sometime.

165
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,704
You know what's nice about you?

166
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:51,537
Yeah.

167
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:52,787
Nothing, right?

168
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,988
You don't know what's nice about you.

169
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,540
That's your problem.

170
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,473
And you do.

171
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:01,132
I do.

172
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:02,759
But I won't tell you because

173
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,092
that's just me being smart again, right?

174
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:08,075
Right.

175
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,354
Be careful.

176
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,413
Those weapons are expensive.

177
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:28,218
I knew you'd be back, Jack.

178
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:29,607
You're one of those guys who's not happy

179
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,457
unless he's working.

180
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,973
Any one of those guys
who's not happy unless

181
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,517
he's fucking someone's old lady.

182
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:37,684
How long did you expect her to wait?

183
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:44,260
So where the hell are
you sending me this time?

184
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,333
What we've got is an indication
of the time distortion,

185
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,666
emanating for the year 2160.

186
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,997
Could be nothing, but...

187
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,795
It could be something.

188
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:18,493
(machine whirring)

189
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,084
Can you hear me, Jack?

190
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,062
[Jack] Yeah.

191
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:25,473
The point of origin
seems to be Topeka, Kansas.

192
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:29,151
We've preset the time
and space coordinates.

193
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,068
Cycle is now activated.

194
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:35,624
There's no turning back now, Jack.

195
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,777
I wish I could give you a
better idea of what to expect.

196
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,999
Don't worry about me.

197
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,416
I love surprises.

198
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:53,445
Solonoid.

199
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:54,846
Shit.

200
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:55,679
Jack?

201
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:00,807
(machine beeping)

202
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:03,947
What the hell is going on up here?

203
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,030
A solonoid.

204
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:08,341
It must've regenerated
itself in the TCL chamber.

205
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:11,008
Jack's trapped in there with it.

206
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,029
We can't override the system.

207
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:15,862
I can.

208
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,695
Hurry.

209
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,318
It's gone.

210
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,151
He's gone.

211
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:28,517
Where is he?

212
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,703
We lost telemetry.

213
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:33,453
He could be anywhere.

214
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:41,408
(foreboding music)

215
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:56,381
(solonoid growls)

216
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,516
Something tells me I'm not in Kansas.

217
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:18,229
Swell.

218
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,215
(woman screams)

219
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:35,529
(woman groans)

220
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:42,861
Hold it.

221
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,111
What the hell?

222
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:56,017
A trancer.

223
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:59,425
You're a fucking trancer.

224
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,421
Whose meat are you?

225
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:02,254
I'm nobody's meat.

226
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,671
I'm Jack Deth, and you're coming with me.

227
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,135
I'm Borgia.

228
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,370
Where do you propose to take me?

229
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,203
Run.

230
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,232
Run like hell.

231
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:15,419
He'll drain you dry.

232
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,252
Run.

233
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:22,207
Charming toy.

234
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,624
You must let me play with it.

235
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,807
(dramatic music)

236
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:12,986
I think not.

237
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:19,732
(dramatic music)

238
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:14,273
(discording piano music)

239
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,844
(foreboding music)

240
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:36,244
Lord Caliban.

241
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:38,304
Lord.

242
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:41,831
Lord?

243
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,536
(serious music)

244
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,157
(lady moans)

245
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:19,104
(serious music)

246
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,384
Why do you disrupt my feeding, Lucius?

247
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,731
My apologies, Lord.

248
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:37,148
In the Hall of Nobles, disastrous, lord...

249
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:39,419
Softly, Lucius.

250
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,419
You're in my sanctum.

251
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,458
Not the greater halls during a feast.

252
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,875
Compose yourself.

253
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,171
Compose myself?

254
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,041
My lord, Borgia is dead.

255
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,041
How am I expected to compose myself?

256
00:18:58,824 --> 00:19:00,074
Composed now?

257
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,983
Good.

258
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:06,524
Now, what is all this about Borgia?

259
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,218
We were in the Hall of Nobles

260
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:16,768
where the best and
greatest of the trancers

261
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,823
have their talismans and representation.

262
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,401
I'm well aware of the condescents

263
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:23,042
in Hall of Nobles, Lucius.

264
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,716
Then Borgia's statue
suddenly started to smoke.

265
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:28,808
The chest almost exploded.

266
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,984
Then the statue simply collapsed.

267
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:34,552
And when was the last
time anyone saw Borgia?

268
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:36,800
He went out hunting some hours ago.

269
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,532
He said food always tastes
better after a struggle.

270
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,380
Yes, well it appears
that Borgia's last meal

271
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,047
struggled more mightily
than he anticipated.

272
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,238
Lord Caliban, what does this mean?

273
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,548
Means that Borgia was a fool.

274
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,579
But it also means trouble.

275
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,753
You'll find, my dear Lucius...

276
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,096
That death can come in the
most unexpected manner.

277
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,781
(birds chirping)

278
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:36,435
(horse neighs)

279
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,264
Here we go.

280
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,507
Here we go, girl.

281
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,924
Come on, come on.

282
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:54,937
What?

283
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,104
The man had...

284
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:00,820
An exploding light hammer?

285
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:03,976
What is an exploding light hammer?

286
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:06,275
She was merely frightened
by the trancer's attack.

287
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,363
Nothing more.

288
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:10,418
Obviously, there is
something more, Harson, for

289
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:14,585
she is here and frightened,
rather than there and dead.

290
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,514
Tessa, why did you not talk
to him after it was all over,

291
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:22,201
after risking your skin chasing after him?

292
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,997
Why run off?

293
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:25,982
I was afraid.

294
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:28,544
He was very fearsome.

295
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:31,273
If I could do it over
again, I would've asked him

296
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:34,061
to join us, to help lead us.

297
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,661
Nonsense.

298
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,726
We do not need some stranger to come here

299
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:39,900
and lead us to the death and destruction.

300
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,529
The stranger overpowered
and killed a noble.

301
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,444
If he can kill one, he can kill more.

302
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:51,696
And I'd follow a man like
that into the gates of hell.

303
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:54,601
If he truly existed, which he does not.

304
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,991
Do you believe that?

305
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:59,788
It makes more sense than
exploding light hammers.

306
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:00,621
Tessa.

307
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:04,784
Are you certain?

308
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,034
Perhaps it was not a hammer.

309
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,762
Maybe it was...

310
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:13,595
A gun.

311
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,512
It is called a gun.

312
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:20,328
It is a weapon.

313
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,516
I have seen it coming.

314
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:27,876
Tell me, Tessa.

315
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,080
The man you saw.

316
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,438
Did he look like this?

317
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,785
And the weapon.

318
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:47,618
Did it look like that?

319
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,821
Are you convinced now, Harson?

320
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:59,355
This man could put an
end to our nightmare.

321
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:00,772
We must find him.

322
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:04,048
He could be anywhere.

323
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:08,215
It will be like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

324
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:40,452
(men clamoring)

325
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:43,517
Hey, you.

326
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:44,350
Me?

327
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,229
Yeah.

328
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:46,809
Why do you not bow?

329
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,642
There's no applause.

330
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:52,830
You think you are amusing, yeah?

331
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:08,385
(serious music)

332
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,399
You're one of those
blood-sucking creatures

333
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:14,756
I saw in the woods, like the one I offed.

334
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,423
You killed Borgia?

335
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:35,869
Hoy!

336
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:36,846
After him!

337
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,054
There he is!

338
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:39,137
Follow him!

339
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:45,629
(energetic violin music)

340
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:47,011
[Voiceover] Look down there.

341
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:48,502
[Voiceover] Go find the horses, quickly.

342
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:49,335
[Voiceover] Come on!

343
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:51,189
[Voiceover] Quickly!

344
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,356
There it is!

345
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:56,406
[Voiceover] Up here!

346
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:04,321
Our enemy takes form.

347
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:08,528
He killed no one this time.

348
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,842
Not for want of trying.

349
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:15,209
Lord.

350
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,837
Have you considered that this new threat

351
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:19,754
can be in league with, with Oberon?

352
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:23,744
Oberon is dead, Lucius.

353
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:25,661
I destroyed him myself.

354
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,101
Do you doubt my word?

355
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:30,851
No, no, not at all.

356
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:39,994
But whatever this intruder's
origins, he must be dealt with.

357
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:42,716
With your permission,
I would like to assign

358
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:45,522
all the nobles of Orpheus
to hunt down and...

359
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:47,526
We'll do no such thing, Lucius.

360
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,711
But, my lord!

361
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,905
The rebirth ceremony
of my son is imminent,

362
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:53,249
the single most important
event in Prospero's life,

363
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:56,019
and I will not let it be ruined by nobles

364
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,207
running here and about like mere sheep.

365
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:01,703
Now we have a wolf in
the fold, true enough.

366
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:04,672
But sheep, under terror from the wolf.

367
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,339
Hawks, however, fly undisturbed.

368
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,756
Would we be sheep or hawks, Lucius?

369
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:20,545
And if more should die to his hand?

370
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:25,608
Well, then, they were
not worthy, Lucius.

371
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:32,083
I will capture this wolf's head.

372
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:37,691
(serious music)

373
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:55,056
Prospero.

374
00:26:56,219 --> 00:27:00,052
Your father has requested
not to be disturbed.

375
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,427
May I be of service?

376
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:06,314
No, Lucius.

377
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,438
As you wish.

378
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:15,034
(soft violin music)

379
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:23,782
My lord Prospero.

380
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:25,339
Yes?

381
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:28,254
[Woman] Not to be too bold,
but have you yet chosen a maid

382
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:32,429
to serve you at your rebirth
because if you have not,

383
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,012
I would be honored.

384
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:40,029
Why would you willingly
offer yourself to this?

385
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,366
[Woman] My lord?

386
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,596
I'll contemplate it.

387
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,542
Thank you, my lord.

388
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:58,391
(foreboding music)

389
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,743
No, no.

390
00:28:13,743 --> 00:28:14,910
Do not sit up.

391
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:18,488
What happened?

392
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,082
You passed out.

393
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,999
I believe the bleeding has stopped.

394
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:25,210
Who are you?

395
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:27,336
Sebastion.

396
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:29,221
Sebastion?

397
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:31,724
Who are you?

398
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,265
Jack Deth.

399
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:37,015
Deth, a harsh name.

400
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:41,673
Well, it's a harsh world,
whatever world this is.

401
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:43,508
You mind filling me in?

402
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:45,467
Filling you into what?

403
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,880
Where the hell am I?

404
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,380
You do not know?

405
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:52,811
You're quick, you know that?

406
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:55,967
You truly do not know where you are?

407
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,217
That's right.

408
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:03,772
Well, this place is called Orpheus.

409
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,740
There used to be others like
me until the nobles came.

410
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,573
Nobles?

411
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:10,980
Bloodsuckers.

412
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,813
Yes.

413
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:15,148
Some people say they
came from another world.

414
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:16,398
We're not sure.

415
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:20,165
One night, one hideous night,

416
00:29:22,237 --> 00:29:25,070
they came swarming over the hills.

417
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,433
The slaughtering was...

418
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:35,802
There are so few of us left.

419
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:42,383
The nobles, they have powers.

420
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,833
They can become stronger than us, faster.

421
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:49,914
When they use these powers,

422
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,581
their faces, they go crazy, yes?

423
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:55,819
Yes, that is right.

424
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:57,630
They call it trancing.

425
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,463
Yeah.

426
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:02,493
They do not stay that way, of course.

427
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:03,403
They don't?

428
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:06,392
No, they restore
themselves using humans,

429
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:08,475
draining our life energy.

430
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,540
They call us meat.

431
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,763
Oh, they can't kill all of you.

432
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:15,420
They'll run out of food.

433
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,253
Right.

434
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:19,962
So they draw off a little at a time.

435
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:23,765
There can be no harm to us as
long as it's done carefully.

436
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:27,421
We regain our strength given time.

437
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:31,487
Sometimes, though, when they're
feasting, they lose control.

438
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:32,320
There's warning.

439
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,375
You can actually see them glow.

440
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,958
Their aura changes.

441
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,973
As long as it is white, you are safe.

442
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,806
When it turns blue, that's danger.

443
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:45,402
And when it's red.

444
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:47,891
There's nothing left.

445
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:50,224
We all live in fear of it.

446
00:30:51,922 --> 00:30:52,780
You can't live in fear.

447
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,515
You gotta fight back.

448
00:30:54,515 --> 00:30:56,645
Well how can we fight back?

449
00:30:56,645 --> 00:31:00,380
Well, if I get a little
stronger, I'll tell you.

450
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,937
What is this shit?

451
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:03,922
Herbal remedy.

452
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:08,089
It will replenish your strength,
but first you must rest.

453
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,513
(bird coos)

454
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,936
(festive music)

455
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:35,744
(crowd chatters)

456
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:00,514
Quiet.

457
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:05,843
Make your places, everyone.

458
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:13,676
My good friends, my good friends,

459
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:16,618
I thank you all for coming tonight,

460
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:20,451
for as you know, this
is a momentous occasion.

461
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:25,858
This is the night when my son,
my Prospero, will be reborn.

462
00:32:31,913 --> 00:32:32,746
Prospero.

463
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:39,135
(triumphant music)

464
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:00,130
There comes a time in the life of everyone

465
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,172
born to the nobility when his
or her heritage calls to him,

466
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:07,672
pulls at him, as the moon pulls the tides.

467
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:12,598
It is at this point
when a noble comes fully

468
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:16,598
into power, the strength
that is his birthright.

469
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,769
The time has come for you, Prospero.

470
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:23,019
The need surges within you.

471
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:27,101
The need for meat.

472
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,207
Prepare my son's first meal.

473
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,530
(suspenseful music)

474
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:03,630
Look at them, Prospero.

475
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,297
Ready, willing, eager
to be your first meat,

476
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:14,110
and be the first meat for son of Caliban.

477
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,188
There can be no greater honor than that.

478
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,188
Alright, my son, choose.

479
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:22,897
Choose.

480
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:29,954
[Together] Choose, choose, choose!

481
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:31,871
Choose, choose, choose!

482
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:35,152
Choose, choose, choose!

483
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:38,372
Choose, choose, choose!

484
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:41,385
Choose, choose, choose!

485
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:44,535
Choose, choose, choose!

486
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:47,575
Choose, choose, choose!

487
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:50,774
Choose, choose, choose!

488
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:52,436
Meat, meat, meat!

489
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:53,853
Meat, meat, meat!

490
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,970
Meat, meat, meat!

491
00:34:58,361 --> 00:34:59,778
Meat, meat, meat!

492
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,147
Meat, meat, meat!

493
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:05,638
Meat, meat, meat!

494
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:07,055
Meat, meat, meat!

495
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,723
Meat, meat, meat.
[Prospero] No!

496
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:15,031
I cannot do this, father.

497
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:15,948
I will not.

498
00:35:20,825 --> 00:35:23,742
(soft flute music)

499
00:35:35,848 --> 00:35:38,765
(foreboding music)

500
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,918
There's a message, my lord.

501
00:35:58,454 --> 00:35:59,704
What message?

502
00:36:15,664 --> 00:36:17,254
Who fights these noble trancers?

503
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:21,003
There are rumors about,
they call them tunnel rats,

504
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:22,020
the people who hide from the nobles

505
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,601
in the many caves and forests of Orpheus.

506
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,731
But it is unlawful.

507
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:27,321
If you are a temple rat,
you are apprehended.

508
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:28,771
Yeah, yeah, I know the routine.

509
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,313
All I gotta do is find these tunnel rats

510
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,849
so I can nail these trancer
bastards once and for all.

511
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,148
But no one knows where they hide.

512
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:37,833
Someone knows.

513
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,750
No, please.

514
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,441
Stay just a little longer.

515
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:43,044
What the fuck's wrong with you?

516
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:46,794
(horse neighs in background)

517
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,033
You son of a bitch.

518
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,321
The nobles take care of me.

519
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,154
They're not so bad.

520
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:58,904
Yeah, they're fucking vampires.

521
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,399
Are you hurt?

522
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:05,707
No, my lady Titania.

523
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,457
If you harm him, I'll kill you.

524
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,527
Like this, huh?

525
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:18,618
One move and this meat becomes prime cut.

526
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,913
(dramatic music)

527
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,893
Pleasure to meet you, wolf's head.

528
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:43,976
I am Caliban.

529
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:48,832
It appears that you have run out of time.

530
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:50,611
Bullshit.

531
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,652
I got plenty of time.

532
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:13,062
Is this some bizarre attempt at levity?

533
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:20,490
Clearly, the device
on his wrist possesses

534
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,573
some sort of crude magic.

535
00:38:38,378 --> 00:38:41,128
(crickets chirp)

536
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,693
[Jack] Lyra.

537
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:49,860
If that's what you wish
to call me, I am now Lyra.

538
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,214
Oh, hell.

539
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:55,647
Oh, shit.

540
00:38:57,526 --> 00:38:59,193
This is not a dream.

541
00:39:01,326 --> 00:39:03,128
What the hell are you doing here?

542
00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:04,711
I was born here.

543
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:06,941
I have always been here.

544
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:08,191
Always will be.

545
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:11,134
You're crazy.

546
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:12,532
I do not think I am crazy.

547
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:15,692
I haven't had any other
life that I recall.

548
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:17,636
Yeah, yeah, okay.

549
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:21,803
Let's just say you're who you
say you are, just for laughs.

550
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:28,713
You did not want me to laugh?

551
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:29,546
What's wrong with you?

552
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:31,601
Why are you acting this way?

553
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,801
Tell me how you want to act and I will.

554
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:35,634
Why?

555
00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:39,687
It's what Caliban wishes me to do.

556
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:40,520
Caliban.

557
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:45,180
That's the guy that waltzed
in and knifed Sebastian.

558
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,034
He is the master of
the castle of all of us.

559
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,534
Hell, not to me.

560
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,992
I'm getting the hell out of here.

561
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:55,825
No.

562
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:57,312
Please don't.

563
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,145
What is this?

564
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,236
Some kind of trick you
people think you can pull...

565
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:00,069
Can what?

566
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,925
Kill you?

567
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:01,910
You laid there helpless.

568
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,234
We could've killed you a dozen times over.

569
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:06,817
Why are you here?

570
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:10,402
Because Caliban told me to be here.

571
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:14,569
Because I'm to do for you
whatever you wish, to please you.

572
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:20,053
Whether you want to or not.

573
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:21,886
Of course I want to.

574
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:27,319
Please, don't go.

575
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:30,075
Caliban's already furious with me.

576
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:31,492
I failed his son.

577
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,724
I wasn't attractive enough.

578
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:40,069
Caliban told me he would
give me one last chance.

579
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:43,540
He sent me here to give you pleasure.

580
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,373
Hmm.

581
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:47,836
He's got respect for you.

582
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:49,896
I beg of you.

583
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:52,204
Let me please you.

584
00:40:52,204 --> 00:40:54,037
My life depends on it.

585
00:40:55,507 --> 00:40:58,174
Well, anything to save a life.

586
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:07,141
(serious music)

587
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:13,315
Prospero.

588
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,357
One leads by example,
and one does not lead

589
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:21,451
by having one's only son
publicly shun our way of life.

590
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:24,422
Father, I've walked among them.

591
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:26,266
I have seen their faces.

592
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:28,266
I have seen their fears.

593
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:31,799
We're nothing more than parasites.

594
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,216
We take and take.

595
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:35,395
My son.

596
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,051
I never realized until
this moment just how much

597
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:43,468
you remind me of your mother.

598
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,618
I wish I remembered her better.

599
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:52,368
She was bold, but very foolish.

600
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,243
It's subversive.

601
00:41:55,243 --> 00:42:00,237
She actually harbored a
distaste for our way of life.

602
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:01,320
So misguided.

603
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:08,283
I never dreamed, Prospero,
that she had managed

604
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:11,283
to pass her misguided ways onto you.

605
00:42:15,196 --> 00:42:17,339
You cannot deny your heritage.

606
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,427
Food may sustain our
bodies, but life force.

607
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,260
That is what makes us what we are.

608
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:29,042
Prospero, I have never
ever raised a hand to you.

609
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,369
I know, father.

610
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:42,449
But you will feast.

611
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:47,507
[Prospero] Go to hell!

612
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:54,172
Those were your mother's last words.

613
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:58,794
Pray that they're not yours.

614
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:08,968
I saw him brought into the castle.

615
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:11,063
If we're going to get
him out, the only way

616
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:12,919
is through the forgotten tunnels.

617
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,913
We closed them off for a reason.

618
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:15,900
If they discover those tunnels,

619
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,716
they will use them against us.

620
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:19,443
We have no choice, Harson.

621
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:21,179
Who knows what manner of torture

622
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:23,512
they're putting him through?

623
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:29,361
Lyra, isn't there anything
you're interested in?

624
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:33,536
You think I am stupid, don't you?

625
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:34,369
Hell, no.

626
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,981
It's real genius to live
like this, do this, do that,

627
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,150
quake when Lord Caliban to come around.

628
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,733
And you're satisfied with that?

629
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:45,691
I am not satisfied.

630
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,662
You don't know how
difficult it is, living...

631
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:49,495
Save it.

632
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:52,273
I was hoping you'd turn
out to be something

633
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:54,682
more than just another
whining squid brain,

634
00:43:54,682 --> 00:43:57,502
some dizzy ditz from Melrose who shops...

635
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:58,752
How dare you?

636
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,678
You sit in judgment of me.

637
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:05,587
You are the one who is the
squid brain, Jack Deth.

638
00:44:05,587 --> 00:44:06,420
Good.

639
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,995
You don't take any shit from me.

640
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:11,003
You're showing signs of life.

641
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:11,992
You are pleased that I let you.

642
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:12,825
Yeah.

643
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:20,730
You know, there's this woman
where I come from, Lyra.

644
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,190
You know, I would love it if
she would be more like you.

645
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,828
So instead, I wind up trying
to get you to be more like her.

646
00:44:28,828 --> 00:44:32,219
Where did you come from, Jack Deth?

647
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:33,552
Another world.

648
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:38,725
A parallel universe, another dimension.

649
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:42,912
All I know is I ain't from here.

650
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:45,759
Back home, the trancers
aren't running the joint,

651
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:47,981
and my weapons work right.

652
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:48,814
Damn.

653
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:51,078
My weapons.

654
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:02,559
This guy, Caliban.

655
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,865
How long has he been in charge?

656
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:06,844
For as long as I can remember.

657
00:45:06,844 --> 00:45:08,966
Did he ever get hassled
by the tunnel rats?

658
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,238
They're afraid of him.

659
00:45:10,238 --> 00:45:11,846
Everyone is.

660
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:14,143
He is very powerful.

661
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:14,976
Really?

662
00:45:22,374 --> 00:45:23,928
You try and trance me, I swear to god,

663
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:25,141
I'll rip your throat out.

664
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:25,974
You got that?

665
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,158
Please, please, I beg of you.

666
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:28,105
Let me live.

667
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:29,522
I'll do anything.

668
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,412
Just take me to my weapons.

669
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:35,579
Let's hurry.

670
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:41,756
(lively flute music)

671
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,670
It is through here.

672
00:46:04,753 --> 00:46:06,836
Excellent work, Lucius.

673
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:10,537
Thank you, my lord.

674
00:46:28,156 --> 00:46:29,665
[Voiceover] Well, well.

675
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,248
That will hold you.

676
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:38,651
So, wolf's head.

677
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:43,955
Enjoying the pleasures that
life here has to offer you?

678
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:46,741
You're on this little setup, huh, Lyra?

679
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:47,574
Lyra?

680
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,167
Is that what she's calling herself now?

681
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:54,417
Lyra's a charming creature.

682
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:59,945
But subterfuge is not her strongest suit.

683
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:02,090
What's the point, then?

684
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,423
The point is, wolf's head,

685
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:08,929
I have a great deal to offer you,

686
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:14,210
and all you have to do in
return is to be honest with me.

687
00:47:18,654 --> 00:47:19,487
Lucius.

688
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,871
What have you learned?

689
00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:23,992
I admit, I did not understand much

690
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:25,523
of what he was talking about, my lord.

691
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:30,108
Something about dimensions,
parallel universes.

692
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:30,941
Mm.

693
00:47:31,803 --> 00:47:32,886
As I thought.

694
00:47:34,372 --> 00:47:36,320
There are worlds, Lucius, within worlds

695
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,491
with things like this.

696
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:39,324
A weapon?

697
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:44,122
And this is the trigger, I assume.

698
00:47:45,308 --> 00:47:49,475
Why don't you put it in
your mouth and find out?

699
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:52,747
Now this...

700
00:47:53,952 --> 00:47:56,202
Mystifies me, I must admit.

701
00:47:57,214 --> 00:48:01,282
It appears to have a handle, but for what?

702
00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:02,782
There's no weapon.

703
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:05,824
A charm, perhaps.

704
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:10,274
Where did you get it?

705
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:13,261
Charm school.

706
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:17,299
Show me the way to
your world, Jack Deth,

707
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:19,347
and I will give you power.

708
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:22,097
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

709
00:48:24,033 --> 00:48:25,824
The only thing I'm dreaming about is

710
00:48:25,824 --> 00:48:28,491
kneeling your sorry trancer ass.

711
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:41,175
So, you will not lift a
finger to avert your death.

712
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:44,758
I got your lifted
finger right here, pal.

713
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:49,203
And I got your death right here...

714
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:52,207
Pal.

715
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:57,976
(suspenseful music)

716
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:02,278
Master, please.

717
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:03,188
Release him.

718
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:04,965
I promise you, I'll do anything.

719
00:49:04,965 --> 00:49:07,298
You'll do anything anyway.

720
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:16,020
Costel.

721
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:19,957
Take your iron right
down his dying screams.

722
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,481
It may be of use later.

723
00:49:21,481 --> 00:49:22,314
Jack.

724
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,093
Lucius.

725
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,546
I'm very sorry.

726
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,168
(suspenseful music)

727
00:49:46,285 --> 00:49:48,702
(soft music)

728
00:50:08,177 --> 00:50:11,177
(suspenseful music)

729
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:27,994
Harson, no!

730
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:30,839
Wait!

731
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:31,902
Will you help us?

732
00:50:31,902 --> 00:50:32,735
What?

733
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:34,763
He's not like the others.

734
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,502
I've seen that myself.

735
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:37,951
What do you want?

736
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,451
Not what, who, and before it's too late.

737
00:50:54,663 --> 00:50:58,163
[Voiceover] The prisoner, he's escaping!

738
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:22,840
(energetic music)

739
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:30,062
Stop!

740
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:43,157
Please, hang on.

741
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,521
Don't do it!

742
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:14,438
This way.

743
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,166
Here, come on.

744
00:52:20,216 --> 00:52:21,049
Bolt the door.

745
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:21,882
We broke the lock.

746
00:52:21,882 --> 00:52:22,715
Pile things up.

747
00:52:22,715 --> 00:52:23,548
Hurry.

748
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:29,690
You're the tunnel rats.

749
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,523
Yes.

750
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,533
There's no way out of this place.

751
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:33,366
We got weapons.

752
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:34,442
We can fight our way out of here.

753
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,626
Not necessary.

754
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:37,959
Our way in is our way out.

755
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,120
What about him?

756
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,645
[Shaleen] He comes with us.

757
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:54,478
[Jack] You're crazy.

758
00:52:54,478 --> 00:52:55,910
What would you prefer?

759
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:59,316
We leave him here so he can
show them our escape route?

760
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:00,601
I'll take care of him.

761
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:02,354
He spared your life.

762
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:05,712
How do you pay that back
where you come from?

763
00:53:05,712 --> 00:53:06,962
With bloodshed?

764
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:18,348
Stand aside.

765
00:53:31,886 --> 00:53:32,830
Find them.

766
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,663
Now!

767
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:39,868
I'll be damned.

768
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:42,723
You saying that was
painted before I got here?

769
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:44,873
Our wisest, Farr, made them.

770
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:46,319
He has the sight.

771
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,152
Mm-hmm.

772
00:53:49,074 --> 00:53:49,907
Now, this.

773
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:54,775
What's happening there?

774
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:56,419
Your future.

775
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:58,586
Jack Deth, this is Farr.

776
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:02,430
You're saying it's my future to climb up

777
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,597
on a cliff and be struck by lightning?

778
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:08,690
It is your destiny.

779
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:09,857
Yeah, right.

780
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:13,511
(soft piano music)

781
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:16,124
We do not seek out your fate.

782
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:18,874
It will you seek you out instead.

783
00:54:23,616 --> 00:54:26,533
(soft flute music)

784
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,103
(music swells)

785
00:54:55,402 --> 00:54:56,771
Prospero?

786
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:59,071
Get away from me.

787
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,738
Let me die in peace.

788
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:03,725
You can fight this.

789
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:12,055
You don't remember me, do you?

790
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,410
I remember you.

791
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,646
It was three seasons ago.

792
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:22,733
I was a new bride and my
husband was young and loving.

793
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:28,931
We were on our way to our new home,

794
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:33,598
and that caught the eye
of a noble named Lucius.

795
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:36,598
He and several others came after me.

796
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:42,769
My husband fought them
and they drained him dry.

797
00:55:47,272 --> 00:55:51,439
And when they turned to me,
and was about to do the same.

798
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:57,008
In that last moment, a
young noble came riding up.

799
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,515
Do you know what he said?

800
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:04,348
Enough.

801
00:56:05,805 --> 00:56:08,638
Gods above, she's suffered enough.

802
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,291
Yes.

803
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:17,684
And you told me to run and
I've kept running until now.

804
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:31,943
I swear to you, my lord.

805
00:56:31,943 --> 00:56:33,418
We've been through the weapons room.

806
00:56:33,418 --> 00:56:34,835
There is no exit.

807
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:38,052
Then look again, Lucius.

808
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:42,017
They couldn't have just disappeared.

809
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:46,082
With all respect, my
lord, if they are back by

810
00:56:46,082 --> 00:56:48,082
the magic of Oberon, I...

811
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,363
Speak that name again,

812
00:56:51,363 --> 00:56:54,613
and you will speak no names ever again.

813
00:56:56,184 --> 00:56:58,517
There is one more problem.

814
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:02,610
Prospero is nowhere to be found.

815
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,487
He may be with Jack Deth
and whoever took him.

816
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:09,904
We think it may be the tunnel rats, but...

817
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:10,737
Perfect.

818
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:15,951
(mystifying music)

819
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,171
Something personal.

820
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:45,330
Something.

821
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:02,708
Personal.

822
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,710
(chants in foreign language)

823
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,433
Prospero.

824
00:58:27,592 --> 00:58:30,342
(dramatic music)

825
00:58:43,138 --> 00:58:46,138
(music intensifies)

826
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:05,037
No exit, huh?

827
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,700
We have some rats to exterminate.

828
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:13,268
This guy, Caliban.

829
00:59:13,268 --> 00:59:14,341
What is he afraid of?

830
00:59:14,341 --> 00:59:16,176
He got any weak spots?

831
00:59:16,176 --> 00:59:20,772
Caliban and his trancers
did not always rule.

832
00:59:20,772 --> 00:59:22,892
The power of Orpheus comes rested

833
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,559
with a very potent and
benevolent wizard named Oberon.

834
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:31,000
Caliban did away with
him, but he still fears

835
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,417
the wizard and his vengeance.

836
00:59:35,892 --> 00:59:37,824
How did he do away with him?

837
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:41,574
Poisoned him then
burned his body to ashes.

838
00:59:44,238 --> 00:59:46,007
There's something I'm missing here.

839
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:49,539
How could this Oberon
be any kind of threat?

840
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:53,839
Something as trivial as
death won't stop a true wizard.

841
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,406
Wizards don't die.

842
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:59,633
They're just metaphysically
inconvenienced.

843
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:00,509
Magic again?

844
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:01,503
I don't buy any of that bullshit.

845
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:03,221
It only hurts if you let it.

846
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:06,428
There's a technical term
for someone such as you

847
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:08,223
who believes they can survive an encounter

848
01:00:08,223 --> 01:00:12,140
with a wizard shielded
only by their disbelief.

849
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:14,676
And that term is...

850
01:00:14,676 --> 01:00:15,509
Skeptic?

851
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:17,999
Dead meat.

852
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,844
Why do you have to feed?

853
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:28,402
We have no souls.

854
01:00:28,402 --> 01:00:30,485
Inside, we are just cold.

855
01:00:34,454 --> 01:00:38,621
When we feed, it is the only
time that we know warmth.

856
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:43,692
I was cold, too, the day your people,

857
01:00:44,715 --> 01:00:47,132
the nobles killed my husband.

858
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,237
Please, I will not be able to hold back.

859
01:00:52,237 --> 01:00:54,154
I do not want you to.

860
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:57,635
I am tired of running.

861
01:00:59,825 --> 01:01:02,742
(soft flute music)

862
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,183
We do not need you here.

863
01:01:18,183 --> 01:01:19,861
We fared well enough on our own.

864
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:21,815
Yeah, right, living
your lives on the run

865
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,171
from vampire trancers.

866
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:24,280
You guys had a way into the castle,

867
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,064
and you didn't use it 'til now.

868
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:26,897
You know why?

869
01:01:26,897 --> 01:01:28,304
'Cause you're afraid.

870
01:01:28,304 --> 01:01:30,593
It wasn't fear that
stopped us, Jack Deth.

871
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:31,941
How would you fight nobles?

872
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:35,272
I'd take the fight to 'em, god damn it.

873
01:01:35,272 --> 01:01:36,772
Now, we're even.

874
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,312
Trancer son of a bunch.

875
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:43,425
No, he wasn't hurting me.

876
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:45,343
I was helping him.

877
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,682
You gave yourself over
to him on purpose, why?

878
01:01:47,682 --> 01:01:49,282
That may not matter much longer.

879
01:01:49,282 --> 01:01:50,115
What do you mean?

880
01:01:50,115 --> 01:01:51,682
My father approaches, I sense it.

881
01:01:51,682 --> 01:01:52,577
Who's your father?

882
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:53,410
Caliban.

883
01:01:57,597 --> 01:01:59,347
We gotta work fast.

884
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:03,698
(dramatic music)

885
01:02:32,088 --> 01:02:33,421
Rats are here.

886
01:02:36,872 --> 01:02:39,622
(dramatic music)

887
01:02:42,498 --> 01:02:44,915
Farr, we haven't much time.

888
01:02:46,368 --> 01:02:47,701
I'll be along.

889
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,864
Angelo, Serene, Provost.

890
01:03:07,878 --> 01:03:09,128
Scout on ahead.

891
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:20,325
Spread out.

892
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:22,325
Find them and kill them.

893
01:03:25,355 --> 01:03:26,522
Kill them all.

894
01:03:30,845 --> 01:03:31,678
There!

895
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,935
Look at this.

896
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:39,852
Such fools.

897
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:57,488
Who are you?

898
01:04:01,062 --> 01:04:03,062
No one of consequence.

899
01:04:04,422 --> 01:04:05,922
That's for sure.

900
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,630
I'm going to give you the

901
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,463
fair fight you never gave my husband.

902
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,463
You bastard.

903
01:04:38,014 --> 01:04:40,264
I knew I'd find you here.

904
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:46,836
Time to come home with me, son.

905
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:47,669
No.

906
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:51,275
You've changed.

907
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:52,108
Yes.

908
01:04:53,245 --> 01:04:55,077
You've been reborn.

909
01:04:55,077 --> 01:04:57,527
Just as I anticipated.

910
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:00,165
Here amongst the meat,
you could not resist,

911
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:02,748
and now, now we'll be together.

912
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:05,548
Together in hell.

913
01:05:15,988 --> 01:05:18,488
Your heart's not in this, boy.

914
01:05:19,659 --> 01:05:20,492
Mine is.

915
01:05:23,229 --> 01:05:25,146
En garde, motherfucker.

916
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,869
(dramatic music)

917
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,519
Have you seen them?

918
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:04,352
Hey.

919
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:14,887
(dramatic music)

920
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:30,609
(music swells)

921
01:06:37,757 --> 01:06:40,056
You made a major error, wolf's head.

922
01:06:40,056 --> 01:06:40,889
The last thing in this world

923
01:06:40,889 --> 01:06:43,259
that you want is for me to notice you.

924
01:06:43,259 --> 01:06:46,009
And now that I have, you're dead.

925
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:54,154
Beautiful.

926
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:08,461
You will not harm her,
not while I am alive.

927
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:13,941
Then you shall die.

928
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:28,024
How can you be the son of Caliban?

929
01:07:30,511 --> 01:07:34,678
It is I who by all rights should
fill his lordship's boots.

930
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:55,225
Prepare to die, son of Caliban.

931
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:09,910
I must find Jack Deth.

932
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:16,558
(foreboding music)

933
01:08:18,793 --> 01:08:22,172
[Voiceover] You still don't
get it, do you, wolf's head?

934
01:08:22,172 --> 01:08:23,255
I am Caliban.

935
01:08:24,817 --> 01:08:27,317
This is my world, my universe.

936
01:08:28,387 --> 01:08:30,304
You have no place here.

937
01:08:32,386 --> 01:08:33,469
This place.

938
01:08:34,313 --> 01:08:36,876
This is the place that Farr talked about.

939
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:38,500
Wolf's head.

940
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,629
I've got you a present.

941
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:40,596
Jack!

942
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:41,968
Let her go.

943
01:08:41,968 --> 01:08:44,244
Tell me how to get to
your world, Jack Deth.

944
01:08:44,244 --> 01:08:45,250
I don't know how.

945
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,083
I'm trapped here.

946
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,087
My showing up was an accident.

947
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,920
That is unfortunate.

948
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:51,952
No!

949
01:08:53,983 --> 01:08:56,900
(triumphant music)

950
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:01,307
Oberon.

951
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,100
I got nothing to lose.

952
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,213
Jack Deth, wait.

953
01:09:20,518 --> 01:09:21,663
Where are you?

954
01:09:21,663 --> 01:09:23,414
Where are you?

955
01:09:23,414 --> 01:09:24,657
It's not where I am.

956
01:09:24,657 --> 01:09:26,240
It's where you are.

957
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,117
You're knocking at death's door,

958
01:09:30,117 --> 01:09:32,534
and I've got the goddamn key.

959
01:09:35,102 --> 01:09:38,102
(music intensifies)

960
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:43,061
Wait, kid.

961
01:09:44,035 --> 01:09:44,868
He would've killed us all.

962
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:46,161
Is that what you want to save?

963
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:46,994
Huh?

964
01:09:50,392 --> 01:09:52,059
I'm sorry, father.

965
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,700
I had no son.

966
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:13,180
You hear anything?

967
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,494
Just the pounding of my heart.

968
01:10:14,494 --> 01:10:15,327
What else?

969
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,526
Nothing.

970
01:10:18,526 --> 01:10:20,305
Caliban, is he?

971
01:10:20,305 --> 01:10:21,812
Gone.

972
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:23,044
My father is gone.

973
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:26,500
I should feel relieved now that it's over.

974
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,520
It's not over yet.

975
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,355
I'm still stuck here with no way home,

976
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,679
and I hear wizards don't die.

977
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:36,262
They're just metaphysically
inconvenienced.

978
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:42,198
(laughter)

979
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:58,574
(dramatic music)

980
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:45,106
(music swells)

981
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,320
(music intensifies)

982
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:08,068
(music softens)

983
01:13:41,355 --> 01:13:44,355
(soft flute music)
