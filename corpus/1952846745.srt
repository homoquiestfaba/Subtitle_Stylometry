Shitheads,

356
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,554
but eventually
I'll find someone incredible.

357
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,295
I'm gonna cancel.

358
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,230
No, you're not.

359
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,485
(woman)
Hi.

360
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,853
I'm Sandy Clarke,
Mick's producer.

361
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:32,222
We spoke
on the phone.

362
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,225
This is Big Tex.

363
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,394
<i>Oh, you look great,</i>

364
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,162
especially the lips.

365
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,364
[Buzzer]

366
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,901
Uh, just want to let you know
we're gonna end

367
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:47,470
with the vaginal
odor warning strips.

368
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,006
<i>(Mick)
So tell us, Jamie.</i>

369
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,308
<i>How did you become a namer?</i>

370
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,512
I had a roommate
who sold medical supplies.

371
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,247
She got me my first job.

372
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,315
Which was?

373
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,883
Naming a catheter.

374
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:00,918
[Laughter]

375
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,419
I wanted to call it
Urine Trouble,

376
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,554
but they wanted something
more positive.

377
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,588
It wasn't so negative.

378
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,591
It could have been called
Urine Bloody Deep Shit.

379
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,792
[Laughs]

380
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,929
Actually,
you're not allowed to mention

381
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,197
blood or shit
or piss or come,

382
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,765
but gas is fine.

383
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,335
[Laughter]

384
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,404
Um, so after catheters,

385
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,374
I moved on to antidepressants.

386
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,376
Ooh.

387
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,712
I named Upanol.

388
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,681
I took Upanol.

389
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,050
I nearly went impotent.

390
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,551
[Laughs]

391
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,485
[Clears throat]

392
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,529
So you're gonna name an SUV.

393
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,765
Where do you start...
by taking a meeting

394
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,700
with those buggers
at General Motors?

395
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,635
Oh, I don't get those jobs.

396
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,671
I get really weird jobs,

397
00:22:54,673 --> 00:23:00,277
like electric strollers
with global positioning.

398
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,446
But someday, hopefully,

399
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:06,416
you'll graduate onto
the off-road vehicles.

400
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,417
Maybe.

401
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,119
But those jobs are boring.

402
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,888
They all want the same thing...

403
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,123
a new Cherokee.

404
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,625
There's only one minority
for car manufacturers:

405
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,960
American Indians.

406
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,095
<i>You're never gonna see</i>

407
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,330
<i>a four-door Korean
with air-conditioning</i>

408
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,331
and power steering

409
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,801
or a fully loaded
Black Jeep Jew.

410
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,468
[Laughs]

411
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,072
[Applause]

412
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:42,752
You know, someone very important
left me a few years ago,

413
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:49,826
and it was hell for a while,

414
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,094
but you get over it, and...

415
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,963
<i>and hopefully you do better
next time.</i>

416
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,200
[Sighs]

417
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,869
<i>That's probably not
much consolation right now.</i>

418
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,176
Oh.

419
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,478
It's okay.

420
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,334
I'm sorry.

421
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,411
Are you okay?

422
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:06,603
Hey, I have your rings!

423
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,471
[Bell ringing]

424
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:14,177
[Bell ringing]

425
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,523
Hey, wait!

426
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,917
Why...

427
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,258
Why are you doing this?

428
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Please talk to me.

429
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,434
My husband left me.

430
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,171
He said our relationship
had grown stale.

431
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,774
I thought we were happy.

432
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,247
I, uh...

433
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,715
We have a son.

434
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,288
He doesn't talk. He...

435
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,823
We don't talk.

436
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,426
He won't even know I'm gone.

437
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,596
Yes, he will.

438
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:45,001
You know, my mother died
20 years ago.

439
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,542
I miss her every day.

440
00:26:55,646 --> 00:27:00,082
She killed herself.

441
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,029
I guess that was
a pretty selfish thing to do.

442
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,898
She couldn't help it.

443
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,068
Could you please
come down with me?

444
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:27,177
That's good.

445
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,199
[Screams]

446
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,834
[Loud thud]

447
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,771
[Siren wailing]

448
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,481
[Monitor beeping]

449
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:12,955
<i>(Tanya)
I, uh, thought you might, uh,</i>

450
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,591
like to read some books.

451
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:18,161
Well, that's, uh...
that's a nice thing to do.

452
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:26,736
So, uh,
how do you know Jamie?

453
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,373
She, uh... she's been coming
to my bookstore

454
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,543
since she was
a little girl.

455
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,979
She was some kid.

456
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,915
Yeah.

457
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,793
I know you probably think
that I'm unspeakable,

458
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,362
but I have to see Jamie.
Please go.

459
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,496
Look, I have to see her.

460
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,132
<i>(Laura)
She doesn't want to see you.</i>

461
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,633
<i>(John)
Sometimes people in comas</i>

462
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,967
can hear what you're saying.

463
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,537
I thought if she could hear me,
if she could hear my voice,

464
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,372
she might want to know
how much...

465
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,275
We'll leave them for her.
Thanks very much.

466
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,210
It might make her happy.

467
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:40,042
I dreamt I fucked Homer Simpson.

468
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:59,962
Did John come?

469
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,165
No.

470
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,734
But everybody else
has been great.

471
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:08,671
Tanya's been here
a couple times,

472
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,974
and Mick.

473
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,578
I think I had a dream
about Mick.

474
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,647
So you did it with Mick
and Homer Simpson

475
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,649
at the same time?

476
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,084
That's a little freaky, Jamie.

477
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,823
I could have died.

478
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:34,130
"Dear Jamie,

479
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,600
"I just wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

480
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,235
"I'm in a hospital,

481
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,938
"so I have
a lot of time to think.

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,908
<i>"I hope
you're recovering quickly.</i>

483
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:50,246
All my best,
Jackie Smithson."

484
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,949
You look like your mother.

485
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,758
Beep!

486
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,394
<i>[John on answering machine]
Jamie, Jamie, pick up.</i>

487
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,229
You don't need to deal
with that right now.

488
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,298
Play.

489
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,433
<i>(John)
I've made a terrible mistake.</i>

490
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:12,935
We don't care.

491
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,772
Play.

492
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:19,609
<i>(John)
I saw her tonight. I knew.</i>

493
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,578
<i>I really am over her
completely.</i>

494
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,379
What do you think
of that "completely"?

495
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,914
I think he's protesting
too much.

496
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,617
He doesn't need the "really"
and the "completely."

497
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,885
Play it again.

498
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,253
<i>Beep!</i>

499
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,054
<i>(John)
I really am over her
completely.</i>

500
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,390
He's clearly not stable.

501
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,928
One minute, he's out the door;
the next, he's on his knees.

502
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:44,366
Sweetie, you've been
through so much lately.

503
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,769
Maybe you shouldn't
call him back for a while.

504
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:51,540
<i>Just wait
till you feel stronger.</i>

505
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,342
I've only known him
for two weeks,

506
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,077
not counting
the two years in college

507
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,946
I spent fantasizing about him.

508
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,281
<i>What if, all of a sudden,</i>

509
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:01,050
he really, truly,
completely decides

510
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,886
he wants to be with Martha?

511
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,757
<i>Here, here.</i>

512
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,892
Here.

513
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:10,893
There you go.

514
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:11,894
Thank you.

515
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,162
You're welcome.

516
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,398
You're better off alone
right now.

517
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,402
You don't want
another flaky boyfriend.

518
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,381
(Jamie)
This is my life.

519
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,686
I'm just a pathetic
jerk magnet.

520
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,788
Wow, you're pretty hard
on yourself.

521
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,757
I don't know.

522
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,192
Just trying
to face the facts.

523
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,375
What do you think
about celibacy?

524
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,577
I think it sucks.

525
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,212
I'm not talking about you.

526
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,616
[Laughs]

527
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:12,655
I'm thinking celibacy might be
a really good thing for me.

528
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:21,330
I just don't want to keep doing
what I've been doing.

529
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,465
It hurts too much.

530
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:35,211
So I thought maybe
if I just spent time with men

531
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,613
without the possibility
of sex.

532
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:42,118
I think
that's a beautiful idea.

533
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,454
And it doesn't have to be
for the rest of my life.

534
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,824
I'm thinking, like,
three months.

535

00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,826
That's what it looks like.

897
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,562
Where's your boyfriend?

898
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,497
I don't have a boyfriend.

899
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,233
Mick is not my boyfriend.

900
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:12,667
He's just a friend.

901
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,903
I can't believe that you're
pulling this bullshit

902
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:17,438
after all that "I'll see you
in the moonlight" bullshit.

903
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,539
You know what?

904
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,876
Just go back to Martha.

905
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,145
If you would just slow down
just for a second,

906
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,013
I'd invite you in
to meet my sister.

907
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:28,950
Your sister.

908
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,285
Yes, my sister.

909
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,352
I saw you.

910
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:32,888
You spanked your "sister"

911
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,389
after she slapped you
on the ass.

912
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,490
<i>For Christ's sake,</i>

913
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,359
we've been doing that
since we were kids.

914
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,828
I'm sure it has all sorts
of incestuous connotations,

915
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,231
but I'm not in touch
with them.

916
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,735
I feel like an idiot.

917
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,506
Uh, I'm gonna go now.

918
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,409
<i>She'd really like
to meet you.</i>

919
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,012
No, I'm really gonna go now.

920
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,184
[Applause]

921

922
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:28,343
Oh!

923
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:29,344
Good shot.

924
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:30,478
You're letting me win.

925
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,779
Absolutely not.

926
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,982
What, are you wearing
women's clothing now?

927
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:39,287
Only hats and bras.

928
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,189
No, it's, uh...

929
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,724
it's a present from my mom.

930
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,761
She hasn't been with anyone
in 20 years,

931
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,263
since my dad.

932
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,597
Were they divorced?

933
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,666
No.

934
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,835
He just got up and left
one day.

935
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:57,172
What a jerk.

936
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,373
<i>Not really.</i>

937
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,075
He was a good man,
for an Irishman.

938
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,445
<i>Never touched a drink,</i>

939
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:09,417
never said "fuck,"

940
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,687
good dad.

941
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,325
Would you mind
looking after Molly

942
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,460
for a while
while I'm gone?

943
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,563
You're going away?

944
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,831
To Dublin.
Dublin!

945
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,101
And then I'm taking my mom
to Paris.

946
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,868
<i>She's never been.</i>

947
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,271
That sounds wonderful.

948
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,207
Yeah, I'd love to take her.

949
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:05,373
Molly's having babies.

950
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,875
I think I'm gonna vomit.

951
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,214
Oh.

952
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,649
Maybe you need a doctor.

953
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:18,119
Oh, no, it's...
it's morning sickness.

954
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,221
Congratulations.

955
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,959
That's what you wanted,
right?

956
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:28,296
Well, I had some artificial
insemination fantasies,

957
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:31,299
but this one
was heterosexual penetration.

958
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,633
Oh.

959
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,170
I thought you were gay now.

960
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:39,607
I'm bisexual.
I just prefer women.

961
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,010
Wow, what are you gonna do?

962
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:45,380
Well, I'm gonna have it.

963
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,951
I'm even thinking
of getting married again.

964
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,386
With the father?

965
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,653
Mm-hmm.

966
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,756
Well, Mick's a good husband.

967
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,791
He'd make a great dad.

968
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,895
Mick?

969
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,664
Mick's the father?

970
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,866
Did you know
he was fucking Sandy?

971
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,002
No.

972
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,939
No, of course not.
I would have told you that.

973
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,442
I thought we were friends.

974
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:18,913
Friends tell each other
things like that.

975
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:50,311
You think we should tell Jamie?

976
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,415
What would we say?

977
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:57,752
That we're friends.

978
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,755
Then she might think
that we're more than friends.

979
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,657
But we're not.

980
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,359
I know, but she could think.

981
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,993
You're right.

982
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,529
You're right.

983
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,369
You're smoking now.

Hello.

992
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,088
I got back early.
What are you up to tonight?

993
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:40,194
Uh, I... have a lot of work.

994
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,964
Then I'll just stop by tomorrow

995
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,867
<i>and pick up Molly.</i>

996
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,275
I brought you a present.

997
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:02,016
My old Irish sweater
from when I was a kid.

998
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,218
No, Irish fisherman's sweater.

999
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:10,257
But non-Irish non-fishers
are permitted to wear them.

1000
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,526
You know, looks kind of big.

1001
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,094
Maybe you should just keep it.

1002
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,897
[Teakettle whistling]

1003
01:02:20,168 --> 01:02:21,402

Jamie,

1006
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,814
<i>I have something
to tell you.</i>

1007
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:35,650
I already know.

1008
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:36,917
Why didn't you tell me?

1009
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,856
Well, I only found out about it
last night.

1010
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:44,959
Why are you lying?

1011
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:47,127
I found out last week
you were getting married.

1012
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:48,496
Married?

1013
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:53,167
You're marrying Sandy.

1014
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,035
Why would I marry
a lesbian,

1015
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,137
especially one
that I've already divorced?

1016
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:59,541
Last night,
she mumbled something,

1017
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,276
but no.

1018
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:10,951
So how'd she... get pregnant?

1019
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:15,656
I went over there one night

1020
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,459
right after her girlfriend
walked out.

1021
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,461
You wanted to make her
feel better?

1022
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,996
<i>No, I wanted me
to feel better.</i>

1023
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,064
It was right after
Tanya's party.

1024
01:03:27,102 --> 01:03:28,569
So it only happened once.

1025
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:29,837
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1026
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,741
We were drunk and...

1027
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:38,278
the condom fell off inside her
right after.

1028
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,848
Well...

1030
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,320
So you happy
about being a father?

1031
01:03:47,155 --> 01:03:48,356
Yeah.

1032
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:54,729
I'm terrified.

1033
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:58,666
But, um,

1034
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,636
I'm gonna be here for this kid
no matter what.

1035
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:09,143
That's great.

1036
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,317
They don't look
like sisters.

1037
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,294
I'm thinking
about breaking my celibacy.

1038
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:31,365
With who?

1039
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,001
Mick.

1040
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:37,839
That's great.

1041
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,474
You know what's weird?

1042
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,809
If I hadn't been celibate
and gotten to know Mick,

1043
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,711
I'd probably be with John
right now,

1044
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,515
<i>even though he's really
not right for me.</i>

1045
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,717
Yeah.

1046
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,588
He's not of my world,
you know?

1047
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,255
He doesn't know Homer Simpson.

1048
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:57,958
Jamie, you've been
with a lot of guys.

1049
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,861
And I'm sure
they all knew Homer Simpson,

1050
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,297
and they were idiots.

1051
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:04,965
Are you saying
I should be with John?

1052
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,301
I didn't say that.

1053
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:17,578
Hey, you're probably making
the right choice.

1054
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,415
Mick's a goofball
just like you.

1055
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,983
[Laughs]

1056
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:26,153
Anyway, John, was, you know...

1057
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:29,790
he was your teacher, and...

1058
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:34,729
and he's kind of cerebral
like Daddy.

1059
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,297
It's probably an Oedipal thing.

1060
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:40,334
Yeah, that's your territory.

1061
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:45,039
Oh, yeah, right.

1062
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,707
Are you gonna tell John?

1063
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:50,144
It's Mick.

1064
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:57,151
Um, yup.

1065
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:01,822
Well, I saw that one coming
a mile off.

1066
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:05,392
You could be
more disappointed.

1067
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:08,463
I want you to be happy.

1068
01:06:14,803 --> 01:06:16,737
You could still be
more disappointed.

1069
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,806
I am. I'm crushed.

1070
01:06:24,345 --> 01:06:26,514
So you've got five days
of celibacy left.

1071
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,283
Uh, yeah,
midnight Friday.

1072
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,118
Any plans to celebrate?

1073
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,053
Mm-mm, not yet.

1074
01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:41,195
Would you, uh,
like to celebrate with me?

1075
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:44,298
