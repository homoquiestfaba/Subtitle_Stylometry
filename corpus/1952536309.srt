Well, first,
I'd like to thank all of our guests...

6
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,579
for joining us this evening to celebrate
our son Tristan's 25th birthday.

7
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,899
We've been blessed in being able to hold
onto him a little longer than we expected.

8
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,379
And we enjoyed every moment.

9
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,579
But as your time as an undergraduate
finally concludes...

10
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,659
and you move on to graduate school
and beyond...

11
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,459
we hope that you will carry with you
all that we have learned together...

12
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,512
and that you understand that you can
do anything that you put your mind to.

13
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,699
But more importantly, you have the
love and support of everyone in this room.

14
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,079
- Happy birthday, Tristan.
- Happy birthday, Tristan.

15
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,859
They're beautiful, aren't they?
Look at that.

16
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,059
I hope he doesn't blow this one.

17
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,979
- How are those LSATs coming?
- The LSATs on the birthday.

18
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,711
- Hey. Happy birthday, dude.
- Thanks, bro. Cheers.

19

<i>(man) It's just too easy.</i>

20
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,499

- (man #3) Do you have six cards there?</i>

21
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,471

- (man #2) Count your fucking chips.</i>

22
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,099
- Can we go now?
- Rose, baby, we're just getting started.

23
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,179
Oh! You gotta be kidding me.

24
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,659
Well, I've had enough poker for one night,
so you can find a ride home.

25
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,939
Keys?

26
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,459
Evan, you've seen the numbers.
This is a good opportunity.

27
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,219
I wholeheartedly agree with you, Ben,
but these things take time.

28
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,739
- You know what they say about Rome.
- We're not building an empire...

29
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,779
Ben, Ben, slow down. There's still
plenty of time to get all this figured out.

30
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,259
I doubt that my retirement will have
the effect that you seem to think it'll have.

31
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,459
And besides, we have
the whole weekend to talk about this.

32
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,419
So let's just
save it for Pismo. Drink?

33
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,499
- Sure.
- Yeah.

<i>(Rose) Girls, are you coming?</i>

35
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,339
I think I'm gonna stay.
I kinda wanna learn how to play.

36
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,299
No, you don't. You're coming.
You'll thank me later.

- Where are you going?
- The mall.

38
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,139
Hey, Allison, isn't this crew a little young
for you to be hanging out with?

39
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,154
You are such an asshole.

40
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,899
You guys are all assholes.
Let's go.

41
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,019
All right. Ante.

42
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,034
- Bye-bye.
- And they're gone.

43
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,190
Good to see you.

44
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,754

Take care.

45
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,379
- It's time.
- Nice.

46
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,259
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm coming with you.

47
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,819
- I don't think so.
- Come on, little guy. Let's go.

48
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,419
Oh, Jesus.
You guys are leaving, too?

49
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,579
- Yeah. And you're coming with.
- Yeah... Let me just ask the warden.

50
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,299
Don't you get some time off
for good behaviour?

51
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,952
- No, man.
- Hey, boys. Thanks for coming.

52
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,059
Sir, I wondered if I could borrow
your boys for a couple of hours...

53

of safe, responsible interaction
with the outside world.

54
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,699
What kind of interaction?

55
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,419
Sir, I'm not gonna lie to you.

56
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,539
Consumption of alcoholic beverages
is probably gonna happen.

57
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,739
But not for this guy.

58
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,754
- Dad, it's his birthday.
- Hayden, be quiet.

59
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,139
Shut up, Hayden.

60
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,757
Well, can I count on you
to make sound decisions out there?

61
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,579
Of course, Dad.

62
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,949
Well, all right. Get your friends out of here
before they wake up the neighbourhood.

63
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,419
- He's such an asshole sometimes.
- Who cares? He's let us go out tonight.

64
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,059
Buddy, you're gonna
have a good time tonight.

65
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,779

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,259
All... all right.

168
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,992
Thanks for keeping her warm
for me there, uh, Hayden Price.

169

No problem.

Javon, Antonio.
Guys, that's Tristan.

173
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,230
How are you doing, Tristan.
Nice to meet you, man.

174

- Drink?
- Whatever you got, man.

175
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,111
So, how long
have you known April for?

176
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,677
- Actually, I just met her.
- I figured as much. Not really your type.

177
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,914
It's a fucking compliment, bro. Relax.

178
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,950
All right. All right.
Well, in that case, thanks.

179
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,139
So, what happened to you, dude?
You dropped out of school or something?

180
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,179
Uh, something like that.

181
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,179
I'm actually in my last quarter now.
And then off to law school if I'm lucky.

182
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,299
Fucking law school.
Yeah, bro, that sounds real lucky.

183
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,859
That kind of reminds me...

184
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,619
I got this LSAT prep class tomorrow
morning, so I should probably go.

185

Yeah, man. LSAT prep.
Come on. Just stay for a little bit.

All right, dude, okay. Well, it's
fucking great to see you again, man.

- One more.

- See you later, bro.

- Yeah.

- Are you a friend of Hayden's?
- No, Tristan's, actually.

332
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,299
That's strange.
He's never mentioned you.

333
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,459
Well, he spoke very highly of you.

334
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,236
He clearly understated
your beauty, however.

335
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,274
- Freshening up on the classics?
- Something like that.

336
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,139
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

337
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:57,259
- I see you met Sebastian.
- Yes. Where have you been hiding him?

338
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,830
Uh, it's...

339
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,299
- Could we talk?
- Yeah.

340
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,713
- I'll be right back, babe.
- It was nice meeting you.

341
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,339
Hey, so what happened?
How did I get home last night?

342
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,539
Dude, you passed the fuck out.

343
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,339
You were mumbling some shit about
LSATs and the next thing I know, bam.

344
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,819
Me and J had to carry your ass upstairs.

345
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,899
I'm just glad that nobody woke up, man.
It could've got awkward.

346
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,499
Good thing we avoided awkwardness.

347
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,659
So did you have fun?

348
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,913
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

349
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,240
That's good.

350
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,499
So, uh, thanks for stopping by.

351
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,739
Hey, man, we're at the house tonight.
Roll through.

352
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,139
Uh, you know, actually,
I have plans with Brooke tonight.

353
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,518
So bring her by.
You can introduce her to April.

354
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,379
- Yeah, right.
- Bye.

355
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,518
Later.

356
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,099
I miss this.

357
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,219
Yeah, me too.

358
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,019
Don't you wish
it could be like this every night?

359
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,059
- Of course.
- Really?

360
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,859
<i>- Absolutely.

361

Good.

362
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,339
We're taking the body boards out
this week. You down?

363
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,659
- I can't. I gotta practise.
- Man, he'd rather play with his balls.

364

<i>- You'd rather play with them, too.
- (girl) Doesn't it ever get old?</i>

- (girl) I didn't see you in class.</i>

366
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,939
I wasn't feeling well.
I just chilled.

367

- What's up?
- We missed you the other night.

371
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,499
Yeah, boyfriend duty. So what brings you
to this neck of the urban wasteland?

372
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,339
- I've got a gift for you.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

Well, it's not here so... come on.

Come on, man.
Just get in.

All right.

376
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,259
So where are we going?

377
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,099
Are you gonna shoot me or what?

378
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,099
- You got my back, man?
- Do I have your back?

379
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,910
Yeah, dawg, I got your back.

380
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,819
- Get out.
- Are you serious?

381
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,659
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Jesus, Sebastian. I was just kidding.

382
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,979
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean anything by it.

383
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,299
Yeah, I have your back.

384
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,155
You can trust me.

385
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,899
- What are you giving me this for?
- It's like I said before, you never know.

386
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,019
Plus, I need you
to back me up on something.

387
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,659
I gotta go to this meeting tonight
and I can't take Javon to it.

388
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,779
- Why not?
- Look, it's fucking complicated, okay?

389
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,059
I don't wanna be
in this fucking business any more.

390
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,579
So I need to just
back me the fuck up on this, okay?

391
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,312
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, whatever you need.

392
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,357
Good.

393
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,219
So what am I supposed to do with this?
Put it in my pants or in the back?

394
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,019
Do whatever the fuck you want.
They'll take it anyway.

395
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,699
- Well, then why am I carrying it?
- Better that than your dick in your hand.

396
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,379
All you gotta do is walk in, sit down, and
act like you're not gonna piss your pants.

397
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,758
- Are you ready?
- No.

398
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,998
Hope you don't mind, gents.
Gotta check you for weapons.

399
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,915
Got company.

400

Well, if it ain't the mother

Whatever.

403

Mr Black,

404
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,979
Keep your hair on, Sebastian.

405
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,277
We're all safe here.

- Horse?
- Huh?

407
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,194
Why the long face?
Can I get you a drink?

408
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,317
No, thanks.
I'm, uh... I'm good.

00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,670
Now... down to business.

410
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,259
I heard about your problem
the other day with them boys in the club.

411
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,179
I know the type.

412
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,019
Maybe bought an ounce off you,
spunked it up the wall,

413
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,059
then come back to you
moaning about the quality.

414
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,632
- Don't sweat your bollocks about it.
- Thanks.

415
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,589
We've had a little organisational shuffle.

416
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,019
Dyson here, he's gonna look after
operations in Southern California.

417
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,659
You report to him,
he reports to me...

418
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,939
and we're one big happy family.

419

With all due respect...

420
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,355
With all due respect,
you should nod and say thank you.

421
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,779
- So where's this coming from?
- It's coming from me...

422
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,659
straight back to you.

423

498
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,428
Come on!

499
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,436
Do it!

500
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,311
He's a smart kid.

501
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,836
Why don't you go wait in the car?

502
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,229
You ain't that motherfucking bright,
though, huh?

503
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,619
<i>(Javon laughs)</i>

504
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,979
What the fuck are you doing in the car,
man? You missed all the shit.

505
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,099
Holy shit, you pussy.

506
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,019
Oh, my God.
I just got my dick sucked.

507
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,919
Keep it close.

508
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,115
<i>(mockingly) "Don't kill me"!</i>

509
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,219
Hey, T, hold up.
They teach you that shit in law school?

510
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,837
Na, probably not.

511
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,419
Anyway, you missed the best part, man.

512
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,379
Those girls upstairs, they were
a little timid at the beginning...

513
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,019
but, you know,
once I got them in the mood...

514
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,557
Mm.
Those girls like to fuck.

515
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,979
Hey, T.

516
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,994
Shh.
Don't wake up your parents.

517
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,916
Hey, Dad.

518
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,596
You still up?

519
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,789
Please tell me that we're not
right back here again.

520
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,836
After all the hard work that I've done.

521
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:21,032
Locked up or cut off.

522
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,716
Those are my choices.

523
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,819
- Good work.
- I have tried to give you the best life.

524
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,819
What kind of life is that, Dad?

525
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,659
Huh?

526
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,379
I mean, I'm so claustrophobic in here,
I can't breathe.

527
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,556
- I'm 25 years old, for Christ's sake!
- Then fucking act like it.

528
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,179
- What up, T?
- Hey, what's up?

529
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,859
What's going on, man?
You look like shit. Get yourself together.

530
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,078
Thanks.

531
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,553
Don't fuck up.

532
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,299
- Hey.
- Hey.

533
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,756
How you doing?

534
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,156
I'm good.

535
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,619
Hey.

536
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,619
I know you.
Sebastian, right?

537
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,819
- Yeah. Good memory.
- What are you doing on this side of town?

538
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,619
I just had some business to take care of
and I was just killing some time.

539
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,499
Where are you headed?
Want me to walk you to class?

540
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,939
Yeah, sure.

541
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,796
- Did you finish that book yet?
- Yeah, I just did.

542
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:42,139
Well I liked the book, I just... I don't know
I didn't really like the ending.

543
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,379
I just thought that Mondego,
he got off so easy.

544
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,739
If I was Dantès,
I would've made him suffer.

545
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,357
Well, he did kill him.
What could be worse than that?

546
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,112
Well, there are worse things than death.

547
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:08,240
Sebastian, what happened to Tristan
in his freshman year?

548
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,779
I don't really know
any of his friends from back then...

549
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,779
except for you, I guess.

550
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,499
You know, Tristan will tell you
when the time is right.

551
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,059
I don't know why, but it seems like
he just looks right through me.

552
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,539
I know what that's like, though.
I mean, that's how my father was.

553
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,259
Me, too.

554
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,115
Everything's gonna be okay, Brooke.

555
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,712
Trust me.

556
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,390
- I should go.
- Okay.

557
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,819
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, it was good to see you.

558
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,379
Actually, I might even see you
this evening.

559
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,659
The Prices invited me over
to their party.

560
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,499
I'm gonna see if I can
clear a few things and try to stop by.

561
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,877
See you tonight.

562
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,219
- You okay?
- Yeah.

563
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,979
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

564
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,074
<i>(phone rings)</i>

565
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,779
Hello?

566
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,979
Yo, T-bag.

567
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,579
Holy shit, man. Look, you've got coke all
over your fucking nose like a crackhead.

568
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,419
Yeah, get it up.
You brother wants to talk to you.

569
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,059
- H-Hayden?
- Yeah, H-Hayden.

570
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,139
- Where?
- He's outside.

571
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:56,395
Doesn't wanna come in. Something about
being a little bitch or something.

572
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,792
Hey, bro.

573
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,699
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

574
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,619
Look, man, don't you think
it's about time to head home?

575
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,859
Mom and Dad
are getting pretty worried about you.

576
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,750
Why don't they just
worry about their own shit for once?

577
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,219
Look at you, man.
This is bullshit.

578
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,139
Just go home,
get you cleaned up, take a breather.

579
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,979
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Tris, everything's in the balance for you.

580
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,979
You're fucking up your LSATs,
cheating on Brooke.

581
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,859
I... I am not cheating on Brooke.

582
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,139
Then go back to her, Tris.

583
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,499
- Don't make me tell her.
- You're not gonna fucking tell her shit!

584
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,099
Then pull your head out of your ass, man.
You're fucking it all up!

585
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,539
Come on.
I'm saying this cos I love you, bro.

586
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,508
It kills me to see you like this, man.

587
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,314
Maybe Dad was right about you.

588
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,459
Hayden.

589
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,952
- What the fuck you doing out here?
- Hayden!

590
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,792
<i>(no sound)</i>

591
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,019
I feel sorry for you, man. That's it.

592
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,099
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

593
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,239
I saw Sebastian today on campus.

594
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,876
He was with your fiancée.

595
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,299
Fuck you, Hayden!

596
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,756
Fuck you!

597
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,899
He has never acted like this before.
I mean...

598
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:04,019
Even in college. He partied and did his
thing, but... He's out of control, you know?

599
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,239
Sebastian has that effect on people.

600
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,275
Why do you stay?

601
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,019
Hey.
Where are we going?

602
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:20,559
I just thought we needed
a little change of scenery, that's all.

603
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:30,915
Here.
You left this on the couch.

604
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,779
You're a sweet guy, Hayden.

605
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,419
Oh, that's great.
Exactly what I want to hear.

606
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,939
I mean that in a good way,
a really good way.

607
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,379
And what way is that?

608
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,139
In a way that part of me wants to
tell you to turn around right now...

609
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,995
run away, and never look back.

610
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,179
And the other part?

611
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,830
Wants to run away with you.

612
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,219
Forget about her. Come on.

613
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,632
I'm here now.
Come on.

614
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,595
Here.

615
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,751
Give me that.

616
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,836
Lie down, relax.

617
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,269
I don't know
what's happening any more.

618
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,634

- Shh.

I know when my baby's in love.
It's nice.

626
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,659
The question I have for you is,
what are you gonna do?

627
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,699
Pluck her out of this god-awful existence
and bring her home to your house?

628
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:15,699
I mean, what? That would be nice,
though, wouldn't it, baby? Huh?

629
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,739
What a dream that would be
to go somewhere...

630
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,619
where no one knows
where you came from, hm?

631
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:23,499
Hm.

632
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,357
Where no one knew what a fucking
wretched, used-up piece of shit you are.

633
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,299
You're a fucking sick fuck,
you know that?

634
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,899
- Stop it.
- You shut the fuck up.

<i>(sobs)</i>

636
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:29,819
You fuck. See, the mistake you made
was assuming that you had any rights.

637
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,419
Maybe at home,
when you have Mommy and Daddy...

638
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:37,939
you can take whatever the fuck you want.
Out here you're out of your environment.

639
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,579
There are consequences to pay
for your actions.

640
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,579
Now, we started a business together...

641
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,859
so what's mine is theirs,
and what's theirs is mine.

642
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,139
You see the fish on the floor? Mine.

643
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,219
All the other girls
around the house, mine.

01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:57,459
Your little stupid bitch-ass brother,
that little fucking shithead is mine.

645

And if I wanted to own...
Shut the fuck up!

646
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:05,311
And if I wanted to own you, you'd be mine.
But frankly, I don't fucking like you.

you don't want to get out of here, do you?
A walk, a drive or something?

01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,699
You wipe out one of my boys...

838
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,659
you mess up his bedroom...

839
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:23,674
and you steal my bread and honey.

840
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,074
- Your what?
- Money, honey.

841
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:32,059
Then you have the bollocks
to walk in here...

842
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:37,419
and ask me for a favour! You've got two
seconds to tell me what's on your mind.

843
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:41,390
I need you to help me
kill Sebastian Cole.

844
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,356
Why didn't you just say so?

845
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,713
He's trying to frame me.

846
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:56,150
- I know.
- Then why are you threatening to kill me?

847
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:59,539
Everybody needs a hobby.

848
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,499
What about you take my boys
and you go and bury this fucker?

849
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,718
Let me tell you this.

850
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,579
You fuck this up and you're dead.

851
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,539
If the boys think you're gonna
fuck this up, you're dead.

852
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:19,875
In fact, my friend, it's gonna be
very hard for you to stay alive.

853
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,833
- Got it.
- Now...

854
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,596
fuck off.

855
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,919
Clear this up.

856
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:47,713
To new beginnings.

857
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:53,459
Remember you asked me what happened
to Tristan, freshman year UCLA?

858
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:57,157
- It doesn't matter now.
- No, you should know.

859
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,619
He was dating this girl.

860
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,539
Jaime Pierson.

861
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:06,219
She was a party girl, wild,
the type of girl that would do anything.

862
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:12,590
Tristan threw one of his signature bashes
and Jaime swallowed a speedball.

863
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:16,590
OD'd, died right on the living room floor.

864
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,979
Oh, my God.

865
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:24,439
I'm sorry.
I didn't really mean to kill the mood.

866
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:29,154
- Quit touching me.
- Shut the fuck up.

867
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,712
Where's Sebastian?

868
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,756
<i>(no sound)</i>

869
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,459
<i>(gasps)</i>

870
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:41,059
You're gonna be okay, alright?
I'm gonna get you out of here.

871
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,979
- You're going to be all right.
- I'm sorry.

872
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,436
<i>(sobs, groans)</i>

873
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:53,419
<i>- Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
- (whispers) They're at the marina.</i>

874
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:56,480
- What?
- They're at the marina.

875
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,339
Jesus Christ.

876
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:08,796
<i>(sobs)</i>

877
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,916
Oh, God.

878
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:38,299
Do you think that he did
what they say he did?

879
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,579
I hope not. I mean,
it's one thing to kill a drug dealer...

880
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:46,039
- but what he did to those girls...
- What girls?

881
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,379
They found the murder weapon
in his glove compartment.

882
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,155
I thought that the gun
was in his hand.

883
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:07,259
Why don't we take the boat for a spin?
I'll teach you to drive it.

884
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:10,939
- No, I should be going.
- It'll be fun. I'll have you home by dinner.

885
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:15,099
No, I... I mean, this has been
really great, but I should really go, okay?

886
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,556
Um, no, not okay, actually.

887
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:24,499
- Just get back inside now.
- Stop it, you're scaring me.

888
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,819
<i>- You know what? Bitch.
- (gasps)</i>

889
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:29,629
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?!

890
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,838
<i>(Brooke screams)</i>

891
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,871
<i>(Tristan) Brooke?</i>

892
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:19,469
Why are you doing this?

893
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:25,110
<i>(groans)</i>

894
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,995
Hey, Brooke.

895
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,259
Your boyfriend's here.

896
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,876
Leave her alone!

897
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,349
Move! Get the fuck up.
Come on!

898
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,719
<i>(groans)</i>

899
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,059
Who's gonna fucking bail
you out now, Tristan? Huh?

900
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,710
<i>(groans)</i>

901
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,819
Stop!

902
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:18,059
Why are you doing this?

903
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,699
Your daddy and his friends
had me put away for five fucking years.

904
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,779
<i>(screams)</i>

905
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,316
You son of a bitch!

906
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,316
What are you gonna do?

907
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,638
People like you
don't have the fucking balls.

908
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,739
<i>(shouting)</i>

909
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:04,037
Fuck you!

910
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,676
<i>(cocks gun)</i>

911
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:12,516
<i>(man) All clear.</i>

912
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:16,470
There's no one here, boss.

913
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,007
Someone's playing fucking
games with me.
