- [Michael] Lula loves her syrup.
- [Debbie] You have enough syrup.

00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,953
[Tim] Mrs. Butterworths
isn't a squirt bottle.

9
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,994
lt's no big deal. You've had enough.

10
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,361
- Mom, these aren't brown enough.
- Do you want me to burn them?

11
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,798
No, but l just want them more brown.

12
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,336
Mikey, Mom's not a short order cook.

13
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,893
Eat up now.

14
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,202
[Natalie] Double knots?
We never did double knots.

15
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,245
- [Nick] Sweetie, l can't get it.
- Don't use a fork.

16
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,008
No bubbles at the table.
Eat your breakfast first.

17
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,983
She's right, you know,
my eggs taste like bubbles now.

18
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,817
- Hurry up, honey, you'll be late.
- [Tim] All right.

19
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,330
The van needs an inspection sticker.
Good luck.

20
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,363
Alrighty.

21
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,997
What's this?
Look who's hiding.

22
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,510
Mr. Dino...
and another weird stowaway.

23
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,671
Okay, Nathan, no cereal in my thingie.

24
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,476
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, honey.

25
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,743
Nathan!

26
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,878
- What's that?
- What?

27
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,113
That.

28
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,757
Maple syrup.

29
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:52,597
Mmm, man! Can you believe
that comes from a tree?

30
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,360
Don't taste my pants.

31
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,197
l can't taste your pants?

32
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,032
Ever.

33
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,401
- Ever?
- No.

34
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,736
Well, don't spill maple syrup on them.

35
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,538
Just because it's there
doesn't mean you have to taste it.

36
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,704
- l like maple syrup.
- Not from my pants.

37
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,212
l love it.

38
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,380
How about this:
What if you had, like, an inkpad...

39
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,758
only instead of ink,
it was soaked in maple syrup.

40
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,295
Or peppermint.
Any flavor you wanted.

41
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:30,227
- And you just open up your little pad.
- Right.

42
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,864
And you press your finger on it
and then you taste your finger.

43
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,206
Peppermint. Any time of day.
Or cherry.

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,213
[Tim] Wouldn't the pad get disgusting
after awhile?

45
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,771
[Nick] Disgusting how?

46
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,750
l don't know. You keep touching it
with your filthy fingers.

47
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,584
Couple of days that flavor pad's like
some mattress you find at the dump.

48
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,756
You're right. lt's no good.

49
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,620
[knocking]

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,794
[Nick] Tim.

51
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,360
- Did you get your performance chart?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,271
Well, look at mine. l don't get it.

53
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,400
Good. Fair. Fair. Good.

54
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,206
Then it falls into the red
in the focus department.

55
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,010
Well, you know, Nick, that's because
you're a dreamer. You know?

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,179
- l'm not a dreamer.
- You're not the most focused person.

57
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,846
You're a dreamer.

58
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,255
Yeah. l'm a dreamer?

59
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,193
Hey, you want to feel something?
Come here.

60
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,287
Sit in this chair. Come here.

61
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,298
Okay.

62
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,799
Check this out.

63
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,859
Whoa.

64
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,463
- Sit back.
- Oh, this is some chair!

65
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,940
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,533
Feel this.

67
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,379
What is that?

68
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,007
- Lumbar support.
- That is good.

69
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,281
- lt's made especially for your spine.
- l like it.

70
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,255
Comes with the office.
And the promotion.

71
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,554
- Right.
- Thinking of buying a swimming pool?

72
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,355
- What, are you kidding?
- l am.

73
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,363
- Thinking bean-shaped.
- [grunts]

74
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,832
Expensive. Bean-shaped?

75
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,095
[whistling]

76
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,995
Take a look at my performance chart.

77
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,839
Look at your focus. lt's way up there.
lt's in the yellow.

78
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,971
l'm telling you, you get your focus
even into the orange, just the orange...

79
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,312
l guarantee you can have
a chair like that.

80
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,249
- Really?
- And an office like this.

81
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,879
And a piano-shaped pool
if that's what you want.

82
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,753
lt's all there for you.
All you got to do is focus.

83
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,451
Just work a little bit harder.

84
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,360
You can get bumped up to sandpaper
with me and the world opens up.

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,627
You know what, man?
You could really sack out in this thing.

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,101
l'm telling you, your numbers
aren't that bad. lt's just focus.

87
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,504
lf you put together everything else, you
got a really strong thing going on...

- l got to get back to work.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,915
- Good talk.
- Yeah, good talk.

93
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,185
- Remember what l said.
- Focus.

94
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,588
- Just get into orange.
- That's all l need.

95
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,058
Don't even worry about yellow,
just orange.

96

[whistle blows]

97
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,568
[Nick] Do you ever just watch your hand?

98
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,036
[Tim] No.

99
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,300
l was just looking at my hand today.

100
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,143
lt was like a separate thing.

101
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,473
lt was...

102
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,280
picking up papers.

103
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,513
lt tapped on my desk.
lt sat in my lap.

104
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,088
- lt's like...
- Sorry.

105
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,454
lt's like a...

106
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,186
lt's like a sidekick.

107
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,423
My little ugly sidekick.
lt was very odd.

108
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,641
Eww.

109
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,878
- [Nick] Oh, oh!
- [Tim] What?

110
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,547
- [Nick] Oh!
- [Tim] What?!

111
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,146
[Nick] How about this?

112
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:15,251
A spray can, see?
And you spray it on dog poo...

113
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,161
and the poo disappears.

114
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,096
- Disappears?
- Yes!

115
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,134
Where does it go?

116
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,192
Who knows? But the thing is...

117
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,262
you come up with something
that gets rid of dog turds,

118
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,673
you are home free, my friend.
Home free.

122
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,393
Nothing.

123
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,124
Liposuction.

124
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,266
You mean, where they suck the fat out?

125
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,430
There's a thing about it in here.

126
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,134
You're fine. You don't need
to get fat sucked out.

127
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,508
- lf we had a little extra money...
- We don't have extra money.

128
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,911
- We have a little.
- Not to get fat sucked out.

Hello?

- Timmy. Timmy, check this out.
- What?

132
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,190
You know that invention of mine
that makes turds disappear?

[sighing]

134
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,291
l got a name for it.

135
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,421
Vapoorize.

136
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,901
Just like vaporize only you add an ''o''
so you got ''poo'' right in the middle.

137
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,334
Yeah, l get it.

138
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,703
Do you see how perfect it is?
Maybe even underline the poo.

139
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,401
Va-poo-rize.

140
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,375
- All right.
- Vapoorize.

141
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,071
Goodbye.

142
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,909
- Nick?
- Mmm-hmm.

143
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,313
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

144
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,582
Vapoorize.

145
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,256
[announcer] Next up, ladies
and gentlemen, Nathan Vanderpark.

146
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,921

- [Nick] All right.

147
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,295
- [cheering, clapping]
- Here we go, Nathan. Here we go.

148
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,065
- [woman] Almost.
- [Nick] All right.

149
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,072
- Nice try.
- [Nick] All right, Nathan, let's...

150
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,505
[Nick] Close one.

151
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,544
Oh! Come... all right.

152
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,273
[Nick] That's enough. Hey!

153
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,144
[Natalie] Almost.

154
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,343
- We'll get them next time, no problem.
- [Natalie] Good job.

155
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,477
You know Dimitriov in research?

156
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,852
- Dimitriov?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:28,326
- Kind of big beard? Kind of strange?
- No.

158
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,862
- l told him about my invention.
- What invention?

159
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,329
Vapoorize!

160
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,525
Nick, you got a cute name, that's it.

161
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,967
lt's not an invention. lt's an idea.
lt's nothing.

162
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,029
Not according to Dimitriov.
He thinks l'm really on to something.

164
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,089

- [Natalie] Good stuff.

165
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,320
- [Nick] Good job.
- [Natalie] Good stuff.

166
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,297
You know what? l love this tent.
There's not one bug.

167
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,696
Guess what?

168
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,395
l went over to Dimitriov's
a couple nights ago.

169
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,460
We ran some experiments in his sink.

170
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,268
- He's having a ball with this thing.
- What thing?

171
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,332
You didn't tell Debbie
about my invention?

172
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,379
No, sorry, l didn't.
Go ahead. This is great.

173
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,108
Check it out.
lt's a spray can, okay?

174
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,116
And you spray it on dog poo...

175
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,948
and the poo disappears.

176
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,457
That is an awesome invention.
l mean, we could sure use it.

177
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,518
lt's not an invention. lt's nothing.
l mean, how does it work?

178
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:40,087
lt's a spray can and you spray it on.

179
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,361
- Exactly.
- Right?

180
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,562
Yeah, l know.
But what makes it disappear?

181
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,332
Things don't just disappear.

182
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,135
l don't know, honey.
How does anything work?

183
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,473
How does electricity work?
l think it's a great idea.

184
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,105
So do l. l think it's really exciting.

185
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,206
- [Tim laughs]
- You're nuts.

186
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,716
Dessert, everybody?

187
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,150
- l'm nuts. l'm crazy.
- You're crazy!

188
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,280
Hey, l have an invention.
Honey, l have an invention.

189
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,258
lt's this button you press and
you sprout wings and you can fly.

190
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,888
You can fly into outer space,
to the moon, to Jupiter if you like.

191
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,233
[low chattering]

192
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,330
[whispering] He's doing so well.

193
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,568
[Tim] He's not doing anything.

194
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:27,100
- Does he have any lines?
- No, honey, he's a tree.

195
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,438
Three months of rehearsal.

196
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,681
Dimitriov wants to know
if l want to take it to the next level.

197
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,884
Four thousand bucks.
You want to go in with me, 50l50?

198
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,622
[chuckling] l pray to God
you're kidding.

199
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,425
- Your invention?
- Yeah.

200
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,594
We've been working with dry ice.
We've got something amazing.

201
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,930
Nick, forget it.

202
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,599
No, wait a minute. $2,000.
We have that in our savings.

203
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,868
[Debbie] Who knows?

204
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,105
Shit doesn't just disappear.

205
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,874
lt has to go somewhere.

206
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,907
And it's not an invention, it's an idea.
lt's a pie in the sky idea.

207
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,181
And l'll tell you,
as your best friend...

208
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,691
l think you should
just pull out right now.

209
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,556
Don't waste your money.
You're gonna regret it.

210
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,061
''lt's pie in the sky.''

211
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,427
- [screaming]
- [gasping]

212
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:23,161
Where are the kids?
What's happening?

213
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,135
Honey?

214
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,798
[Natalie] l have champagne glasses, too.

215
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,343
[Nick] All right!

216
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,878
What's happening?

217
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,712
[Nick] Okay, let me get it for you.
l'll do everything.

218
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,742
You just stay there and just relax
and get ready for the big stuff.

219
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,756
- [Nick] We got it.
- [Natalie giggling]

220
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,189
- Exciting.
- Watch this.

221
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,989
[Nick] l'm so glad you guys are here!
This is Dimitriov.

222
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,792
- Meet our best friends in the universe.
- How do you do?

223
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,629
Give Tim the flash, Big D.

224
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,430
Okay. Here, take it.

225
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,663
[Nick] Goggles.

226
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,273
Shine it right on her, buddy boy.

227
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,968
''Her''?

228
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,851
[whooping, screaming]

229
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,690
[cheering continues]

230
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,323
- You told me it would work and it did!
- [Natalie] Did you see that?!

231
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,527
[Nick] lt works.
lt works like a charm.

232
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,035
Did you guys see that?

233
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,170
[Nick] Get a camera.
There's nothing to shoot!

234
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:46,082
Spray some on my butt
because l shat my pants. Yeah!

235
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,951
We are going to be so rich, Dimitriov!

236
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,183
[Nick] Vapoorize!

237
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,390
[Natalie] God, we are going
to be so rich!

238
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,835
No matter what kind of dog you have,
let's face it,

239
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,770
they all gotta do their ''business.''

240
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,671
Vapoorize!

241
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,073
That's right!

242
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,873
[Nick] One spray: Problem solved.

243
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,675
ls this some kind of video trick?

244
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,045
No.

245
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,017
lt's the miracle spray.
One spray and doggy doo disappears.

246
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,077
No fuss, no muss, no tools,
no robot arm...

247
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,316
''How do l work it? l don't know!''

248
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,416
- Too good to be true?
- No!

249
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,723
Vapoorize: Because life is tough enough.

250
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,463
[announcer] Now at stores everywhere.

251
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:31,724
[announcer] Now at stores everywhere.

252
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,129
~ [piano, offbeat drumming]

253
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,626
[cheering]

254
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,803
[speaking in Spanish]

255
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,303
Now's a good time
to break the big news.

256
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:27,308
l have decided to run for Congress.

257
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,785
Congress.

258
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,153
No, l'm serious.

259
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,684
Yeah. l mean, not the big Congress,
of course, the little one.

260
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,663
- ''The little one.''
- ''The little one?''

261
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,566
Yeah. Actually, it might be
the state senate. l can't remember.

262
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,103
Anyway, l'm super excited...

263
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,799
because we are so lucky...

264
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,207
and we have so, so, so much.

265
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,768
And l feel like
we should give something back.

266
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,714
So, l've decided
l'm going to run for Congress

267
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,081
or state senate or whatever.

268
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,179
And my main platform...

269
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,281
is going to be...

270
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,555
the environment.

271
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,992
State senate.

272
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,830
Environment, like the whole environment?

273
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:21,601
Yeah. l believe in all environments
and l'm going to say it.

274
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,867
And now for dessert.

275
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,003
Flan!

276
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,708
- Flan! Oh, boy!
- Whoo!

277
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,844
- Come on, kids, flan time!
- Get down here, the flan's here!

278
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,911
[Natalie] Flan, kids! Flan!

279
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,581
l love flan. Do you?

280
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,919
What is flan?

281
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,085
My God, you're in for such a treat.

282
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,221
- You don't know flan?
- Eat your flan, buddy. Kids, flan!

283
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,528
- Guys, flan's on the table!
- Flan!

284
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,862
Flan! Flan!

285
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,530
Flan! Yay, flan! Flan!

286
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,402
What's flan?

287
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,272
''Jasper and Amos
shine the flashlight into the hole.

288
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,871
''Staring up at them, tied and gagged,
was Louie the Grouch.''

289
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,382
lt's getting exciting, isn't it?

290
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,511
Boy, that flan was good.

291
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,145
l wish we had flan.

292
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,287
Dad?

293
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,025
Yeah?

294
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,466
Why are we getting the little,
itty-bitty pool?

295
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,002
lt's not a little itty-bitty.

296
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,972
The square one's little itty-bitty.
We're getting the bean-shaped model.

297
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,872
A little itty-bitty bean.

298
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,141
lt's not a little, itty-bitty bean.
lt's an average-sized bean, Mikey.

299
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,681
And l got news for you.

300
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,809
There are kids in the world
who'd walk 50 miles through quicksand

301
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,548
just to stick a toe in your pool.

302
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,420
And l got news for you about beans too.

303
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,394
Some kids'd eat beans because they've
had nothing to eat their whole life,

304
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,453
but leaves and bark and roots.

305
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,592
And l guarantee you, none of them has
ever heard of your big, show-off flan,

306
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:01,662
or flan or whatever you want to call it
that you got to have every night.

307
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,309
Two thousand dollars.
That's all it would've taken.

308
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,715
- lt's okay, honey.
- Dad's just having a meltdown.

309
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,049
Good night. Sleep tight.

310
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:16,822
- l don't like English muffins.
- Eat your cereal.

311
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,154
- l don't like English muffins.
- Eat your cereal.

312
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,784
- Try different breakfast foods.
- l like pancakes.

313
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,658
- Tomorrow we'll have pancakes.
- Fine.

314
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,926
l don't want any more cereal.

315
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,064
Eat up, otherwise you don't
get to play with Corky, okay?

316
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,608
- What?
- Nothing.

317
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,313
Why are you always asking ''what''?

318
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,716
- l'm not always asking ''what.''
- Yes, you are.

319
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,344
lt's true, Dad, you are.

320
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,889
Well, because l know there's something.

321
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:56,394
- And you know exactly what it is.
- Then why do you always say ''nothing''?

322
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,861
- Corky!
- [Debbie] Hold Lula's hand, honey.

323
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,796
[Tim groans]

324
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,365
- [Mikey] Corky!
- [nickering]

325
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,027
So beautiful.

326
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,504
[Mikey] Such a great horse, Corky.

327
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,667
[Mikey] Who's a good boy?

328
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,838
Corky's a sweet and gentle horse
and me and the kids love him.

329
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,973
Corky happens to shit
the size of a breadbasket

330
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,076
in our yard every day
when he comes to visit.

331
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,586
What are you doing?

332
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,256
Nothing. Nothing at all.

333
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:12,133
l'm just throwing away some more
completely useless inventions.

334
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,706
For chrissakes, Debbie, light?
Light?! Come on!

335
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,073
Come on! This was shit.

336
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:23,080
You think Edison would've looked up
from his workbench at some shit spray?

337
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,082
Yes. Yes, l do.

338
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,551
Because, you see, a good invention
is a good invention!

339
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,487
l got news for you, sister.
Edison ain't looking up.

340
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,889
Sister. Sister?!

341
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,325
l'm calling you sister.

342
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,989
You should be so lucky
to be my sister.

343
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,895
She knows what she's talking about.

344
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,797
Windtalker, or whatever her name is.

345
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,362
- Do not call her that. lt's Windsong.
- Windsong. My mistake. Windsong.

346
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:47,873
Knockety, knockety.
A-knock, knock, knock.

347
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,307
Knockety, knockety.
A-knock, knock, knock.

348
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,435
How's everybody doing?

349
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,578
What a day, right?

350
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,415
My God! Can you believe
the coffee that makes?

351
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,217
l knew you'd love it.
Let's go, tiger.

352
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,691
[gasping, cooing]

353
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,957
Look who's here, will you please?

354
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,928
Look who's here. lt's okay, poopie.

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,128
Have you been stealing apples again,
you little rascal?

356
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,604
Listen, and l want you to be honest,
has Corky become a nuisance?

357
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,004
- No.
- Not one bit.

358
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,270
Natalie says, ''Keep the corral closed.''

359
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,677
But Corky's so crazy about your apples,
l don't know what to do.

360
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,079
No more apples for you.
No more apples...

361
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,108
l can't stop him. He loves your apples.
Are you sure he's not a problem?

362
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,485
- Positive.
- You guys are so fantastic.

363
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,425
Well, my buddy boy,
let's go shoot us some golf.

364
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:40,857
Well, my buddy boy,
let's go shoot us some golf.

365
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,941
l got something for you.
l'll be right back.

366
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,604
- Nick, no. Please.
- Yes. You'll love it.

367
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,046
You don't have to get me anything else.

368
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,489
[Nick] When l hit it big,

369
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,119
everyone said l should buy a house
in Beverly Hills, Bel Air or Malibu.

370
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,993
''Why you spending money
on a mansion in the Valley?''

371
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,195
But l love my neighborhood, and being
across the street from my best friend.

372
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,238
Do you see how it moves in the wind?
That's what l love.

373
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,503
lt flaps different than cheaper fabric.
Do you notice that?

374
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,908
- Yeah.
- And it makes you feel better.

375
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:40,850
Nice fabric makes you feel better!
lt's mind-blowing, isn't it?

376
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,251
Nick, you buy us too much.

377
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:47,758
Too much?! You're my best friend.
Nice things make life nicer.

378
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,097
All right, let's take another look
at that follow-through.

379
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,034
l want the head down.

380
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,771
That is nice, Nicky.

381
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,865
- Right?
- Very nice.

382
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,638
God Almighty, Mr. Dingman.

383
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,407
Nick? Can l talk to you for a second?

384
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,641
Just take a second.

385
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,279
Can't it just be us?
You and me playing golf?

386
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,381
lt's just, this is costing a fortune.

387
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,155
Cut it out with this money thing.
lt means nothing to me.

388
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,490
Let's just enjoy it.

389
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,231
Why can't you come with us?

390
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,131
Because Daddy has to go to work.

391
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,636
You'll have a great time
at Aunt Nancy's.

392
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,571
Aunt Windsong, and you know that.

393
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,501
lt's Aunt Windsong now.

394
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,249
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Really. Why do this?

395
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,221
Because l have to do this.
We have to do this.

396
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,257
Something has to change.

397
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,317
l can't look at you,
l can't look across the street.

398
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,658
l'm running out of places to look.

399
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,489
[whispering] The pool people
come tomorrow.

400
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,682
[Nathan] Just wait and see this, Dad.

402
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,811
Whoa! You the man.

403
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,686
- [Nick] You're the man.
- Yeah!

404

00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,051
Hey, Timmy, check this out!

407
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,526
Yeah!

408
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,995
Yah! Yah!

409
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,726
[high-pitched whinny]

410
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,129
Yah!

411
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,568
[man] Mr. Dingman!

412
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,441
Mr. Parmenter wants to see you!
Section 1 1 !

413
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,516
You wanted to see me?

414
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,643
[shouting] You all right?

415
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,777
What?

416
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,151
[shouting] You seem distracted!

417
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,421
- What?
- Come on!

418
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,551
[Parmenter] Your performance chart's
pretty good until here.

419
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,961
And then your focus
nosedives into the red.

420
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,794
You see?

421
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:46,132
Now, is there anything that happened
around here...

422
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,301
you might like to talk about?

423
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,501
No.

424
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,737
- You sure?
- Yeah. No.

425
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,574
Any reason?

426
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,582
Reason? No, l can't think of...

427
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,313
Any reason at all?

428
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:07,415
No. No reason. No.
l mean, nothing l can think of.

429
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,357
l mean...

430
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:13,591
you know, other than every day
l get into my little shit-box car

431
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,260
and there he is,
with the wind in his hair...

432
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,803
on his great big shiny horse.

433
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:24,399
And l drive off to do what?
To make sandpaper.

434
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,506
To make paper with sand on it.

435
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,674
l'd love to see you try to turn your
weasely little mouth into a fake smile,

436
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,687
day after day after day...

437
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,656
while waving toodly-fucking-do
to your best friend,

438
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:43,353
who's rearing up on a big white horse
like he's the Lone Ranger.

439
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,919
Then l'd like to see
your performance chart,

440
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,830
you beady-eyed
little shrimp-boat bastard!

441
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,095
[voice cracks] ls that a reason?

442
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,141

~ [Envy reprise]

444
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,360
Hi.

445
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:27,736
l don't really drink,
but my family just left me

446
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,934
and l got fired and l want a drink.

447
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,379
So, if you could just give me whatever
you'd have if you wanted to drink.

448
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,081
Please.

449
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,889
[man] Harsh.

450
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,554
Abandoned.

451
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,954
Fired.

452
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,398
lt's harsh, man.

453
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,235
Know what the best job
l ever got fired from was?

454
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,044
Pretzel kiosk.

455
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,983
Afternoon shift. Just loved it,
don't know why, just did.

456
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,418
Could be the apron, who the hell knows?

457
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,616
Or maybe the feeling of power you get
when there's a crowd.

458
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,251
One hand rolls dough,
ties those babies off.

459
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:27,594
The other hand maybe works the soda,
refills the mustard. lt's quite a thing.

460
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,223
l'll tell you a secret.

461
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,633
lf a pretzel is a quality pretzel,
you don't need salt.

462
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,399
lt's just a fact.

00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,545
[man] How come?

464
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,476
Your family up
and blew out of town on you?

465
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,183
Thank you, but l don't really feel like
talking about it right now.

466
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,884
- Thank you.
- Okay.

467
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,688
So, how come you got canned?

468
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,025
lt's a whole different topic.

Good for you.

What'd you go and blow up
at your boss for?

475
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,423
You know, it's like
a long, complicated story.

476
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,655
Well, that is sensational.
l'm the J-Man, by the way.

Another round, please.

Something fruity
for me and my friend, Tim.

Okay, Tim...

483
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,811

490
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,457
Our families do everything together.

491
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,698
- Used to go to work together every day.
- Keep it coming.

492
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,239
And he'd have these stupid...

493
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,673
He'd have these stupid ideas.

494
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,836
Open your heart. Open your heart.

495
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,142
Where does it come from?

496
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,806
Shit.

497
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,510
lt's all from shit.

498

You know who you are?
You're like that guy...

00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,885
Che, Che something.

500
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:36,120
- ''Che something''?
- Up with the people. People power.

501
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,288
Or the kid that stole a chicken
with the golden eggs.

502
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,991
What a fantastic chicken.

503
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,228
Who's for the giant? Nobody.
You hear what l'm saying.

504
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,860
You're the hero.

505
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,235
Forget Che! You're like Robin Hood.

506
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,604
- Robin Hood? Really?
- Listen to me.

507
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:54,270
Listen to me. Life's unfair.
lt's a raw deal planet, Jack.

You, my little dumbbell friend,
are Mr. Everyman

you like the grand turbo Mr. Everyman.

510
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,651
Honestly?

511
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,017
Come on.

512
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,216
You're like a great big dimwit.
You know that. Fantastic.

513
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,782
Everyman Dimwit.

514
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,557
That stinking family across the street.
Who wouldn't feel like you?

515
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,259
l like you.
l'm glad l came in here.

516
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,735
You know that?

517
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,433
Ringlets! Give me a break.
Let me tell you a little story.

518
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,066
When l was maybe 1 0,

519
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:29,671
there was this kid across the street,
Ernie ''Nice Kid.''

520
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:33,877
Ernie had everything.
Only kid around with a BB gun, okay?

521
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,978
So one night l see
the whole family drive off.

522
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:41,321
What'd l do? l sneak across the street
and find the BB gun.

523
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:45,852
l squeeze off maybe five, ten pot shots
at the windows...

524
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,761
Hello. ln my house.

525
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,063
- ln your house?
- Yes, you got...

526
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,932
You squoze off to your house?

527
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,472
You got it.
Next morning my old man gets up,

528
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,237
sees all these little BB holes
in our windows.

529
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,575
He marches across the street,
bangs on the door and Tim,

530
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,547
my little bozo friend,

531
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:08,949
things changed big time
over there in Ernieville.

532
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,491
That's what you got to do!

533
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,586
- What?
- Shake things up.

534
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,688
Over there, man.
Shake them up.

535
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:25,464
Make them think of something besides
the temperature in that candy-ass pool.

536
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:31,330
- Shit, what time is it?
- What kind of question is that?

537
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,245
l got to get back!
They can't build the pool!

538
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,446
lke, cab...

539
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,609
on the J-Man.

540
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,348
- [Vanderparks cheering, clapping]
- [Natalie] Come on!

541
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,118
Excuse me!

542
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,063
[whooping, laughter]

543
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,166
Sir! Sir!

544
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,793
You have to stop, please.

545
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,565
[Natalie] Here they come!

546
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,538
- Whoo!
- Hi, Mom!

547
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,802
Digging, no. We can't pay for the pool.

548
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,344
We don't... we can't pay for the pool.

549
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,812
No, no. Stop! Sir!
No mas!

550
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,816
- Sir, l'll talk to the office.
- [in Spanish]

551
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,148
Good afternoon, Mr. Tim.

552
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,588
- Hi.
- You look really, really wonderful.

553
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:23,320
And here is something from
your great friends across the street

554
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,056
while your wonderful family is away.

555
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,198
[Natalie, kids cheering]

556
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,603
''Thought you might enjoy a taste
from our newly acquired vineyard.''

557
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,057
~ [Envy reprise]

558
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:07,002
[J-Man] You got to shake things up.
Over there, man. Shake them up.

559
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,305
Carousel of dreams.

560
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,611
Casa Corky.

561
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,415
Casa Corky.

562
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,587
lncredible.

563
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,354
lncredible hedge work.

564
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,760
[J-Man] You got to shake things up.

565
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,964
Over there, man.
Shake them up.

566
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,600
Shake things up.
Shake them up.

567
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,264
[high-pitched whinny, thudding]

568
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,959
Huh?

569
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,209
Corky.

570
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,115
My God. How is this possible?

571
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,886
How could a little arrow
kill a big horse?

572
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,257
Come on, Corky.
Corky, come on, come on.

573
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,422
lt's just a little arrow.
Come on, Corky.

574
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,931
Giddy up, boy.

575
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,160
Corky. Giddy up. Giddy up.

576
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,169
Corky.

577
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,400
Okay, Corky.

578
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,673
Come on, boy. One, two.

579
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,769
Come on.

580
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,507
Shit.

581
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,073
Shit. God.

582
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,577
Come on, Corky.

583
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,553
[yelling]

584
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,205
[J-Man] Hey.

585
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,116
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

586
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:13,315
Car return.
How's that for service?

587
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,691
l'd probably still be driving a limo
if it wasn't for the hat.

588
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,786
Hats.

589
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,229
Hats make my head itch.

590
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,393
- What time is it?
- You got a time hang-up, don't you?

591
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,958
Oh, God.

592
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,562
- Look at me.
- l was thinking the same thing.

593
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,504
You are one big stinking pig, Tim.

594
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,235
- How'd you get my keys?
- Keys?

595
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,746
The J-Man don't usually need keys,
my little dumbbell pal.

596
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,840
So, that's the place?

597
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,648
Look at it. All from shit?
l see what you mean.

598
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,179
l don't even live here and that place
is pulling my testicles up.

599
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,091
l mean, literally,
they're actually coming up.

600
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,254
You ever get that?

601
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,797
l killed his horse.

602
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,526
- What?
- l killed his horse.

603
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,569
That story you were telling
about shaking things up...

604
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,105
l went over there and
l shot this bow and arrow,

605
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,700
and l shot at my house
and l hit his horse.

606
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,505
He was eating apples in my yard.

607
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:11,412
There was a hole because we were going
to have a pool and l buried him in it.

608
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,781
- Well, now.
- [Lula] Daddy! We're home!

609
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,217
No!

610
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,291
lt's my family.

611
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,622
- Hide!
- Hide?

612
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,559
Hide! Hide.

613
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,360
- Hide? Can't l just mosey off?
- No! Don't mosey off.

614
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,799
No, you can't mosey off.
They'll see you!

615
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,167
- So?
- So? So, what are you doing here?

616
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,331
Who are you?
You're some guy from a bar.

617
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,571
What's wrong with...?
l'm the J-Man, bringing your car back.

618
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,134
Daddy!

619
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,078
- Hey, tiger!
- Daddy!

620
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,447
- Hey, peanut.
- We all really missed you.

621
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,079
You look terrible.
Honey, one question.

622
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,283
What is at the heart of everything?
What l'm asking you is:

623
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,725
What is at the heart of the heart
of the heart of the heart?

624
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,821
Do you know what the answer is?
Self-love.

625
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,095
Windsong told me that l have been
hating myself for resenting you.

626
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,934
And you've been resenting yourself
for passing up on a big opportunity.

627
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,338
What we need to do
is we need to focus on what we have.

628
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,899
[screaming]

629
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,707
Hey! Oh, hey!

630
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,044
This is... This guy...

631
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,844
Honey...

632
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,478
this is...
This man is the man...

633
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,146
who was in the bathroom.
l didn't tell you.

634
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:35,697
Honey... something happened
while you were gone, something bad.

635
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,233
What?

636
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,928
l'll take it from here, Tim.

637
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,372
Mrs. Dingman...

638
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,136
l'm Elmo Carp, pool rep.

639
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,976
Your husband and l were up here
discussing your swimming pool options.

640
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,947
- Swimming pool options?
- Yes.

641
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,041
You see, we dug it,
we had to fill it back in.

642
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,645
We're sorry as heck.
Where do we go from here?

643
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,554
That's the point we were at
when you barged in.

644
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,525
l don't understand.
Fill it back in?

645
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,825
So you mean we're not getting a pool?

646
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:10,128
No, sonny boy, l'm afraid not.
Too many gosh darn pipes.

647
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,566
- Pipes?
- Yes.

648
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,865
Underground pipes in your yard,

649
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:19,035
but l've intruded enough
on your little family reunion here.

650
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,838
l'll be on my way.

651
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,778
And thanks for filthying up
your clothes,

652
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,782
helping me fill in the big hole, Tim.

653
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,081
Ma'am, your husband's
got the back of a coal miner.

654
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,589
l know because l've mined coal.
See you.

655
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,191
Something's happened to Corky.

656
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,894
- What?
- [kids] Corky?

657
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,437
- Have you seen Corky?
- l haven't seen Corky.

658
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,370
- Corky's gone?
- Have you seen Corky?

659
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,465
- l have not seen Corky.
- That's what l mean.

660
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,033
We've been looking and looking.
Where could he be?

661
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,603
- A great big horse, where?
- Nick, a horse can't just disappear.

662
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,876
- He's got to be somewhere.
- Yeah, but where?

663
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,113
Where? Where?
The kids are a mess.

664
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,781
Wish me luck.

665
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,354
Corky!

666
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,917
[Nick] Corky, come on!

667
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,094
Good afternoon.
My name is Natalie Vanderpark.

668
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,533
l'm running for state senate
in your district.

669
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,696
So l thought l'd
canvass the neighborhood

670
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,637
and introduce myself to everyone.

671
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,504
[man] Who it is, Mable?

672
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,602
lt's that woman running
for state senate, Carl.

673
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,444
The shit lady? No way.
We're going with Shaunessey.

674
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,075
Your opponent Shaunessey,

675
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,746
he asked a good question
on the radio this morning.

676
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,254
And what question was that?

677
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,692
Well, didn't your husband get loaded
making turds disappear?

678
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,959
My husband invented Vapoorize,
if that's what you're referring to.

679
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,557
That's what Shaunessey
was talking about.

680
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:54,502
Where do all them turds go?
l mean, they got to be somewhere.

681
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,040
First they're here,
then they're not here,

682
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,597
and then they disappear.

683
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:02,578
Where does the turd go to?
Really, tell me now.

685
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:27,567
So long, everybody.

686
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:29,899
- Bye, have a good day at work.
- Bye, Daddy.

687
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:33,566
- Bye, honey.
- Good luck at the salt mines, Dad.

688
00:43:38,246 --> 00:43:39,770
Where am l going?

689
00:43:39,847 --> 00:43:42,077
Wait. Timmy, wait!

690
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,710
Wait! God.

691
00:43:44,786 --> 00:43:46,447
Timmy, l can't find him.

692
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:48,989
l've been looking all night
and he's nowhere.

693
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:51,320
l know he's just a horse, but...

694
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:53,223
Corky.

695
00:43:53,294 --> 00:43:56,991
Corky! Where are you,
my Corky boy?

00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:59,032
[hysterical crying]

697
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:04,196
God, look at me.
This is crazy.

698
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:07,070
Will you pass these out
down at 3M for me?

699
00:44:08,676 --> 00:44:13,704
l found some grooming hairs
in his tail brush.

700
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,772
[wailing] My God.

701
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,284
- $50,000?
- [yelling] lt's pennies!

702
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:22,448
lt's pennies. Who cares?
Corky's my pal.

703
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:29,218
He's my pal and l'd pay $50,000 to
find you if you were lost, wouldn't l?

704
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:32,095
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't l?!

705
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:39,262
- Okay.
- [weeping uncontrollably]

706
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,876
All right.
lt's going to be okay.

707
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:42,308
All right.
lt's going to be okay.

709
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:16,638
Are you insane?

710
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:20,477
That is the most selfish thing
l ever heard in my life.

711
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:24,644
The guy loves you, man.
You'd be killing your best friend.

712
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,210
You killed his horse, right?
You killed his horse.

713
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:30,485
Now you want to tell him?
You tell him.

714
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:33,026
What about this?
We move the horse someplace else.

715
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:37,360
l find it, l get the reward.
l'm bending over backwards here.

716
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,490
How do we move a horse?

717
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,831
We dig him up. We haul him off.

718
00:45:41,903 --> 00:45:45,930
No, l mean...
without anybody seeing us.

719
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:47,838
You ever hear of night?

720
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:50,844
What about the noise?
My family's right there.

721
00:45:50,912 --> 00:45:52,777
l don't want them to...

722
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:55,008
You don't move the horse, l do,

723
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:57,380
while you and your family
are enjoying nature,

724
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,544
down at my cabin on the lake.

725
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,714
- You have a cabin on the lake?
- What?

726
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,781
You think l didn't have a childhood?

727
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:08,295
Bunk beds, hiking trails, hooty owls.

728
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:11,892
You can move a horse by yourself?

729
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:15,265
For 50 grand.

730
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:22,033
But l will say this:

731
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:26,505
Knowing what l happen to know
about things buried,

732
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,411

- [Tim] Hey, Deb?
- [Debbie] Mmm-hmm?

734
00:46:31,218 --> 00:46:33,482
How'd you like to go
to a nice cabin on a lake?

735
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:36,284
- Cabin on a lake?
- Yeah.

736
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:40,259
This guy at work offered his cabin.
lt's supposed to be really nice.

What do you mean, ''what a spot''?
l mean, where...

He said it's just down at the end
of the private driveway.

751

What private driveway?
This isn't a private driveway.

This is pretty private, honey.
l mean, this is great.

753

lt's not a mile, honey. lt seems longer

This is wild, huh, kids?

Kind of like a... Like an old
gingerbread house in the woods.

Where's the lake?

l'll tell you what. Why don't
we check out the bunkhouse, okay?

And then you guys can have a contest to
see who finds the lake first, all right?

- [Tim] lt's okay.

776
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,699
Just a little critter. Just...

777
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:12,940
Don't touch it. He's dead.

778
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:22,452
Under no circumstances
is this a lake.

779
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:27,387
Maybe there's a tide.

780
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:30,328
No one could ever find this lake.

781
00:49:30,397 --> 00:49:33,298
Congratulations,
you saved yourself 50 cents.

You're Tim?

Yes, l'm Tim.

791

Come quick?

Yeah, come quick.

you tell him we're even.

796

''Up your ass with Mobil gas.''

Okay.

says we're even

Neighbor?

so l'm going to help him, okay?

806
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:07,323
l didn't see any neighbors.

807
00:51:07,394 --> 00:51:09,555
What? You think Bosco would lie?

808
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,066
Why would Bosco lie?
l'll go get him right now if you want.

809
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:15,158
Okay.

810
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,537
- Okay?
- Yes.

811

Yes, l'd like to ask him
about this hellhole.

812
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:21,974
l don't want to bring him in.
He's big.

813
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:24,101
- You know, the floorboards.
- How big?

814
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:25,167
- How big?
- Yes.

815
00:51:25,246 --> 00:51:28,443
Big. He's like a bear of a guy
with, like, a little head.

816
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:31,744
l don't know what that means.

817
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:34,185
Look, l'm going to go help this guy

818
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:37,884
because Windsong would sure
as hell help this guy. Okay?

819

Just go back to sleep, okay?

- lt's for you.

Don't hassle me about crumbs, man,

824
00:52:16,997 --> 00:52:19,830
because l am on
the edge of the edge.

825
00:52:21,502 --> 00:52:22,560
Hello?

826
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:24,763
[Nick] Natalie stormed out
of the bedroom.

827
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:27,864
We had a terrible fight.
You got to come over here now.

828
00:52:27,941 --> 00:52:29,841
I know you got your Army pal
over there.

829
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,504
I didn't know you were in the Army.
If I can come over...

830
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:34,843
No, l'll come there.

831
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:37,577
- Okay, good. Thanks.
- No, no, no. l'll come over.

832
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:40,085
[Tim] l'll come there.
Here l come.

833
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:42,349
l got to go across the street
for a second.

834
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:44,983
That is incorrect. Follow me.

835
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:50,920
This was no picnic, let me tell you.

836
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:53,831
l had an '88 Ford flatbed

837
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:56,426
all lined up
with a brand-new winch,

838
00:52:56,503 --> 00:52:59,597
but l fried it during the hot-wire,
goddamn it.

839
00:52:59,673 --> 00:53:03,575
Good thing Monk passed out,
or l'd never got this baby.

840
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:06,938
Whoa.

841
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:10,040
What in the shit is this?
What is it?

842
00:53:10,984 --> 00:53:15,683
lt's winches, hoists, pulleys, blocks
and tackles. This kind of thing.

843
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:19,385
You know how l got the idea? You know
those big things on Easter lsland?

844
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,485
- Easter lsland?
- Huh?

845
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:22,654
Easter lsland?

846
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:26,962
With this device, l can place that horse
on top of any object.

847
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:29,696
That truck's too high.
You won't get the horse in there.

848
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:33,206
You're like a specially trained
super agent. You know that?

849
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:35,969
Why do you think l called you?
l was so pissed off.

850
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:40,241
l nearly climbed back into your house
and smashed some plates.

851
00:53:41,448 --> 00:53:44,383
Stand warned, okay, stand warned.

852
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:47,852
l have to go over there for a minute
or you don't get your money.

853
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:49,411
- Do you want your money?
- Yes.

854
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:53,517
Then put that horse on top of my van.
There's rope and tarp in the garage.

855
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:56,722
- Put the horse on the van?
- Put the horse on the van.

856
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,628
- Rope.
- Yeah, and be quiet.

857
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:00,132
lt's simple, okay?

858
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,395
- All right? l'll be right back.
- Yeah.

859
00:54:04,104 --> 00:54:05,366
Hello, Mr. Tim.

860
00:54:05,439 --> 00:54:08,306
You're looking very sprightly
for the hour.

861
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:12,072
We go up the stairs, please.
Right this way.

862
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:18,310
l've never been in this part.

863
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:21,946
They are practicing for the tournament.

864
00:54:26,827 --> 00:54:28,055
[woman] Come on!

865
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:29,561
Yes!

866
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:31,689
Who's your nanny?!

867
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:41,463
Hey.

868
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:43,271
[Nick] Come.

869
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:47,339
Come here.

870
00:54:48,248 --> 00:54:50,512
Right here, come on.

871
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:55,085
You're incredible, do you know that?
You're an incredible friend.

872
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:56,486
[loud clanging]

873
00:54:56,557 --> 00:54:59,993
- What the hell was that?
- They're bowling next door.

874
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,427
Getting ready for your tournament.
They're hitting strikes.

875
00:55:03,497 --> 00:55:05,829
- She's been blaming me for Corky.
- Who?

876
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:10,427
Natalie, she just kept blaming me
for Corky and making me feel guilty.

877
00:55:10,504 --> 00:55:12,597
Then she starts up with the shit thing.

878
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:14,800
How do l know where the shit goes?!

879
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:18,367
Then l tell her, ''l'm going to Rome
tomorrow,'' and she freaks out!

880
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:22,142
She has a complete flip out!
She flips out the room!

881
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:24,241
- Where'd she go?
- l don't know.

882
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,287
- Some other wing.
- [banging, clanking]

883
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:30,687
But, buddy...
this ltaly thing is huge.

884
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:33,624
lt could seriously...
lt could mean literally billions.

885
00:55:33,694 --> 00:55:37,653
You know what l think this is?
l think you just got to get some sleep.

886
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:41,565
You got to shut everything down.
Get under the covers. Come on.

887
00:55:41,635 --> 00:55:44,331
Get under the covers.
Don't listen to anything.

888
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:47,737
- Sometimes you think you hear things...
- You're a great friend.

889
00:55:50,511 --> 00:55:54,242
Sleep and it's going to be different
and don't wake up. Okay?

890
00:55:58,252 --> 00:55:59,913
[J-Man] ~ Valderi

891
00:55:59,987 --> 00:56:01,511
~ Valdera

892
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:03,112
~ Valderi

893
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,318
~ Valdera ha ha ha...

894
00:56:06,393 --> 00:56:08,327
~ Valderi

895
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:10,963
Et cetera.

896
00:56:11,031 --> 00:56:12,658
What about here? Right here?

897
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,997
You kidding? There's towns around.

898
00:56:15,068 --> 00:56:17,298
You want somebody else
finding my horse?

899
00:56:18,405 --> 00:56:20,236
There'll be towns everywhere.

900
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:23,140
Hey, six months l drove
a yogurt truck, okay?

901
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,007
This is my territory, Jack.

902
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:27,103
~ [man singing Valderi]

903
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:42,688
What do you got up there?

904
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,222
A sofa.

905
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,893
What kind of sofa?

906
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:49,560
Homemade.

907
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:01,077
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- Troopers.

908
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:03,708
Oh, no.

909
00:57:08,188 --> 00:57:09,655
The bridge is out.

910
00:57:09,723 --> 00:57:12,783
Follow the detour along the river
to the next bridge, all right?

911
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:14,053
Thank you very much.

912
00:57:14,127 --> 00:57:16,095
- Have a good night.
- Let's go.

913
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:18,654
He didn't notice the horse.

914
00:57:18,732 --> 00:57:23,260
Smokey didn't even notice
that we got a horse on the roof.

915
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:33,239
- l can't believe he didn't see it.
- [J-Man] Dumb Smokey.

916
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:48,151
- [Tim] How about right here?
- No, it's not good.

917
00:57:48,228 --> 00:57:50,662
- What's wrong with here?
- lt doesn't feel right.

918
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:52,722
l hope it's very soon.

919
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,257
l got to be back there.
lt's going to be light out.

920
00:57:56,336 --> 00:58:00,067
They're asleep and don't know you left.
l'm doing you a favor doing this.

921
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,199
How about here?
What's wrong with here?

922
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:05,005
l dig up the horse, l haul it up,
l invent everything.

923
00:58:05,078 --> 00:58:07,569
Why do we have to do
what you want to do?

924
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:10,116
- Corky's new home.
- This is not good for me.

925
00:58:10,183 --> 00:58:12,117
Forget it. This is it, right here.
Okay?

926
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,311
[J-Man] Bad vibe.

927
00:58:16,957 --> 00:58:19,425
[Tim] Oh, no! He's gone!

928
00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:23,286
Where'd he go?!

929
00:58:23,363 --> 00:58:26,332
Did you hear anything?
Like a thump?

930
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,596
Where did he go?

931
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,763
Shit!

932
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,274
- [Tim] Did you check the knots?
- [J-Man] Knots? Who knows knots?

933
00:58:35,342 --> 00:58:38,277
- Not you.
- You know, l'm not Popeye.

934
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:41,644
How did we not hear? How do you
not hear a horse fall off a car?

935
00:58:41,715 --> 00:58:44,206
Maybe he's not dead.
Maybe he ran away.

936
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:48,380
lt's raining so hard,
the horse might have fallen off

937
00:58:48,455 --> 00:58:51,356
and floated, who knows, into a ditch.

938
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:55,817
There's a river that runs
along this road. He could be in it.

939
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:58,456
Corky could be heading
for the open sea.

940
00:59:13,847 --> 00:59:16,873
- [cracking]
- [Debbie groans]

941
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:20,613
My God, honey.
What time is it?

942
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:22,814
lt's okay.
Go back to sleep.

943
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:24,584
Yeah?

944
00:59:24,658 --> 00:59:26,592
Did you solve the problem?

945
00:59:27,728 --> 00:59:29,696
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

946
00:59:29,763 --> 00:59:31,458
Actually...

947
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,465
l think l did.

948
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:41,498
[Tim] ~ Gonna be a bright
Bright sunshiny day

949
00:59:41,575 --> 00:59:43,600
Whoo!

950
00:59:43,677 --> 00:59:48,239
~ Gonna be a bright
Bright sunshiny day

951
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:49,748

952
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:53,081
- [whistling]
- [Debbie] Timmy! Telephone!

954
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:55,619
[melodic dog bark doorbell]

955
01:00:01,595 --> 01:00:03,256
Good morning, Mr. Tim.

956
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,592
l must say...

957
01:00:04,664 --> 01:00:07,861
you're looking fit as a fiddle
this morning, Mr. Tim.

958
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:10,368
Thanks.
l hear Mr. Nick wants to see me.

959
01:00:10,437 --> 01:00:11,961
Yes, l know.

960
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:15,132
He's running in the woods.

961
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:18,336
l talked to the guys over at 3M.
l know you got canned.

962
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,073
You've met Pete, right?
My trainer.

963
01:00:21,148 --> 01:00:24,083
Don't feel funny around Pete.
l got no secrets from Pete.

964
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:26,051
- Do l, Pete?
- l don't think so.

965
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:28,587
So here's the deal:
Buddy boy...

966
01:00:28,655 --> 01:00:32,386
that my little hearty
hi-ho Silver routine

967
01:00:32,459 --> 01:00:36,418
affected you like that,
all l can say is, l am such a jerk.

968
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:38,623
But it's the best thing
that ever happened,

969
01:00:38,698 --> 01:00:41,667
because now l'll go kick ass in Rome.
And guess what?

970
01:00:41,735 --> 01:00:45,432
You, you unemployed bum,
you'll come kick ass with me.

971
01:00:45,505 --> 01:00:47,302
l want us to be partners.

972
01:00:47,374 --> 01:00:49,842
l want us to be equal again, man.

973
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,004
Why not? l mean, for crying out loud,
l've got a Pete.

974
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:56,913
Why shouldn't you have a Pete?
Who wouldn't like having a Pete?

975
01:00:56,983 --> 01:01:00,180
So this is the deal.
From now on, you and me, 50l50.

976
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:04,019
- 50l50?
- That's right. 50l50.

977
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,787
l'll talk to my lawyer. Why didn't
l think of it sooner? lt's awesome!

978
01:01:07,861 --> 01:01:11,627
Get the hell out of here,
the limo leaves in an hour and a half!

979
01:01:11,698 --> 01:01:14,496
Buddy boy! Let's go, buddy boy!

980
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:19,233
All right. Come on. Now, pump it up.
l want full cardio blast now.

981
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:21,501
- Let's go.
- Don't be shy.

982
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:24,274
There you go.

983
01:01:25,045 --> 01:01:27,536
No, keep going! Keep it there!

984
01:01:30,317 --> 01:01:31,579
Crampers.

985
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:33,676
- You all right?
- Crampers.

986
01:01:33,753 --> 01:01:35,914
l don't know, honey.
Do you want to do this?

987
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:38,389
l mean, do we want to be part
of the shit industry?

988
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,291
What about the heart of the heart
of the heart of the heart?

989
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:45,263
l don't think this conflicts with that.
l mean, you know, there's...

990
01:01:45,332 --> 01:01:49,894
lt's a lot of money and the heart
of the heart, and they're both...

991
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:54,165
Still have the heart
with a lot of money.

992
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:57,142
- l think. You know.
- You know what l think?

993
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,044
l think l know what we should do.
We should just try it.

994
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:02,741
- Try it!
- Yes.

995
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:03,805
- Try it.
- Try it.

996
01:02:03,884 --> 01:02:05,476
Try it.

997
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,077
- Try it. See how it feels.
- Try it.

998
01:02:08,154 --> 01:02:10,019
[both giggling]

999
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,558
Oh, my God, l can't believe it!

1000
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:18,354
- Bye, Daddy.
- We'll miss you.

1001
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:20,422
- We miss you already.
- l'll be home soon.

1002
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,866
[continue shouting]

1003
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:36,075
Good to see you, captain.

1004
01:02:44,756 --> 01:02:47,418
You know what l was thinking?
We should target zoos.

1005
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:48,823
Thank you, Denise. Zoos?

1006
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:51,794
Yeah, zoos. l mean, come on,
they're full of poop.

1007
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:54,889
l popped on the lnternet
just before we got on the plane.

1008
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:58,629
Did you know that an elephant goes,
like 1 00 pounds a day?

1009
01:02:58,703 --> 01:03:02,799
Times that by seven, that's 700 pounds
of dung a week for one elephant.

1010
01:03:02,874 --> 01:03:05,775
There's got to be thousands of zoos
in the world.

1011
01:03:05,843 --> 01:03:09,870
That is really very good. Zoos.

1012
01:03:09,947 --> 01:03:11,938
- l got another one for you.
- [Nick] Yeah?

1013
01:03:12,016 --> 01:03:14,883
Travel industry.
We get into the travel industry.

1014
01:03:14,952 --> 01:03:18,115
l'm talking about little
travel-size Vapoorize.

1015
01:03:18,189 --> 01:03:21,454

But l've revised my thinking
about the $50,000 grand thing.

1180
01:13:07,778 --> 01:13:12,306

l mean, what are we, animals?

1181

- No, of course not.

How can we be partners?

You ever hear of ''reach for the sky''?

1318
01:21:10,393 --> 01:21:13,453
You just shoot a guy in the back

1319
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,157
That's right.

1320
01:21:15,232 --> 01:21:17,632
That's correct.
That's right. That's what l do.

1321

into a dark day.

You got to talk to him.
We were pals.

Who shoots a pal in the back
with a bow and arrow?

1325
01:21:30,046 --> 01:21:32,776
- Over a couple of bucks.
- Me.

1326
01:21:32,849 --> 01:21:36,080
l'm an archer and l shoot arrows.

1327
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:39,610
And l got more back
where they came from. My quiver.

1328

Listen to me.
l just wanted what you wanted.

A little taste of the good life.

1330
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:47,421
A little taste of honey.
ls that so bad? ls it?

1331

But you win.

1332
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:54,828
Man, l fold. l can see it:
Greed has hardened your heart.

1333
01:21:54,905 --> 01:21:57,533
And money's poisoned your soul.

1334
01:21:57,607 --> 01:21:59,336
l'm out of here.

1335
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:02,344
There's nothing as dangerous
as large quantities of money.

1336
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:06,473
That's why l've always remained an
independent contractor, an odd job man.

1337
01:22:06,549 --> 01:22:08,210
l want no part of this.

1338
01:22:09,286 --> 01:22:13,552
l stand before you, begging:
Take the arrow out of my back.

1339
01:22:13,623 --> 01:22:15,591
You will never see me again.

1340
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:20,096
Help me, God! Come on.

1341
01:22:20,163 --> 01:22:22,631
- [J-Man sobs]
- Honey...

1342
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:25,725
take the arrow out of his back.

1343
01:22:29,339 --> 01:22:31,637
[J-Man whimpering]

1344
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:33,733
- [J-Man grimaces]
- [wincing]

1345
01:22:37,314 --> 01:22:39,145
Thank you.

1346
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:44,145
- [panting] Thank you.
- Souvenir.

1347
01:23:04,641 --> 01:23:08,509
~ [Envy reprise]

1348
01:23:40,676 --> 01:23:42,405
- Hey!
- Hey.

1349
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:45,973
l couldn't sleep.
l got to talk to you.

1350
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,606
Yeah, l got to talk to you too.

1351
01:23:47,683 --> 01:23:50,948
You know, this big rally tomorrow,
l'm a wreck about it.

1352
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:54,387
l got to give a big speech.
l'm not a speech guy.

1353
01:23:54,456 --> 01:23:57,584
Are you kidding?
Come on, those infomercials you did.

1354
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,217
You're great in front of people.

1355
01:23:59,294 --> 01:24:02,286
Really? You thought l was good?
You never said a word about it.

1356
01:24:03,332 --> 01:24:06,961
Because it was just another thing
of yours that made me miserable.

1357
01:24:07,036 --> 01:24:08,298
What?

1358
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,838
This is what l have to talk
to you about. Sit down.

1359
01:24:15,044 --> 01:24:16,841
l killed Corky.

1360
01:24:18,614 --> 01:24:19,774
You...

1361
01:24:23,118 --> 01:24:24,380
[softly] When?

1362
01:24:24,453 --> 01:24:27,786
Now, please, just don't say anything
till l'm done, all right?

1363
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:30,222
The day that you gave me the wine,
remember?

1364
01:24:30,292 --> 01:24:32,624
l got drunk on the wine.

1365
01:24:32,694 --> 01:24:37,063
l actually was drunk from before.
l went into your yard and...

1366
01:24:49,244 --> 01:24:51,804
So that's it.
There you have it.

1367
01:24:53,415 --> 01:24:56,646
Well, you know, it sounds like
it was an accident.

1368
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:59,243
- Why didn't you tell me?
- l should've told you.

1369
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:02,256
That's the thing.
But l don't know what happened.

1370
01:25:02,324 --> 01:25:05,885
l felt guilty or something.

1371
01:25:05,961 --> 01:25:10,022
And l was just so wrapped up in the envy
that l felt for everything you had.

1372
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:11,566
lt's true what they say.

1373
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:16,036
lt's like a little green monster that
comes out and it just poisoned my head.

1374
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:18,699
And, by the way, you did nothing wrong.

1375
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:21,572
You followed your dream.
You did what you wanted to do.

1376
01:25:21,643 --> 01:25:24,669
l was always saying, ''Don't do it.''
You did it and it worked.

1377
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:28,341
Look, you built a house, right?
That's all you did. You built a house.

1378
01:25:28,417 --> 01:25:31,944
l mean, it's a big house.
l mean, it's a really big house.

1379
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,116
lt's a large house.
lt's a... l mean, it's...

1380
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:39,991
lt's gigantic, Nick.
lt's the White House.

1381
01:25:40,062 --> 01:25:43,088
You built the White House here,
and we're in the shadow of it.

1382
01:25:43,165 --> 01:25:45,656
Literally, every day at 4:00,
we're in its shadow.

1383
01:25:45,734 --> 01:25:48,362
That's not your fault.
You wanted to be friends still,

1384
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:50,337
you didn't want to move
and l love that.

1385
01:25:50,405 --> 01:25:52,839
lt was coming from such a good place,
but it was...

1386
01:25:52,908 --> 01:25:55,775
lt really got to me because every day
l'd have to look at you,

1387
01:25:55,844 --> 01:25:57,675
and see you with all of this stuff.

1388
01:25:57,746 --> 01:26:01,910
You know, buy the yellow Lamborghini
that goes 500 miles an hour.

1389
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,919
Have a bowling alley next to your room.
lf l could do it, l would.

1390
01:26:04,987 --> 01:26:07,785
Everybody should have a merry-go-round.
Of course you should.

1391
01:26:07,856 --> 01:26:10,825
Jealousy, every day.
And it was just chewing me up.

1392
01:26:10,893 --> 01:26:14,192
Your kid's playing the concert piano,
my kid's banging trash cans.

1393
01:26:14,263 --> 01:26:15,992
And that has nothing to do with money.

1394
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:19,158
That's just his musical ability.
That's a whole other thing.

1395
01:26:19,234 --> 01:26:22,567
You just gave to us. You gave
and you gave and you're so generous.

1396
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:24,162
And what am l going to give you?

1397
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,970
l gave you tube socks for Christmas
last year. That's not going to work.

1398
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:30,068
- l like the socks.
- You gave us so much.

1399
01:26:30,145 --> 01:26:34,047
The coffee machine. lt's a beautiful,
giant rocketship-sized coffee machine.

1400
01:26:34,116 --> 01:26:37,643
Debbie loved the coffee. l'll tell you
something, l never tasted it.

1401
01:26:37,719 --> 01:26:39,778
l wanted to tell you that.

1402
01:26:39,855 --> 01:26:42,346
l can't even tell you
l haven't tried the coffee.

1403
01:26:42,424 --> 01:26:44,858
Like l'll feel better
if l don't drink your coffee.

1404
01:26:44,927 --> 01:26:47,828
And you gave our kids flan.
All of a sudden my son's going,

1405
01:26:47,896 --> 01:26:49,625
''Daddy, where's the flan?''

1406
01:26:49,698 --> 01:26:52,826
lt felt like a dagger in my heart
every time he'd request flan.

1407
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:54,391
lt made me feel little.

1408
01:26:54,469 --> 01:26:57,370
l felt like a little man
who didn't like flan.

1409
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:00,499
The horse was great, Nick.
Of course you should have a horse.

1410
01:27:00,576 --> 01:27:03,977
Does it have to be a white horse
that you come galloping up on,

1411
01:27:04,046 --> 01:27:05,911
and it neighs
and makes the whole thing?

1412
01:27:05,981 --> 01:27:10,350
Of course. Make it a beautiful horse
that l think, honestly, didn't like me.

1413
01:27:10,419 --> 01:27:13,217
lt had nothing to do with anything,
l never clicked with it.

1414
01:27:13,288 --> 01:27:16,883
l think the horse sensed something.
l think ''horse sense'' is a real thing.

1415
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:21,123
Because the horse had a feeling.
He came over and sensed the envy l felt.

1416
01:27:21,196 --> 01:27:25,064
He'd come over and eat the apples.
He'd see me and give me a weird look.

1417
01:27:25,133 --> 01:27:29,570
l'm telling you. You know how sometimes
the side of a face and you get one eye?

1418
01:27:29,638 --> 01:27:32,607
He would keep the eye on me
and l knew he was thinking something.

1419
01:27:32,674 --> 01:27:36,132
That's unrelated to what happened
with the arrow. That was an accident.

1420
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:39,146
l swear to God. l swear to God.
l couldn't do it if l tried.

1421
01:27:39,214 --> 01:27:44,083
l'm sorry about this.
l feel horrible. l feel bad.

1422
01:27:44,152 --> 01:27:47,849
l feel like l have this fountain
in my yard that l don't deserve.

1423
01:27:47,923 --> 01:27:50,050
l don't deserve to be your partner.

1424
01:27:51,126 --> 01:27:54,323
l don't deserve to be your friend.
l just...

1425
01:27:54,396 --> 01:27:57,126
Well, you know what, Tim?
You made a mistake.

1426
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:59,827
You're human.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1427
01:28:00,402 --> 01:28:03,064
So what, man?
You're still my best friend.

1428
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:05,504
- Really?
- Of course.

1429
01:28:07,175 --> 01:28:10,076
Of course. Come on, man.

1430
01:28:10,145 --> 01:28:12,113
lt was a big mistake.

1431
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:15,672
lt was a big mistake.
lt was a doozy.

1432
01:28:16,918 --> 01:28:18,408
[whispering] Corky.

1433
01:28:18,487 --> 01:28:21,183
- l'm sorry, Nick.
- No, no. lt's okay.

1434
01:28:21,256 --> 01:28:23,520
l know how much
you loved him and l...

1435
01:28:23,592 --> 01:28:26,652
[sighing deeply] l did love Corky.

1436
01:28:26,728 --> 01:28:28,559
l never liked Corky.

1437
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:31,963
l mean, he's beautiful on the outside.
lt's just something wasn't...

1438
01:28:32,034 --> 01:28:33,296
We're still partners.

1439
01:28:33,368 --> 01:28:36,531
There is no way you are getting out
of this partnership.

1440
01:28:36,605 --> 01:28:38,300
- Okay.
- Okay?

1441
01:28:38,373 --> 01:28:40,534
And l will see you tomorrow
at the big rally.

1442
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:42,042
[sighing]

1443
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,634
- Yeah.
- Good.

1444
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,607
[Nick] Big day.

1445
01:28:46,682 --> 01:28:48,513
Big day.

1446
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:51,108
Poor Corky.
One little target arrow.

1447
01:28:51,186 --> 01:28:53,746
You wouldn't think that could kill
a great big horse.

1448
01:28:53,822 --> 01:28:55,551
That's exactly what l thought.

1449
01:28:55,624 --> 01:28:58,218
lt's one little arrow
and when l shot the bum...

1450
01:28:58,293 --> 01:29:00,625
he hardly seemed to notice.

1451
01:29:02,264 --> 01:29:05,233
You know, that fountain
looked a lot better in Rome.

1452
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:09,732
- Yeah.
- Well...

1453
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:13,502
C'est la vie, as the Romans say.

1454
01:29:17,879 --> 01:29:20,439
[Natalie] On this beautiful, clear day,

1455
01:29:20,515 --> 01:29:23,916
l think it is appropriate
that we clear the air

1456
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:31,118
of the toxic distortions that
my husband and, by association, myself,

1457
01:29:31,193 --> 01:29:36,825
are somehow poisoning our environment
in our efforts to purify it.

1458
01:29:36,898 --> 01:29:40,425
lt's not true. No es verdad.

1459
01:29:41,937 --> 01:29:43,666
[Natalie] Ladies and gentlemen...

1460
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:46,833
please help me welcome
Nick Vanderpark and Tim Dingman.

1461
01:29:46,908 --> 01:29:49,103
[cheering, applause]

1462
01:29:56,918 --> 01:30:00,183
[shouts of protest]

1463
01:30:01,923 --> 01:30:03,288
Thank you.

1464
01:30:03,358 --> 01:30:07,021
Ladies and gentlemen, young people.

1465
01:30:07,662 --> 01:30:10,654
l stand here with my partner,
Tim Dingman...

1466
01:30:10,732 --> 01:30:12,324
[light applause]

1467
01:30:12,401 --> 01:30:13,993
That's right.

1468
01:30:15,604 --> 01:30:19,665
...grateful for this opportunity
to address the central question

1469
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:25,338
posed in so many colorful
and eloquent variations.

1470
01:30:26,248 --> 01:30:31,379
[Nick] Where is the shit?!

1471
01:30:31,453 --> 01:30:33,080
[applause]

1472
01:30:34,456 --> 01:30:37,357
[Natalie] My God. Nick. Nick!

1473
01:30:37,426 --> 01:30:39,087
Corky?

1474
01:30:41,696 --> 01:30:44,995
[woman] Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpark,
sorry we had to perform an autopsy,

1475
01:30:45,066 --> 01:30:48,365
but when any large dead animal
comes in proximity with the public

1476
01:30:48,437 --> 01:30:51,065
it must be examined immediately
for health reasons.

1477
01:30:51,139 --> 01:30:54,233
l'm a little curious. Did you feed
your horse a lot of apples?

1478
01:30:54,309 --> 01:30:58,575
Our neighbors have an apple tree.
Corky loved their apples.

1479
01:30:58,647 --> 01:31:01,616
- Did he ever defecate in their yard?
- l imagine.

1480
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:06,082
Can you tell me what you did
when the horse defecated in your yard?

1481
01:31:06,154 --> 01:31:10,386
We used Vapoorize
because Nick invented it.

1482
01:31:10,459 --> 01:31:12,723
We get crates of it for free.

1483
01:31:12,794 --> 01:31:14,557
Well...

1484
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:16,688
lt's all making sense.

1485
01:31:18,867 --> 01:31:20,664
The horse was poisoned.

1486
01:31:20,735 --> 01:31:24,762
We did find a broken shaft of
a small target arrow in the sternum,

1487
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,536
but that played no part
in the horse's death.

1488
01:31:27,609 --> 01:31:32,103
The horse died from the prolonged
ingesting of a certain chemical,

1489
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:36,583
which by itself is harmless, but when
combined with certain fecal bacteria

1490
01:31:36,651 --> 01:31:38,710
becomes a lethal poison.

1491
01:31:40,222 --> 01:31:41,814
A little person?

1492
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:44,256
Lethal poison.

1493
01:31:44,326 --> 01:31:48,956
That chemical is the ingredient in every
can of your so-called miracle invention.

1494
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:51,521
He had enough of it literally
to kill a horse.

1495
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:58,367
l am obligated, of course,
to report this to the EPA.

1496
01:32:00,075 --> 01:32:01,667
EPA?

1497
01:32:01,743 --> 01:32:03,210
Mmm-hmm.

1498
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:06,975
Environmental Protection Agency?

1499
01:32:07,048 --> 01:32:10,484
Do you have to do that?
Right. You have to.

1500
01:32:10,552 --> 01:32:12,816
[sobbing]

1501
01:32:12,888 --> 01:32:16,688
- lt's all right.
- Every time without exception?

1502
01:32:26,868 --> 01:32:31,601
[auctioneer] The next item, an extra
large bed that sleeps nine comfortably,

1503
01:32:31,673 --> 01:32:34,005
for, let's say, $1 00.

1504
01:32:34,075 --> 01:32:38,136
XL bed, sleeping nine.
Got to love it for $1 00.

1505
01:32:38,213 --> 01:32:42,912
$ 72 for this white statue of a man
on a horse with a spray can.

1506
01:32:42,984 --> 01:32:44,542
$ 72, anyone? No?

1507
01:32:45,854 --> 01:32:48,254
Anybody need a portable phone?
Everyone needs one.

1508
01:32:48,323 --> 01:32:50,883
You want one in your kitchen,
in your extra bedroom.

1509
01:32:50,959 --> 01:32:54,224
You got a portable phone right there.
lt's going to go for $5.

1510
01:32:54,296 --> 01:32:55,854
The next thing is item 31 .

1511
01:32:55,931 --> 01:33:00,300
l like this bug net. Why don't we
find out the estimated cost?

1512
01:33:00,969 --> 01:33:06,339
Oh, we've got two cases
of a semi-gourmet flan.

1513
01:33:06,408 --> 01:33:10,435
l believe that's some sort of
custard dish or something.

1514
01:33:10,512 --> 01:33:15,074
The semi-gourmet flan
is going to start the bidding at $4.

1515
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:17,380
- Nick?
- Yeah.

1516
01:33:19,321 --> 01:33:21,915
l think l have an idea.

1517
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:25,118
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Like a really big idea.

1518
01:33:25,193 --> 01:33:26,091
Really?

1519
01:33:26,161 --> 01:33:28,755
When you got your idea,
did you feel it immediately?

1520
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,559
Oh, yeah. Right away.

1521
01:33:30,632 --> 01:33:32,623
You got one of those?
Like one of my ideas?

1522
01:33:32,701 --> 01:33:35,101
- l think so.
- What is it?

1523
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:43,007
Yes!

1524
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,642
Hey. Hey! Stop the auction!

1525
01:33:50,151 --> 01:33:54,554
You just cannot eat flan
and drive at the same time.

1526
01:33:54,623 --> 01:33:57,148
Look, l've got flan all over me.

1527
01:33:57,225 --> 01:33:59,625
Can't somebody come up
with a better idea?!

1528
01:33:59,694 --> 01:34:01,628
- [Tim] We have.
- [applause]

1529
01:34:01,696 --> 01:34:03,163
That's right!

1530
01:34:03,898 --> 01:34:08,232
Be one of the millions enjoying the
taste sensation sweeping the nation.

1531
01:34:08,303 --> 01:34:10,294
Nick's talking about Pocket Flan!

1532
01:34:10,372 --> 01:34:11,805
[Nick] Pocket Flan!

1533
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:15,605
- No spoon, no mess!
- That's right.

1534
01:34:15,677 --> 01:34:17,110
Three simple steps, folks.

1535
01:34:17,178 --> 01:34:19,339
- Just flip it!
- Flip it!

1536
01:34:19,414 --> 01:34:21,279
- Squeeze it!
- Squeeze it!

1537
01:34:21,349 --> 01:34:23,214
Mmm.

1538
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:25,809
- And enjoy.
- Enjoy!

1539
01:34:25,887 --> 01:34:28,583
Wait a second, Tim.
What was that name again?

1540
01:34:28,657 --> 01:34:30,625
Pocket Flan!

1541
01:34:30,692 --> 01:34:32,182
lsn't that just fantastic?

1542
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,093
No, Nick, it's not fantastic.
lt's flan-tastic.

1543
01:34:35,163 --> 01:34:36,596
[audience laughs]

1544
01:34:36,665 --> 01:34:39,930
Yeah, but, Tim, Nick, l have a question.

1545
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:43,402
How about us
who are lactose-intolerant?

1546
01:34:43,471 --> 01:34:46,531
We've got a new soy-based Pocket Flan.

1547
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:50,534
~ [Envy reprise]

1548
01:35:37,826 --> 01:35:39,657
lt's flan in a tube.

1549
01:35:39,728 --> 01:35:41,593
lt's a little bit of happiness
in a tube.

1550
01:35:41,663 --> 01:35:43,460
Let's say l'm jogging.

1551
01:35:43,531 --> 01:35:47,968
l'm getting tired, l need a pick-me-up.
What am l going to do, get a candy bar?

1552
01:35:48,036 --> 01:35:51,335
lmagine if you're jogging
with some of this stuff.

1553
01:35:51,406 --> 01:35:53,465
What's going on?
lt's not going to work.

1554
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:56,442
Here's the other thing.
You're eating your flan, you're like:

1555
01:35:56,511 --> 01:35:57,535
''That's good.

1556
01:35:57,612 --> 01:36:00,809
''l want to get down there
where it's brown and super-sugary.''

1557
01:36:00,882 --> 01:36:03,749
Where do you...? l can't...
ln here we've mixed it up.

1558
01:36:03,818 --> 01:36:05,877
You've got all that. lt's pre-mixed.

1559
01:36:05,954 --> 01:36:08,923
The brown is always part of it.
Even if you don't see it.

1560
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:12,687
ln the Tour de France, they're going
20 miles a day, going up mountains.

1561
01:36:12,761 --> 01:36:15,696
What do you think they pull out
of their Spandex bikini bottom

1562
01:36:15,764 --> 01:36:18,130
to squeeze into their mouth
when they want to eat?

1563
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:21,532
- Pocket Flan!
- And here's another question.

1564
01:36:21,603 --> 01:36:24,504
What if l'm doing
some skydiving and l'm like:

1565
01:36:24,572 --> 01:36:27,166
''l got to get some...
l'm going to get some cornflakes.

1566
01:36:27,242 --> 01:36:30,302
''l don't have time for cornflakes.
l do have time for flan.''

1567
01:36:30,378 --> 01:36:32,744
[Tim] That's right.
l'd love to see this...

1568
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:35,308
This has been vacuum-tested

1569
01:36:35,383 --> 01:36:38,375
to a depth of 200 feet
if you're scuba diving.

1570
01:36:38,453 --> 01:36:41,445
Just the other day l see
this kid walking down the street.

1571
01:36:41,523 --> 01:36:43,957
- He has the Pocket Flan. Right?
- Right.

1572
01:36:44,025 --> 01:36:47,392
He squeezes it... he's on a skateboard.
He squeezes it...

1573
01:36:47,462 --> 01:36:50,659
lt arcs up. He goes like... and...

1574
01:36:50,732 --> 01:36:52,757
That's like a new skateboard trick.

1575
01:36:52,834 --> 01:36:56,167
Who here likes to drive?
You guys like to drive? Yeah.

1576
01:36:56,237 --> 01:36:59,104
Who here likes to drive race cars?
Anybody? All right.

1577
01:36:59,174 --> 01:37:01,039
l'm Captain Speedway,

1578
01:37:01,109 --> 01:37:06,240
and nothing tastes better at 200 miles
per hour than Pocket Flan.

1579
01:37:06,314 --> 01:37:10,614
Firemen. ''l got to go save someone.
Maybe l need a little extra something.''

1580
01:37:10,685 --> 01:37:13,916
''Where am l gonna put my hose?
l can't hold the hose and this thing.

1581
01:37:13,988 --> 01:37:15,979
- [Nick laughing]
- ''Where's the hose go?

1582
01:37:16,057 --> 01:37:18,651
''l put a hose under my arm
and then l fight the fire.''

1583
01:37:18,726 --> 01:37:21,126
This is on a serious note.

1584
01:37:21,196 --> 01:37:27,567
Recently we received a letter
from a woman, Gladys, who...

1585
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:30,535
well, Pocket Flan saved her life.

1586
01:37:30,605 --> 01:37:33,301
- All right.
- [applause]

1587
01:37:33,374 --> 01:37:36,935
She was a backpacker.
She was stuck out in the woods...

1588
01:37:37,011 --> 01:37:39,502
and, by God, Pocket Flan...

1589
01:37:39,581 --> 01:37:41,674
[laughing] l can't think of it.

1590
01:37:41,749 --> 01:37:45,412
l wanted to say some tearful thing,
but l couldn't think of a thing.

1591
01:37:45,486 --> 01:37:47,477
[audience clapping]
