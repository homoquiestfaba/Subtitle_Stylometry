could you explain how I did?

lawyer want to destroy us?

01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:50,720
He's not my family lawyer.
I'd never seen him before.

1023
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:56,243
He's really Cuthbert Crawls, the
partner of Cosgoode Creeps.

haunted the Beauregard Sanders Mansion...

of miles to haunt a lawyer's office, anyway?

He wasn't there to scare us off.
He was there to draw us in.

1039
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:53,408

by Mrs. Vanders...

1040
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:56,661
into believing I could recreate
my uncle's experiment.

1041
01:05:56,662 --> 01:06:00,707
<i>Which I did. At least, enough</i>
<i>to create a diversion.</i>

1042

were trying to scare us off from?

1046

1047
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:16,764
