1
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,740
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

2
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,478
- I did not!
- Yes, you did.

3
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,952
Just let me play with it.
Come on, you promised.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,512
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,217
- I did not!
- Yes, you did...

6
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,494
What's the problem?

7
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,553
- Nothing.
- Then chill out.

8
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,324
Dad, he promised to let me play with it.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,868
And now he says he didn't, and he won't.

10
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,606
Did you?

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,107
- Did I what?
- Did you promise?

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,080
Yeah, but no big deal.

13
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,374
Yes, it is.

14
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,952
Yes, it is a big deal.

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,683
You can't just say, "I promise,"
and then forget about it.

16
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,220
"I promise" are the most important words
you'll ever say.

17
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,658
Well, almost the most important words
you'll ever say.

18
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,933
- You know what I mean?
- No, why?

19
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,141
Because I say so, that's why.

20
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,736
No, because it only takes a second
to say "I promise"...

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,210
but the commitment could last
the rest of your life.

22
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,965
Remember I told you guys about
Uncle Bobby and me when we were kids?

23
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,397
- Yeah.
- Of course.

24
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,305
I didn't tell you the whole story because...

25
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,601
I left out a bunch of stuff
because I figured you guys were too young.

26
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,148
Well, I guess now is as good a time as any.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,484
In fact, now is just about perfect. Okay.

28
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,190
All right, listen up.
But I want you to remember something:

29
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,664
History is all in the mind of the teller.

30
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,963
Truth is all in the telling.

31
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,407
Understand?

32
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,576
Not really.

33
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,505
Don't worry about it. You will.

34
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,746
To understand the whole thing...

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,879
to understand why a promise
is such a big and important deal...

36
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,082
you gotta go back...

37
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,022
to before any of it ever happened.

38
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:48,797
<i>Back to before we ever lived in Novato,</i>
<i>before we even came to California. </i>

39
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,901
<i>Back even before we were born. </i>

40
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,766
Go ahead.

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,438
<i>You have to go way back</i>
<i>to a kid named Fisher... </i>

42
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,715
<i>who wanted to be a legend. </i>

43
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,911
Come on, guys. We're almost there.

44
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,450
Careful, all right?

45
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,084
- Hold it steady.
- I got it.

46
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,868
Fisher, it can't be done!

47
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,441
- It can be done.
- No, it can't, God damn it!

48
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,016
It's far as a football field to that fence!

49
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,486
Come on, Fish, listen to us.
We're your friends!

50
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,046
This is nuts, Fish. You're gonna get hurt.

51
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,919
- Don't do this.
- Cape.

52
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,324
Come on, keep it steady.
Don't let it fall, okay?

53
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,693
He's not gonna listen.

54
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,038
<i>That's exactly how Fisher got remembered:</i>

55
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,332
Flag it!

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,807
<i>... as a legend. </i>

57
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,911
<i>Ten years later,</i>
<i>when we finally got to California... </i>

58
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,715
<i>his legend would change our lives forever. </i>

59
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,986
Careful, man!

60
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,449
- Watch out!
- God, what have we done?

61
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,234
Oh, my God!

62
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,913
- Hang on, Fish!
- We're coming for you!

63
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,491
Oh, man! He's...

64
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,426
Alive!

65
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,430
- Your leg.
- It's twisted.

66
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,305
Don't touch me!

67
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,671
You did it, man! You flew!

68
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,636
All right, Fish!

69
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,974
- You did it.
- I did it.

70
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,250
I really flew.

71
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,271
Bobby, close the window.
You've been flying for three hours.

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,300
- But I like the wind.
- Yes, I know you do.

73
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,138
Yuck.

74
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,547
It's my scoop. You had the last one.

75
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,220
But that is the last one.

76
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,483
Okay, we'll share it. Fifty-fifty. Here.

77
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:37,155
<i>One day, before the long trip,</i>
<i>our dad didn't come home. </i>

78
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,294
<i>Our mom knew why, but she never told us</i>
<i>and we never asked her... </i>

79
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,892
<i>because we knew it made her sad. </i>

80
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,206
That's eight jars, Mom. How far is that?

81
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,878
- Mom?
- What?

82
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,913
How far is that, eight jars?

83
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,649
I don't know. You have to check it out.

84
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,816
1,500 miles.

85
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,621
- Does it snow in California?
- No. It doesn't rain, either.

86
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,455
Thank you.

87
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,866
<i>Mom had waited three months</i>
<i>for him to come back. </i>

88
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,870
<i>When she was pretty sure he wasn't,</i>
<i>she packed everything we had in our car... </i>

89
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,066
<i>and told us we were going West</i>
<i>for a fresh start. </i>

90
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,876
<i>Our dad was never around much anyway,</i>
<i>so after those first 1,500 miles... </i>

91
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,547
<i>me and Bobby just forgot all about him. </i>

92
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,915
<i>And Mom, well... </i>

93
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,584
<i>Mom pretended like she did. </i>

94
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,987
<i>By that time,</i>
<i>I knew that I would never see him again... </i>

95
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,293
<i>and that now I was the man of the family. </i>

96
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,362
Go west, young mom. Go right, Mom.

97
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,603
- Bobby. It's lethal.
- I didn't do it.

98
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,107
- Mikey!
- Wait a minute. I didn't do it.

99
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,483
It's that dog. It's deadly! Come on.

100
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,617
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

101
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,956
It doesn't help that much.

102
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,207
"Want to know more about the Old West?

103
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,037
"Exit one-half mile ahead to see the best.

104
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,606
"Just mosey on in Geronimo Bill's
Buffalo Farm and Wild West Adventure. "

105
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,015
Can we go, Mom? Please!

106
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,155
<i>Except for the giant dinosaur in Missouri... </i>

107
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,421
<i>that they had turned into a hamburger stand</i>
<i>when it died... </i>

108
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:53,022
<i>what we saw in Oklahoma</i>
<i>was the greatest thing we'd ever seen. </i>

109
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,995
Thanks a lot, Mom.

110
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,805
- Can we please stay the whole day?
- Yeah, please?

111
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,570
- How many buffalo do you think they have?
- I bet there's millions.

112
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,945
Keep your eye on that dog, Eugene.

113
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,924
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

114
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,586
Welcome to
the Geronimo Bill Buffalo Farm...

115
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,096
and Wild Adventure Souvenir Shop.

116
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,362
That'll be three for 75¢, ma'am.

117
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:36,941
Would it be okay if I just set them up
on the fence so they could see the buffalo?

118
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,640
Well, ma'am, today is your lucky day.

119
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,443
You see, it's Free Admission Day
for all folks from out of town.

120
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,453
Hey, we're from Jersey.

121
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,281
That don't make y'all bad.

122
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,455
So you go on in,
stick to the path, and enjoy yourself.

123
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,656
- All right!
- Man, look at that.

124
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,335
Come on. Mom can't afford that.

125
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,340
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks for coming.

126
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,517
Okay, troops. Keep your eyes on the buffalo.

127
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,544
- Go ahead, Mom.
- Thank you.

128
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,921
Don't let your dog get my buffalo, son.

129
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,427
Thank you.

130
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,174
Wow! Look at...

131
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,141
He's huge.

132
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,670
He's huge, Mom.

133
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,275
- Bobby, look at him.
- Isn't he beautiful?

134
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,710
Look at that.

135
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,552
But where are the other ones?

136
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,492
Think he's the only buffalo left in the world?

137
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,892
Maybe he is.

138
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,659
Oh, gosh, Mom.

139
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,637
- He looks lonely.
- I'm sure he is.

140
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,868
Mom, what's gonna happen to him?

141
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,005
- It's so sad.
- Why?

142
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,544
I don't know, Mikey. I guess
that's what happens when you're alone.

143
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,821
There's lots more to see. Come on.

144
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,372
You boys take care of your mom now,
you hear?

145
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,271
<i>We promised we would. </i>

146
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,035
<i>We never broke that promise. </i>

147
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,859
Fuck.

148
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,094
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,870
I didn't mean... It was an accident.

150
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,734
Somebody give me some soap.
I'll do it myself.

151
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:07,084
<i>Finally, after 22 jars of peanut butter,</i>
<i>and just as Mom ran out of money... </i>

152
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,281
<i>we made it to the apartment</i>
<i>of an aunt we didn't even know we had. </i>

153
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,347
- I'm driving.
- It's too low, Mom.

154
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:16,121
- It's not too low.
- Yes, it is. Not that one. This one.

155
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,691
Michael, I told you to tie it on tighter.

156
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,868
You broke my bike!

157
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,901
Oh, my God, they're here! Mary!

158
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,445
Lois, hi! How are you?

159
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,676
You got here. Bill, honey, they're here.

160
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,618
This is Bobby and this is Mikey!

161
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,416
- Hi, Bobby.
- How you doing?

162
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,150
- Mikey.
- Who's the dog?

163
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,421
And this is Shane.
Don't worry, he's housebroken.

164
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,492
- But they're not.
- Mom!

165
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,867
<i>As it turned out,</i>
<i>we didn't have to stay there too long... </i>

166
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,839
<i>because about a month after we got there,</i>
<i>he entered our lives. </i>

167
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,274
Oh, Jack.

168
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,712
<i>Mom liked him right away. </i>

169
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,212
<i>After she'd known him for a while... </i>

170
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,683
<i>she said that he was the answer</i>
<i>to all her prayers. </i>

171
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,051
I want those two top cards. Keep me in.

172
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,624
You guys remember what I told you.
Cover up.

173
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,353
- Okay.
- All right.

174
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,661
<i>We called him The King,</i>
<i>because that's what he liked to be called. </i>

175
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,969
- Here's a cold one.
- Thanks, Mom.

176
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,499
- That looks good.
- He's fixing the bike you broke, Mom.

177
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,473
Come on, Bobby, blow! Make a wish!

178
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,643
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Blow, Bobby.

179
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,980
All right, Bobby!

180
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,388
Wow, a Radio Flyer!

181
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,462
- Wow.
- Do you like it?

182
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,794
- Yeah, thanks, Mom.
- You do?

183
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,928
- I thought you would like it.
- I love it.

184
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,906
Happy birthday, Bobby.

185
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,199
<i>It was at a carnival where, for the first time... </i>

186
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,298
<i>I knew there was something different</i>
<i>about my brother. </i>

187
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,413
<i>I could tell by the look in his eyes that night</i>
<i>that he knew... </i>

188
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:54,381
<i>about a special, secret thing</i>
<i>that all kids know. </i>

189
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,620
<i>Only, he knew more. </i>

190
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,280
<i>A lot more. </i>

191
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,535
Here you go. Yeah, that's right.

192
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,202
Okay, look. See this? You close that up.

193
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,037
- It's just like a safety pin.
- That's it.

194
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,770
Okay, pick that up.
Let me cast it out there for you.

195
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:25,340
You wanna bring it back.
Let it go at about one o'clock. Bingo!

196
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,746
That was far.

197
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,720
- Not bad, huh?
- That's a good cast.

198
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,380
Here you go. Whose turn is it?

199
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,550
- It's Bobby's.
- Okay, here you go.

200
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,753
- Here we go. You're gonna catch a big one.
- All right.

201
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,766
Reel it in, but don't pull too hard now.

202
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,118
- You got one!
- I got one!

203
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,620
- Wow!
- Reel it in!

204
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,122
Come on, hurry. Push it and pull.

205
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,557
- It's a honker!
- Reel it in slow. Nice and easy.

206
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,221
- Don't pull too hard.
- I got it.

207
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,093
- Easy.
- Come on, reel it in.

208
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,794
- Reel it in. Here.
- Reel it in nice and easy. Come on!

209
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,995
- Don't pull so hard. You bent it too much.
- Darn.

210
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,335
God damn it, Bobby!

211
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,711
What the hell's the matter with you?
I told you not to pull so hard, didn't I?

212
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,073
What's the matter? You deaf or just stupid?

213
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,846
Hey, I'm talking to you. Listen to me.

214
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,421
Knock it off, or I'll really give you
something to cry about.

215
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,285
That was a $5 lure, for Christ's sake.

216
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,376
All right. Here.

217
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,408
Here, use mine.

218
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,615
I'll set you up with a new lure on this one.

219
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,517
Remember, the good fish wait for no man,
all right?

220
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,857
<i>We never told Mom about that day. </i>

221
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>And that bothered me a lot. </i>

222
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,060
Comb that hair back for you.

223
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,370
Get you to look like a real man here. Okay.

224
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,237
Look at you. Look at this hair.

225
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,876
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

226
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,356
<i>In the summer of 1969,</i>
<i>we moved to the suburbs... </i>

227
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,527
<i>where everybody had a house, a car,</i>
<i>and two-and-a-half kids. </i>

228
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,032
<i>So we figured we fit in really good... </i>

229
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,197
<i>because with Shane,</i>
<i>that's exactly what we were. </i>

230
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,675
Check this out. Hi! Ask who they are.

231
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,374
- Hey, who are you?
- Yeah, who are you?

232
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,038
Who's that?

233
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,243
<i>But The King bought the house</i>
<i>from a family named the Marshals. </i>

234
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,845
<i>And there were two boys about our ages</i>
<i>living in it when it got sold. </i>

235
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,221
They kicked out the Marshals?
Hey, they kicked out the Marshals.

236
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,886
<i>Me and Bobby never kicked anyone</i>
<i>out of anywhere. </i>

237
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,898
<i>But for some reason, the rest of the kids</i>
<i>on the block always said we did. </i>

238
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,060
Come on, out of the way.

239
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,928
We need the key.

240
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,134
Yes, the key! Watch out, Shane.

241
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,334
Give me a kiss. I love you guys.

242
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,446
<i>It was there, when all of Mom's prayers</i>
<i>were just about answered... </i>

243
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:55,321
<i>when everything seemed like it would be</i>
<i>happy and good for the rest of our lives... </i>

244
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,719
<i>that it really all began. </i>

245
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,367
It's official now. Sold.

246
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,305
- It's official now.
- Great, Jack. It's official.

247
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,536
Yes, it's ours!

248
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,447
Hi, welcome to the neighborhood.
How y'all doing?

249
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,517
- Come on, let's go.
- Hi.

250
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,494
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

251
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,260
- What's your name?
- I'm Mike and that's Bobby.

252
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,500
- This is our dog, Shane.
- Hi, how do you do?

253
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,767
- I'm Jim Daugherty from the Sheriff's office.
- Hi, I'm Mary Mackenzie.

254
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,887
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

255
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,382
Mom, can me and Bobby go exploring?

256
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,329
Is your room put away?

257
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,294
- We'll check.
- That's what I thought.

258
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,245
- Mike, get me out of here.
- Get out.

259
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,148
Come on, let's go!

260
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,050
We checked. It's clean.

261
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,955
Are you kidding me?
You've only been in there for 27 seconds.

262
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,586
Mikey, Bobby, come on.

263
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,826
All right!

264
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,591
Don't scratch it.

265
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,833
- Wow!
- I bet there's some secret entrances.

266
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,268
The Marshall kids
must have built it as a fort.

267
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,203
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

268
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,337
Come on, Bobby. This must be it.

269
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,620
Shane, don't go in there! No!

270
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,759
It's a turtle.

271
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,832
That's what I was going to say.

272
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,430
Look at that chain.

273
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,532
He must have busted it
and climbed into the clubhouse.

274
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,271
- We gotta name him.
- Yeah, but what?

275
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,816
- Good one, Shane. Samson.
- Samson? Why?

276
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,588
Hey, stay back.
'Cause he was so strong to break the chain.

277
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,854
Yeah, great! Samson. Welcome to the family.

278
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,791
Back in your old home, Samson.

279
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,358
Carefully put him down. Ready?
One, two, three.

280
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,601
What's that?

281
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,871
Look at this, Bobby.

282
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,241
This board's loose.

283
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,284
It's a coffee can.

284
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,684
- Nothing in here. Wait.
- It's a bank.

285
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,457
Nothing else under here
but a bunch of spiders.

286
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,957
Darn, it's empty.
Bobby, we can stash money in this thing.

287
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,469
- Don't tell anybody about this, okay?
- I swear. Pinkie promise.

288
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,819
I'm telling you,
you're not supposed to pick your nose.

289
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,789
Your brains will fall out.

290
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,848
- Will not.
- Will so.

291
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,323
You'll make a hole in your head
and your brains will fall out.

292
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,263
- Will not.
- Yeah? Let's go ask Mom.

293
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,234
- Okay, let's ask her.
- Fine.

294
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,539
- Mom, the room's clean.
- Clothes are washed and folded.

295
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,580
- Fed Samson and Shane.
- Picked the poop up.

296
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,979
- And the grass is watered.
- Okay.

297
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,984
- Guys.
- Yes, Mom?

298
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,045
I want you to be back here
before your dad gets home.

299
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,523
And I have to work double shifts
all summer long...

300
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,426
- so I don't want you out too late.
- Okay.

301
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,457
Guys.

302
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,130
Yes, Mom, what is it?

303
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,799
Nothing.

304
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,339
I love you.

305
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,375
We love you, too, Mom.

306
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,044
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi!

307
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,188
<i>Before anybody ever grows up,</i>
<i>there are magical things... </i>

308
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,593
<i>impossible for adults, that can still happen. </i>

309
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,292
<i>The reason these things</i>
<i>are lost to the grown-up world is simple. </i>

310
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,734
<i>In the quick second between the age of 12</i>
<i>and your 13th birthday... </i>

311
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,533
<i>the great secrets to them all</i>
<i>are replaced in your mind... </i>

312
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,870
<i>with thoughts of the opposite sex. </i>

313
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,839
- Say, "Uncle. "
- Uncle.

314
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,143
- Give?
- Uncle.

315
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,516
<i>There are seven of these lost</i>
<i>secret fascinations and abilities. </i>

316
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,648
<i>They are: That animals can talk. </i>

317
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,494
<i>Your favorite blanket</i>
<i>is woven from a fabric so mighty... </i>

318
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,796
<i>that once pulled over your head,</i>
<i>it becomes an impenetrable force field. </i>

319
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,800
Great.

320
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,599
<i>Nothing is too heavy to lift,</i>
<i>with the aid of a cape. </i>

321
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,141
Mikey, you did it. Wow!

322
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:28,414
<i>Your hand, held forefinger out</i>
<i>and thumbs up, actually fires bullets. </i>

323
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,481
Hurry.

324
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,998
<i>Jumping from any height with an umbrella</i>
<i>is completely safe. </i>

325
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,363
You okay?

326
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,371
I did it, Mike. I flew.

327
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:56,805
<i>Monsters exist,</i>
<i>that can both be seen and done battle with. </i>

328
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,906
One, two, three!

329
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,792
<i>And the greatest,</i>
<i>most special and regrettable loss of all:</i>

330
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,194
<i>The ability to fly. </i>

331
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,701
<i>From what we'd heard around</i>
<i>about that kid Fisher... </i>

332
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,438
<i>and what he'd done 10 years</i>
<i>before we'd moved into the neighborhood... </i>

333
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,446
<i>we knew the second we saw it. </i>

334
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,414
That must be the place.

335
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,710
Truly. Could be killed.

336
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,717
<i>That's why they called that kid Fisher</i>
<i>a legend... </i>

337
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,187
<i>because he did the greatest thing</i>
<i>anybody's ever heard of. </i>

338
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,654
- He wasn't that great.
- What do you mean?

339
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,958
- He got killed, didn't he?
- No, he didn't.

340
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,658
- Yeah, he did.
- No, he didn't.

341
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,190
Yeah, he did. Look at that jump.
You know, at the barn?

342
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,296
It's a long way down, probably 2 miles.

343
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,665
Probably did a good try.

344
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,375
He just did it wrong.

345
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,607
- We should do an expedition up there.
- Yeah, it's probably cool up there.

346
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,112
- Not today, though.
- Yeah, not today.

347
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,814
Nah, too busy.

348
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,619
We will...

349
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,120
later.

350
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,732
Please, help.

351
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,370
Stop.

352
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,810
Please, don't. Help.

353
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,858
No, don't! Please stop.

354
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,729
- No, don't do it! Stop.
- Oh, my God. Bobby.

355
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,528
Bobby, it's me.

356
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,636
It's me, Bobby.

357
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,808
What happened to your back?

358
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,147
Oh, God.

359
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,882
Don't you ever tell Mom, Mike.

360
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,048
Don't you ever.

361
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,925
- Promise?
- I promise.

362
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,228
What was the dream?

363
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,001
What was the nightmare about?

364
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,401
- You swear you won't tell Mom?
- Yeah.

365
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,945
The King, he was chasing me
and I couldn't get away.

366
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,617
Did he do that to your back?

367
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

368
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,460
I was afraid you'd tell Mom.
She's happy now.

369
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:07,231
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>I realized that Bobby was my responsibility. </i>

370
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,503
<i>I had to think up some way to help him. </i>

371
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,614
<i>I made sure we left our house</i>
<i>when the sun came up... </i>

372
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,281
<i>and we never went home till just after dark. </i>

373
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,285
<i>That way,</i>
<i>Bobby could avoid The King all day. </i>

374
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,856
<i>So we spent all our time expeditioning. </i>

375
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,192
Come on.

376
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,130
Come here, frog.

377
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,137
- Okay, we got one.
- We got two, you mean.

378
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,201
- Open it for me, will you?
- Okay.

379
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,188
<i>We knew we were in trouble instantly... </i>

380
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:09,290
<i>the way kids know they're in for it</i>
<i>when bigger kids appear in front of them. </i>

381
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,963
<i>It's a sixth sense that you never lose. </i>
<i>And we knew we were as good as dead. </i>

382
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,097
You're dead. You're both dead.

383
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,916
- Frogs?
- We're the only ones who can catch frogs.

384
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,584
Yeah, you need Victor's permission
to go in the pipe.

385
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,095
You need Victor's permission
for everything around here, sissies.

386
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,220
It ain't your pipe.

387
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,696
You're both dead.

388
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,534
All right. Tell your mutt to stay there, man.

389
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,506
He ain't a mutt.
He's a killer German shepherd attack dog.

390
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,066
And if you move any closer, he'll kill you.

391
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,243
Just tell him to cool down.
Tell him to stay there, all right?

392
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,045
- Say, "Please. "
- Say, "Pretty please. "

393
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,442
- Kiss my butt.
- Yeah.

394
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,654
Okay, Shane. Kill!

395
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,460
You're dead meat. Dead as a doornail.

396
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,725
Good boy, Shane. Good going.

397
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,061
Come on.

398
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,707
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mom.

399
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,300
What's cooking?

400
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,212
Guys, who stepped in what here?

401
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,314
- It wasn't me.
- Me, either.

402
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,218
- Where were you?
- We were exploring.

403
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,950
- Where?
- Sewers.

404
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,386
That is just disgusting!

405
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,424
It's perfect. Okay, come on. Big boys first.

406
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,561
- Mom, I can do it myself.
- I'll help you. You're first.

407
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,663
- I can do it myself.
- Come on.

408
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,208
You guys are nuts!

409
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,339
I have no time for games.
I have to go to work.

410
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,707
I can't believe you guys!

411
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,417
Finish your baths.
All filthy clothes in the wash.

412
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,149
I'm going to work.

413
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,325
Thanks, Mike.

414
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,339
Hi, honey. Good night. Goodbye. I love you.

415
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,503
It's coming down.

416
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,765
I know.

417
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,989
<i>It's alive. He's moving. He's alive. </i>

418
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,162
<i>It's alive!</i>

419
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,833
<i>In the name of God!</i>

420
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,719
What are you doing up? Go to bed.

421
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,755
Not you. Bobby, come here.
Mikey, you go to bed.

422
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,420
- Bobby, come here.
- But I want to...

423
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,431
Go to bed! Come here, Bobby.

424
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,065
Come here!

425
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,006
What did I tell you?
Why don't you listen to me?

426
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,308
Why don't you ever listen
to what I'm telling you to do?

427
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,452
Get to bed, you little son of a bitch!

428
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,325
We can't stay up so late anymore.

429
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,224
- Are you real?
- Sure.

430
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,755
Touch my nose.

431
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,660
But how did you get here?

432
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,570
The window was open.

433
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,036
Michael, it's getting worse.

434
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:42,018
Why is this happening to Bobby
and not to me?

435
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,611
Because Bobby cannot fight back.

436
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,885
But you can. You have to help him.

437
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,421
But I don't know what to do.

438
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,826
I can't tell Mom. I can't tell anyone.

439
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:59,725
- I can't break my promise to him.
- Keep your promise...

440
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,497
but listen to Bobby.

441
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,201
Bobby already has the answer.

442
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,676
It is for you to help him find it.

443
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,147
Good night, Michael.

444
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,284
Good night, Bobby.

445
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,683
Good night, buffalo.

446
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,185
<i>The dream had given me a strength... </i>

447
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,920
<i>a sudden sense of purpose. </i>

448
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,934
- Look, a house!
- Cool!

449
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,939
- You okay?
- Open her up.

450
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,217
Cool.

451
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,616
An engine!

452
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,459
Like from an airplane or a grass cutter.

453
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,129
You mean a lawn mower.

454
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,660
Yeah. Groovy.

455
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,596
But, Mike, how do we get it?

456
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,908
We don't.

457
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,642
We shouldn't, anyway.

458
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,576
Come on, Shane. It ain't ours.

459
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,979
Mike, it's been in there a million years.
The owner's probably dead.

460
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,318
Yeah, probably.
Wait a sec. What do we need it for?

461
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,734
Don't know yet.

462
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,330
What?

463
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,228
Nothing.

464
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,710
- Oh, no! The Flyer!
- Shane, get it!

465
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:01,952
- Hurry up, Mike. It's trying to get away.
- Get it, Shane!

466
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,892
Come on, Shane! Get it!

467
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,435
- Not too fast.
- Come on.

468
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,304
Would you just wait, Mike?

469
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,636
"Fisher's landing. "

470
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,610
<i>We finally got up enough nerve</i>
<i>to climb that big hill. </i>

471
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,312
<i>We called the top The Wishing Spot... </i>

472
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,445
<i>because we reasoned that God would have</i>
<i>to hear a wish made that close to heaven. </i>

473
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,117
<i>And we made a lot of wishes up there... </i>

474
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,655
<i>but mostly just one:</i>
<i>For The King to stop hitting Bobby. </i>

475
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,760
<i>Although he always started again</i>
<i>after a while... </i>

476
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,932
<i>at the times we made those wishes,</i>
<i>he always stopped. </i>

477
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,500
<i>So we knew, beyond a doubt,</i>
<i>that The Wishing Spot worked. </i>

478
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,780
<i>It was just a little too far away from heaven</i>
<i>for God to hear them all. </i>

479
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:40,383
<i>God did hear a certain wish</i>
<i>that Bobby made a thousand times up there. </i>

480
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,788
<i>And I never even knew he did. </i>

481
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:56,205
<i>One day, we discovered a part</i>
<i>of how that wish would come true. </i>

482
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,235
<i>It was in the biggest... </i>

483
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,242
...yard I've ever seen.

484
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,172
I think it's a golf course.

485
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:11,216
There can't be very many of them.
Otherwise, they'd take up the whole world.

486
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:20,457
Why are those guys hitting those balls
into the water?

487
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,056
I don't think they're doing it on purpose.

488
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,967
Shit.

489
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,634
Yeah, there must be
11 million balls out there.

490
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,943
That gives me an idea.

491
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,145
Yeah, what?

492
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,813
<i>It was money. </i>
<i>I didn't know how it was gonna help... </i>

493
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,756
<i>but I knew that we were better off</i>
<i>if we had some than if we didn't. </i>

494
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,022
Get your golf balls. 30¢ apiece.

495
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,157
Two for a quarter.

496
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,758
<i>So we collected</i>
<i>as much as we possibly could. </i>

497
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,327
I've got eight of them, guys.

498
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,774
- All right!
- $2. Money up. Here you go.

499
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,343
Thank you very much.
There you go, right there.

500
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,470
Thanks, boys.

501
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,606
- Thanks a lot.
- You bet. That's how many I lost today.

502
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,386
Sir, you want some golf balls? 30¢ apiece.

503
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,419
That's $3.

504
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,194
$4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9.

505
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,486
$9!

506
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,131
What are you doing?
That's a brand-new ball.

507
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,174
- Whose dog is that?
- It's not our dog.

508
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,012
Look, $10.

509
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,241
Put it in.

510
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,588
Wait.

511
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,396
From this time on...

512
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:09,201
Mike and Bobby, who know the contents
of the secret hiding cubbyhole place...

513
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,838
will never, ever,
even if they are tortured to death...

514
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,378
ever tell anyone who asks or don't ask...

515
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:19,078
what is inside the secret cubbyhole place,
and where it is.

516
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,175
- Pinkie promise.
- I swear. Amen.

517
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,778
Amen.

518
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,388
Thanks.

519
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,142
4, 8, 12, 14...

520
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,416
15, 16, 17, 18. Okay, boys.

521
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,654
Thanks, buddy.

522
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,266
Then it's 19.

523
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,497
- There was 19, right?
- Okay, 19.

524
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,497
Groovy!

525
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,140
That's 20, right?

526
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,293
Sorry.

527
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,747
We're millionaires!
What are we gonna get with it?

528
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,052
Nothing.

529
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,830
We can't spend any of it.

530
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,767
Promise we won't, Mike.

531
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,101
Okay, Bobby.

532
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,640
Don't worry. We won't.

533
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,183
<i>I still didn't know what Bobby knew,</i>
<i>but I felt it. </i>

534
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,487
<i>I knew that whatever</i>
<i>I wanted to spend it on... </i>

535
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,253
<i>was nothing compared to</i>
<i>what Bobby was going to need it for. </i>

536
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:53,194
<i>When we were kids, there were still</i>
<i>plenty of things to be afraid of. </i>

537
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:57,400
<i>Because, in those days, there were</i>
<i>no video games and no computers. </i>

538
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,705
<i>Monsters still existed,</i>
<i>because they hadn't yet been rounded up... </i>

539
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,905
<i>and made to live only in electronic games</i>
<i>or on floppy disks. </i>

540
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,471
...his dog. Watch it.

541
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,518
<i>Of course, Bobby and me</i>
<i>believed in all the regular monsters... </i>

542
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,019
<i>like Frankenstein and the 50 Foot Woman. </i>

543
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,147
<i>But we didn't totally fear them. </i>

544
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,817
<i>Back then, they just made movies. </i>

545
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:25,127
<i>Mostly, it was only one particular monster</i>
<i>we feared... </i>

546
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,561
<i>and we couldn't get rid of him. </i>

547
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,807
<i>The best way to be sure</i>
<i>you didn't fall prey... </i>

548
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,545
<i>to any of those ultimate bad guys... </i>

549
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,750
<i>was not to summon them into the world. </i>

550
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:46,248
<i>Was not to summon them into the world. </i>

551
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:49,950
Ouija board...

552
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,296
is there really a Bigfoot?

553
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,535
I'm not moving it. Are you?

554
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,604
You must be doing it.

555
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,036
I ain't.

556
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,054
The window.

557
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,621
- I don't believe in this stuff, do you?
- Yeah, it's just a game.

558
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,928
- Let's go check anyway.
- I don't think so, though.

559
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,603
- I don't believe in this stuff.
- Wait for me.

560
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,045
Ready? One, two, three.

561
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,750
<i>The ad promised that it was a 100%... </i>

562
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,386
<i>absolutely, positively guaranteed</i>
<i>anti-monster potion. </i>

563
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:01,224
<i>Or your money back. </i>
<i>Offer void where prohibited by law. </i>

564
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,266
- City and state.
- Novato, California.

565
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,664
Thank you.

566
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,369
Perfect. All right, let's go mail it. Come on.

567
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,980
<i>The board had told us</i>
<i>that the anti-monster potion would work... </i>

568
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:23,011
<i>but it didn't tell us that it would get there</i>
<i>just a little too late. </i>

569
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,917
Want to go to the airport today...

570
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,149
and see that plane that we saw yesterday?

571
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,657
Yeah, that was fun.

572
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,244
- Here you go, buddy.
- Thanks.

573
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,481
Let's get it in before she sees it.

574
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,024
Why did he do it, Mike?

575
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,328
Who knows?

576
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,733
Come on, let's clean this up.

577
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,863
Your new shirt.

578
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,599
It's all right.

579
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,144
Here, you hold this.

580
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,709
What is it, Shane?

581
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,445
- What's the matter, Shane?
- What you barking at?

582
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,250
Having a yard sale?

583
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,821
- Your dog can't save you now, sissies.
- That's right.

584
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,826
- Run, Bobby.
- Let's get them.

585
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,468
Get off me!

586
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,535
Let go of my brother!

587
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:58,974
Leave my brother alone!

588
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,219
I told you to leave my brother alone!

589
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,292
Hold it!

590
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,892
You okay?

591
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,964
What's going on here?

592
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,901
- We didn't do anything. They started it.
- They did?

593
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:25,102
- You're just minding your own business?
- Yeah.

594
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,837
All right, get out of here.

595
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,846
Get your bikes and go home
before I call all your parents.

596
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,404
Come on, Victor.

597
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,381
Move out! Pick it up. Come on.

598
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,582
You all right, Victor?

599
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:43,859
He told us to get our bikes. Bozo!

600
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,558
You're dead meat!

601
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,664
We're coming back!
Just wait till next time, you little pukes.

602
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,634
I'm gonna get you, Mike!

603
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,330
- You boys all right?
- Yes, sir.

604
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,501
- Are we in trouble?
- Are you in...

605
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,433
What? Come here.

606
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,008
Are you in trouble?
No, you're not in any trouble.

607
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:13,317
- Did you make this mess on the lawn?
- No.

608
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,220
If you didn't, who did?

609
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,294
I don't know.

610
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,366
- You boys need some help?
- No, sir.

611
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,235
We have to clean up now,
before he gets home.

612
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,514
Son...

613
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:53,029
- if you need me, I'll be here.
- Yeah, thanks.

614
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,367
We got it.

615
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,976
Bobby, yeah!

616
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,949
- You guys sure you'll be all right?
- Yeah, we'll be all right now.

617
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,245
Yes, sir!

618
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,584

That should do it.

635
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,277
This is disgusting.

636
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,084
There we go.

637
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,589
I gotta go to the bathroom.

638
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,186
I think I'll watch some TV.

639
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,542

<i>- Was he a fat one?</i>

640

<i>That was me!</i>

641
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,119

<i>- Stand back. </i>

642

<i>It's a bomb! Stand back. </i>

643
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,192
<i>Stand back or I'll mail you to the undertaker!</i>

644
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,439
Shut it off!

645
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,976
It didn't work!

646
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,671
Holy crap.

647
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,110
Oh, my God.

648
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:10,051
- Mike, if he gets home first...
- Maybe not.

649
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,661
Maybe Mom will get home first
and she'll help us.

650
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:19,627
Watch out!

651
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,401
That's it.

652
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,312
What are you doing?

653
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,008
We gotta save some to protect us
if he gets home first.

654
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,780
You're right. Come on, I'll give you a hand.

655
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:49,963
Out, Shane!

656
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,745
- It won't be that bad.
- Not for you.

657
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,285
I'll hide this cord. It won't be so bad.

658
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,720
For you, either.
Not if he can't find Old Trusty...

659
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,527
way in the back.

660
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,856
Think he'll find it?

661
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,433
- No way.
- Thanks, Mike.

662
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,855
<i>It was the only time</i>
<i>in our lives that we were ever glad... </i>

663
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,448
<i>that he went into the garage to get drunk. </i>

664
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,254
There's only one way he'll never find out.

665
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,593
The Wishing Spot.

666
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:58,723
Right.

667
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,838
<i>When we took Mom</i>
<i>to The Wishing Spot once... </i>

668
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:08,036
<i>she said she thought it was pretty</i>
<i>and had a nice view. </i>

669
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,673
<i>We knew that she had no idea</i>
<i>of its true power. </i>

670
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,942
<i>That day, we wished The King never find out</i>
<i>about the mess we made. </i>

671
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,745
<i>He never did. </i>

672
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,862
How come he does it? How come he drinks?

673
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,666
I guess beer means more to him than we do.

674
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,769
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

675
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,748
<i>By design, a younger brother is a tagalong. </i>

676
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,687
<i>You're a little bigger, a little stronger... </i>

677
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,453
<i>only because you were born</i>
<i>two years earlier. </i>

678
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,963
<i>So you're always looking back</i>
<i>to see if he's still there... </i>

679
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,966
<i>and always embarrassed of him</i>
<i>in front of all of your bigger friends. </i>

680
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,442
Duck, Bobby.

681
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,683
We're gonna go play some football.
Wanna come?

682
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,877
Come on, Mikey. Let's go.

683
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:27,854
- We need another player.
- Yeah, come on.

684
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,519
Let's go!

685
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,458
They're only saying...

686
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,189
Maybe not.
Maybe they want to be friends with me.

687
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:38,222
- We need an extra player. Let's go, Mikey.
- Yeah, come on.

688
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,330
You don't know. They could be cool.

689
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,172
- But...
- Just stay here, Bobby.

690
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:50,910
You're too young.

691
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:52,675
Stay here.

692
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,781
Here, you can have my Pez.

693
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,584
Mike, come on.

694
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,229
Burn out. Let's go! Burn some rubber.

695
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,158
Come on. Beat you there.

696
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,308
No, Shane.

697
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,038
Just let him go.

698
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,144
Let's go!

699
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,214
This is gonna be lots of fun
when we get there.

700
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,915
Come on, Mikey!

701
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,453
- Mike, ever played Kill the Carrier?
- Yeah, sure.

702
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,796
Sure? Okay this is how it goes:

703
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,794
Bikes are free.

704
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,959
If you get through, you're safe.

705
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:22,902
If you get there.

706
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,886
No, it's not fair!

707
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,626
Now you're bleeding, little sissy? Get up.

708
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,129
Guys, I think this is not the way we play it
where I come from.

709
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,859
Too bad. Get him, guys.

710
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,868
Damn it! Jesus Christ.

711
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,860
Where are you, Bobby?

712
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:09,833
What the hell's the matter with you?
Didn't you think I'd miss this?

713
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,642
What were thinking about,
putting that in there?

714
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,074
What's the matter with you?

715
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,642
What do I have to do to teach you, Bobby?

716
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,413
Sissy!

717
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,185
- Baby!
- Get him. He's getting away.

718
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:30,462
- Mikey, you made it.
- Cheater.

719
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:34,100
- Victor, leave him alone.
- Man, that's enough!

720
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,037
I did it!

721
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,802
You better run, damn cheater.

722
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,343
- What are you talking about?
- Got a problem with that?

723
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,672
Now it's yours.

724
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,107
All right, Mike!

725
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,908
- Get out of here, man.
- Go!

726
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,146
You should start wearing a cup.

727
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:34,422
I did it again.
I got him in the you-know-what...

728
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,816
Oh, God...

729
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,750
please make him all right.

730
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,958
Please make it that he'll be okay.

731
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,501
I'm so sorry, Shane.

732
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,243
I know I shouldn't have left him.

733
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,618
I promise I'll never leave him again.

734
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,195
Sweetheart...

735
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,038
I'm so sorry he did this to you.

736
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,704
I promise this will never happen again.

737
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,409
He's in jail.

738
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,719
It's gonna be all right, Mom.

739
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,995
Don't worry.

740
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,702
Mom, can I talk to Mike for a minute?

741
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,283
- Is Shane all right?
- Yeah.

742
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,622
Did he find the secret hiding place?

743
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,962
No, it's still there.

744
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,028
Good.

745
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,568
It won't be long now. I can feel it.

746
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:35,803
For what?

747
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,075
I can't tell you yet...

748
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,312
but it won't be long.

749
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,294
Take your man, that's it. I go.

750
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,590
One, one. I'm out. Go ahead, go.

751
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,895
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

752
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,932
- I'll get it.
- Oh, man!

753
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,529
Hello?

754
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,878
Yes, this is she.

755
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,413
No, I can't hear you. Just a minute.

756
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,655
Yes, I'll pay the charges.

757
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,534
When did it happen?

758
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,335
I see.

759
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,646
I'm sorry to hear about your mother, Jack.

760
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,146
It sounded like The King.

761
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,452
- What's he want?
- Don't know, but it was bad news.

762
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,704
I can't handle it.

763
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,236
It's okay, Mom.

764
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,584
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

765
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:27,487
It's gonna be all right. Don't cry.
Please, Mom.

766
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,357
Mom, listen.

767
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:35,857
- Mom, look.
- Stop!

768
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,698
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

769
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,571
Go to your room!

770
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,003
It's bedtime, anyway.

771
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,473
- Go to your room...
- But the sun's still out.

772
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:52,071
Please, just leave me alone. I'm sorry, boys.

773
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,115
Go to your room for now. Good night.

774
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,059
Yes.

775
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:14,636
No. They said no.

776
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,098
They said
they're going to repossess your truck.

777
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:21,665
You haven't paid up in the last two weeks,
they don't care.

778
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,779
I don't know.

779
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:33,919
I have to go now.

780
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,453
He's coming back, Mike.

781
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,259
It's not Mom's fault...

782
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,130
but he's coming back.

783
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,066
<i>Fire!</i>

784
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,376
I could be one of those girls.

785
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:02,349
- No, you're prettier than them, Mom.
- I bet they make more money.

786
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,218
I'm sure they do. They're on television.

787
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,216
- I got it.
- I'll get it.

788
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,690
Hi.

789
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:42,450
I got you a couple of presents. I'm sorry.

790
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:01,476
I think you boys
should go to your rooms, okay?

791
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,444
God, I'm sorry, Mary. I'm so sorry.

792
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,655
<i>Mom had said he was never coming back. </i>

793
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:21,821
<i>But here he was,</i>
<i>bringing presents, saying he was sorry. </i>

794
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,531
<i>We thought he was in jail,</i>
<i>but he'd got out on a temporary release... </i>

795
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,036
<i>so he could attend his mother's funeral. </i>

796
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:31,839
<i>We heard him cry... </i>

797
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,866
<i>tell Mom that he had changed... </i>

798
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,679
<i>that he would never drink again,</i>
<i>that he was sorry... </i>

799
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,474
<i>that he loved us... </i>

800
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,845
<i>and especially her. </i>

801
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,957
<i>We knew that it was not just the drinking</i>
<i>that had caused him to act the way he had... </i>

802
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:52,357
<i>but we'd never heard a man cry before. </i>

803
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,991
<i>It shocked us. </i>

804
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,826
<i>We guess that it shocked Mom, too. </i>

805
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,964
<i>We knew that she still needed him. </i>

806
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,233
<i>We were too young then to understand... </i>

807
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,176
<i>about how a man and a woman</i>
<i>loved one another. </i>

808
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:11,941
<i>How because of that love... </i>

809
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:16,576
<i>they can believe all sorts of things</i>
<i>about the other person that are just not true. </i>

810
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,019
<i>But we did understand... </i>

811
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:23,114
<i>that Mom was faced with about</i>
<i>the hardest decision she ever had to make. </i>

812
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,880
Don't get any on you, now.

813
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,120
Two for us, please.

814
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,018
- How many?
- Two, please.

815
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:00,656
Thank you.

816
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,997
<i>While I watched Sinbad do battle... </i>

817
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:10,869
<i>with the massive, irate, two-headed chicken</i>
<i>of Colossa Island... </i>

818
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:16,434
<i>my mind started putting together</i>
<i>all the things we discovered that summer. </i>

819
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,408
<i>You see, in those days... </i>

820
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,473
<i>because they never made you leave</i>
<i>after the movies were over... </i>

821
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,120
<i>we saw two movies 12 times. </i>

822
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:51,873
He made it. Yes.

823
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,241
<i>It's fantastic!</i>

824
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:07,155
<i>It was then, during the tenth show... </i>

825
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:11,232
<i>when I saw that look</i>
<i>in Bobby's eyes again... </i>

826
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:16,260
<i>that I got the greatest, scariest, biggest... </i>

827
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,064
<i>most dangerous and incredible idea... </i>

828
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:23,305
<i>any kid, in the history of all time, ever got. </i>

829
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,443
<i>That's when I got... </i>

830
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,851
"The Big Idea. " That's what I'm calling it...

831
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,650
because it's so huge and dangerous.

832
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,521
Who was the greatest flyer of all time?

833
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,431
The Red Baron, of course. Why?

834
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,035
What color is it?

835
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,934
- Red.
- What's it say on the side?

836
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,736
"Radio flyer. "

837
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:02,245
- Flyer?
- Radio flyer.

838
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,778
Thanks, Mike.

839
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,803
Told you it wouldn't be long.

840
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,169
It's all for the Big Idea.

841
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:34,807
These struts have to be stronger.

842
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,675
Is the tail as big as that one?

843
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,784
- Up here?
- Okay.

844
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,622
Don't forget the top support.

845
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,825
See, that's the main support,
the Cox motors.

846
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:52,965
<i>Using The King's tools was suicide. </i>

847
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,896
<i>He'd kill us just for touching them. </i>

848
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,263
<i>Besides that, he could be coming home</i>
<i>at any minute. </i>

849
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,274
Where's the bikes?

850
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:11,984
Got it.

851
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,088
Be careful. Don't just put it there.

852
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,424
$5, right there. Thanks.

853
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:22,986
Thanks!

854
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,557
Thanks a lot.

855
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,631
- Hey, cool.
- All right!

856
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,835
Look at this one.

857
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,877
<i>It turned out that the guy who owned</i>
<i>the lawn mower engine was dead. </i>

858
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,048
<i>So it wasn't like stealing or anything. </i>

859
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:52,958
<i>We just claimed it</i>
<i>in the name of the United States of America. </i>

860
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,631
Come on, Shane, hurry up.

861
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,468
Not too fast.

862
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:05,767
Slow down, will you?

863
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:12,742
- Okay, I think it's gonna make it.
- Come on.

864
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,981
Start.

865
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,218
All right. I'll get the propeller.

866
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,948
Okay, come on.

867
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,728
All right, it's gonna work.

868
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:30,763
Let her rip.

869
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,495
It ain't as easy as it looks.

870
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,433
Damn thing. Come on.

871
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,376
- Okay.
- It's going!

872
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,711
It stopped again.

873
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,212
- It's balanced.
- Keep it steady.

874
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,752
- Start.
- Darn.

875
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,862
- Come on!
- Damn.

876
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,023
Go!

877
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:12,703
Start the Cox.

878
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,276
Groovy, yes! It works.

879
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,379
- You got it.
- It's gotta go.

880
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,819
It's still going.

881
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,788
- It's going.
- I think it's gonna make it!

882
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,552
It's gonna make it!

883
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:35,688
It's not stopping. All right, Bobby!

884
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,554
Yes!

885
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,025
<i>It took six days to build the Flyer. </i>

886
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,328
Okay, let's close her up.

887
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,974
<i>But on the seventh day, we were done. </i>

888
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,211
<i>So we planned to go in two days. </i>

889
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,115
Good morning, Shane.

890
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,425
Hurry.

891
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:14,128
Shane, get them! Go.

892
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,137
Come on, hurry!

893
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,214
Watch out, dude! We'll get you.

894
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:31,341
They're trying to bust into the clubhouse.

895
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:37,925
- Good morning, boys.
- There's no milk.

896
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:41,824
- Use some orange juice.
- I don't like orange juice.

897
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:48,060
Boys, tell me, what happened out back?

898
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:53,504
Nothing. Some kids wanted
to get into the clubhouse, that's all.

899
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:56,375
Why did they want to get in there?

900
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,675
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

901
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:03,548
Could it have anything to do
with what you're building in there?

902
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,746
Look, don't worry. I didn't peek.

903
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,785
I don't know what's going on in there.

904
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,453
Just that if it's difficult
and you need a hand...

905
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:17,096
maybe you could wait
until your dad gets back...

906
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,429
It's okay. We don't need any help.

907
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,434
Guys, come here a sec.

908
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,438
I want to talk to you.

909
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,144
It's gonna be different, you know.

910
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,084
Everything's gonna be okay.

911
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,848
I promise. I wish you'd please believe me.

912
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,956
We believe you, Mom.

913
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,128
We do.

914
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:57,905
Don't be late for school,
and don't forget your lunch.

915
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,675
Mom.

916
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,905
I love you, Mom.

917
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,908
I love you, too, sweetheart.

918
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:46,887
<i>We had worked as fast as we could... </i>

919
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,119
<i>but it wasn't fast enough. </i>

920
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,720
<i>The King came home two days early... </i>

921
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:56,320
<i>before even Mom expected him back. </i>

922
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:05,870
They took my side views.

923
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:08,601
Damn it! God damn it!

924
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,145
My stomach hurts.

925
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,755
- Why don't you throw out your sandwich?
- Okay.

926
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,936
Mine doesn't feel good, either.

927
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,523
- Can we run home?
- Okay.

928
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,557
- We should go home, Mike.
- But we gotta get...

929
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:11,264
No, something is wrong. My stomach hurts.
We should go home right now.

930
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:16,567
Yeah, you're right.
My pain is getting worse, too.

931
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:13,365
Where are you, Shane?

932
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:33,144
Oh, my God!

933
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,732
Hey, you guys...

934
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,601
don't ever touch my tools again.

935
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,570
Put those side views back on my bike.

936
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,711
- Is he okay?
- He's alive.

937
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,214
Bobby, you have to go tonight.

938
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:38,015
I know. He's coming with me.

939
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:44,289
<i>Shane had risked his life</i>
<i>to stop The King from finding the Flyer. </i>

940
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:47,784
<i>It was only right</i>
<i>that he go with Bobby that night. </i>

941
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,258
<i>Dear Mom... </i>

942
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:55,734
<i>me and Bobby went to The Wishing Spot</i>
<i>with the Radio Flyer. </i>

943
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:00,339
<i>I will be back, but Bobby... </i>

944
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:05,873
<i>won't. </i>

945
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,111
<i>Please don't get mad. </i>

946
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,646
<i>We took Samson and Shane, too. </i>

947
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,481
<i>Your son, Mike. </i>

948
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:16,153
Okay.

949
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,772
6:45. Let's go.

950
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,277
<i>No other kids in the history of the world... </i>

951
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,290
<i>had ever had a better idea. </i>

952
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,891
<i>And if they did, they never built it. </i>

953
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:37,003
<i>The Radio Flyer was going to soar. </i>

954
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,104
<i>Suddenly it became clear to me... </i>

955
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:44,701
<i>why Bobby always got those faraway looks</i>
<i>in his eyes... </i>

956
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,270
<i>whenever he looked at the Radio Flyer. </i>

957
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,380
<i>He had known something I didn't. </i>

958
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,379
<i>He had known the true potential</i>
<i>of the wagon. </i>

959
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:59,051
<i>He could see right through the metal of it</i>
<i>and imagine the way it should have been. </i>

960
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:05,065
<i>See, it wasn't just the bright red paint,</i>
<i>or the logo that was written on it... </i>

961
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:08,591
<i>so it looked like the words were gonna fly</i>
<i>right off the sides. </i>

962
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,904
<i>It was what the wagon represented. </i>

963
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:15,638
<i>It meant escape. </i>

964
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,807
<i>Who The King of terrors couldn't see... </i>

965
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:23,816
<i>who he couldn't look into the soul of... </i>

966
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:26,647
<i>and who he couldn't get his hands on... </i>

967
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:28,378
<i>he couldn't hurt. </i>

968
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,589
<i>Bobby was going away... </i>

969
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:35,624
<i>to faraway places</i>
<i>where The King could never hurt him again. </i>

970
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,522
<i>That was what the Flyer was for. </i>

971
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:45,032
<i>And that pretty much was the Big Idea. </i>

972
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,621
God damn it!

973
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:43,624
- Fill her up, please.
- With Super.

974
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,085
If there's anything left of her
halfway down...

975
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:16,521
you got a chance.

976
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:23,828
At the bottom, just before you grab air...

977
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:27,635
ease off. Don't pull up. You'll stall out.

978
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:30,904
The angle's too great.

979
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,577
You got it?

980
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:00,872
Here.

981
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:20,520
Fish, telephone.

982
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:44,041
Good luck, kid.

983
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:07,370
<i>Fisher's flight had been doomed</i>
<i>from the beginning... </i>

984
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:10,239
<i>because he tried it way after</i>
<i>he lost all the knowledge... </i>

985
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,939
<i>of the seven great abilities and fascinations. </i>

986
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:16,048
<i>You see, he was 14.</i>

987
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,983
Here you go. This one's on the house.

988
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:23,622
Pick it up, Shirley.

989
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:26,421
It's kind of slow.
Why don't one of you go home?

990
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,887
- I'll stay.
- Yeah. Thanks.

991
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,690
Groovy.

992
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:36,600
- It's been swell.
- Good night, Mary.

993
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:07,330
She's beautiful.

994
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:12,596
She's amazing.

995
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:42,459
I told those guys to stay off of that hill.

996
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,966
Too risky. Better wait till they all take off.

997
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:32,516
What's going on here?

998
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:36,517
Answer me. I'm home. Hello?

999
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:44,194
Come on.

1000
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:54,301
<i>Dear Mom, me and Bobby went to</i>
<i>The Wishing Spot with the Radio Flyer. </i>

1001
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:58,038
<i>I will be back, but Bobby won't. </i>
<i>Please don't get mad. </i>

1002
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:02,246
<i>We took Samson and Shane, too. </i>
<i>Your son, Mike. </i>

1003
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:12,083
That's one, Bobby.
There's only two more to go.

1004
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,555
You gotta get ready. Come on.

1005
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:20,726
You promised me!

1006
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:33,174
There's stamps in there
for you to send me the postcards.

1007
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:36,011
- You'd better send them to us.
- Thanks, Mike.

1008
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:42,984
Damn that music!

1009
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:53,496
Please, I need to speak to Officer Daugherty
right away.

1010
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,739
What are you doing?

1011
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,768
No, Mike, that's your favorite jacket.

1012
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,202
Come on.

1013
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:09,681
It's yours now. You gotta keep warm.

1014
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,841
I want to go, too. I want to go.

1015
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:40,870
You can't. You gotta stay home
and take care of Mom.

1016
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,284
Bobby, I'm gonna miss you.

1017
01:38:47,488 --> 01:38:49,752
I wanna be with you.

1018
01:38:55,863 --> 01:38:57,490
You gotta get ready.

1019
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:09,440
So long, Shane. I love you.
Take care of Bobby.

1020
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:19,817
Samson, be a good turtle. Have a good ride.

1021
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:29,528
Mike, the third one took off. We gotta go.

1022
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,837
Hang on, Bobby.
I'm gonna get that rock out.

1023
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:45,169
Come on! I can't get this thing loose.

1024
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:48,945
Come on!

1025
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:52,645
You little son of a bitch!

1026
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:05,526
Free the wheel.

1027
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,701
Hang on, Bobby!

1028
01:40:15,776 --> 01:40:17,539
Start it, Mike!

1029
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:20,913
Hang on!

1030
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:23,206
- I got it!
- Pull the cord!

1031
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,046
- I got it!
- I love you, Mike.

1032
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,519
I love you, Bobby.

1033
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:54,277
Mike, I'm in the slot. Do you read me?

1034
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:00,319
- Can you hear me?
<i>- I'm in the slot, Mike!</i>

1035
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:31,107
Mike, I'm falling. She's going down.

1036
01:41:31,952 --> 01:41:33,317
<i>Do you read me?</i>

1037
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:35,252
<i>Listen to me. The Cox engines. </i>

1038
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:38,450
The auxiliaries, the thing above your head.
Pull it, now!

1039
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,868
<i>Mike, I'm flying!</i>

1040
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:55,466
He's flying. You're flying, Bobby. I knew it.

1041
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:01,373
<i>I'm trying to turn her, Mike,</i>
<i>but there's a lot of wind. </i>

1042
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:05,175
Bobby, I see you.
You're right over the airport.

1043
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:09,212
<i>Mike, can you hear me?</i>

1044
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:12,956
<i>Take care of Shane. Take care of Mom. </i>

1045
01:42:14,027 --> 01:42:16,928
<i>Goodbye, Mike. I love you. </i>

1046
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,323
Goodbye, Bob.

1047
01:42:56,103 --> 01:42:57,263
There.

1048
01:43:05,445 --> 01:43:06,912
Where's Bobby?

1049
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:18,013
You're done.

1050
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:22,128
Mikey, where's Bobby?

1051
01:43:23,463 --> 01:43:25,522
- Mike, where's your brother?
- Mom.

1052
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:31,729
What? Michael, where is he?

1053
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:37,099
He made it, Mom.

1054
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:39,608
What are you talking about?

1055
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:42,111
He's gone, Mom.

1056
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:49,350
Where is he?

1057
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:52,821
Like Bobby said, it's gonna be okay now.

1058
01:43:53,694 --> 01:43:55,059
He's safe.

1059
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:58,497
He's okay now.

1060
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:14,244
<i>However many times I tried</i>
<i>explaining to Mom what had happened... </i>

1061
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:19,078
<i>being grown up, she could never recapture</i>
<i>the frame of mind needed to understand. </i>

1062
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:23,481
<i>But being our mom,</i>
<i>she never stopped looking. </i>

1063
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:28,791
<i>Never, that is,</i>
<i>until the day I ran home from school... </i>

1064
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:31,797
<i>and all her fears and worries</i>
<i>were laid to rest. </i>

1065
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:36,159
<i>The day I got the first postcard. </i>

1066
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,904
Mom, look!

1067
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,019
It came, Mom.

1068
01:44:57,391 --> 01:44:59,916
<i>Dear Mom and Mike, I am fine. </i>

1069
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:03,360
<i>I hope you are, too. The Flyer works great. </i>

1070
01:45:03,864 --> 01:45:08,062
<i>I scared the buffalo, flying too low. </i>
<i>But Geronimo Bill was nice. </i>

1071
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,299
<i>I love you. Bobby. </i>

1072
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:23,745
I told you, Mom. I told you he'd write.

1073
01:45:29,423 --> 01:45:32,688
<i>Time passed, and I grew up,</i>
<i>and I went to college. </i>

1074
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:37,658
<i>But I never completely lost all knowledge</i>
<i>of the seven great abilities and fascinations. </i>

1075
01:45:38,231 --> 01:45:40,859
<i>Every time I felt them slipping away... </i>

1076
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:43,202
<i>I got another postcard. </i>

1077
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:46,065
<i>Bobby traveled all over the world... </i>

1078
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:49,597
<i>and visited places we dreamed</i>
<i>about visiting when we were kids. </i>

1079
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:53,143
<i>You see, in time, he grew up to be... </i>

1080
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:55,811
<i>exactly what he was born to be:</i>

1081
01:45:57,551 --> 01:45:58,950
<i>A flyer. </i>

1082
01:46:25,846 --> 01:46:30,613
Do you guys understand what I meant about
history being in the mind of the teller now?

1083
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:32,544
I think so.

1084
01:46:34,254 --> 01:46:35,448
Good.

1085
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:39,624
'Cause that's how I remember him.

1086
01:46:42,996 --> 01:46:45,157
Dad, can we ask you a question?

1087
01:46:46,433 --> 01:46:47,661
Yeah, sure.

1088
01:46:49,369 --> 01:46:51,496
Is that where we got Samson?

1089
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:59,143
Yeah, that's right.
That's exactly where we got him.

1090
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:03,349
Really? You promise? You pinkie promise?

1091
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:11,724
I pinkie promise.

1092
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,198
You see...

1093
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:24,294
that's what makes a promise
such a big deal.

1094
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:29,100
Once you make it, it'll last forever.
