1
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Yes?

2
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
I saw your sign out front. I was
wondering if I could see the guest house.

3
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Well actually, I just got out here.

4
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
But you do work mostly at home?

5
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Uh-huh. I really need
the peace and quiet.

6
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
This is so great.
You see, I'm always in court.

7
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
My husband Cliff spends
more time in airports than at home.

8
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
We'd both feel better
if there was someone around.

9
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
I'll take it.

10
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Great. It's a little
run-down on the inside,

11
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
but there's plenty of spare furniture
in the garage.

12
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Help yourself to anything you'd like.

13
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
That's my daughter, Adrian.

14
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Oh, I think we met...

15
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
out front on the street.

16
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Oh.

17
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
She seemed very, uh...

18
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Headstrong is what I call it,

19
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
but I'm sure you two
will get along fine.

20
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
<i>Just like a toy </i>

21
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
<i>I was waitin' for you</i>

22
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
<i>But you never came</i>

23
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
<i>And I found myself alone...</i>

24
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Hello.

25
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
Get down.

26
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
What's the big deal?

27
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
My parents rented out
the guest house to some guy.

28
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Check him out.

29
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
If you're not back
in five minutes,

30
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
I'll radio for air support.

31
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
<i>I waited for you</i>

32
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
<i>But you never came</i>

33
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
<i>On the way back to my house</i>

34
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
<i>I had to hesitate</i>

35
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Who goes there?

36
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
What?

37
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Identify yourself.
Friend or foe?

38
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Depends.

39
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
<i>Some time today...</i>

40
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
You got a name?

41
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Cheyenne.

42
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Oh, Injun, huh?

43
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Hippie parents.

44
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Oh.

45
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Later.

46
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
<i>Should I speak</i>

47
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
<i>When I saw that man?</i>

48
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,300
<i>I think I saw that face</i>

49
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
<i>I would like to give you more</i>

50
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
<i>I heard that's what
we're all here for</i>

51
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Well?

52
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Well, he's okay.

53
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Kind of cool.

54
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Old.

55
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Hi. I'm Nick Eliot.
I'm here to see Michael.

56
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Nick Eliot?
You're late.

57
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
It's not even 8:30.

58
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Monday meeting starts at 8:15.

59
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
What I'm concerned about
is the focus on this.

60
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Go on.

61
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
You've got to do it.

62
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Oh, okay,
what are you working on right now?

63
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Oh, I'm still
researching the article.

64
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
New here?

65
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
I can tell.

66
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
All right.
Let's get down to business.

67
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Tanya Terrel on the cover.

68
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
If she wants to expose herself,
I'll oblige her.

69
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
I need more pictures,
but keep the text under 1000 words.

70
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
The Senate arms deal is dead.

71
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
The weeklies are beating it to death.

72
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Now, Nicholas Eliot,

73
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Monday's staff meetings
begin at 8:15 precisely.

74
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I expect everyone to be here.

75
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Oh, ahem, my apologies.

76
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
I, uh, just got into town.

77
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Do you really think
I don't know who you are?

78
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
Your former superiors describe you

79
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,300
as an excellent researcher
with fair writing skills.

80
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
You were described as a pitbull
when you're on the scent.

81
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
That's precisely why I hired you.

82
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
What do you know
about Robert Levansky?

83
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
He just got out of jail
and refuses to talk to the press.

84
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
He embezzled almost $2 billion,

85
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
500 million of which
remains unaccounted for.

86
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Dig up everything you can.

87
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Thousands of reporters have
been on that for months.

88
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
It's a black hole.

89
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
I'll expect something by Friday.

90
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Maddik, track Eliot.

91
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
If he finds anything,
I want pictures.

92
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Is he always like this?

93
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Sometimes he's in a bad mood.

94
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Oh.

95
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
<i>And every day</i>

96
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
<i>Must I</i>

97
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
<i>Wait on you hand and foot?</i>

98
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
<i>On the way past, I</i>

99
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
<i>One time when you made me
feel so good...</i>

100
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
So how much are they
paying you to watch me?

101
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>Ribbons in your hair...</i>

102
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Just renting the guest house.

103
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Oh.

104
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
<i>They were never there</i>

105
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
<i>Just like a subscription...</i>

106
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Why are you doing that?

107
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Well, I'm gonna have her painted
now that I can finally afford it.

108
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,300
So, uh...
Fox hunt? Polo?

109
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
No. I'm schooling jumpers.

110
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
I'll be the youngest in my class
to go to Nationals.

111
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Really?
Sounds ambitious.

112
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Yeah, well...

113
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
if only my ride would show,

114
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
maybe I could get to practice.

115
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
<i>This one will never mend</i>

116
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
<i>To show before a friend</i>

117
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Hello. Mario Analdi?

118
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Hi. Nick Eliot.
Pique magazine.

119
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Could you answer
a few questions for us?

120
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
You used to work
for the Levansky family,

121
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
is that right?

122
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
I think we have something.

123
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Yes.

124
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Very attractive.

125
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Oh, this?

126
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Helps me think.

127
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Hmm.

128
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Come in, come in.

129
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
So what are you doing?

130
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Ooh, pretty dry stuff, really.

131
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
You wouldn't be interested.

132
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Try me.

133
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Okay.

134
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
Uh...you ever hear
of Robert Levansky?

135
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
The arbitrage guy
who stole a lot of money.

136
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Allegedly stole.

137
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Uh, anyway,
I found his chauffeur.

138
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
He told me that
he regularly drove Levansky

139
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
up to a house in Knollwood.

140
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Seems Levansky had a...

141
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
friend.

142
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
You mean a lover?

143
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Ahem.

144
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
Well, yeah, yeah.

145
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Yes, um...

146
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
It turns out this woman
flew to Geneva

147
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
six times last year.

148
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Swiss bank accounts loaded
with the missing cash.

149
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
You sure you're only 14?

150
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Almost 15.

151
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
Isn't it way past your bedtime?

152
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Yes.

153
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Uh-huh.

154
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Ahem.

155
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Um...

156
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
So, um... whose pool?

157
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
That's Rockford's.
They're in Maine.

158
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Guess they keep it
lit up for burglars.

159
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Now, who would want
to steal a pool?

160
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Hello?

161
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Hi!

162
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
You know, most people knock.

163
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I did.
You didn't hear.

164
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Is this you?

165
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Mm-hmm. That is me
and David Cummings.

166
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Who?

167
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
He's one of the great reporters
of his generation.

168
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
At one time, he had a byline

169
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
in every paper
across the country.

170
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,100
He was also my grandfather.

171
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
You were so cute.
Can I have it?

172
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
It's the only one I have.

173
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Please?

174
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
No.

175
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
You always write on a computer?

176
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
I'd be lost without it.

177
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Makes you wonder
how your grandfather got along.

178
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Then again, he wasn't writing
for trendy magazines, was he?

179
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Ha ha ha.

180
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Will you get out of here
and let me get dressed?

181
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I got you something.

182
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Oh, yeah?

183
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
What?

184
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Open it and find out.

185
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Wow.

186
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Cool.

187
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Thankyou, Adrian.

188
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Now I'm late.

189
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Um, you're going to come
to my parents' party

190
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
on Saturday night, aren't you?

191
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Uh, I don't know, Adrian.

192
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
My mother invited you.

193
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
I have a lot of work.

194
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
It's going to be
all of Mom's boring friends.

195
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
I'll try.

196
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Not good enough.

197
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
I said I'll try.
Now let me go.

198
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Pretty please?

199
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Out!

200
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Damn.

201
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Hey, is that your article?

202
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Yeah, it just came in.

203
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Great.

204
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Will you two come on?
Michael's waiting.

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

206
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
There's something very wrong here.

207
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Good work, Maddik.

208
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Thank you.

209
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Hid in the rose bushes two hours

210
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
to get that money shot.

211
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
Mm-hmm.

212
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Michael, I'd like to go over that
before you read it.

213
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
One of the copy editors--

214
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
The article's fine.

215
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Get this to the art department.

216
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
We're resetting the whole issue.

217
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
You got the cover, Maddik.

218
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
You owe it to your friend here.

219
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
All right!
Thank you, sir.

220
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Mr. Siegal's office
is holding on line six.

221
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Eliot, not only is
your research excellent,

222
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
but your text is clean, concise.

223
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
You even have some style.

224
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Thank you.

225
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
What the hell.

226
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Hi.

227
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Hi.

228
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Hi.

229
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Oh, Nick,
I'm so glad you could make it.

230
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Honey, this is Nick.

231
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Nick, this is my husband
Cliff Forrester.

232
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
My wife speaks very highly of you.

233
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
How's everything out back?

234
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, well, it's great, sir.

235
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
You have a beautiful place.

236
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Thank you.
You enjoy it.

237
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Thank you.

238
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Honey, look,
there are the Mortins.

239
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I think she's had her eyes done.

240
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Saperstein did her eyes
five years ago.

241
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
No.

242
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
It's her breasts
I was wondering about.

243
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Excuse us, Nick.
Come on.

244
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Hang in there, Nick.

245
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Excuse me.

246
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
That was lovely, Adrian.

247
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Thank you.

248
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Thanks.

249
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
I knew you'd come.

250
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
If you were 10 years older...

251
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
You'd what?

252
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
So how did your boss
like the article?

253
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
It was you?

254
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
You rewrote it?

255
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,100
Hi, Mr. Fogel!

256
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Hello, Adrian!

257
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
How'd you get in?

258
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
It ain't Fort Knox.

259
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Adrian, you can't do that.

260
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
It worked, though, didn't it?

261
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Poor Nick.

262
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
You have such a terrible time
with the objective case,

263
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
and your split infinitives
put such a stress on the adverb.

264
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
You just can't
go around doing that.

265
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
It isn't right.

266
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
I just wanted you to like me.

267
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Of course I like you.

268
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Then take me for a ride.

269
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Now?

270
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Just for a little while.

271
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
There's a place
I want to show you.

272
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I...I don't know.

273
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Please?

274
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Come on, I want to show you.

275
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Adrian.

276
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Beautiful, isn't it?

277
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Yeah, it is.

278
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Look, I'm sorry
about the article,

279
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
and I won't do it again.

280
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Look, I know I'm not
the world's greatest writer,

281
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
but, uh, believe me,

282
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
it's hard to take being bettered

283
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
by a 14 year old kid.

284
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
It's okay really.

285
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
No, it's not.

286
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
You don't know how hard it is
for me to make friends.

287
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
My parents made me skip
two grades in school.

288
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
My only friend is Cheyenne,
and it's only because...

289
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
my mom and her mom
went to college together,

290
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
so she kind of has to.

291
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
It's like everybody thinks
I'm some kind of freak or something,

292
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
like I'm crazy.

293
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Hey, hey.

294
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Come on.

295
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
We can be friends.

296
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
You don't have to.

297
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I know I don't have to.

298
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
It's not a ''have to''
kind of thing.

299
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
That's better.

300
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Please don't be afraid of me.

301
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

302
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
What?

303
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
What?

304
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
We got to go.

305
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Nick.

306
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Come on, come on.

307
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Good night, darling.

308
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Good night.

309
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I love you, Mommy.

310
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
<i>You can taste that</i>

311
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
<i>If you want</i>

312
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
<i>Mmm</i>

313
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
<i>You can taste that</i>

314
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
<i>If you want</i>

315
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
<i>Mmm</i>

316
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
<i>You can taste that if you want</i>

317
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
<i>You can taste that</i>

318
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
<i>If you want</i>

319
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
<i>Mmm</i>

320
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
<i>You can taste that</i>

321
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
<i>If you want</i>

322
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
<i>Mmm</i>

323
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
<i>You can taste that if you want</i>

324
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Nicholas, darling!

325
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Oh, hi, Adrian.

326
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
This is my friend Amy.

327
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Hi.

328
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
My landlord's kid.

329
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Hi.

330
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
See ya.

331
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
''Nicholas''?

332
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
My ''darling''?

333
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Wow.

334
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
<i>Baby, can't you see...</i>

335
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,100
Nick?

336
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Yeah?

337
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
You won't believe who's here.

338
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,100
Who?

339
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Oh, my God.

340
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Michael--ha ha ha--hi.

341
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Jeez, I--I thought you knew
it was a barbecue.

342
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
I wanted to tell you personally.

343
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
I've been on the phone
with the lawyers.

344
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Robert Levansky wants
to speak with you.

345
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
You're kidding.

346
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,100
There's a meeting.

347
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
There'll be an exclusive.
You're part of the deal.

348
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Very good.

349
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
But why?

350
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I don't know.

351
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Frankly, I don't care.

352
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Maybe something in the article
impressed him.

353
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Ah, yes.
Um...here.

354
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
A gift.

355
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Oh...

356
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,100
thank you.

357
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
That's a very fine bottle of wine.

358
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I'd let it breathe
for at least an hour.

359
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
As you were.

360
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
''As you were''?

361
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Well, uh...

362
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
wine and marshmallows, anyone?

363
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Yay! Yeah! Yay!

364
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Here. We need some sticks.

365
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
Okay. I'll scout the orchard.

366
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Ow.

367
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Ahh!

368
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Fuck.

369
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Hi.

370
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
You scared me.

371
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
What are you doing?

372
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
Um...

373
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,300
sticks for marshmallows, you know?

374
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
But those bees.

375
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Wasps.

376
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,100
Yellowjackets...

377
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
genus Vespula.

378
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
They all sting.

379
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Bees won't bother you
unless you bother them.

380
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Wasps are different.

381
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
They're territorial,
and they're social.

382
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Social?

383
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Like they want to be friends?

384
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Like they attack in groups.

385
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
We should leave.

386
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Slowly.

387
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Slowly.

388
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Slowly.

389
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Hey, looks like Nick
made a friend.

390
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
She's pretty.
She's like a model.

391
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
If you like that kind of thing.

392
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Oh, don't worry, Amy.

393
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Some guys really like girls
with small breasts.

394
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
What's with your friend Adrian?

395
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
I thought you guys
were hitting it off.

396
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
Yeah. I know,
but she gives me the creeps.

397
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
She's just a kid.

398
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
She's got a crush on you.

399
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Don't be silly.

400
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Hi. It's me.

401
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Just thinking of you.

402
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
God, that sounds corny.

403
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Call me when you
get a sec, okay?

404
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
Say hi to Amy. Bye.

405
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Nick, I've been there.

406
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
You have to be the adult.

407
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
You can't blur the line.

408
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Are you saying I did something
to provoke this?

409
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Well, did you?

410
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
No. Of course not.

411
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Hello?

412
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
Miss me?

413
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Uh, hello, Adrian.

414
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
What you doing?

415
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
What do you think I'm doing?

416
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
What am I always doing?

417
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm working.

418
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Aw, Nick.
Can't you come out and play?

419
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
No, Adrian.
I'm under deadline.

420
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
Guess what.

421
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
What?

422
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Got my period.

423
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm definitely not pregnant.

424
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
Not that I had
any reason to be.

425
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Adrian...

426
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Yeah?

427
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Did you take my picture,

428
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
the one of me and my grandfather?

429
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,300
No. Why would I do that?

430
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
All right.

431
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
I'll talk to you later.

432
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Adrian!

433
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Hello?

434
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
Anybody home?

435
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Cliff.

436
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Hi.

437
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Nick, well, uh...

438
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
what are you doing here?

439
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Oh, you mean, here?
Well, I was just, uh...

440
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
returning a book to Adrian.
She's upstairs.

441
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh.

442
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,300
So, anyway,
I--I really got to get going.

443
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Could you help me
get this upstairs?

444
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
I don't think my back's
going to make it.

445
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Well, I--

446
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,300
It'll just take a minute.

447
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
Sure appreciate it.

448
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
You are a pal.

449
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Uh, careful there, my man.

450
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
I don't need any lawsuits.

451
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
You know what I mean?

452
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
My little restoration project.

453
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
It's, um...

454
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
really something.

455
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
Yeah.

456
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
I had it shipped out here

457
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
from a carnival in Kansas

458
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
right after Adrian was born.

459
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Dragged every damn piece up here

460
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
one at a time.

461
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Want to see it work?

462
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Sure.

463
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
The motor's kind of old.

464
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
It takes a while
to get up to speed.

465
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Anyway...

466
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
you get the idea.

467
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Plan was to turn
this whole attic

468
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
into a kind of playroom,
you know, for Adrian?

469
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
The only problem was
she never took to it.

470
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Now I can't get
the damn thing down.

471
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
You know, Nick, Adrian's a...

472
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
very special girl.

473
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Mm-hmm.

474
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
She's, um...
She's very bright.

475
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
This past year,
she's really, uh...

476
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
blossomed...

477
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
physically, I mean.

478
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Mmm. I noticed.

479
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
You know, I swear to God,
not a night goes by

480
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
I don't lay awake

481
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
dreading that knock on the door.

482
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
You know what I'm talking about?

483
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
Not really.

484
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
Oh, some friggin' kid
will be standing there

485
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
with his hard-on
sticking out his pants.

486
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Hope I don't go breaking it off.

487
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Heh heh.

488
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Yeah.

489
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Hi, Daddy.

490
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Huh? Oh, hi, sweetheart.

491
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
We were just talking about you.

492
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
I didn't know
who was up here.

493
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
I was showing Nick your carousel.

494
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
It's your carousel, Dad.

495
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Remember, I ride real horses now?

496
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Well, I really ought to get going.

497
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Oh, Adrian,
what book did you loan Nick?

498
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Book?

499
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Oh.

500
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Well, that must have been
Wuthering Heights.

501
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Did you like it?

502
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Yes.

503
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Very much.

504
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Hmm.

505
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
Wuthering Heights, huh?

506
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Sounds femme to me.

507
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Anyway, I--

508
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Ahem.

509
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,300
I really ought to go.

510
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Bye, Nick.

511
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Thanks for returning the book.

512
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Hi.

513
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Can we talk?

514
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Sorry?

515
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
I was wondering
if we could talk.

516
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,300
What do you want
to talk about?

517
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Well, um...

518
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
I don't know.
To tell you the truth,

519
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
it's--it's a little awkward.

520
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Uh...

521
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Would you mind stopping that?

522
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Why?

523
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Never mind.

524
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,300
I hardly know where to begin.

525
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
I--I guess
what I want to say is...

526
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
I really like you, Adrian.

527
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,300
I really like you, too.

528
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,300
No, I--I mean, as a friend.

529
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
I mean, let's face it.

530
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
You're 14.
I'm 28.

531
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,300
That's a big difference.

532
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Whatever you say.

533
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
No. No. Seriously, Adrian.

534
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Now, I want you to know
you can count on me.

535
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
I'll always be your friend,

536
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
no matter what, okay?

537
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Okay.

538
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Like that night up
at the lighthouse

539
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,300
when we kissed?

540
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
Now, that was a mistake, Adrian.

541
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Was sneaking in to watch me
undress a mistake?

542
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Hmm?

543
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
Nick...

544
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
ever do a virgin?

545
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,300
What?

546
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
I know you want to.

547
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Now, look.
Let's avoid any confusion here.

548
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
I'll make this very simple for you.

549
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,300
You're too young for me.

550
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
There's nothing between us.
Nothing.

551
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
Hmm.

552
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Wait till you see this.

553
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
I can't believe
you bought me a car.

554
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I didn't.

555
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
I won't feel
any different about you.

556
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,300
I didn't buy you a car.

557
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Then what's the surprise?

558
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Wait right here.

559
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Okay. Grab an end.

560
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
You ready?

561
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
Never been so ready.

562
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
Huh?

563
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Check it out.
Factory paint.

564
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,300
I got matching vinyl interior.

565
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
This is one of
the finest pieces of iron

566
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,300
ever came out of Detroit.

567
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Sugar?

568
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Well, um...

569
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
if you didn't, uh,
actually see her--

570
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
is that right?

571
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,300
No, I didn't actually see her.

572
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
So you're not absolutely certain.

573
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Well, no, I'm...

574
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
not absolutely.

575
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
But--But I do feel--

576
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
But I--I just...

577
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
I just feel very strongly
that she did this.

578
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,100
Mm-hmm.

579
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Hi. I'm going out with Cheyenne.

580
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Hi, Nick.

581
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,300
Adrian...

582
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,300
I have a question.

583
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Hmm?

584
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Did you scratch up Nick's car?

585
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Why would I do that?

586
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
Got to go.

587
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,300
Bye.

588
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Well, uh, that's that, then.

589
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Can I have some of that newspaper?

590
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Not the crossword.

591
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Hey, Cheyenne.

592
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,300
I--I need to talk to you...

593
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
about Adrian.

594
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,300
What?

595
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
Not now.
Meet me in back of the orchard

596
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,300
at 7:00 when the streetlights come on.

597
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
Cheyenne, wait.

598
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Wait.

599
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,300
Hi, Cheyenne.

600
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
Why are you so slow?

601
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Everybody asks me that.

602
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Cheyenne, come on!
We're waiting!

603
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Shit.

604
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Don't worry.
Go get dressed.

605
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
I'll take care of Buttercup.

606
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,100
Thanks.

607
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
Sure.

608
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Keep a feel of her
through the triple.

609
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,300
That's good.

610
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,300
Just relax.

611
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,300
Thanks for helping me
tack her up.

612
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,300
Sure.

613
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
Good.

614
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Adrian, let's go!

615
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
Bye. Good luck.

616
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,300
Good luck.

617
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
Cheyenne, you're up!

618
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,300
Keep her steady.
Don't let her roll.

619
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,100
Go call Mr. Gassinger.

620
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Willie, get after that horse.

621
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,300
Cheyenne, stay still.

622
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,300
Cheyenne, are you okay?

623
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Oh!

624
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,300
Oh!

625
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Hang on. Hold on.

626
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,300
Cheyenne?

627
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,300
Adrian!

628
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
You scared the hell out of me.

629
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,300
Just out for a stroll?

630
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
I thought you were Cheyenne.

631
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
So now you like Cheyenne?

632
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,300
Don't be ridiculous.

633
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Maybe you'd like to visit her
in the hospital.

634
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Hospital?
What are you talking about?

635
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,300
Cheyenne took a little spill
at riding today.

636
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,300
I-Is she all right?

637
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
She'll be okay.

638
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,300
It just goes to show you, Nick,

639
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
you can never be too careful.

640
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
Go ahead.
I'll be right there.

641
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,300
Hi, Amy.

642
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Hello, Adrian.

643
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
You know, I was wondering.

644
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Have you ever been
out to the lighthouse?

645
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
You mean Shelter Point?

646
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
Yeah. Make-out place.

647
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Not since high school.

648
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
It's nice.

649
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,300
You should definitely go.

650
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,300
Nick took me.

651
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,300
Maybe he'll take you sometime.

652
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,300
Hi.

653
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,300
Let me remind you
about the benefit next Sunday--

654
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,300
mandatory attendance.

655
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Nicholas, what do you got for us?

656
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,300
The printout should be here soon.

657
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,300
What was Levansky like?

658
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,300
Is it true about his hair?

659
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,300
Ha ha ha!

660
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,300
It was kind of interesting.

661
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,300
I was sitting in
what must have been his den.

662
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
There were pictures everywhere--

663
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
him with the governor,
the White House--

664
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,300
Uh, excuse me one minute.

665
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,300
What is it?

666
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,300
It's blank.

667
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,300
What?

668
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,300
I don't know what to tell you.

669
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,300
There's nothing on it.

670
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,300
Something wrong, Eliot?

671
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,300
No, no. Um...

672
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,300
must have brought the wrong file.

673
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,300
It's okay.
I have plenty of copies at home.

674
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,300
I'll be right back.

675
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Yeah?

676
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,300
It's gone, Amy.

677
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,300
The whole thing--
the interview, the disks,

678
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,300
my cassettes, my notes, everything.

679
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,300
She came in here
and completely fucked me!

680
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
Whoa. What are you talking about?

681
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,300
Adrian. Who do you think?

682
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,300
The biggest story of my career,

683
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,300
and she-- she wipes me out.

684
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,300
What can I do?

685
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,300
I need you to cover for me
with Michael.

686
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,300
Can you do that?

687
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,300
Hello?

688
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,300
I'll try.

689
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,300
Great. Thanks...

690
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,300
And, Amy?

691
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
As soon as I finish
rewriting this thing,

692
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,300
I'm out of here for good.

693
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
Smart move, Eliot.

694
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,300
All right. Bye.

695
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,300
Yeah.

696
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,300
I think we should talk.

697
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,300
Fuck.

698
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,300
Hi. l'm not in.

699
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,300
You know the procedure.

700
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
Nick, this is pretty pathetic.

701
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
You're there.
Just answer.

702
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Answer the fucking phone.

703
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
Uhh!

704
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
Uhh!

705
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,300
You sure you want the Kryptonite?

706
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,300
It's 40 bucks extra.

707
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Give me the Kryptonite.

708
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
But does it make me want
to read the magazine?

709
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,300
I can't understand it.

710
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,300
It's all in...

711
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,300
I found it.

712
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,100
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

713
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,300
If you're going to use
this lettering,

714
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,300
use it right.

715
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,300
Make it simple, meaningful.

716
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,300
People are very simple minded.

717
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,300
Treat them such.

718
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,300
Do it again.

719
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,300
I'll get a plumber to fix the shower

720
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
and have my grandson

721
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
give you fresh paint.

722
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,300
First of the month sound okay?

723
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,300
I was hoping to move in this week,

724
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,300
if it's all right.

725
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,300
Why don't we let your check clear

726
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,300
and get that shower fixed?

727
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,300
I'll let you know
first thing next week.

728
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,300
Great. Thank you,
Mrs. Tinkerman, really.

729
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,300
Hi.

730
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,300
Hey.

731
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Brought you a present, Nick.

732
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,300
Cool.

733
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,300
I don't think we need to
let it breathe, do you?

734
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,300
No, I don't think so.

735
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,300
Looks like you took care of everything.

736
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,300
Pretty much.

737
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,300
If it's worth anything,
I'm glad you're moving.

738
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
You're glad.
I'm overjoyed.

739
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
Hey, Nick.

740
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,100
Yeah?

741
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,300
I got to ask you a question.

742
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,300
Shoot.

743
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,300
Next week, Michael's benefit--

744
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,300
Are you going?

745
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,300
Well, we, uh... have to, right?

746
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,300
I want you to go with me.

747
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
What, you mean,
like together, on a date?

748
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,300
Okay. Never mind.
I know I shouldn't have--

749
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,300
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

750
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
Whatever happened to, um...

751
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,300
''don't get your meat
where you lay your eggs'' thing?

752
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,300
Bread. Where you make your bread.

753
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Bread, right.

754
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,300
Well...

755
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,300
I wouldn't want to...

756
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,300
see you slow dance with Samantha.

757
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,300
Mm-hmm.

758
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,300
Or some 13 year old.

759
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,300
14.

760
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,300
Uh...wouldn't like that.

761
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Adrian!

762
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,300
What are you doing?

763
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,300
Making lemonade.

764
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,300
Want some?

765
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,300
Hello, Adrian.

766
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
How are you today?

767
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,100
Fine.

768
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,300
That's good.

769
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,300
Hey, Amy.

770
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,300
What?

771
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,300
What did you do last night?

772
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
What do you mean?

773
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
I mean, you slept at Nick's,
didn't you?

774
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,300
Adrian...

775
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,300
Well, I mean, you didn't...

776
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
you know.

777
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,300
Adrian...

778
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,300
let me explain
a little something to you.

779
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,300
One day,
when you're all grown up

780
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,300
and you have a real relationship,

781
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
you'll realize your feelings
for Nick were just a crush.

782
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,300
In fact,
I bet by the time school starts,

783
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,300
you'll have completely forgotten
all about him.

784
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,300
God, Amy...
when I grow up,

785
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,300
I hope I can be
just as smart as you.

786
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,300
Adrian...

787
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,300
go play.

788
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,300
Oh, my God.

789
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,300
Aah!

790
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,300
Oh! Oh!

791
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,300
Oh, God!

792
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,300
No! No! No!

793
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,300
Hello.

794
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,300
Oh, hi, Michael.

795
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,300
No, no. I was just
going over a few things.

796
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,300
Really?

797
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,300
Can I come in?

798
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,300
No. It's fine.
What is it?

799
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,300
Sorry.

800
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,300
There's been an accident.

801
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,300
Just want to give you
the info on the competition.

802
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,300
Wh-What happened?

803
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,300
What?

804
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,300
Oh, Jesus!

805
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,300
Um...yeah.
Wh-Where is it?

806
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,300
Okay. I'll be right over.
All right. Bye.

807
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,300
What's wrong?

808
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Uh...it's Amy.

809
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,300
She's at the hospital.

810
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,300
She's been in
some kind of accident.

811
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
Oh, Nick!

812
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
I'm so sorry.

813
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,300
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

814
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,300
l'd like to welcome you to the Regional
Junior Jumping Championships.

815
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,300
He literally cried on my shoulder.
Poor baby.

816
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,300
Broke my heart.

817
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,300
So how is she?

818
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,300
Oh...well,
they think she'll live, but...

819
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,300
I think it's brought
Nick and I a lot closer.

820
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,300
Well, you'll sit with him,
won't you?

821
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,300
If I see him...
If he comes.

822
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
He'll be here.

823
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
Aren't you going to tell me
to break a leg?

824
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,300
Break them both.

825
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,300
First off is number 87.

826
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,300
Miss Linda Mattheson riding Snowdrop.

827
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,300
Number 191.

828
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
Miss Kelly Sensabough riding Ace High.

829
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,300
Number  62...

830
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,300
Give them to me.

831
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,300
Number 183.

832
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,300
Miss Adrian Forrester riding Sinbad.

833
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,300
I think it's important
in our busy lives

834
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,300
that we remember those less fortunate.

835
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,300
I'd like to thank you all
for your generosity

836
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,300
and hope you will continue
to support our cause.

837
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,300
I'd like to introduce you

838
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,300
to the American president of NANDEC,

839
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,300
Miss Abigail Spaulding.

840
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,300
Hi, sweetheart.

841
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,300
What are you doing here?

842
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,300
Missed you at the show.
Something come up?

843
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,300
Get out of here.

844
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,300
Too busy kissing ass to care about me,
is that it?

845
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,300
Ow!

846
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,300
Forgive us.
I'll have him back in a jiffy.

847
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,300
Ow!

848
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,300
Stay the fuck away from me!

849
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,300
- I thought we were--
- We're nothing!

850
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,300
I love you, Nick.
You love me.

851
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,300
You're sick.

852
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,300
You fucking--

853
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,300
Aah! Aah!

854
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,300
Aah!

855
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,300
You're pathetic.

856
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
Mrs. Tinkerman!

857
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,300
Mrs. Tinkerman,
it's me, Nick Eliot.

858
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,300
The apartment's taken.

859
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,300
What? What are you talking about?

860
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
I don't rent to drug dealers!

861
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,300
Oh, God!

862
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,300
The girl you rent from told me!

863
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
Mrs. Tinkerman, she's lying!

864
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,100
Mrs. Tinkerman!

865
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,300
I'll give you three
to get out of here.

866
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,300
1 ...

867
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,300
Nicholas Eliot?

868
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,300
Yeah?

869
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,300
Hands up and step slowly
from the car.

870
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,300
What's happening?

871
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,300
Out now.

872
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,300
You mind telling me
what this is about?

873
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,300
I'm going to tell you.
You're under arrest.

874
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,300
What?

875
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,300
For sexual assault of a minor.

876
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,300
What? What are you talking about?

877
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,300
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

878
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,300
Damn it!

879
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,300
Honey, honey, I know.

880
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,300
Cliff!

881
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,300
You fucking animal!

882
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,300
Get him off of me!

883
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,300
Get him off me!

884
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,300
Cliff!

885
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,300
Get him off me!

886
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,300
Stay back!

887
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,300
Watch your head.

888
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,300
We went swimming...

889
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,300
and hung out a couple of times,

890
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,300
but it was nothing.

891
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,300
And, um...

892
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,300
he just wouldn't take no
for an answer.

893
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,300
And he...

894
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,300
he threw me down, and, um...

895
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,300
hit me.

896
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,300
And he--he just kept hitting me,

897
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,300
and I was crying.

898
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,300
He kept hitting me

899
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,300
and yelling.

900
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,300
I was so scared.

901
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,300
You'll be okay.

902
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,300
Ought to put Dad
in a room with him,

903
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,300
call it a day.

904
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,300
From the day I moved in,
she's been hassling me.

905
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,300
She calls me up
in the middle of the night,

906
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,300
hanging around.
She--She breaks into the place.

907
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,300
She scratches up my car.

908
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,300
The girl is spun.

909
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,300
Why won't anyone fucking believe me?

910
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,300
You ever have sexual contact
of any kind with her?

911
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,300
You think I'm crazy? No!

912
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,300
You ever place your penis
inside her vagina?

913
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,300
I just told you, no!

914
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,300
She's crazy!
You ought to lock her up!

915
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,300
You rape a little girl,
you act like she's crazy?

916
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,300
I didn't do anything!

917
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,300
Jesus Christ!

918
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,300
Did you check out
that-- that room in the garage,

919
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,300
the one with the shrine?

920
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,300
We got a problem, Nick.

921
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,300
Big problem.

922
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,300
What?

923
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,300
We found semen inside of her.

924
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,300
Let's go.

925
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,300
The parents are taking
the girl away tonight,

926
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,300
down the coast somewhere.

927
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,300
Until that time,
you're not permitted

928
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,300
within 100 feet of the house.

929
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,300
After they've gone, you can gather
your possessions and move.

930
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,300
It doesn't matter where, just away.

931
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,300
The semen sample matches
your blood type.

932
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,300
Look...I figured it out.

933
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,300
She got hold of a condom.

934
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,300
She must have snuck in

935
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,300
and, uh, stolen one from the trash.

936
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,300
Michael...

937
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,300
I swear I never laid
a hand on her.

938
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,300
You got to believe me. She...

939
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,300
She's crazy.

940
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,300
She's also a little girl...

941
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,300
a 14 year old girl.

942
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,300
Now you be the jury.

943
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Ow! Goddamn it!

944
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,300
Jesus!

945
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,300
Cheyenne, what are you doing here?

946
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
I had to talk to you.

947
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,300
You shouldn't be here.

948
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,300
I've got enough trouble.

949
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,300
You didn't do
those things to Adrian.

950
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,300
Y-You d-didn't do those things.

951
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,300
Of course not.

952
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,300
I knew she was making it up.
I knew it.

953
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,300
What is it, Cheyenne?

954
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,300
Did Adrian ever tell you
about a guy named Rick?

955
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,300
Yeah, I think so.

956
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,300
Said he was a friend.
Why?

957
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,300
He was our camp counselor.

958
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Adrian had a crush on him.

959
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,300
So?

960
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,300
He's dead.
He ate something poisoned.

961
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,300
Everyone thought
it was an accident...

962
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,300
b-but Adrian knows stuff,

963
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,300
stuff other kids don't.

964
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,300
She knows about wasps, too.

965
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,300
I know.

966
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,300
I thought about that.

967
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,300
But there's just no proof.

968
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,300
But I think there might be.

969
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,300
Adrian kept a diary.

970
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,300
She writes everything in it.

971
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,300
She thinks no one knows,
but I've seen it.

972
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,300
She kept it hidden in her bedroom.

973
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,300
I'll tell the lawyers about it, but...

974
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,300
you got to forget all about Adrian.

975
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,300
She's sick.
You understand?

976
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
Come on.
You really shouldn't be here.

977
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,300
She's a liar.
She's lying about you.

978
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,300
I know.
I can take care of myself.

979
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,300
Come on.
I'll walk you.

980
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,300
I'll be all right.

981
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
Done it a million times.

982
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,300
Later.

983
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
Later.

984
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,300
Cheyenne!

985
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,300
Cheyenne!

986
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,300
So this is what it takes
to finally get you up here.

987
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,300
What are you doing?

988
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,300
Fixing things.

989
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,300
Where's Cheyenne?

990
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,300
You want to do her, too?

991
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,300
I'm not good enough?

992
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,300
Where is she, Adrian?

993
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,300
I came back here for you.

994
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,300
My parents tried
to take me away,

995
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,300
but I fooled them.

996
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,300
Where is she?

997
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,300
I came back and found you
with my best friend.

998
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,300
I still love you, Nick!

999
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,300
Cheyenne!

1000
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,100
Nick!

1001
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,300
Cheyenne!

1002
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,300
Nick!

1003
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,300
Aah! Aah!

1004
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,300
Accidents happen, Nick.

1005
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,300
I warned you.

1006
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,300
You know...

1007
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,300
in 10 years none of this
would have mattered.

1008
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,300
I'd be 24.

1009
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,300
You'd be 38.

1010
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,300
It's so sad it had to end this way.

1011
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,300
What we had was so special...

1012
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,300
but...

1013
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,300
here we are.

1014
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
Too bad you didn't listen.

1015
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,300
Just want you to know, Nick...

1016
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,300
no matter what happens...

1017
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,300
we'll always be friends.

1018
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,300
Adrian!

1019
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,300
Adrian!

1020
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,300
Adrian! Shit!

1021
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,300
Oh!

1022
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,300
Adrian!

1023
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Adrian! God--

1024
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,300
Cheyenne!

1025
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,300
Cheyenne!

1026
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,300
Goddamn it!

1027
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,300
Adrian!

1028
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,300
Cheyenne.

1029
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,300
Ha!

1030
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,300
Jesus!

1031
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,300
You okay?

1032
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,300
Hold on.

1033
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,300
Aah!

1034
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,300
I'm going to kill you!

1035
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,300
Adrian!

1036
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,300
Dad! Dad!

1037
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,300
Daddy, help me!

1038
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,300
I'll kill you!

1039
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,300
You son of a bitch!

1040
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,300
Leave him alone!

1041
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,300
Aah!

1042
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,300
So there you are.

1043
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,300
It's quiet in here.

1044
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,300
Mmm.

1045
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,300
Another letter?

1046
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,300
Yeah.

1047
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,300
If only he'd let me apologize,

1048
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,300
I'd feel so much better.

1049
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,300
Hey, you've been making
great progress.

1050
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,300
Concentrate on that.

1051
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,300
I just wish everyone was
as understanding as you are.

1052
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,300
Well, they will be.

1053
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,300
It'll just take time

1054
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,300
for people to see
that you've changed, okay?

1055
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,300
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,300
You better get to class.

1057
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,300
I'll see you in our session
this afternoon.

1058
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,100
Okay.

1059
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,300
Bye-bye.

1060
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,300
Bye.

1061
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,300
Ha ha. Sleepyhead missed
the morning meeting.

1062
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,300
Shit!

1063
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,300
Oh, man!

1064
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,300
Don't worry.

1065
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,300
I told Michael

1066
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,300
you're on the trail
of some big story.

1067
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,300
Thanks.

1068
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,300
Air mail.
