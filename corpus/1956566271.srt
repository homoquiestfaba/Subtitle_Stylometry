00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,286
This is called a carjacking.

331
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,495
This is called a carjacking.

332
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,166
- [Marshall] Guys.
- [Rush] This is...

333
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,650
- Let's talk outside.
- [Rush] Yeah.

334
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,666
[stammering] So, what I'm supposed...

335
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,958

- [soft] Let's talk outside.

That was fun, right?

I am Rush Williams!
You don't do that to Rush Williams!

Look at me! Look at me.

342
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,541
Number one!

343
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,500
And here, look! What does that say?

344
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,250
[gasps] Number one! And guess what?

345
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,500
- Highest rated! Fan favorite!

You don't do this to the star man!

And you are huge! In R&B, though.

348
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,375
Stacy K is number one in Pop.

349
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,250
In New York, and Los Angeles,
and soon to be the entire nation!

350
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,666
This is out of nowhere, Marshall.
Is that it? We're off the air?

351
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,000
The devil is a lie!

352
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,291
Why would you think that I would possess
that kind of energy to do that to you?

353
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,351
- Come on! No, you have not.
- You know what?

354
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,017
- Oh. Thank God.
- I got a little emotional.

355
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,875
You did.

356
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,875
I'm going to give you
a grand finale show tomorrow.

You really gonna look us in our eye
and say that? You gonna fix your mouth

363
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,750
to say that after we met today?
You know why we met, Marshall!

364
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,916
You see this right here?

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
This is a plan. Know what's in it?

366
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,541
- [Marshall] What...
- Graphs! Pie charts!

367
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,833
A proposal to own part of this station,
Marshall!

368
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,458
And I understand that,
[stammers] but you...

369
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,125

This... These... Are these the numbers?

Oh, my God.

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,309
I'm so mad y'all didn't become
part owners before the deal went through.

372
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,750
- I mean, look at this. These numbers...
- Okay, okay.

373
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,875
At least we got our bonuses
to look forward to.

374
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,416
[stammers] Got your what?

375

[stammers] Our bonuses.

376
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,208

00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,833
[Roxy] Exactly.

381
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,458
This is ridiculous.

382
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,430
[Rush] H-how did she even get
the position?

383
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,958
[Roxy] I should've seen this coming.

384

No, no, this changes too much.

388
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,458
This changes too much.

389
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,416
When I walk into that booth,

390
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,666
and I settle into my chair,
and I lean in...

391
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,750
I smell the metal of that microphone...

392
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,333
and it gets me going.

393
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:20,833
The second that mic is hot, we are live,
and that is my moment

394
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,875
to connect with my people.

395
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,958
And you might think that I'm freestyling,
but no, my message is clear,

396
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,250
and it is from my heart.

397
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,250
Every... single show, I try to nail that.

398
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,708
Every single day,
for all these years and to just...

399
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,583
To just have it
yanked away from you like...

400
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,583
It just feels like I'm losing a body part.
- [wind, vehicles whirring]

00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,041

What am I going to tell the kids, though?
Okay, Christmas is around the corner!

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,666
Man, those little faces.
They just want so much.

407
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,875
I mean expect so much.
Not so much expect, as demand.

408
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,017
They threaten me, even. [stammers]
I tell you, the twins pulled a knife.

00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,708
[sniffles]

495
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,458
Are you done? For whatever that was?

496
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,875
The radio station sold.

497
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,958
Job gone.

498
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,333
No more radio. It's done.

499
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,583
- You've saved. I know you've saved.
- How, Aunt Jo?

500
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:10,500
The bills, they get higher every month.
We got fresh bills!

501
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,875
Jamal had to go to Costa Rica
to volunteer to dig wells,

502
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,583
so that they could have "clean water."

503
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,750
Mya's platinum status on Saks.com,
and the twins, there's two of them!

504
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,125
And they all go to private school.
Not to mention, it's Christmas.

505
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,791
Rashon James Williams!

506
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,708
You spoil those kids.

507
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,125
They snap their fingers,
and you open your wallet.

508
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,333
I've been trying to be both parents.

509
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,833
Give them everything they wanted
because I can't be everything,

510
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,208
and yeah, okay, [stammering]
maybe I gave a little too much.

511
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,291
You think?

512
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,541
That life's about to change.

513
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,791
- Straight up.
- Oh, yeah.

514
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,875
We're about to make
some changes around here.

515
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,083
- Snap the whip.
- [chuckles]

516
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,000
Things about to get tight.
They about to get lean.

517
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,750
These kids gonna be giving up a whole lot.
How do I tell them that?

518
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,291
I don't wanna tell them that.
Aunt Jo, please.

519
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,000
You tell them and bake 'em a pie, okay?
I'mma go lay down.

520
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,666
This is not a pie situation, son.

521
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,375
Remember what your granddaddy said.

522
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,958
It's not what you got,
it's what you got around you.

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,333
[whispering] What about Christmas
for the kids?

524
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,958
It's going to be all right.

525
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,458
Have a little faith.

526
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,916
Everybody keeps telling me that.

527
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,041
["Christmas Eve Can Kill You" playing]

528
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,458
[Rush] <i>That was the Everly Brothers,</i>

529
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,666
"Christmas Eve Can Kill You."

530
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,791
Stay tuned for a word from our sponsors.

531
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:39,875
Merry Christmas.

532
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,541
Rush out.

533
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,750
Forever.

534
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,708
- [smooth jazz Christmas music playing]
- [Janella] Should I call 911?

535
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,291
Rush's mental state doesn't seem stable.

536
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,708
That's not the note we should have
gone out on for your last show.

537
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,041
You want fans to follow you
wherever you go.

538
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,000
Not follow you off a cliff.

539
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,166
You got to rise above this nonsense.

540
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,666
[smooth jazz Christmas music continues]

541
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,250
Be Rush.

542
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:22,958
Be my star.

543
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,041
[Rush scoffs]

544
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,333
Well, if I'm going down in flames...

545
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,583
I'm glad you're the one burning with me.

546
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,666
[laughing]

547
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,583

- [inhales]

[Rush sighs]

00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,291
[Roxy sighs]

550
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,000
- We're poor?
- [funky music playing]

551
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,541
- Did I say we were poor?
- But you don't have a job.

552
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,541
And you pretty much broadcasted that
to everyone.

553
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,875
Brilliant!

554
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,833
- So, no horse?
- It's mini-sized.

555
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,458
None of that is happening, okay?

556
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,875
In fact, there's a whole lot
of not happening

557
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,875
- that's about to start happening.
- [groans]

558
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,791
- Wait, is Harvard not happening?
- I want it to.

559
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,875
- So, what's the plan?
- I don't know yet, son.

560
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,833
- Great.
- Great.

561
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,250
Hey, give me some time.

562
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,750
[scoffs]

563
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,083
- Unbelievable.
- So bad.

564
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,101
- [retreating footsteps]
- [Gabby] This is worse than bad!

565
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,291
[indistinct remarks]

566
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,135
[Rush] Y'all sitting all off
in the bleachers

567
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,934
- like y'all can't hear the conversation?
- [Roxy sighs]

568
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,958
["O Come O Come Emmanuel" instrumentals]

569
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,291
[rustling]

570
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,375
Looks like you have plans
for a holly jolly Christmas.

571
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,375
[approaching footsteps]

572
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,666
[sighs] Rush, we need to talk.

573
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,541
- Did it come through yet?
- It's getting close. [exhales]

574
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,185
- [Aunt Jo] Did you tell him yet?
- I don't have all the details.

575
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,166
You know, I kinda like and dislike
the fact that y'all are so close.

576
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,041
- Mostly dislike.
- [Roxy] Okay.

577
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,958
Rush, what if I told you that Krush BQL
is for sale?

578
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,875
Well, great,
more people losing their jobs.

579
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,083
No, it closed down a couple months ago.

580
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,833
The building is for sale.
The station is up for grabs.

581
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,625
So, WBQL is for sale. What's for dinner?

582
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:21,500
I figured you'd make it
after you finish all your decoration.

583
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,250
Hey! Listen to me.
We should buy that station.

584
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:27,000
With what, Roxy? My megawatt smile?

585
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,083
With money!

586
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,625
I built up a pretty hefty 401k.

587
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,291
You'd put that up for me?

588
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:34,916
For us.

589
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:39,166
I'm touched, Roxy, for real.

590
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,583
But it'd take
a much bigger Christmas miracle than that.

591
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,333
[Aunt Jo] Is this big enough?

592
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,541
Aw.

593
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,892
That's sweet, Aunt Jo. But I don't think
your little coffee can stash

594
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:51,916
is going to help much.

595
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
[chuckles] There's $45,000 in there.

596
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,758
You wouldn't happen to have more
of these stashed under the house, huh?

597
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,333
Oh, no, honey, that's my mad money.

598
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,916
My investment manager
takes care of all the big stuff.

599
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,291
Wait, does everyone else have money
stashed away but me?

600
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,833
'Cause my money just seems
to fly away before I can grab it.

601
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,125
- Rush.
- Yes?

602
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,875
You got your first break
at that station, right?

603
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,767
- [sighs]
- Let's get back to where we started.

604
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,291
Isn't that what we always dreamed of?

605
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,666
That station is way down the dial, Roxy.

606
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,125
Yeah, but I miss the time
when we ruled the airwaves.

607
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,166
We just got kicked off the airwaves
last week.

608
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,541
We could be a part
of the community again, right?

609
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,625
Remember block parties,
and pop-up concerts?

610
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,166
Charity drives?

611
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,208
We could sponsor Christmas dinner
at First Community Church.

612
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,125
- Yeah.
- Come on, we used to live for that.

613
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,083
And the WMLE suits
shut all of that down,

614
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,500
and we can bring it all back.

615
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,791
- [serene instrumentals]
- Can't you see it?

616
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,500
We get to play the music we want.

617
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,208
We get to play the music we want.

618
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,625
It's like the universe
is screaming at us right now.

619
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,625
Let's build Krush BQL back up.

620
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,916
- We'd be taking a huge risk huge.
- Huge, yeah.

621
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:05,791
Risk? Eh...
Why don't you let me handle that?

622
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,750
Yeah? Is that a yes?

623
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah?

624
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,666
- Start counting.
- Yes!

625
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,250
[Rush and Roxy laughing]

626
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,333
Oh, it's about to be real merry
up in here.

627
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,000
- Wow. Okay. All right.
- Whoo!

628
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,875
- [melodic] Rush and Roxy!
- [Rush] Hey!

629
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,291
- That's it.
- [Rush] Oh!

630
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,833
[Roxy laughs]

631
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,708
- [glass clinks]
- [Rush vocalizes to the beat]

632
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,250
- [indistinct chatter]
- All right. Old school. Never mind.

633
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,583
Listen, hey,
I'm seeing a bright star on our horizon.

634
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,306
- [playful Christmas instrumentals]
- An opportunity for all of us.

635
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,166
My old station,

636
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:48,083
the one that got the Rush engine
on the track to begin with, is for sale.

637
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,875
And Roxy and I are buying it.

638
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,916
Sounds like somebody's spending money
we don't have.

639
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,375
Will you hear me out?

640
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,416
I'm going to need all of you.

641
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,791
Even Aunt Jo kicked in a little cash.

642
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,458
- And I know that it's Christmas...
- [Mya] Oh.

643
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,666
I figured Christmas
was already off the table.

644
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,166
Not necessarily,
but there will be some sacrifices.

645
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:10,791
Now, in order for me to come up
with my share of the money

646
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,041
to buy the station,

647
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,541
- I'm going to need to... [muffled speech]
- What?

648
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,225
- [Mya] What was that?
- I'm sorry, what?

649
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,625
I said, I'm going to need to put
the house... [garbling]

650
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,791
- [Gabby] Hmm?
- You have to speak louder.

651
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm going to need to sell our house.

652
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,625
- Wait, our house?
- Oh, snap!

653
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,250
I didn't see homeless on the menu.

654
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,875
I am always going to provide for you kids,
okay? [stammering] But let's face it.

655
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:37,166
We've gotten a little... What's the word?

656
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,541
Bougie.

657
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,305
Will you finish eating your pizza, please?

658
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,458
Now, stay with me.

659
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:44,708
Just stay with me, here.
I want you to think big picture, right?

660
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,958
This is a better future for all of us.

00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,333
And if you didn't hear your former DJ
bought another radio station, well, then,

832
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,166
you're a beat behind.

833
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:56,958
This will not affect our Christmas launch.

834
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,583
I mean, all due respect,
but I'm not sure if there's anything

835
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,583
- that we really can do...
- Stations need advertising.

836
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,466
I mean,
we just can't stop advertisers from...

837
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:11,166
We can, and you will, Marshall.
We hold the cards in this market.

838
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,833
You need to flex some money muscle.

839
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,416
Advertisers must not buy any time
on that station.

840
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,625
[Marshall scoffs]

841
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,250
Oh, that's hardcore.

842
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:24,250
Listen, the only thing I care about
is winning the market.

843
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:28,708
My priority is this station
beating any and all competition.

844
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,916
Somebody has to win...

845
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,458
- [hand whacks desk]
- and that better be me.

846
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,583
- Yeah.
- We're done.

847
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,791
Come on, Tinker Bell.

848
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:43,458
I don't like that dude's suits.

849
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,083
You can't do this.

850
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,375
You heard the lady.
I mean, I have no choice!

851
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,041
It's Rush and Roxy.

852
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:54,083
- It's just business, that's what...
- You gonna Grinch their Christmas?

853
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,250
- Nah, it's just business.
- [Janella] Wow.

854
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,791
This is a new low.

855
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,625
[Marshall] But it's business.

856
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,708
Marshall...

857
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,958
[laughs] You don't understand business.

858
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,041
[train rumbling]

859
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,767
["Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy" playing
in the background]

860
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:11,916
[utensils clank]

861
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,708
This house ain't so bad.

862
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,791
You have food like this on the table.

863
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:17,875
[clank]

864
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,625
Yeah, I guess it beats outside.

865
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,458
[Aunt Jo chuckles]

866
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,083
[silverware scraping]

867
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,500
Okay, we're done.

868
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,583
Yeah.

869
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,375
Don't take one more step.

870
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:38,875
Santa's elves are not coming up in here,
cleaning up this mess.

871
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,333
Gabby, Evie, your plates need to find
a new home in the kitchen.

872
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,375
Jamal, clear off this table.

873
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,750
Mya, you're scrubbing skillets.

874
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:52,833
[soft huff]

875
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,208
You're in my house now.

876
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,875
I'm scared of you.

877
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,500
[Aunt Jo] Good!

878
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,666
'Cause I got eyes everywhere, my children.

879
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:05,541
Back of my head, one on each elbow.
You never know.

880

887
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,666
[Rush] Are you...?

888
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,934
[Rush voice-over]
<i>...better keep dancing in their heads.</i>

889
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,583
[Rush] You know what?
You get to have that one. I ain't...

890
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,583
[peck]

891
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,750
- [indistinct shouting in the background]
- [sighs]

892
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,625
- [tires screeching]
- [car honking frantically]

893
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,166
- [indistinct shouting]
- [dog barking]

894
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,833
Saint Nick, if you don't show up...

895
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,296
you ain't got to worry about that clatter,
'cause I'm bringing it to you.

896
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,875
I'm not the one. I'm really not the one.

897
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,166
- You can try me if you want.[chuckles]
- [dog continues to bark]

898
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,375
But I'm not that dude.

899
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,500
[couch rattling]

900
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,250
[Rush] Rush gon' give it to you.

901
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,958
[Rush] Back where we started... WBQL.
[soft chuckle]

902
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,958
Hasn't changed one bit.

903
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,791
[lightly chuckles]
You say it like it's a good thing.

904
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,541
Okay, okay.

905
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,083
[Roxy sighs]

906
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,666
[Roxy] I spoke to Pastor Abernathy
at First Community.

907
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,166
We are on for sponsoring
the Christmas meal.

908
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,416
That feels good.

909
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Mm-hmm.

910
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,309
- [chair squeaking]
- And how does that feel?

911
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,416
- Squeaky.
- Listen. That chair, that squeaky chair,

912
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,916
and everything in here,

913
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,333
in this fabulous old dump, is all ours.

914
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,875
- We're business owners.
- Mm-hmm

915
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,750
[Roxy] That's got a nice ring to it.

916
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,208
[yelling] That's my Roxy!

917
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,666
- One, two. [chuckles]
- [laughs]

918
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,125
[inhales] Well, staff starts tomorrow,
and we got a week to get up and running.

919
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,291
It's the Holiday Rush

920
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:13,500
- with Rush Williams on Krush BQL.
- Mm.

921
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,125
[phone ringing and vibrating]

922
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,083
[Roxy] Roxy Richardson.

923
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,541
Oh, hey, Chuck.

924
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,791
What?

925
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,625
We were counting on you.

926
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,958
Yeah, but how far back do we go?

927
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,208
Yes, we helped you launch
that first donut shop.

928
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,750
What?

929
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,625
Huh.

930
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,166
Okay, I understand.

931
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,125
[call ending beep]

932
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,000
[chair squeaking]

933
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,083
It just got cold outside.

934
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,791
Marshall and CamCom
have threatened our advertisers.

935
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:03,583
Marshall?

936
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,583
We can't broadcast
without advertisers, Rush.

937
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,333
We can't...

938
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,458
We can't?

939
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,166
It's actually kinda dope
that they're seeing us as a threat.

940
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,500
We ain't played one song yet,

941
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,263
and they're already trying
to shut us down.

942
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,451
But it's not going to happen.

943
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500
It's not.

944
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:29,458
Roxy.

945
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,041
[hesitant] Rush?

946
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,875
Do me a favor. Come here.

947
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,309
I just want you to step into my office
for a second, please.

948
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,958
- [playfully scoffs]
- Just have a seat.

949
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,541
Now, I know I get a little sidetracked,
but check this out.

950
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,791
- [phone clatters on desk]
- [chair squeaking]

951
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,833
Let's take it one step further.

952
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,583
Commercial-free Christmas.

953
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:50,875
Can you see it?

954
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,041
You know what? I can see it.

955
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:03,333
And, I mean, we don't have a choice,
[laughs] but we can market it like we do.

956
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:05,041
- Fake it till you make it.
- Okay?

957
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,875
- Yes.
- WBQL...

958
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:11,250
Oh. "Nothing but Christmas." [gasps]

959
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:15,000
It's like a gift to your listeners,
billboards with your face.

960
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,333
That's gonna get their chestnuts roasting,
ain't it?

961
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,916
[sharp inhale] I... [clears throat]

962
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,958
Okay, let me run these numbers,

963
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,250
but with the money
coming in from your house,

964
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,083
we should be able to operate
without new revenue for a little while.

965
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,375
Until the ratings come in,
and the listeners come in,

966
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,208
and then advertisers will be running
to buy airtime.

967
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,708
- Yes.
- This is a short-term loss

968
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,291
- for long-term gain.
- Yes, it is. Yes.

969
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:41,208
This is... [stammers]
You know what I got to do?

970
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:46,125
- What you got to do?
- I got to go and start getting these kids

971
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,791
into this kinda holiday feeling.
I got to...

972
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,267
- Okay. [laughs]
- I don't know, man.

973
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:54,541
I want them to feel that Christmas spirit,
you know what I mean? Can you feel it?

974
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,142
- I can feel it.
- [funky music playing]

975
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:59,875
[playfully drawn out]
I'm saying, Roxy, can you really feel it?

976
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,708
- [laughing]
- [Rush] Make you want to, uh! [laughs]

977
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,750
[screaming laughter]

978
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,916
Hey, thank you.

979
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:09,708
[gruff exhale]
All right, I'll call you later.

980
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,642
- [laughs] Okay.
- [Rush] Trying to shut us down.

981
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,833
And I'ma whoop Marshall's butt
when I see him.

982
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:14,750
[laughing]

983
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:18,666
- [funky "O Come O Come Emmanuel" playing]
- [Rush] I'm thinking, if it was up to me,

984
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,190
we would get a little table top tree

985
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,101
- like this.
- [Mya] Uh, no! No, I like that one.

986
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,017
[Rush] No, you got to meet me
in the middle somewhere.

987
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,541
- [Mya] come on!
- [Gabby] That one.

988
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,684
- [Rush] I...
- [man] Really?

989
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:28,642
- [Rush] Wait...
- [Gabby] Yeah, of course that one!

990
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,458
- [Mya] No.
- [Rush] Wait a minute. Hold on.

991
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,309
- [Evie] Totally that one.
- You're in charge.

992
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,893
- Don't let them get in trouble.
- [Mya] All right, keep looking.

993
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,583
[feet crunching snow]

994
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:41,791
Principal Peters calls me and tells me
that you've been cutting classes.

995
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,333
[Jamal scoffs]

996
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,708
You know, Harvard doesn't like that.

997
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:51,750
You see, it's funny you think
Harvard's still happening.

998
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,208
What, you don't?

999
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, well, I just figured
it's one of the big sacrifices.

1000
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,083
Jamal, don't give up on yourself, son.

1001
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,791
Why not? You did.

You're looking at disadvantaged youth.

no prospects, none!

- Was.

1005
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,625
[Mya] Now, about this tree...

1006
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:25,541
See, you have a little wiggle room?
Through these scrawny branches.

1007
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:28,666
[Rush] Oh, whoa. Hey, now, look,
I hate to crisp your Kringle,

1008
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,875
my darling daughter,
but we agreed on a smaller tree this year.

1009
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,375
[scoffs] Sorry. Excuse me.

1010
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:37,916
Dad, I got this chump on the hook.

1011
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,958
I am sure you do, Mya...

1012

Listen, buddy,

1013
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:45,083
[stammering] what about that six-footer
right over there?

1014
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:46,750
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1015
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,958
- Sure.
- Oh, joy!

1016
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,583
Yeah. Hey, Jamal.

1017
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,208
It's Christmas, man.

1018
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,345
This is our thing, it's what we do.
We pick out a tree for our house.

1019
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,666
It's not my house.

1020
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,958
Don't be like that, man.

1021
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,708
My house is in Whitestone.

1022
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:06,625
With a big tree,
and big potential, and a big future.

1023
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,208
And you made damn sure that's over.

1024
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,791
You go sit your ass in the car, okay?

1025
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:16,000
And I'ma go make some Christmas memories.

1026
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,833
[scoffs] Whatever.

1027

for Christmas Mass. Me?

I'll be stuck picking through the bins
at Bargain Mart for some holiday sparkler.

1036
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,416
How's that supposed to make me feel?

1037
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,250

who wasted all that money

[sighs] You don't want me to be happy.

1042

That's not it at all!
I'm just saying, hmm?

Over my dead body.

1044

Dad! This is hard.

1045

Ugh! I can't with her.

1050
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:13,851
- Can you just be happy for her?
- Without being sad for myself.

1051

You know, I remember this one Christmas.

1098
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:36,291
I was seven,
and it was the year my folks divorced,

1099
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:39,833
[laughs] and they couldn't afford
separate houses.

1100
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,809
- So they drew a line and split the house.
- [playful instrumentals]

Mom upstairs, Daddy downstairs.

- [Roxy] It was like a war zone in there.

1103
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,750
And then, on Christmas Eve, um,

1104
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,041
Daddy had the house,
and we were celebrating,

1105
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,500
and he snuck into my mom's room

1106
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,000
to get his Santa costume
out the back of her closet,

1107
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,750
and my brother got so freaked out
that he was trespassing

1108
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,875
that he called Mom
and she called the cops.

tiptoeing in in his Santa costume
to the front of the house,

1112

You gotta get that Christmas tree
leaning up against the garage in here,

Christmas tradition.
That thing stays outside for three days.

1131
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:08,166
The only reason that tradition started
is because you and your mother

1332
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,375
Let that young man go.

He's going through something.
I don't know what it is.

1335
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:58,250
Yeah, he's going to learn some respect,
though!

1336
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:01,291
You know how many times
I didn't run after you?

Give me a call back, Ma. Thanks.

It's not over.

1345

For CamCom, it is.

1346
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,541
You see, we are a big company.

1347
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:43,250
You ever had your shares
in a big, big, big company?

FCC rules say that we can't just snap up
that little twig of a station.

1350

We're all maxed out
in this market. [chuckles]

1351
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,168
Guess we're just going to have
to take our chances

1352
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,458
and see what numbers Rush pulls.

1353
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,583
Yeah, yeah, then there's that.

[playful scoff] Well, then, that's that.

1355
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:10,875
Then I... How did Barton put it?
I have failed to secure market viability.

1356
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:17,583
So, if our shares are going to shrink,
we might as well drink.

[stammers] Are you okay?

1361
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1362
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,541

I like that business.

and run through the show,
'cause we go on at 4:00.

1372
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:57,469
All right, let's check it. Here we go.
We'll be like, "What up, y'all!

That don't work. I like this. How about,
"What up, y'all? It's Rush Holiday.

You can play whatever you want.
You want to know why?

01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:23,098
You know what we got going on up in here?

1383
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:25,500

Over! Over! Over! Merry damn Christmas.

1391
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,291
The bank just called,
our line of credit just got yanked!

1392
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,583
[Roxy] How did that happen?

1393
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:45,833
The buyers for Rush's house pulled out.

1394
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,416
- Are you sure?
- [exhales] We can't broadcast.

1395

We can't broadcast. Can't pay anybody.

1396
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:53,750
We can't even be in this building!
As of right now, we're trespassing!

1397
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,041
Okay. Okay...

1398
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:58,000
- I think I hear sirens.
- We paid for this building.

1399
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,923
The credit line was just to get us through
until the ad money kicked in.

And you know he loves you.

going after this dream.
