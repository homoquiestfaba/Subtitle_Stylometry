You are special forces

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,800
Someone took this guy apart!

17
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Look at you!

18

Now you're  just a murderer.

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,600
The guy that car-jacked my wife.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,200
You're going away for a long time, tough guy.

RAJ VARDHAN VARMA

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry, so very sorry.

23
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,000
I know I promised to wait for you
but I can't wait any longer.

24
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,100
Its been 6 years.
I need to move on...

25
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,200
I need to get my life back.

26
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
I love you so much.

27
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,200
Get out of here, Daniels.
bid day is tomorrow.

28
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,000
Counsel I take it that you all are ready?

29
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,300
We are..your honour I believe
you have a recommendation in front of you

30
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,700
As you read the prosecution has filed
for a dismissal of charge against my client.

31
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,400
and because of that we will expect certain details
to be included in the record when his record is expunged.

32
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,600
And what are those?

33
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,000
that a weapon, one that matches the ballistic's profile

34
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:34,001
of the one used in the initial murder
was recovered in the possession of another subject

35
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,900
..that the DNA of said subject matches the DNA
that was recovered in the initial murder investigation.

36
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,600
All of this was brought to light with the
help of the partict's innosence.

37
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,000
DNA was never admitted in the original trial?

38
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
OK !!

39
00:05:57,101 --> 00:06:00,501
I find sufficient evidence to support the dismissal...

40
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:02,902
..of any and all charges against the defendant.

41
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,800
also the state will award Mr. Daniels $300,000.

42
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,100
$50,000 for each year Mr. Daniels
has erroneously incarserated

43
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,900
I trust you are satisfied
with that, Mr. Daniels.

44
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,200
Your honour...I gave 14 years
of my life in the military.

45
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
6 years hard time in a federal penetentionary,

46
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know why you people think
that.. money, can replace a life.

47
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,300
There are no words to describe..

48
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:42,401
What it's like when you..
an innocent man in prison

49
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,100
sitting there and waiting and hoping
and praying that this day would come.

50
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,500
I don't believe that money
can buy back my name,

51
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,800
my reputation, my wife,
my family and all that I lost.

52
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,600
Mr. Daniels, the court
recognizes your grief

53
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,800
and we sympathize with your loss

54
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,400
I don't want your money!
I want my life back.

55
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,600
Take him to the safe house

56
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,900
A nice lady like you needs
a nice car like this.

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't think it really matters anymore.

174
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,900
At your joy may off just tell
the cops whatever you want

175
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,200
Just give me a few hours to get into the wind.

176
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,800
Oh! my father'll disown me if I spoke
to the cops. Specially the ones from Bellinghams

177
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,300
Is your father a gangster or something?
...ex-con?

178
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,400
No! its like I said that my father is not
exactly an outstanding citizen.

179
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Mean he sells cars that aren't
necessarily for sale, if you know what I mean

180
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,500
I can relate to that.

181
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Hey! Welcome back!

182
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,900
I won't do that if I were you.
going by 70 miles per hour

183
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,100
Its okay we saved you
from those guys back there.

184
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,901
I mean we don't mean you any harm

185
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,700
- Which means we were harmed
- hey tecnically he did

186
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,800
I didn't drive the car though, are you going
with him? is she going with you?

187
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,900
Man I say just drop her off at the first cofee shop
- No.

188
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,400
- I can't go to the local police.
- no why's that?

189
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,000
They're the ones who killed my friends
- Damn .

190
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,600
Look I need to call my father.
- Not till we reach Bellingham.

191
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,100
Then you are free to do whatever you want.
-But I need help didn't you hear me?

192
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,500
The cops killed my friends

193
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,600
My father will pay if you help me.
- the problem is I don't need money.

194
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,800
I've whole bag of cash here.

195
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,500
May be instead of money your dad can get me
the f**k out of America. Could he do that?

196
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,900
He can
-Yeah, well ...

197
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,700
If you are so sure about that,
I tell you what son

198
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,900
Drop her and I off together and then you park this
piece of shit somewhere where nobody could see it and uhh

199
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,700
Hide it untill the fallen moon
maybe I can help I know the town really well.

200
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,100
My father's got connections.

201
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,300
Just forget about us man.. do what I say.

202
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Nice.

203
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Now you're hero.

204
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,700
Lay that dead kid so looks like the ching killed him first

205
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,100
I want this hold thing tied up by the
tenstake boys got here

206
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,000
You got it.

207
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,700
I'd love a beer kid.

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,000

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,100

between yourself and your car .

213
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,401

214
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
All right, man be safe.

215
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,400
Thanks.

216
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,000
Where are you going?

217
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,700
- I Thought we were...
-Yeah! no, we're not going there. Come on.

218
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,201
Wait... Wait for me

219
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Here? ...Why?
- it gets the kid is more f**ked

220
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,901
...and from him they will back to the other motel
you understand?

221
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,400
You don't trust anyone, do you?
- It ain't about trust, its about survival.

222
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,300
Look, I need to call my father.

223
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
I need to tell him I'm okay.

224
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Before you do that,
I think you and I need to have a little talk.

225
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,200
I already told you everything.
what more do you want me to say

226
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,800
You told me that your friends
were killed by local cops

227
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,100
that really doesn't explain to me how you ended up
in the trunk next to the bag of cash

228
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
I've already told you that was not my money.
what are you... deaf?

229
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,500
I want you to shut the f**k up!

230
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,700
I want you to pay attention and
to understand one thing

231
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,400
if I'm gonna try to save you and if I'm
gonna try to help you

232
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,600
you need to talk to me,
you need to listen to what I say..

233
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:14,901
..when I say, how I say

234
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,500
and if you don't, I will leave you here
to get eaten by the f**kin jackasses

235
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,100
..who're coming soon.

236
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:23,201
Okay

237
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,500
OK. I'm Sorry.

238
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,500
if you want me to help you,
you gotta talk to me man.

239
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,700
you gotta tell me straight so I can know who's
coming for us

240
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,600
you're right.

241
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,000
You saved my life.

242
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,000
I guess I owe you the truth.
- I hope the truth would be nice.

243
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,600
I was trying to get my uncle into the country.

244
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:55,601
Here are they...coming now

245
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,000
I was contacted by someone
who said they could help.

246
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,600
They wanted me to go inside alone.
- I don't like this Tia

247
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
I'll be okay.

248
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,800
I was told to shop alone,
but I insisted on bringing some of my friends.

249
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,800
since it was the first time we were meeting.

250
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,700
the man I met is a chinese drug smuggler

251
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,900
only known to me as Chen.

252
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,700
He told me that you would help
smuggle my uncle into the United States

253
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,000
I should 've known it was a trap.

254
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,500
it was all my fault.

255
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
I heard the shots.

256
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,100
I was in shock

257
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,800
they forced me into a room where
another man was waiting for me

258
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
he said that he was waiting for my uncle's arrival.

259
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,800
And that I was going to be helpful ransom

260
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,300
untill he got the information that
he needed from my uncle.

261
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
and then someone placed a cloth in my mouth.

262
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,700
Why would your father send you alone
to do this kind of thing?

263
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,100
he did'nt, I went against his wishes.

264
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,800
It was his preference to keep trying to get
my uncle here through legal channels.

265
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,600
you see I love my uncle and I had
to make sure that he escape from China.

266
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,300
escape from China?
- My uncle is an accountant.

267
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,000
He wanted to go, but its not
a kind of job you can just quit

268
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,100
my uncle is involved with some senior members
in the Chinese army

269
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,000
these men are incharge of an area
known as the Golden Triangle.

270
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,400
a place in Burma, where the popeye's are cultivated.

271
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,600
sounds very familiar...very familiar

272
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,900
that's why he was denied entrance in the U.S..

273
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,400
So he is on the watchlist.
-Yes.

274
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,700
If he was an accountant that means
he knows where all the books are

275
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,200
What all the numbers are...

276
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,200
..where all the bodies are...
they're not got to let him go.

277
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
that guy is worth his weight in gold

278
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
but he is a good man, Shane.

279
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,900
and the man in the office..he is also Chinese?
they called him the "Colonel".

280
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,100
Chinese military, am I to say that?

281
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,200
My father was a military adviser.
I've been around the type my whole life.

282
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,500
he asked me some questions about my uncle.

283
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,000
almost like he was trying to make
sure I was who I said I was

284
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,900
I get it

285
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,200
I know what to do

286
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:45,701
...I know what to do

287
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Richie..its Clark..come in

288
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,101
Go on Richie..over!

289
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
I think we've got it
- ok, hang in there I'll be right there in 10.

290
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,500
where is my money?

291
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,401
..Where is my money

292
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,700
My money.
-What?

293
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,100
your money?

294
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
no..no..no the deal was-
I get half the money upfront

295
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,300
the other half when I give you the uncle.

296
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,200
that was my f**king money!

297
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,600
until he arrives its my money.

298
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,600
and that girl ...
I need her to control the uncle

299
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,900
and you lost her too
- and I'm gonna get her back

300
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,100
you forget, the girl was a bonus.

301
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,300
you better deliver this bonus

302
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,100
if you want to do business with my backers
you need to be a little more responsible.

303
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Yeah! you Find Them!
or you take care of it!

304
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,900
I gotta go.

305
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,100
He angry?

306
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,600
Chen! Please, I did my best.

307
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,100
Who has my money?
- It was my fault boss

308
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,200
What the f**k?
now answer my f**king question:

309
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,900
Who has my money?

310
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,300
and more importantly, where is the girl?

311
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,200
...is a big guy, may be INDIAN
I dont know

312
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,200
he took the money...
and he took the girl

313
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,800
the girl might remember how to get back here.
we should go to the safe house

314
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,400
we have plenty of unknowns.

315
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,800
state cops have to go through Bellingham
before they get here.

316
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,900
what about the dead trooper?
-Ritchie should have handle on that, right?

317
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,400
"Yeah."
-local cops are in my pocket.

318
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,700
Ritchie says he found the abandoned car
he'd send her uptown.

319
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,500
he also said prints on the outside of the car
belong to a dead Russian kid

320
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,300
Russian?

321
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:26,801
Yeah

322
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,800
Russians..
Damn!!

323
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,500
Ok...well you make sure Ritchie
has the description of this Indian guy

324
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,000
you send'em to the Russians
and get'em to talk to him

325
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,901
then you grab a few men
and you start searching the town.

326
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,700
nobody leaves without us knowing

327
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,600
Understood?
get the f**k outta here

328
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
bleed now out of my office!

329
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,800
Russians and Indians...Hmm!!

330
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,900
Chen says that the Russians are hiding this guy
you better make them give him up

331
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,300
Awright

332
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,900
Got it?
-Understood

333
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:20,801
I hate tell the Lo Chen

334
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,100
Dimitri, two more
-Ok..coming right up

335
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,500
Yes! go on..

336
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,700
yeah nothing lag back to us,
covered our tracks, covered the vehicle

337
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:42,201
I mean we were just minding our own businesses

338
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,600
a cop pulled up and...huh!
we were little freaked so..

339
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,200
you know how suddenly the other 2 guys
get out and come out of nowhere

340
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
my cuff heads off down in the dark
and dock for cover

341
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:55,401
he should've stayed low..
..he should've stayed low

342
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,700
Hey!..who is the guy in-charge here?

343
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,200
so the guy comes out of nowhere I dont know
he seemed to help me out of situation so

344
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:04,601
just...can't cope with it

345
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,800
I'm looking for the driver of a blue sub-urban

346
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,301
people around here tell me you deal in cars

347
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,400
no.

348
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,300
people probably tells you lesser things...hmm!

349
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
but I bet most of it..bullshit

350
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,800
Why don't you go back to your side of town
cowboy?

351
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,900
we try keep to ourselves here
isn't that right?

352
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,700
see... no one's here wants to whisper
when a cop is here.

353
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,800
some euro trash just by your age
got himself killed down by the border-line.

354
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,900
did you know him?
- Well I don't know any Euro-Trash...officer!

355
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,700
I'm trying to finish my meal here

356
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,601
but I don't easily can do that
with you standing here.

357
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,300
smells of you makes my stomach turn.

358
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,400
I will...cut your balls and then they'll
cut your throat. You understand?

359
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
you know I'm a cop! we are f**kin' cops

360
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,200
let me explain something to you...

361
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:42,301
where I come from, we...f**k cops in the
mouth when we are an out of form animals

362
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,900
If you want to hook us up
after you count you're dead

363
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,301
then don't forget...

364
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,700
that American chills
is paradise to us.

365
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,500
so think hard
before you jump.

366
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,100
We need this cleaned up.
- Right.

367
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,600
what the f**k was that?

368
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,001
what we're just gonna walk away
that asshole just threatened you

369
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,400
listen to me, we walk away for right now
right...this is their polytown

370
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,200
Oh! gimme a break
- this f**k is a crazy?

371
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,100
we can't take them all, not the 2 of us not right now
-We're the f**king law

372
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Listen to me!

373
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:10,501
As soon as we handle this shit
I'm planning on paying 'em a little home visit.

374
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,300
O Yeah! there's a place and a time for everything.

375
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,700
now get in the f**king car!

376
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,500
So...this is your money.

377
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,500
unfortunately..I don't know if you can read Chinese but,

378
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,900
its obviously Chinese drug money.

379
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:43,901
So..

380
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,200
I'm sure folks are...looking for this
real hard

381
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,100
Who are you?
I mean, how do you know that?

382
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I...was in the military for a long time

383
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,700
was in the army special forces.
I had a great career, very colourful

384
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,600
one day I lost it all

385
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,100
got accused of some I didn't do
did 6 years hard time.

386
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,200
was acquited of all wrong doing through

387
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:10,901
DNA evidence, they found out I had nothing to do
with the crime

388
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:13,202
I was let out recently...and...

389
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,800
look at me, I'm already in trouble again.

390
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,900
F**k!

391
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,000
this is a transponder...

392
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:40,800
which means people are probably
closin' in on us real quick you know

393
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,200
Get down, somebody's here

394
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,600
Let's go

395
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Oh! God, I think I'm going really sick.
- do while you rally

396
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,500
My Uncle is due to arrive today

397
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm so worried about what might have
happened to him

398
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,700
awright.

399
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,700
How you doin?

400
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,300
here we have a young man called Serghey?

401
00:44:57,901 --> 00:44:58,901
I've never heard of him.

402
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,500
he said that his father owns this place
somewhat called Vlad.

403
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,900
news to me

404
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:06,301
really?

405
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:07,902
okay.

406
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,400
Thank you.

407
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,900
lets go this is a waste of time.

408
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,000
Wait a minute..

409
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:28,701
this is them, those are Chen's men

410
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,600
why don't you tell me what business
you've got with Serghey?

411
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,700
poor boy owes me some money
you check with the father

412
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,700
What's in the bag?
- None of your f**kin' business.

413
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Little Russia, everything my business.

414
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,800
oh! how bad do you want to find out
what's in the bag, boy?

415
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,500
Who are you?

416
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,801
Where is he...huh?

417
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:23,402
Monsieur! Monsieur!

418
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,900
Okay let's go see your boss

419
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,300
Son of a bitch!

420
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,900
This guy is ain't with us and
whoever took him out is a professional

421
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,100
found this.
weren't we just there there?

422
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,500
so the motel's surveillance cameras
gave us a tentative ID

423
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:19,101
Guy's name is Shane Daniels he is just out enjoying

424
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,100
and guess what...

425
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,700
He is ex-special forces.
the guy is a f**king killing machine

426
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,400
still doesn't explain me why he screwed the asians
oh! you'll gonna love this

427
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,100
we found some kind of
tracking device in the room too.

428
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,100
may be my friend is being a little less than honest.

429
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,300
we both can come back to kill that piece of shit

430
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,800
No... I can handle him

431
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,800
So both ends of town are truly covered

432
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,900
then he's got to be somewhere close

433
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:46,701
no we slipped down to the Russians main docking

434
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,900
but our guy was there.

435
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,900
well then you take the gloves off and
you make the Russians talk!

436
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,600
sure you want to go there?

437
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,600
they went their first

438
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,200
Colonel...!

439
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,300
the man we're looking for, killed 2 da doo

440
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,700
do you want to know anything about it would you?

441
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:11,401
No I don't

442
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,500
liar!
-think before you act.

443
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,401
I am thinking

444
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,100
and I think those men were yours
and they were after my money.

445
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,500
You deliver it, and then you're trying to steal it back
-you are thinking too much.

446
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,800

447
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,200

-I still don't have the girl

448
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,900

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,700

450
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,600
Now please...contact your people
and tell them to deliver my money

451
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,700
of course.

452
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,100
Shit!

476
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,200
I heard a...a rumor about a Da Doo.

477
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,100

00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,500

00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,000

489
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Come sit down to daddy

490
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,800
I owe this man my life father

491
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,200
life we find coarse for many things

492
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,300
we fight for our family, for our friends,
and for our pride...

493
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,900
but always maintain the code of honor

494
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,000
Without that, life has no meaning
-I understand that.

495
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,600
 Where's your family?
- My family's gone.

496
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,200
I see that in your eyes

497
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:08,401
You're the man who put others ahead of himself

498
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,200
not to garner other's respect but simply
because it's your very nature

499
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,400
you saved my son and for that I am
beyond grateful.

500
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,400
Please tell me what you need
if it's within my power I'll make it happen.

501
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,300
I don't like to start a fight unless I finish it and...

502
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,900
after this now they have her uncle and if
we don't step in they'll kill him

503
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,300
That is a serious problem.

504
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,900
where was this place they had you?
-It was an abandoned mill

505
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,400
about 50 miles out of town
not too far from the border.

506
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,300
the Chen's place...very secluded
he likes to do business over there

507
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,800
so you know this man
- of course.

508
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,400
What do you think?

509
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,500
from now on you are my brother.

510
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,600
You son of a bitch
-You should be dead by now.

511
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,400
I just wanted to make sure the uncle arrives
before you screw that up too

512
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,300
my associates...will retaliate

513
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,900
you know they...they rely on me
to deliver their product across.

514
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,500
there's...there's a lot of money at stake here.

515
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,200
you think you matters...hmm?

516
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,100
you think I was going to pay you...huh?

517
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,500
the only reason I came to you...

518
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,400
to intercept the uncle, was because
you were easy to manipulate.

519
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,600
And I was right.
-you think you've done doo background on training?

609
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,900
well unfortunately in the fabricating of your plans

610
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,001
you in advently stepped in into my minefield

611
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,300
And to answer the second part of your question

612
01:22:49,101 --> 01:22:50,001
I want you dead.

613
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,100
I did not believe you were that good
untill you dispatch my men

614
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,500
Very impressive!

615
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,600

616
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,400

you know brother where I come from...

619
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,101
the definition of death is emptiness

620
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,200
If that's the case...

621
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,100
I've been dead for a long long long time

622
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:17,301
Hmm!!

623
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,500
well looks like we're in a room with 3 dead men

624
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,900
let's go!

625
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,100
Come on, somebody wants to see you.

626
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,500
O where...where is Shane?
- he is coming...he is coming ok.

01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,600

629
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,100
everybody's waiting for us downstairs

630
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,300
I've got something more important than that.

631
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,300
smuggling days are over that's for sure

632
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:15,001
does that mean what I think it means?

633
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,700

your uncle can stay.

634
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,900

635
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,800
