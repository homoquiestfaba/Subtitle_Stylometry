crazy about his work.

You're so nice.

No wonder he took such trouble
to plan something
very special for you.

Is it done?

I just put
the finishing touch
on before I left.

properly gift-wrap it yet.

you know, and that

dreadful asthma
finally took him from us.

had never had,

till I met Ronnie.

Why didn't you sell
Ashley Motors to
that German syndicate?

142

Trevor had already left me
a fortune.

143

What did I need
with another one?

144
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,060
What you needed was me.

145
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,070
Absolutely.

146
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,160
What you don't need
is Ashley Motors.

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,020
It takes up too much of your
time and energy.
Hmm...

148
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,070
You mean it takes up
too much time and energy
that could go towards you.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,130
Jonathan,

150
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,100
weren't you interested in
buying my company once?

151
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,150
I gave you an offer
you could refuse,

152
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,190
and you did.

153
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,110
Are you still interested?

154
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,190
Why?

155
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,200
Have you changed your mind?

156
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,070
No, just

157
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,220
testing the waters.

158
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,110
Jennifer and I don't need
Ashley Motors, either.

159
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,130
Of course not.

160
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,060
You've got it all.

161
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,010
We have each other.
That's what counts.

have the wrong number.

Oh, just some lunatic
on the loose.

when one's a celebrity,
one must expect it.

Would you get the bill?
I'd like to go.

us one day.

my pen, Detective?

That's a present
from a very special friend.

It was in the car.

might want to steal?

KURT: Don't think so.

381
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,100
Its value is only personal.

382
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,010

Did you see who stole it?
We couldn't.

I suppose you'll want us
to go down to headquarters

already did enough
for me and the kids.

who it was

and why,

Vivienne?

wouldn't you?

I don't know.

anything for him

are different.

with the wrong man

when I thought he loved me.

And now you don't believe
that anymore.

using me.

1072
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,060

she said before she fell.

Maybe I should take you
home, hmm?

That's a good idea, Kurt.

1078
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,030
I think I have to be
by myself now.

1079

Oh, I have to give you
the last envelope.

1080
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,190
Oh, that's unnecessary
right now.

1081
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:50,120
Yes, I do. That's what
Uncle Max wanted.

1082
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,140
Well, we'll come
and pick it up.

01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,010
I wonder what Vivienne
did with the clock.

1087
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,050
Vivienne had the clock?

1088
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,090
That's what she said.

1089
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:09,110
Maybe it wasn't Vivienne
who wanted the clock at all.

1090
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,130
Maybe it was Ronnie
who wanted it.

1091
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,050
Interesting idea.

1092
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,220
Maybe Camilla's suspicion
wasn't so wrong.

1093
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,150
Maybe it's like Kurt's car.

1094
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,000
Vivienne wasn't trying
to steal the car,

1095
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,090
she was trying to steal
the clock that was in the car.

1096
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So...

1097
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,130
Maybe it's not the clock that
everyone and their brother
is after, after all.

1098
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,030
Maybe it was something
that was in the clock.

1099
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,070
What if we invite Camilla
and Ronnie to dinner?

01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,200
Hey, Ronnie...

1246
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,120
We travel, too, huh?

1247
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,180
London, Paris, Rome...

1248
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:59,210
Just like you.

1249
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,190
You call the police, Kurt?

1250
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah, just as you asked.

1251
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:09,000
I told you, don't move.

1252
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,180
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1253
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,210
Darling, are you all right?

1254
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,030
Yeah, I'm all right.
Kurt?

1255
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,200
Yeah, I'm okay.

1256
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,110
What about you?
I'm fine,
but you don't look so fine.

1257
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,210
He's got quite a punch.

1258
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,080
And a pretty good kick, too.

1259
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,080
And in the dark.

1260
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,050
RONNIE: Let's get outta here.

1261
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,060
DETECTIVE: I'm sorry,
Lady Ashley,

1262
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,080
but your husband is wanted
for breaking and entering
and attempted murder.

1263
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:02,150
Attempted murder?

1264
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,030
Mr. and Mrs. Hart
and their artist friend

1265
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,170
said that he shot at them
late last night
and then ran away.

1266
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:11,090
I... I can't believe it.

1267
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,200
Why would he do that to them?

1268
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,050
We've come to take Mr. Scott
in for questioning.

1269
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,030
I'm very sorry, but

1270
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,050
my husband didn't
come home last night.

1271
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:29,080
You see, we haven't been
getting along very well lately
and...

1272
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,160
I doubt
whether he'll be back
at all.

1273
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,110
Ever.

1274
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:36,040
Yes, I do see.

1275
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,000
But I assure you that

1276
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,000
if he does come back,
I'll let your office know
right away.

1277
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,000
I know we're talking
about a person to whom
you're married, but...

1278
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,080
I must insist.

1279
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,010
Some people might be
reluctant, given such
a trusted relationship,

1280
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:59,210
but I've always believed
it's better not
to fight City Hall.

1281
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,050
As you've probably heard,
Lady Ashley,

1282
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,030
you can't.

1283
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,030
Good day.

1284
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:08,150
Good day.

1285
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,160
Thanks.

1286
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,040
You had me convinced.

1287
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,010
Maybe I should be taking
acting lessons from you.

1288
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,130
(SCOFFS)

1289
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:45,100
I think you ought to
take them from someone.

1290
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,100
I'd stay out of sight
if I were you.

1291
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,080
Why? This place is in
the middle of nowhere.

1292
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,070
They'd be watching this house
if it were in the middle
of Piccadilly Circus.

1293
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,100
You can't hide here.

1294
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,090
What are you saying?

1295
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,210
Are you throwing me
to the wolves?

1296
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,160
It doesn't hurt a wolf
to be thrown to the wolves.

1297
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,010
You've been having an affair
with that Vivienne creature,
haven't you?

1298
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:16,000
Camilla, she didn't mean
a thing to me.

1299
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,040
(SCOFFS)

1300
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,230
You stole an old passport
of mine from the safe.

1301
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,210
In England,
you gave it to her.

1302
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,200
You were going to
blackmail me.

1303
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:27,070
All right.

1304
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,170
I was scared.

1305
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:30,100
I thought you were gonna
leave me with nothing.

1306
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,020
Oh, you don't lie
convincingly, Ronnie.

1307
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,120
It was Vivienne who phoned me
the night of the book signing.

1308
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,140
Well, that was her
stupid idea.

1309
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,220
You're going to
double-cross her, too?

1310
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,110
Her shop was just
a convenient place for you

1311
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:47,180
to stash the stuff until you
put the bite on me.

1312
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,000
Then it was going to be
"Goodbye, Vivienne"

1313
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,180
until something went wrong.

1314
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,120
Well, you seem to have it
all figured out.

1315
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,150
Oh, yes.

1316
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,150
And now it's going to be
"Goodbye, Ronnie"

1317
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:02,040
and this time nothing is going
to go wrong

1318
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,100
because when I'm in control,
that's what happens.

1319
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,050
Well, you wouldn't want my
two employees here to

1320
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:11,050
mess up that beautiful face
of yours, now would you?

1321
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,070
Paul and Henri
are very good
at what they do.

1322
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:19,180
They may work for you,
but you work for me.

1323
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:22,160
I am your employer
and therefore theirs.

1324
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,050
Checkmate.

1325
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,080
Sorry, darling.
The boys work for me.

1326
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,200
We've always worked for her.

1327
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,050
You better stick
to your bad acting.

1328
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,130
(CHUCKLES)

1329
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,200
What are you gonna have
them do to me?

1330
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:42,090
Just take you to the airport.

1331
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,160
I don't want revenge, Ronnie.

1332
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,090
I just want you as far away
from me as possible.

1333
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,140
But you said you loved me.

1334
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,000
Oh, I did

1335
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,060
in my fashion.

1336
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,070
But being in love is a career
in itself.

1337
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,000
It takes up far too much
time and energy.

1338
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,160
And besides,

1339
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,000
I already have a career.

1340
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,080
Ashley Motors?

1341
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,040
That's really who you are,
isn't it?

1342
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:11,050
Absolutely.

1343
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,120
Ashley Motors is a metaphor
for my life.

1344
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,170
A long time ago,

1345
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,230
I decided to travel

1346
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,080
that open road
that most men travel.

1347
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,080
What's a metaphor?

1348
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,060
CAMILLA: Ask
your acting teacher.

1349
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,160
You should be grateful
to me, darling,

1350
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,040
that you're going away instead
of being slung in jail.

1351
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,180
(PHONE RINGING)

1352
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,120
Hello.

1353
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,050
Hello, Jonathan.

1354
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,170
Oh.

1355
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:54,170
Wha... How terrible.
How's Jennifer?

1356
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,010
BARTENDER: Here you are.

1357
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,120
Well, what's really important
about this ghastly experience

1358
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,000
is that you're both
in one piece.

1359
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,070
Two pieces.

1360
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,010
One and a half.

1361
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,190
I'm really shocked that Ronnie
could do such a thing.

1362
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:16,010
You know, I'm not talking
about attempted murder.

1363
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,040
Oh, no?

1364
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,090
CAMILLA: Oh, no.

1365
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:21,170
I told you I thought he was
capable of that,

1366
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:24,190
but breaking and entering?
That is really surprising.

1367
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:29,040
What's in the clock, Camilla?

1368
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,120
Jonathan.

1369
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,100
What a question.

1370
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,060
Only you've got the clock,
you should know.

1371
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,100
We only said that because
we wanted to see if Ronnie
would take the bait.

1372
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:41,010
JONATHAN: And he did.

1373
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,200
He bit. Hook, line
and sinker.

1374
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,200
Ah...

1375
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,020
So you don't have the clock?

1376
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,160
Well,

1377
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,200
I must say it's all terribly
intriguing, but then,

1378
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,030
anything you two do is always
terribly intriguing.

1379
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,160
We thought maybe
Ronnie told you
what was in the clock.

1380
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,040
Ronnie never tells
me anything.

1381
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,000
I never knew
why he wanted the clock,

1382
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,160
I certainly never knew
he was having an affair
with that woman.

1383
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,110
I don't even know where he is!

1384
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:15,060
He's completely disappeared.

1385
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,200
Well, now,
I must say, Camilla.

1386
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,030
You don't seem very upset
by his disappearance.

1387
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,080
You're right.

1388
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,020
I'm not.

1389
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,000
In fact, I'm relieved.

1390
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,030
Now I can leave Montreal
in peace.

1391
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:31,080
Yes, uh,
we're going to leave, too.

1392
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,110
Just as soon as we go and say
goodbye to those nice people
at the antique shop.

1393
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,180
Really?

1394
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,080
Yes. It does seem like
a waste of time,

1395
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,020
waiting around to see
if something turns up.

1396
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,030
I mean, it could be next week,

1397
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,070
next year,

1398
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,040
maybe never.

1399
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,060
Mm...

1400
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,080
Well, it's only been divine,
seeing you again.

1401
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:58,060
And if you do decide
to sell Ashley Motors,

1402
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,230
let me be the first
to get the call.

1403
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,210
It's a deal,

1404
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,080
but don't hang
by the thumbs, Jonathan.

1405
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,190
I can be almost as stubborn
as you can.

1406
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:10,050
Goodbye, Jennifer.
Goodbye, Camilla.

1407
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,050
This is too  triste.

1408
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,150
I hope everything
works out
the way you want it to.

1409
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:17,230
It usually does,

1410
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,070
and I hope the
same for you, too.

1411
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,070
Thank you for lunch
and  bon voyage, mes amis.

1412
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,060
Smart lady.

1413
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,140
What do you think?

1414
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,010
Maybe we hooked
another one.

1415
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,000
Paul? Henri?

1416
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,180
Did you see him
onto the plane?

1417
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,150
Yes.
Right.

1418
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:47,070
Well, now what I want you
to do is to watch
the Harts' hotel,

1419
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:49,170
and I want you to
check out the antique shop
and watch everyone

1420
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:52,060
very, very carefully.

1421
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,000
You think they suspect
why we want the clock?

1422
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,040
I'd stake my life on it.

1423
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,130
You don't know Jonathan
Hart like I do.

1424
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,110
We're very much alike.

1425
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:05,130
He never gives up
and neither do I.

1426
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,110
Even if I have to
have you kill them.

1427
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,120
Is it morning?

1428
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,140
Ah, did I wake you?

1429
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,180
What are you doing up?

1430
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,040
Just thinking about our clock.

1431
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,020
Oh, which reminds me.
What time is it?

1432
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,010
Early.

1433
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,180
It must be early
if Freeway's not up.

1434
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,110
Marie and Vivienne
used to say

1435
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:04,000
"The wind loves us"
when they rode the carousel.

1436
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,210
Marie said they used to
shout it to each other.

1437
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:11,170
That was the last thing
Vivienne said before she fell.

1438
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:15,170
I'll never forget it.

1439
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,220
What are you thinking?

1440
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:26,030
Well, I'm thinking that
maybe Vivienne was trying
to tell Marie something.

1441
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,230
Like

1442
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:31,060
where she had hidden
Kurt's clock.

1443
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:34,030
On a carousel?

1444
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,070
Well, in it
or under it

1445
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,180
or around it. I don't know.

1446
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,210
You wanna go visit
the amusement park?

1447
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:48,150
Do you think it's too early
to call Marie and ask her
to meet us there?

1448
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,150
Oh, not over this.

said goodbye to Camilla,

we might force her

understand how it would
leave an impression.

01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:50,070

that piece of advice when
