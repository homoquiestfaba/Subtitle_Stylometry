1
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,725
Everyone loves Halloween,

2
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,184
especially in Cleveland.

3
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,396
When you're known as
"The Mistake By The Lake,"

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,774
the chance to pretend you're somebody
else for a night sounds pretty good.

5
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,657
My dad grew up here, too.

6
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,286
His theory was, "No matter
what happens in high school,

7
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,372
"college is where you figure
out who you really are."

8
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,627
Not just some pretend-for-a-night
version of yourself, but the real deal.

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:33,050
He went to NYU after he graduated,
which is where l'm planning on going,

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:37,472
provided l can survive
the insanity that is my family.

11
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,935
I know.
Everyone thinks their family's crazy.

12
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,187
But trust me,

13
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,523
-you don't have...
-Albert!

14
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,983
...him.

15
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,378
Seriously?

16
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,052
Albert!

17
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,516
Where are my boobs?

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,521
Mom, Albert struck again,
that is twice this week.

19
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,648
Oh, hon, he wants to be close to you.

20
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,149
Well, that makes one of us.

21
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,026
Have you signed my application yet?

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,736
Application for what?

23
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,406
Afghan citizenship.
Hello? College loans.

24
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,325
Oh, right. No.

25
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,785
Oh, again with that jacket.

26
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,078
Why couldn't you have gotten attached

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,704
to something of your dad's
from this decade?

28
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,832
Mom. Application. Focus.

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,208
We need to talk about this, Wren.

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,460
l understand that
you want to go to NYU,

31
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,796
but Ohio State
is just much less expensive.

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,841
l know it's a lot of money
and l promise not to major in English

33
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,133
so l can help pay it off.

34
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,804
When my dad died,
my mom kind of lost it.

35
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,099
She started dyeing her hair bIonde,

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,684
shopping at Forever 21 ,

37
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:08,062
and going out with
a person named Keevin.

38
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,397
Oh, Joy.

39
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,609
M'lady.

40
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,779
M'dawg. Yeah.

41
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,867
Apparently, dating a 26-year-old

42
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,494
is one of the seven stages of grief.

43
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,502
Come on, Albert! Let's go!

44
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,884
So, which do you think,
sexy kitty or sexy mouse?

45
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,595
Can't you be a kitty without being sexy?

46
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,096
No.

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,181
Hello? Being sexy
is what's gonna get us

48
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,892
into Aaron Riley's party tonight.

49
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,352
We're never getting into
Aaron Riley's party.

50
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,437
We're not that cool.

51
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,522
lt's really sad that you're a pessimist.

52
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,357
Realist.

53
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,569
l read a statistic that
a good Halloween costume

54
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,864
can increase your chance
of popularity by 32%. So,

55
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,450
have you thought about
what you're going as yet?

56
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,370
l was thinking
maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

57
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,538
Huh?

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,415
We learned about her in Government.

59
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,335
Feminist icon? Supreme Court justice?

60
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,670
Aaron Riley is a musician.

61
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,297
He is not a law-abiding citizen.

62
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,382
He's not gonna know who that is.

63
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,302
What if l did a rap explaining who l am?

64
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,512
Stop. You're getting
your nerd juice all over me.

65
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,307
-Wren. Hey!
-Speaking of nerds. Oh, God.

66
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,309
-Hey, Roosevelt.
-Morning, ladies.

67
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,144
Happy Halloween. Right?

68
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,396
Albert, what's shaking, buddy?

69
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,482
Still not talking, huh?

70
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,817
Nope. Going on almost a year.

71
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,738
Thanks. Hey, this monster's
got some pretty big eyeballs.

72
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,365
That looks like your sweater.

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,034
My boobs. l'll take that.

74
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,287
So, what are you going as
for Halloween?

75
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,039
E.O. Wilson.

76
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,791
The father of sociobiology?

77
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,875
Exactly.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,627
You two are going
to costume jail for life.

79
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,379
Congratulations. You found someone

80
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,131
with a more obscure costume
than Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

81
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,008
Wait. You think it's obscure?

82
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,385
Hey.

83
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,846
Maybe you could do
an explaining rap, too.

84
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,810
I'm E.O. WiIson
and I'm a scientist

85
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,563
l study ants and stuff
if you get the gist

86
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,359
I'm about as cooI
as a guy can get

87
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,654
Think Jason Bourne
with a butterfly net

88
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,155
-Yeah !
-Right?

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,782
-That was good.
-lt's easy.

90
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,828
You could even do a stick bug dance
to really bring it home.

91
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,038
-Or you couldn't do that.
-Like one of these.

92
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,415
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

93
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,375
Don't. . . Don't do that.

94
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,585
-What? Don't do what?
-That.

95
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,879
Maybe you'll like
praying mantis better. Ready?

96
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,008
-Can you please stop it?
-You don't like that?

97
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,092
Wren, l said please.

98
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,427
The turtle is one
of my personal favorites.

99
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,221
Wren, please cut it out.

100
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,432
l'm gonna throw up.

101
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,100
Maybe this will make you feel better.

102
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,269
l don't even know
what kind of bug this is.

103
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,771
But what do you think about
these moves, April?

104
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,024
How am l looking now?

105
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,253
Aaron RiIey. God. Stud.

106
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,089
Legend.

107
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,178
Didn't know you could
move like that, Desantis.

108
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,931
You coming to my party tonight?

109
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,851
'Cause you should.

110
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,144
l should?

111
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,479
You should.

112
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,688
l should.

113
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,108
Maybe l'll play a song for you.

114
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,120
Wren. We're going
to Aaron Riley's party.

115
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,663
This is fully. . .

116
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,165
Albert!

117
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,667
He should not be off-leash.

118
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,383
Halloween just went from
another holiday l was trying to avoid

119
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,345
to possibly the greatest night of my life.

120
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,823
Okay, so now I reaIIy need
to figure out my costume,

121
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,535
because Ruth Bader Ginsburg
won't work.

122
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,870
What about sexy Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

123
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,665
No, that's weird.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
April's got dibs on wildlife.

125
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,471
And Aaron Riley always goes
as the star of his favorite movie.

126
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,723
Why not? They keep making sequels.

127
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,565
No. Not a chance.

128
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,654
Hey. Look, you love Spider-Man.

129
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,322
He looks like a Mexican wrestler.

130
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,328
Whatever. For once,
you're not my problem tonight.

131
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,806
Thanks to some
inspiration from Pink Floyd,

132
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,643
I got it. Dorothy, from The Wizard of Oz.

133
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,229
Not only is she an iconic female hero,

134
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,689
but she also provides a costume

135
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,691
that l happen to have in my closet.

136
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,619
Yellow brick road, here we come.

137
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,790
Oh, hey, Wren. What do you think?

138
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,794
l think people might misinterpret
what you mean by "trick or treat."

139
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,129
That's what you're taking Albert out in?

140
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,797
Oh, no, l forgot to tell you.

141
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,424
You're gonna watch Albert tonight.

142
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,593
l'm going to a party with Keevin.

143
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,637
A party? With Keevin?

144
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,513
Why are you saying his name like that?

145
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,724
lt's not even a name, Mom.
You're either Kevin or you're Steven.

146
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,267
Keevin does not exist.

147
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,145
Keevin does exist,
and he is kind and employed.

148
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,274
No, Mom, l did not agree to this.
Please?

149
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,526
Don't do this to me.

150
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,111
Honey, if you watch Albert tonight,

151
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,239
l'll sign the application
for NYU tomorrow.

152
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,241
And then this time next year,
you're gonna be

153
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,117
trick-or-treating the West Village!

154
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,578
l love you, thank you, you're welcome.

155
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,799
Happy Halloween, Spidey.
Aren't you adorable?

156
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,512
You have a lot to choose from.
Pick your favorite.

157
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,707
Honey! Honey,
l think we need more candy.

158
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,210
This sucks.

159
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,463
l can't believe we're missing the party.

160
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:36,427
How about this?
When's Albert's bedtime?

161
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,720
9:00.

162
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,639
But if he's riding a sugar high,
sometime next week.

163
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,148
Oh, my God, it's Aaron.
How did he get my number?

164
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,444
A smiley face emoticon?

165
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,987
We have to go.

166
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,823
lf we don't,
he'll move on to someone else.

167
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,659
My mom's been married three times.

168
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,745
Trust me, that is how love works.

169
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,122
Whose child is this?

170
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,373
Get over here.

171
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,792
Hi.

172
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,878
Does he belong to you?

173
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,256
He cleaned me out.
The sign says, "Take one."

174
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,259
Plus, l don't think
he needs the extra pounds.

175
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,595
Sorry, sir.

176
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,601
Albert, do you have any idea
what l sacrificed to be out here tonight?

177
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,062
Do we need to send you to rehab?

178
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,439
Okay, we're going to go
through the haunted house,

179
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,691
and then you're going to bed. Come on.

180
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,156
Damn ! l've never seen you like that.

181
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,493
l guess the pressure of being
a teen mom is getting to me.

182
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,286
-Roosevelt!
-Oh, my. . .

183
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,247
Hey, Peng.

184
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,457
Wren, hey.

185
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,000
What the hell are you?

186
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,338
l'm Aaron Burr, fool.
The dude who shot Alexander Hamilton.

187
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,840
Check it. Period gat.

188
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,425
Don't worry, it's just an antique.

189
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,928
l'm going to step outside.

190
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,305
So, Wren,

191
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,101
listen, l think it's really
cool that you don't

192
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,561
feel the need
to dress sexy on Halloween,

193
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,021
like some other girls.

194
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,942
Thank you, Roosevelt.

195
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,404
Well, l'd better catch up
with my brother.

196
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,240
So, you guys have a good night. Bye.

197
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:38,632
Albert?

198
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,304
Albert, l want to thank you.

199
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,224
lf it wasn't for you always doing stuff
like petting a dead cat,

200
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,393
l might never have found
the motivation to leave home.

201
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,145
You're not my mommy.

202
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,566
Bitch.

203
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,069
Albert?

204
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:07,786
Albert!

205
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,373
Albert.

206
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:29,725
Albert!

207
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,939
Albert.

208
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:46,492
Albert!

209
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,369
Albert.

210
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,538
Oh, thank God.

211
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,542
Hey! l'm not doing anything wrong.

212
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,794
This is 1 00% legal.

213
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,006
Yes, but very, very creepy.

214
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,842
Albert!

215
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,600
My mom is going to kill me.

216
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,482
Keevin Kilpatrick.

217
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,025
My oldest chum.

218
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,944
Nathaniel Brueder.

219
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,237
You've heard all about the lovely Joy.

220
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,821
-Hi.
-lndeed l have.

221
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,032
But you were wrong
about one thing, Keevin.

222
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,201
She's twice as beautiful as Katie Couric.

223
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,288
Oh, thank you.
She could be my mother, but

224
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,041
l love her and l think she's so brave.

225
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,711
Please, welcome, welcome.
Casa de Brueder.

226
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,297
l brought some wine.
Do you have a wine table,

227
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,799
or should l give this
to one of the servers?

228
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,676
You are a peach. My parents love wine.

229
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,053
You can chuck it in their
wine cellar downstairs.

230
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,805
Why are they here?

231
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,891
Because, duh, they live here.

232
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,811
Great people. You'll love them.

233
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,730
Come on. Everyone's down
in the Nate Cave. Race you !

234
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,695
Dude, l worked, like, 1 3 hours this week.

235
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,031
l don't know about you,
but l'm ready to cut loose!

236
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,670
Can you walk any faster?

237
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,673
No, l can't. We need a car.

238
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,175
l should call the police again.
Or the hospital.

239
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,677
Or maybe the pound.

240
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,305
This is bad, April.
This is really, really bad.

241
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,725
Oh, come on. What's the worst
that could happen to him?

242
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,436
Okay. How about this?

243
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,021
We split up.

244
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,273
Cover more houses.

245
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,027
Let me guess.
So you can go to the party.

246
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,196
-lt's at a house.
-Come on !

247
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,909
Well played, Galaxy Scout.

248
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,290
Hey, there, little man.

249
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,960
Whoa, that arm looks real bad.

250
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,880
Who was it? Green Goblin
or that lunatic, Dr. Octopus?

251
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,050
Venom? You must
have been freaking out.

252
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,470
What's happening?
Oh, yeah, of course.

253
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,221
You need to feed.

254
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,474
lt's very full already, but still. . .

255
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,559
Do you chew, bro?

256
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,645
That's disgusting to say.

257
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,313
Expecting?

258
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,856
Utility knife.

259
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,026
l don't know why we have so
many knives and safety pins.

260
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,028
You backed up in any way or. . .

261
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,365
Here we go.

262
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,034
Just mainline it, right?

263
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,410
l mean, don't really mainline it

264
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,580
because that would be intense. Hey.

265
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,084
You're that little kid
from the arcade, right?

266
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,295
Man, you are
an absolute beast at Mario Kart.

267
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,256
Wow, a living legend in my presence.
l am Fuzzy,

268
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,218
and you are Spidey. Of course.

269
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,761
Well, nice to meet you, Spidey.

270
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,930
Slushee's on the house.

271
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,057
Cool. Anyways. . .

272
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,476
Nice to meet you and everything

273
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,269
and stay in touch, man. Just don't. . .

274
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,438
lf you see me in the arcade,

275
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,817
say, "What's up?"
and l'll spot you some quarters,

276
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,819
'cause you got mad skills.

277
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:09,986
That went weird.

278
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,490
Oh, what's up, fellows?
Making an omelet?

279
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,575
Yeah, with a side of T. P.

280
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,828
-Who you hitting?
-Whoever has got it coming.

281
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,413
Tonight's all about revenge.

282
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,332
First on our list is
Stacy Lautner's house.

283
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,127
She said she'd be
my lab partner this year,

284
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,963
but first day of class,
she was sitting with David G.

285
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,299
Man, l feel your pain, brother.

286
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,718
Stay strong.

287
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,344
All right, man. Wish us luck.

288
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,971
Hey, we're sensitive guys, right?

289
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,431
Vengeance.

290
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,766
Yeah. Vengeance.

291
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,109
Vengeance.

292
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,531
Okay. All right.

293
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,130
What's up, Spidey?
You just chilling out here by yourself?

294
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,215
Okay.

295
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,136
Well, no man should ride alone tonight.

296
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,972
You don't have any friends or anything?

297
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,475
Look who's talking.

298
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,560
l tell you what.

299
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,646
l need a man for a mission.

300
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,817
One man for one mission
to avenge one broken heart.

301
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,154
Will it be dangerous?
Yes. Very much so.

302
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,782
ln fact, l'm quite scared about it.

303
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,534
Will we make it back alive?
l don't know, to be honest.

304
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,702
l do not know.

305
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,370
But l can promise you this.

306
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,540
He who follows me
unto the breach, my dear friends,

307
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,460
will be rewarded
with unlimited free Funyuns

308
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,670
for the rest of his life.

309
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,048
So, look.

310
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,676
l just feel like
we could help each other out tonight.

311
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,722
So what do you say, Spidey? Are you in?

312
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,560
Take your time.

313
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,694
Yep. Bam. Awesome.

314
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:15,946
Great news.

315
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,031
All right, so. . .

316
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,576
Just get in my car
and we'll roll, man, like homeys.

317
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,205
Not that l'm luring a kid into my car.

318
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,708
l'm not luring a kid into my car.

319
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,587
Let's check in here.
Albert's nursing a major Slushee habit.

320
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,465
Okay, seriously, what is wrong with you?

321
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,134
Okay, l wasn't going to bring this up,

322
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,970
but it has reached crisis stage.

323
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,722
l put Nair on my butt this morning.

324
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,141
Oh, my God, it is chafing
something fierce.

325
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,311
Here we go, Spidey.
The adventure begins.

326
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,021
lt was an accident.

327
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,149
-You Naired your butt?
-Yeah, and it burns.

328
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,734
Why in God's name would you do that?

329
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,987
lt's like fire shooting out of my ass.

330
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,031
Oh, nerd alert. Other way.

331
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,494
Please do not forget that
in our cross-ex.

332
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,621
Just chill, bro. lt's Spring Lake.

333
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,290
Follow me.

334
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,709
Roosevelt!

335
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,336
Peng ! Hey, guys, what's going on?

336
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,798
We were just actually
going over our strategy

337
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,924
for tomorrow's match.

338
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,677
-Fencing?
-Debate, actually.

339
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,679
First co-captains in school history.

340
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,223
-That's really cool.
-Wren?

341
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,437
So, how do you get to the big match?
ls there a team bus?

342
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,023
No, l drive my car.

343
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,192
Well, it's not my car,
but l can get permission.

344
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,529
So could you get permission tonight?

345
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:42,616
Tonight? You want me to drive the car. . .

346
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,119
You want me to drive, tonight, with it?
You in it?

347
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,247
What he was trying
to say is we would love to drive around

348
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,707
with you girls at night with no parents.

349
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,167
Great.

350
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,086
So, yeah. Let's. . .
Let's hit the road. Let's go.

351
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,380
The thing is. . .

352
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,800
l haven't fully completed
my trust window yet.

353
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,303
Your trust window?

354
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,473
lt's like a second learner's permit,
but between me and my moms.

355
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,476
You know, for six months,
l can't drive with anyone

356
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,854
outside my immediate academic
and/or social circles.

357
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,731
Oh, bummer. Let's go.

358
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,232
But. . .

359
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,236
We're friends.

360
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,641
My Crush.

361
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,813
lt's all over the floor.

362
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,606
You guys want to go?

363
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,775
We should go.

364
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,486
Prostitution.

365
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,497
Okay, come on in.
Shoes off, slippers on.

366
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,290
And please use your inside voices,

367
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,002
which, if you need a barometer,
is about where l am now.

368
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,754
No problem. So what's our cover?

369
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,464
We're debate team cheerleaders
or something?

370
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,757
No, it's okay.

371
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,135
You're my friends, you lost your brother.

372
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,970
l don't ever lie to my moms.

373
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,388
One more thing.

374
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,141
Do either of you carry
any sort of unusual scents

375
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,393
or chemical odors?

376
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,146
Really know how to smooth talk a girl.

377
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,940
l mean like scented lotions, perfumes.

378
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,401
Fragrances set off Tolstoy's asthma.

379
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,153
-Tolstoy?
-The cat.

380
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,196
He's a gray tabby. He's 1 2.

381
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,322
Really?

382
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,451
Wait. What about the Nair on your. . .

383
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,454
You-know-what.

384
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,915
Don't talk about my you-know-what
in front of them.

385
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,376
We love cats!

386
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,772
Roosevelt.

387
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,939
Hey, Moms.

388
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,026
l thought he was just talking
like Lil Wayne.

389
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,362
l didn't expect you home
until Charlie Rose.

390
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,282
Moms, this is Wren Desantis.

391
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,452
-Hi.
-And April. . .

392
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,162
April. . .

393
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,040
Martin-Danzinger-Ross.

394
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,043
The only thing my mom loves
more than men is hyphens.

395
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,756
So this is the Wren Desantis.

396
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,508
"The"?

397
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,843
l hear you're applying to NYU.

398
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,806
Yes, l think l mentioned that
to Roosevelt once.

399
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,140
Great school.

400
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,767
That's where Barb earned
her third doctorate.

401
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,851
Yeah.

402
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,978
-ln prenatal psychology. Yeah.
-Yeah.

403
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,731
l'm still in touch with the dean
through my heirloom bean club.

404
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,399
-Great guy.
-Oh, Earl.

405
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,526
-He's a lovely person.
-Yeah, he's a good guy.

406
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,944
He would write a letter in a heartbeat.

407
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,278
Oh, are you kidding me?

408
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,241
-Yeah.
-And very knowledgeable about beans.

409
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,451
l'm not sure where l am on chits. . .

410
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,913
Speak the Greek language.

411
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,542
lt's ancient Greek.
lt's just this fun thing we. . .

412
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,710
l would like to use the car.

413
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,391
What's going on?

414
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,892
You were right about the Nair.

415
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,231
Oh, my God, my ass is killing this cat.

416
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,818
Please?

417
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,279
No way!

418
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,614
Let's go!

419
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,493
-lt was so nice to meet you two.
-Bye, Mrs. Leroux.

420
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,911
Bye, Mrs. Leroux.

421
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,874
What was that about?

422
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,333
l don't know.
We should have breastfed longer.

423
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,751
Oh, honey.

424
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,630
Tolstoy! Jackie! Kitty down !

425
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,007
We have a kitty down !

426
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,092
What happened?

427
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,427
lt's my fault.

428
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,180
l completely blanked on
the ancient Greek for "seatbelt."

429
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,389
So now what do we do?

430
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,934
We drive really, really carefully.

431
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,481
Okay, Spidey, I don't know if you
know about super-spy missions,

432
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,817
but the key here
is the element of surprise.

433
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,779
We must be very, very, very stealthy.

434
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,285
There's Lara's place right up there.

435
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,788
We had a lot of good times
in that apartment.

436
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,832
l mean, not like that.

437
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,752
Well, like that, just not because of that.

438
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,465
Special. You know what l mean?

439
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,134
Do you?

440
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,136
Okay.

441
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,139
All right, well, you know,
she didn't think so, because

442
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:02,477
she started sharing intimacies
with this mixed martial arts guy.

443
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,396
Big, scary guy called Jörgen.

444
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,815
You know,
the two rock dots over the "o"?

445
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,570
He has this huge tattoo on his arm
of this dragon smoking a cigarette,

446
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,782
which l personally find redundant
because l don't see why a dragon

447
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,283
would smoke a cigarette.

448
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,036
lt doesn't make any sense.
You know what l'm saying?

449
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,538
Dragons have smoke in their body.

450
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,332
lt's part of being a dragon.

451
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,001
Not to mention if he's got dragon kids.

452
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,212
Smoking around dragon kids?
l don't know.

453
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,674
Time for vengeance, Spidey. Yeah !

454
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,094
Okay, man, get pumped, here we go!
Let's do this.

455
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,099
Aw, what?

456
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,647
l'm gonna have to get a little bit closer.

457
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,065
You might wanna put your mask on

458
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,026
because we're about to commit
a very serious crime.

459
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,196
l mean, you're a minor,
still, but, you know,

460
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,365
these days, they execute minors.

461
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,285
Okay. All right. Here we go.

462
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,293
Let's play.

463
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,880
Oh, yeah !

464
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,300
Direct hit, Spidey!

465
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,426
Yeah !

466
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,969
All right.

467
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,472
Oh, no, that's a fire.

468
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,516
There's a fire. lt's all on fire.

469
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,144
Get the hose! Spidey, get the hose!

470
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,236
Oh, no!

471
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,487
Oh, no.

472
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,197
What have l done?

473
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,412
Fuzzy?

474
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,997
Lara?

475
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,832
What the hell?

476
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,500
Who the hell are you?

477
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,085
Lara!

478
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,885
Oh ! Kill him, baby! Kill him !

479
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,929
Oh, this went horribly wrong.

480
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,516
Whoa. Right there.

481
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,435
-This is a nightmare!
-Come here!

482
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,604
Run, Spidey! Go! Save yourself!

483
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,690
Meet me at the car!

484
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,114
Get him !

485
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,407
You're dead.

486
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,034
What? Come on ! No!

487
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,916
What is going on?

488
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,889
Wait. Wait, Spidey! Spidey!

489
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,059
Spidey!

490
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,897
He really loves that candy.

491
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,485
-Fuzzy?
-Lara!

492
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,405
Oh, thank God. Please,
you gotta help me get my car back.

493
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,074
Why should l give a crap what happens
to your lame car?

494
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,911
Because there's
an eight-year-old boy inside.

495
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,082
That's messed up.

496
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,209
lt's not what you're thinking.

497
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,990
We checked the mini-mart
and the arcade.

498
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,533
The comic book store is closed.

499
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,162
l know. Let's go to Captain Chicken.
Albert lives for that stuff.

500
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,497
Really? Despite all the trans fat?

501
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,334
l know a place where we can ask
200 people if they've seen him.

502
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,587
No, April, for the hundredth time,

503
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,881
we are not going to Aaron Riley's.

504
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,382
You know, to be honest,

505
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,551
l don't really get all
the hype about Aaron.

506
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,763
Well, A, he's gorgeous,
and B, please refer to A.

507
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,766
Pump it up, bro!
Let's get some tunes going !

508
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,686
Hey, stop.
Only the pilot touches the controls.

509
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,896
This is the most fun l've ever had.

510
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,772
Chicks dig music, bro.

511
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,857
Stop messing !

512
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,572
Oh, fantastic! You broke the stereo!

513
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,200
No big deal. Just put the knob back on !

514
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,410
Yeah. Seriously,
Peng, just give me the knob!

515
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,370
l don't have the knob, Roosevelt!

516
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,455
l think it's over here!

517
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,249
Find the knob! Do not touch my leg !

518
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,418
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

519
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,587
You said Captain Chicken.

520
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,881
Yeah, from a side street. Not the strip!

521
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,965
l want out!

522
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,594
Oh, my God !
This is where cool people hang out.

523
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,429
We are officially losers!

524
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,931
l want out!

525
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,433
Let me out of this nerd ship!

526
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,352
Rule 6C, child safety locks. . .

527
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,020
Get us out of here, Roosevelt!

528
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,438
Where do you want me to go?

529
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,106
Oh, God !

530
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,568
Oh, no!
Here comes the uplifting chorus!

531
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,260
Okay, we're almost there.
Hang on, guys.

532
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,221
What's happening?

533
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,848
What?

534
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,267
lt's ancient Greek for broken alternator.

535
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,393
They tried telling me.

536
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,312
Move the babe magnet, asswad !

537
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,815
Yeah, asswad !

538
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,068
What's up, bitches?

539
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,528
Why don't you get out
of that honky-ass truck

540
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,988
and come at me like a man?

541
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,412
Start the car, Roosevelt.
Start it! Start the car!

542
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,831
l'm trying. Why must you
always be so confrontational?

543
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,791
Sorry, man.
You know how jacked up l get

544
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,209
the night before a debate.

545
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,003
Oh, my God. lt's my mom.

546
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,007
Holy crap, that's Mike Puglio.
He's the wedgie king.

547
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,300
Don't answer it!

548
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,260
She's gonna think that something's up.

549
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,636
Something is up.

550
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,388
Hulk like kitty.

551
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,057
-Hey.
-Here, kitty, kitty.

552
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,225
Hey, Mom.

553
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,103
-Hi, hon. How's it going?
-lt's going. lt's going great.

554
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,814
Exactly as you would
want it to go, so that's good.

555
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,900
Hey! Nice wig, Grandma!

556
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,737
What was that?

557
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,280
That was AIbert's horror fiIm.

558
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,865
Doctor's orders.

559
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,533
Oh, yeah.

560
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,493
Hey, Joy. Guess what?

561
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,703
No.

562
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,496
Classic Brueder!

563
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,833
-Step out of the banana wagon !
-Sorry, Mom !

564
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,084
Hands full with putting Albert to bed.

565
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,378
But it's all under control, though,
so you stay out!

566
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,089
Stay out and have fun !
Stay out very late, okay?

567
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,633
What is going on over there?

568
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,969
That's a very, very good pantomime.

569
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,346
Wren, can you hear me?

570
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,555
Do you do theater?

571
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,140
All right, love you. Bye.

572
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,892
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Hulk smash !

573
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,062
-Punch it! Go!
-Go!

574
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,607
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

575
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,903
That guy is getting a serious wedgie!

576
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,786
Evasive maneuvers! Hard right!

577
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,537
Hard right!

578
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:28,964
Dude, where'd they go?

579
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,677
Roosevelt, roll down the window.

580
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,846
WeIcome to Captain Chicken.

581
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,599
What be your ahr-derrr?

582
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,520
Have any fat, one-armed
Spider-Men been through here?

583
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,869
Hey, there, little guy.
Where's your family?

584
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,913
Hey! We're gonna be late.

585
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,915
Cover charge goes up in 1 5 minutes.

586
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,125
Okay.

587
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,877
Look, l got to go,
but l'm not leaving you here by yourself.

588
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:07,962
You got lD?

589
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,548
l'm just kidding. Come on.

590
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,553
l'm Galaxy Scout. You must be Spidey.

591
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,513
Do you like to dance?

592
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,228
Oh, my God. What are we listening to?

593
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,647
That's my moms' favorite musical.

594
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,067
Dad? Unlock me.

595
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,905
April, l need your help.
You are my best friend !

596
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,699
Which is why it's my duty

597
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,118
to tell you you are one more
nerd music jam away

598
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,495
from total social suicide!

599
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,663
Bye.

600
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,165
What? Peng !

601
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,416
Stop her! Grab her legs!

602
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,501
l got her! l got her!

603
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,044
Get off of me!

604
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,796
Not tonight. Nothing tonight.

605
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,383
Okay, let me go and l'll let you
touch my boob for 1 0 seconds.

606
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,093
-Thirty!
-Fifteen.

607
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,179
Twenty and l can pick a cold day.

608
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,139
-Done.
-Ha!

609
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,099
April, come on, get back in, seriously.

610
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,768
Watch out!

611
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,937
Gotcha, perds!

612
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,857
Thought you ditched us,
didn't you, fartbreath?

613
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,358
They look so mad.

614
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,867
lnside voices, inside voices!

615
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,120
Jump the curb.

616
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,289
l have this.

617
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,800
l did not have it.

618
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,987
Roosevelt, l'm so sorry.

619
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,491
l'll tell your moms it was all my fault.

620
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,409
l made you do it!

621
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,288
No, you didn't make me do anything.
l wanted to.

622
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,790
Oh, really?

623
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,625
You wanted to spend your Halloween

624
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,586
driving all over town
in a rolling "Kick Me" sign?

625
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:16,423
You wanted to get violated
by a giant pirate bird?

626
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,927
You losers have ruined our social lives!

627
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,395
Peng !

628
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,152
-Let's go back to the car.
-l can't breathe.

629
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,904
What the. . .

630
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,741
Wait. Peng.

631
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,870
He's packing heat!

632
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,371
What's he doing?

633
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,123
Hang on there, little buddy, all right.

634
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,458
You got to give me a fighting chance.

635
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,628
Let's settle this like gentlemen.

636
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,297
We're not even really gentlemen.

637
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,756
We're barely even men.

638
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,258
Hey, Peng, let's just go.

639
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,515
Count us off.

640
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,061
One! Two! Three!

641
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,898
lgnore him, Peng ! Just walk away!

642
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,234
Yeah. Losers talk, winners walk, buddy.
Let's go!

643
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,652
Ten !

644
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,122
We have a situation here
involving a musket and a drumstick.

645
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,836
That gun doesn't even work, Peng.

646
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,671
He is gonna beat the crap out of you !

647
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,508
You're right, man.

648
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,477
Mike!

649
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,653
Dude, dude, dude. Dude.

650
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,199
Dude, it's chicken. Chill out, dude.
lt's just chicken.

651
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,409
lt's just chicken, man.

652
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,499
Dude, cops. Let's split.

653
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,836
For the record,
those were not real tears!

654
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,674
Oh, and Captain Chicken,
your food sucks!

655
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,259
Come on, Peng.
We still need to find Albert

656
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,345
and l can't do it without you.
We're a team, okay?

657
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,347
All four of us.

658
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,519
April?

659
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,271
l thought all l wanted
was a night like this,

660
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,734
but we don't belong out here.

661
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,033
What if we do?

662
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,952
Come on, Peng, let's go.

663
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,537
Come on, Peng !

664
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,871
Peng !

665
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,623
Hey. Hey!

666
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,716
Stop the car, Chicken Boy!
Stop! Police! Hey!

667
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,805
-My God ! Go, go, go!
-l'm going !

668
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,724
Come on. Come on.

669
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,059
We got T. P.'ed?

670
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,894
What the hell?

671
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,147
-Stacy Lautner's dad?
-Yeah.

672
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,314
She broke my heart.

673
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,899
Vengeance!

674
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,652
Halloween.

675
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,505
Hit the road, Webster.

676
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,424
l'm gonna show you how
big people get their freak on.

677
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,384
But leave the stash !

678
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,512
l've been rippin' and tearin'
since sundown

679
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,806
and l'm feeling a little snacky!

680
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,891
Twerk it, twerk it!

681
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,976
You're a pig, Jörgen.

682
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,231
Big guy called Jörgen.

683
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:46,652
He has this big tattoo on his arm
of a dragon smoking a cigarette.

684
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,570
You even smell creepy.

685
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,656
Come on, let's go.

686
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,328
Cruddy.

687
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,413
Over-the-counter crap.

688
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,885
ls there a bathroom?
Do you have a bathroom?

689
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,847
Excuse me. Sorry.

690
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,559
Yo! ReaI Housewives of CIeveIand!

691
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,105
No. l would never be on that show.

692
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,023
Excuse me.

693
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,363
Oh, my God.

694
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,580
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.

695
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,374
l'm sorry, l'm sorry,
l didn't mean to come in. . .

696
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,877
How good is that book?

697
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,426
Can we. . .
Can we help you with something?

698
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,888
Oh, l was just looking
for a minute by myself

699
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,850
without a party animal
farting in my phone.

700
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,060
Classic Brueder.

701
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,314
No offense.
l mean, your son seems great.

702
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,066
He's an idiot.

703
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,902
Hey, guys, what's up?

704
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,988
Oh, hey, you met. l love this.

705
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,742
Quick question.
That rug in the entryway?

706
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,368
How flammable is it?

707
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,330
ls it like fire-retardant
or just regular retardant, or. . .

708
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,040
Don't even worry about it.

709
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,334
Bee-tee-dubs,
Eddie Oshinki's about to shoot

710
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,379
a ping pong ball out of his whatoosie,
and Keevin really wants you to be there.

711
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,632
lt's early in the relationship,
he's still trying to impress her.

712
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,967
Young love, right?

713
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,641
Tea? Anyone?

714
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,769
l would love tea. Thank you.

715
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,320
l'm gonna have to flee to Mexico.

716
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,949
You? l lost my little brother
on Halloween.

717
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,992
They're gonna lock me up for life!

718
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,577
l shot a man !

719
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,162
Actually, you shot a man's chicken.

720
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,624
lt's not the same.

721
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,754
What do you want?

722
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,589
-He's here!
-Where?

723
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,635
At the party.
l just saw him a second ago. Hurry.

724
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,514
April found Albert!
They're at Aaron Riley's!

725
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,598
Let's go!

726
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,065
Fuzzy. Bus stop. That way.

727
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,901
So we went to the tow yard
and my car was there.

728
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,279
Spidey wasn't. Where could he be?

729
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,738
Mind telling me
why you were hanging out

730
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,573
with an eight-year-old in the first place?

731
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,992
l was lonely.

732
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,203
Ever since you left,
l've been roommates with my sadness.

733
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,831
Hey, girl, where were you?

734
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,749
Don't ask. l spent my night with Fuzz

735
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,252
trying to find some
one-armed spider-midget.

736
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,754
Oh, my God. We know that dude.
We were partying with him.

737
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,464
-You were?
-Yeah, he's awesome.

738
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,549
See, Lara?

739
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,343
lt's not like l hang out with
lame eight-year-olds. God !

740
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,553
Where is he now?

741
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,096
l don't know. We lost him.

742
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,389
He was hitting the Rolos pretty hard.

743
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:03,724
Yeah, that's him.

744
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,518
Hey, ladies, need a ride?

745
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,063
Looking good, Lara.

746
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,565
Thank you.

747
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,692
Hey, you take that back right now.

748
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,070
Hey, Lara, is that the guy
who squats when he pees?

749
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,656
-Why would you say that to anybody?
-You do.

750
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:21,658
l can't believe. . .

751
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,083
Spidey's stash can.

752
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,713
Spidey.

753
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,596
What kind of crazy shit
are you mixed up in?

754
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,267
l think this is it right here. Make a right.

755
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Hey.

756
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,206
l heard a rumor you shot
Mike Puglio with a musket.

757
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,457
ls that true?

758
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,625
Yeah.

759
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,043
My man.

760
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,253
Come on, l want to hear all about it.

761
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,797
Hey, everyone.
This is the guy who shot Puglio.

762
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,881
Oh, my God, at last.

763
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,634
l just saw him in the living room.
Come on.

764
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:26,306
Good idea. We'll split up,
cover more ground that way.

765
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,980
So?

766
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,818
Are you blind?
On the stage. Over there.

767
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,987
Check, one, two. Check, check.

768
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,659
l can't believe l actually
thought you found my brother.

769
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,704
Really? Because l totally tried
to make it sound like that on purpose.

770
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,551
You look so familiar.

771
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,346
Were you standing behind me in line
for a mammogram last week?

772
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,598
l think l was, actually.

773
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,851
l did get a mammogram last week, so. . .

774
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,854
Does everything come out okay?

775
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:18,608
Oh, yes. Yes, they're. . .
Thank you. How are yours?

776
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,235
Oh, me, too. l'm good.

777
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,987
Oh, good, good, good.

778
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,032
How'd you meet Keevin?

779
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,827
Oh, l met him
at the Starbucks on Shattuck.

780
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,328
We go there.

781
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:34,040
My son loves Caramel Macchiatos
and that's Keevin's specialty.

782
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,209
-Oh, you have a son?
-Yep.

783
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,878
l have a son and a daughter.

784
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,006
Two children. And yet you date Keevin?

785
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,424
Larry.

786
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,135
No, we. . . l mean, we're not all. . .

787
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,303
Where's your husband?

788
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,804
Oh, for Christ's sake.

789
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:51,224
Lawrence Reuben Brueder.
l am sorry. He's so nosey.

790
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,144
He's been watching a lot
of Dr. Drew lately.

791
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,980
lt's okay. He's dead, actually. He died.

792
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,857
He passed away, and so. . .

793
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,400
You miss him?

794
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,113
Yeah, l miss my husband.
l miss him a lot.

795
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,325
You know, he was. . .
He was my husband

796
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,578
and so l'm kind of alone.

797
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,913
l have the kids there,

798
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,541
but that's not really comforting
because l'm their mother

799
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,502
and l kind of have to take care
of them all the time.

800
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,796
And my son doesn't really
talk a lot to people.

801
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:26,635
And then my daughter is talking about
going to school in New York City

802
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,386
and she wants to run
across the country,

803
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,096
which is really terrifying to me

804
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,599
because then
she's not gonna be near me

805
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,851
and l don't know how quickly
this all happened

806
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,230
because it feels like she was just a baby
a couple of months ago.

807
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,940
You know, these are things
that happen to people,

808
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,399
and a lot of people
don't even understand

809
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,817
what it's like to be a single mother.

810
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,653
A lot of people don't even get it.

811
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,863
And l'm a single mother. You know?

812
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,324
l'm a single mother, and l'm sitting here

813
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:54,538
in a Britney Spears costume
at a party with a son of yours

814
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,831
that lives with you.

815
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,960
So, yeah, l miss my husband.
l miss him.

816
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,260
What is that tea? lt's so good.

817
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,680
l suppose you want
to get back to the kids.

818
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,433
l do, actually.

819
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,822
Come on, Albert, pick up. Pick up.

820
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:55,056
Time to get elbow deep
in a little Pepto-Bismol.

821
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:57,851
Yeah.

822
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,451
Hey, whoa, hey!

823
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,828
lt's Fuzzy. What's up, man?

824
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,663
l can't believe l found you.
What up, dawg?

825
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,540
Bam. Okay, good.

826
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,916
Follow-up question.

827
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,919
What are you doing in the back
of Jörgen's car?

828
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,755
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

829
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,840
Are you out of your mind?

830
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,134
l like it. lt shows gumption.

831
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,887
You got a lot of moxie, kid,
l'll give you that. Bam.

832
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:37,641
Stash can. Thought you might
like to see that one. Good.

833
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,520
This Jörgen character has taken
a dump on both of us.

834
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,523
But tonight,

835
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,026
tonight, we dump on him.

836
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,612
Guess what's in here?
lt's not French fries.

837
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,199
That's dog poo, professional grade.

838
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,620
Come on, look, it's short notice, okay?

839
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,372
Everyone has really tiny dogs
these days.

840
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,500
l had to go
to multiple houses just to get this.

841
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,835
l mean, it doesn't even smell.

842
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,587
l don't know what
those people are feeding their dogs.

843
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,592
What do you got in there?
Fireworks! Very nice.

844
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,928
Yeah.

845
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,226
Who's there?

846
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,105
Oh, yeah.

847
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:26,731
Oh, yeah, Spidey, come on, let's go.

848
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,946
Spidey, come on.
Come on, Spidey. Spidey?

849
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:41,454
Hot foot!
You think l was born yesterday?

850
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,833
You're gonna have to come
at old Jörgen with something

851
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,626
a little more than a burning bag of. . .

852
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:53,466
You !

853
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,302
Oh, jeez! You, come here!

854
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,221
Come here! You !

855
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,932
You little twerp, come here! Come here!

856
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:05,228
Come here! Stop kicking me! Jeez!

857
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,816
Come on, Fuzzy. Spidey needs you.

858
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,484
Why can't l move?

859
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,361
Stop biting ! Stop biting !

860
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,585
Hey.

861
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,172
So. . .

862
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,175
l was planning to wait
till first snowfall, but,

863
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,179
l think l'd like to collect
on our deal right now.

864
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,518
Go for it.

865
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,277
-Seriously?
-Twenty seconds, no honking.

866
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,123
You know, l think
l'm gonna come in lefty.

867
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,541
Oh, my God.

868
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,803
You're an angel.

869
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,472
You're a glorious angel.

870
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:26,976
How long was that?

871
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,146
That was. . .

872
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:35,860
Enough.

873
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,582
Sir, l know l called before,

874
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,043
but could you please
check lock-up one more time?

875
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,754
There's a very real chance
that he's been arrested.

876
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,339
Hello?

877
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,762
Hey.

878
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,181
Hi.

879
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,933
How's it going?

880
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,813
This morning, all l wanted was
to get away from my little brother, and. . .

881
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,066
Now that l've lost him,
l'd do anything to get him back.

882
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,026
You will.

883
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,028
Are you sure?

884
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,615
l mean, as E.O. Wilson says,

885
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,660
"You are capable
of more than you know."

886
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,538
Of course, he was talking about ants

887
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,373
being able to carry 1 0 times
their body weight.

888
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,835
So l'm not really sure
if it's applicable to this situation.

889
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,882
Thank you for helping me tonight.

890
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,051
l hope l didn't ruin your Halloween.

891
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:46,139
What? No.
l never miss an opportunity to hang out

892
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,182
with a fellow fan of the Supreme Court.

893
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,397
Listen, l know this year's
probably sucked for you.

894
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,317
l just wanted to say,

895
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,903
the way that you've
handled everything has been

896
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,321
really impressive.

897
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,406
Thank you.

898
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,493
You know, as much as l admire
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

899
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:11,664
l think you're just as smart and strong

900
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,000
and awesome as she is.

901
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,502
Not quite as sexy, but,

902
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:20,048
you know, you're young. You'll get there.

903
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,841
Seriously,

904
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:25,345
Wren, l. . . l just wanted to say. . .

905
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,846
There you are!

906
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,267
Wren. . .

907
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,104
l'm really sorry about everything.

908
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,690
l'm sorry about losing Albert.

909
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,027
l'm sorry about leaving you
at Captain Chicken.

910
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,864
Be warned, it's about
to get really girly up in here.

911
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,032
Okay.

912
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:50,036
We haven't had a super fun night
in a long time, and. . .

913
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,539
l don't know. l just wanted it to be epic.

914
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:58,544
And maybe l got a little carried away.

915
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,549
You're my best friend, boo. l love you.

916
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:09,305
l love you, too.

917
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,059
Meow!

918
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,064
What were you two doing out here?

919
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,650
Nothing.

920
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:21,818
We were just. . .

921
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:22,902
-Talking.
-Don't care.

922
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,238
And now the best part is

923
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:28,157
Aaron Riley is totally
gearing up right now

924
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,118
to sing a song about you.

925
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,745
-Really?
-Yes, really.

926
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:36,165
Come on, lady.
You're not in Kansas anymore.

927
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:42,422
This song goes out to a special lady.
Wren Desantis.

928
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,217
And, please, people,
no recording devices.

929
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,970
l can't afford to have bootlegs out there.

930
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,767
Something about
the way your hair

931
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,602
Falls across your face

932
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,105
Your ears I want to nibbIe

933
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,065
Your lips l want to taste

934
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,193
l only see you in homeroom

935
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:08,281
But l think of you all day

936
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,035
Oh

937
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,040
Homeroom lady

938
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,543
I wonder what RooseveIt
was about to say?

939
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,589
He's so nice and funny and smart.

940
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,804
Wait a minute.

941
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,723
lt's Aaron Riley!

942
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,267
Focus.

943
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,229
How couId someone be so hot?

944
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:41,981
Do you love me?

945
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,485
Do you not?

946
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,659
Do you?

947
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,248
Part of me really wanted to believe
that if l kissed Aaron Riley,

948
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,833
l'd be somebody else.

949
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,004
Not just for a night, but forever.

950
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,508
And my family would be back to normal,

951
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,259
and everything would be perfect.

952
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,183
l'm sorry.

953
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,309
What's your problem,

954
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,853
-Dora the Explorer?
-Excuse me, sorry.

955
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,731
But then l realized,
perfect is an illusion.

956
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,650
Just Iike Oz is for Dorothy.

957
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,861
l. . .

958
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,948
l really appreciate you
writing that song for me.

959
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,699
But

960
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,620
l have to go.

961
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:39,789
So,

962
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,708
goodbye,

963
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,962
Aaron Riley.

964
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,564
l feel like my heart just broke.

965
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,651
Who else wants to kiss me?

966
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,944
-l do!
-Me!

967
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,070
l do!

968
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,490
Roosevelt!

969
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,826
Roosevelt! Wait!

970
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,411
Wait!

971
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,170
Who the heII is this?

972
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,921
What? You called me. Who is this?

973
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,632
This is Jörgen. l got Spidey.

974
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,552
Oh, my God! AIbert?

975
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,013
You are such a lifesaver.
Where are you?

976
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,098
Wait, it doesn't matter.
I don't have a car.

977
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,850
Do you think maybe
you could drop him off?

978
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,602
Maybe you don't understand.

979
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,979
See, Spidey thought it'd be a fun idea

980
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,481
to leave me a shit bomb.
You know what that is?

981
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,025
lt's shit with a bomb in it!

982
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,860
Now, l got a match next week!
Do you hear me?

983
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,195
What do you want?

984
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,279
Cash.

985
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,032
The fight paid $200 if I Iost,
$400 if l won.

986
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,201
Let's say l would have won.

987
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,661
l don't have that kind of money.

988
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,038
l only get $20 a week.

989
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,122
Hey, l don't care.

990
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,875
26 Grove Street.

991
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,516
You got the cash?

992
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,186
Where is he?

993
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:31,771
Albert, are you okay?

994
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,022
Albert!

995
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,190
Whoa.

996
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,860
You know, playing pranks on
Halloween is one thing.

997
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,905
But a bomb like that, that's terrorism.

998
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,616
Tiny terrorism.

999
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,370
l'm so sorry about your foot.

1000
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,747
l'm sure that he didn't mean to hurt you.

1001
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,999
l've been training for months.

1002
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,126
Do you have any idea what a strict diet

1003
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,420
of protein shakes
and Red Bull does to a man?

1004
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,132
l have a yeast infection.

1005
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,388
l don't have the money.

1006
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,932
Well, police it is.

1007
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,894
No, please!

1008
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,313
Please.

1009
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,482
He's all l have left.

1010
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,412
Do you have Licensed To III?

1011
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,248
The Beastie Boys?
Sister, l was rocking Brass Monkey

1012
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,500
when you were still a tadpole
in your daddy's sack.

1013
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,460
Look at the liner notes.

1014
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,926
91 1 , what is your emergency?

1015
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,928
HeIIo? Can you speak?

1016
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,556
Please hold.

1017
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,808
You're putting us on hold?

1018
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,896
Right there. lt says "Peter Desantis."

1019
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,649
That's my dad.

1020
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,445
And this,

1021
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,248
this is Mike D's.

1022
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,375
You don't expect me
to believe that's Mike D's.

1023
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,252
My dad was a sound engineer
in New York.

1024
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,628
He worked on their album.

1025
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,006
Mike D left his jacket
in the studio on the last day,

1026
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,883
so my dad just kept it.

1027
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:26,177
Kind of like l did.

1028
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,888
After he died.

1029
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:33,893
Look at the stitching.

1030
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,318
Well, l appreciate the donation,

1031
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,820
but some kids just belong in prison.
Let's go.

1032
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,155
What?

1033
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,406
-Let's go!
-No! What do you mean?

1034
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,325
-l mean, let's go!
-No, you said. . . Albert!

1035
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,743
No, stop!

1036
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,412
Albert! Let go of me!

1037
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,456
Yeah !

1038
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,750
What the hell?

1039
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,599
Who wants some?

1040
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,602
Albert!

1041
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:22,608
My beans!

1042
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,486
Yeah !

1043
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:29,365
Sir? StiII hoIding,
and l really need to go to the bathroom.

1044
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:33,160
Albert!

1045
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,122
Come on. Let's go.

1046
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,087
No, Albert!

1047
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:44,755
Come here, boy!

1048
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,839
Albert!

1049
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,132
Where are you going?

1050
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:49,677
Come on, Albert, hurry!

1051
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,095
Come on, Spidey, l got you covered !

1052
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,889
Oh, hi.
Hello. l'm here to rescue you.

1053
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,645
Trick or treat, bitch !

1054
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,115
Oh, yeah !

1055
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,119
Okay.

1056
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,496
l'm. . . What are you doing?

1057
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,498
l'm saving the day.

1058
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,500
l'm sorry, who are you?

1059
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,544
Oh, sorry. My name's Fuzzy.

1060
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,546
-Oh. Oh. Yeah.
-Okay, this. . .

1061
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,047
Sorry, you have bad timing.

1062
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,300
-They're getting closer, you know.
-Yeah, yeah, sorry.

1063
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,510
Hey, Spidey.

1064
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:35,097
When you're ready to talk,
l'm around to listen.

1065
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,433
Thanks for helping
a brother out tonight.

1066
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,601
Okay.

1067
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:40,603
Bam.

1068
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,605
Slam dunk.

1069
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,942
Hey. Whoo! Over here!

1070
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:49,445
-Hey, coppers! l'm crazy!
-Oh.

1071
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,696
-lt's a naked man !
-Go!

1072
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,158
l'm naked ! Come get me, coppers!
l'm a loon !

1073
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,701
Come on. Let's go.

1074
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,871
You'll never take me alive!

1075
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,669
lt has to be the best one we've done.

1076
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,546
-Oh, for sure.
-ln this series.

1077
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,631
Well, you know why?

1078
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,715
Because our heart is in this one.

1079
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,800
Yeah. And it's evolved.

1080
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,637
lt's evolved, our understanding of it.

1081
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,139
Our understanding evolved.

1082
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:22,728
Roosevelt?

1083
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,148
-ls everything okay?
-Where have you been?

1084
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,901
l messed up, Moms. l messed up bad.

1085
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,989
No, No, l can't.

1086
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,743
l'm not gonna say it in Greek or Aramaic
or any other pre-Christian language.

1087
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,953
Okay. You know that girl, Wren?

1088
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,872
l blew it.

1089
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,458
l mean, we drove around all night
looking for her little brother.

1090
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:48,295
And, oh, the Volvo, it's dead.
lt's totaled. lt's gone.

1091
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:49,630
-What?
-What?

1092
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,090
-lt's dead.
-What did you. . .

1093
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,009
And after everything,
she goes for this guy, Aaron,

1094
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:56,512
who can't even play a proper C chord.

1095
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:59,223
Roosevelt, we are
so disappointed in you.

1096
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,100
l'm going to be sick.
l'm going to be sick.

1097
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,184
Barb?

1098
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,937
l know. l'm sorry.
l'll pay off every penny.

1099
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,147
Yeah. Yeah, you will.

1100
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:10,067
But l don't give a rat's patootie
about the Volvo.

1101
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,319
ln fact,

1102
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:17,157
the fact that you're here
in the creamy, milky flesh

1103
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,119
means the unibody
construction did its job.

1104
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,455
Did we bring you up to quit?

1105
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,374
Did we bring you up to run away

1106
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,959
with your tail between
your legs every time

1107
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,294
some hot Fonzie with a guitar
woos your girl?

1108
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:33,215
Anything in this world worth
having is worth fighting for.

1109
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,384
Yeah, well, not actual fighting,
of course.

1110
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,762
Figurative. We don't condone
violence outside of the dojo.

1111
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,432
-Come on, Barb.
-Right. Of course.

1112
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:46,603
Of course.

1113
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:50,607
lf you really care about her, honey,
you need to tell her that.

1114
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,985
You want me to call her for you?

1115
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,194
Barb.

1116
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,447
No. Thanks. That's great advice.

1117
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:59,992
Let him do his own work.
Okay? This is his thing.

1118
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,035
lt's hard ! He's getting old.

1119
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,788
She called me. Hold on.

1120
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,832
Hey, Roosevelt, it's Wren.

1121
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,293
l found Albert, but unfortunately

1122
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:11,086
my mom's going
to get home before we do.

1123
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:15,215
Which means she'II either kiII me
or l'll be grounded until l'm 93.

1124
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:19,011
Either way, l want to thank you
for everything you did tonight.

1125
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,098
And l wish things had turned
out differently, because

1126
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:26,852
you're awesome. And... Yeah, okay.

1127
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,520
Bye.

1128
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,022
-What's she saying? What'd she say?
-Listen.

1129
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,523
He will tell you
when he's ready to tell you.

1130
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,608
What did she say?

1131
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,276
No, look, just she needs me. Okay?

1132
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,111
Can l borrow the other car?

1133
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,858
My dad was always into pulling pranks.

1134
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,027
That's where Albert gets it.

1135
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:20,280
The two of them Ioved HaIIoween
because they had free rein

1136
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,407
to get into as much trouble as possible.

1137
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:26,537
Well, that, and they both loved candy.

1138
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,789
Albert was never as happy

1139
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,416
as when he was
trick-or-treating with Dad.

1140
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,919
So, it seemed onIy right

1141
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,338
that since Dad couIdn't
take him this year,

1142
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,591
the Ieast I couId do was
bring Albert to see him.

1143
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:50,894
Wren?

1144
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,402
Yes, Albert?

1145
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,571
Thanks.

1146
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,951
Honey, we're home.

1147
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,125
Mrs. Desantis? Stop right there.

1148
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,627
l cannot let you enter this house.

1149
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,212
Why? Who the hell are you?

1150
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,338
Roosevelt.

1151
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,382
Friend of Wren's?

1152
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,343
Never been mentioned, huh?

1153
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:48,428
That's okay.
l mean, 'cause before tonight,

1154
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,639
l've never really done
anything worthy of her taking notice.

1155
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,725
That's a sweet story, and one that
l'm not really that interested in hearing.

1156
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,978
l've been up all night
and l really need to get some sleep.

1157
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,396
l'm afraid l can't let you do that.

1158
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:01,066
l'm a single mother.
lt's 5:30 in the morning.

1159
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,276
And you really don't
wanna mess with me.

1160
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,737
Someone is counting on me,
and l'm not letting her down,

1161
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,280
so maybe you don't
wanna mess with me.

1162
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:09,074
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.

1163
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,914
You can inflict whatever
physical pain you want,

1164
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,166
which is considerable,

1165
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,168
as is your knowledge of pressure points.

1166
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:22,671
But l'm not going anywhere.

1167
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,007
Mrs. Desantis, tonight was
the best night of my life.

1168
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:27,676
l lied to my moms for the first time ever.

1169
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,302
l trashed our Volvo.

1170
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,471
My best friend shot
another man's drumstick.

1171
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,099
The cops are probably after us.

1172
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,517
And l'm gonna have
to get a part-time job

1173
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,602
at Captain Chicken just
to pay off the damage l caused.

1174
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,607
But l wouldn't trade a minute of it,
'cause l got to spend it with Wren.

1175
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,447
And l love her.

1176
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,450
l'm in love with your daughter.

1177
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,374
-l take it you know this kid?
-Yes.

1178
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,127
Yes. l do.

1179
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,546
Wren. ls that you?

1180
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,467
Hello, Wren. Don't worry.

1181
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,802
As you can see,
l have the situation in hand.

1182
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,637
Your mother has not entered the house.

1183
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:13,889
Put your head back down.

1184
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,390
Why does this kid not want to let me in?

1185
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,225
l'll explain later.

1186
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,895
Okay. Well, he is kind of cute.

1187
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,813
lt was nice to meet you, Roosevelt.

1188
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,107
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Desantis.

1189
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:25,609
Come on, Albert.

1190
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,029
lt was awkward, but memorable.

1191
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,412
Are you okay?

1192
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:38,997
Yeah, l'm good.

1193
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,418
But more importantly,
l mean, you found Albert.

1194
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,587
-And your mom.
-Yeah.

1195
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,924
Yeah, we sort of bumped
into her on the way home.

1196
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,050
Sorry.

1197
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,679
Don't be. l'm glad l'm here.

1198
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,557
You are?

1199
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,854
'Cause now l can do this.

1200
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:07,919
Oh, hey, Fuzz.

1201
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,172
Denise, hey.

1202
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,506
Big night last night?

1203
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,717
Oh, huge night, actually.

1204
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:17,679
l finally opened my eyes and realized
that Lara and l are not meant to be.

1205
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:22,100
At all. Which is just a big
one for me to take, 'cause. . .

1206
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:25,604
No, l meant, did you ever find
that little Spider-dude?

1207
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,064
Oh, yeah, Spidey. Yeah, totally.

1208
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,525
Saved his life. No big deal.

1209
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,485
lt happens. Kind of how l roll.

1210
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:34,738
Wait, is that the new issue?

1211
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,366
lt's sold out everywhere.

1212
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,785
Yeah, l'll tell you what.

1213
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,746
lt's on the house.

1214
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,289
-Really?
-Yeah.

1215
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,875
A fellow fan of Galaxy Scout.

1216
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,252
-Wow, thanks, Fuzz.
-No problem.

1217
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,796
See you around?

1218
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:53,965
See ya.

1219
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,634
Hey, Denise?

1220
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:58,887
What do you think about maybe

1221
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,015
you, me and Spidey
hanging out whatever?

1222
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,310
Sure. Maybe just you and me?

1223
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,648
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1224
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,983
Just the two of us.

1225
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,986
Nice. Okay.

1226
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,781
l have nothing to read now.

1227
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,519
We're sure gonna miss her.
Huh, Albert?

1228
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,820
Candy pancakes with a side
of AirHead bacon.

1229
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,489
Yeah. Most people
do leftovers on Thanksgiving.

1230
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:00,949
Our family does Halloween.

1231
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,703
Amazing ! Albert made these?

1232
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,039
My compliments to the chef.

1233
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,792
Where is the little guy?

1234
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,544
l don't know.
He was just here a second ago.

1235
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,568
Maybe you could do
an explaining rap, too.

1236
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:12,479
Oh, my God.

1237
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,856
-He did not.
-l told you so!

1238
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,108
l mean, maybe sometimes
April knows something.

1239
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,278
Everything we worked for
last night is ruined.

1240
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:23,323
Maybe you could do
an explaining rap, too.

1241
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,657
Wren?

1242
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,620
I'm E.O. WiIson
and I'm a scientist

1243
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,373
l study ants and stuff
if you get the gist

1244
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,625
I'm about as cooI
as a guy can get

1245
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,336
Think Jason Bourne
with a butterfly net

1246
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:39,130
Praying mantis
Praying mantis

1247
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,549
The turtle, the turtle

1248
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:42,717
Don't do that

1249
01:18:42,802 --> 01:18:43,843
What?

1250
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,310
AIbert!

1251
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,608
Everyone thinks l don't talk.

1252
01:18:58,692 --> 01:18:59,776
But actually,

1253
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,946
l've been pranking my mom
for the past six months.

1254
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,155
HeIIo?

1255
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,408
This is Verizon calling.

1256
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,701
Your phone has been reported faulty

1257
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,830
and needs to be tested by
our voice recognition system.

1258
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,499
Could you please repeat a few phrases?

1259
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,667
Okay.

1260
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:17,502
l like cheese.

1261
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:19,671
I Iike cheese?

1262
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,173
My poops are big and hearty.

1263
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,342
My poops... Wait, who is this?

1264
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,887
This is your great-uncle Vindaloo
from Czechoslovakia.

1265
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,055
My who?

1266
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,225
Great-uncle Vindaloo.
Vindaloo. Vindaloo!

1267
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,562
l have moved to Cleveland
and am on my way to your house

1268
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,355
so l can live in the basement.

1269
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:38,982
l think you have the wrong number.

1270
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:43,361
Joy Desantis?
l'm staring at a photo of you as a baby.

1271
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,988
Okay, this is just weird.

1272
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,865
HeIIo.

1273
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,533
HeIIo?

1274
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:50,994
Hello, dear,

1275
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,705
this is the brassiere
department at Marshalls calling.

1276
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,207
The bras you ordered are here.

1277
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,920
However, they're so small,
we can't seem to find them anywhere.

1278
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,630
You must have very tiny boobs.

1279
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,382
Albert! ls this you?
