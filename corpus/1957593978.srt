1
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:13,716
(thunder rolls)

2
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,302
(eerie music)

3
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:26,969
(rain dripping)

4
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,672
(thunder crackling)

5
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:05,327
(hammer tapping)

6
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:24,546
- Missy, I've just come from town.

7
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,656
They're selling this place.

8
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:29,090
- I'm making you a
yellow strawberry candle.

9
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,923
- [Lorne] Did you hear me?

10
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,909
They're selling this place.

11
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,620
- Don't be silly.

12
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,356
No one's gonna buy it,
it's been empty for years.

13
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,384
- This time it's different.

14
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,095
Old man Roach just died.

15
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:42,234
They'll give this place
away if they have to.

16
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:43,875
- I just mixed these two colors.

17
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:44,884
What do you think, too much red?

18
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:45,832
- Missy, hey.

19
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:46,915
Listen to me.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,302
If you don't come with me now,

21
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:52,706
they're gonna find you and
lock you up for what you did.

22
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,623
Do you understand that?

23
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,922
We've got to leave now.

24
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:01,588
I found a place where I can hide you.

25
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,088
We'll be together.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,062
- What about my candles and all my books?

27
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,712
- We'll come back for them.

28
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:14,260
- I don't know, it's all so fast.

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,926
- Do you want to fry in an electric chair?

30
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:19,426
Then help me pack.

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,615
- You'll stay with me?

32
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:24,800
- Shh.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,471
If he hears us, he'll never let you go.

34
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:29,179
Yes, I'll stay with you.

35
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,679
We'll be together.

36
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,120
(rattles)

37
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,081
- Hi baby.

38
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:10,991
Glad you came.

39
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,775
It's so hot in here, isn't it?

40
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,779
I think I should take this off.

41
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:20,775
What do you think?

42
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:21,879
- No.

43
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,712
No, don't.

44
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,825
- Come closer, Lorne.

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,541
I'm not gonna bite.

46
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,922
I thought you loved me.

47
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:36,364
Don't you love me?

48
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:37,197
- I do.

49
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,671
Not like this.

50
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,705
Not with him here.

51
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,538
- Do you like my legs?

52
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,803
- [Lorne] Missy, come with me.

53
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,283
Get away from him, now.

54
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:50,230
- Would you like to touch them?

55
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,960
- Don't you want to be normal?

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,627
Not under his spell?

57
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:58,285
(sighs)

58
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,202
Make love to me, Lorne.

59
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,551
Make love to me.

60
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:07,826
(eerie music)

61
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,292
- Snap out of it, Missy.

62
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,476
Snap out of it.

63
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,309
Shake him loose.

64
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,559
Come on, Missy.

65
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,819
(grunts)

66
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:53,395
(suspenseful music)

67
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,882
- It's not gonna be an easy sale.

68
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,015
With the murders and orgies

69
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:26,170
and everything else that's
gone on in that place.

70
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,149
- I'm thinking we ought to do something

71
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,705
about it and cut the price.

72
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,527
- Minus the disclosure, it'll kill us.

73
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:31,661
Why don't we rent it?

74
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,666
Short-term.

75
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,805
What a vacation spot.

76
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:38,180
And that way, we don't have to disclose.

77
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,605
Dottie.

78
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,133
We have a new listing.

79
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,418
I want you to run down and check it out.

80
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:46,668
Directions are on the back.

81
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:56,008
Something wrong?

82
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:56,841
- Um, no.

83
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,719
Over bridge.

84
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,004
Second crossroads to right.

85
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,848
(crow squawks)

86
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,726
(eerie music)

87
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:21,450
Hello?

88
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:26,669
Is anybody here?

89
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:34,462
Hello?

90
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,609
Is anybody here?

91
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:56,852
(frightening music)

92
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,550
(engine starts)

93
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,977
(crow squawks)

94
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,560
(bells tinkle)

95
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,821
(phone rings)

96
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,952
Hello?

97
00:11:58,952 --> 00:11:59,785
- Dottie, what's going on?

98
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,489
Your appointment just called.

99
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,322
- I'm sorry, Dave.

100
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,082
I wasn't feeling well.

101
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:05,388
- So what, you just don't show up?

102
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,888
We're running a business here.

103
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,215
- I'm sorry.

104
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:11,434
I'm really sorry.

105
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,267
- Alright, look.

106
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:13,212
The woman's a Hollywood model.

107
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,726
She wants to rent a place for a month.

108
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:16,175
I faxed her a picture
of the old plantation

109
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:17,829
and she's crazy about it.

110
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,759
I want you to show it to her at four.

111
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,926
Don't be late.

112
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,546
- Excuse me?

113
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:42,154
Do you know where Brianna Dashwood is?

114
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:44,422
- Yes, she's right over
there in the pink shirt.

115
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:47,089
(boat rumbling)

116
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:22,728
- Hey you!

117
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,909
Come back with that bike.

118
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,826
Come back with my bike.

119
00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:32,683
(groans)

120
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:33,516
- Miss.

121
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:34,984
You forgot these.

122
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:37,383
- I forgot my Menthol Wendells?

123
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,216
- Cut.

124
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,733
What happened to he alligator?

125
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,112
- Miss Dashwood?

126
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:45,254
- Oh, you must be the real estate agent.

127
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:46,209
- Hi, Dottie Brooks.

128
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,042
- Nice to see you.

129
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,626
- Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier.

130
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,197
- Oh no, it's fine.

131
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,852
- The good news is I have another house.

132
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:55,241
It's a little smaller,
but it's much cozier.

133
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,074
- Hmm.

134
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,843
What about the one your office faxed me?

135
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,322
- You know, I really don't
think that house is you.

136
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,739
I mean, it's so big and cold.

137
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:09,658
- But I'd like to see it nonetheless.

138
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:12,235
- Okay.

139
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,850
- (laughs) It's terrific, I love it.

140
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,459
It's just like Gone With the Wind.

141
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,376
I can't wait for Kelly to see this.

142
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:35,724
- [Missy Narrating] There
were people here, upstairs.

143
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,659
It's strange to hear voices.

144
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,742
Happy voices.

145
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:44,423
I'm scared but also I
feel a rush of excitement.

146
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:48,665
I've been alone for so
long except for Lorne.

147
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:50,421
I hope he sells more of my candles,

148
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,421
I'm running out of food.

149
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,277
(machinery clanks)

150
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,554
- Kelly?

151
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,364
- Oh my God. (screams)

152
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:27,441
I missed you so much.

153
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,990
- It's so good to see you.

154
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,823
- It's so good to see you.

155
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:31,886
- [Both] You look great. (laughs)

156
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:34,136
(applause)

157
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:41,104
- Let's not forget Damon's motto.

158
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,937
Without passion, there is no life.

159
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,038
- [Kelly] So who is this guy, anyway?

160
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:49,203
- [Brianna] He's the
director, Damon Letterton.

161
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:50,231
- I think he likes you.

162
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:51,430
- Well he'd like a tree if it

163
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,365
had a properly placed nut hole.

164
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,389
- He's pretty good looking
and he's a director.

165
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,222
- Yeah.

166
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,255
- [Kelly] Here he comes.

167
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,088
- Hello, hello, hello.

168
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:05,717
And you are?

169
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:06,550
- Kelly.

170
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,716
- Kelly.

171
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,699
Absolutely ravishing.

172
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,335
- Oh thank you.

173
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:14,640
- And Brianna, stunning as always.

174
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,235
- I aim to stun.

175
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:17,068
- Cute.

176
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:20,697
Do you tango?

177
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:22,442
- She's engaged.

178
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:23,807
- How intriguing.

179
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,133
In what, pray tell?

180
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,489
- To be married.

181
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:29,072
- But so young, so daisy fresh.

182
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:32,706
So totally unfair.

183
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:34,291
- Damon.

184
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,812
Eugene said that you could
hypnotize me. (laughs)

185
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,164
- I didn't say that.

186
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,696
- Yes you did.

187
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:41,696
Yes you did.

188
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,987
He said that-- (laughs)

189
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:50,571
you sure did, hypnotize me
to make my boobs get bigger.

190
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:53,316
- (laughs) I didn't say that.

191
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,813
- Yeah you did, yeah you did.

192
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,730
And you can, can't you?

193
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,712
- Can you really do that?

194
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:06,335
Can you really make her boobs bigger?

195
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,332
- Indeed I can.

196
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:09,904
I've done it before.

197
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,987
You'd be amazed at what
you can do with hypnosis.

198
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:18,965
Hello, lovelies.

199
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:19,913
Want a ride?

200
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,769
- No thanks, we're waiting on a taxi.

201
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,022
- You won't need a taxi.

202
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,241
The one and only taxi
just left for Summerton.

203
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,509
- You're bagging us, right?

204
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,083
- I do not bag.

205
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,846
Waited two hours for the
taxi myself just last week.

206
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,096
- [Eugene] Come on, hop in.

207
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,534
- Hi, how's it going?

208
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,342
- Damon, hands where we can see them.

209
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,592
- So young, so distrusting.

210
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:34,798
This is perfect, this is great.

211
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:36,911
Look at the pillars.

212
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:37,909
Do we have any film?

213
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,242
- Oh yeah, we got 2000 feet.

214
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:43,152
- Brianna, please.

215
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:44,445
Just one outside shot.

216
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:45,798
- Wait, an outside shot?

217
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:47,381
- Bless your heart.

218
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:53,956
- They said they were gonna clean this up.

219
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,317
- [Kelly] It's a little spooky, isn't it?

220
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,658
- But don't you like it?

221
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:00,491
Look.

222
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,212
- Yeah, I do.

223
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:13,180
- Wow.

224
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,220
This is great.

225
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:18,174
What an aura.

226
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,159
Real cobwebs.

227
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:24,355
This is fantastic.

228
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,963
Very filmic.

229
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,244
- Damon.

230
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,720
I'm on vacation.

231
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,706
- What's an hour's shoot?

232
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,142
Come on, it's not gonna hurt you.

233
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,729
- I've got an idea.

234
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:35,596
We'll trade you one hour of shooting

235
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:38,546
for two hours of cleaning.

236
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,751
- Where are you, spirit, where are you?

237
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:43,105
You've never left me, you've
always looked after me.

238
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:45,592
Like the time I fell down the stairs

239
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,925
when my brother worked here.

240
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:49,932
Please, where are you?

241
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:50,794
Don't leave me.

242
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:53,688
Make them go away, make them go away.

243
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:54,855
Where are you?

244
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:01,233
(eerie music)

245
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,632
(crows squawking)

246
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:25,884
- This is the one.

247
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:33,403
- Why can't we just share a bedroom?

248
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,986
(piano clangs)

249
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:20,845
(heavy breathing)

250
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:25,268
- I got ya.

251
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:26,113
(screams)

252
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:26,946
Hey.

253
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:30,504
- Fred, why did you do that?

254
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:32,233
- Hey hey, you okay?

255
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,185
You a little jumpy?

256
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:34,485
Did you see a ghost or something?

257
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:35,318
- No.

258
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,791
- Let's take a look.

259
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,541
Ooh, it's a bathroom.

260
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:45,022
You want to go in?

261
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:45,855
Come on.

262
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,962
(eerie music)

263
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:14,217
(eerie piano music)

264
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:50,349
- She didn't sign the insurance form.

265
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,182
- No, I'm sure she did.

266
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:52,015
I gave her--

267
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:54,578
- No she didn't, she signed the wrong one.

268
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,078
Look, I want you to run down
there and get it signed.

269
00:22:57,078 --> 00:23:00,245
Better hurry before that storm starts.

270
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:24,877
(thunder rumbles)

271
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:31,295
- Okay girls, don't think of
this as horny and terrified.

272
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,539
I want you to think about
this as terrifiably horny.

273
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,541
Alright?

274
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,774
Okay, cameras rolling?

275
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:36,977
Sound?

276
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:38,052
Back to one.

277
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:38,885
Action.

278
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,552
(screams)

279
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:44,385
Cut, cut.

280
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:45,218
One more time, girls.

281
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:47,048
- No Damon, wrap.

282
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:47,881
- Oh come on.

283
00:23:47,881 --> 00:23:49,020
Just a martini shot.

284
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,914
- You've been saying that all day.

285
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:52,021
No.

286
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:53,972
- Come on, we got it.

287
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:54,972
- Hi Dottie.

288
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:58,676
- [Dottie] I didn't realize
you'd be filming here.

289
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,140
- Neither did we.

290
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,025
I'm sorry.

291
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:01,905
We're finished.

292
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:03,212
I hope it's not a problem.

293
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:04,356
- No actually I had to come by

294
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,580
because you signed the
wrong insurance papers.

295
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,413
- I'm sorry.

296
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,746
- No, it's my fault.

297
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,160
Look, if you could sign right here.

298
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,334
- Shit, the forklift.

299
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:14,345
Come on, come on.

300
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,345
- Apple boxes, let's go.

301
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:24,488
- Look, I don't have the number.

302
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:27,988
There's no phone here 'til tomorrow.

303
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,988
It's someone's portable.

304
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:32,328
- I'm sure it'll let up.

305
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:34,289
Want to come have a cup of coffee?

306
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:37,189
- No, as soon as it eases up
I'm gonna make a run for it.

307
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:41,042
- Let's go, come on, come on, come on.

308
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,249
(screaming)

309
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:43,166
Oh man, oh!

310
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:02,003
(eerie music)

311
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,620
(car thuds)

312
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:02,078
(screams)

313
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:15,485
(thunder rumbles)

314
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:50,410
- Help me!

315
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:54,085
Help, somebody help!

316
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,242
Help, my car's stuck--

317
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,403
- Hey hey hey, it's okay.

318
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,486
Take it easy.

319
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:05,289
Get inside, get inside.

320
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:06,122
Inside.

321
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:08,330
Come on.

322
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,577
- How about I make a fire?

323
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:20,797
- Good idea.

324
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:22,454
You are absolutely soaked to the bone.

325
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:23,454
Look at you.

326
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:26,169
Thanks, Kel.

327
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,416
- I'll go get some hot chocolate.

328
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,380
- We really need to get you
out of these wet things.

329
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,867
- I can't.

330
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,818
I can't stay here.

331
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,377
I have to get home.

332
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:38,107
- It's absolutely storming out there.

333
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:40,440
It's really not a good idea.

334
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:48,363
It's practically a hurricane.

335
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,190
- Why don't you take a hot shower?

336
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,256
You'll feel a lot better.

337
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,949
- No, I'll be fine.

338
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:14,866
They'll get my car out and I'll go.

339
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:23,211
- Make sure the hand brake's off.

340
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,679
- It's bloody locked.

341
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,527
- God, look at this maneuver.

342
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,444
Glad she's not my wife.

343
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:31,715
- What are you doing?

344
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:32,976
Help me push.

345
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:34,561
- I'll drive, you push.

346
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:37,523
- No, no, you'll sink it more.

347
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,817
God, you fucking--

348
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:41,670
Dipshit's fucking useless.

349
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,423
Come on, let's leave it.

350
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:48,322
Come on, she can get a
tow truck in the morning.

351
00:28:48,322 --> 00:28:49,989
Forget it, let's go.

352
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,470
Whoo!

353
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,543
God.

354
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:06,626
- Thanks, Eugene.

355
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:07,838
- Yeah, no problem.

356
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:08,671
- Did you get her car out?

357
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,450
- No, no we didn't.

358
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,936
There's a river out there
and there's just no way.

359
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:16,730
Looks like you're spending the night.

360
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,897
- No, I can't.

361
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:25,188
I mean, there's got to be
another way out of here.

362
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:31,747
- Are you kidding?

363
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:32,914
That's insane.

364
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,057
What if my wife were having a baby?

365
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:39,075
Tough luck?

366
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:40,835
Thanks.

367
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,599
Yeah no, thanks a lot.

368
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:47,085
- What did he say?

369
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:48,960
- Nobody's moving.

370
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,311
- For how long?

371
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:52,408
- 'Til the rain stops.

372
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:55,431
Looks like we're just stuck here

373
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:57,454
for a couple of days, that's all.

374
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:59,785
- I can't stay here.

375
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:00,649
- Well I'm afraid you don't really have

376
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,941
much choice my dear, do you?

377
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:04,807
Look at the bright side.

378
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:08,782
All you girls get to spend
some quality time with me.

379
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,199
- Bite me, Damon.

380
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:14,135
- There's an Americanism I can endorse.

381
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:17,885
- You'll feel better
after you take a shower.

382
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,833
Let me know if you need anything.

383
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:32,748
- It's okay.

384
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,104
(wind howls)

385
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,083
(thunder rumbles)

386
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:12,546
(thunder cracks)

387
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,356
- 700 dollars.

388
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,416
Quite a steal for this place.

389
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:47,583
- The broker says it's best to
show buyers a lived-in house.

390
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:49,297
- I see.

391
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:52,489
Must be 200 years old.

392
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,849
If only these walls could talk.

393
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:04,554
- What do you think they'd say?

394
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:07,698
- I am your slave, Master.

395
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:12,229
Do with me as thouest please, probably.

396
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:36,597
In keeping with the general motif?

397
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,333
- In keeping with what?

398
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,269
- The magazine, is it keeping
with the motif of the house?

399
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,134
- It's motif.

400
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:49,207
- You mean you haven't noticed?

401
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,624
- Nude paintings?

402
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,427
- Lust.

403
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,012
Passion.

404
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,891
Sex.

405
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:04,891
You looked great in your underwear today.

406
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:08,089
You really are quite gorgeous.

407
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,089
- Thank you.

408
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:11,626
- It's a pleasure.

409
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,041
- Who is it?

410
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,291
- It's Brianna.

411
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:20,351
- Hey.

412
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:21,840
- I brought you a robe.

413
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,097
- I really feel terrible about
imposing on you like this.

414
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,412
- Oh, but you're not.

415
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:26,245
It's fine.

416
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,973
- Some way to start your vacation.

417
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,801
- (laughs) Well actually,
it's kind of exciting.

418
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:36,165
As long as the roof doesn't start leaking.

419
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:38,430
Anyway, you are welcome
to use our portable

420
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,687
downstairs anytime you
need to call anyone.

421
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,650
- My husband won't even realize I'm gone.

422
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,599
- I thought it was
urgent that you get home.

423
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,721
- I just had to go by the office.

424
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:52,804
It doesn't really matter.

425
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,477
- Well let me leave you this.

426
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,411
- Thank you.

427
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:20,320
(lightning crackles)

428
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,211
- Is she okay?

429
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,568
Okay Bri, fine.

430
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:44,401
Blame me.

431
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:46,236
I'm the one that made it rain
so hard it trapped us here.

432
00:34:46,236 --> 00:34:47,772
- No, Kel.

433
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:50,772
I wasn't thinking about that at all.

434
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:54,026
She is so strange.

435
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,036
- Who, the broker?

436
00:34:58,036 --> 00:34:59,182
- Yeah.

437
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:02,239
- [Kelly] Why, what'd she do?

438
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:04,822
- It's the way she looks at me.

439
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,068
- Looks at you.

440
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:09,068
You mean, like that way?

441
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,693
- Yeah.

442
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,381
Oh my God.

443
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,881
(eerie music)

444
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,169
- You came back.

445
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:34,372
- Are you okay, Missy?

446
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:35,924
- There are people upstairs, Lorne.

447
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:37,558
What are they doing up there?

448
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:38,444
- I know.

449
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:43,103
I'll get you out just as soon
as the rain stops, alright?

450
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:46,041
- He never leaves me like this.

451
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:46,882
I don't understand.

452
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:49,465
Why is he leaving me like this?

453
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,110
- [Marla] That is such
a goddamn philosophy.

454
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,964
- No, it's not.

455
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,573
- Yes it is, yes it is.

456
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:07,406
- You're actually wrong.

457
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,604
- It is the same either way.

458
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:10,991
- What do you girls think?

459
00:36:10,991 --> 00:36:12,066
- [Kelly] About what?

460
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,700
- Well, if a man has sex with another man

461
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,662
he's a homosexual, but
is a woman a lesbian

462
00:36:16,662 --> 00:36:18,419
if she has sex with another woman?

463
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:19,722
- I think two people should be able to do

464
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,515
whatever they want to do.

465
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,623
- Hmm, how very modern of you.

466
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:26,329
Is that to say that if your Bob man

467
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,854
liked to visit the farms in Nebraska,

468
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,265
penis-probe the cows,

469
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:34,347
he'd be well within his
rights according to Kelly?

470
00:36:34,347 --> 00:36:37,617
- (laughs) I said two people.

471
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:39,031
- Don't mind Damon, Kel.

472
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,605
He's been voted most likely
to date outside his species.

473
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:43,772
- And why not?

474
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,483
- Poker, anyone?

475
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:53,697
- You don't mind, Marla?

476
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,172
- Hey.

477
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,672
Loser of each hand

478
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:02,070
has to take an article of
clothing and put it in the pot.

479
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,168
- Strip poker?

480
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:04,572
No way.

481
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,850
- Gee golly willikers, is
that what you Yanks say?

482
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,742
Come on, Brianna.

483
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,034
Loosen up.

484
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:09,960
- Yeah come on, Brianna.

485
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,381
We've seen you in close to nothing anyway.

486
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,909
- Oh well, aren't you lucky.

487
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,585
- Gee, isn't this cozy.

488
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:19,585
All of us here together.

489
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:23,906
- Okay.

490
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:25,323
Word association.

491
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:29,224
Pink.

492
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,668
- Strawberry milk.

493
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:36,595
- Pink milk.

494
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:39,086
Breasts.

495
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:40,758
- Chicken.

496
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:44,337
- [Damon] Thigh.

497
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:45,721
- Wings.

498
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,671
- (laughs) She got you, Damon.

499
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:48,844
- Okay, fine.

500
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:50,844
How about truth or dare?

501
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,441
- Yeah, let's play truth or dare.

502
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,961
I haven't played that
since I was a little girl.

503
00:37:57,961 --> 00:37:59,128
- Okay, Kelly.

504
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:02,498
We'll start with you.

505
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:05,131
Truth, but you have to tell me the truth.

506
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:06,959
We'll start subtle.

507
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,876
What's your wildest sexual fantasy?

508
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:15,014
- That's not subtle.

509
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:19,589
I think I'll take the dare.

510
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,066
- Okay.

511
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,661
Kiss me on the lips.

512
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:24,260
- What else can I take?

513
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,576
- You can take the truth.

514
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:28,794
What is your wildest sexual fantasy?

515
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:30,219
- Can't somebody else--

516
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:33,549
- If you won't kiss me, kiss her.

517
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:34,549
On the lips.

518
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,567
- You're joking, right?

519
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,519
Come on, kiss her.

520
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,060
- (laughs) Okay.

521
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,246
- Boo, hiss.

522
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:02,913
Come on, do it like you mean it.

523
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,581
- Come on, Damon, she did it already.

524
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:07,414
- Alright.

525
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:11,555
How about you, Marla?

526
00:39:11,555 --> 00:39:12,579
- No.

527
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,442
- Come on, Marla.

528
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:17,319
Why don't you share your
sexual fantasy with us.

529
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,381
Get us warmed up.

530
00:39:19,381 --> 00:39:22,131
- Why don't you warm up yourself?

531
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:29,949
- [Kelly] Why don't you
tell us your fantasy, Damon?

532
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:32,008
- Mine, sweet Kelly?

533
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:33,410
The truth?

534
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,743
Well, the usual.

535
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:37,975
Long spiked heels, wax.

536
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:41,909
Leather.

537
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:43,076
Lumber, honey.

538
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:48,228
Hello.

539
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:51,003
You're awfully quiet this evening.

540
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:51,920
Wanna play?

541
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:54,038
- No thanks.

542
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:57,367
- I was wondering.

543
00:39:57,367 --> 00:40:01,048
All the rooms in this house
aren't locked, except one.

544
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:03,448
The one downstairs.

545
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:04,448
Why is that?

546
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:07,168
- How should I know?

547
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,192
- Well you are the realtor, come on.

548
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,606
Truth.

549
00:40:10,606 --> 00:40:12,523
What's in the basement?

550
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:14,970
- I don't know.

551
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,387
- I think you do.

552
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,295
- Good night.

553
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,278
- [Eugene] I think he upset her.

554
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:08,915
(sighs)

555
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,474
- Just be quiet.

556
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:23,094
Shh.

557
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,957
Maybe the girls should stay here.

558
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:27,066
- [Kelly] I'm not scared.

559
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:28,019
- [Marla] Absolutely not.

560
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:28,852
- Shh.

561
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,912
(laughter)

562
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:34,752
- [Damon] Quit pushing.

563
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:36,012
- [Kelly] I'm not.

564
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:37,762
I can't see anything.

565
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,439
- [Brianna] Why are we whispering?

566
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:43,439
- [Eugene] I don't know.

567
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:51,234
- [Damon] Whoa.

568
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:54,909
- [Brianna] Wow.

569
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,492
Look at this place.

570
00:41:57,455 --> 00:41:58,538
Unbelievable.

571
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:02,711
- It seems obvious to me that
somebody's living down here.

572
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:04,770
- Must be the candle gnomes.

573
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,327
- [Damon] Or Michael Crawford,
after his last curtain call.

574
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,541
- [Eugene] I don't get it.

575
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:13,742
- [Damon] Michael Crawford,
Phantom of the Opera.

576
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:16,302
- [Brianna] Look at the work in these.

577
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:17,263
- [Damon] At least we don't have to worry

578
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,013
about a power outage.

579
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:24,527
- Your daddy said that no one
has lived here for 12 years.

580
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,860
- Maybe there's a caretaker.

581
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,162
- Kel?

582
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:40,587
Kelly?

583
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:43,520
Kelly, are you okay?

584
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:49,420
- It's just a little
hot in here, isn't it?

585
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:06,340
(screaming)

586
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,173
- No, no.

587
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,733
Don't scream, don't scream.

588
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,566
It's me, it's me Lorne.

589
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:14,640
See, remember?

590
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,473
Lorne.

591
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:16,633
Don't you remember?

592
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:18,569
You, me, and Tiffany.

593
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:20,064
We were friends.

594
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:20,934
- Lorne.

595
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,351
- [Damon] Dottie?

596
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:29,612
- Don't tell them I'm here,
please don't tell them.

597
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,050
- You're okay?

598
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,538
- Yeah.

599
00:43:36,538 --> 00:43:39,693
- You screamed, I came running.

600
00:43:39,693 --> 00:43:42,950
- I was reading, a spider fell down.

601
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,200
I hate spiders.

602
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,290
- Nice book.

603
00:43:51,152 --> 00:43:54,152
Well, you're okay and spider-thingy.

604
00:43:58,062 --> 00:43:59,479
Sorry about that.

605
00:44:03,781 --> 00:44:05,658
She saw a spider.

606
00:44:05,658 --> 00:44:07,741
- [All] She saw a spider?

607
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,064
- I hate mice.

608
00:44:19,186 --> 00:44:22,257
- Why did you come back here, Dottie.

609
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:23,954
Dottie Brooks.

610
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:25,537
- I didn't mean to.

611
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:30,913
I mean, I didn't remember this
place at all until yesterday.

612
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:32,937
- Did you tell them?

613
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:35,812
Did you tell them about him?

614
00:44:35,812 --> 00:44:37,812
About what happens here?

615
00:44:38,786 --> 00:44:41,080
- I don't know what you mean.

616
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,913
- You saw.

617
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,891
Strapped to the rack.

618
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:49,534
- Tiffany.

619
00:44:50,543 --> 00:44:51,982
- Chad did it.

620
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:52,815
- Chad?

621
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,024
- Madman Chad.

622
00:44:56,149 --> 00:44:57,316
He killed her.

623
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,365
He killed her.

624
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:04,165
It really wasn't his fault.

625
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:08,511
He made it happen.

626
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,169
We've gotta get you out of here.

627
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:14,203
But you gotta promise, you
can't tell them anything.

628
00:45:14,203 --> 00:45:17,484
Tiffany would want me to protect you.

629
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,317
- Where are you going?

630
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:21,907
- Don't worry.

631
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:23,157
I'll be around.

632
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:49,593
- There's another stormfront
coming in after this one.

633
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:52,093
It's supposed to be a big one.

634
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:54,175
- I wonder what they used to do

635
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:56,675
before they had TV and videos.

636
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:04,086
- Well they managed to get a good old book

637
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:06,499
and a glass of brandy

638
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:08,998
and the women would sit on their laps

639
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,402
and wiggle their little fannies until

640
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:13,533
they just couldn't control
themselves any longer.

641
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:16,473
And then they'd bore their
brains out all night long.

642
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,306
Wanna try?

643
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:22,613
- Let's call it a night, Kel.

644
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,944
- In a bit.

645
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:25,577
- It seems your
fresh-scrubbed young friend

646
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:28,754
isn't as afraid of intimate
human contact as you are.

647
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:32,337
- She just wants to
finish her wine, Damon.

648
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:37,983
- I don't really have fantasies.

649
00:46:42,118 --> 00:46:44,285
- Everybody has fantasies.

650
00:46:47,297 --> 00:46:50,214
- I do have this reoccurring dream.

651
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:57,363
It's a very explicit dream.

652
00:46:58,538 --> 00:46:59,705
- A wet dream?

653
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:03,173
- What is that?

654
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:05,318
When you pee in your sleep?

655
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:08,780
- It's when you climax in your sleep.

656
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,078
- I mean, I really wouldn't
want this to happen

657
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:15,828
but in the dream it's incredible.

658
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:19,345
I'm at this party with Bob

659
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:23,400
and suddenly these bikers storm in.

660
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:28,357
And the leader, he's really gorgeous.

661
00:47:28,357 --> 00:47:32,001
He's wearing black leather gloves,

662
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:35,817
boots, chains, and he
comes in and he stands

663
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:39,984
in the middle of the room and
he looks around at everybody

664
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,191
and suddenly his eyes, they lock on me.

665
00:47:46,191 --> 00:47:50,068
I'm not scared, I look right back at him.

666
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:53,651
He's got these gorgeous
piercing blue eyes.

667
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:58,879
And he takes me by the shoulders

668
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:03,403
and pushes me down on the couch.

669
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,383
And then he just rips my
dress off with one tug

670
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,521
and then he gets out this knife

671
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:19,354
and he cuts my bra straps
and my bra falls off

672
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,270
and then he cuts my panties

673
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,593
and he pulls my panties down

674
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:34,354
and everybody's watching.

675
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,371
Everybody.

676
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,549
I'm completely naked in front of everyone.

677
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:48,126
And I don't fight him because I like it.

678
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:53,504
I mean, I like everybody looking at me.

679
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:01,445
Bob, he's there watching
and he doesn't do anything.

680
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:02,869
He's too scared.

681
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,119
He's watching, just like everyone else.

682
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,193
(laughs)

683
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:18,934
And then the biker, he puts
his face down between my legs.

684
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:31,505
And I can feel him.

685
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:34,338
I mean God, I can really feel him.

686
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,775
It gets me really hot.

687
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:48,004
I just want him to fuck me.

688
00:49:50,694 --> 00:49:53,611
I think I even tell him to fuck me.

689
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:57,385
No, I say please fuck me.

690
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:08,452
He unzips his pants.

691
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,676
And he lowers himself inside of me.

692
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:27,744
And we both have orgasms at the same time.

693
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:34,906
And that's usually when I wake up.

694
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,880
(clapping)

695
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,713
- Bravo.

696
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,253
Stellar fantasy.

697
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,197
- Come on.

698
00:50:47,197 --> 00:50:50,208
- You know, it's usually proper to offer

699
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:53,778
some sort of salutation when
leaving someone's company.

700
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:54,983
Good night, Damon.

701
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:57,483
Sleep well will suffice.

702
00:50:57,483 --> 00:50:59,264
Don't let the bedbugs bite, maybe.

703
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,605
- Do you know what you just did?

704
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:02,190
- I really had them going, didn't I?

705
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,163
- Yes.

706
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:03,996
- Think I shocked them?

707
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:07,324
- Yes, you just gave
Damon an open invitation

708
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:08,943
to do whatever he wants.

709
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:11,688
I mean, if he is what
you want, that's fine.

710
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:12,550
- Great.

711
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,800
I was just having some fun.

712
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:17,998
- Good night, sport.

713
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:23,600
See you in the morning.

714
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:43,951
(giggling)

715
00:51:45,114 --> 00:51:45,978
- Give me my hat.

716
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,660
- What are you willing to do for it?

717
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,577
- Anything.

718
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:41,417
(whimpers)

719
00:52:44,652 --> 00:52:45,652
- It's okay.

720
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:48,546
Go on.

721
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:57,422
Go ahead.

722
00:53:57,297 --> 00:53:59,297
(moans)

723
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,727
(sighing)

724
00:54:43,228 --> 00:54:44,061
- Yeah.

725
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,483
- Kelly?

726
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:29,756
- I'm gonna die if I
don't get a caffeine fix.

727
00:55:29,756 --> 00:55:31,024
- Are you okay?

728
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:32,107
- Yeah, sure.

729
00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:38,087
(whistling)

730
00:55:57,638 --> 00:56:00,055
(rock music)

731
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:03,328
- Oh my God.

732
00:56:08,046 --> 00:56:09,373
(laughs)

733
00:56:09,373 --> 00:56:10,640
- You want to eat?

734
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,473
- No thanks, I think
I'll have some breakfast.

735
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:19,118
(coughs)

736
00:56:21,695 --> 00:56:24,112
What did you do to your hair?

737
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:29,104
- I did it for you.

738
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:31,758
- Your bacon's burning.

739
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:32,591
- Oh shit.

740
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:40,240
(laughs)

741
00:56:42,853 --> 00:56:43,770
Sandwiches?

742
00:56:48,558 --> 00:56:49,391
- It doesn't look like we're

743
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:51,630
gonna get out of here today either.

744
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,054
- What's the rush?

745
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:55,310
We have food, beverage,

746
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,164
the pleasure of each other's company.

747
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:02,441
The fact is, I'm very
attracted to you, Kelly.

748
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:03,548
But I sense you may have eyes

749
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:05,259
on someone else in the house.

750
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,176
Am I right?

751
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,901
- Of course not, I'm engaged.

752
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:11,706
- Yes, you mentioned that.

753
00:57:11,706 --> 00:57:13,456
So, where is Brianna?

754
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:17,117
- Good morning.

755
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:18,517
- [Marla] Whoa.

756
00:57:18,517 --> 00:57:20,100
- Very interesting.

757
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:22,578
- Good morning.

758
00:57:22,578 --> 00:57:24,272
- You know, they say it
can fall off with overuse.

759
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:27,318
- Hey, not my tallywhacker.

760
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,591
They don't call me shoot for nothing,

761
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:29,546
isn't that right babe?

762
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,796
- That's right.

763
00:57:32,878 --> 00:57:33,711
- Morning.

764
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:36,694
- Good morning, Brianna.

765
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:41,112
- Coffee, please?

766
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:41,945
- Sure.

767
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,090
(eerie music)

768
00:58:42,955 --> 00:58:45,038
(grunts)

769
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:36,250
(screaming)

770
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,382
- [Disembodied Female
Voice] I'll do anything

771
00:59:37,382 --> 00:59:38,891
you want me to do, I promise, I promise!

772
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:41,808
I'll do anything you want me to do.

773
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,494
- This is decadent.

774
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:50,667
- What are you doing down here?

775
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,396
- What am I doing down here?

776
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:53,229
I thought a better question would be,

777
00:59:53,229 --> 00:59:54,475
what are you doing down here?

778
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:55,807
Looking for someone?

779
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:57,077
- No.

780
00:59:57,077 --> 00:59:59,160
There's nobody down here.

781
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:02,700
- Is there something you're
not telling us, Dottie?

782
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,311
Something we should know?

783
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:05,293
- No, Damon.

784
01:00:05,293 --> 01:00:06,682
Nothing.

785
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:08,349
- Nothing, you sure?

786
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,504
- No.

787
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:13,504
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

788
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,567
(rattles)

789
01:00:37,654 --> 01:00:38,487
- [Missy Narrating] I keep going back

790
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:40,511
to the night of the party.

791
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:41,511
The murders.

792
01:00:42,904 --> 01:00:44,260
I can't think of anything else.

793
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,177
My thoughts consume me.

794
01:00:47,029 --> 01:00:48,787
I should have never
smoked that damn cactus.

795
01:00:48,787 --> 01:00:49,899
How could I have killed them?

796
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:51,982
Was I really that stoned?

797
01:00:57,012 --> 01:00:58,390
Lorne just got back from town.

798
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,311
He says the police are looking for me.

799
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,895
He says he'll never let them get me.

800
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:04,895
He loves me.

801
01:01:06,138 --> 01:01:07,638
I guess I'm lucky.

802
01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:19,936
(lightning crackles)

803
01:01:19,936 --> 01:01:21,852
- What is it with you two?

804
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:26,852
Did somebody hog the covers
or something last night?

805
01:01:26,852 --> 01:01:27,685
Guess so.

806
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,460
- Here's a toughie.

807
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,545
Is Marla going to give me

808
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:35,918
a big wet, sloppy gumming tonight?

809
01:01:35,918 --> 01:01:38,001
(laughs)

810
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:51,957
- You okay?

811
01:01:51,957 --> 01:01:53,416
- Yeah, I was just looking for a soda

812
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:57,583
but it looks like I'm gonna
have to settle for some milk.

813
01:02:06,116 --> 01:02:07,471
- Kel?

814
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:09,026
We need to talk.

815
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:11,525
- What, and miss the fun?

816
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:13,125
- Yeah.

817
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:16,814
We can't let what happened last
night spoil our friendship.

818
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:17,647
- Last night?

819
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:18,850
What about last night?

820
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,518
I can hardly remember
anything, I was so drunk.

821
01:02:22,518 --> 01:02:24,421
- You know what, I do remember.

822
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:26,807
And I think we need to talk about it.

823
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:28,140
Come on in here.

824
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:42,884
I don't know why we did--

825
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:43,717
- Bri.

826
01:02:43,717 --> 01:02:44,550
- What?

827
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,383
- I'm not like that.

828
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:47,633
I mean, we could never be--

829
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:50,519
- I don't want that either.

830
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:53,964
- [Kelly] But all that talk of
you having trouble with men--

831
01:02:53,964 --> 01:02:54,911
- [Brianna] Well it's true,

832
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:56,719
but that doesn't mean I'm a lesbian.

833
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:57,869
- [Kelly] You were last night.

834
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,026
- [Brianna] Well so were you.

835
01:02:59,026 --> 01:02:59,859
- What are they saying?

836
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,030
- Shh.

837
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,780
- Yeah, it was weird.

838
01:03:03,924 --> 01:03:05,866
- It was actually kind of nice.

839
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,967
- I think once was enough for me.

840
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:10,598
Even though I did have a great orgasm.

841
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:11,848
What about you?

842
01:03:14,184 --> 01:03:17,188
- I've never even had an orgasm.

843
01:03:17,188 --> 01:03:19,408
- You've never what?

844
01:03:19,408 --> 01:03:21,402
- [Brianna] I guess I'm
what they call frigid.

845
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:22,485
I just can't.

846
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:27,048
- Brianna, maybe you need to
see a doctor or something.

847
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:28,544
- I did.

848
01:03:28,544 --> 01:03:30,377
He asked me to dinner.

849
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:33,884
- What about hypnosis?

850
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:36,688
- Yeah, I'll ask Damon to do it.

851
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,960
- That's not such a bad idea.

852
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,398
He really does do hypnosis.

853
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,315
- Oh Kelly, yeah right.

854
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:50,413
- You have a certain fondness
for the grape, don't you?

855
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:52,787
- What else is there to do trapped here?

856
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:57,109
- Well, one is limited
only by one's imagination.

857
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:59,866
- You really are a
ratbag, aren't you Damon?

858
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:00,699
- Maybe.

859
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:05,063
You have very pretty features.

860
01:04:05,063 --> 01:04:06,980
Quite striking, really.

861
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:13,384
- Will you take me to the prom?

862
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:15,892
- So here we are.

863
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,097
You and me.

864
01:04:19,937 --> 01:04:20,770
- Damon.

865
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:24,570
You make my heart pound, Dottie.

866
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,921
You make it pound so hard it hurts.

867
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:29,344
Do I make your heart pound?

868
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:30,886
Do I?

869
01:04:30,886 --> 01:04:32,942
- Please don't.

870
01:04:32,942 --> 01:04:34,715
- Don't fight it.

871
01:04:34,715 --> 01:04:37,800
You're a strong and beautiful woman.

872
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,404
Just let the barriers down.

873
01:04:39,404 --> 01:04:42,312
We're here, right here, right now.

874
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,395
Just kiss me.

875
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:45,911
Kiss me, Dottie.

876
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,950
(glass clatters)

877
01:05:25,616 --> 01:05:27,866
(groaning)

878
01:05:30,312 --> 01:05:33,145
(heavy breathing)

879
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:38,648
(groaning)

880
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:40,645
Oh.

881
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,679
(groans)

882
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:06,854
- (screams) Get off!

883
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:27,845
I went along with it
willingly, except for the end.

884
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:32,885
It's this house.

885
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:38,303
- What do you mean it's this house?

886
01:06:38,303 --> 01:06:41,303
- [Eugene] Shit, the power went out.

887
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:49,513
- The first time that
I came to this house,

888
01:06:52,277 --> 01:06:55,110
I was with my best friend Tiffany.

889
01:06:56,296 --> 01:06:59,729
(thunder rumbles)

890
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:03,146
I guess there was nine or ten of us here.

891
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:07,824
Soon after we got here,

892
01:07:09,647 --> 01:07:12,647
the owner's son Davey, told us about

893
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:16,834
his great-great-grandfather who was

894
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:19,501
burnt to death here by his wife.

895
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:22,787
Davey said--

896
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:31,556
he said that the spirit
still roamed this house.

897
01:07:32,909 --> 01:07:34,826
- It really is haunted?

898
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:38,244
- There's something.

899
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:41,904
I mean, we didn't just
talk ourselves into it.

900
01:07:41,904 --> 01:07:42,904
- Into what?

901
01:07:46,588 --> 01:07:50,755
- Davey said that the spirit
would make us feel sexy.

902
01:07:57,769 --> 01:07:59,352
It was unavoidable.

903
01:08:02,816 --> 01:08:04,149
We just laughed.

904
01:08:05,153 --> 01:08:09,070
But he said that the
spirit was very persuasive

905
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:14,228
and that sooner or later we'd play.

906
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:15,061
- Play?

907
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:17,461
- Sex games.

908
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:23,577
- It wasn't long after that that

909
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:27,907
we started to hear this whispering.

910
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,995
- I've heard whispers.

911
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:31,995
- So have I.

912
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:36,624
- We were smoking and drinking

913
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:42,321
and our inhibitions just seemed to vanish.

914
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:50,608
We started having sex.

915
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:54,269
Lots of sex.

916
01:08:57,454 --> 01:08:59,871
We were sharing and swapping.

917
01:09:03,225 --> 01:09:06,392
And things just got wilder and wilder.

918
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,317
Somebody had a whip.

919
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:27,226
There was Tiffany.

920
01:09:34,721 --> 01:09:35,971
I see his eyes.

921
01:09:38,027 --> 01:09:40,027
I don't know who it was.

922
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:48,151
I lost my best friend that day. (sobs)

923
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:58,294
- Let's say for argument's sake that

924
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,563
the house has a presence.

925
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,813
And we've all heard sounds.

926
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,671
I mean, the supposed law
here is sex, not violence.

927
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:10,754
Isn't that right, Dottie?

928
01:10:12,349 --> 01:10:15,349
I mean, the house has an
aphrodisiacal effect on people.

929
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:17,894
Isn't that what Davey said?

930
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:19,144
- [Dottie] Yes.

931
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:24,664
- Did he say it makes people kill?

932
01:10:25,663 --> 01:10:27,205
- No.

933
01:10:27,205 --> 01:10:30,162
- Well, just because
one person flipped out

934
01:10:30,162 --> 01:10:33,495
doesn't mean someone else will flip out.

935
01:10:34,598 --> 01:10:37,004
I mean, the law here is sex, not violence.

936
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:39,292
I for one am appalled by violence.

937
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:40,743
- [Eugene] Absolutely.

938
01:10:40,743 --> 01:10:41,576
I am too.

939
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:50,005
- And Dottie, I'd like to apologize.

940
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:56,797
I'm sorry for the way I behaved earlier.

941
01:10:57,926 --> 01:10:59,259
- I'm sorry too.

942
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,377
- What did she mean she saw his eyes?

943
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,723
- She's crazy, she talks too much.

944
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:11,859
I told her not to say anything.

945
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:13,178
- You talked to her?

946
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:14,826
What did you say, you told her I'm here?

947
01:11:14,826 --> 01:11:15,659
- No.

948
01:11:16,659 --> 01:11:19,860
I told her that Chad did it. (laughs)

949
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,943
Mad mad Chad.

950
01:11:22,267 --> 01:11:25,606
I didn't say nothing about you.

951
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:28,273
She shoulda kept her mouth shut.

952
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:33,526
(eerie music)

953
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,343
- Nice of you to join us.

954
01:11:43,097 --> 01:11:45,009
Remind me next time we're on location

955
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,846
to pack at least three cases
of wine in the grip truck.

956
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:49,679
- [Eugene] You got it.

957
01:11:50,593 --> 01:11:54,649
- Bob must be going nuts
not being able to call.

958
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:56,952
- He must be very insecure, this Bob.

959
01:11:56,952 --> 01:11:59,202
Does he have a small penis?

960
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:05,221
- So what if he does?

961
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:08,880
- Well, it makes him
feel rather inadequate

962
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,130
and he takes it out on you.

963
01:12:13,307 --> 01:12:15,363
I bet he prefers oral sex.

964
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:18,540
- Do you really think we
ought to still be doing this?

965
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,158
It's just that we're back
on the same subject again.

966
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:22,386
- Why not?

967
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:24,162
You feel okay, don't you Dottie?

968
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,919
- Actually, I feel pretty good.

969
01:12:26,919 --> 01:12:28,928
- Well, back to cunnilingus.

970
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,409
- Damon?

971
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:32,742
I need to ask you something.

972
01:12:35,494 --> 01:12:37,069
It's about hypnosis.

973
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:38,402
- What about it?

974
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,916
- How good are you really?

975
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:43,285
- Let me put it like this.

976
01:12:43,285 --> 01:12:45,635
I'm better than the mouse
that satisfied the elephant

977
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:49,802
and he must have been
fucking good. (laughs)

978
01:12:50,902 --> 01:12:52,069
- I'm serious.

979
01:12:52,922 --> 01:12:54,326
- So am I.

980
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,274
I'm damn good.

981
01:12:56,274 --> 01:12:58,750
Put myself through college doing it.

982
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,042
I can make a person smarter.

983
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:04,887
I can even make a woman's
breasts grow larger.

984
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:07,470
What can I do for you, Brianna?

985
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:12,817
- Could you, for example,

986
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:18,213
make someone who's never
had an orgasm have one?

987
01:13:18,213 --> 01:13:21,463
- Well, I can do that without hypnosis.

988
01:13:22,804 --> 01:13:27,734
On second thought, that may be
a more appropriate way to go.

989
01:13:27,734 --> 01:13:30,567
Are we talking about you, Brianna?

990
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:35,446
Sleep.

991
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,917
You're in a place called
Tranquility, Brianna.

992
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:50,000
It's very peaceful and warm and safe.

993
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:56,199
You can return here anytime you want.

994
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,532
How do you feel?

995
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:00,524
- I feel fine.

996
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,474
- Do you feel warm?

997
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:05,557
- Yeah, cozy.

998
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:08,217
- Good.

999
01:14:11,216 --> 01:14:12,049
- Brianna.

1000
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,128
Your subconscious mind knows
why you don't enjoy sex.

1001
01:14:18,128 --> 01:14:20,141
I want you to leave Tranquility

1002
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:22,501
and search through your memory records

1003
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:26,668
for any sign that'll show
you why you don't enjoy sex.

1004
01:14:27,765 --> 01:14:29,515
Leave now and search.

1005
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:43,608
- Stop it, don't. (whimpers)

1006
01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:47,786
- What's happening?

1007
01:14:50,913 --> 01:14:52,609
What's happening, Brianna?

1008
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:53,709
- Just stop it!

1009
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:56,105
- Brianna, Brianna, this is just a memory.

1010
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:58,686
When I count to three the pain will leave.

1011
01:14:58,686 --> 01:15:00,148
You just have a memory.

1012
01:15:00,148 --> 01:15:01,481
One, two, three.

1013
01:15:06,713 --> 01:15:07,880
Where are you?

1014
01:15:08,793 --> 01:15:11,626
- I'm in my bedroom with Danny Ray

1015
01:15:15,157 --> 01:15:16,419
and he's trying to put it in

1016
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:19,002
and I really don't want him to.

1017
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:22,260
- How old are you?

1018
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:23,260
- Almost 14.

1019
01:15:25,214 --> 01:15:27,951
- Danny was your boyfriend?

1020
01:15:27,951 --> 01:15:29,951
- Yeah, of course he is.

1021
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:37,681
- Why don't you want him to put it in?

1022
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:39,431
- Because it's wrong.

1023
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,003
- Why is it wrong?

1024
01:15:45,088 --> 01:15:46,338
- I don't know.

1025
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:51,459
- Brianna.

1026
01:15:53,827 --> 01:15:56,827
I want you to go back, further back,

1027
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,994
back to the first time that

1028
01:16:01,994 --> 01:16:04,911
you ever learnt that sex was wrong.

1029
01:16:14,518 --> 01:16:15,685
Where are you?

1030
01:16:18,724 --> 01:16:22,141
- I'm on my bunk and I'm cold and I'm wet

1031
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:26,261
and I went pee on myself

1032
01:16:27,509 --> 01:16:29,682
and Mommy says I'm a monster

1033
01:16:29,682 --> 01:16:32,182
and that I'm gonna burn in hell.

1034
01:16:32,182 --> 01:16:33,015
- Why?

1035
01:16:33,015 --> 01:16:35,323
- I don't want to go to
hell, I don't want to.

1036
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:36,515
- Brianna, this is just a memory.

1037
01:16:36,515 --> 01:16:39,182
- I don't want to, please don't.

1038
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:42,574
- There is no pain.

1039
01:16:44,575 --> 01:16:45,742
Where are you?

1040
01:16:50,687 --> 01:16:53,020
- Mommy spanks me and Colin.

1041
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:55,454
- Colin's your brother?

1042
01:16:55,454 --> 01:16:56,287
- Yes.

1043
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:01,959
- Tell me the whole story.

1044
01:17:01,959 --> 01:17:02,959
- I was bad.

1045
01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:06,118
- Why?

1046
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:07,368
- I don't know.

1047
01:17:11,395 --> 01:17:13,665
- I think that you do.

1048
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:15,090
It's okay to tell me, Brianna.

1049
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:18,340
You'll feel much better if you tell me.

1050
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:22,931
- I made Colin touch my 'gina.

1051
01:17:24,156 --> 01:17:26,073
- Because it felt good?

1052
01:17:27,474 --> 01:17:31,641
- He saw me rubbing it and
he wanted to rub it for me

1053
01:17:33,128 --> 01:17:37,463
and he told my mom and I
don't want to burn in hell.

1054
01:17:37,463 --> 01:17:38,562
I don't want to--

1055
01:17:38,562 --> 01:17:41,562
- Brianna, this is just a memory.

1056
01:17:41,562 --> 01:17:44,239
Brianna, this is just a memory.

1057
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,221
At your real age you don't believe

1058
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:48,638
people go to hell for having sex, do you?

1059
01:17:51,609 --> 01:17:54,964
Let's put the memory into perspective.

1060
01:17:54,964 --> 01:17:57,627
Nothing bad is going to happen to you,

1061
01:17:57,627 --> 01:17:59,127
do you understand?

1062
01:18:01,563 --> 01:18:04,980
Your mother was just trying to scare you.

1063
01:18:06,747 --> 01:18:07,997
- I understand.

1064
01:18:09,694 --> 01:18:13,611
- Now that you know that,
you feel much better.

1065
01:18:17,147 --> 01:18:21,049
You no longer ever have to feel guilty

1066
01:18:21,049 --> 01:18:24,632
for enjoying sex and
enjoying masturbation.

1067
01:18:26,126 --> 01:18:30,232
You'll be fulfilled
whenever you so desire.

1068
01:18:30,232 --> 01:18:31,899
You'll have orgasms.

1069
01:18:33,456 --> 01:18:37,039
Brianna, do you want
to have an orgasm now?

1070
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,547
- Just like that, right now?

1071
01:18:43,209 --> 01:18:46,831
- When I clap my hands
you'll be outside a door

1072
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:48,664
marked sexual fantasy.

1073
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,042
Are you there?

1074
01:18:55,042 --> 01:18:56,234
- Yes.

1075
01:18:56,234 --> 01:18:58,734
- Then open the door, open it.

1076
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:02,439
- Is it open?

1077
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:03,272
- Yes.

1078
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:05,578
- Then go in.

1079
01:19:06,518 --> 01:19:10,420
- Over there on the bed is Kevin Costner.

1080
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,499
He's smiling at you.

1081
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,332
- No.

1082
01:19:14,402 --> 01:19:16,261
- He's not smiling?

1083
01:19:16,261 --> 01:19:17,511
- It's not him.

1084
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:23,094
- Who is lying there, Brianna?

1085
01:19:24,168 --> 01:19:28,335
Who is your ultimate sexual
fantasy partner lying there?

1086
01:19:29,729 --> 01:19:31,472
- Alex Trebek.

1087
01:19:31,472 --> 01:19:33,327
- From the Jeopardy Show?

1088
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:34,744
- [Brianna] Yeah.

1089
01:19:36,879 --> 01:19:38,655
- What's he doing?

1090
01:19:38,655 --> 01:19:40,405
- He's looking at me.

1091
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:45,417
He's lusting for me, he wants me.

1092
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:48,244
- I'll have orgasms for 300, Alex please.

1093
01:19:48,244 --> 01:19:49,077
- Shh.

1094
01:19:50,254 --> 01:19:51,746
He's coming towards you.

1095
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:52,777
- Yes.

1096
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:54,860
- He's going to kiss you.

1097
01:19:59,353 --> 01:20:00,936
- How does he kiss?

1098
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:04,006
(groans)

1099
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:07,601
Show me where his hands are.

1100
01:20:07,601 --> 01:20:10,101
Show me how he's touching you.

1101
01:20:14,236 --> 01:20:15,849
Are you touching him?

1102
01:20:15,849 --> 01:20:16,682
- Yes.

1103
01:20:21,293 --> 01:20:24,960
- He's gonna put his
hands inside your robe.

1104
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,746
he's gonna put his tongue on your breasts.

1105
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:46,136
He's there, isn't he Brianna?

1106
01:20:46,136 --> 01:20:46,969
- Oh yes.

1107
01:20:46,969 --> 01:20:48,004
- He knows the spot.

1108
01:20:48,004 --> 01:20:49,045
Let him take it.

1109
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:51,218
let him take it, Brianna, no holding back.

1110
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:53,218
- Yes, take me, take me.

1111
01:20:58,158 --> 01:20:59,813
(groans)

1112
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:01,813
(sighs)

1113
01:21:16,566 --> 01:21:19,733
Cover yourself up before you get cold.

1114
01:21:21,987 --> 01:21:25,915
I'm going to count backwards from five.

1115
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:28,832
You'll be back awake in the present

1116
01:21:31,556 --> 01:21:33,976
with your five companions.

1117
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:36,309
Five, four, three, two, one,

1118
01:21:39,711 --> 01:21:40,544
awake.

1119
01:22:12,622 --> 01:22:16,789
Well, now that we've
unleashed your hidden passion,

1120
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:24,084
maybe we should talk about you and me.

1121
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:30,958
- Damon, I really, really
appreciate what you've done.

1122
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:38,841
But I'm still not gonna fuck you.

1123
01:22:56,488 --> 01:22:59,071
(eerie music)

1124
01:23:19,952 --> 01:23:22,035
(groans)

1125
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:27,049
(sighs)

1126
01:24:14,597 --> 01:24:15,430
(moans)

1127
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,263
- Shh.

1128
01:24:21,285 --> 01:24:23,869
- Don't touch what you can't afford.

1129
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:25,444
- I'm just trying to
release some of the tension

1130
01:24:25,444 --> 01:24:28,004
caused by the Bob man.

1131
01:24:28,004 --> 01:24:30,281
Come on, you can't tell
me it doesn't feel good.

1132
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:31,114
Well okay.

1133
01:24:31,976 --> 01:24:32,827
Just don't--

1134
01:24:32,827 --> 01:24:34,790
- [Damon] Don't worry, I'm
not going to try anything.

1135
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:37,290
(muted cries)

1136
01:24:54,343 --> 01:24:55,176
- Fuck me!

1137
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:56,929
Fuck me.

1138
01:25:02,023 --> 01:25:02,856
Yes!

1139
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:37,939
- Truth.

1140
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:40,356
You are a fucking whore slut.

1141
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:44,154
- Truth, Marla, I couldn't help myself.

1142
01:25:44,154 --> 01:25:46,907
Shooter means nothing to me.

1143
01:25:46,907 --> 01:25:48,716
- Why my man?

1144
01:25:48,716 --> 01:25:49,549
Huh?

1145
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:52,096
Why not him?

1146
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:55,468
- It wasn't supposed to be either.

1147
01:25:55,468 --> 01:25:56,301
- I mean it.

1148
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:57,301
- Excuse me?

1149
01:25:59,183 --> 01:26:01,193
- It's just what she said, it's just--

1150
01:26:01,193 --> 01:26:02,725
- Shut up.

1151
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:03,558
- It just happened.

1152
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:04,391
- Shut up!

1153
01:26:07,712 --> 01:26:10,629
- Look Marla, I'm sorry I hurt you.

1154
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:14,458
- Enjoy yourselves, girls.

1155
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:30,685
- I want you off the Johnson shoot.

1156
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,660
- What?

1157
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,576
(sobs)

1158
01:26:33,576 --> 01:26:36,076
- You cause too much friction.

1159
01:26:43,706 --> 01:26:46,380
- Do you want to fuck, Damon?

1160
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,548
- You?

1161
01:26:47,548 --> 01:26:49,577
- Am I not good enough?

1162
01:26:49,577 --> 01:26:51,099
- What do you want from me?

1163
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:51,932
- [Eugene] I said that I'm sorry,

1164
01:26:51,932 --> 01:26:53,786
it just happened, I'm sorry.

1165
01:26:53,786 --> 01:26:55,453
- Fuck off, asshole.

1166
01:26:56,354 --> 01:26:58,564
- I love you, Marla.

1167
01:26:58,564 --> 01:27:00,543
- Come on, Damon.

1168
01:27:00,543 --> 01:27:01,588
- You lay a hand on her and I'll--

1169
01:27:01,588 --> 01:27:02,603
- And what?

1170
01:27:02,603 --> 01:27:05,490
What are you gonna do about it?

1171
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,725
- Throw a couple logs in the fire.

1172
01:27:06,725 --> 01:27:08,225
We may be a while.

1173
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:14,139
- Would you do it again?

1174
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,870
- With Shooter?

1175
01:27:20,607 --> 01:27:23,440
Gee Kel, honey, don't ask me that.

1176
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:29,626
- Where is everybody?

1177
01:27:29,626 --> 01:27:31,118
- Who cares.

1178
01:27:31,118 --> 01:27:32,618
- Yeah, who cares.

1179
01:27:54,089 --> 01:27:56,916
- Damon, it's no biggie.

1180
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:59,734
I mean, it's no big deal.

1181
01:27:59,734 --> 01:28:00,651
It happens.

1182
01:28:04,313 --> 01:28:06,146
- Yeah, but not to me.

1183
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:32,104
(groans)

1184
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:33,021
- His eyes.

1185
01:28:34,998 --> 01:28:35,831
His eyes.

1186
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:37,834
His eyes.

1187
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,036
No, Lorne.

1188
01:28:55,062 --> 01:28:57,992
- He didn't allow us to keep you, Missy.

1189
01:28:57,992 --> 01:28:59,184
You belong to me.

1190
01:28:59,184 --> 01:29:00,267
- Please, no.

1191
01:29:02,902 --> 01:29:07,069
- This'll make it better,
just like it was before.

1192
01:29:14,187 --> 01:29:15,020
Come on.

1193
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:17,731
This way.

1194
01:29:22,339 --> 01:29:23,329
- No!

1195
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:25,162
- There you go, Missy.

1196
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,118
- Spirit?

1197
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:32,458
- Spirit can't help you now.

1198
01:30:02,298 --> 01:30:03,131
- Dead.

1199
01:30:04,248 --> 01:30:05,748
Both of you, dead.

1200
01:30:10,192 --> 01:30:11,025
- Bob.

1201
01:30:11,025 --> 01:30:12,278
Oh my God, what the
hell are you doing here?

1202
01:30:12,278 --> 01:30:13,977
- I just knew you had
to be fucking someone.

1203
01:30:13,977 --> 01:30:14,888
- I was gonna call.

1204
01:30:14,888 --> 01:30:15,806
- [Bob] Don't lie to me.

1205
01:30:15,806 --> 01:30:17,482
- I'm not lying.

1206
01:30:17,482 --> 01:30:21,103
I swear, I don't want it to end this way.

1207
01:30:21,103 --> 01:30:23,627
- so you pick this piece of shit over me?

1208
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:24,558
- No.

1209
01:30:24,558 --> 01:30:26,020
I'm not picking either one of you.

1210
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,613
I just need some time to myself.

1211
01:30:28,613 --> 01:30:29,446
- Fuck!

1212
01:30:35,049 --> 01:30:35,882
- Hello?

1213
01:30:35,882 --> 01:30:36,799
Hello, sir?

1214
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:40,026
Could we catch a ride?

1215
01:30:40,026 --> 01:30:41,109
- [Bob] Sure.

1216
01:30:45,977 --> 01:30:47,894
- Marla, wait a minute.

1217
01:30:52,132 --> 01:30:53,132
Marla, wait!

1218
01:30:54,165 --> 01:30:54,998
Wait.

1219
01:30:59,428 --> 01:31:00,261
Fuck.

1220
01:31:03,217 --> 01:31:04,050
Fuck.

1221
01:31:16,665 --> 01:31:17,844
- Well first there were six little piggies

1222
01:31:17,844 --> 01:31:20,591
and then there were three.

1223
01:31:20,591 --> 01:31:21,424
- And when are there going to

1224
01:31:21,424 --> 01:31:24,750
be two as they're supposed to be?

1225
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,969
- Want to see what I found downstairs?

1226
01:31:26,969 --> 01:31:28,238
- What did you discover?

1227
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:31,462
- I discovered Dottie's bedroom.

1228
01:31:31,462 --> 01:31:32,487
- You did?

1229
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,528
- Mm hmm.

1230
01:31:33,528 --> 01:31:34,361
- [Kelly] Where?

1231
01:31:34,361 --> 01:31:35,421
- Where?

1232
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:36,753
Downstairs.

1233
01:31:36,753 --> 01:31:38,505
It's incredible.

1234
01:31:38,505 --> 01:31:40,177
Full of old antique toys.

1235
01:31:40,177 --> 01:31:41,476
- [Brianna] No way.

1236
01:31:41,476 --> 01:31:42,309
- Yes way.

1237
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,064
This way.

1238
01:31:51,509 --> 01:31:54,509
(suspenseful music)

1239
01:32:09,693 --> 01:32:10,526
(gasps)

1240
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:12,400
Jesus Christ.

1241
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,567
(screams)

1242
01:32:17,268 --> 01:32:20,185
- Don't touch him, leave him alone.

1243
01:32:21,648 --> 01:32:22,956
Kelly, stay behind me Kelly.

1244
01:32:22,956 --> 01:32:25,703
- (calls) Come on, come on.

1245
01:32:25,703 --> 01:32:28,036
(screaming)

1246
01:32:32,035 --> 01:32:34,202
(gasping)

1247
01:33:13,196 --> 01:33:14,029
- [Dottie] Stop.

1248
01:33:14,029 --> 01:33:14,978
- What?

1249
01:33:14,978 --> 01:33:16,237
- Stop the truck.

1250
01:33:16,237 --> 01:33:17,959
We have to go back.

1251
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:19,626
- You wanna go back?

1252
01:33:41,551 --> 01:33:44,384
(muted screaming)

1253
01:34:06,668 --> 01:34:07,501
- Kelly?

1254
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:08,888
- Bri. (gasps)

1255
01:34:08,888 --> 01:34:10,393
- [Brianna] Where is he?

1256
01:34:10,393 --> 01:34:11,643
- I don't know.

1257
01:34:17,967 --> 01:34:20,300
I thought he went after you.

1258
01:34:22,102 --> 01:34:23,102
- Oh Christ.

1259
01:34:27,498 --> 01:34:28,915
(groans)

1260
01:34:28,915 --> 01:34:31,665
(knife clatters)

1261
01:34:42,033 --> 01:34:42,866
- Spirit?

1262
01:34:44,967 --> 01:34:45,884
No, Spirit.

1263
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:47,843
- No.

1264
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:03,563
- Get off her.

1265
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,191
Don't make me use this.

1266
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:09,384
- Yeah, I'll get off her.

1267
01:35:09,384 --> 01:35:10,217
- No!

1268
01:35:10,217 --> 01:35:12,147
(screams)

1269
01:35:12,147 --> 01:35:13,632
- You bitch.

1270
01:35:13,632 --> 01:35:15,215
You fucking bitch--

1271
01:35:16,132 --> 01:35:18,010
(groans)

1272
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:19,085
- Are you alright?

1273
01:35:19,085 --> 01:35:19,918
- Yeah.

1274
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:23,552
- Kelly?

1275
01:35:34,612 --> 01:35:37,279
(ominous music)

1276
01:36:17,985 --> 01:36:20,152
- What's going on in here?

1277
01:36:23,095 --> 01:36:25,662
It's hot in here, isn't it?

1278
01:36:25,662 --> 01:36:27,745
(laughs)

1279
01:36:28,989 --> 01:36:31,239
(laughter)

1280
01:36:33,338 --> 01:36:35,755
