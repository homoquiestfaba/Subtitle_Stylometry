00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:28,419
<i>All
right, 1-10, this is Dispatch.</i>

00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:29,952

what's your 20?</i>

00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,429

the corner, Marianne.</i>

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,798
<i>We've got a 4-1-5</i>

<i>at 68th South Corbine Street.</i>

<i>American Bank.</i>

13
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:21,038
<i>Suspect is driving
a white sedan. I repeat.</i>

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,607
<i>Suspect is armed
and driving a white sedan.</i>

15
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,576
<i>1-10 en route.</i>

16
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>We got a visual
on a white sedan</i>

17
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,083
<i>going south on Main.</i>

18
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:35,553
<i>Repeat. Going south on Main,</i>

19
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,621
<i>heading toward
the I-35 on-ramp.</i>

20
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:39,756
<i>We are in pursuit,

21
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:41,357
<i>You got a visual?</i>

22
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,559
<i>Adam, four seconds.</i>

23
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,863
<i>We'll catch up with him.</i>

24
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,653
<i>Dispatch, we found
our white sedan, over.</i>

25
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,157
<i>Are you requesting backup?</i>

26
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,690
<i>Uh, no sign of the suspect.</i>

27
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,895
<i>Just in case,
it's a blue car.</i>

28
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,966
<i>All units,
on north I-35 in pursuit.</i>

29
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,135
<i>Suspect now believed

<i>a blue four-door sedan.</i>

31
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:27,804

<i>State Highway Patrol's

33
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,808
<i>10-4. All right.</i>

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,022
Hey, excuse me.
Need some help?

35
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,860
No, I'm good. Well...

36
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,327
Damn thing started choking up
about a mile back.

37
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,996
I tried to make it
to the next exit

38
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,297
but it conked out.

39
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,601
Let me take a look.

40
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,903
Think it's the radiator?

41
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,844
It could be.

42
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:08,046
Is it shot?

43
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,816
I wouldn't be surprised.

44
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:16,320
You know anything
about cars?

45
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,091
Uh, no, not really.

46
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,800
So, where you headed?

47
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,068
Oh, nowhere, really.

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,740
- Just driving, huh?
- Hmm. Just driving.

49
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,708
Hey, I like
that truck of yours.

50
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,579
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Yeah?

51
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:44,816
I stole it.

52
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:46,952
Did you?

53
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:52,791
No.

54
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,391
It was my husband's.

55
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:56,595
Oh.

56
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:59,232
Where's he at?

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,734
Well, he's...

58
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:07,239
He's dead. That's...
That's where he's at.

59
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,341
Oh.

60
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,143
Can I ask you your name?

61
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,178
Jewel.

62
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,412
- Jewel?
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,181
- That's your name?
- Yup.

64
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:19,616
Why? You don't believe me?

65
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:21,484
No, I believe you.
It's just, uh...

66
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:22,854
well, it does suit you.

67
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:24,723
Can say that.

68
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,024
So, what about you?
What's your name,

69
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:30,294
Mr. All-Dressed-Up
- In-A-Blue Suit?

70
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:33,099
I'm Bob.
I'm Bob Callahan.

71
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,366
<i>So, where are you headed?</i>

72
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:36,666
<i>Home.</i>

73
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,135
I've been on the road
for a while.

74
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,036
Doing what?

75
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:41,404
Oh, this and that.
I'm in sales.

76
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,671
Oh. Selling what?

77
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,907
<i>As I said,
a little of this...</i>

78
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,377
<i>...little of that.</i>

79
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,111
What are you looking for?

80
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,186
- So, you like horses?
- What?

81
00:04:57,188 --> 00:05:00,590
- That thing you're...
- Oh! Yes! Yeah, I do.

82
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,327
So, you're a cowgirl
who likes stealing cars?

83
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:05,861
- What else am I missing?
- That's pretty much it.

84
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:07,863
I have three horses.
I live in the country.

85
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,500
- Three horses?
- I love to ride.

86
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,633
- Yeah.
- What are their names?

87
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,501
- The horses?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,537
Wiley, Clementine,
and Dorothy Jean.

89
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,138
Dorothy Jean?

90
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,442
Sounds like my kinda gal.
Dorothy Jean.

91
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,743
Do you ride?

92
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,911
Me? No.
No, never. Never have.

93
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:24,582
- But it's on my list.
- What list is that?

94
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,450
Things I want to do
but haven't done yet.

95
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:27,954
Well, you better hurry up.

96
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,223
Yeah, how come?

97
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:34,123
Anything else?

98
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,892
- No. No, I think we're good.
- No, thank you.

99
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:37,193
All right then.
Whenever you're ready.

100
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,495
Thank you. Sure.

101
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,964
No, no! You gave me a lift.
This is the least I can do.

102
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,036
- No, no, don't worry about it.
- Please, I insist.

103
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,380
Thank you.

104
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:05,087
So, uh, what did you say
you do? Sales?

105
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,558
- Yeah.
- Like door-to-door?

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,493
- Uh, no, no, no.
- Bible salesman?

107
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,794
No, definitely not. No.

108
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:12,830
I'm kidding.

109
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,401
Uh... can I tell you something?

110
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,736
I don't know
the first thing about sales.

111
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:21,772
- Oh.
- I just made it up.

112
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:23,907
Well, what do you do then?

113
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,476
Well, that's a secret.

114
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,344
- Oh, is it now?
- Yeah.

115
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,580
And why is that?

116
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:30,781
Well, because if I told you,

117
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,048
you probably wouldn't want
to see me again.

118
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,750
Who said
I was gonna see you again?

119
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:35,288
Would you?

120
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
This is...

121
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,034
- You're not serious, are you?
- I am.

122
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:28,203
- This is a joke.
- I'm serious.

123
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:29,940
- Oh, come on.
- No, joke. No, it's no joke.

124
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,877
Why would you
even tell me, then?

125
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,546
Well, I think
because I trust you.

126
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,115
You just met me.

127
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,118
Well, sometimes
you just know is all.

128
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,488
With me, you know?

129
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:45,255
Well, you're still
sitting here.

130
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,056
Well, that's because
I don't believe you.

131
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:49,428
And if I did believe you...

132
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,061
So, what'd be worse?

133
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,399
If I'm lying about this
or telling you the truth?

134
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,703
Prove it.

135
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:02,238
- Prove it?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,409
- You want me to prove it?
- Yeah.

137
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,979
What'll you do if I can?

138
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,548
I won't walk out that door.

139
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:17,955
No, I'm not gonna do it.

140
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,289
I didn't think so.

141
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,459
Not because I can't.

142
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,495
Because it's just
not my style.

143
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:26,363
- Not your style?
- Mnh-mnh.

144
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:27,763
- You have style?
- I do.

145
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:30,668
Well, uh, tell me
what that is then.

146
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,369
- My style?
- Yeah.

147
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:36,041
Okay, well,
let's take this place.

148
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,976
This place is not my style.

149
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,447
Say it was a bank.

150
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:43,813
And instead of that counter
up there,

151
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,448
that was really
a teller's window.

152
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,616
And that lady standing there

153
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,519
was the teller
behind the window.

154
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,886
And you just walk in,
real calm,

155
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,255
and you'd find yourself a spot

156
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,255
- and you'd sit down...
- Hold your horses!

157
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:55,458
...just like we're sitting here.

158
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,360
And you wait and you watch.

159
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,962
And that may take
a couple of hours,

160
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,731
might take
a couple of days, even.

161
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,798
But you wait.
It's gotta feel right.

162
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,168
The timing has to feel right.

163
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,572
And when it does feel right,
you make your move.

164
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,941
So you walk right up,
look her in the eye,

165
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:14,178
and you say,
"Ma'am, this is a robbery."

166
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,048
And you show her the gun,
like this.

167
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:17,981
You say, "I want you
to fill that bag

168
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,348
"with money,
hand it over to me.

169
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,320
"And don't do anything stupid
or foolish.

170
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,053
"I wouldn't want you
to get hurt.

171
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:25,291
"'Cause I like you.

172
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:27,993
"I like you a lot.

173
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:32,095
"As a matter of fact, I might
even be falling for you,

174
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,264
so don't go breaking
my heart now, okay."

175
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,000
So, she'd fill up
the bag with money.

176
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:38,202
She'd hand it over to me.

177
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,903
And I'd go out
just the way I came in,

178
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,638
real casual-like.

179
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,942
And she'd...

180
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,411
You tell me what she'd do?

181
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:57,520
Hey. I'm just
pulling your leg.

182
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:34,122
His hands were shaking.
That's what I kept noticing.

183
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:36,592
His hands were shaking
all over the place.

184
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,061
If he had pulled
that trigger,

185
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,662
I don't even think he could
have pulled the trigger,

186
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:40,996
he was so jacked up.

187
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:41,731
But if he had, I...

188
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,765
Nah. Nah. Nah.

189
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,568
You did the right thing.

190
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,637
How you feeling? You okay?

191
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:48,741
Hey. Hey, John! John!

192
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,042
I don't wanna make it
a big deal or nothing,

193
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,175
but we all pitched in

194
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:54,679
and got a little something
for you.

195
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,082
Oh, shit.
The big 4-0.

196
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,884
All downhill from here.

197
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,221
Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:14,599
We have to put all of
them in because Daddy's here.

199
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:21,071
Happy birthday!

200
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:24,274
Oh, man! What is this?

201
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,576
- A surprise!
- Why didn't you tell me?

202
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:29,612
Because then it wouldn't
have been a surprise!

203
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,614
Cake for breakfast?

204
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,217
Birthday cake for breakfast?

205
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:37,220
Sweetheart,
whose idea was this?

206
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,458
Oh, it was their idea.

207
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,767
I tried telling them.

208
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,101
Dad's going to be cranky,

209
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,871
and he's not gonna want anyone
bringing up his age.

210
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:55,105
"Dear Mr. President..."

211
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,639
They said they didn't care.

212
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,308
"...I was sorry to hear
that you got shot,

213
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,943
and I'm happy to hear
that you're feeling better."

214
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,111
What about you?

215
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,084
It's your birthday.

216
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,583
I'm not saying a thing.

217
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:09,785
"I know
you probably can't tell me

218
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,121
"because it's a secret,

219
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:13,555
"but I bet there are
lots of them

220
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:16,425
"and wonder if you play hide
and seek with the visitors.

221
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:19,996
"I hope to visit some day
and think it would be fun.

222
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,164
"Thank you
for making America safe.

223
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,634
Yours truly, Abilene Hunt."

224
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,377
<i>Car 22, do you copy?</i>

225
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,510
<i>Car 22, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy?</i>

226
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:38,381
Babe, push that red button
and tell them, "10-4."

227
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,683
10-4.

228
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:42,119
Say, "10-4, good buddy."

229
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:45,524
- 10-4, good buddy.
- Hey, I wanna do it!

230
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:50,125
Dude, tell her...
push the red button...

231
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:53,996
and say, "Dispatch,
this is Robbery 7."

232
00:12:53,998 --> 00:12:56,131
Dispatch, this is Robbery 7.

233
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,332
<i>Please stop messing around.</i>

234
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,269
Say, "I gotta go...
10-2 real bad."

235
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,440
I gotta go 10-2 real bad.

236
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,677
Wait, what's 10-2?

237
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:10,380
All right,
you wanna wait in the car

238
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,448
or you wanna come in?

239
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,848
- Come in.
- Wait.

240
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,351
Can I have the keys
so I can listen to the radio?

241
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,419
Yeah. And write
a note to your teacher

242
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,722
because we're all
going to be late.

243
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:19,757
Got it.

244
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:21,759
Come on.

245
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,900
Come on, buddy! 10-2.
Let's go!

246
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,217
Who you praying to this time?

247
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,016
Our Lady of, uh...

248
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,886
Rare and Periodic Attendance.

249
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,024
So, it's your choice,
all right?

250
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,025
You gotta choose?

251
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,193
Yeah!

252
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,763
Okay, so then pick
whatever you want.

253
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:35,531
I mean, you liked baseball,
didn't you?

254
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,002
- Yeah.
- Okay, so pick baseball.

255
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,004
Just pick
whatever you want to pick.

256
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,405
That's... that's the most
important thing.

257
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:44,140
Do the thing
that you want to do.

258
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,076
But make sure that
you actually like it,

259
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:47,177
you know what I mean?

260
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,745
'Cause you're stuck with it.

261
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,516
Why are you looking
at me like that?

262
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,117
Do you like your job?

263
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,953
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Can I see the manager?

264
00:14:57,955 --> 00:14:59,222
Well, that would be me.

265
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:00,789
What can I do for you
this morning?

266
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,725
Well, I'd like to ask
about a business loan.

267
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,361
Well, sure. I bet
we can help you with that.

268
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,334
Uh, what sort of business
are we talking about?

269
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,067
Oh.

270
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,671
This kind.

271
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:24,683
Sit down.

272
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,286
Dad, I'm bored.

273
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,623
What do you want me to do?

274
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,697
So, how are you feeling today?

275
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,868
Not so good,
since you're asking.

276
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,671
Well, the day's still young.

277
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,313
I'm going
to give this to you.

278
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:58,851
And what I want you to do
is fill it with money.

279
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,150
You ever hear
about that frog

280
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,619
that went to the bank
right there?

281
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,653
No.

282
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:05,690
A frog walked
into a bank one day.

283
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,192
And he walks right up to
the teller. "May I speak..."

284
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:11,026
Here they got a nameplate
and his name,

285
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:13,261
it says Mr. Paddywhack on it.

286
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,329
He walks up to him
and he says,

287
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,731
"Excuse me, Mr. Paddywhack.

288
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,833
"I'd like to talk to someone
about taking out a loan."

289
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,605
And Mr. Paddywhack looked
at him and he said...

290
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,809
"You can't get a loan.
You're just a frog."

291
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,608
And the frog says,
"That doesn't seem fair.

292
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,577
Would you go please speak
to your manager?"

293
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:29,912
So Mr. Paddywhack went back

294
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,314
and he talked to the manager
and he said...

295
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,116
"Sir, there's a frog out there

296
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,553
who's asking
about taking out a loan."

297
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,587
And his, uh, manager said,

298
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,591
"Well, does he have
any collateral?"

299
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:44,659
Collateral is something
you can, uh, get if you're...

300
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,333
hold on to to make sure that
people give their money back.

301
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,766
And he said,
"I don't know. I'll go ask."

302
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:51,903
And he sat down.

303
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,270
He goes back out to the frog
and he says,

304
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:56,675
"Do you have any collateral?"

305
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,611
And, uh, the frog took out this
little teeny, tiny glass pear,

306
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,781
and he puts it on the counter
and he said...

307
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:07,684
"That glass pear is all
I have in the world."

308
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,718
And then Mr. Paddywhack
takes it back

309
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,021
to his manager and he says...

310
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,589
So, we'll switch that
from checking to savings?

311
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:16,059
"Sir, this is all
the frog has in the world."

312
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:17,092
Thank you.

313
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:18,227
The manager
looks at him,

314
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:19,396
and he looks
at the little glass pear,

315
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,766
and he says...

316
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,269
He says, "It's a knick-knack,
Paddywhack.

317
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:28,740
Give the frog a loan."

318
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:32,342
- You get it?
- Yeah.

319
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,746
I'd like to make a deposit.

320
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:37,147
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

321
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:39,015
Please remain calm.

322
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,883
It is my duty to inform you...

323
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,254
that this bank
has just been robbed.

324
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:48,960
Step on it.

325
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,801
Now, everybody just...
Helen, I can handle this.

326
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:00,704
- Sir, you cannot leave.
- Sir! My daughter's in the car outside.

327
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,470
- The police are on their way.
- Listen... listen...

328
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,040
Okay. I am the...
I'm with the...

329
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,475
The police
will be here momentarily.

330
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:06,641
You're not listening
to what I'm telling you!

331
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:08,778
I'm with
the police department.

332
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,655
John? What the hell
are you doing here?

333
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:39,876
Did you see anybody funny

334
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:41,576
or something
that looked out of place?

335
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,246
So, how old exactly?

336
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,182
Oh, I'd say
he was about 50 or 60?

337
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:49,552
- Closer to 60?
- Yeah.

338
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:53,859
- Or 50?
- Yeah. Uh, 50 to 60.

339
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,661
Sound about right
to you, John?

340
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,897
Mm-hmm.

341
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,304
So what happened?

342
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:09,971
Are you guys, okay?

343
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:12,074
Um...

344
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:13,376
You said he was armed?

345
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,011
Yes, he had a gun.

346
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:17,112
- You saw it?
- Yes!

347
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,248
- He pointed it at you?
- Well, I... Well, no!

348
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,816
But he said
he had one! And I...

349
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:22,686
- You did what he said.
- Yes!

350
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:26,757
- Because he said he had a gun.
- Yes. And also...

351
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,796
I mean, he was also
sort of a gentleman.

352
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:16,639
She don't speak
a lick of English.

353
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:19,774
And I don't know but one
or two words in Spanish,

354
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:23,278
both of which
I employ liberally and...

355
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,882
We seem to get along
just fine.

356
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,883
<i>Bueno para ti.</i>

357
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:30,721
What am I supposed
to say to that? <i>Si?</i>

358
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:34,957
<i>Si. Absolutamente.</i>

359
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,860
Oh, man. I know
when I'm being made fun of,

360
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,330
and I'm okay
with that because

361
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,565
I've got a good sense
of humor about myself, sir.

362
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,534
I've got a good sense
of humor about you, too.

363
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,036
Yeah, right. Get the hell out.

364
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,640
She wants me to take her...

365
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:53,778
...down to Buenos Aires.

366
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:56,345
- You ever been down there?
- Nope.

367
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:59,180
Well, apparently they've got
some really good poetry.

368
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,185
You're thinking of Chile.

369
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:05,353
What's the difference?

370
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,957
What about St. Louis?
You ever been to St. Louis?

371
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,257
Sure.

372
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,194
I got an idea for
a pretty good score up there.

373
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:14,697
<i>...19 high school
ROTC cadets from Lubbock.</i>

374
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,534
<i>The man put his charges to bed
at 9:30 on Friday,</i>

375
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:20,069
<i>put on his snow shoes, and
walked down the mountain to...</i>

376
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,273
Is it on the news?

377
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,774
<i>In local news today... bees!</i>

378
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:28,279
Nope. Nobody cares.

379
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:31,783
Well, you care.

380
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:34,450
- Don't you?
- Trying to.

381
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:37,920
I can't figure out if I need
to try a whole lot harder

382
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,191
or if I should just quit.

383
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:43,159
So, you gonna quit
and do what?

384
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:46,094
I really don't know.
Something useful.

385
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,764
Something where I don't have
to clean up a mess

386
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,102
that keeps on making itself
every time I turn around.

387
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,805
Okay. You can quit.

388
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:56,741
Or you can try and catch 'em.

389
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,959
I didn't think
you'd ever actually call.

390
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,627
I didn't think you'd pick up.
So we're even.

391
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:21,497
- So, how's your truck?
- Oh, it's all fixed up.

392
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:24,167
- Yeah?
- Yeah. How about you?

393
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:25,700
You've been traveling
a lot, I guess?

394
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:27,035
Oh, yeah.

395
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:28,603
Selling a lot of Bibles?

396
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,971
Yeah. A whole lot.

397
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,873
You're looking at one
of the top five salesmen

398
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,409
in the area right here.

399
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:34,813
- Yeah?
- Yup.

400
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,350
I don't believe
a word you say.

401
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:40,752
Probably a good idea.

402
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,455
You aren't wearing
your hearing aid.

403
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:46,855
Hmm?

404
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:48,757
You're not wearing
your hearing aid!

405
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,092
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya.

406
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:51,459
You're not wearing your...

407
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,998
God.

408
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,936
Hey. Got something for ya.

409
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,443
John Hunt!

410
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:09,014
John Hunt, where is he?
There he is.

411
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,081
Looks like your
rainy-day robber is at it again.

412
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,083
Laugh it up, Columbo.
What do you got?

413
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,920
Gene Dentler sent that over.
Said it made him think of you.

414
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:21,055
That's hilarious.

415
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:22,358
Don't you worry about it, man.

416
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,963
I've already got the AARP
on the case.

417
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:30,867
Hello. Gene.

418
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,434
Hey, Gene Dentler.
It's John Hunt here.

419
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:33,836
<i>Tell me about this robbery.</i>

420
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,571
Oh, you mean the old guy?

421
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:39,774
Yeah, same story. Small haul.
No prints, no MO, no nothing.

422
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,476
So you got no leads, huh?

423
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:42,879
What a fucking surprise.

424
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,380
Mainly on account
of nobody giving a shit.

425
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,749
It's just kind
of a funny story.

426
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:50,285
Yeah. Nothing funnier
than armed robbery.

427
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:51,920
<i>Yeah.</i>

428
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:53,555
<i>Oh, you know,
speaking of funny...</i>

429
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,957
here's where
it gets interesting.

430
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,159
I told my wife
about the whole deal.

431
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,829
And I guess
she tells her sister,

432
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:02,063
'cause the next day,
her sister calls me

433
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,600
and she told me about a thing
she read in the paper

434
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:06,636
that sounds real similar.

435
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:08,871
Old guy... with a gun.

436
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:12,076
Oh, yeah? What's your, uh,
your wife's sister's name?

437
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:14,643
Hello, Marge.
I'm calling about

438
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:15,945
this robbery you had
on June 8th.

439
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:17,880
Is that case still open?

440
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,584
Yes, ma'am. Would you fax it
to me? Thank you.

441
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:24,555
Now, what do you mean
when you say more than one?

442
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:26,958
Two?

443
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:32,794
Excuse me.

444
00:24:32,796 --> 00:24:33,862
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

445
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:35,296
I'd like to open up
an account.

446
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:38,766
Oh, great. What type of account
do you have in mind?

447
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,438
This kind.

448
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,108
This kind.

449
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:46,476
This kind.

450
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:57,589
This enough for you?

451
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:00,257
Keep 'em coming,
please, Patty.

452
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:13,138
God! Can I get some help?

453
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,772
<i>Okay, what we have here
is five states.</i>

454
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,373
- 93 robberies.
- In two years.

455
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,342
And you think
it's all the same guys?

456
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,310
Hundred percent.

457
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,812
So, how do
the same three guys

458
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,179
get away with all that?

459
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,348
<i>Well, they haven't
gotten away with it.</i>

460
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,216
<i>They just haven't
been caught yet.</i>

461
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:28,551
<i>So, what do you want to do?</i>

462
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:29,650
- What do we want to do?
- Yeah.

463
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:30,585
We're going to catch 'em.

464
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:31,589
We're going to catch 'em.

465
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:39,164
Hello.

466
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:07,258
Oh. You crying? Don't cry.

467
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,659
What are you crying for?

468
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:11,627
This is my first day.

469
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:12,861
Well, there's always
a first time

470
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,132
for everything, isn't there?

471
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,134
Chin up.

472
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,038
Okay.

473
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,209
You're doing a great job.

474
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:32,848
<i>And how would you
describe him?</i>

475
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,921
Well, he was, uh...
he was very polite.

476
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,988
He seemed like
a nice enough fella.

477
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,257
- He was...
- Let me guess.

478
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:45,561
- Uh, he was a gentleman.
- Well, yeah.

479
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,265
But he was more...

480
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:51,235
- He just seemed happy.
- Happy?

481
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,005
Yeah.

482
00:26:54,972 --> 00:26:57,942
Did he look like either
of these two guys here?

483
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,811
Yeah. Sorta. I gue...

484
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:05,050
He... he just seemed more...

485
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,085
Happy.

486
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:32,309
Come on!

487
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:37,446
It looks terrible now

488
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,947
because I started
stripping the paper off

489
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,181
thinking I'd change it.

490
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:43,585
But then I found this
on the plaster...

491
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:46,354
and I couldn't bring myself
to cover it up.

492
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:49,057
I looked it up. That's the guy
that built this house.

493
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:51,092
He signed that
about 100 years ago,

494
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:52,730
and it's still there.

495
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,133
Wiley here,
I've had since he was born

496
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,101
and Clementine...

497
00:28:00,103 --> 00:28:01,469
Clementine belonged
to our neighbors,

498
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,605
but she kept busting
through our fence.

499
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:04,640
So, we...

500
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,344
We finally just gave up
and bought her.

501
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:11,813
So... all this
belongs to you, huh?

502
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,549
Yup.

503
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,186
- Wow.
- Me and the bank.

504
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:18,821
Hmm.

505
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,691
My kids keep telling me
to sell it,

506
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:22,957
but I love it too much.

507
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:26,461
They say
it's too expensive

508
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:29,800
or that it's too much for me
to handle on my own, but...

509
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,267
I say, well, come on out

510
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,805
and give me a hand, then.

511
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,175
I'm not going anywhere.

512
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:43,148
You're not married, are ya?

513
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,850
No... Me? No.

514
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:48,819
I was once though.
That was when I was young.

515
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,488
Got any kids?

516
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,792
I hope not.

517
00:28:58,328 --> 00:28:59,995
- 75...
- Yeah.

518
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,229
- ...76...
- Yes.

519
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,296
- ...77...
- Yup.

520
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:03,533
Can I have a sip of your beer?

521
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,699
No. Go.

522
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,003
78, 79, 80.

523
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,104
80.
Okay, what comes after 80?

524
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,540
- 81.
- 81.

525
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,609
Now that's a trail.
You see a trail?

526
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:14,543
Yeah.

527
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,910
But where's the trail lead?

528
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:17,213
The bad guy.

529
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:18,550
To the bad guy.

530
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,186
Now, where's
that bad guy going?

531
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,610
Can we get two more coffees
over here, please?

532
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:24,414
- How was the drive?
- Long.

533
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:27,015
- Long.
- Romantic.

534
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:29,554
Romantic?

535
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,288
He didn't like
my book-on-tape.

536
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:17,901
It's big.

537
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:22,207
Real big.

538
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:28,645
What I want to know is how
much they got in that truck.

539
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:37,253
I'd like to talk to somebody

540
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,823
about opening an IRA.

541
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:05,647
Hi. Can you cash this
for me please?

542
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:06,916
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

543
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,386
- Will that be all?
- Yeah.

544
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:24,399
I see all my friends
buying homes

545
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,934
and doing
these grown up things

546
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:28,773
that shouldn't have seemed
so big to me, but...

547
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,773
when I'd add everything up,

548
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:32,610
it just didn't make
any sense until...

549
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,611
Oh, until now,

550
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:37,178
and everything's
settled down...

551
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:41,016
Sir. Sir, your cash.

552
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:42,484
Oh. Thank you.

553
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:44,055
...they're
in their right place.

554
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:48,792
Oh, I'm a kid. My dad leaves.

555
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:54,662
And when I turned a teenager,
my, uh, mom remarried.

556
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:58,365
And she remarried
to a cop, so...

557
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,035
- A cop?
- Christ, I know.

558
00:33:01,037 --> 00:33:04,605
I'm already doing petty crime
and that type of thing.

559
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,507
Anyway, the first thing
he does is

560
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:09,276
he changes all the locks
on the house.

561
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,880
And, uh, and he writes
a 30-page manifesto

562
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:17,252
about what's gonna happen
now that he's in charge.

563
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:21,390
And things that we have to do,
things we can no longer do,

564
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:22,658
that type of thing.

565
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,226
Well, anyways,
it's Christmastime.

566
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,829
I go out drinking,
I come home late.

567
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:29,497
The house is locked up
like a federal prison.

568
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:30,832
I...

569
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,369
The only window available
to me is a high window,

570
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,303
and I get up
into the high window

571
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,737
and I get halfway through

572
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,340
and I start losing my balance

573
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:40,809
and I'm hanging on
to the Christmas tree.

574
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:45,013
And the balls are falling
and the tinsels are tinseling.

575
00:33:45,015 --> 00:33:46,581
And I see through the tinsel,

576
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:50,186
I see my stepfather
in his whitey-tighties

577
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:52,254
in a combat position

578
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,755
with both hands
on his revolver,

579
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:57,492
and he's ready to squeeze
one off. And he says...

580
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:01,763
"Freeze! Freeze, sailor!"

581
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,332
He's never referred to me
as sailor before.

582
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,368
It was a first.

583
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,040
So I... Things got worse
from there and...

584
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,810
And that's why
I hate Christmas.

585
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,216
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey! It's me.

586
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:22,484
<i>Oh, hello!</i>

587
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:24,386
Is it too late for me to call?

588
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:26,524
<i>No, it's...
it's not that late.</i>

589
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,558
- So, what are you doing?
- <i>Just sitting at home,</i>

590
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,428
<i>paying bills, procrastinating.</i>

591
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,698
- Just waiting for me to call?
- <i>Careful, now.</i>

592
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,234
<i>Where are you anyway?</i>

593
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:42,170
Oh, somewhere in Oklahoma
or Missouri, I don't know.

594
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:43,875
It all seems the same to me.

595
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:48,746
So, you wanna come find me?

596
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:52,948
So, the vault.

597
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,685
- The vault and the truck.
- Hmm.

598
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,620
You really think
we can do it?

599
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:00,656
Yeah, I think
we can probably do it.

600
00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:02,991
We can probably do
anything we set our minds to.

601
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:06,462
I'm just saying, it sounds
like we're showing off.

602
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:08,496
Well, let's show off then.

603
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:10,431
I'm so tired of doing
the same score

604
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,132
over and over again.

605
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:14,169
It's penny-ante bullshit.

606
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:16,304
I'm gonna be 67 years old.

607
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:17,841
My bones hurt.

608
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,978
Jesus Christ.

609
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,882
I'm gonna start thinking
about my future.

610
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,051
My future.

611
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:30,752
What are you thinking,
Forrest?

612
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,856
Do you think
we can pull it off?

613
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:36,093
- Yeah, probably.
- Probably?

614
00:35:37,194 --> 00:35:38,996
Probably?

615
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:41,899
You forget about Paterson?

616
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:44,433
Probably didn't get you
very far then.

617
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,138
Yeah, but that was then.
This is now.

618
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,272
And now,
I know what I'm doing.

619
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,438
Yeah, I know, too.

620
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,843
But I also know
what I'm capable of.

621
00:35:54,578 --> 00:35:57,946
And these days, those are
two different things.

622
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:00,582
I don't have to calm down.

623
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:01,984
No, don't touch me.

624
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,286
I don't want to be cool.

625
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,587
Just...
Would you be quiet?

626
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,223
What is wrong
with my voice?

627
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:09,424
What do I need
to be quiet for?

628
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:12,729
You should take me home.
Your brother is...

629
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:14,862
He tried to grab my boobs!

630
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:16,598
What kind of man
lets his brother

631
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,199
try to touch someone's boobs?

632
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,569
He's 13...

633
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:28,277
<i>...controlled but caused</i>

634
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:31,112
<i>heavy damage to the building
and its contents.</i>

635
00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:32,446
<i>The arson inspectors say</i>

636
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:35,650
<i>there were several points
of instigation for the fire,</i>

637
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,622
<i>and foul play
has not been ruled out.</i>

638
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,922
<i>We now go to Dallas, Texas,</i>

639
00:36:39,924 --> 00:36:42,056
<i>where police from
multiple states have traced</i>

640
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:44,725
<i>a series of dozens
of bank robberies</i>

641
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:47,495
<i>to a band of
highly skilled robbers.</i>

642
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,065
<i>Making this crime spree
even more unusual?</i>

643
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:52,500
<i>These suspects are
a little bit older</i>

644
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,236
<i>than your average criminals.</i>

645
00:36:54,238 --> 00:36:55,804
<i>Well,
we figure them to be about</i>

646
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:57,437
<i>60 to 70 years old.</i>

647
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,775
<i>For that reason, we're calling
them "The Over the Hill Gang."</i>

648
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:01,676
- <i>Good name.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

649
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,178
<i>We came up with that.</i>

650
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,446
<i>Folks from all around,</i>

651
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,681
<i>some from Albuquerque
and Little Rock</i>

652
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:06,781
<i>just putting
our heads together</i>

653
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:08,516
<i>and hoping to nab
these guys.</i>

654
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,984
<i>So, old men robbing banks,</i>

655
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:11,920
<i>it seems like
they'd be fairly conspicuous.</i>

656
00:37:11,922 --> 00:37:14,589
<i>Any idea how they'd gotten
away with it for so long?</i>

657
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:16,058
<i>Well, no.</i>

658
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,725
<i>But frankly, they have
a whole lot more experience</i>

659
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:19,761
<i>robbing banks than we do
catching them.</i>

660
00:37:19,763 --> 00:37:21,228
<i>Think you'll be
the one to catch 'em?</i>

661
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,332
<i>Uh, I think
that any of these fellas here</i>

662
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,766
<i>who put in long hours
and done some real hard work</i>

663
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:27,301
<i>would like to do the job.</i>

664
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:28,904
<i>But, yeah, I won't lie.</i>

665
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:31,007
<i>I'd love to slap the cuffs
on them myself.</i>

666
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:34,743
<i>I hope that happens.
I hope I get the chance.</i>

667
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,111
<i>Here's hoping time
doesn't catch up with them</i>

668
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:37,178
<i>before you do.</i>

669
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,913
- <i>Okay, thank you.</i>
- <i>Thanks, Detective.</i>

670
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:40,951
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>Ted, back to you.</i>

671
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:49,660
Hey, back already?

672
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,362
You see the news?

673
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:55,596
No.

674
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:56,901
How's the weather?

675
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,337
Blue skies.

676
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,819
Hello?

677
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:23,725
You gotta be kidding me.

678
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,775
So, you can take
a look on the tapes.

679
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:42,810
They just sweep right in,
lockstep with the guards.

680
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:44,948
It's like they were escorting
them to the vaults.

681
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:48,285
Detective?

682
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,488
Detective Hunt?
We're this way.

683
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,522
Um. Yeah, so, most people didn't
even know what was going on.

684
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:56,924
- Is this John Hunt?
- Yeah.

685
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:58,960
You're the talk
of the town, Detective.

686
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,295
I gotta get
this straight. Okay.

687
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,998
First, you followed them
into the street, right?

688
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,466
Yes.

689
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,301
And then you fired at them?

690
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,737
Yeah. Like I said, two times.

691
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,170
- Gold?
- Gold.

692
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:11,406
Uh-huh.

693
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:13,007
Well, what do you think
they're gonna do with gold?

694
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:15,143
You tell me. And they'd have
gotten away scot-free

695
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,114
except one of them stopped
to leave this.

696
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,987
That is one hell
of a souvenir.

697
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:28,125
They took off
one of my love handles.

698
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:34,429
You know, I never actually
finished medical school.

699
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:35,763
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

700
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:37,598
Don't tell me that, boy.

701
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,674
<i>We have some breaking news</i>

702
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,143
<i>to tell you about right now.</i>

703
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:51,712
<i>Police are looking
for three suspects</i>

704
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:54,047
<i>who attempted to rob
First Nation's Bank...</i>

705
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,851
How are you doing?

706
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,924
Huh? I'm all right.

707
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:05,096
We almost did it, didn't we?

708
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:08,064
No, we did do it.

709
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:20,009
<i>What are we
looking for here?</i>

710
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,578
Stop right there.
Stop it. Go back.

711
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,781
Wait till the guards go past.

712
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:26,948
No, no. It's there.
It's there.

713
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,783
You're moving forward.
Go back.

714
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:30,585
It's slow motion.
It takes a second.

715
00:40:30,587 --> 00:40:32,120
You got to rewind it.

716
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:33,187
It's rewinding.

717
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:34,790
- You're going forward.
- There you go, see.

718
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:35,857
Come on, man. Just push...

719
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,326
You're not even...
you're pushing...

720
00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:39,361
- It's this one. Stop! Stop!
- Go back to where it was.

721
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:41,730
Don't stop on an empty frame!
Stop on his face.

722
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,434
There! Right there.
Stop right there.

723
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:46,970
Look at that.

724
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,408
Is he smiling?

725
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,341
Must be thinkin' of you.

726
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:58,082
- Detective Hunt?
- Yeah.

727
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:00,150
Those the guys?

728
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:02,949
Yeah.

729
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:06,189
Hmm. Well, we're going
to need those tapes.

730
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:09,089
These tapes are my evidence.

731
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,592
Not any longer they're not.
It's a federal case now.

732
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,995
Thank you very much.

733
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,129
<i>You know,
the Bureau was actually</i>

734
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,297
<i>put together
to catch guys like these.</i>

735
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:18,165
Mm-hmm.

736
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,234
There was Dillinger. Who else?

737
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:22,872
Well, Dillinger and a bunch
of other guys like him.

738
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:25,940
Point is,
you've done your part, John.

739
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,011
You did a good job.

740
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,946
Right.

741
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,647
Hard part's over.

742
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:34,919
Now's the part where
we bring this home.

743
00:41:37,187 --> 00:41:38,322
Mmm.

744
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:41,591
Yeah? That could be.

745
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:44,094
You could bring this home.

746
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,995
Or it could be that
I puzzle things together.

747
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:49,299
I find that clue.

748
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:51,368
I crack the case.

749
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,969
And maybe you come
to me and you say,

750
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,536
"Thanks, John.
Let me shake your hand.

751
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:59,509
"You puzzled things together.
You cracked the case.

752
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,478
That's good work."

753
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,317
You remember something?

754
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,321
Uhh...

755
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:13,224
No.

756
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,891
But they want
the same thing you want.

757
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:20,129
Yeah, that's true.

758
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:23,498
So, why don't they
just let you do it?

759
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,070
They think
that they can do it better.

760
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:28,105
Can they?

761
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:30,574
Probably.

762
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:40,316
Can you get a tire iron, bud?

763
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,884
Maybe it's a good thing.

764
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:45,754
How's it a good thing?

765
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:47,522
Because they aren't
as good as you are.

766
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:48,790
So they won't catch him.

767
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:50,558
Well, thank you, babe.

768
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,926
And if it was your job,

769
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:53,364
you would definitely
catch him.

770
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:56,498
But that's why it's good
that you're not.

771
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,866
Because if you caught him,

772
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,603
you wouldn't get
to chase him anymore.

773
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:04,941
I like how you think.

774
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:30,334
That's that, isn't it?

775
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:34,405
I'll be seeing you boys.

776
00:43:35,272 --> 00:43:36,674
Take care, Teddy.

777
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:43,547
Say, I...

778
00:43:45,147 --> 00:43:48,419
Somethin' I've been meaning
to ask you and, uh...

779
00:43:50,687 --> 00:43:53,656
You got a place across
the street from a cemetery.

780
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:57,792
For a reason?

781
00:43:57,794 --> 00:43:59,393
No.

782
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:00,698
No. Okay.

783
00:44:02,565 --> 00:44:03,634
Okay.

784
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:06,833
You really
never thought about it?

785
00:44:06,835 --> 00:44:08,339
No, not really.

786
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:12,008
Okay. All right.

787
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,243
I'll see you next week.

788
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:20,383
And think
about laying low, okay.

789
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:24,520
- All right.
- Bye, Forrest.

790
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,041
John?

791
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,578
Come on, John.
Don't look so sad, man.

792
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:50,111
We don't need
to waste our time

793
00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:52,382
on a bunch
of old folks anyhow.

794
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:10,300
What's that?

795
00:45:14,138 --> 00:45:15,372
Nothing.

796
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:32,920
You sure
you don't want to try?

797
00:45:32,922 --> 00:45:34,290
Maybe next time.

798
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:36,757
Thought this was
on your list?

799
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:38,227
Oh, it still is.

800
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:42,365
Come on. Come on.

801
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:49,036
- So, do you miss him?
- Oh, sure.

802
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,071
But we got married
when we were young.

803
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:52,373
Like you did.

804
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,079
And then the kids came and...

805
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:59,115
Oh, you could kind of lose
track of yourself, you know.

806
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:02,317
At least I do.

807
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:05,353
And it's so easy to assume
that everything's fine.

808
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:06,920
That this is fine.
This is the way

809
00:46:06,922 --> 00:46:08,091
things are supposed to be.

810
00:46:08,825 --> 00:46:12,192
And so, you spend so much time
thinking you're happy,

811
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:13,627
and then one day you wake up
and you realize,

812
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:16,667
oh, maybe you aren't.

813
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,169
Maybe you never were
in the first place.

814
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,707
Maybe you don't
even know what that means.

815
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:29,611
Then something happens,
like you lose someone or...

816
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:32,647
even your kids grow up
and leave home,

817
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:34,118
and you think...

818
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:37,120
"What do I have left?"

819
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:39,687
So, yeah, I miss him.

820
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:42,522
And there's a part of me
that always will, but...

821
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:46,629
now I think,
now it's okay to be selfish.

822
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:50,098
'Cause you think about...

823
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,866
ten years from now,
where will you be?

824
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:52,969
What'll you be doing?

825
00:46:53,703 --> 00:46:56,337
Now, whenever I close
the door, I think...

826
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,239
"Oh, at least this is
the last time

827
00:46:58,241 --> 00:46:59,973
"I'll ever have
a chance to do

828
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:01,678
whatever that thing was?"

829
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,446
You know what I do
when the door closes?

830
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,681
- What's that?
- I jump out the window.

831
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:11,152
And look, if I ever wonder

832
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:12,420
what I'm doing
or where I'm going,

833
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:14,288
I just think of myself
as that little kid I was

834
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,790
when I was just about
this tall.

835
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,290
And I say, well...

836
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,262
now would he have been
proud of me?

837
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,029
And if the answer is no,

838
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:24,265
well, then I just
keep walking on through.

839
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:27,134
But if the answer is yes,
then I know I'm exactly

840
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,639
where I'm supposed to be.

841
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:34,544
So, is he proud of ya?
That little boy?

842
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:38,379
Oh, he's getting closer
every day.

843
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,649
But you're never exactly where
you're supposed to be, are ya?

844
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,784
I mean, 'cause if you are,
you're dead.

845
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,658
And a little 10-year-old you.
He's...

846
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,228
You know, he might have hopes
and dreams, but...

847
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,965
he doesn't understand time...

848
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,401
or the world like you do.

849
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,270
So...

850
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:06,174
Think you gotta
keep on keeping on.

851
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:09,909
Just living your life.
Trying new things.

852
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:13,549
Just gotta...
keep on pushing.

853
00:48:32,435 --> 00:48:33,837
Uh, ma'am, excuse me.

854
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:36,670
I would like to speak
to the manager.

855
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:39,008
Yes, that's me.
What can I do for you?

856
00:48:40,176 --> 00:48:43,877
Okay, so you want
to take over the mortgage?

857
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,950
I do. I'd like to pay
for it all upfront.

858
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:49,417
Well, that can
certainly be done,

859
00:48:49,419 --> 00:48:52,053
but she would need to come in
and sign over the...

860
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,855
Well, I'd like it
to be a surprise.

861
00:48:53,857 --> 00:48:55,190
Oh, I see.

862
00:48:55,192 --> 00:48:56,824
See, I give you the money...

863
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:59,395
and then she didn't necessarily
have to know about it.

864
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:02,096
Well, that's a heck
of a Christmas present.

865
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,399
So, you have a few options.

866
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,667
One is you could make
a gift to her.

867
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:09,703
The other is
she could come in

868
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:11,138
and sign the property
over to you.

869
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,074
No, no, no.
I don't want to do that.

870
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,641
I just want to pay
for it all

871
00:49:14,643 --> 00:49:16,877
and not have her
necessarily know about it.

872
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:19,048
Well, she'll know
one way or another.

873
00:49:21,216 --> 00:49:23,319
But what if I had
the money here?

874
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:25,786
- Right now?
- Yes.

875
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:28,725
- You have it?
- No, but what if I did?

876
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,125
She'd still need to come in

877
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:32,592
and sign off
on some paperwork.

878
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,560
I see.

879
00:49:33,562 --> 00:49:34,929
I-It would be very easy.

880
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,230
Just a quick bit of paperwork.

881
00:49:36,232 --> 00:49:38,065
Yeah. Just not
right now though.

882
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:39,866
No.

883
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:43,806
Okay, well... thank you.

884
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,919
Thank you.

885
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,223
<i>Is it all right
if I call you Dorothy?</i>

886
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:37,757
<i>Dot.
You can call me Dot.</i>

887
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:39,659
<i>All right. I'm going
to record this conversation</i>

888
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,399
- <i>if that's all right with you.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

889
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,434
So...

890
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,905
why don't you just tell me
what you remember?

891
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,142
Okay. Um...

892
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:55,076
Well...

893
00:50:55,078 --> 00:50:56,310
Wait, I'm sorry.
Hang on a second.

894
00:50:56,312 --> 00:50:57,645
It's okay.

895
00:50:57,647 --> 00:51:00,016
I don't usually do the...

896
00:51:01,283 --> 00:51:02,718
You made it worse.

897
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,725
- There we go. All right. Yup.
- It's okay?

898
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,696
Sorry about that. So, uh...

899
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,763
- Should I start again?
- Yeah.

900
00:51:15,765 --> 00:51:20,234
Okay. Um... Gosh.

901
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:23,904
Well, he and my mom
were only together

902
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:27,208
for two years, so...

903
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,781
I never met him
that I can recall.

904
00:51:32,314 --> 00:51:34,949
By the time I was born,
he was...

905
00:51:34,951 --> 00:51:36,186
already in prison.

906
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,687
My brother says that he...
he thinks

907
00:51:39,689 --> 00:51:41,355
he can remember him
a little bit,

908
00:51:41,357 --> 00:51:45,025
but I don't know
if he really does...

909
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:47,763
or if he just thinks
he does 'cause...

910
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,931
You know how it is.
You hear a story and...

911
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,366
you see a picture
and you kind of put

912
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:54,904
two and two together.

913
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:58,007
And we heard
all kinds of stories.

914
00:51:58,808 --> 00:52:01,574
She told us all kinds
of stories about him.

915
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:05,045
And they didn't really
add up,

916
00:52:05,047 --> 00:52:07,882
but we were just kids, so...

917
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:12,622
He was off sailing
the high seas one year and...

918
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,556
- I think he was off to war...
- Big stories.

919
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:17,824
- Yeah. Exactly.
- All right. Okay.

920
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:20,094
Didn't really make
any difference.

921
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,832
He was just dad and...

922
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:25,200
he was doing stuff and...

923
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:29,172
someday he was gonna
come back and see us.

924
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,573
And then, um...

925
00:52:32,575 --> 00:52:35,942
...I think I was 15 and, uh...

926
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,712
I guess he was
gonna be paroled, so...

927
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:42,886
my mom, she sat us down
and told us the truth.

928
00:52:44,018 --> 00:52:47,656
Just in case he came
looking for us, but...

929
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:50,958
Well, he never did, so...

930
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,393
And so he never called you?
He never wrote?

931
00:52:53,395 --> 00:52:55,228
- Oh, no.
- Mm-hmm.

932
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,066
No. No, he didn't. Uh...

933
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,701
I guess for all I know,
he doesn't know I exist.

934
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:07,475
And he's a grandpa.

935
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:09,710
Yeah, I guess he is.

936
00:53:09,712 --> 00:53:11,982
- What's his name?
- Oh, that's Robbie.

937
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:14,848
Robbie, sweetheart,
you want to say hi?

938
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,085
- No.
- No?

939
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:19,022
- Sorry.
- No, that's all right.

940
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:23,223
I got a boy
just about his age.

941
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:28,698
So, you think
you're gonna catch him?

942
00:53:29,632 --> 00:53:30,931
Well, I hope so.

943
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:32,768
Well, if you do,
I don't wanna see him.

944
00:53:33,701 --> 00:53:34,835
I don't wanna have to come in

945
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,636
and pick him out of...
what's it...

946
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:39,239
a lineup
or whatever it's called, okay.

947
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:40,977
No, that won't be necessary.

948
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:43,947
You know, I think
he should be locked up.

949
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:47,750
You know,
my momma told me that...

950
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:50,217
he always said...

951
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:52,988
"Oh, I'm a changed man now."

952
00:53:54,223 --> 00:53:55,422
And then he would just get out

953
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:57,627
and he'd just do it
all over again.

954
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,296
And again and again.

955
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,130
Even after all that, you know,

956
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,770
she loved him
till the day she died.

957
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:22,585
How about this guy?

958
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:24,752
That's beautiful.

959
00:54:24,754 --> 00:54:26,520
Oh, it's too much money.

960
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:28,321
What about something...

961
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:29,589
How about this one?

962
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:31,025
I love this piece.

963
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,165
- Would you like to try it on?
- I would.

964
00:54:41,036 --> 00:54:42,272
Oh.

965
00:54:44,473 --> 00:54:46,742
Oh. Take your time.

966
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,078
What do you think?

967
00:54:52,614 --> 00:54:54,250
Let's see it
in the light here.

968
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:51,638
Oh, I am so embarrassed!
I just walked right off.

969
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,176
I felt so... I'm so sorry!

970
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:56,375
Would you like me
to help you take it off?

971
00:55:56,377 --> 00:55:58,080
No. Um...

972
00:55:59,248 --> 00:56:00,350
I'll take it.

973
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:05,989
- How much?
- $249.99 with tax.

974
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,533
Yeah, I held on
to all of this stuff.

975
00:56:19,535 --> 00:56:21,768
Back when I represented him...

976
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,138
I thought maybe I'd write
a book or something like that

977
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,341
or maybe even just tell
my grandkids about it.

978
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,777
It's such a great story.

979
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:37,786
Is that the man
you're looking for?

980
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,654
Yeah, I do believe it is.

981
00:56:40,656 --> 00:56:41,855
Man, I remember
Forrest Tucker.

982
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,359
He was the real deal.

983
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,462
Holy smokes.

984
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:49,895
Age 13, bicycle theft.

985
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:51,300
That's getting an early start.

986
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,902
He spent
his whole life locked up.

987
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:57,337
Except for the times
that he broke out.

988
00:56:57,339 --> 00:57:00,473
Sixteen successful escapes.

989
00:57:00,475 --> 00:57:01,808
- Sixteen?
- Uh-huh.

990
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,643
That's some kind
of record, right?

991
00:57:03,645 --> 00:57:09,118
A few years back, he broke out
of San Quentin in a boat...

992
00:57:09,986 --> 00:57:12,286
he built out
of scrap wood and tarp

993
00:57:12,288 --> 00:57:14,154
and who knows what else.

994
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:16,623
Painted the Marin County logo
on the side

995
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,460
and sailed
right on out of there.

996
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,096
You ever meet him,
he'll tell you all about it.

997
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:25,299
He'll tell you every detail
of every adventure he ever had.

998
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:26,933
And probably a few
that he didn't.

999
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:28,034
Maybe somebody
should have told him

1000
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:29,506
to quit while he was ahead.

1001
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:32,408
Well, you find something
you love.

1002
00:57:33,276 --> 00:57:36,143
<i>I got put on his case when
he got caught in Montana</i>

1003
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:38,679
<i>a few years back.</i>

1004
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,346
There was a chase...

1005
00:57:40,348 --> 00:57:44,153
which I learned
was not unusual at all.

1006
00:57:45,154 --> 00:57:46,819
Well, when they got
to the showdown,

1007
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:49,457
the cops said
that he fired on them.

1008
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:53,761
But he claimed that, uh,
he didn't even have a gun.

1009
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:56,163
That it was just
his car backfiring.

1010
00:57:56,165 --> 00:57:58,301
I expect
that's probably half true.

1011
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,067
He did always have
a gun on him,

1012
00:58:01,069 --> 00:58:03,971
but if you told me that
he had never fired that thing

1013
00:58:03,973 --> 00:58:06,075
once in his life,
I'd believe ya.

1014
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,109
I remember
I sat down with him once

1015
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,513
and I said, "Forrest...

1016
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:15,016
"surely there's an easier way

1017
00:58:15,018 --> 00:58:17,884
for somebody in your position
to make a living."

1018
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:20,254
And he looked at me
and he said, "Brother...

1019
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:22,926
"I'm not talking about
making a living.

1020
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,929
I'm just talking
about living."

1021
00:59:08,437 --> 00:59:10,939
<i>Keep your
hands where I can see 'em!</i>

1022
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,643
<i>Better not be crossed.</i>

1023
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:02,317
Hi, baby.

1024
01:01:03,319 --> 01:01:04,286
Hi.

1025
01:01:05,853 --> 01:01:07,721
Did you find him?

1026
01:01:07,723 --> 01:01:09,325
Yeah, sorta.

1027
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:11,627
What's that mean?

1028
01:01:13,562 --> 01:01:14,764
Well...

1029
01:01:15,763 --> 01:01:18,230
I figured out who he is.

1030
01:01:18,232 --> 01:01:19,267
And?

1031
01:01:22,872 --> 01:01:25,672
He's a guy who is old...

1032
01:01:25,674 --> 01:01:27,142
but used to be young.

1033
01:01:29,044 --> 01:01:32,347
And he just loves
robbing banks.

1034
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,285
- That's it?
- That's it.

1035
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,254
Just like you're a guy
who's a cop...

1036
01:01:41,256 --> 01:01:42,724
who's gonna catch him.

1037
01:01:50,598 --> 01:01:53,502
Yeah. Something like that.

1038
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:00,841
It's late.

1039
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,379
- It's not that late, baby.
- The kids are asleep.

1040
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:08,051
How asleep are they?

1041
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:11,752
Oh, my goodness.

1042
01:02:11,754 --> 01:02:13,821
- Come on. Let's go out.
- What?

1043
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:15,288
Let's go out.
Let's get a babysitter.

1044
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,089
I have to work in the morning.

1045
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:18,760
- So what?
- What?

1046
01:02:22,064 --> 01:02:24,297
- What is going on with you?
- I don't know.

1047
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,937
Wait, shouldn't you be
calling somebody?

1048
01:02:29,939 --> 01:02:31,837
But shouldn't... No.
Telling who?

1049
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,105
That you found him?

1050
01:02:33,107 --> 01:02:35,375
Tell who? Tell them?
I'm not telling anybody.

1051
01:02:36,978 --> 01:02:38,647
Tonight he's all mine.

1052
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:24,493
Hey.

1053
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,560
Yeah.

1054
01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:29,462
You really just
drifted off into outer space.

1055
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,900
Yeah. Hey, you wanna
get out of here?

1056
01:03:33,902 --> 01:03:35,234
Oh, we just ordered pie.

1057
01:03:35,236 --> 01:03:36,335
No, I mean
really get out of here.

1058
01:03:36,337 --> 01:03:37,739
Like take a trip somewhere.

1059
01:03:39,174 --> 01:03:41,677
- Like a vacation?
- Yeah.

1060
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:45,411
Oh. I don't know, I...

1061
01:03:45,413 --> 01:03:47,681
You know, I've got the animals
to take care of and...

1062
01:03:47,683 --> 01:03:50,219
Yeah, but say that wasn't
a problem. Would you want to?

1063
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,620
Maybe.

1064
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:54,623
Okay.

1065
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:20,682
Hey!

1066
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,586
Didn't I see you on TV?

1067
01:04:31,893 --> 01:04:33,326
- Oh, maybe.
- No, I think so.

1068
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,426
You were involved in that...
What were you call...

1069
01:04:34,428 --> 01:04:35,931
The Over The Hill Gang, right?

1070
01:04:37,065 --> 01:04:38,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1071
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,435
Did you catch them?

1072
01:04:42,703 --> 01:04:43,837
Not yet.

1073
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,875
Hmm. You close?

1074
01:04:46,908 --> 01:04:48,210
Oh, we're getting there.

1075
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,911
Excuse me. I don't want
to be rude here, but...

1076
01:04:51,913 --> 01:04:53,513
straighten this out
a little bit.

1077
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:56,350
I was forced to learn how
to do this in Catholic school.

1078
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:58,054
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1079
01:04:58,955 --> 01:05:01,824
There you go. Looking sharp.
You got a gal with you?

1080
01:05:02,924 --> 01:05:04,524
I got my wife with me, yeah.

1081
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,326
Oh, this is great.

1082
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:08,060
It's been my experience
that looking sharp

1083
01:05:08,062 --> 01:05:09,328
will take you a long,
long way.

1084
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,966
Make you look like you know
what you're doing.

1085
01:05:11,933 --> 01:05:13,236
Even if you don't.

1086
01:05:17,772 --> 01:05:18,841
Forrest?

1087
01:05:23,245 --> 01:05:24,680
I know what I'm doing.

1088
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:07,516
Goodnight.

1089
01:09:53,782 --> 01:09:55,615
<i>Forrest Tucker,
you are under arrest.</i>

1090
01:09:55,617 --> 01:09:57,249
<i>Step away from the car!</i>

1091
01:09:57,251 --> 01:10:00,154
<i>Put your hands up and
step away from the car now!</i>

1092
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,092
<i>Don't do it!
Get out of the car!</i>

1093
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,209
<i>Two cars south bound on...</i>

1094
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,848
<i>FS-522 going south bound...</i>

1095
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:31,613
Please.

1096
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,184
Please. My boy.

1097
01:11:46,694 --> 01:11:47,694
Okay.

1098
01:11:47,696 --> 01:11:48,928
Pull over here.

1099
01:13:52,953 --> 01:13:54,288
Is he okay?

1100
01:13:56,157 --> 01:13:57,192
Mm-hmm.

1101
01:13:58,493 --> 01:13:59,928
I understand.

1102
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,466
Okay, well.
Hey, thanks for calling.

1103
01:14:07,102 --> 01:14:08,634
All right.

1104
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:21,948
What happened?

1105
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,285
Well, they caught him.

1106
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:26,421
- They did?
- Yeah.

1107
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,892
- Yup.
- How?

1108
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:34,897
Oh, somebody talked.

1109
01:14:36,364 --> 01:14:37,866
Hmm.

1110
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,135
Now what?

1111
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,006
He'll go to prison.

1112
01:14:44,872 --> 01:14:46,140
Hmm.

1113
01:14:47,408 --> 01:14:48,876
That's too bad.

1114
01:14:50,577 --> 01:14:52,046
Yeah, I guess so.

1115
01:14:56,518 --> 01:14:58,554
I'm sorry
you didn't catch him.

1116
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:06,060
I'm not.

1117
01:15:22,609 --> 01:15:25,779
<i>The Over
the Hill Gang is no more.</i>

1118
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:28,147
<i>Last night,
federal agents in Fort Worth</i>

1119
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,016
<i>arrested the leader
of the group,</i>

1120
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:33,552
<i>74-year-old
Forrest Silver Tucker.</i>

1121
01:15:33,554 --> 01:15:35,286
<i>Tucker, a native of Florida,</i>

1122
01:15:35,288 --> 01:15:38,022
<i>is best remembered in the
Bay area for engineering...</i>

1123
01:15:38,024 --> 01:15:39,491
<i>...one of the most</i>

1124
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,793
<i>innovative prison breaks
in San Quentin history.</i>

1125
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:44,097
<i>That is just one
of a long list of escapes</i>

1126
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:46,833
<i>and an even longer list
of crimes.</i>

1127
01:16:08,688 --> 01:16:11,091
<i>But after
a few years on the lam,</i>

1128
01:16:11,093 --> 01:16:13,959
<i>time has officially caught up
with this career criminal.</i>

1129
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:17,195
<i>Also arrested,
fellow convict Teddy Green</i>

1130
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,266
<i>whom Tucker met
in San Quentin.</i>

1131
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:22,035
<i>A third member of the gang
is still at large,</i>

1132
01:16:22,037 --> 01:16:24,271
<i>but for the time being,
police say</i>

1133
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:27,576
<i>The Over the Hill Gang
is officially retired.</i>

1134
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:01,209
Forrest Tucker,
you got a visitor.

1135
01:17:09,983 --> 01:17:12,254
You lied to me
about your name.

1136
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,589
Well, I figured you knew.

1137
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:20,261
That's what the detectives
asked me, if I knew.

1138
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:26,400
If I even had
the slightest idea.

1139
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:30,471
- Hmm, what'd you say?
- Said of course not.

1140
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:35,607
I'm sorry.

1141
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,679
Well, me too.

1142
01:17:44,051 --> 01:17:46,188
Here. I wrote something
for you.

1143
01:17:54,696 --> 01:17:56,061
What's this?

1144
01:17:56,063 --> 01:17:58,499
These are all the times
I broke out before.

1145
01:19:43,304 --> 01:19:44,469
You coming, Forrest?

1146
01:19:44,471 --> 01:19:45,905
Oh, I'm gonna finish up here.

1147
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:47,309
I'll be with you in a minute.

1148
01:19:48,608 --> 01:19:49,743
Okay.

1149
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:43,831
What about this one?

1150
01:20:44,931 --> 01:20:45,934
Well...

1151
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:49,336
kinda saving
the best for last.

1152
01:20:52,206 --> 01:20:53,440
Well...

1153
01:20:54,774 --> 01:20:55,844
maybe, uh...

1154
01:20:57,077 --> 01:20:59,247
maybe you should
just stay put.

1155
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:21,962
Mudroom's right across
the hall if you need anything.

1156
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:24,933
Okay.

1157
01:22:27,469 --> 01:22:29,837
You can stay
as long as you want to.

1158
01:22:32,206 --> 01:22:33,440
Thanks.

1159
01:22:37,444 --> 01:22:39,046
I'm glad you called.

1160
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,019
Well, I'm glad you picked up.

1161
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:14,549
<i>Then we'll go on.</i>

1162
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:17,551
<i>Doesn't matter where.</i>

1163
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,322
<i>Maybe we'll run over
to Arizona.</i>

1164
01:23:21,255 --> 01:23:22,589
<i>The roads are straight.</i>

1165
01:23:23,523 --> 01:23:24,892
<i>And we'll build a house.</i>

1166
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,962
<i>Yeah, we'll build a house.</i>

1167
01:23:29,529 --> 01:23:31,899
<i>Because if I'm not grounded
pretty soon...</i>

1168
01:23:33,099 --> 01:23:34,669
<i>I'm going to go into orbit.</i>

1169
01:24:33,059 --> 01:24:34,428
Jewel, wake up.

1170
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,797
I need to go out for a bit.
Do you need anything?

1171
01:24:38,799 --> 01:24:43,438
No. How long
you gonna be gone?

1172
01:24:44,304 --> 01:24:45,640
Not long.

1173
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,068
Hello?

1174
01:25:15,803 --> 01:25:16,735
Hello?

1175
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:17,939
<i>Hey, John.</i>

1176
01:25:19,172 --> 01:25:20,675
Yeah, it is.

1177
01:25:23,376 --> 01:25:25,513
- Who's this?
- <i>How's it going?</i>

1178
01:25:27,514 --> 01:25:28,816
Forrest Tucker.

1179
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:31,883
Is that you?

1180
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:35,154
- <i>I heard you got out.</i>
- Yeah, I got out all right.

1181
01:25:35,156 --> 01:25:38,490
What happened? Did you
get tired of digging tunnels

1182
01:25:38,492 --> 01:25:40,194
and climbing fences?

1183
01:25:41,394 --> 01:25:43,764
<i>Well, I thought so, but, uh...</i>

1184
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,868
<i>Forrest?</i>

1185
01:25:49,336 --> 01:25:51,337
<i>Forrest, are you all right?</i>

1186
01:25:51,339 --> 01:25:53,675
Yeah, I... I'm about to be.
