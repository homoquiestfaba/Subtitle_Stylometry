Radio announcer: <i>Good morning. It's
time for the peninsula report.</i>

12
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,908
<i>After three weeks, the murder</i>

<i>Coroners say the victim</i>

18
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,819
Forced to drink bleach,
window cleaner.

19
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,388
<i>The investigation</i>

<i>Mary, breakfast is ready!</i>

22
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,312
<i>Come on!</i>

23
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,586
Mary, can you see my butt?

24
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,957
- I can smell it.
- Shut up.

25
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,328
Can I speak with you?

26
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,567
Boy:<i> Busted.</i>

27
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,604
- What are these?
- I don't know.

28
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,805
Don't tell me you don't know.

29
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,906
You know what these are.

30
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,708
What are they doing
in this house?

31
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,310
I don't know.
Where'd you find them?

32
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,811
It doesn't matter
where I found them,

33
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,482
<i>does it? The point</i>
<i>is I found them.</i>

34
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,916
<i>Are they yours?</i>

35
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,818
- They're not...
- Tell me. Are they yours?

36
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,687
- No, they're not mine.
- Mom, mom, mom.

37
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,789
They're mine. I mean...
I mean, they're Liz's.

38
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,725
I was holding them so she
wouldn't get in trouble.

39
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,031
It's okay.

40
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,776
We are gonna talk
about this later...

41
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,444
shut up, little miss perfect.

42
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,406
Girl: <i>What's up?</i>

43
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,957
The question is why?
Why did he kill her?

44
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,859
Didn't you hear me honking
for you last night?

45
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,994
I met some guys at the park.

46
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,963
You know, maybe she represented

47
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,432
some kind of threatening female
figure, you know, like mom...

48
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,801
one of them asked me to the
exchange dance next Friday.

49
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,138
I bet it was one of those sick guys who
totally got molested by his father.

50
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,673
- Mary.
- It's so classic.

51
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,007
- It always happens.
- Would you shut up?

52
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,542
Stop talking about Kathleen

53
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,844
like she's some kind
of statistic.

54
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,946
- I wasn't.
- <i> Yes, you were.</i>

55
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,614
<i>This isn't in a magazine.</i>

56
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,550
It's real.
Margie's little sister is dead.

57
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,919
The guy could still be around.
It's creepy.

58
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,092
Let me set you up
next Friday for the dance.

59
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,602
Do you think I'm,
like, the butt-ugliest?

60
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,137
No, of course not.

61
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,872
Then why have I
never had a date?

62
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,940
Because every time
you meet a guy,

63
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,077
you start talking about the five
different kinds of head wounds.

64
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,449
The virgin Mary

65
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,919
is not only pure,
but immaculate.

66
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,555
<i>Not only virtuous,</i>

67
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,057
but innocence itself.

68
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,959
<i>She is sacred,</i>

69
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,595
<i>completely untainted by sin.</i>

70
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,669
Mary giordano.

71
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,970
Yes, sister?

72
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,908
Please recite
the hierarchy of values.

73
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,044
Um...

74
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,723
It's so nice
to have you back, Margie.

75
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,193
Your sister has been
in our prayers.

76
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,861
Thank you.

77
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,103
We were about to hear
the hierarchy of values.

78
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:57,642
Supernatural, spiritual,
intellectual, material.

79
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,178
Tell us in your own words

80
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,514
the hierarchy's significance.

81
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:06,184
Well, it's kind of
like a structure,

82
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,253
<i>a way of looking at things.</i>

83
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,189
It's kind of like God
gave us this plan,

84
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,958
and if we have faith in it

85
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
and follow its rules,
he'll protect us.

86
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,962
<i>In God's world,</i>

87
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,864
there's a reason
for everything.

88
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,767
Nun: <i>Yes, Margie?</i>

89
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,973
<i>Margie?</i>

90
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,760
Hey.

91
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,996
- Hey, new cadets?
- Well, I hope so.

92
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,198
We're about to give them guns.

93
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,966
You want one?

94
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,569
Nah. I got to get
in shape for my exam.

95
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,070
- Ah.
- Is g-man here?

96
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,706
- Yeah, he's in his cell.
- Great.

97
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,876
But, Mary, I wouldn't go back
there if I were you! Mary!

98
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,680
Man:<i> Yeah?</i>

99
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,553
Shit.

100
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,064
Don't you have piano lessons
or something?

101
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,935
Tell me what you have
on the donlevy case.

102
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,871
Didn't I help you write the
paper on Jeffrey dahmer?

103
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,773
- Yeah.
- Didn't I help you

104
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,174
build a model of San Quentin

105
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,776
for your California
history class?

106
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,277
Yeah.

107
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,313
Then get the hell out.

108
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,182
Dad would have
wanted you to help me.

109
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,284
Your dad was killed
in the line of duty.

110
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,920
He'd want you to have
a nice, safe desk job.

111
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,990
You know I'd be a good cop.

112
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,826
You want to know
what police work is?

113
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,696
Most of the time you sit on
your ass writing reports.

114
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,365
The rest of the time, you spend
with the scum of the earth.

115
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,233
People are basically good.
They just...

116
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,235
they're good and bad.

117
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,004
You better keep your eyes open,

118
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,606
or you're going
to get in trouble.

119
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,341
Believe me. I know my business.

120
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,876
Really?

121
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,145
Is that why Kathleen's
killer is behind bars?

122
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,150
Now you listen to me,
you little shit.

123
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,319
This freak
made her drink bleach,

124
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,689
window cleaner, and chopped her up.
He's still out there.

125
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,226
So the last thing I need is for
some snot-nosed junior miss

126
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,095
coming in here
giving me advice!

127
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,732
But didn't you say
that a detective's job

128
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,868
is to step into the victim's
shoes and walk backwards?

129
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,170
That's right.

130
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,741
So unless you've stepped in miss
donlevy's shoes yourself...

131
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,411
So I'm like, "how do you know?"

132
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,051
Go! Go!

133
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,952
<i>Are you serious?</i>

134
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,388
He took off my top,
then my underwear.

135
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>No way.</i>

136
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,991
Then he took off his pants.

137
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,326
<i>What did you do?</i>

138
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,347
Woman:<i> 13 more.</i>

139
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,732
So who's your boyfriends?

140
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,233
Don't you guys have boyfriends?

141
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,368
<i>She sort of does.</i>

142
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,970
You have a boyfriend?

143
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,839
- Yeah.
- A little young.

144
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,174
Girl: <i>That's what I told her.</i>

145
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:27,045
Man:<i> You girls really
shouldn't talk to strangers.</i>

146
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,154
He's so cute.

147
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,522
Do you know that guy?

148
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,425
Sure. He's been hanging
around here a lot.

149
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,409
Child:<i> Hey!</i>

150
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,845
Barker:
<i>50 cents to crack the whip!</i>

151
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,381
<i>Only three balls, a chance</i>
<i>to win the big prize.</i>

152
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,573
<i>Have a nice weekend.</i>

153
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,376
<i>Remember, graduation rehearsal</i>

154
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,444
<i>will be at 2:00 P.M.</i>
<i>next Friday.</i>

155
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,238
God, what is wrong with you?

156
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,507
Radio host:
<i>Let me ask you this, Jay.</i>

157
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,177
<i>Do you ever feel</i>
<i>any remorse after you kill?</i>

158
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,180
Jay:<i> Remorse?</i>
<i>Why should I feel remorse?</i>

159
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,449
<i>Okay. Why don't</i>
<i>we go to the phones?</i>

160
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,051
<i>Line three, you're on the air.</i>

161
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,220
I need you to go
to the mini mart for me.

162
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,322
Well, can't John go?

163
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,257
He's at Jason's,
and Vicky's at the mall.

164
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,658
I just need a few things.

165
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,260
It will only take you a minute.

166
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,769
Mary: Damn it.

167
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,792
Man: <i>Sir, I'm sorry. We are out.</i>

168
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,338
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

169
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,611
Oh, my eyes!

170
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,480
Man: <i>What the hell is
going on out here?</i>

171
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,416
I can't see!

172
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,121
How was I supposed
to know he was a cop?

173
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,592
Tony Campbell, a new cadet.

174
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,828
Highest test scores
in his class.

175
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,497
I'm blind.

176
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,398
Why were you following me?

177
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,401
I saw you here at the station.

178
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,537
I thought you were one of
donlevy's girlfriends.

179
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,240
<i>I thought you might</i>
<i>lead me to something.</i>

180
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,510
I ought to kick
both of you in the ass.

181
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,881
You know it's against
regulations for a cadet

182
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,883
<i>to be investigating anything.</i>

183
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,484
That's why you
don't have access

184
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,319
to files or any kind
of information.

185
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,756
And, you, I'm citing you

186
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,158
for using unregistered mace.

187
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,859
And the next time that you want

188
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,461
to dream up some espionage,

189
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,163
I'm calling your mother.

190
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,767
You messed him up,
you take him home.

191
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,240
What do you care
about Kathleen, anyway?

192
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,443
No way I'm waiting 10
years to make detective.

193
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,345
You know, this case
is very similar

194
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,847
to one that happened
two years ago in...

195
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,849
Utah? I know.

196
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,450
Tammy ryder.

197
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,453
Teenage girl disappears
into thin air,

198
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,923
body parts scattered
all over the place.

199
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,325
Police found nothing.

200
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,194
Searched the car,
clothes, house.

201
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,962
Not even a flake of skin

202
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,564
to track the guy through DNA.

203
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,232
How do you know all that?

204
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,605
Are you really trying
to find Kathleen's killer?

205
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,907
<i>I mean, 'cause if you are,</i>

206
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,509
<i>as a cadet, you do have access</i>

207
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,677
to all the computers.

208
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,278
I mean, we could track down

209
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,313
any suspect we got
through Washington.

210
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,581
With more than one person,

211
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,949
we could cover
twice as much ground,

212
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:18,950
- interview twice...
- <i> Whoa, whoa.</i>

213
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,551
Wait a minute.

214
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,553
Why are you after this guy?

215
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,756
She could have been me.

216
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,727
I'm not into babysitting.

217
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,366
No! No, that's a foul!

218
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,335
That is a stupid foul!
You idiot!

219
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,736
You are so stupid!

220
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,338
Is guinn in?

221
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,373
They tell me to bet
against the clippers

222
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,674
'cause they can't win a game,

223
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,343
and now I've lost
50 bucks. Gosh.

224
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,744
Is guinn in?

225
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,512
You know it's his day off.

226
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,914
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

227
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,949
But I left something in
his office the other day,

228
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,352
- and I want to go get it.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

229
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,527
<i>Come on!</i>

230
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,652
Kathleen.

231
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,352
<i>...0800, please report</i>

232
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,688
<i>to the kit room</i>
<i>at the end of the shift.</i>

233
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,023
- <i> Repeat, three...</i>
- Officer:<i> He said that?</i>

234
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,692
No way.

235
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,393
- <i> Amazing.</i>
- <i> Yeah, I know.</i>

236
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,961
Hey, Sherlock.

237
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,964
<i>Come on, man. Hey, Tony.</i>

238
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,499
<i>Hurry up!</i>

239
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:23,641
Okay, I'm sorry about
the babysitting comment.

240
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,445
If it's good enough,
we could work together.

241
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,024
Please?

242
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,795
Come on.

243
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,603
Looks like an employee list

244
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,004
of the carnival. Big deal.

245
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,374
She was seen somewhere later.

246
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,109
What?

247
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,878
At the mini mart.

248
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,719
- Let me handle this.
- Why?

249
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,488
Because you got to break
into the records room.

250
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,922
Now it's my turn.

251
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,495
We're with
the police department.

252
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,896
Like to ask you
a few questions.

253
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,766
I already told
you guys everything.

254
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,968
Well, we'd like
to hear it again.

255
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,972
Were you working the night
the donlevy girl came in?

256
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,442
- Yeah.
- Can you describe the events of that night

257
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,977
and your contact
with miss donlevy?

258
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,681
You guys ain't cops.

259
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,751
Excuse me.

260
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,187
Excuse me.

261
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,927
Ow! Shit! Okay!

262
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,629
<i>She came in about 12:30</i>

263
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,464
<i>and picked up some</i>
<i>cleanser or something.</i>

264
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,032
She stood around
like she expected me

265
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,034
to say something,
and then she left.

266
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,536
Was anyone with her?

267
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,538
Clerk:<i> No!</i>

268
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,772
Ow!

269
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,774
<i>Ow! Ow. Don't...</i>

270
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,745
wait. There was a blue car
in the parking lot.

271
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,147
<i>I looked up later,</i>
<i>and it was gone.</i>

272
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,654
Thanks for your cooperation.

273
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,127
I can't believe
you just did that.

274
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,728
He wasn't going
to tell us anything.

275
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,130
You didn't have to hurt him.

276
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,731
It jogged his memory,
didn't it?

277
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,133
It was illegal.

278
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,968
Hey, what do you think
being a cop is, Mary?

279
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,871
You walk in, offer you a
donut, and spill their guts?

280
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,606
This is the real world.
People get hurt,

281
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,042
bleed, die.

282
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,643
He could go to the police.

283
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,812
He won't. He's got four b&es

284
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,815
and a fear of going
back to county.

285
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,218
Look, if we're going to work
together, you got to trust me.

286
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,986
Why should I?

287
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,789
Because you lived your whole
life in a suburban bubble.

288
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,225
I've seen the world for the
shithole it really is.

289
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,142
You think I'm naive.

290
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,847
I'm sorry.

291
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,516
I didn't mean to scare you.

292
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,956
You really think
the world's that bad?

293
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,126
My dad gave me a bad attitude.

294
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:35,566
When I was growing up,
he wanted me to be a diver.

295
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,569
Only one thing he never
took into consideration,

296
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,738
I'm afraid of heights.

297
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,044
I remember one time

298
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,313
they made me
go off the high dive.

299
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:55,286
Everyone was screaming
for me to go,

300
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:58,122
and I just
stood there petrified.

301
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,560
Tough cop, huh?

302
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,009
I got to go. I got to study.

303
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,461
Radio: <i>Only two short
blocks from central Avenue.</i>

304
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,430
<i>This fun-filled extravaganza</i>

305
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,398
<i>of rides and games</i>

306
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,434
<i>and your family into a spin.</i>

307
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,903
<i>Carnival magic</i>
<i>is in your neighborhood.</i>

308
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:28,238
<i>It's the final week</i>
<i>of a month of fun,</i>

309
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,908
<i>so be sure</i>
<i>and catch carnival magic.</i>

310
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,843
<i>It's brought thrills</i>
<i>to boys and girls</i>

311
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,079
<i>up and down the west coast.</i>

312
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,021
"Up and down the west coast."

313
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,390
Hmm.

314
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,166
Man:<i> Hey, you want the
tilt-a wheel tonight?</i>

315
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,001
- Hi.
- Man:<i> On it!</i>

316
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,104
Do you know where
the main office is?

317
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,739
<i>Right over there.</i>

318
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,407
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,871
Hi.

320
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm writing an article
for my high school paper

321
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,309
on modern-day
traveling carnivals,

322
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,012
and I was wondering...

323
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:45,082
Could you tell me what cities
you've been to in the past year?

324
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,958
Yes.

325
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,927
John:<i> No.</i>

326
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,465
I'll do your dishes
for a month.

327
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah, last time, I think I got

328
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,169
about 50 hours
community service.

329
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,037
Uh-uh.

330
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,475
John!

331
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,046
All right. 100 bucks.

332
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,283
I can't get 100 bucks.

333
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:22,252
It's easy. You just take
it from mom's stash,

334
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,087
replace it with money
from your savings.

335
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,989
I'm not going
to steal from mom.

336
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,901
Okay.

337
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,002
Yeah?

338
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,006
Okay.

339
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,390
You know, if mom snakes you
doing this, you're dead meat.

340
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,526
Yeah, yeah, I know. Go. Do it.

341
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,886
These carnival employees,

342
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,922
I need to know what kinds
of cars they drive.

343
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,332
No blue cars.

344
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:49,573
Cars seen near
unsolved murder sites.

345
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,984
Okay.

346
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,487
<i>Colt, tercel,</i>

347
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,956
<i>corolla, Malibu, karman ghia.</i>

348
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,961
No. No. No.

349
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,434
No. No.

350
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,141
Colt. Corolla.

351
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,677
<i>Tercel. Karmann ghia.</i>

352
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,445
<i>My God.</i>

353
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,482
Earl parkins.

354
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,055
Hello.

355
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:41,158
We have a suspect.

356
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,067
Hi. I'm almost ready.

357
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,134
Come on in.

358
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,471
That's okay.
I'll just wait out here.

359
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,508
Whatever.

360
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,331
Man: <i>The ring toss.</i>

361
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,733
<i>Come win,</i>
<i>and play the ring toss.</i>

362
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,334
- Let's go, dad.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

363
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,270
Jesus. His hand is messed up.

364
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,773
Mary: <i>Looks like it's deformed.</i>

365
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:32,275
The only wild card
is that blue Malibu

366
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,278
- suspected in Washington.
- Tony:<i> Hmm.</i>

367
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,582
- <i> Wonder why the cops didn't catch the pattern?</i>
- <i> They weren't looking for it.</i>

368
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,684
As far as they're concerned,
these are separate murders.

369
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,285
The m.O.S are different.

370
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,021
<i>They happened</i>
<i>in different cities.</i>

371
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,559
Barker: <i>We've got a winner</i>

372
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,629
<i>on horse number three.</i>
<i>Horse number three.</i>

373
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,802
What about the carnival, though?
It's an obvious link.

374
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,670
Maybe not all the victims
went to the carnival.

375
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,539
I mean, why would
the cops know about it

376
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,241
if there was nothing
to lead them there?

377
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,143
<i>The only reason I thought of it</i>

378
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:07,477
<i>was 'cause I heard</i>
<i>the radio commercial</i>

379
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,246
and remembered some
of the west coast murders

380
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,547
in "true crimes'"
unsolved file.

381
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,417
The victims were
all teenage girls.

382
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,455
If he did it, I wonder why.

383
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:22,426
Maybe 'cause he's
a freaking maniac.

384
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,327
Murder is
a desperate cry for help,

385
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,729
someone reaching out.

386
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,798
If you can figure out why
someone does something,

387
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,832
you can help them.

388
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,301
- Really?
- Yeah.

389
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,502
Bang.

390
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,204
A woman's walking
down a street.

391
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,739
A bullet hits her head.

392
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,308
Bang. A plane crashes
into a Mountain,

393
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,544
300 people dead.

394
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:43,213
Bang. Baby gets leukemia,

395
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,182
<i>dies at age three.</i>

396
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,650
What's your point?

397
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,853
The world is chaotic.

398
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,721
Sometimes there are no reasons.

399
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,356
You're wrong.

400
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,094
You seriously think
he wants to get caught?

401
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,664
Come on.

402
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,735
Tony: <i>No way am I going
up on that thing.</i>

403
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,337
<i>Oh, yeah. Afraid of heights.</i>

404
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,306
Well, keep an eye on me.

405
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,707
I got to check
something out, okay?

406
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,142
Hey. Hey.

407
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,543
Mary.

408
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,320
Going solo, huh?

409
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,530
Have a nice ride.

410
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,452
Mary: <i>Where's he going?</i>

411
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,922
Only one way to find out.

412
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,806
- Oh, my God.
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

413
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,889
Mary: <i>He's going to kill her.</i>

414
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,391
Tony: <i>If anything
happens, I'll break in.</i>

415
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,930
Woman: Wait a second.
Tell you what.

416
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,832
- <i> Tell you what...</i>
- <i> What?</i>

417
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,334
I don't feel like anything.

418
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,421
Mary: <i>Follow him. Follow him.</i>

419
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,690
Get her plate number first.

420
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,362
Two...

421
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,644
You have fun today, Roxanne?

422
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,513
I did.

423
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,652
Mary: Maybe he's
playing some kind

424
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,087
of waiting game, you know?

425
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,328
Piece of crap.

426
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,363
- What's your poison?
- Huh?

427
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,764
Drink. I'm having a beer.

428
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,600
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

429
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,069
Make yourself comfortable.

430
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,921
Have a seat.

431
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,589
Thanks.

432
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,627
Cheers.

433
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,062
Cheers.

434
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,504
Big drinker, huh?

435
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,789
Blue Malibu.

436
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,724
The blue Malibu.

437
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,826
Where the hell
is the blue Malibu?

438
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,828
Well, let's take
into consideration

439
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,164
the kid at the mini mart
could be full of shit.

440
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,066
True.

441
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,069
All right, so here's
the plan for tomorrow.

442
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,872
After class,
I'll keep an eye on Earl.

443
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,673
You track down that girl.

444
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,543
Okay.

445
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,113
What's that?

446
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,715
Um...

447
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,884
They're just family photos.

448
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,685
- Family photos?
- Yeah.

449
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,921
I've never seen
anyone so nervous

450
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,424
- <i> about family photos.</i>
- They're just...

451
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,792
Just what?

452
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,460
Oh...

453
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,676
when'd you take these?

454
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,746
When I followed you.

455
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,051
Come here.

456
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,631
There's fingerprints on 'em.

457
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,804
Did you look at them?

458
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:34,224
We can't do this.
We can't do this.

459
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:39,796
Mary.

460
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,731
Mary!

461
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,106
You're just a kid.

462
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,077
I know I'm not pretty.

463
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,282
You're beautiful.

464
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:09,559
You're beautiful.

465
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,300
I don't want to scare you.

466
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,102
I'm not afraid.

467
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,198
Mrs. Giordano: <i>She was
out till 3:00 A.M.,</i>

468
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,799
<i>wouldn't tell me anything.</i>

469
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,668
Guinn: <i>I'll take care of it.</i>

470
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,142
Where the hell
were you last night?

471
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,276
What?

472
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,679
Get your damn clothes on.

473
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,853
Man: <i>Yeah, go ahead
and send him in.</i>

474
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,422
Settle that stuff
when we have...

475
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,290
you want to see what
happens to little girls

476
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,925
when they stay out all night?

477
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,163
Ow.

478
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,867
Officer: <i>Get a shot of the body.</i>

479
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,101
<i>Hands are cut off.</i>

480
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,671
This guy is not gonna stop.

481
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,339
<i>Do you understand?</i>

482
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,417
What are you doing?

483
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:49,152
I've never seen mom
so upset before.

484
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:52,288
Mrs. Giordano: <i>Vicky!
Vicky, are you dressed?</i>

485
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,057
Vicky:<i> Mary.</i>

486
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,310
<i>Sherry tarnley.</i>

487
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:25,221
Sherry: <i>No, just listen to me.</i>

488
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,123
- <i> I didn't lie. I...</i>
- <i> You're lying.</i>

489
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,125
You're lying to me.

490
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:31,728
No, I...

491
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,796
you're just like every damn
one of them, aren't you?

492
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,264
Aren't you?

493
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,402
Ahh.

494
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,808
Unh!

495
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,452
All right,
you take care of the...

496
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,053
Officer: <i>Get down, Moore.</i>

497
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,522
<i>Moore, get the hell down.</i>

498
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,392
Just settle down, buddy.
Settle down.

499
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:40,196
What's going on?

500
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,998
You know the girl
they found this morning?

501
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,433
Turns out she's been dead
for at least a month.

502
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,969
She was covered in the same
kind of trace dirt

503
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,938
that they found
on the donlevy body.

504
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,439
So the neighbors,
they I.D. This guy

505
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:53,042
they see hanging around...
Melvin Moore.

506
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:56,212
Turns out he's got six prior
sex offenses with minors,

507
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,147
was at the carnival,

508
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,150
and had in his possession
a bloody hunting knife

509
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,519
that appears to have
cut through flesh.

510
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,423
It's all over.

511
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,183
<i>That's all, Kathleen.</i>

512
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,585
<i>You can do it.</i>

513
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:37,620
- <i> You got it. Come on.</i>
- <i> Yeah.</i>

514
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:39,889
<i>Whoo!</i>

515
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:41,424
<i>You did it. Hooray!</i>

516
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,059
<i>Good girl.</i>

517
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,932
Margie: <i>It's weird.</i>

518
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,268
Sometimes when
I come in here...

519
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,639
I think she's still alive.

520
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,177
Mrs. Donlevy: <i>Margie!</i>

521
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,381
My mom's not doing too well.

522
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,149
I'll be right back.

523
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,603
Earl.

524
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:11,213
What night of the week
did Kathleen disappear?

525
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,715
A Friday.

526
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:14,650
Why?

527
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:18,154
March 25th. Friday.

528
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:23,025
April 29th, it's a Friday.

529
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,461
They're all Fridays.

530
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,000
They're all last Fridays
of the month.

531
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,171
Oh, my God.

532
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:37,173
One day away.

533
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:17,613
Paper.

534
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,782
Paper. Paper.

535
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,435
I tried to call, but...

536
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:56,839
Jesus Christ. You scared
the shit out of me.

537
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,642
- <i> How'd you get in?</i>
- I picked the lock.

538
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,710
You picked the lock?

539
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,579
Um...

540
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,748
Guinn has a suspect.

541
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,650
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

542
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,318
Turns out the guy was locked up

543
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,554
for three months around the
time the girl was killed.

544
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:14,323
<i>They released him an hour ago.</i>

545
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:17,726
What about the knife?

546
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:20,496
Animal blood.

547
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,499
But while everyone was going
ape-shit over this guy,

548
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,502
I logged into n.C.I.C.
Guess what.

549
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:29,738
Our friend Earl parkins
is a felon,

550
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,208
did hard time at the point
of the Mountain.

551
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:37,246
What's wrong?

552
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:40,649
Nothing. I'm just tired.

553
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,385
Hey, you okay about last night?

554
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,955
Yeah. I got to go home.

555
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:47,856
I'm grounded.

556
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:58,968
Glass cleaner.
Everybody has bleach.

557
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,636
It's no big deal.

558
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,472
Mary: <i>And then I found the car.</i>

559
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:41,710
I can't believe
you've been doing

560
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:43,846
exactly what I
told you not to do.

561
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,623
All right.

562
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,558
I'll check the plates
of the Malibu

563
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,461
to see if they're
registered to Campbell.

564
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,032
But I want you to stop

565
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:06,468
this Nancy drew bullshit
right now!

566
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,583
You think I'm imagining
all this, don't you?

567
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:25,421
A cop has to be able
to distinguish

568
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,356
between fact and fantasy.

569
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,359
What if I eliminate
my other suspect

570
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,428
and prove my instincts
are right?

571
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,563
I want you home. Now.

572
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:40,903
Radio:
<i>And Jesus said unto them,</i>

573
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:44,106
<i>"suffer the little children</i>
<i>up to me."</i>

574
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:48,811
- Excuse me. Is Sherry home?
- She's at work.

575
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,747
<i>Put your hands on the radio,</i>
<i>and feel the power of...</i>

576
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:55,751
have you traveled with
him at all this year?

577
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,363
<i>Driver number 17,</i>

578
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:09,832
<i>report to loading</i>
<i>dock 12 for pickup.</i>

579
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:12,501
<i>Driver 17, report to 12.</i>

580
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,375
Earl loves me.

581
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,649
If you remember anything
about those Friday nights,

582
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:29,451
will you please call me?

583
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,527
Roxanne: <i>Go away.</i>

584
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,397
It's Mary giordano.
I need to talk to you.

585
00:56:43,134 --> 00:56:45,667
<i>Is he screwing you too?</i>

586
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:51,774
He's a suspect
in a murder case.

587
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,543
I'm trying to establish
his whereabouts.

588
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:57,780
You know the problem
with little rich girls?

589
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:01,850
They stick
their lily-white noses in

590
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:03,619
where they don't belong.

591
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:07,556
Look, in order to clear him,

592
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,491
I need an eyewitness alibi

593
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,660
for at least one of the
Friday nights I gave you.

594
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,196
<i>You want to tell me</i>
<i>where he was, great.</i>

595
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:15,731
If you don't, I'm going to get

596
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,466
the cops down here
now and ask you

597
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:18,967
where you were
the night of the murder.

598
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,570
Get out.

599
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,152
Please.

600
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,021
He's in trouble.

601
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:40,689
I'm trying to help him.

602
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,465
He has Friday nights off.

603
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,570
He went out of town
the last Friday in march.

604
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:55,971
Where did he go?

605
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,807
His mother tried
to kill herself

606
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,743
in some kind of
institution in Phoenix.

607
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:04,213
<i>Earl went down there</i>
<i>to see her.</i>

608
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:06,248
Do you know the name
of the place?

609
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:11,987
Sunnybrook.

610
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,524
Like the farm.

611
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:19,661
Woman:<i>Good evening. Sunnybrook.</i>

612
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:24,233
Hi. I'm the daughter of a
patient there, a Mrs. Parkins.

613
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,702
My brother's missing,
and I'm trying to locate him.

614
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:29,905
Can you tell me whether he
visited her on march 29th?

615
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:32,808
<i>I'm sorry. We do not</i>
<i>keep detailed records.</i>

616
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,844
<i>All I can tell you is whether or
not she had any visitors that day.</i>

617
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,013
Well, could you please do that?

618
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,781
<i>Let's see.</i>

619
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:42,584
<i>Mrs. May parkins.</i>

620
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:45,587
<i>All right, had one male
visitor on the 29th.</i>

621
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,156
<i>He arrived at 7:00 P.M.</i>
<i>and left at 9:00.</i>

622
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,158
<i>He came back</i>
<i>the next day at noon.</i>

623
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,760
Are you sure?

624
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:54,696
<i>Absolutely.</i>
<i>I recorded it myself.</i>

625
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,105
Vicky: <i>What are you doing?</i>

626
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:07,109
Baiting a trap.

627
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:21,723
Recording:
<i>Hi there. This is Tony.</i>

628
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,125
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

629
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,626
<i>Leave a message at the beep,</i>

630
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,028
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

631
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,031
Mary: <i>Hi. It's me.</i>

632
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:31,300
<i>Meet me at</i>
<i>the mini mart at 9:00.</i>

633
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:33,235
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

634
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,741
Hi.

635
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,243
Look, we got to make this fast.

636
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,612
I got to get back
to Earl the pearl.

637
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:44,980
Earl didn't do it.

638
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,783
What do you mean?

639
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:51,753
I thought you said
you didn't have a car.

640
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,355
I don't.

641
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:57,125
Then why is there a blue
Malibu parked in your garage?

642
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,595
What?

643
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:04,166
There's a blue Malibu
parked in your garage.

644
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,606
It must be my landlord's.

645
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,242
Does that have anything
to do with the bleach...

646
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,844
you killed her.

647
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,182
Shit. For a second,
I thought...

648
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,262
Excuse me.

649
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,998
I have to go murder someone.

650
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,102
Tony:<i> Mary.</i>

651
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,006
Unh!

652
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,143
<i>Mary, Mary.</i>

653
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:33,815
<i>Row number three...</i>

654
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,183
- Mary, you okay?
- <i> Will stand up.</i>

655
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,518
It's just a dream.

656
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,121
Just breathe slow.

657
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:40,088
Teacher: Are you all right?

658
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:45,060
Take her out of the sun.
Get her some water.

659
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,367
What the hell is going on?

660
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:53,869
You don't return my calls.

661
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,937
Please stay with me tonight.

662
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,073
It's the exchange dance.

663
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:00,041
Please.

664
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,110
Come with me.

665
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,822
That info on the
Malibu plates came in.

666
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:25,934
Is there a girl with...

667
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:28,336
Blonde hair that lives here?

668
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,006
She's not here right now.

669
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,176
I need to talk to her.

670
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,911
Um...

671
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:38,980
Something's happening, and I...

672
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,123
I want you
to watch your sister.

673
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:03,438
What's going on?

674
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,207
I don't know.
I mean, some weird girl

675
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,608
stops by the house
today, right,

676
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,143
totally freaks out my mom.

677
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,945
Liz: <i>Who was it?</i>

678
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:11,880
She had, like, this gigantic
bruise over her arm.

679
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,915
It looked like somebody
kicked the shit out of her.

680
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:14,983
What?

681
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:20,055
Some weird girl
stopped by the house today.

682
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,490
It looked like she was
on something, you know?

683
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:23,992
What did she say?

684
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,393
Nothing. She just said

685
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,996
she wanted to talk to you.

686
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,365
I'll be right back.
I got to go see her.

687
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:34,202
You see?

688
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,872
She's acting
like a total psycho.

689
01:04:58,629 --> 01:05:00,295
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

690
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,272
Mary:<i> Damn it.</i>

691
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,335
Tony: <i>No way am I going
up on that thing.</i>

692
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,102
Oh, my God.

693
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:51,506
Oh, my God.

694
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,575
No!

695
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:54,676
<i>No!</i>

696
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:55,744
Stop it!

697
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,037
Are you okay?

698
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:25,440
Mary.

699
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:28,243
I'm sorry I hit you.

700
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,345
I thought you were going
to take us both down.

701
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:36,151
I'm not going
to hurt you, Mary.

702
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:38,520
<i>I was scared to death up there.</i>

703
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:45,794
Why was today circled
on your calendar?

704
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:49,631
I had my final exams
this morning.

705
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,766
I passed. I'm a cop.

706
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,469
<i>Overheard Earl</i>
<i>and that woman Roxanne</i>

707
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,071
<i>talking about you.</i>

708
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:57,138
I got worried.

709
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,339
I borrowed my landlord's car

710
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,808
to make sure you were okay.

711
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:10,685
Here.

712
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,387
You dropped these.

713
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,500
Come with me.

714
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,102
I don't want to leave you here.

715
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,637
Where are you going?

716
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:32,474
Sherry tarnley's
been reported missing.

717
01:08:34,845 --> 01:08:36,678
Hey, hey, what's going on?

718
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,680
We found the decomposed
girl's jacket.

719
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,815
Forensics looked at a print
off one of the buttons,

720
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:42,884
and they matched to a guy
who works at the carnival.

721
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:44,452
Who?

722
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,522
An ex-con named Earl parkins.

723
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:30,798
<i>Sherry.</i>

724
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,800
Oh, my God.

725
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,402
Shh, shh, shh.

726
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:35,870
Quiet. Quiet.

727
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:15,677
Officer: <i>Hey, want
me to bag the noose?</i>

728
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,947
<i>Nah. It's a slam-dunk suicide.</i>

729
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,584
It's all my fault.

730
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:25,653
Why didn't you tell me
about parkins?

731
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:29,791
Officer: <i>Keep the tape up.</i>

732
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,560
<i>Get the lab here.</i>

733
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,362
I want you in my office

734
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:35,897
at 8:00 A.M.

735
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:36,998
Yes, sir.

736
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,634
Looks like the guy
left us a note.

737
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,438
Officer: <i>We got to run
this stuff back down.</i>

738
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:46,541
Woman: <i>These young women</i>

739
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,810
<i>will now step into the world...</i>

740
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,747
And take with them an education

741
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,882
that will serve them well.

742
01:10:56,553 --> 01:11:00,488
Girls, you've only
just begun your journey.

743
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:04,626
May your lives
be filled with love,

744
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:08,429
<i>charity, hope, and happiness.</i>

745
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:16,771
Mother: We're so proud of you.

746
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,320
Woman: <i>Well, we wouldn't
miss this for the world.</i>

747
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:33,688
Man: <i>Not for the world.</i>

748
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,392
Excuse me.

749
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:39,661
Girls: <i>Party! Party!</i>

750
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:42,730
<i>Party! Party! Party!</i>

751
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,939
Hi.

752
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:57,445
Hi.

753
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,714
Congratulations.

754
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,486
Sherry came to me.

755
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:25,473
<i>Chevy Malibu registered</i>
<i>to Daniel Henry moffat.</i>

756
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,977
Sir, we're going to order
out for some Chinese.

757
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:31,579
Do you want some?

758
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:32,947
<i>Jesus.</i>

759
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:35,616
<i>How many people did you</i>
<i>interrogate today?</i>

760
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:37,785
Parkins was in the joint
for forgery.

761
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:39,487
He never hurt a flea.

762
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:41,989
Now all of a sudden, he
confesses to six murders?

763
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:44,025
Yeah, well,
the note contains details

764
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,626
only the killer could know.

765
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,995
The guy wasn't a whacko.

766
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,098
All his jail
psych tests were normal.

767
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:54,135
He's a guy with
no reason to kill.

768
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:14,622
Get this dusted for me.

769
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:29,871
<i>I'm sorry to bother you,</i>
<i>Mr. Tarnley,</i>

770
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:32,874
but I need to ask you
one more question.

771
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:35,176
To your knowledge, did parkins
have any female friends

772
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:36,878
<i>other than your daughter?</i>

773
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:40,681
Did Sherry ever mention anyone?

774
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:44,752
She mentioned an ex-wife
a couple of times,

775
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:48,956
said she was real jealous.
"Jealous," I said.

776
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,659
"Now, that's what you get for
fornicating against the lord."

777
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:53,561
- <i> You throw down his commandment...</i>
- Please.

778
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:57,799
This ex-wife, do you remember
the woman's name?

779
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:01,669
Roxanne.

780
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,137
Roxanne something.

781
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,046
This is one-Stanley-seven.

782
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:47,648
I need to get an a.P.B.
On the teletype right away.

783
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,183
Roxanne dicarlo...

784
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:51,853
Caucasian, 35,

785
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,155
may be dangerous.

786
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:25,786
Earl: <i>Have a nice ride.</i>

787
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:27,889
Sherry: <i>Earl loves me.</i>

788
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,024
Officer: <i>Looks like the
guy left us a note.</i>

789
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,627
<i>Suicide.</i>

790
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,715
The noose.

791
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,104
There's no way
he could do this with one hand.

792
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:02,710
Tony: <i>You like my photos?</i>

793
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,414
Hmm?

794
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:08,816
I was working that night.

795
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:11,218
A person can get upset.

796
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:14,221
Hey, we got that print info
back on the styrofoam cup.

797
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:18,859
What is it?

798
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,796
Jesus Christ.

799
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:25,099
Aren't you going
to ask any questions?

800
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,169
Cops are supposed
to ask questions.

801
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,906
Earl and I go way back.

802
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:34,275
I did him a favor once.

803
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:36,410
When he got out,
he let me borrow his cars.

804
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:38,145
Nice guy.

805
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:41,115
Till he fell in love
with Sherry.

806
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:42,783
Then he got the idea

807
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:45,786
the world was
a beautiful place.

808
01:18:45,788 --> 01:18:47,722
I had to teach him a lesson.

809
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:52,426
It was so easy
to set it all up.

810
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:59,300
You know,
I followed you that day,

811
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:01,168
from the station to the pool,

812
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,903
don't you, Mary?

813
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,740
I watched you at night,

814
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:07,842
looked through your window,

815
01:19:07,844 --> 01:19:10,277
saw you touching my picture.

816
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:16,083
The moment I saw you,

817
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,520
marching around
in that little uniform...

818
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:23,924
So sure of the world...

819
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:28,996
just knew I had to be
your teacher too.

820
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:39,907
You planted the rabbit's
foot at Kathleen's...

821
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:44,411
The prints that
implicated parkins...

822
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:49,550
The suicide note.

823
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:52,887
It's time to open
your graduation present.

824
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,177
Did she say
where she was going?

825
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:18,179
- Vicky: No.
- Did she say anything?

826
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:20,481
After the graduation,

827
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,484
she kept asking me
why this girl Sherry

828
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,220
would go to a recycling
place alone

829
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:28,556
with someone who
she knew was dangerous.

830
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:36,363
Kathleen?

831
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:41,435
<i>She was the easiest one of all.</i>

832
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,306
Hi.

833
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:47,374
<i>I told her I was</i>
<i>a police officer.</i>

834
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:48,976
<i>I needed her to check out</i>

835
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:50,611
<i>some illegal activity</i>
<i>over at the mini mart.</i>

836
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,581
Good. It's a good job,
very serious job.

837
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,249
<i>Apparently the clerk there</i>

838
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:57,418
<i>had been selling drugs</i>
<i>to junior high school kids</i>

839
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,421
<i>who brought cleaning
supplies to the counter.</i>

840
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:03,057
<i>Could she go in, purchase some,</i>

841
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,326
<i>see if he approached her?</i>

842
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:08,863
<i>She was such</i>
<i>a good little citizen.</i>

843
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,381
No. He didn't try
to sell me anything.

844
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,050
Don't get up.

845
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,618
You don't want to get up.

846
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:14,194
Bang.

847
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:16,096
Guinn: <i>Hold it right
there, Campbell.</i>

848
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:20,134
Put your hands up slowly.

849
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:25,572
Well, if isn't papa cop...

850
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:28,142
Come to save little baby cop.

851
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:29,376
Guinn: <i>Shut up.</i>

852
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:34,114
You know, after we had
our little talk,

853
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,183
I got to wondering
who the hell you were,

854
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,085
so I lifted your prints

855
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,120
off the coffee cup
you left in my office.

856
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:44,124
Then I got a match
from the f.B.I.

857
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,493
Daniel Henry moffat.

858
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,329
Roomed with Earl parkins

859
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:50,564
in the Utah state penitentiary.

860
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,534
<i>Whose prints did you use</i>

861
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:56,203
<i>for your cadet exam, moffat?</i>

862
01:22:56,205 --> 01:22:59,039
The girl we found
up on skyline?

863
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:03,377
<i>Get on the floor.</i>

864
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:05,112
<i>Get on the floor!</i>

865
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:15,522
Put your hands
behind your back.

866
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:21,395
Ohh!

867
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:22,696
No!

868
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,021
Guinn:<i> Ohh!</i>

869
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:57,431
Ohh!

870
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,406
Aah! Aah!

871
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:53,253
Why?

872
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:58,325
Why?

873
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:02,162
Why?

874
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,134
No reason, Mary.

875
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:09,169
That's the real world.

876
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:07,361
Ohh!

877
01:26:12,902 --> 01:26:14,535
Oh, my God.

878
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:23,744
Mary.

879
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:29,917
<i>Mary.</i>

880
01:26:29,919 --> 01:26:31,585
<i>Can you reach?</i>

881
01:26:42,331 --> 01:26:44,498
No.

882
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,567
<i>No.</i>

883
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:43,590
<i>¶ If there were time ¶</i>

884
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:51,592
<i>¶ I would capture</i>
<i>every moment ¶</i>

885
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:56,303
<i>¶ and ask what lies between ¶</i>

886
01:27:56,305 --> 01:28:03,010
<i>¶ each grain of sand ¶</i>

887
01:28:03,012 --> 01:28:05,812
<i>¶ and if I thought ¶</i>

888
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:09,549
<i>¶ I could carry ¶</i>

889
01:28:09,551 --> 01:28:13,787
<i>¶ the burden ¶</i>

890
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:17,457
<i>¶ I'd show you what I know ¶</i>

891
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,527
<i>¶ of this journey ¶</i>

892
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:25,732
<i>¶ through the heart... ¶</i>

893
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:50,624
<i>¶ And all alone ¶</i>

894
01:28:50,626 --> 01:28:53,493
<i>¶ I can't hear ¶</i>

895
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:57,998
<i>¶ the voices ¶</i>

896
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,470
<i>¶ but I can see</i>
<i>the many faces ¶</i>

897
01:29:03,472 --> 01:29:07,874
<i>¶ of my soul ¶</i>

898
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:13,613
<i>¶ and if one mask</i>
<i>should erase ¶</i>

899
01:29:13,615 --> 01:29:17,784
<i>¶ another ¶</i>

900
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:20,787
<i>¶ well, please forgive me ¶</i>

901
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:24,691
<i>¶ but even children ¶</i>

902
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:29,996
<i>¶ can grow old ¶</i>

903
01:29:33,102 --> 01:29:38,071
<i>¶ in a flash from within ¶</i>

904
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:42,609
<i>¶ as all I've called my own ¶</i>

905
01:29:42,611 --> 01:29:45,045
<i>¶ disappears ¶</i>

906
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:48,048
<i>¶ watch me now ¶</i>

907
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:51,685
<i>¶ for I have hardened ¶</i>

908
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:56,556
<i>¶ to this world ¶</i>

909
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:02,095
<i>¶ if every breath ¶</i>

910
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:08,568
<i>¶ if every heartbeat ¶</i>

911
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:12,139
<i>¶ has led me here ¶</i>

912
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:18,578
<i>¶ to the things</i>
<i>that I've been shown ¶</i>

913
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,681
<i>¶ and if I thought ¶</i>

914
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:24,985
<i>¶ you could carry ¶</i>

915
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:29,456
<i>¶ the burden ¶</i>

916
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:33,493
<i>¶ I'd show you</i>
<i>what I've learned ¶</i>

917
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:35,929
<i>¶ on this journey ¶</i>

918
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:41,201
<i>¶ through the heart ¶</i>

919
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:48,975
<i>¶ just a flash from within ¶</i>

920
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:53,547
<i>¶ as all I've called my own ¶</i>

921
01:30:53,549 --> 01:30:56,450
<i>¶ disappears ¶</i>

922
01:30:56,452 --> 01:30:59,453
<i>¶ watch me now ¶</i>

923
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:02,456
<i>¶ for I have hardened ¶</i>

924
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:08,228
