and told her where I was.

183

that I take a photo

was together, and happy.

San Diego from Vegas,

190
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:28,003
why did they move there?

191
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:32,015
Well, in actuality it
could've been any city.

192
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,251
We just had to get away
from the casinos, and uh,

193
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:37,552
see, my dad kinda got sucked in,

194
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:40,061
and he wouldn't quit gambling
while we were there so,

195
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:41,861
mom gave him the ultimatum,

196
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,113
and California looked good.

197
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,798

198

that's what you're asking.

199
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:57,877

1083

but I wanted to catch you
before you went off to work.

1084

complain about the noise?

do with the noise at all,

1097

No, it has nothing to do with any

1098

whether they fight

1111
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:41,048

they dig up their yard

1112

1113
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,562
Mitch, when you made your first dig son,

1114
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:50,373
there was a lot of money
wagered and exchanged,

1115
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:53,063
and Mrs. Parker, when you were researching

1116
01:12:53,065 --> 01:12:56,141
that suitcase handle,
there were a lot of bets

1117
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:57,310

Mr. Parker, I'm sorry to tell you,

1119
01:13:00,317 --> 01:13:03,601
but there's no money in your yard, sir.

1120

It's nothing to be ashamed of,

1122
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:11,797
but I'm gonna need statements
from each one of you

1127
01:13:16,555 --> 01:13:17,898
