1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,252
(suspenseful music)

2
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:16,486
(doors thudding)

3
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:17,701
- [Paramedic] Coming through.

4
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,330
Out of the way.

5
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,163
- What have we got?

6
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,790
- We've got a 45-year-old female in V-fib,

7
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,090
been down 20 minutes,
initiated CPR and arrived.

8
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,190
- Okay, have you shocked her yet?

9
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,630
- Three times, no response.

10
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,880
- One round of epi, continue CPR.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,713
- We're in.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,833
- What have we got here?

13
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,180
- Female, she's in V-fib, down 20 minutes.

14
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,160
We've administered epinephrine,
shocked three times.

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,423
One, two, three.

16
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,830
- All right, Dr. Massey, let's focus.

17
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,700
What would you do next?

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,690
- Okay, she's still in V-fib.

19
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,580
I'd give her another round of epinephrine.

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,610
Defibrillator again.

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,810
- All right, people, let's go, let's go.

22
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,643
Where's respiratory?

23
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:49,604
Come on, let's intubate her.

24
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:50,820
- Is she gonna be all right?

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,290
- Are you a relative?

26
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,830
- Her son.

27
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,970
- Okay, look, I really
need you to wait outside.

28
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,240
- Okay, she's intubated.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,590
Where are those paddles at?

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,800
- Charge to 360.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,968
- Charged.
- Clear.

32
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,750
(defibrillator buzzing)

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,450
- Charge.
- Charged.

34
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,085
- Clear.

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,330
(defibrillator buzzing)

36
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,519
- What's going on?

37
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:10,352
Can't you do something?

38
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,500
- Nurse, can we get him
out of here, please?

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,020
- She's gonna live, right?

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,450
She's all we've got, me
and my little sister.

41
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,340
You gotta help her.

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,140
- We are doing everything that we can.

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,500
The best way for you to
help us to wait outside.

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,333
Please.

45
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,755
- Charged.
- Clear.

46
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:30,250
(defibrillator buzzing)

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,820
She's not responding.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,574
Do you want me to call it?

49
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:36,324
(dramatic music)

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,580
- Give me a scalpel and a rib spreader.

51
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,620
- What are you doing?

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,810
- Gonna open her chest.

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,860
- Here, in the ER?

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,240
You're gonna perform open-heart surgery?

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,300
- I am just gonna get her started,

56
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll let the surgeons do the real work.

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,410
Somebody call cardio
to prep a surgery room.

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,670
- Putting your hand in the patient's chest

59
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,160
and massaging her heart proper procedure?

60
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,350
- I don't know, I've never done it.

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,010
- Look, I realize that
I'm just a resident here,

62
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,070
but you do know that she's dead, right?

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,916
- Not until I say so.

64
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,666
(dramatic music)

65
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,413
You got that?

66
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,503
Not until I say so.

67
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,649
(blood squishing)

68
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,658
Come on.

69
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:29,658
(suspenseful music)

70
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,310
(heart monitor beeping)

71
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,153
- We got it.

72
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:44,003
(soft piano music)

73
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:08,140
- How is she doing?

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,523
- She's alive, because of you.

75
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,410
- Nah, she's alive
because of the pacemaker

76
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,650
the surgeons put in.

77
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,230
- I know what happened, you saved her.

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,023
- She'll be out for a while.

79
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,310
Why don't you go home
to your little sister?

80
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,470
- I called the neighbor, she's sleeping.

81
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,270
I'll stay here, if it's okay?

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,343
- Yeah, of course.

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,740
- Dr. Wyatt, I'll never be
able to thank you enough.

84
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,690
- You already have.

85
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,330
Sarah, could you order a cot

86
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,100
for Claire Randall's son, please,

87
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,580
and make sure he gets something to eat.

88
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,457
He's so stressed out.

89
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,100
- You know, I doubt the
other attending physicians

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,380
would have tried something so risky

91
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,480
to save that woman's life.

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,030
- Sometimes you just get lucky.

93
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,300
- That was great.

94
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,290
- [Beth] Do me a favor and...

95
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,280
No, this one here.

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,030
- You hear about her Lazarus trick?

97
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,030
- No trick, just good medicine.

98
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,360
- Well apparently, good timing too.

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,810
- [Doctor] What'd you mean?

100
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,603
- Have they named the new head of ER?

101
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,760
- It's not over till it's over.

102
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:25,119
(ominous music)

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,850
- What time is it?

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,420
- Oh my God, honey, you
are not gonna believe it.

105
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,720
There, there was this woman
in severe cardiac arrest

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,180
and Massey was ready to call it.

107
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,123
I probably would have too,

108
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,820
but her son was there and I don't know,

109
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,220
I just felt like I needed...

110
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,043
Jake?

111
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,363
Hey.

112
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,050
I thought you were listening.

113
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,443
- It's two o'clock in the morning.

114
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,203
I'm trying to sleep.

115
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,343
You should be too.

116
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,710
- Honey, I just held this
woman's heart in my hand,

117
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,543
I can't sleep.

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,437
- Mm, that's great, honey.

119
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,690
(suspenseful music)

120
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:49,869
(Beth chuckles)

121
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,869
(suspenseful music)

122
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:19,221
(Beth exhales)

123
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,126
- Oh.

124
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:29,793
(ominous music)

125
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,085
- Thanks, dad.

126
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:03,247
- It better not be tuna.

127
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:04,580
- Peanut butter.

128
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:09,590
You try and keep your hands
in your pockets today.

129
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,639
- Honey.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,472
(lips smacking)

131
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,333
- There's chicken
marinating in the fridge.

132
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,230
(hand thudding)

133
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,740
Come on.

134
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,410
Still nothing.

135
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,710
- Dr. Wyatt?

136
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,543
- Hey.

137
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,270
You're from last night.

138
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,103
- Jamie Randall.

139
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:27,960
- Right, Jamie.

140
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,366
How, how are you doing?

141
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:30,340
- Good.
- Good.

142
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,850
- I just wanted to thank you
again for saving my mom's life.

143
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,640
- Oh, your mother's a fighter.

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,590
- Yeah.

145
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,423
Yes she is.

146
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,390
Well, you did most of the work.

147
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,570
The docs upstairs say
that she's doing better

148
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,530
and that she may get out of here soon.

149
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,810
- Well, that's great.

150
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,150
I'm really glad to hear that.

151
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,210
- Damn, that IT guy
was supposed to be here

152
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,140
over an hour ago.

153
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,130
- And what's the problem?

154
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,690
- Oh, it's just, you
know, won't work right.

155
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,523
- Sarah, you're beginning to sound

156
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:56,650
like one of our patients.

157
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,670
- And you could do better?

158
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,530
- Well, I, I don't know.

159
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,245
Maybe something with the LAN network or...

160
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:03,002
- Do you mind if I just take a look?

161
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,200
- Oh.

162
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,920
Jamie, you don't have
to do that, that's...

163
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,850
- No, let him.

164
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,910
I could be hours before
that IT guy gets here.

165
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,493
- Okay, try it now.

166
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,040
- No, nothing.

167
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,858
Oh wait, there it is.

168
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,600
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
- What are you, a computer genius?

170
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,110
- Software engineer.

171
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,150
Designer, really.

172
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,110
Mostly video games,

173
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,110
you know the kinds you wish
your kids wouldn't play so much?

174
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,450
- My son just got one

175
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,860
where the dragons are ripping
the arms off of people.

176
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,824
Did you design that video game?

177
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,890
- (chuckles) No, not that one.

178
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,480
I just do a lot of coding, debugging,

179
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,810
not the real nerd stuff.

180
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,320
- Jamie, I would hardly call you a nerd.

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,153
- I would.

182
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:41,050
I've been into computers ever
since I was a little kid.

183
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,083
- Oh, well,

184
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,270
thank you so much.

185
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,670
I, I, I guess that makes us even now.

186
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,233
- Not by a long shot, doc.

187
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,703
- Thank you.

188
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:55,295
- A nice kid.

189
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:58,963
(bells tolling)

190
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,210
- If you're gonna write
a paper on biodiversity,

191
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,740
you have to include an invasive species.

192
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,000
That's plants, animals, even microbes.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,760
When they're introduced into a region,

194
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
they displace the native species.

195
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,976
- Yeah.
(knocking on door)

196
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:12,890
- Am I interrupting?

197
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,480
- I have office hours now, Tom.

198
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,810
- Oh, well I don't think Megan would mind

199
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,120
giving us a few minutes alone.

200
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,640
- No, I'm good, Professor Wyatt.

201
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,533
I really get it now, thanks.

202
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,276
Bye, Professor Wyatt.

203
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,283
Professor Saunders.

204
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,323
- What do you want, Tom?

205
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,973
- Stacy left me.

206
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,193
She took the kids.

207
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,560
- She found out about Jenna?

208
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
- Yeah, only because Jenna cornered her

209
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,940
in the supermarket near produce.

210
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,370
Apparently, there was an
incident with a cantaloupe.

211
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,253
Stacy's now banned from the market.

212
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,990
- Rule number one, never
sleep with a student.

213
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,740
- I was hoping you could
run interference for me.

214
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,410
- Ah, not a good idea.

215
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,800
- Why not?

216
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,850
- Because my contract is almost up

217
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,520
and I have yet to be published.

218
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,490
- Nothing?

219
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,323
- Nada.

220
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:13,156
- In two years?

221
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:13,989
- In two years.

222
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,930
- Oh man.

223
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,763
- Yeah.

224
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,700
- Look, I know you got your own problems.

225
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,863
Any advice on how to save my marriage?

226
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,343
- Well, I can't guarantee
that it'll get Stacy back.

227
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,381
Stop sleeping with your students.

228
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,633
- Oh, come on.

229
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,240
You've never been tempted by a co-ed?

230
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,970
The low rise jeans and their
big eyes staring at you

231
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,760
like you know everything?

232
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,150
- Yeah, sure, I've been tempted,

233
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,083
but unlike you, I didn't follow through.

234
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,013
- Well, I envy you,

235
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,413
and your marriage.

236
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,737
All right now, I'll see you tomorrow.

237
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,503
- Ah so, Dr. Wyatt.

238
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,520
As I'm sure you expected,

239
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,840
cardiology raised a stink

240
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,390
over your handling of
the Randall woman's case,

241
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,180
which didn't exactly follow protocol.

242
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,820
- Sir, I only did what I thought
was necessary at the time.

243
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,180
I certainly didn't mean to...

244
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,390
- No, no, I, I believe you, Beth.

245
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,450
Let me finish.

246
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,330
It was the cardiologist on
call who raised the stink,

247
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,070
but as chief of staff, I told him that

248
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,720
we're in the business of saving lives

249
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,450
and we were damn lucky to
have you there last night.

250
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,250
- Well, I appreciate that, sir.

251
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,427
Thank you very much.

252
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:38,010
- And I think we'd be damn lucky

253
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,710
to have you as the new head of ER.

254
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,043
- Really?

255
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,160
- The board of trustees hasn't made

256
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,433
their final decision yet.

257
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,070
I'm sure you know that Dr. Doyle

258
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,550
is in contention for the job?

259
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,230
- Yes, I do.

260
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,120
- He's a bit of a cold
fish, if you ask my opinion,

261
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,830
but he's definitely competent.

262
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,820
Plus he has seniority over you.

263
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,320
- I'm aware of that, sir.

264
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,180
- And then there's the matter

265
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,123
that he has no family to speak of,

266
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,400
no other demands on his time

267
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,330
to take his focus away from the job.

268
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,790
- Sir, I am aware of that too,

269
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,220
but my family obligations

270
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,983
have never interfered with my work.

271
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,990
- I believe you, Beth.

272
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,200
So I'd like your professional opinion.

273
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,980
Take a look at these
residency applications

274
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,370
and tell me which of the
hundreds that we've received

275
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,721
we should consider accepting
in our little family.

276
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:26,554
- Okay.

277
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:30,886
- [PA Announcer] Dr.
Schadeling to obstetrics,

278
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,303
Dr. Schadeling to obstetrics.

279
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,765
- [Beth] Hey everybody, I'm home.

280
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:36,630
- Hey.

281
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,036
- Hey mom.

282
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,550
We're gulping down pizza.

283
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,663
- Yeah, I see that.

284
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,280
Sorry I'm late.

285
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,610
- We're used to it.

286
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,510
- Friedman threw something
at me last minute.

287
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,830
But he also told me that
I'm firmly in the running

288
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,030
for becoming head of ER.

289
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,933
- Ah, I would've expected nothing less.

290
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
Now, would you like cheese or pepperoni?

291
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,543
- Pizza, Jake?

292
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,127
Can we talk about all this
junk food for the kids?

293
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,300
- Oh, come on, Beth, it's
only a couple of pizzas.

294
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,390
- I told you that there was chicken

295
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,330
in the fridge this morning.

296
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,650
All you had to do is throw
it in the oven for an hour.

297
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,490
- Yeah, well I have midterms to grade,

298
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,530
and pizza just seemed
like the easiest thing.

299
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,860
- I'm trying to be a
responsible mother here,

300
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,110
but I'm working 70 hours a week

301
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,470
and I can't always make
a home cooked dinner,

302
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,890
but I think I can do that in pizza.

303
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,720
- Well, maybe you should
stop trying so hard

304
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,120
and just be here more often.

305
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,370
- I'm doing my best, Jake.

306
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,923
- Yeah, but is it good enough?

307
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,525
(ominous music)

308
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,250
- Maybe he's right.

309
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,679
Maybe I can't have it all.

310
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,266
What do you think?

311
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,933
(ominous music)

312
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,055
In real life?

313
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,722
(ominous music)

314
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:51,188
(serene soft pop music)

315
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,803
Check, please.

316
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,423
- You must be Dr. Beth.

317
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,053
I'm Finn_74.

318
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,790
You weren't leaving, were you?

319
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:24,614
I'm not that late.

320
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,930
Oh, maybe I am.

321
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,687
Well, then I'm glad I caught you.

322
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,490
- Um...

323
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,140
- That will be on my tab,
and I'll have a Chardonnay.

324
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,270
- I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

325
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,603
- Uh no, I don't think so.

326
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:44,350
Hey, you wanna get an appetizer?

327
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,900
The stuffed mushrooms here are to die for.

328
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,307
And, you know, I haven't
had a thing to eat all day.

329
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:51,130
- You know, I, I really have to go.

330
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:51,963
- What's wrong?

331
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,170
- I thought I was meeting a man.

332
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,933
- And why would you think that?

333
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:02,640
- Um, your name, Finn.

334
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,470
I, is that your last name?

335
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,760
- No, Connors is my last name.

336
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,810
My first name is Finn.

337
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,793
My dad was a Mark Twain nut.

338
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
- What about the flirting?

339
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,133
- So you admit you were flirting?

340
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,060
- No, I was, it didn't...

341
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,653
It was harmless.

342
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,103
- Exactly.

343
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,123
Look Beth, you may have
thought you were meeting a man,

344
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,050
I just thought I was meeting a friend.

345
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,030
I mean, really, what did you
expect to happen tonight?

346
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,570
- I'm not a lesbian.

347
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,920
- I never thought you were.

348
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:50,973
- Then why did you wanna meet me?

349
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,633
- Because you seemed really nice.

350
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,820
I mean, we really made a connection online

351
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,810
and we're in the same line of work.

352
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,630
No, I'm not a doctor but...

353
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:09,570
I, I really like being a paramedic,

354
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,733
it's just, it's just hard sometimes.

355
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,303
And, you know, you seemed to understand.

356
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,980
The truth is I've been, um,

357
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,320
on a leave of absence

358
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,323
since my partner committed suicide.

359
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,693
- I'm sorry.

360
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,013
- Thanks.

361
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,130
We just, we just really hit it off and...

362
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,667
I could use a friend right now.

363
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,123
- Well...

364
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,433
all right, then.

365
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,173
To friends.

366
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,153
- To friendship.

367
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:07,940
(glasses clinking)

368
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,140
- So how'd the drinks turn out?

369
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,923
- Uh okay, I guess.

370
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,030
- Friedman or the board of trustees

371
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,970
give you any clue which way they're going?

372
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,940
- No, uh-huh.

373
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,343
Mostly shop talk about the hospital.

374
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,430
- You have to go to the bar for that?

375
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,333
- Oh, they're having
dinner there afterwards.

376
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,091
(Beth knocking on door)

377
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:38,580
You paged me, sir.

378
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,413
- Dr. Wyatt.

379
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,357
Come in, have a seat.

380
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,890
Beth, there's been a lot
of discussion at the board

381
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,000
as to who should run the ER department,

382
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,820
but in the end it came down to
the welfare of the patients.

383
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,620
As you know, we're not run by an HMO,

384
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,760
we're a nonprofit hospital run
by a religious organization

385
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,890
and there are certain ethical principles

386
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,133
which need to be upheld.

387
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,730
Your dedication to your patients

388
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,940
demonstrates a deep, ethical commitment

389
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,540
which the board finds exemplary.

390
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,083
What I'm trying to say is
congratulations, Dr. Wyatt.

391
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,000
You're St. Catherine's new head of ER.

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,743
- Thank you so much, sir.

393
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,000
And the board.

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,550
- Well, don't thank us yet.

395
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,960
There'll be administrative duties

396
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,990
and various committees to sit on,

397
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,460
as well as your regular duties in the ER.

398
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,480
You'll be going straight from
the frying pan into the fire.

399
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,930
- And I will be ready for it.

400
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,270
Thank you, sir.

401
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,220
You won't be sorry.

402
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,113
- I hope not.

403
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,250
- [PA Announcer] Dr. Adams, to the ER.

404
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,840
- Dr. Wyatt,

405
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,463
I understand Congratulations are in order.

406
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:56,296
- Well, you know already.

407
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:57,129
- Well the chief told me first

408
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:58,700
and wanted to smooth things over in case

409
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,760
I had any ideas about
transferring to another hospital.

410
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,770
- So you're staying?

411
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,650
- Of course.

412
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,540
I know that board's
decision wasn't personal

413
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,840
and you're their perfect
family values person,

414
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,839
someone they can trot out at
fundraisers to attract donors.

415
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,350
- Well, it is so nice to know

416
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,920
that we will still be
working together, Doyle.

417
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,180
Saint Catherine's just wouldn't
be the same without you.

418
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,013
Now if you'll excuse me,

419
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,710
I need to check with
administration about my new office.

420
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:29,183
(Dr. Doyle sighs)

421
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,016
Hello.

422
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,133
Hey.

423
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:34,007
Guess what?

424
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,237
I got the promotion.

425
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:39,817
- Yay, mom!
(Beth giggles)

426
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,520
Can I have a promotion too?

427
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,560
- How about the chief of cookies?

428
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,393
- Cool.

429
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,623
- What?

430
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,000
What's the matter?

431
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,063
- Wow.

432
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,540
I didn't think you'd get it.

433
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:07,630
- Well that explains the
complete lack of support.

434
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,463
- Oh, come on Beth,

435
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:09,450
you want me to congratulate you

436
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,870
on your new 90-hour a week job?

437
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,490
What about my career?

438
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,370
The dean made it very clear

439
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,780
I have to publish if I want tenure.

440
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,850
Now how am I supposed to do that

441
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,650
if I'm the only one
looking out for the kids?

442
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,900
- Terri, would you take
your brother upstairs

443
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,800
and get ready for bed?

444
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,313
- But it's only 7:30.

445
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,640
- Do you really want them hearing

446
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,293
what we have to say to each other?

447
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,851
- Come on, kids, upstairs, let's go.

448
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:34,684
Scoot.

449
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,163
- You knew.

450
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,320
You knew this is what I wanted

451
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,210
and you can't start throwing
out the you missed birthdays

452
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,100
then missed recitals and
missed dinners and the,

453
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,330
I mean, it's not, it's not fair.

454
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,560
- And I'm the bad guy for even

455
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,070
thinking about competing
with a sick and dying?

456
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,060
- Hey, my family is my
number one priority.

457
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,400
- Oh, come on, Beth.

458
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,810
If you're gonna go into that quality time

459
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,840
versus quantity argument,

460
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,790
then you should know that you're not

461
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,540
giving your family either one.

462
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,450
Maybe if I or one of the
kids had a heart attack

463
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,050
or got cancer or something, maybe we'd

464
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,157
get higher with you.
- That's a terrible thing

465
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,930
to say.
- It's true!

466
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,620
You're never here.

467
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,360
You missed my dad's recital,

468
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,290
you missed my birthday party.

469
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,450
We were supposed to make cookies

470
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,490
with the girls' names on them.

471
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,703
I hate you!

472
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,063
- Sweetie.

473
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:25,813
(dramatic music)

474
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,124
Beth.

475
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:31,851
(door thudding)

476
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:34,518
(ominous music)

477
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:45,139
(thunder roaring)

478
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:48,389
(easygoing jazz music)

479
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,273
- Hey.

480
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,550
- Hey.

481
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,383
- How you doin'?

482
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,470
- I've been better.

483
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,400
- So what happened?

484
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,643
- My family hates me.

485
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:11,244
- No.

486
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:12,913
I find that hard to believe.

487
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,080
- Well actually, so...

488
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,270
Jake, he, he only resents
me for sabotaging his career

489
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,823
and our family.

490
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:28,443
There's my daughter who said
to my face that she hated me.

491
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:31,370
- Oh, come on, she's just a kid.

492
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,273
She's just lashing out for maximum impact.

493
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,480
I mean, don't you remember
saying horrible things

494
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,930
to your mom and wishing
you could take them back?

495
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,190
- My mom died when I was eight.

496
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:46,627
- Oh.

497
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:48,500
- [Woman] Can we get two more?

498
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,333
- Sorry.

499
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,940
- We were driving up the
coast, just her and me,

500
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,463
and we got a flat.

501
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,870
It was really foggy out and
she went out to change the tire

502
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,623
and was hit by a passing car.

503
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,070
She laid there bleeding
while we waited for help.

504
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,293
Thanks.

505
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,390
She died right in front of me.

506
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,813
I always thought that I
could have saved her if,

507
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,480
if I only knew what to do.

508
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:33,391
- And so, of course,
you became an ER doctor.

509
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:35,661
- I guess.

510
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:42,080
- You wanna know why I became a paramedic?

511
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,300
- Yeah.

512
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,133
Why?

513
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,150
- Because they kept coming to my house

514
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,500
every time my mom would OD.

515
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,513
After a while, they knew my name.

516
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,290
They'd even bring me little gifts.

517
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,953
I thought they were so cool.

518
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,050
Practically, the only
attention I ever got.

519
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,013
Trust me, Beth, you have
a very normal family.

520
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,438
Things will look a lot
brighter in the morning.

521
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:18,688
(easygoing jazz music)

522
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:24,279
(Beth laughing)

523
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:28,670
Okay, I don't know if you
should've had that last one.

524
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:33,103
- Oh, I know, I shouldn't
have, woo, goodness grace.

525
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:34,052
- Are you okay?

526
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,320
- Never had that one before.

527
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,710
- I think I should call you a cab.

528
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,477
- I don't, no, I can drive, I'm fine.

529
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:42,700
Oh.

530
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,940
I don't wanna go home.

531
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:53,163
- (giggles) Well you
have to go home sometime.

532
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,735
- Excuse me, but I can do whatever I want.

533
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:02,107
- (giggles) Yes, ma'am.

534
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:07,173
Let me call you a cab, huh?

535
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,690
- You're a good friend.

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,083
Take me home.

537
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:24,875
- Okay.

538
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:30,445
(ominous music)

539
00:28:48,203 --> 00:28:50,520
(Beth grunts)

540
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,187
(ominous music)

541
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,411
(Beth sighs)

542
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:03,078
(ominous music)

543
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:35,522
- Where have you been?

544
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:36,355
- I called.

545
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:39,409
- You left one drunken
message saying you were sorry.

546
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,318
I must've left a hundred messages

547
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,560
on your answering mach...
- Okay, okay, ssh.

548
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,718
Look, it's been a long night,

549
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:46,100
can we just talk about this tomorrow?

550
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,150
- Do I have a choice?

551
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,806
- I really need a shower.

552
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:56,306
(melancholic piano music)

553
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:26,894
(Beth weeping)
(melancholic piano music)

554
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:42,443
(alarm clock beeping)

555
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:49,044
(melancholic piano music)

556
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,153
- A little to your right.

557
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,690
- How's that?

558
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,523
- Perfect.

559
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,710
- Well I'd give you a tour but this is it.

560
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,543
- Yeah, no worries.

561
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,376
I just wanted to come by

562
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:21,660
and say congratulations on your promotion

563
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,520
and that I know I've got a lot to learn,

564
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,230
but I wanna make myself available to you

565
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,250
so that anything you might
need, I'm your go-to guy.

566
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,800
- Well, I'll keep that in mind.

567
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,150
- Okay then.

568
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,983
Cool.

569
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,050
Bye.

570
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,883
- Bye.

571
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,937
First-year residents.

572
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,624
You gotta love 'em.

573
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:48,362
(laptop beeping)

574
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:51,362
(suspenseful music)

575
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,680
- And then Richie Williams laughed so hard

576
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,050
that soda came out of his nose.

577
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,437
It was so gross.

578
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:17,037
- Eww.
- And then Jenny said...

579
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,953
- Oh, hey kids.

580
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,860
Go get washed up, dinner's almost ready.

581
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,863
- Wow.

582
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,050
- I guess you're all
wondering what's going on,

583
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,370
am I right?

584
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,533
- Yeah, dad always makes the meatballs.

585
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,573
- Well,

586
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,863
I just wanted to apologize.

587
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,000
I know that I've been
real busy with work lately

588
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and I've been asking you for
your patience for a long time.

589
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,463
And you've all been really,
really understanding.

590
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,410
So forgive me for being more of a doctor

591
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,873
these days than a mother.

592
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,983
'Cause I love you very, very much.

593
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,580
And I promise that things are
going to change around here.

594
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,660
And I promise that what
happened last night

595
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,467
will never happen again.

596
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:33,652
(gentle piano music)

597
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,630
- What about the hospital?

598
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:55,057
- Well, one of the perks
of being the head of the ER

599
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,163
is that I am, I'm in charge
of setting the schedules.

600
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,138
I've arranged for my father

601
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:03,260
to watch the kids for a couple of days,

602
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,480
you can finish your field
work at the cottage.

603
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,667
And I very well may join you.

604
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:13,442
(gentle piano music)

605
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,659
(laptop beeping)

606
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:22,326
(ominous music)

607
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,520
- So just think of them as
all once little caterpillars.

608
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,547
Yeah, it's easy to remember, isn't it?

609
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:46,490
- I think so, yeah.

610
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,323
- What else do you have?

611
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,420
Any comprehension?
(telephone ringing)

612
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,337
- I got it.

613
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,050
Hello?

614
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,439
Yeah, uh-huh.

615
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,439
Here she is.

616
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,486
Mom.
- Yeah?

617
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:01,980
- There's the lady named Finn for you.

618
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,813
- Thank you.

619
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,261
I'll be right back.

620
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,892
- [Finn] Hello?

621
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:10,106
Hello?

622
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,040
- What do you want?

623
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,370
- Hey Beth, was that
Sean I was talking to?

624
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,750
He sounds adorable.

625
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,070
- Just leave my family out of this.

626
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,030
What do you want?

627
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,650
- Oh Beth, stop overreacting.

628
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,710
I mean, calling you at home

629
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,900
is the only way I can talk to you

630
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,010
if you don't answer my emails.

631
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,670
Unless, of course, you want
me popping in at the hospital.

632
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,473
- Look, that's not an option.

633
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,178
- Why won't you talk to me?

634
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:34,900
I thought we were friends.

635
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,040
- Look.

636
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,450
This whole thing was just a mis...

637
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,930
- It was a mistake?

638
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,063
- A misunderstanding.

639
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:46,170
Now, I am sorry if I hurt you in any way,

640
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,023
but I have my family to worry about.

641
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,220
- I'm aware of that Beth.

642
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,623
More than you know.

643
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:58,504
(phone dial tone)

644
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,350
- You're okay, mom?

645
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,967
- Yeah.

646
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,480
Yeah, everything's fine, come on.

647
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,339
Let's go finish up.

648
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,339
(suspenseful music)

649
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,409
- Paris Hilton,

650
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:19,290
eat your heart out.

651
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,290
(suspenseful music)

652
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,268
- Say hi, Beth.

653
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,293
She's a little out of it right now.

654
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,743
Yeah, she's pretty wasted.

655
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,320
Didn't stop her before, though (giggles),

656
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,333
did it?

657
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,166
Oh no.

658
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,053
She gave me a run for my money.

659
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:32,446
Oh.

660
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,090
Oh God, oh Beth.

661
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,980
(Finn giggles)

662
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,830
Yeah, you like it like that?

663
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,680
- [Beth] Oh yeah.

664
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,490
- [Finn] Mm, it tastes good.

665
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,323
- Sir.

666
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,690
- This is Dr. Kim and Dr. Soo from Seoul.

667
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,590
- I just need a moment to, um...

668
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,123
clean up my desk.

669
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,420
- I think that's a good idea.

670
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,350
Dr. Wyatt will join us shortly.

671
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,183
Just go down the hall.

672
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:16,995
Beth.

673
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,590
I am beyond shocked.

674
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,830
I didn't think internet
pornography was your style.

675
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,552
- Sir, someone sent it to me as a joke.

676
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,385
It's not what you think.

677
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,480
- Even so, you better be careful.

678
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,200
Attachments can carry viruses.

679
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,400
- Yes, sir.

680
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,680
- Now I'll try to explain
to our distinguished guests

681
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,950
that our new head of ER,

682
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,910
who was hired for her
high moral principles,

683
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,260
does not normally watch
pornography on the job.

684
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,640
- Thank you, sir.

685
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:46,190
- You'll be in good hands with Dr. Wyatt.

686
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,400
She'll show you a thing or two,

687
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,570
she has a wide variety of experience.

688
00:38:51,856 --> 00:38:52,689
- Please.

689
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:05,409
(dramatic music)

690
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:15,558
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

691
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:18,308
(dramatic music)

692
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:22,822
It should be here, come on.

693
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,514
It's gotta be here.

694
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:29,514
(dramatic music)
(laptop beeping)

695
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:15,784
(laptop thudding)

696
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,935
(dramatic music)

697
00:40:17,935 --> 00:40:21,018
(dialog box beeping)

698
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:28,095
(hands pounding on keyboard)

699
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:32,910
Can you send this to
radiology for me, please?

700
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,500
- Mm-hmm.

701
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,670
Hey, I noticed on the schedule
you're taking some time off.

702
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,503
- Yeah.

703
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:39,440
- Chief dragging you to the
West Coast Medical Conference?

704
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,850
- No, no, I'm gonna head up
north to our cottage with Jake.

705
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,910
- Oh, good for you.

706
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,020
Nice to see that you're
relaxing into the new job.

707
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,480
You were pretty tense there
for the past few weeks.

708
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,463
I'd venture to say downright fatigued?

709
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:54,520
- So nice of you to notice.

710
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,420
I just...

711
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,583
I just thought that something
terrible might happen.

712
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,183
But it hasn't.

713
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:04,520
- Got a severe abdominal
bleed, taking him to trauma I.

714
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,410
- Just the normal insanity.

715
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:16,391
(camera clicking)
(suspenseful music)

716
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:07,615
- [Finn] And you know your mom,

717
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:11,070
and she turned around and
she handed the guy her exam.

718
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,330
- [Terri] She did not.
(children giggling)

719
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,290
- [Finn] She did.

720
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,157
She said, "If you're gonna
copy my answers, here,

721
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,360
"I may as well give 'em to you."

722
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,170
- [Terri] And then what happened?

723
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,560
- [Finn] Oh, then the professor came over

724
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,043
and took both of their exams.

725
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,050
Do you know that that guy

726
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,150
copied every single answer
your mom had written?

727
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,110
Even the ones that she deliberately mixed

728
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,460
just to fake him out.

729
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,300
- See, I would've made
'em both retake the exam,

730
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,790
staying on opposite sides of the room.

731
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,683
- Hey mom.

732
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:35,990
- Hey babe.

733
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,440
How come you never told us this story?

734
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,730
It's hilarious.

735
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,830
- Is that why you say
cheaters never prosper?

736
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,690
- I think she says that because it's true.

737
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,840
Isn't that right, Beth?

738
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,470
Hey roomie.

739
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,973
It's been a long time.

740
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:55,770
(Finn giggles)

741
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,910
Your mom and I were known

742
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,423
as the Laverne and Shirley of Murphy dorm.

743
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,923
- Who are Laverne and Shirley?

744
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,271
- What are you doing here?

745
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:08,050
- Well, I figured it was
about time I looked you up,

746
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,050
and Jake was kind enough
to invite me for dinner,

747
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,993
so the least I could do was cook it.

748
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,940
- Oh wait, I offered to babysit

749
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,630
so the two of you could
have a girls night out,

750
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,210
but she was determined to
cook us a family dinner.

751
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,900
- Well, that's really not necessary.

752
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,863
- Oh, I insist.

753
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:28,100
And you know how to determined I can be.

754
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,010
Hey Terri, can I make
you head table setter?

755
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,843
- Yes.

756
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,580
- What about me?

757
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,080
- Hmm, I'm gonna make you
assistant head table setter.

758
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,933
Hop to it.

759
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:46,101
- [Sean] Who are Laverne and Shirley?

760
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,570
- What great kids you guys have.

761
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,403
- Thanks.

762
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,744
We think so.

763
00:43:54,744 --> 00:43:57,411
(ominous music)

764
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,843
- What's the matter, Beth?

765
00:44:03,843 --> 00:44:05,690
You don't like the food?

766
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,830
- I guess I'm just not that hungry.

767
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,960
- Don't know what you're missing, honey.

768
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,610
- Yeah, it's really good mom.

769
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,840
- I'm sure.

770
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,190
- I'm having seconds.

771
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,890
- Whoa, easy there, cowboy.

772
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,354
Save some for the other ranch hands.

773
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:22,291
- (giggles) You're funny.

774
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,250
Hey Finn, you wanna watch me play soccer?

775
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,870
We have a game on Saturday.

776
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,430
- Yeah, sure.

777
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,433
I'd love to.

778
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,520
I mean, if that's okay with you guys.

779
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,330
- Oh, well I don't know if...

780
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,350
- Hey, we can always use another person

781
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,453
rooting for our side.

782
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,600
Just be ready to sit
around outside for hours

783
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,410
watching a mob of screaming 7-year-olds

784
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,490
attempting to kick a ball.

785
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,943
- I am so there.

786
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,443
- Well,

787
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,458
it was real nice meeting you, Finn.

788
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,250
- You don't get off that easy,
come here, you (giggles).

789
00:44:59,193 --> 00:45:01,453
Oh, you're lucky you met him first, Beth.

790
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,310
- Honey, could I have a
word with Finn, please?

791
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,970
- Uh-oh, here comes the girl talk.

792
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:08,803
I'm outta here.

793
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,170
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

794
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,690
- I can't believe you did this.

795
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,523
Now I want you to get
the hell out of my house

796
00:45:14,523 --> 00:45:16,510
and don't you ever come
near my family again

797
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,650
or so help me, God, I will...

798
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,003
- Oh, you better bring it way down, Beth.

799
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,210
And you better get used to
seeing me around your family,

800
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,760
because if you don't,

801
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,110
they might get a copy of
our little home movie.

802
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Not exactly G-rated for the kiddies,

803
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,670
but I have a feeling
Jake's gonna like watching

804
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,393
some girl-on-girl action.

805
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:39,400
Oh, we're gonna be friends, you and me,

806
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,623
best friends,

807
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,260
or everyone on the board of trustees

808
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,410
at St. Catherine's might find
a little something special

809
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,780
in their mailbox.

810
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,693
You understand?

811
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,832
So if I wanna go to a soccer
game, you don't get to say no.

812
00:45:53,832 --> 00:45:55,165
- And then what?

813
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,613
Set a place for you at Christmas dinner?

814
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,500
Look, you can hurt me all you want,

815
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,900
just leave my family out of it.

816
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,250
- You don't get it, do you?

817
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,163
God Beth, I don't wanna hurt you.

818
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,620
I wanna be a part of you.

819
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,883
A part of your family.

820
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,580
Since my partner died,

821
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,470
I've just been so removed and lonely

822
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,833
and I just need to feel again,

823
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,483
even if that means going
to a kid's soccer game.

824
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,280
- You, you sound like you're going

825
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,960
through survivor's guilt, Finn.

826
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,410
It's affecting your judgment.

827
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,090
I can recommend a psychologist.

828
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,340
I could help you...
- No.

829
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:43,433
Thank you, doctor.

830
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,753
I am just fine.

831
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,167
I'll see you Saturday.

832
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:55,860
(lips smacking)

833
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:00,718
(door thudding)

834
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,480
- Come on, tell me what's the
matter between you and Finn?

835
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,500
- Nothing's the matter.

836
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,830
- Please, your reception of
her was lukewarm at best.

837
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,653
Some might call it downright frosty.

838
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,840
- Just surprised to see her, that's all.

839
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,887
- Beth, Finn told me that you two

840
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:31,920
had a little falling out of college

841
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,620
and that it had been quite
some time since you talked.

842
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,000
She assumed it was water under
the bridge, was she right?

843
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,803
- Did she say what this
falling out was about?

844
00:47:43,803 --> 00:47:45,520
- She said it was up to you to tell me.

845
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,253
- Huh, isn't that gracious of her.

846
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,740
- Well, you don't have to tell me,

847
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,950
but I just figured after
14 years of marriage,

848
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,550
we didn't have any more secrets.

849
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:00,897
(Beth sighs)

850
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:05,370
- It was...

851
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,203
- It was what?

852
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,733
- It was a long time ago.

853
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,713
- Fine, don't tell me.

854
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,450
Just have to go with my own theory,

855
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,050
which was that she stole
your boyfriend in college

856
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,110
and that I should thank her

857
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,213
for keeping you away from the wrong guy.

858
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:34,392
- Jake.

859
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:36,410
Honey.

860
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:40,030
(Beth sighs)

861
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,180
The thing with Finn is,

862
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,170
she's just...

863
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,563
Unreliable,

864
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:50,700
and maybe it's not such a good idea

865
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,193
for the kids to get too attached to her.

866
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,860
- Right, 'cause it would be bad

867
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,533
if the kids got attached to
someone they could depend on.

868
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,653
- Gosh, wow.

869
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,430
So we're back at this again.

870
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,263
Look, I'm sorry,

871
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:06,250
I thought I was doing
everything I could to try to...

872
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,563
- Honey, no, no, you are.

873
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:09,983
I know you are.

874
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,220
I'm sorry.

875
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,017
(soft piano music)

876
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:16,850
Okay?

877
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:19,475
Come here.

878
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:22,392
(soft piano music)

879
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:38,264
- Come here, I love you (grunts).

880
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:39,334
(Beth giggles)

881
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:41,220
(telephone ringing)

882
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,500
- Hey Sarah, I'm gonna
take off for the day,

883
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,770
I've got my son's soccer game,

884
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,630
So I am gonna see you tomorrow, my dear.

885
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,993
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

886
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,100
- ER.

887
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,020
How many?

888
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,540
Dr. Wyatt?

889
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,373
We'll be ready.

890
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:58,460
Dr. Wyatt, a bus
overturned on Interstate 5.

891
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,410
- Prep the trauma room,
set up a triage area,

892
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,460
call on everyone.

893
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,360
It's code red.

894
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,193
- I'm on it.

895
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:07,238
- [PA Announcer] Dr.
Truit, nurse station five.

896
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:13,000
- But the mall's not that
far, you can just drop me off.

897
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,450
Amanda and Jenny are gonna be there.

898
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,980
- Yeah, and I suppose you want 20 bucks

899
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,510
and a ride home too.

900
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,380
- Well, yeah.

901
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,920
- Then that would have to be a no.

902
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,790
- But dad...

903
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:21,623
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

904
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:24,960
Oh, hold that pout.
(cell phone ringing)

905
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,793
Hey.

906
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:27,230
- Hi, um...

907
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:31,373
there's been a busload of
patients that are gonna come in.

908
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,810
Tell Sean I'm gonna do
my very best to get there

909
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,180
as soon as I can, but I...

910
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,503
- But you don't know if
you'll make it out on time.

911
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,917
Yeah, I'll tell him.

912
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,973
- Right, and would you tell
him that I love him too?

913
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,730
- Yeah, of course.

914
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,953
- Is Finn there?

915
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,823
- No, no, I haven't seen her.

916
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,400
- Well, maybe she changed her mind.

917
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
- Well, you had said she was unreliable.

918
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,700
- Listen, I gotta go.

919
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,273
I'll talk to you later, I love you.

920
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:04,811
- Love you too.

921
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,293
Hey, Sean.

922
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,520
That was mom on the phone.

923
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,530
There's been a big accident,

924
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,310
she has to stay at the
hospital to help out,

925
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,910
but she's really, really
gonna try and get here

926
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,410
as soon as she can, all right?

927
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,320
And she wants you to know she
loves you very much, okay?

928
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,570
- Sure.

929
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,876
- Hey, there's my star soccer player.

930
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:27,910
- Finn!

931
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,820
- Hey.

932
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,110
- Come on, I'll show you
the good place to sit.

933
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:32,083
- Okay.

934
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,100
Hey, where's Beth?

935
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,150
- Caught up at work.

936
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,523
- Oh, that's too bad.

937
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,140
- There's Kylie and her
mom, can I go sit with them?

938
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,610
- Yeah, okay.

939
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,343
Just stay inside the park, okay?

940
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,470
- So Jake, I'm curious.

941
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,920
How did you and Beth meet?

942
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,470
- We were at a wedding.

943
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,790
We were at the singles table

944
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,390
and Beth knew the bride from med school

945
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,360
and the groom was a, well,

946
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,440
he is a colleague of mine.

947
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,223
Unfortunately, that couple just split up.

948
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,113
- Hmm, and how about you and Beth?

949
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,857
I mean, was it love at first sight?

950
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:21,973
- (chuckles) Ah, not exactly.

951
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,350
She was still doing a
residency, so she wasn't dating.

952
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,150
So it took a lot of persistence on my part

953
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,060
and a lot of rescheduling dates.

954
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,370
- Yeah, it must be hard

955
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,003
knowing that you always
come second to her career.

956
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,550
- Oh, it's not her
career that comes first.

957
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,270
She just has this,

958
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,643
this need to help everybody.

959
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,843
And I can't really resent
that, I mean, it's,

960
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:53,293
it's what attracted me to
her in the first place.

961
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,023
- Hmm.

962
00:52:57,513 --> 00:52:59,363
- What was that about?

963
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,040
- I don't know, it just sounds to me

964
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,240
like you get a little jealous

965
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,380
when she gives to other
people and not to you?

966
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,213
- Yeah.

967
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,183
Makes me a first-class jerk, huh?

968
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:13,763
- (chuckles) No, it just makes you human.

969
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,993
So how about you and your work?

970
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:22,320
I mean, that must be important too.

971
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,910
- Oh, environmental studies.

972
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,023
Forestry management.

973
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,380
- When I was young, my family and I,

974
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,890
we used to go camping up
north near Placid Pines.

975
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,723
- Really?

976
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:35,143
- Yeah, before they
started all the excavation.

977
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,835
- We have a cottage up near there.

978
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:39,930
- (chuckles) You're kidding me.

979
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,560
- No, seriously, and in fact,

980
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,573
our house overlooks
that excavation project.

981
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,390
Monstrosity.

982
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,020
- Hey, I have, um, I have strawberries.

983
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,417
You want one?

984
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:52,873
I have whipped cream too.

985
00:53:52,873 --> 00:53:53,734
(whistle blowing)

986
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,030
- [Sean] Dad!

987
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,180
- Sean!

988
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,040
(ominous music)

989
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,750
- [Man] Just, guys, just back over, okay?

990
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,583
- What happened?

991
00:54:00,432 --> 00:54:01,715
- [Boy] Is he bleeding?
(Sean weeping)

992
00:54:01,715 --> 00:54:03,470
- [Finn] Sean!

993
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,110
- Sean, what happened, buddy?

994
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,606
You're okay?
- My arm.

995
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:07,910
Ow, it hurts.
- Okay Sean, you just lie

996
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:09,934
still for me, okay?

997
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:10,767
- Ow!

998
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:12,212
- Can you wiggle your fingers for me?

999
00:54:12,212 --> 00:54:13,090
- Ow, ow!
- It's all right.

1000
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,300
- It's all right, stay still.
- Okay, sweetie.

1001
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,620
I think it might be broken.

1002
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,550
He's gonna need an X-ray.

1003
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,668
- It's all right.
- I'll get you fixed up

1004
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:20,880
in a jiffy.
(Sean grunting painfully)

1005
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,713
- It's okay, Sean.

1006
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:23,650
- Dr. Wyatt, your son's been admitted.

1007
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,310
Trauma II.
- What?

1008
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,160
- I'll take over.

1009
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,690
You're gonna be just fine.

1010
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,177
- And then the blind man says, "No thanks,

1011
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:34,170
"I'm just looking around."

1012
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,900
(Sean and Beth giggling)

1013
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,010
- Hey, mom.

1014
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,510
- Hey sweetie.

1015
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,570
- I broke my arm.

1016
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,514
- Yeah, you did, you okay?

1017
00:54:42,514 --> 00:54:43,347
- You would've been proud of him, Beth,

1018
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:44,363
he was a real trooper.

1019
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:45,196
- Was he?

1020
00:54:45,196 --> 00:54:46,029
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

1021
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:47,710
- Glad you could join us, Dr. Wyatt.

1022
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,000
- I came as soon as I heard.

1023
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,680
- Well, it's definitely a
fracture, but he's young,

1024
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,170
it should heal without complication.

1025
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,320
You did a good job of splinting it.

1026
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,420
- Hmm, thank you.

1027
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,253
- You did it?

1028
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,330
- Mm-hmm.

1029
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,320
- Finn stayed calm and
took control the situation,

1030
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,720
which makes her a hero in my book

1031
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,780
'cause I was a basket case.

1032
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,580
- Yeah mom, Finn was cool.

1033
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,413
- Was?

1034
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:08,950
- I just did what I was trained to do.

1035
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,623
You would've done the same
thing, if you'd been there.

1036
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,580
- Well, then I'm grateful
that you were there.

1037
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,430
- All right Sean, let's get
you fixed up and out of here.

1038
00:55:21,971 --> 00:55:23,271
- Okay, you're good to go.

1039
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,260
- I'll call Kylie's mom

1040
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,838
and see if Terri can stay the night.

1041
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:33,671
- Sure.

1042
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,850
- Hey.

1043
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,505
You know I wanted to be there.

1044
00:55:39,505 --> 00:55:40,905
- This isn't the time, Beth.

1045
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,030
- But you know that, right?

1046
00:55:44,982 --> 00:55:48,232
(solemn ambient music)

1047
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:50,975
- Where's Finn?

1048
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,891
- She couldn't wait around at
the hospital forever, kiddo.

1049
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:57,192
- Will she be here tomorrow?

1050
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:59,144
- I'm pretty sure that could be arranged.

1051
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:00,624
- Good.

1052
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:03,874
(solemn ambient music)

1053
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:14,530
(telephone buttons beeping)

1054
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,030
- Hi, it's Beth Wyatt.

1055
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,120
Oh, he's much better, thanks.

1056
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,670
Listen, I was wondering, ah,

1057
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,643
could Terri stay with Carly tonight?

1058
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:25,564
What?

1059
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,693
What do you mean she left?

1060
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,147
With who?

1061
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:34,874
(suspenseful music)

1062
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:36,574
And, and, and you just let her go?

1063
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,286
Well, did Finn happen to mention
where she was taking her?

1064
00:56:41,286 --> 00:56:44,286
(suspenseful music)

1065
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:49,697
Well, they'd better be home.

1066
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,697
(suspenseful music)

1067
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,313
Yes, hi,

1068
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,860
I would like you to put
up an AMBER Alert for my,

1069
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,693
for my daughter.

1070
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,503
Terri Wyatt.

1071
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,610
It's somebody, somebody took her

1072
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,180
and, and, and I don't know where.

1073
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,010
No, this isn't a custody dispute.

1074
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,246
Her name, a woman, Finn
Connors took my daughter...

1075
00:57:14,246 --> 00:57:15,480
- What, what's going on?

1076
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,470
- Finn picked up Terri from Kylie's house.

1077
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:18,303
40 minutes ago.

1078
00:57:18,303 --> 00:57:19,136
- Well, what are you talking about?

1079
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,950
- It only takes 10 minutes
to get here from her house.

1080
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:21,790
- Maybe they stopped.

1081
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:24,100
- Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what?

1082
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,320
Dr. Beth Wyatt.

1083
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,933
1119 Sapphire Lane.

1084
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,350
What was Terri wearing today?

1085
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,630
- Black hoodie, khaki pants, pink T-shirt.

1086
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,500
Why, why, why would Finn take Terri?

1087
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,150
- Because she wants to punish me.

1088
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:40,530
She's 11 years old, she has
long brown hair, brown eyes,

1089
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,600
she weighs about...

1090
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,210
Where have you been?

1091
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,930
Why did you leave Kylie's house?

1092
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,143
- Well Finn came over and
I wanted to come home.

1093
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:49,350
- Haven't I told you to never go anywhere

1094
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,670
without telling me first?

1095
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,080
- I know, but it was Finn.

1096
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,840
- I don't care who it was,

1097
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,890
you don't go anywhere with anyone,

1098
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,110
even if it's someone that you know,

1099
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,670
unless your father or
I know about it first,

1100
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:00,623
and you know that.

1101
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,560
Why didn't you come home right away?

1102
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,393
Where did you go?

1103
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:05,226
What, what did she do to you?

1104
00:58:05,226 --> 00:58:06,150
- Oh come on, Beth.

1105
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,653
- We just got ice cream.

1106
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,860
- Sorry, I was just...

1107
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,990
just so worried about you, honey.

1108
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,790
I just want you to be safe.

1109
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,180
Sorry I yelled at you.

1110
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,970
- Hi, yeah, sorry about that.

1111
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,143
Ever, everything's fine, she's home.

1112
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,660
Okay, yeah, thanks for your time.

1113
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,113
Hey.

1114
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,613
Why don't you go wash up and
then we'll have some ice cream.

1115
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,760
One of you two is gonna tell me

1116
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,173
what the hell is going on here.

1117
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,170
- (sigh) Look, I'm sorry
if I stepped out of bounds.

1118
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,419
I just, I knew you guys
were preoccupied with Sean

1119
00:58:57,419 --> 00:59:00,290
and I just thought Terri
could use a little attention.

1120
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,210
- Jake already had someone we knew

1121
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,317
and trusted watching Terri, thank you.

1122
00:59:04,317 --> 00:59:06,580
You're just trying to get
to me through my kids.

1123
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,413
- Enough!

1124
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,270
I wanna know what the hell this
bad blood is between you two

1125
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,143
'cause this has gotta stop now.

1126
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,740
Nothing could be that bad.

1127
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:19,284
- Oh yes it can.

1128
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:22,683
- Okay.

1129
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,980
If you can't or don't wanna tell me,

1130
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,130
I have to respect that.

1131
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,683
Finn, I'm sorry,

1132
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:32,130
but you're no longer
welcomed in this house.

1133
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:34,785
I can't have this hostility
in my home anymore.

1134
00:59:34,785 --> 00:59:36,170
- [Sean] Dad.

1135
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,090
- Look, I hate ending things like this,

1136
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,090
but if you two can't work this out,

1137
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,590
I have to put my family first.

1138
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,760
- I understand, Jake.

1139
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,667
(ominous music)

1140
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,803
Why did you go, go and ruin everything?

1141
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,510
It was all going so well.

1142
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,780
I was even bonding with the kids.

1143
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,930
- You heard my husband.

1144
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,210
You're no longer welcomed in this house.

1145
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,310
- Well then get him to change his mind

1146
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,890
or I'm gonna post our
little sex video on YouTube

1147
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,190
and email it to everyone
in your address book.

1148
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,260
You better wrap your head around that

1149
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,817
'cause you've got 48 hours
until your world premiere.

1150
01:00:27,817 --> 01:00:30,484
(ominous music)

1151
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:56,050
- [Sarah] We need security.
(objects clattering)

1152
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:57,830
- I don't have the right insurance.

1153
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:01,000
- Sir, if you will just
calm down, I will help you.

1154
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,664
- You want coverage, huh?

1155
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:03,935
- Please, sir.
(medical items clattering)

1156
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:05,220
- I'll give you coverage.

1157
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,140
- [Sarah] Please, calm down, sir.

1158
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,280
- What the hell is going on?

1159
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,965
- Sir, calm down.
- Another HMO patient.

1160
01:01:10,965 --> 01:01:15,965
(objects clattering)
(men grunting)

1161
01:01:16,936 --> 01:01:20,149
- Hey!
(Dr. Friedman grunting)

1162
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:22,960
- Oh, it's my back.
- Sir.

1163
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,910
- Here, help me up.

1164
01:01:24,826 --> 01:01:27,044
(Dr. Friedman grunting)

1165
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:28,020
- Do you have pain in your legs too?

1166
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,640
- Yes.

1167
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,170
- All right, bring that gurney over here.

1168
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,340
- No, no, no, it's all right.

1169
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,060
I'll, I'll, we'll just ice it up.

1170
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,240
- Yeah, we'll just get you over to X-ray

1171
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,610
and then we will see about that ice.

1172
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,893
All right, easy, easy.

1173
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,850
- Keep your head up this end.

1174
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,080
- I hope you're happy.

1175
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,560
Spinal stenosis exacerbated by a man

1176
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,960
throwing me across the room.

1177
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,043
Damn bone spurs digging
into my spinal column.

1178
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,410
Do you know what this means?

1179
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,821
- That you're gonna miss your yoga class?

1180
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:00,670
(Dr. Friedman chuckles)

1181
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,010
- So Beth, I'm gonna be out
of commission for a few weeks,

1182
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,120
I'm gonna need you to step up.

1183
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,780
- Absolutely, anything you need.

1184
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,070
- I'm scheduled to be at the West Coast

1185
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:09,770
Medical Conference tomorrow.

1186
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,370
I'm gonna need someone to
go to Seattle in my place.

1187
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:15,650
- Tomorrow.

1188
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,780
- I know you had cleared your calendar

1189
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,560
so you could spend some time
at the cottage with Jake,

1190
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,810
but I'm slated to give the keynote address

1191
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:24,160
on morals and medical ethics,

1192
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,040
I need someone I can trust to take over.

1193
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,880
- Look sir, I appreciate
your faith in me, but I...

1194
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,910
- Good, good, since you have no objection,

1195
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,000
then I'll tell the organizers

1196
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,410
that you will be
representing St Catherine's.

1197
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,860
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1198
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:41,388
(Beth sighs)

1199
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,006
- Exciting morning in the ER.

1200
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:49,150
- (sigh) Yeah.

1201
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,150
- Sorry I missed it.

1202
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,970
How's your son doing?

1203
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:55,651
- Much better, thank you.

1204
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,803
- Your friend Finn,

1205
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,960
or is she Jake's friend?

1206
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,030
Not actually sure.
- No, actually she's,

1207
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,780
she's just an acquaintance, really.

1208
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,030
- Doyle was saying that
she used to be a paramedic

1209
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,330
over at Westfield General.

1210
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,610
- Yeah, that's right.

1211
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,580
- I told a friend of
mine who works over there

1212
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,930
about how she was at the
right place at the right time,

1213
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,393
helped your son out and...

1214
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:19,990
Well the thing is is that,

1215
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,530
she, um...

1216
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,660
- What is it, Massey?

1217
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,000
- He's been working there for six years.

1218
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,950
He says he's never heard of a
paramedic named Finn Connors.

1219
01:03:35,788 --> 01:03:37,400
- Are you sure?

1220
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,400
- Yeah, this guy's solid.

1221
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,979
(suspenseful music)

1222
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:44,850
- Well, it must be some misunderstanding.

1223
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,330
- Right, right.

1224
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,163
- Right.

1225
01:03:47,163 --> 01:03:49,920
- She must work at like
Valley General or something.

1226
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,813
I just thought you should know.

1227
01:03:51,813 --> 01:03:53,080
(pager buzzing)

1228
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:53,913
Gotta go.

1229
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:57,849
(suspenseful music)

1230
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,837
(cell phone buttons beeping)

1231
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,993
- Hi, it's Beth Wyatt.

1232
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,520
Yes, yes, I can imagine that you are

1233
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,120
surprised to hear from me but...

1234
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:24,773
Listen, I was wondering if you
could meet for lunch today.

1235
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,540
It's important that we talk.

1236
01:04:37,851 --> 01:04:38,960
Hey.
- Hey.

1237
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,410
- Thank you so much for meeting
me on such short notice.

1238
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,230
- Everything's okay with my mom, right?

1239
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,820
- Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1240
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,355
She's healing beautifully.

1241
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:49,380
- Good, you had me worried
there for a sec, doc.

1242
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,213
- I'm sorry.

1243
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:55,220
The reason why I called, Jamie, is...

1244
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:01,250
Well, I've got sort of a computer problem.

1245
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:04,970
- Ah, well it's about time
that I get to help you,

1246
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,740
what's the problem?

1247
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,300
- Well, you see, I belong to one of these

1248
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,300
professional forums online,

1249
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,200
a message board for emergency
room doctors and nurses,

1250
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,100
and well, I think there's someone on it

1251
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,130
that isn't who they
say they are, and well,

1252
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,680
I was wondering if,

1253
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,990
if they give false
information on their profile,

1254
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:27,354
like if there was a way to
find out who they really are.

1255
01:05:27,354 --> 01:05:29,130
You know, like, you know,

1256
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,963
if there was a way somehow
to trace the account.

1257
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,170
- Yeah, just ask the
webmaster of the forum

1258
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,833
for the IP address of the person.

1259
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,353
- What does that do?

1260
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,513
- Ah, the IP address will
track down their server.

1261
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,110
- What if you wanna track down the person?

1262
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,340
- Oh, that's a little more complicated.

1263
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,817
You'd have to hack into their computer.

1264
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:55,650
- Ah.

1265
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,053
Can you do that?

1266
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:06,570
- I could, but it would
be, you know, illegal.

1267
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,190
Just start with the webmaster,

1268
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:11,006
get him to ban the person from the forum.

1269
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:14,220
- Well, you see, Jamie, the truth is...

1270
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:20,283
this person has been
harassing me and my family.

1271
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,072
All I have is her name.

1272
01:06:27,072 --> 01:06:29,670
It's the screen name on the
account that was canceled,

1273
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,513
and her address.

1274
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:35,990
Now I may have helped your mother,

1275
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:37,970
I have no right to ask you
to do anything illegal,

1276
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,300
so if you just wanna leave right now,

1277
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,703
I will totally understand.

1278
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,283
But if you do do this,

1279
01:06:48,652 --> 01:06:51,230
you will find some things out about me,

1280
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:54,943
some things that I'm not
particularly proud of,

1281
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:59,420
which is the reason why
I can't go to the police.

1282
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,083
- Doc,

1283
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,970
you may be my family's guardian angel,

1284
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:11,263
but I'm sure you're still human.

1285
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,143
So, are the burgers here any good?

1286
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:31,390
- Hello?

1287
01:07:34,492 --> 01:07:36,450
- Hey.
- Hi.

1288
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,860
Where's everybody?

1289
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,270
- Kids are upstairs packing

1290
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,763
and off to grandpa's they go.

1291
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,020
What's the matter now?

1292
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,413
- Friedman has to have back surgery.

1293
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:52,320
I need to fill in for him at
a conference in Seattle...

1294
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,053
Tomorrow.

1295
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:57,903
- Damn it, Beth.

1296
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,440
We had it all planned.

1297
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,577
- I know, I know, I know,

1298
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,650
and I'm just as upset
about this as you are,

1299
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,850
but I'm sure I can sneak
away early on the last day

1300
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:07,683
and come meet you.

1301
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,610
- That's not good enough, Beth.

1302
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,310
Your dad's coming to
pick up the kids tonight.

1303
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:15,520
- I know, and everything is
going to go according to plan,

1304
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,333
except for this one little revision.

1305
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:23,450
I promise I am not gonna let
this ruin our time together.

1306
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:24,350
I promise.

1307
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:26,259
(lips smacking)

1308
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:27,092
Promise.

1309
01:08:27,092 --> 01:08:30,175
(cell phone ringing)

1310
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,780
- Better get that.

1311
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:38,833
Probably the hospital.

1312
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,750
- Hello?

1313
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,843
- Tick-tock, Beth.

1314
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,730
24 hours are up.

1315
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,883
24 more and you'll be an internet legend,

1316
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,350
unless, of course, you
come to your senses.

1317
01:08:57,236 --> 01:08:59,860
- Look, I am not afraid of you.

1318
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:02,517
I know you never worked
for Westfield General

1319
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:05,220
and I'm gonna find out who you really are.

1320
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,283
- Tick-tock, Beth.

1321
01:09:11,862 --> 01:09:14,260
(cell phone ringing)

1322
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,093
- Hello?

1323
01:09:15,093 --> 01:09:16,420
- Hey Jamie, she just called.

1324
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,250
- I'm gonna access your phone records now.

1325
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,440
- She, she blocked the caller ID.

1326
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,970
- Nah, that's not a problem

1327
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,520
We'll get her, doc.

1328
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,353
I promise.

1329
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:28,740
- Okay.

1330
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,740
(suspenseful music)

1331
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,700
I will meet you at the
cottage after the conference.

1332
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,533
- Don't Beth.

1333
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:55,985
I don't have the energy for it anymore.

1334
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:57,320
- What?

1335
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,261
- Promises you can't keep.

1336
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,261
(suspenseful music)

1337
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:22,923
(people chattering)

1338
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:27,710
- Name, please.

1339
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,110
- Dr. Beth Wyatt.

1340
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,210
- Here you are, and I see
you're one of our speakers.

1341
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,043
- That's right.

1342
01:10:32,043 --> 01:10:34,660
- Morals and medical ethics, I believe.

1343
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,310
- Dr. Doyle.

1344
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:37,738
The chief didn't say that you'd be here.

1345
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:39,960
- Oh, I'm not the chosen
one, just a regular attendee.

1346
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,793
Dr. Brian Doyle.

1347
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,020
- There you are.

1348
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,853
- Pardon me.

1349
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:44,686
Dr. Wyatt.

1350
01:10:44,686 --> 01:10:48,650
I, I believe you left your
visual aid at the hospital.

1351
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:49,723
- You stole that from my office.

1352
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:51,340
- Look.

1353
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:54,823
Friedman told me you've been
watching porn on your computer.

1354
01:10:54,823 --> 01:10:57,240
I thought I could play a practical joke

1355
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,900
and CC it to the rest of the hospital.

1356
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,923
Petty, I know,

1357
01:11:00,845 --> 01:11:03,953
but I was pissed off about
you getting the promotion.

1358
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:07,400
But then I discovered
it was you on the DVD.

1359
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,023
- What are you gonna do with it?

1360
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,973
- Look.

1361
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:15,103
I'm not the complete
bastard that you think I am,

1362
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,470
and you're not what I thought either.

1363
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:22,580
So tell me, is this double
life tearing you apart inside

1364
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,140
or are you the most accomplished liar

1365
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,540
I've ever met?
- Brian, please.

1366
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,660
There's more to this than you know.

1367
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,450
- Oh, I'm sure there is.

1368
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,380
Now I'm going to listen to your speech

1369
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:33,010
on morals, medical ethics.

1370
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:38,010
If there is one iota of guile
or sanctimonious rubbish,

1371
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,820
I'm taking this to the board of trustees.

1372
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:46,921
(suspenseful music)

1373
01:11:59,724 --> 01:12:02,807
(cell phone ringing)

1374
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,750
- Do you have any news?

1375
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,283
- Good news or bad first?

1376
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,300
- Well, there's good news?

1377
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,510
- Yeah, I was finally able
to hack into her computer.

1378
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:16,110
Let me tell you, she sure knows
her way around a firewall.

1379
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,310
- And what did you find?

1380
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,320
- Doc, are you sure that you wanna know?

1381
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,153
- I have to.

1382
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,330
- I doubt you two meeting
online was by accident.

1383
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,280
A couple months before he
started chatting in the ER forum,

1384
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,600
she's been emailing your husband.

1385
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,901
- That's impossible.

1386
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:40,166
- Doc, I can forward you the emails.

1387
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,416
You can read them yourself.

1388
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,861
Doc?

1389
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:51,822
- Send me the emails.

1390
01:12:51,822 --> 01:12:54,822
(suspenseful music)

1391
01:12:56,148 --> 01:12:57,336
- Okay.

1392
01:12:57,336 --> 01:13:00,336
(suspenseful music)

1393
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:27,722
- [Finn] Yeah, does that feel good?

1394
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:31,685
You like that?

1395
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:34,984
- Whoa.

1396
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:48,099
- Yeah.

1397
01:13:49,787 --> 01:13:50,954
Oh yeah, baby.

1398
01:13:52,023 --> 01:13:55,023
(suspenseful music)

1399
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,580
Are you ready for me?

1400
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:08,540
Oh yeah, get your leg up here.

1401
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,343
Oh yeah.

1402
01:14:12,878 --> 01:14:13,711
Oh.

1403
01:14:14,996 --> 01:14:16,163
Yeah, oh yeah.

1404
01:14:20,654 --> 01:14:23,737
(cell phone ringing)

1405
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:28,983
- Jamie.

1406
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:31,210
- Hey, I've done more digging.

1407
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,840
Finn had an online
prescription for Rohypnol.

1408
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,040
That's the one they call roofies, right?

1409
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,490
The date rape drug?

1410
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:38,090
- That's the one.

1411
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,530
- She must have slipped
it to you at the bar

1412
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:41,040
because I've just seen the uncut footage

1413
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,440
of the video she shot.

1414
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,623
You were unconscious the whole time, doc.

1415
01:14:46,756 --> 01:14:50,290
- But, but the video had
me moving and I was...

1416
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,690
- Well, she must've edited
to make it look like,

1417
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,873
you know,

1418
01:14:56,004 --> 01:14:57,054
but nothing happened.

1419
01:14:58,177 --> 01:15:00,650
- Oh (sigh).

1420
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,633
Oh my God, Jamie, you have no
idea how grateful I am to you.

1421
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,970
- Doc, I also found more
bad news about Finn.

1422
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,090
- Tell me everything.

1423
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:13,700
(dramatic music)

1424
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,090
- Dr. Wyatt, we've been looking for you.

1425
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,970
The seminar you're speaking
at is right this way.

1426
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,130
- Right, you know what?

1427
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,500
I can't do this right now.

1428
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,993
- I've, I've got something, Brian, Brian.

1429
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,870
A sudden change of plans,

1430
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:28,215
Dr. Doyle here will be giving the speech.

1431
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:29,048
- What?

1432
01:15:29,048 --> 01:15:30,780
- My notes, if you want them,

1433
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:31,740
they should explain everything.

1434
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,460
If not, then just do what you need to do.

1435
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,293
Thanks.

1436
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:36,590
- Dr. Doyle, right this way.

1437
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:42,540
- [Beth VOICEOVER] Medical
ethics are concerned

1438
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,420
with our conduct as doctors,

1439
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,120
so does it really matter
what our personal morals are?

1440
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,650
As long as we save lives,

1441
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,160
does it matter if we lie or cheat

1442
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,110
when we're not wearing that white coat?

1443
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,840
- Just give me a second, please.

1444
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,673
- Sure.

1445
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,113
- [Beth VOICEOVER] As physicians,

1446
01:16:01,113 --> 01:16:02,810
we take the moral high ground by putting

1447
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,500
the welfare of our
patients above all else,

1448
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,300
but in our personal
lives, where do we stand?

1449
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,880
And that's where my speech ends, Brian.

1450
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,713
I couldn't write any more

1451
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:13,220
because we both know what a lie it is

1452
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,590
for me to lecture on morality.

1453
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,800
I can't undo what I've done,

1454
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,203
but it's time for me to
take a stand for my family,

1455
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,620
to fight for them,

1456
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,570
to let them know that
I'd give up everything

1457
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,230
to make it right.

1458
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:29,113
I'm afraid it's too late, but Brian,

1459
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:33,001
please give me a chance to save my family.

1460
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:35,751
(dramatic music)

1461
01:17:45,277 --> 01:17:46,517
- Hi, Jake.

1462
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:48,060
- Beth.

1463
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:51,509
You startled me, wha-what
are you doing here?

1464
01:17:51,509 --> 01:17:54,080
- I brought a peace offering.

1465
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,913
- Finn...

1466
01:17:55,752 --> 01:17:58,823
- Look, things didn't go
quite as I'd hoped with Beth,

1467
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,303
but I have a plan.

1468
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,753
And I also have some brisee, some pate,

1469
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:08,140
and a bottle of wine.

1470
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:11,113
- Finn, I, I don't really
think this is appropriate.

1471
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,313
- But, Jake, I could
really use some advice.

1472
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,750
- I'm really kinda busy here.

1473
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,870
You're not gonna take no
for an answer, are ya?

1474
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,360
- Isn't this better than looking

1475
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,733
at a big hole in the ground?

1476
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:37,120
- Oh, all right, I admit it.

1477
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,543
I needed the break.

1478
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,553
Ah, food, the food is delicious.

1479
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,453
- You should see what I can do

1480
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:47,533
when I really set my mind to something.

1481
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,523
- What are we gonna say to Beth?

1482
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:54,913
- Leave Beth to me, I'll take care of her.

1483
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,010
I'll take care of everything.

1484
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,200
- You are very persuasive.

1485
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,393
- That I am.

1486
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:05,803
- Whoa.

1487
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,990
What do you think you're doing?

1488
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:10,250
- Come on, Jake.

1489
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,423
Don't play so innocent.

1490
01:19:13,391 --> 01:19:16,443
The way we get along so well,
the chemistry between us.

1491
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:21,470
I mean, you must know this
isn't all of a sudden.

1492
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,370
- Whoa, whoa, wait just a minute here.

1493
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,390
I was, I was willing to help
you apologize for Beth's sake,

1494
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,690
but I didn't think that...

1495
01:19:32,129 --> 01:19:36,500
Look, if you think there's
something between us,

1496
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,333
you're crazy.

1497
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,923
- That's not what you said before.

1498
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,310
- What are you talking about?

1499
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:53,163
- You make me feel something
I haven't felt in a long time.

1500
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,720
I wonder what it would
be like to kiss you,

1501
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,413
to feel your body next to mine.

1502
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,107
- Where'd you get that?

1503
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:04,423
- You emailed it to me.

1504
01:20:05,588 --> 01:20:06,421
- What?

1505
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,253
- My name was Red Rock Girl,

1506
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,633
when we met on that online
chat room, remember?

1507
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:16,350
We talked about rock climbing,

1508
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,133
you told me all about your family,

1509
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,533
about Beth and the kids.

1510
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,240
How lost you were.

1511
01:20:25,433 --> 01:20:26,963
How your marriage was failing.

1512
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,500
How there was no more communication.

1513
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,373
No more sex.

1514
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,913
Jake, you told me how much
you wanted to touch me.

1515
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,523
Well, I'm here now, Jake.

1516
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,573
Touch me.

1517
01:20:46,573 --> 01:20:48,020
- Get away.

1518
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,880
I also said that I would
never go through with it

1519
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,303
because despite
everything, I love my wife.

1520
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:56,783
Finn, it's the internet, how
could you take that seriously?

1521
01:20:57,882 --> 01:21:00,860
I, I, I didn't even know your real name.

1522
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,470
I stopped emailing you.

1523
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,200
I canceled my account.

1524
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,253
- Which is why I had to go
through Beth to get to you.

1525
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,383
- Oh my God.

1526
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:14,350
- Jake, we could be our own
little perfect family now.

1527
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,203
That's all I've ever wanted.

1528
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,850
Beth won't be in the way anymore.

1529
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:22,432
- What do you mean?

1530
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:25,593
What do you mean?

1531
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,173
- Jake!

1532
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:34,250
Jake!

1533
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,380
- Hi Beth, I was just gonna tell Jake

1534
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,820
about our night together,

1535
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,920
or should I just show him the video?

1536
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,740
- I never knew Finn in college.

1537
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,200
- I kinda figured that out.

1538
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,160
- That night that I got drunk,

1539
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,230
she took me to her apartment

1540
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:48,544
and I woke up naked in her bed.

1541
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,630
- And you videotaped this?

1542
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,840
- Well she shot the video to
make me think that we had sex,

1543
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,240
but the truth is she
drugged me at the bar.

1544
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,970
- She's lying, Jake.

1545
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:57,440
She came onto me.

1546
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,930
- I found out more.

1547
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:00,280
You live off daddy's money,

1548
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:03,329
and you were never a paramedic.

1549
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,590
But you were in love with one in Spokane.

1550
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:09,073
He rejected you.

1551
01:22:09,073 --> 01:22:11,273
He even had a restraining
order against you.

1552
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,683
Then a year ago, he turned up dead.

1553
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:19,020
Gunshot wound to the head.

1554
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,720
They considered it suicide, but...

1555
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,410
maybe you did it.

1556
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,796
Maybe you drove him to it.

1557
01:22:26,796 --> 01:22:28,570
It's the only way he could be free of you.

1558
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:29,653
- He loved me.

1559
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,410
You bitch!

1560
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:34,760
- She had a mental breakdown after that,

1561
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,620
spent six months in a psych ward.

1562
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,900
She met you online

1563
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,000
a couple of months after she was released.

1564
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,083
- It's not true, Jake.

1565
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,083
He loved me,

1566
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:46,973
just like you.

1567
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,060
I know you will.

1568
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:52,540
- Oh.
(Finn weeping)

1569
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,550
What's happening?

1570
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:54,490
Is she having another breakdown?

1571
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:55,390
- Lemme check her.

1572
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:02,754
(Finn grunts)
(Beth screams)

1573
01:23:02,754 --> 01:23:06,150
- Get.
(women grunting)

1574
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:09,077
I needed an escape, all right?

1575
01:23:09,077 --> 01:23:11,190
And then I realized that my responsibility

1576
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:13,610
was to my wife and my kids,

1577
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,733
because I love Beth, more than anything.

1578
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:18,272
You got that?

1579
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:19,855
- Well sorry, Jake.

1580
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,753
- Let her go, Jake.

1581
01:23:27,426 --> 01:23:28,826
- We should call the police.

1582
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:34,778
- If you ever come near my family again,

1583
01:23:34,778 --> 01:23:35,978
we will call the police.

1584
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,713
- No.

1585
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,920
If you ever come anywhere
near my family again,

1586
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,970
I'll kill you myself.

1587
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:46,043
You understand?

1588
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,314
- I understand.

1589
01:23:52,838 --> 01:23:54,090
- Sorry, Beth.

1590
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:56,840
(dramatic music)

1591
01:24:14,994 --> 01:24:18,932
(engine revving)
(dramatic music)

1592
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:21,114
(car roaring)

1593
01:24:21,114 --> 01:24:21,947
- Beth!

1594
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:27,070
(body thudding on windshield)
(car roaring)

1595
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,259
- Beth!

1596
01:24:28,259 --> 01:24:31,009
(dramatic music)

1597
01:24:33,927 --> 01:24:34,760
(Beth grunts)

1598
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,818
Hang on, I'll get a rope.

1599
01:24:35,818 --> 01:24:39,028
- No, I can make it, I can
make it down, just call 911.

1600
01:24:39,028 --> 01:24:39,939
- What?

1601
01:24:39,939 --> 01:24:41,860
- I gotta help Finn out of the car.

1602
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:42,693
- Why?

1603
01:24:42,693 --> 01:24:44,138
- I'm still a doctor.

1604
01:24:44,138 --> 01:24:47,270
- Don't, don't, don't, don't do that.

1605
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:50,020
(dramatic music)

1606
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:03,690
Yeah, yeah, there's a car
that's gone over a cliff.

1607
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,620
12 Victoria, Placid Pines.

1608
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,330
Okay, yeah.

1609
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:10,080
(dramatic music)

1610
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:19,230
- Okay.
(Finn grunting)

1611
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:20,570
Hang on, hang on.

1612
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:22,120
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1613
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,027
(Finn grunting)

1614
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:32,798
- You have this thing about
helping people, don't you?

1615
01:25:32,798 --> 01:25:34,631
(car creaking)
(Finn grunting)

1616
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:35,964
Just let me die.

1617
01:25:37,326 --> 01:25:38,159
Just let me die.

1618
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:39,870
- You know I can't do that.

1619
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:43,678
(dramatic music)

1620
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:44,511
Jake!

1621
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:47,821
(car creaking)

1622
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:48,944
Help me get her outta here.

1623
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:50,443
- The car is sliding.

1624
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,503
- Come on.

1625
01:25:51,503 --> 01:25:52,947
- That's it.

1626
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,913
(car creaking)

1627
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:56,246
One, two, three.

1628
01:25:58,147 --> 01:26:02,273
(car creaking)
(rocks crumbling)

1629
01:26:02,273 --> 01:26:04,940
(Finn grunting)

1630
01:26:10,296 --> 01:26:13,349
(car thudding)

1631
01:26:13,349 --> 01:26:16,682
(car explosion booming)

1632
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:20,126
- That was close.

1633
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,507
- She's still breathing.

1634
01:26:27,507 --> 01:26:28,340
- Is she gonna live?

1635
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,711
- If medevac gets here soon.

1636
01:26:30,711 --> 01:26:33,711
(suspenseful music)

1637
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,980
- You know, Bethie,

1638
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:42,230
we really gotta work on
our communication skills.

1639
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:46,020
- Do you really think this is
the time to talk about this?

1640
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:46,853
- No.

1641
01:26:49,365 --> 01:26:51,503
I think I'll wait till
after I see that video.

1642
01:26:52,489 --> 01:26:55,599
- (giggles) Yeah.

1643
01:26:55,599 --> 01:26:58,266
(ominous music)
