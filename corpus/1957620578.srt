 think you are knocking

16
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,172
at this door in the
 middle of the night?

17
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,828
How did you get in here?

18
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:55,520
- I'm Anna.
 - What?

19
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,524
- I'm Anna Frankenstein.
I'm supposed to be-

20
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:02,285
- You're not supposed to be
 here until tomorrow afternoon.

21
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,874
We are not ready for you.
 - Yes, I know.

22
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,634
They put me on an earlier train.

23
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:10,259
- Well, it's a nuisance.
- I'm sorry.

 here. Don't go wandering off.

00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,007
- Victor?

30
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:38,597
- No.

31
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,876
[tense brooding music]

32
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:44,672

[door creaks shut]
 [footsteps shuffle]

35
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,652
- So you're my late
 brother's daughter?

36
00:03:58,652 --> 00:03:59,446
- Yes.

37
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,517
- So he and his wife manage

38
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,070
to get themselves
 killed in an accident.

39
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,314
Now I suppose I'm stuck
with you. Is that it?

40
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,007
- I'm sure they didn't mean
 to be an inconvenience.

41
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:15,151
- No, I'm sure they didn't.
 This is not just my home.

42
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:18,292
It's where I conduct my
work, my experiments.

43
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,399
When you're in the castle, you
 are to remain in your room.

44
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,160
You can go down to the
kitchen for your meals.

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,783
During the day, you can go
 out and romp in the woods

46
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:30,235
or do whatever it is
 that young girls do.

47
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:34,722
Do not wander around the
 castle, inside or outside.

48
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:37,277
This is my home. I
 want it respected.

49
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,831
Do you understand?
 - I think so.

50
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:42,523
I don't romp, though. [chuckles]

51
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,631
Do you have any books.
 - Books?

52
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,874
Do you mean you read?

53
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,844
- Yes, I read. Do
 you have any books?

54
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,639
- I have a library
 full of books,

55
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:58,470
but I can't have you
 wandering about in there.

56
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,887
I'll have Frau Herstner find
 you some children's books.

57
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,028
That's all. Take
 her away, Herstner.

58
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,306
[slow dramatic music]

59
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,272
- Yes, sir.

60
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,861
Come on.

[door shuts]

63
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:19,422
- That man coming out of my
 uncle's study, who was he?

64
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:20,872
- That's Herr Ludwig.

65
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:23,323
He help your uncle
 with his experiments.

66
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,740
You aren't to bother him.
 - What experiments?

67
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,982
- Beg your pardon?

68
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,088
- What exactly does my
 uncle experiment on?

69
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,297
- What business is
 that of yours or mine?

70
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,126
You ask a great many questions.

71
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,680
- Do I?

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,715
How am I supposed
 to learn anything

73
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,303
if I don't ask questions?

74
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,787
- You know, in a
 proper young lady,

75
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:44,171
curiosity is an extremely
 unattractive attribute,

76
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:46,518
something else we
 have to work on.

77
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,658
Here.

78
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,557
- Are there any
 other kids my age?

79
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,870
[door opens]
 [footsteps shuffle]

80

81
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,011
Never mind.

[dramatic music]
 [machinery clicks and whirs]

87
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:55,553
- Now pull the levers.

88
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,319
Elevate the frame.

89
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,047
[crank clicks]

90
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:25,962
It lives!

There's a pulse.

[heels clack]

93
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,009
- Stay here, eat your breakfast,

94
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,494
then go out and play, but
 not around the castle.

95
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,808
- Is there anyone else my age?

00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,535
[feet thud]
 [serveware clinks]

97
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:51,540
Hi. I'm Anna Frankenstein.
 Hi, I'm Anna.

98
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:56,890
Hi, I'm Anna Frankenstein.
 Hi, I'm Anna Frankenstein.

99
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,619
Hi, I'm Anna Frankenstein.

[feet thud]
 [soft dramatic music]

101
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,073
Hi, I'm George Frankenstein.

102
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,836
- Nice to meet you, George.

103
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,942
[footsteps shuffle]

104
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:19,188

[rooster crows]

107
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,583
[footsteps shuffle]

108
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,801
Hello again, George.
 - Oh, it's you.

109
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:49,183
My name's Anna.
 - Oh, I like that better.

110
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,840
Mine's Thomas.

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,912
Look, don't tell your uncle
 that I'm talking to you, okay?

112
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,327
- Why not?

113
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,433
- Maybe he's afraid
you'll find things out.

114
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,263
Any idea what that sound is?

115
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:01,748
- Like, find what things out?

116
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,959
- This shaft isn't part of
 the original construction.

117
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,961
It's only been here a few years.

118
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,032
They brought in workers
 all the way from Hildesheim

119
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,034
to build these shafts,
 do some other work

120
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,863
down in the basement
 of the castle.

121
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:17,522
Nobody knows what.
 - For my uncle's experiments?

122
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,249
- I suppose, some sort
 of mischief, anyway.

123
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,355
- What does he do down there?

124
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,184
- Don't know.

125
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,393
- Wouldn't you like to know?

126
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:31,916
- On one hand, I do,
 but on the other,

127
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,091
I'm not sure that I'd
 like what I found out.

128
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:38,198
- It's very risky.
 - It would be at that.

129
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,375
Of course, I sleep in
 the groundskeepers lodge,

130
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,688
not the castle.
- Oh.

131
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:49,209
- But I can get into the castle.

132
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,004
- You can?
 - Sure.

133
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:55,422
You know, George, there's
 a trick to poking around.

134
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:59,012
Start when you're about five
 and you make all your mistakes

135
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:01,531
when you're too young to
 earn more than a beating.

136
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:04,017
By the time you get old enough
 to get into real trouble,

137
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,915
you don't make
 any more mistakes.

138
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,815
- So you know the
 inside of the castle.

139
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:14,959
- Inside, outside, all around,
 except for the basement.

140
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,581
That's locked up real tight.

141
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,342
Nobody goes down there except
 for the baron and Ludwig.

142
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:22,656
- Show me.

143
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,524
[tense music]
 [lock clicks]

144
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,806

[lock clicks]
 [door creaks open]

146
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:48,199
- Not bad. Ready
 for the grand tour?

147
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,304
- Do you know where
 the library is?

148
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,168
- I know where everything is.

149
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,481
- Can you take me there?
- Come on.

150
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,208
[dark ethereal music]

151
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,900
[crickets chirp]

152
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,629
- These are all medical books.

153
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:07,459
Anatomy, physiology, chemistry.

154
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,394
They're books of experiments.

155
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:14,466
[footsteps shuffle]

156
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:22,164
Look. Subject,
 white rat, D by D.

157
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,442
Do you have any idea
 what that means?

158
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:31,138
Wait. Length, length of
exposure, 12 seconds.

159
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:35,280
No reaction. Subject, white rat.

160
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,182
Subject, dog, D by D, D by D.

161
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,257
Now it's different. D
by P, cyanide injected.

162
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:49,053
- What's cyanide?
 - It's a poison.

163
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:56,163
- D by P, death by poison,
 and D by D, death by drowning?

164
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,171
- You know a lot, don't you?
 Reading and books and things?

165
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,622
- I don't know as
 much as I'd like.

166
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:09,176
Here, see if you can
 find anything else.

167
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,764
I'm gonna check the last volume.

168
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,837
[footsteps shuffle]

169
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,844
[footsteps shuffle]

170
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,018
See what else there is.

171
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:26,435
- That's no good. Can't read.

172
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:29,679
- You can't read?
 - I never bothered with it.

173
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,130
- I'm sorry.
 - Why?

174
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,270
I'd like to see how
well you do in a garden.

175
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:39,517
- This isn't the current volume.
It only goes up to March.

00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,575

[dog barks]
 [tense music]

184
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:06,993

[footsteps shuffle]

187
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:19,971
You know him? That's Ludwig,
 your uncle's assistant.

188
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,041
- Yeah, I've met him.

189
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,045
- He lords over the rest of
 the staff, that's for sure.

190
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,151
Actually like he
runs the castle.

[dog barks]
 [cart rattles]

192
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:30,395
- What's that on the cart?

193
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:33,778
Looks like a coffin.

194
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:38,472
- Yeah, it does, doesn't
it? Wonder whose.

195
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:46,135
- Limbs are in good condition.
 We'll salvage those.

196
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:50,208
Thorax is useless.
 Viscera is necrotic.

197
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,659
- The head?
 - Useless.

198
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,385
We'll start with the arms.

199
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:55,800
I wanna try to save
the major muscle groups

200
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,628
of the shoulders.

201
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,355
Right, let's get started.

202
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,983

00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,852
late into the night.

206
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,959
- And how far do you
 wanna go with this?

207
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,616
- How far do you wanna go?

208
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,066
- If we're caught doing this,

209
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,447
me and the gaff are gonna
 be put out of the job,

210
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,140
and you could be shipped off
 to an orphanage somewhere

211
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,556
or wherever it is they ship
 girls who stick their noses

212
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,282
in when they're not supposed to.

213
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,181
- Thomas, I wanna know what
 my uncle does down there.

214
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,182
I wanna see.

215
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,737
So you're gonna come?

216
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:41,915
Tonight.

221
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,526
- This is a man, not a dog.

222
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,804
- Thus, all the
 dangerous potential.

[steam hisses]

232
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,514
- Should we increase the power?

233
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,826
- If we set it high,
 we'll reduce it to ashes.

[keys jingle]
 [tense music]

- What is it? Can
 you see anything?

252
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,427
- No, and I don't want to.

253

[keys jingle]

254
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,328
Look, we'll get these keys
 back to Ludwig's room,

255
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:43,846
and you'll get back to yours.

256
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:47,919
- It was a man, a man screaming.

257
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,129
- I don't know what it was,
 and I don't wanna know.

00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,839
- What is it my uncle said
 he needed to see me about?

265
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,152
- More questions?
 - Is he all right?

 [heels clack]

268
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,710
Uncle Victor, are you all right?

269
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,508
- Your uncle is has
had, how shall I put it?

270
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:26,993
Shock to his system.

271
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,238
- Yes, it's really
 nothing. I'll be fine.

272
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:33,758
We were wondering, Anna,
 that is, I was wondering,

273
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:36,175
if you happened to hear
anything last night?

274
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,659
- Screaming, perhaps.

275
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:43,182
- I did hear something, but I
 thought it was just a dream.

276
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,252
- No, I'm afraid not.

277
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:47,945
We just thought that you
might've heard and been alarmed,

278
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,774
so we wanted to explain.

279
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:54,779
- Your uncle and I are doing
some very, very important work.

280
00:19:55,987 --> 00:20:00,682
We are trying to find a
way to cure the insane.

281
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,237
- Cure the insane?
 - Yes.

282
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:09,035
Last night, we had a poor
 lunatic from the asylum

283
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:15,421
in Bellheim down in our
laboratory, a subject.

284
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,288
I'm afraid he became
 rather violent,

285
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:22,704
but everything is fine now.

286
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:25,224
- We just didn't
 want you to worry.

287
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:30,298
- Now your uncle has to sleep.

288
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,509
- Was it successful?
 - I'm sorry?

289
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:39,790
- The cure. Was the man cured?

290
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,414
- Yes! Yes, he's
much better now.

- What did you find?

294
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,739
- I followed its
 trails to the lake.

295
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,811
It must have fallen.

- No madman ever
 looked like that.

313
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,012
That wasn't any kind of man.

314
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:43,085
That's what they're doing down
 there, magic, devil's magic.

315
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:44,811
They conjured up that thing.

316
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:47,020
- Ghost don't leave footprints.

317
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,884
- Who says they don't.

318
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:52,440
- We can follow his tracks.
 Maybe we'll find something.

319
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,751
- No.

320
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:54,994
I'm not gonna stick
 my nose in any more

321
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,961
where it doesn't
 belong; it's crazy.

Thomas, please, listen.

352
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:14,823
I followed the trail.
 It led to the lake.

353
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:18,655
- Listen up, whatever you're
 getting mixed up in, quit it.

354
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:21,002
And if you're not gonna quit
 it, then leave me out of it.

355
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:22,244
I don't care what you say.

356
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:24,074
Some things it's just
better off not knowing.

357
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:27,111
- I don't believe that, and
 I don't think you do either.

358
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,012
- Think what you want.

362
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:49,617
- So how are you
 feeling this morning?

363
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,967
All right. Let's
open your shirt.

364
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:55,795
Shirt.

365
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,248
Sorry these don't
 fit any better.

366
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,663
They were largest
 ones in the rag bin,

367
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:04,908
and I'm not much of a
seamstress, I'm afraid.

[bird caws]

369
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:07,911
I don't understand.

370
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:15,781
You're healing so quickly, and
 these others? It's amazing.

371
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,790
Here's some breakfast.

372
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:29,622

00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,626
I wish you could talk.

375
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:40,150
You know, tell me what happened
to you, where you came from.

376
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:49,331
Do you even remember?
 Can you understand me?

377
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,714
[bird caws]

378
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:53,577
I guess not.

379
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:56,787
You know, I don't
 see why you have

380
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,237
to be different
 from anybody else.

381
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:04,277
I don't mind telling you that
 it's getting a bit lonely.

382
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,039
It'd be nice to have a friend

383
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,009
to talk to every once in
awhile, a real friend.

384
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:15,910
- Friend.

385
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,533
- What?

386
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,293
[slow dramatic music]

387
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:21,122
- Friend.

388
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:24,401
- Yes, friend, Anna.

389
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:29,509
Friend.
 - Friend.

[footsteps shuffle]

392
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,733
- Don't lie around
 sleeping all day.

393
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:48,943
- Hmm?

394
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,394
What are those?

395
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:56,295
- Your uncle wanted you to
have some books. Here they are.

[books thud]

397
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:00,264
- But these are
 children's books.

398
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:03,612
- You are a child, but
if you don't want them.

399
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:06,270
- No, no, I'll take
 them. Thank you.

400
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,376
- Waste of time for
 a proper young lady.

401
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:14,382
If you give a squint,
 well, with your face,

402
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:16,591
it'd hardly make a
 difference, I suppose.

403
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,594
If you want breakfast,
 don't hang about.

Girl.

415
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,284
- Anna.

[Anna laughs]

417
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:59,807

Man.

419
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,745
- Friend.

420
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,471
- [laughs] All right, come on.

00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,025
We'll start from the beginning.

423
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:16,271

Somebody's been in my room!

428
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,334
- Your room. [chuckles]

429
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:46,094
I didn't know that
you'd bought the castle.

430
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:47,716
- Everything is
 all over the place.

431
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:50,996
- Well, then I suppose you
 have to straighten it up.

432
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,549
- Who went in my room?

433
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,000
- Don't take that tone of
 voice with me, young lady.

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,520
You're living in his house
because of your uncle's charity.

435
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,248
You have no rights here, no
 more than any other beggar.

436
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:04,492
Now get back upstairs.

Uncle Victor?

00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,068
I wanna see my uncle.

Fraulein Frankenstein.

The machine, my machine,

450
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:27,782
requires constant care and
attention, like a child almost.

451
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,232
- Uncle, somebody's
 been in my room.

452
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:32,269
- Yes, it was I.

453
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:34,444
- You? What gave you the right?

454
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:37,447
- Your uncle gave me the right.

455
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:41,416
- But why? I don't understand.

456
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,214
- Anna, don't you? Don't you
 understand perfectly well?

457
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,217
Do you know this?

458
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:56,259
Do you recognize this?
 Where did you get it?

459
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,020
- I found it in the woods.
 - You found it in the woods.

460
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:01,920
Why would you say such a thing?

461
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:08,029
- I don't know.
 - Don't you? I think you do.

462
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,652
Talk! What do you know?

463
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:15,588
- I know.
 - What do you know, Anna?

464
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:17,142
- I know what you do down here.

465
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,007
- What is that?

466
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,078
- You bring the
 dead back to life.

467
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:23,320
- How do you...

468
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,804
- No, no, restoring
 life to the dead.

469
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:28,360
That was only the
 beginning. I will tell you.

470
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,810
- Herr Baron!
 - I will tell you everything.

471
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:35,436
This machine, in this
 crucible I create life itself.

472
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:39,060
Within this pit poses
 the pure essence of life,

473
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,236
the fundamental energy
 for which all life spring.

474
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,376
I pour it into the
dead, and the dead live.

475
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:47,241
We've gone beyond that.

476
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,174
In this room, we
assembled a man,

477
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,555
put it together from
 pieces of the dead,

478
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:54,179
assembled him like
 a puzzle of flesh.

479
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,836
We loaded him into the pit
 and poured life into him.

480
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:59,978
We created a man who
had never lived before,

481
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,187
brought a new thing
 into the world.

482
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,603
- Where is it?
 Where is it hiding?

483
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:06,846
- I don't know what
 you're talking about.

484
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:08,434
- It's been a dream of the ages.

485
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,886
Of all things that were
born on this earth,

486
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,130
we human beings alone
 know that we must die,

487
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,892
that all we know
 and love must die.

488
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:22,414
It's been a curse that's
followed men from the beginning.

489
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:25,382
But here in this
 place, I banish death.

490
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:28,834
You of all people
 must understand.

491
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:31,630
What of my brother,
 of your mother?

492
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,978
What if we had the power
to bring them back?

493
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,119
- Do you?

494
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:42,779
- Not yet, but one day, perhaps.

495
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,126
- What about friend?
 That man you-

496
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:47,163
- The one you know
 nothing about?

497
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,442
- You said you assembled
them from pieces,

498
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:53,893
but what about his
 brain, his mind?

499
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:58,174
Who was he? Why can't
he remember who he was?

500
00:33:58,174 --> 00:33:59,037
- Who can say?

501
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:04,904
Whatever memories he had,
 whoever he was was destroyed,

502
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,357
erased, either by the
effects of death itself

503
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:12,429
or by the process
 of revivification.

504
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,227
Now he's only a shell, a
 thing newborn in a man's body.

505
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,678
We didn't anticipate it.

506
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:24,269
No, he came out of that
pit a screaming thing.

507
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,892
- Like a newborn child.
- It's a monster!

508
00:34:26,892 --> 00:34:30,482
We hoped that it had died, but
 it's still alive, isn't it?

509
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,000
You bring it food. I've seen it.

510
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,037
You know where it is.

511
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:35,107
- You must tell us.

512
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,972
[dramatic music]

513
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:40,250
It won't hurt me.

514
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,529
- Is it dying from its wounds?

515
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,635
- No, they've healed.
 - Healed?

516
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,948
Ludwig, just as I thought.

517
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:52,400
Hit by a shotgun blast
should've been instantly fatal.

518
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,368
The life force in
 him is far stronger

519
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,232
than in any other
 normal human being.

520
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:59,097
- Then it cannot be
killed by normal means.

521
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,236
Baron, we must act.

522
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,549
- As I seem to recall,
 you were the one

523
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:04,999
who said we do nothing.

524
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,795
- I saw no reason to
 search for a cause

525
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:10,901
where things seem to become,
 well, this different.

526
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:15,113
I've been to the
village. He's been seen.

527
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,908
Do you know he killed a man
 the day after he escaped?

528
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,635
- What? Why didn't you tell me?

529
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,879
- I thought it better not to.

530
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,605
- I don't believe it.

531
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,434
- Oh, you can believe
 it, young girl.

532
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:32,130
He was seen. There aren't
 two like him in the world.

533
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,097
- Anna, you have to
 tell us where he is.

534
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:36,272
We have to recapture him.
 - What for?

535
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:38,653
- Because he killed
 man. He's dangerous.

536
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:41,932
- I mean, recapture
 him for what purpose?

537
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:45,591
- To study him, to find
where we went wrong.

538
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,697
- I don't believe you.
 - Enough!

541
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:55,981
You are to remain here
 until you tell us.

542
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,327
In the meantime,
 we'll search for him.

543
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:59,018
- He can't be far away.

544
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:01,607
- Wait, please.
 He won't hurt me.

545
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,473
Please! Don't hurt him.

548
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,176
Who's there?
 - Well,

549
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,833
you've certainly got the
 castle in an uproar, George.

550
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,215
- Thomas, my uncle.

551
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,907
- He was in the woods
 all day with Ludwig.

552
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:27,530
They came dragging back
around an hour ago,

553
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,084
not looking very
 happy, I can tell you.

554
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,292
What's going on?

555
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:33,398
- Thomas, you have to
 get me out of here.

556
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:34,640
- There's no key in the lock,

557
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,229
and Frau Herstner's
 still in the kitchen.

558
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,818
- Thomas, please listen
to me. I need your help.

559
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,755
They're looking for that
 man we saw the other night.

560
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,722
- Man?

561
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:49,345
- I don't have time to explain.

562
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,935
Please believe me, whatever
 he looks like, he is a man.

563
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,076
My uncle and Ludwig are
 looking for him right now,

564
00:36:57,076 --> 00:36:58,975
and if they catch him,
they're gonna kill him.

00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:25,588
Where are you?

571
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,766
I have a message from Anna.

572
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:35,908
Do you understand? Anna.

573
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:41,293
She sent me here. She
 told me to tell you-

574
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,848
- No! Get away from him, boy!

575
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,574
He's a madman. Get back.

[flames whoosh]

579
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:55,928
Pain?

580
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:58,483
- What are you doing?
- Get out of here, boy.

581
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:00,968
Back. Back to the castle!

[body thuds]

587
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:18,399
- Let's get this thing
 back to the castle

588
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:19,400
and finish with him!

00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,336
[slow dramatic music]
 [crickets chirp]

590
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,684
- Anna.
 - Thomas, did you find him?

591
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:30,169
- Sorry. They
 must've followed me.

592
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:35,243
They caught him. They've taken
 him down into the basement.

593
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:38,039
- Thomas, you have to get me
 out of here. You've got to.

594
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,801
- I'll find the key.

- Amazing.

600
00:38:57,507 --> 00:39:00,027
Any of these wounds should've
 been instantly fatal.

601
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:01,994
The injection itself
 could've killed

602
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:03,306
at least three normal men.

603
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,552
- There's only one sure
way here, Herr Baron.

604
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,245
Raise the pit temperature
 to 400 and drop it in.

605
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:15,905
It'll be incinerated.
 No trace will remain.

606
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,496
Herr Baron, we must hurry.

607
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,948
- Yes.

608
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:29,988
Yes, you're right.

- Thomas, the sound from the
 basement. It's getting louder.

613
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,660
- [Thomas] I'm
 trying, I'm trying.

[machinery clicks and whirs]

615
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:58,292
- Herr Baron, quickly,
 the last lever.

616
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,155
- Friend.

617
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:02,710
[slow dramatic music]

618
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,539
- What?

619
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:06,990
What?
 - Friend.

620
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:12,133
- He speaks.
 - Herr Baron.

621
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,137
- I can't do this.
 - What?

622
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:19,037
- He spoke.
 - So it is a parrot.

623
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:23,110
It means nothing. It
 must be destroyed!

624
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,666
- I thought it was just a
 mindless thing, but he's not.

625
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:28,874
He speaks. He's a man.

626
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:31,014
- Man.

627
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:35,467
- Are you insane?
 He's committed murder.

628
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,505
We'd be held responsible.

629
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:42,267
You're willing to risk
 the gallows for thing?

630
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:44,545
- I'll take that chance.

631
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:49,999
- I won't. I won't be
 responsible for such a thing.

632
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,001
- We are responsible.

633
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,073
His crime is ours, and I will
 not commit another murder.

634
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:55,936
- You will not?

635
00:40:57,178 --> 00:41:00,596
Then stand aside and let
me do what must be done.

636
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,736
That is what you do best.

- No, we'll get you out!

- The machine. It will
 destroy itself and the castle.

650
