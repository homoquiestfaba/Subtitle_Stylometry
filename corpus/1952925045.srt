1
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,207
My dear, devoted Deva.

2
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,832
Your skills have become extraordinary

3
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,207
I've been blessed by your teachings, master

4
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,374
Come, sit with this old man for a moment

5
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:01,166
You have passed every physical challenge

6
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,916
endured the hardship of our ways

7
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:08,207
But for you to be fully realised as
a Bharmaja a protector,

8
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,999
I must know if your mind

9
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,916
and heart and spirit are also forged anew

10
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,207
Please recite for me the 3rd lesson of the Bharmaja

11
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,457
To stop rather than injure

12
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,082
injure rather than maim

13
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:32,249
maim rather than kill

14
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:40,582
and only take a life when the needs of the spirit

15
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,416
outweigh the needs of the body...

16
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,124
You have walked far into the sunlight, Deva...

17
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,082
but I sense a shadow on you yet

18
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,791
I would know of the road...

19
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,916
that brought you to our temple gate...

20
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,082
It was four years ago. . .

21
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,291
my first task as a Bharmaja:

22
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,124
to protect my teacher

23
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,249
The Bagwun?

24
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,082
Yes

25
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,832
Purma was a nation torn apart by civil war

26
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:18,082
The rebel forces, the PLM,
controlled the North of the country

27
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,249
the government forces the South

28
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,499
Rebel leader Kin Lompoc's men detained and executed

29
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,624
anyone believed to support the existing regime

30
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:33,749
Executions were carried out daily,
brutally and without trial

31
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,957
The only hope lay with the Bagwun

32
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:57,166
a spiritual leader revered by the people of Purma

33
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:02,166
a man bringing a message of peace to a land at war

34
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,749
A man I was sworn to protect. . .

35
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:10,707


36
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,457
The Purmese government had provided us

37
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,957
with rooms at a 5-star hotel

38
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,666
and a full security detail around the clock

39
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,207
Even so,

40
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,791
I sensed danger that night...

41
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,666
What is it?

42
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,499
I don't know

43
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,207
Something wrong?

44
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,207
I'm not sure

45
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,666
Deva, why must you always...

46
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,041
look for shadows on a sun-filled day?

47
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,541
The brighter the sun, the darker the shadow

48
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,207
That sounds very wise...

49
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,166
It should, you said it

50
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,082
Ah. . .

51
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,249
very wise indeed

52
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,874
Is there anything else before bed?

53
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:33,707
No, I feel very content and safe

54
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,082
Alright! Well, I'll leave you then

55
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,041
The Bagwun is alone

56
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,874
Copy! Stand by

57
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,874
We have a very serious problem here

58
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,416
What kind of problem?

59
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,999
The Bagwun, he needs a blood transfusion

60
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:32,666
So do it

61
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,416


62
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,916
It's his blood type. It's AB Rh negative

63
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,749
It's a very rare blood type

64
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,541
How rare?

65
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,749
Here is the donor list with addresses

66
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,207
and contact numbers, doctor

67
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,291
Thank you

68
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,957
We've called all the other hospitals in the area

69
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:53,374
and could only find five donors on record

70
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,541
Four in the metro area

71
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,749
and one man we were treating for a liver disorder

72
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,707
He lives up north

73
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,582
His name is Tremayne

74
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,291
We still have the address of the clinic

75
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,957
where we used to send him his medicine

76
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:10,916
So,

77
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,082
we go with one of the four donors here in town

78
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,082
What if you can't find them

79
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:18,957
Shouldn't you...

80
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,791
look for this Tremayne as well?

81
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,832
I'm not sending one of my men up north

82
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,416
It's a suicide mission

83
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,749
I'll go

84
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,124
The PLM own that part of the country

85
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,082
They don't take kindly to outsiders

86
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:34,666
Unlike your men,

87
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,249
it's possible I can slip in and out of area quietly

88
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,291
I can take care of myself

89
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,957
Yeah, I've noticed

90
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,166
If you want to go, I won't stop you

91
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,166
But you're on your own

92
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,291
Thank you

93
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,041
Here's the information

94
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,374
Long live the liberation

95
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:43,041


96
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,707
What are you doing here?

97
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:46,749
Bad news

98
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,082
Did you contact our operators in the city?

99
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,582
They are in process.

100
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:00,749
Good.

101
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,166
Did you see who's name is on this list?

102
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,666
Small world.

103
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,041
Go back to the city.

104
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,707
Kill the other four donors.

105
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,416
And what about Tremayne?

106
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,374
I'll send Logan to keep an eye on him.

107
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:16,707
Go!

108
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,916
I really appreciate this.

109
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,749
But, is there any way
you can make it a round trip?

110
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,374
I'd like to help you.

111
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,957
But I've got medical supplies to deliver.

112
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,999
Where you're going is a real hot zone.

113
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,249
I can drop you, but that's it.

114
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,832
Good enough. Let's go.

115
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,249
So how long have you been flying this route.

116
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,499
Two years too long.

117
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,582
This territory has changed hands more times
than I've had my blades oiled.

118
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,291
We have to use civilian choppers
like this one even to deliver medicine.

119
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,124
Cause you never know
who's gonna be taking a shot at you.

120
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,082
It's a gorgeous country.

121
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,541
Yeah, it would be

122
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,957
if it wasn't at war with itself.

123
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,791
The village you're looking for...

124
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,499
is 2 miles north from here.

125
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,332
Alright, thanks. .

126
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:20,999
Good luck.

127
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,374
You too.

128
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,499


129
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,207
Mr. Tran

130
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,166
Hey! What's taking so long?

131
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,166
Coming!

132
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,124
Hey, go see what's taking so long!

133
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,082
So, which way is Apkwat Village?

134
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,749
Two miles this way.

135
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,166
Excuse me...

136
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,291
I didn't call for a girl.

137
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,166
What?

138
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,499
Did Madame Kai send you?

139
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,832
Who?

140
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,332
Madame Kai. Don't you work for...?

141
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,707
No. I don't know a Madame Kai.

142
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:53,374
No, you don't work for Madame Kai, do you?

143
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,832
Who are you? What do you want?

144
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,624
I need your help.

145
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,124
To do what?

146
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,207
Do you know your blood type?

147
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,749
Well, let's just say the day
I need a blood transfusion

148
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,332
is the day I'm gonna die.

149
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,707
So, you're John Tremayne?

150
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,541
You want to tell me what's this all about?

151
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,041
There's been an attempt on the life of the Bagwun.

152
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,999
Yeah, I heard about that. He's the peace activist.

153
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:28,082
He needs a blood transfusion. AB Rh negative.

154
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,082
You got the wrong guy.

155
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,874
I don't want anything to do with this.

156
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,749
I don't care about the Bagwun.

157
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,249
Doesn't seem like you care about anything

158
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,541
from the looks of this place.

159
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,957
You know. . .you're smarter than you look.

160
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,124
Get out.

161
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,207
You're still here, aren't you?

162
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,791
All right, let me get my pants on

163
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,749
and we'll see if we can figure this thing out. Ok?

164
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,291
Ok!

165
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,291
Give me the usual.

166
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,124
You here early. Why?

167
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,291
Murphy's law.

168
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,207
What that mean?

169
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,874
Never mind.

170
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,207
Business is booming. Who are they?

171
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,874
They've been here all night

172
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:51,666
They celebrate some big PLM victory.

173
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,999
Son of the bitch.

174
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,249
Hey! Bartender.

175
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,082
Get us some drinks, you lazy bastard!

176
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,666
Oh, Ok

177
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,999
You? American?

178
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,374
You look like a spy.

179
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,207
Maybe C. I.A.?

180
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,624
Guess again.

181
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,124
What's that?

182
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:39,707
I said, guess again.

183
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,082
It's okay.

184
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,416
We like American.

185
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,082
America support the PLM, yes?

186
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:50,291
I don't know. And I don't care.

187
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:54,249
What about you? Do you support the PLM?

188
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,207
I used to...

189
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:58,207
What?

190
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,291
. . .before they started with the suicide bombs

191
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:03,082
and killing innocent women and children.

192
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,957
Say that again.

193
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,541
I don't want any trouble!

194
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,666
Are you alright?

195
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:36,207


196
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,249
Mr. Trinh's office is just up here.

197
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,166
Hey, he's downstairs.

198
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,416
Really?

199
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,082
I didn't need you help.

200
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,082
Yeah,

201
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,207
you look like you had everything under control.

202
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,041
What don't you get?

203
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,041
Why can't you understand.

204
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,207
I'm not your man.

205
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,124
I'm not the volunteering type.

206
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,874
You might not appreciate
the teachings of the Bagwun.

207
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,874
and you might not fully understand
the implications all of this....

208
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,582
...Just save it!

209
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,624
Look, I. . .

210
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,082
I used to be like you.

211
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,207
But not anymore.

212
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,582
And the only thing that

213
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,582
I'm called on to do in this life

214
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,916
is to look after myself.

215
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,124
This is bigger than one man's life.

216
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,791
This is more important than you or me.

217
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:12,291
I'm not putting my ass on the line
for him or anyone else.

218
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,499
Not anymore.

219
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,957
Why are you following me?

220
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,166
Because I have my duty, as you have yours.

221
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,082
You know you are wasting your time
with that shit on me

222
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,749
Hey John, it's been a long time.

223
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,457
How're you doing?

224
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,041
Doing alright Niko. How you been?

225
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,166
What have you been up to?

226
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,666
Fighting the good fight. Who's your friend?

227
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,999
She is just a hooker. What's going on?

228
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,166
Lompoc. He wants to talk to you.

229
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,707
Really...

230
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,541
Ok, eh. . .

231
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,207
When?

232
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,374
Now.

233
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,166
Well, I got some other things I'm doing today.

234
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,832
Tell him I'll catch up with him later in the week.

235
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,624
Well, to be perfectly honest with you, John

236
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,207
it's not really a request...

237
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,374
Drop the AK, Niko!

238
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:15,541
Drop it!

239
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,457
What are you doing?

240
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,041
Put the gun down!

241
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,041
Hey, John!

242
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:20,874
Put it down!

243
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:21,624
Calm down, John!

244
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:22,666
Ok, here! here

245
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,832
I put it down. . .Ok! Ok!

246
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,374
Put your hands up! Hands up!

247
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,582
Get them up!

248
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,207
I had seen guns before,

249
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,499
but never a man shot in cold blood.

250
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:46,499
Go! Get out of here! Go! Go!

251
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:01,041
And I wondered to myself,
who was this John Tremayne?

252
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,791
Come on!

253
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,082
Get in!

254
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,832
They're heading south. . .

255
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:55,791


256
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,166
What's going on?

257
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,999
Where did you learn to fight like that?

258
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:21,332
I was trained from childhood to be a Bharmaja.

259
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:23,916
A what?

260
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,082
A protector for the Bagwun.

261
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,832
It's my family's duty.

262
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,666
My father was the last Protector.

263
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,999
And now I must carry on the tradition.

264
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,166
So it's a ceremonial position?

265
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,791
As a Bharmaja, my duties will only end

266
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:41,582
when all men are liberated by
forgiveness and compassion.

267
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,749
Good luck with that.

268
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,707
I'm sure it is hard for you to comprehend.

269
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:53,749
A female bodyguard without a weapon?

270
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,249
No, I...get it.

271
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,791
All that matters is the Bagwun is in danger

272
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,416
and now we must save him.

273
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:11,916
What is it?

274
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,957
We're being followed.

275
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,916
Floor it!

276
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:22,249
Pull over!

277
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,249
Ah! The AK!

278
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:31,582
What?

279
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,416
Turn right!

280
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:37,749
Ok!

281
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:32,541
Whoa! That was intense, man!

282
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,082
Good driving.

283
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,749
Thanks.

284
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,249
For a girl.

285
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:22,332
He escaped.

286
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,457
He's got help. A woman.

287
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,749
We've had a report she's connected to Bagwun.

288
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,832
I should have sent you.

289
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,999
Where is he now?

290
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:37,332
I assume they are traveling East
along the Kher River.

291
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:42,832
Assume? Assume!

292
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,749
It's just one man!

293
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,124
If we can't take a man,

294
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,957
how can we take a nation?

295
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,124
Everyday! Everyday!

296
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,749
We got worse news!

297
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,791
More soldiers lost,

298
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,249
less new recruits.

299
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,166
If the old man lives,

300
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,207
it's all over!

301
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:05,666
The revolution, the cause is finished!

302
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,957
If Tremayne makes it to the city,

303
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,957
we won't get another chance.

304
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,166
Don't worry, he won't

305
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,166
He can't!

306
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,291
What do you want to do?

307
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,457
Let's go hunting.

308
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,374
What are we gonna do now?

309
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,666
Come on.

310
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:09,499
But the city is that way. The Bagwun is that way.

311
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,916
We can't stay in the open road
with the PLM after us.

312
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,166
That's suicide.

313
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,082
Come on! I got a plan.

314
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,416
What about the gun?

315
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,916
They're no good without bullets.

316
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,916
Or didn't they teach you that in Bharmaja school?

317
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,416
Why are you so angry?

318
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,791
I'm not angry, you haven't seen me angry.

319
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,791
I'm irritated.

320
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,416
Why are you so irritated?

321
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,249
Cause I'm in the middle of nowhere.

322
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,082
I got no money.

323
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,916
Everything I own is in that hut back there.

324
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,249
Which I'll never be able to go back to.

325
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,249
We can pay.

326
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,374
What?

327
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,582
The Bagwun's followers are very rich.

328
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,582
They can pay you whatever you ask.

329
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,457
Why didn't you say that before?

330
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:11,124
It never occurred to me

331
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:13,791
that you would want to be paid
to do the right thing.

332
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:18,166
Well it should have. Come on!

333
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,124
This might turn out better than I thought.

334
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:33,416


335
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,624
Sorry Captain,

336
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,291
they got him.

337
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:22,749
How is he doing?

338
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:25,791
Shouldn't I be asking you?

339
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:29,082
His blood pressure is extremely low.

340
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,749
How long does he have?

341
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,457
It's hard to say.

342
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,082
A day at most.

343
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,874
He doesn't look too worried, does he?

344
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,916
Maybe he knows something we don't...

345
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:57,291
So you want me to go in there? Alone?

346
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,916
They'll be looking for me. You, not the case.

347
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:05,249
And Jesse can get us the weapons we might need.

348
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,457
So. . .

349
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,624
You know for a Deva

350
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,457
you can be a bit of diva.

351
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,291
Is that so?

352
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,874
Are you Chang?

353
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,541
Is Jesse around? Uncle Sam sent me.

354
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:49,166
The last I saw Uncle Sam,

355
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,249
he had a broken arm and two black eyes.

356
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,999
It's good to know he's still breathing.

357
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,041
We need weapons.

358
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:09,124
This is very bad timing.

359
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:11,582
We already told the PLM we are dry.

360
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,082
This is not the kind of heat we need right now.

361
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:18,457
Tell Uncle Sam not now, not here.

362
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,916
Can I speak to Jesse about it?

363
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,041
Jesse is up there.

364
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,124
But she's not going to like

365
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:27,416
one of Uncle Sam's girls

366
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,207
coming in and asking for weapons.

367
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,457
I am not one of Uncle Sam's girls.

368
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:34,416
How much?

369
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,916
Not for sale.

370
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,332
Everyone's for sale.

371
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,999
Leave him alone!

372
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,416
If anybody is going to kill him it's gonna be me.

373
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,207
Let me get this straight

374
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,207
so I'm supposed to get you guns

375
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:48,124
transport and safe passage out of here?

376
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,207
That's right.

377
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:54,457
And I'm doing this why, exactly?

378
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,124
She's with the Bagwun...

379
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,916
And I'm kind of helping her out.

380
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,749
It's always the same old story with you, John.

381
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:04,541
I'm just not buying into it any more.

382
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,624
What he's doing is a holy thing.

383
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,082
He's risking his life for the greater good.

384
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,249
Is this true?

385
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,457
Yes.

386
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,707
If it will help save the Bagwun, I'll do it.

387
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,541
We leave in 40 minutes.

388
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:26,082
Jane will show you where you can freshen up

389
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,666
Thank you.

390
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,082
So. . .This is it. . .

391
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,791
This is our changing room.

392
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,291
It's all yours now.

393
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,416
The towels are in the corner.

394
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,916
Just help yourself.

395
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,916
And let me know if I can get you anything else.

396
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,124
Ok.

397
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:53,666
We. . .heard about the Bagwun. Is it serious?

398
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,957
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

399
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:59,749
We will pray for him.

400
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:00,957
Thanks.

401
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:05,999
And. . .when he's better,
please ask him to pray for us.

402
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,957
Ok...

403
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,499
I will. . .

404
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,124
Thanks.

405
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:22,666
Even though we'd survived the journey so far,

406
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,499
I feared that worse might lie ahead.

407
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,541
I remembered the Bagwun's words:

408
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,999
A balanced ship survives the storm.

409
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:37,832
A balanced ship...

410
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,249
I think we're ok.

411
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,374
I'll take you as far I as can.

412
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:14,249
After that, you'll have another two miles on foot.

413
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,457
That'd be great.

414
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,332
Hey Chang, what's up?

415
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,832
Oh! Nothing much.

416
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:42,291
Where's Jesse?

417
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,249
She's down south.

418
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:48,624
New shipment of women coming in. Back tomorrow.

419
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:55,124
You lie to me. I don't like it when people lie.

420
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,291
One more time, then you bleed.

421
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,499
Where is Jesse?

422
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:10,707
Fuck you! Fuck the PLM!

423
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,332
Who's next?

424
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,957
I should warn you, this guy we're going to see

425
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,166
is a bit of a degenerate.

426
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:36,499
Actually, he's a total degenerate.

427
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,999
A friend of yours? Hard to believe.

428
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:42,916
Take one more step. . .

429
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:44,916
and I will blow your head off.

430
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,166
Ding, it's me. . .

431
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,249
Me who?

432
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:49,707
John Tremayne.

433
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,374
J.T.?

434
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,374
You look like shit...

435
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,541
Ding - do you mind?

436
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:58,707
Oh yeah...sorry.

437
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,249
But seriously bro.

438
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,499
You look like an old man.

439
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,207
But it is good to see you anyway.

440
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,582
And I see you still got good taste!

441
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,207
How much?

442
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,916
He didn't pay for me.

443
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,374
And you're still getting it for free!

444
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,957
I'm not with him.

445
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,957
Even better. I buy.

446
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,291
You know it may come as a shock to you,

447
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,416
but there are some women in this country

448
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,916
not for sale.

449
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,791
Feisty, feisty.

450
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,082
I like her. Come on, J.T.

451
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,374
Let's have a drink for old times sake.

452
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:44,749
Hey baby, we talk price later.

453
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:53,416
All of this, this and this...

454
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,041
This is a rebel's territory now.

455
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:58,582
These waterways are the only access to the river. . .

456
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,999
before Havahava bridge.

457
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,457
No way we can make it through there.

458
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:09,124
What if we went up river here,

459
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,624
and then cut across on foot?

460
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,457
Yeah. Not so many rebels there.

461
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,249
I was up river yesterday,

462
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:19,999
passed right along this road.

463
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:22,082
The checkpoint was deserted.

464
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:23,624
Perfect.

465
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,457
You want 2 AK's

466
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,791
and a 45 and enough rounds to fight an army

467
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,791
and you want Ding to take you up river?

468
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,124
Yeah.

469
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,791
That's right.

470
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,624
You're my only hope.

471
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:42,291
And now that I said that,

472
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,041
it makes me realize how desperate I really am.

473
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:49,207
But...you have no money.

474
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,041
No...

475
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,332
I guess.

476
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:01,041
We will just have to work this out some other way.

477
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,707
Ding, you owe me.

478
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:10,791
Ding owes you?

479
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:13,124
Yeah! You remember that time the 5 hookers

480
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,666
had your pants down
and were about to cut off your. . .

481
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:18,166
Okay, okay, okay!

482
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:20,666
You're right.

483
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:21,499
You know I'm right.

484
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:22,457
I help.

485
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,999
Thank you!

486
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:27,207
Hey baby! You like Hollywood?

487
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:30,041
Ding have camera!

488
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:47,207
I don't understand.
I aimed just like you showed me.

489
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:51,374
It's not your aim. It's your fear.

490
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:53,249
What fear?

491
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,166
Fear of the weapon.

492
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,207
When you pull the trigger, you flinch.

493
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,707
That throws off your aim.

494
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,999
You can't be afraid of the weapon.

495
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,082
Weapon can't hurt you.

496
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,749
Try it again.

497
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,582
You're a natural.

498
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,124
The Bagwun says there is no fear.

499
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,291
Only illusion of ego.

500
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,124
A pretty girl like you

501
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,582
Would be more interesting

502
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,749
if she wasn't always quoting the Bagwun.

503
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,207
You think I'm pretty?

504
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,457
Time to go!

505
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:25,999
Do you really believe that

506
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,832
we're on a mission from god?

507
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:30,499
No!

508
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,332
I think it's sad that you felt like you had to lie

509
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:37,291
for someone to believe that you're better

510
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:39,207
than you actually are.

511
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,999
If I hadn't of said that,

512
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:44,457
Jesse would've just thrown us out on our asses

513
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,874
Do you believe in anything?

514
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:50,707
I used to.

515
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:56,499
When I was a kid I believed in god.

516
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,499
Went to church and everything.

517
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:03,457
But. . .

518
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:07,499
then I...joined the military.

519
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,874
And I saw what war did to men.

520
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:17,582
The hatred.

521
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:20,541
There was no god there.

522
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,916
And if there was a god there...

523
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,749
it was a god of fear,

524
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,041
the pain and suffering.

525
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:44,041
Not the kind of god you believe in.

526
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,999
The god I believe in lives in the present,

527
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,041
not the past.

528
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,916
He judges us for who we are,

529
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,249
not who we were.

530
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,291
And he believes that there is hope for all men.

531
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:00,082
Even me?

532
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:02,416
Especially you.

533
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,582
I used to look like Bruce Lee, honey.

534
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:18,582
Running guns in Hong Kong. Big clients.

535
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,291
Uncle Sam, Afghans.

536
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,207
Big, big money.

537
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,457
Every month, different girls.

538
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,457
I can go for days, honey.

539
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:55,124
I got him! I saw him go down.

540
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,124
I see the girl. She's down there too.

541
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:15,291
We're in trouble. We're gonna have to split up.

542
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:17,291
I don't wanna split up.

543
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,457
It's our only chance.

544
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,832
They're 3, maybe 4 of them.

545
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,999
They'll cut us to pieces in a straight up fight.

546
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:25,541
We have to out smart them.

547
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:26,957
You're going to be the decoy...

548
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,541
I don't want to be the decoy.

549
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,791
Believe me, you got the easy part.

550
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:37,999
I need you to crawl 1 0 yards that way.

551
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:40,374
Pop up, give them a burst and then hit the ground.

552
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:41,999
And crawl another 1 0 yards, pop up,

553
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,666
give them another burst and then hit the ground.

554
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,666
Arcing, arcing to your left all the time.

555
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,499
Arcing to your left. Pop up, give them a burst.

556
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,499
Hit the ground. You got that?

557
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,041
I'm scared.

558
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,999
You told me you had faith.

559
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,041
Go out there and prove it.

560
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:02,249
Go on! Go. You'll be alright.

561
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,041
Mun, you okay?

562
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:20,207
I'm okay, don't worry about me.

563
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,957
Hold your position!

564
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,082
Let's go get that bitch!

565
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:33,791
No! No!

566
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:54,082
Mun. . .You ok?

567
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:07,332
Mun? Mun!

568
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,749
It's over.

569
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,291
70 men against an army.

570
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,082
That's why I asked for you five.

571
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:55,124
I know what is in your hearts.

572
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:58,374
I will not run,

573
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,082
will not hide,

574
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,207
will not take the coward's way out. . .

575
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:08,832
We lived like brothers,

576
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,457
and now die as brothers.

577
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:21,791
Your father would be so proud of you.

578
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:23,791
Thank you.

579
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,916
Our act will light a torch.

580
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,999
that will set the world on fire.

581
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,499
Long live the liberation!

582
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:48,957
Long live the liberation. . .

583
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:14,166
I keep on thinking about the man that I killed.

584
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,791
I keep on seeing his face.

585
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,707
He was just a kid.

586
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:28,041
That's who always does the fighting and the dying.

587
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:34,207
Yeah, but you've done this before.

588
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,082
It doesn't make it any easier.

589
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:06,207
After the transfusion, I'd like to debrief you.

590
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,041
You know, your government. . .

591
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,749
reminds me too much of my government.

592
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:11,749
And that makes me not want to talk to you.

593
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:16,082
I understand. There is always a conflict

594
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,041
between honor and duty.

595
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,874
You of all people should know that.

596
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,249
You know something Captain. . .

597
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,582
I'm beginning to believe there's a different way.

598
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,082
Ah, that's why you're here.

599
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,624
Are you ready? Come with me.

600
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:05,957
Everybody, take cover.

601
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:18,999
Too quiet.

602
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,624
Anybody feel lucky?

603
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,749
I will go.

604
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,332
ICU! I'm in the hospital!

605
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,916
Give me everything you got!

606
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:17,999
We need help! Now!

607
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,249
Stay here! Cover our ass!

608
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:38,082
Got it!

609
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:39,749
Final push!

610
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,999
3, 2, 1 ...

611
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:59,624
Fuck!

612
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:20,291
You could have made things so much
easier for yourself, John.

613
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:25,666
We are receiving reports from Purma

614
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:28,166
that the rebel PLM forces are in disarray.

615
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,207
This follows official announcements

616
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:32,499
of the death of the rebel leader Kin Lompoc

617
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:36,166
and the arrest of his second in command,
Mara Guang Di.

618
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,166
Apparently,

619
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,332
a suitable blood donor has been found...

620
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,749
and doctors will operate
on the wounded Bagwun shortly.

621
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:47,916
John?

622
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:54,832
Deva

623
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,207
You alright?

624
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:07,582
Yeah, I'm alright. How are you?

625
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:10,916
I've had better days.

626
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,832
John, what you've done for us...

627
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:22,124
Did I really ever have a choice?

628
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,374
Yeah, you always have a choice.

629
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:35,374
The doctor, said that. . .

630
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:38,124
because you've lost so much blood already...

631
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:40,207
that there might be a risk.

632
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:44,582
I know. They told me.

633
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:49,291
And you're going ahead with it?

634
01:19:49,542 --> 01:19:50,916
Yes.

635
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:57,249
Didn't you say that there was hope for everyone...

636
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:01,582
even for someone like me?

637
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,291
Yeah, yeah. . .

638
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:10,666
But not like this,

639
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,332
not like this...

640
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:21,291
I'm sorry, we need to start now.

641
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,082
Have a drink for me.

642
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,041
So you see, it was from John Tremayne.

643
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:51,166
that I learned the duty of being a Protector. . .

644
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:55,041
In the end, it's all about sacrifice.

645
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:58,666
It was the hardest lesson of my life.

646
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:01,624
I wish I had known this John Tremayne.

647
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,541
You were lucky to have such a teacher.

648
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:11,874
Yeah, such a friend.

649
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:14,666
There's a part of me. . .

650
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,332
that lives every day for him.

651
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:35,666
Go in peace, Deva, and take something of our ways

652
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,832
to the world beyond these walls.

653
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:42,207
I shall, I promise you,

654
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,749
wherever the road takes me.
