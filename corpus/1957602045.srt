Well, I'm goddamn good and tired
of holding my breath.

175
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,881
This is my job.

176
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:14,581
This is what I've
been trained to do.

177
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,759
Baby,

178
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:21,849
we've had to make
hard decisions like this

179
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,807
all the time in law school.

180
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,853
This is just another one
of those tests.

181
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,509
And putting my client in jail
is not gonna help
those boys heal.

182
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:33,861
This is the hand we were dealt.

183
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:35,689
And, little girl,
I swear to you,

184
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,430
before my family,

185
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,084
I'm gonna win with it.

186
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:44,175
Tommy-Two, you can go
over to Robbie's house
if you want to,

187
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,177
but if Mrs. Sanchez
starts asking you

188
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,310
any more questions
about your father's trial,

189
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,094
you tell her you don't know.

190
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,402
Yes, Mom.A lot of nerve asking
a child about this thing.

191
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,187
Come on, Stormy.

192
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,321
Mommy, why do the boys
at school

193
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:00,757
call Steve O'Dell
Little One Ball?

194
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,760
Is it 'cause he only has
one testicle?

195
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,807
Sometimes I understand

196
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,070
why animals eat their young.

197
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,507
Ow, ow, ow!
It stings, Mommy!

198
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,769
What stings, Stormy?

199
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,554
There's nothing but water
in your hair.

200
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,337
You're just acting.

201
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,946
[Woman]
Mabel?
Yeah.

202
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,948
He's on TV again.

203
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,907
Who is on TV again, Tina?

204
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,562
Tom.[TV clicks on]

205
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,433
[Man] 
Yesterday's peaceful 
demonstration

206
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,566
turned ugly 
as darkness fell

207
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,480
and looters began making off 
with thousands of dollars

208
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,961
worth of merchandise 
before setting 
a Caldor's on fire.

209
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,225
Attorney for 
the accused arsonist 
in this case

210
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,836
had this to say.

211
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,794
[Tom] 
Hooligans are using the tragedyIt's Daddy.

212
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:41,058
of these misguided young men 
to take what's not theirs.

213
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,366
Now, their actions 
are just as childish 
as my children,

214
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,674
and like children, 
need an appropriate punishment.

215
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:50,633
Is it true you've even 
received death threats 
over this case?

216
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:51,982
Mabel, why didn't you tell me? Some crank calls

217
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,985
from a few desperate 
and confused scoundrels.

218
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,074
That may be the case, 
but we have learned

219
00:09:57,118 --> 00:10:00,121
that two New Haven police 
officers have been assigned 
to guard your law office.

220
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,602
I'm wondering about 
your family. How are they 
holding up through this ordeal?

221
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,474
[Tom] 
All the members of my family 
are strong troopers.

222
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,737
We come from strong stock,

223
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:11,915
and we won't let 
any trashy rascals

224
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,266
cow us 
into bowing our heads.

225
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,790
That is Attorney Tom Spader.

226
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,140
He is the attorney 
for the accused doctor

227
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,968
accused of arson 
and now manslaughter

228
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,188
in this highly divisive 
and contentious case.

229
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,234
[rain falling]

230
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:33,110
[car approaches]

231
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,752
Why didn't you tell me
about the death threats?

232
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:16,023
Don't worry, sweetheart.

233
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,939
The police tell me
there's always a couple

234
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,984
in a case like this.

235
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,253
Now go back to sleep.

236
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:44,878
[sighs]

237
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,115
[phone ringing]

238
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,249
Larry, did you find
the precedent?

239
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,294
[Man speaking, faint]

240
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,296
Better watch it.

241
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,820
I got my eye on you.

242
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,735
[continues, faint]

243
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,476
You listen to me,
you stupid son of a bitch.

244
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,435
You call here again,

245
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,437
and I will find you
and break you in half.

246
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,917
Our people--

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,702
Don't you dare tell me
about our people.

248
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,705
My people know the difference
between right and wrong

249
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,621
and are proud of the few of us
in a position of responsibility.

250
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,797
Your people are obviously
ignorant chimpanzees

251
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,278
still swinging from the trees!

252
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,540
[phone clangs loudly]

253
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,007
Mabel?

254
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,186
Oh.

255
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,276
Go back to bed,
sweetheart.

256
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,842
I'm fine.

257
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,583
How long, Tom?

258
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:25,152
Oh, I'll be up
an hour or two.

259
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,676
That's not what I meant.

260
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,853
Oh, well, you know,
the trial will start Monday.

261
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,900
It shouldn't last
more than a week.
Don't you worry.

262
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,817
All the fools are gonna
crawl back under the rocks
they came from.

263
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,690
Now, baby, get some sleep.

264
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,954
[scoffs]

265
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:51,178
[sighs]

266
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,962
I don't see
why we need to makeLet go.

267
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,311
this stupid table bigger.

268
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,009
It's not like
anybody else is coming.Stormy!

269
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,880
[gasps]

270
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,970
The leaf in the table
lets you know it's a holiday,

271
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:01,579
right?

272
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,629
Dear Lord, thank you
for this food
we are about to receive

273
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:10,501
on this Thanksgiving

274
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:13,853
for the nourishment
of our bodies and our souls.

275
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,506
Amen.

276
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,160
[Mabel, Kids]
Amen.

277
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,076
Stormy made the turkey.

278
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,991
She did?Mm-hmm.

279
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,951
[Woman]
The district manager--
he says he can see Joe

280
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,953
taking his place
in just a couple of years.

281
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,128
Mmm.

282
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,957
Joe-- has he been,
uh, working out?

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,177
[purrs]
I saw him washing
the car the other day,

284
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,787
[Tina] Oh, no....and it looked like
he was gonna

285
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:40,314
bust right out of his shirt,
but it stayed on.

286
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:41,271
Oh, I was really hot.

287
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,883
Luisa,
you need to watch her.

288
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,407
Oh, whatever.
You're having sex.

289
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,844
I haven't had any
in a couple years.

290
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,150
Let's talk
about something else.

291
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,892
I'm gonna say what I said
to you last year,

292
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,981
'cause I'm not good
at this hard sell, and--

293
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,113
Yeah, you're pretty bad
at that.

294
00:14:57,157 --> 00:15:00,421
Thank you for
the vote of confidence.Mm-hmm.

295
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:04,164
I use the products.
They're just as good
as the name-brand products.

296
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,297
They're not as expensive,
which is also a plus.

297
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,299
And, uh, if you decide

298
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,214
you wanna buy some this year,
wonderful.

299
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,825
If you decide you don't
wanna buy some this year,
that's fine, too.

300
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:17,090
I'm just very happy
to have you all here.

301
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:17,786
Aw.Aw, Mable.

302
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,962
You know, with, uh...

303
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,703
Especially with
the trial, you know?

304
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:22,834
To Mabel.

305
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,488
Mm-hmm. To Mabel.To Mabel.

306
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,014
Well, you can put me down
for that detergent.

307
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,581
I love the way
it makes my sheets smell.

308
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,888
Isn't that what Ray's
supposed to say about you?Don't worry about Ray.

309
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,152
Did you get
that yeast infection
taken care of?

310
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:38,589
Why do you have to bring it up
in front of ev--
What's wrong with you?

311
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,808
You were scratching.It was a minor rash.

312
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,158
[doorbell rings]I'll get it.

313
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,947
Hector. You looking
for your mommy?

314
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,994
Papi says, um,
come home now.

315
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,822
That bastard's got
that racist bastard off.

316
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Mabel.

317
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:01,003
Joe, he--

318
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,614
What? He got off?Oh.

319
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,836
Why this restaurant?
And tonight of all nights?

320
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,012
I mean,
this is so public.

321
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,971
That's the point, my love.

322
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,755
We're here to celebrate.

323
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:17,715
[Tommy-Two]
Is Daddy a famous genius now?

324
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,459
[Tom]
Why, yes, Handsome Harry, he is.

325
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,333
Tommy-Two, slow down.

326
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,683
You're acting like you never
ate cake before.

327
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,859
[muffled] Never had cake
and my own steak before.Oh!

328
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,861
And your mouth is full.

329
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,124
Leave the boy in peace.
He's just excited.

330
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,039
Did you see
what was in his mouth?

331
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,041
Cake?

332
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,391
You know, Dr. Spock
never raised black children.

333
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,045
That's all I'm saying.

334
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,829
Check, please.

335
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,702
Oh, uh, the gentleman over there
took care of it.

336
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,669
Well, I'll be goddamned.

337
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,889
99 percent positive
that they'll start

338
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:04,327
a criminal division,
and I'm it, honey.

339
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,894
Yeah?Yeah.

340
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:09,332
In a year from now,
I'll be a partner.Ooh!

341
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,074
In three years from now,
I'll be a judge.Ooh!

342
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,208
You can go on and enroll
that boy in karate class.Oh!

343
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,079
Oh, Tom! Tom!Yeah.

344
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,691
Then go back down to Malley's

You know he can't fight.

418
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:27,449

So, they put you in charge,
did they?

429
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:07,837
[chuckles]You must be praying they don't
break any of the lamps.

430
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,536
Well, it's kind of too late
for that now.

431
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,059
But I must tell you,

432
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,497

454
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,682
Come on, Quentin.

455
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:15,426
It's just like
you're holding-- see--

456
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,777
two pencils
at the same time.

457

Daddy, I'm starving.Mmm.

458
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:22,259
Tom, you don't need
to teach him how
to use those now.

459
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:25,262
The boy's been helping me
unpack all day.

460
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,917
Angel, we're in
the big leagues now.

465
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:44,804
There's no Luisa Rodriguez

466
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,632
There are hardly any Jews.

467
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,069
These are the Whitneys
and the Biddles,

468
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,114
the last names you see
on buildings.

469
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,116

their pants on

470
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,031
one leg at a time
just like us.

471
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,903

We're Baptist.

476
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,697
Uh-uh. Darling,

477
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,699
the nearest Baptist church

478
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,615

[thinking] 
Sweet Jesus, keep me 
near the cross.

480
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:19,055
And you said it yourself.
It's the same God.

481
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,275
Look, you know,
it's a great way

482
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:24,626
to get to know the neighbors.

483
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,497
Just try it.
If you don't like it,

484
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,414
we'll-- we'll attend
somewhere else, okay?

485
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,286
All right.

486
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,203

493
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:55,657
It's that odd woman
from next door.

494

She came to say hello today.[Jean]
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry!

495
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,881
Tom, I think
he's trying to kill her.
We should call the police.

496
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:05,362
If calling the police
would help,

497
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:08,104
one of the other neighbors
would've done it years ago.

such a hard time 
being ratified?

869
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:22,464
Is it finally dead 
in the water?

870
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:25,293
Is it unnecessary 
as some critics charge?

871
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:26,947
Are women already equal?

872
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:30,124
And if not, what would 
that equality look like?

873
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,779
Our guests today 
both feel very passionately 
about this subject,

874
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:37,088
so stay tuned for a lively, 
vigorous debate.

875
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:39,917
[Woman] 
It is made of 
an amazing space-age polymer.

876
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,700
You'll be julienning 
vegetables like--

877
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:50,318
Hi, Sam.

878
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:55,541
Hey, Mrs. S.

879
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:57,586
That rack of lamb--
did I lie?

880
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,719
Oh, it was like butter, Sam.

881
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:02,243
But right now
I need two fillets.

882
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,202
My dearest friend
is coming to see me,

883
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:05,812
and I want
to really treat her.

884
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,857
You got it.

885
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:14,212
How's that?

886
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,475
Wonderful.

887
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:17,911
[thinking] Why didn't he 
wipe that sausage

888
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,045
off his hands 
before he touched my meat?

889
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:22,481
Would he have done that 
to a white woman?

890
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,660
Mabel, you're starting
to sound like Tom.

891
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:39,715
Hey.
[laughs]

892
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:44,982
Girl, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

893
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,679
Hey, can I have that?

894
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:49,595
Is that for me?
Thank you.

895
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:52,293
Let's go over here
and see your mommy.

896
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:52,990
You're early.

897
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,643
Hey, we just got here.

898
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,865
Hey.
[laughing]

899
00:49:58,908 --> 00:49:59,953
Wow.

900
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,956
I forgot.
This is really not that far.

901
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,740
No, it's not far at all.

902
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:07,134
Now, look, let me put
the car away,Okay.

903
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:09,136
and we'll go in the front door
like real company.

904
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,616
Okay, okay. Come on, baby.Okay? You ready?

905
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:12,487
Oh!Hmm?

906
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:13,923
Can I try?Oh, yeah.

907
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,838
I saw one of these
on Dallas.

908
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:17,623
Well, hit it on
the right-hand side.

909
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,059
This right here?No, top.

910
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:21,061
Top. Okay, baby, come.
Let's do it together.

911
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,194
Right here.
I'm gonna push it.

912
00:50:23,237 --> 00:50:24,804
[gasps]
Look at that!

913
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:26,806
I tell you,
there's nothing better

914
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,156
than when they go down
for a nap.

915
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,811
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

916
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:35,206
Tina, I'm so glad
you're here.
Mmm.

917
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:38,383
You know, we cannot let
this amount of time
go by ever again.

918
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:39,862
I mean,
it's simply criminal.

919
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,473
[chuckles]

920
00:50:41,516 --> 00:50:43,388
I miss you, too.

921
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,477
The streets just ain't
the same without you.

922
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,565
What do you call
this cheese again?

923
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,871
It's called Brie.

924
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:50,917
It's spelled Bry,
but I don't know why.

925
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,267
Anyway, it's fabulous,
because all you have to do

926
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,357
is put it into the microwave
for about 30 seconds,

927
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:58,142
and it comes out
soft like butter.

928
00:50:58,185 --> 00:51:00,013
We don't have a microwave.

929
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,928
Well, you don't have to
have a microwave.

930
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,843
I mean, it's-- I don't see
what the big deal is.

931
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,062
I'm just saying that you--

932
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:09,457
Rosie, can we get
those steaks, please?

933
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,416
[whispering]
Come here.

934
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,679
How much do you have to pay
to have a maid like that?

935
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:16,160
Child, you don't even
wanna know.

936
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:17,726
Mmm.Mm-hmm.

937
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,945
Hmm.

938
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:20,425
More Brie?

939
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:23,341
Bry.
[laughing]

940
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:25,952
You don't know
how much I've missed
the taste of meat.

941
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:29,173
Whenever I'm in the car
without Ray, I swear to God,

942
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:31,784
I slow to a crawl
in front of every McDonald's.

943
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:34,526
Get outta here.Yeah. Swear to God.

944
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:37,311
Let me tell you
how happy I am

945
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:38,747
to be with someone who
really appreciates good food.

946
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,662
Mmm.Because every time
I go to lunch

947
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:43,143
with these ladies,

948
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:45,276
they order cottage cheese
and Tab.

949
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:46,451
No!

950
00:51:46,494 --> 00:51:47,539
Yes.

951
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:49,280
Well, that must be why
them white women

952
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,499
always going around with
their nose so squinched up.

953
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,762
Trying to block
them good food odors

954
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:54,720
from reminding them
what they're missing.

955
00:51:54,763 --> 00:51:56,809
That must be the reason.

956
00:51:56,852 --> 00:51:57,940
That must be the truth.
[laughing]

957
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:02,119
And what is this craziness
with Ray?

958
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:04,121
Telling people
that the Ethiopians

959
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,644
found a time warp
or something?

960
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:10,257
Craziness?

961
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:12,085
Well, yeah.
When you...

962
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,870
No--

963
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,525
Remember when
you called me, and...

964
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:20,746
I said he was trying
to educate his coworkers

965
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:24,228
to the amazing achievement
of the African--

966
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:27,056
things the white powers that be
hid from us for centuries--

967
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,147
when his nasty Irish boss,
in front of everybody,

968
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,149
told him to shut the fuck up.

969
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,194
What?

970
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,370
Mm-hmm.See? That's what I'm--

971
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:38,807
That's-- You know that's
what I'm talking about.

972
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:42,333
Because you just don't know

973
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,857
how these white people
are going to respond
to anything.

974
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,904
I'm telling you, you know,
I-- I think Ray was crazy--

975
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:52,386
you know, crazy
in those quotation marks--

976
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,519
to-- to even broach
the subject with him.

977
00:52:54,562 --> 00:52:56,521
That's my Ray.

978
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:59,132
Say good-bye.
Say good-bye-bye.

979
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,265
She's gonna fall asleep
any second now.

980
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:03,397
It was so good to see you.It was great to see you.

981
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,920
Hey, wait up, faggot!Whoa!

982
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,706
Sorry, Mrs. Spader.

983
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:09,186
Tommy-Two?

984
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:10,535
Hey, Mrs. Johnson.Hi.

985
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,712
Getting even better-looking
than your daddy.

986
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:14,800
[chuckles]

987
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:16,193
[vehicle approaching]

988
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:23,200
Hi, Mrs. Johnson.

989
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:25,202
Hey.So, like I said,

990
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:26,725
it shouldn't take us this long
to get together again.

991
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:28,770
It just doesn't
make any sense.

992
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:30,946
No, no sense at all.

993
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,254
And like you said, it's not,
uh, far to come at all.

994
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,561
No, it's not that far.

995
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:39,825
So I'll call you next week?We'll talk next week then.

996
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:40,826
All right.All right.

997
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,541
[phone ringing]

998
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:10,029
Hello. [Becka] 
You-hoo!

999
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:11,073
[laughs]

1000
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:12,988
It's me. Hi, Becka.

1001
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:13,641
How was your weekend?

1002
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:15,904
Oh!

1003
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:18,994
Oh, it was glorious.

1004
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:20,344
[inhales deeply]

1005
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:21,823
Oh, where should I start?

1006
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:24,696
Well, of course, Chas was away
at the Mayo Clinic

1007
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:26,263
getting his spastic colon
checked on,

1008
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,395
but still, I was so nervous.

1009
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:31,659
I had to take a Fiorinal 
just to get on the train.

1010
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:35,010
[laughing]
And then...

1011
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:37,361
Felipe met me in the city

1012
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:40,538
in the most
unseemly neighborhood,

1013
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:43,976
and the first thing we had to do
was go shopping

1014
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:46,195
[laughing]

1015
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,720
for undergarments for me!

1016
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:53,028
You know, the kind 
without any crotch.

1017
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:54,813
I was so excited.

1018
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:56,641
I said, 
"Well, you have to let me 
tell Mabel, 'cause she's"...

1019
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:59,905
[continues rambling]

1020
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:08,217
I bought red ones, 
and pink ones,

1021
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:10,481
and blue ones, and yellow ones,

1022
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,874
and black ones.

1023
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:15,007
Oh, they were so pretty!

1024
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,139
And I bought you a present.

1025
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,316
You are gonna be 
so surprised.

1026
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,274
But I'm not gonna 
tell you what color.

1027
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,581
[laughing] 
You have to wait to see.

1028
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:27,411
You are going 
to just love them.

1029
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:30,631
So, I told Felipe 
about my fantasy.

1030
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:33,112
You know-- You know,

1031
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:37,029
the one where I sashay
into a smoky nightclub,

1032
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:39,205
and then...
[inhales deeply]

1033
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:41,599
a dark man
starts licking my armpits.

1034
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:43,601
Oh!

1035
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:45,037
[laughs]

1036
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,649
And then, when we got back 
to the hotel,

1037
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:51,304
Felipe surprised me

1038
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,350
with a squeeze bottle

1039
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,353
of Okay Margarine.

1040
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:59,573
Oh-kay!

1041
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,227

01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:04,730
Dead, dead, dead.

1561
01:29:07,603 --> 01:29:09,909
Besides,
it's much too complicated
to go into.

1562
01:29:09,953 --> 01:29:11,824
How long has
that other colored lady

1563
01:29:11,868 --> 01:29:13,870
been living
on your street,

1564
01:29:13,913 --> 01:29:17,177
and you ain't been over
with a pot of beans?

1565
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,049
Oh, come on now, Mama.

1566
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:21,094
Have you seen her?

1567
01:29:21,138 --> 01:29:24,228
She stands out
in front of her house

1568
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:27,274
sucking neck bones
in front of everybody.

1569

[sucking]

1570
01:29:28,624 --> 01:29:31,714
Even Daddy didn't do that.

1571
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:33,846
And what about all those people
in the house?

1572
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,283
She got a hundred thousand
people in the house.

1573
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:39,243

we need in the neighborhood?

[scoffs]

1575
01:29:41,332 --> 01:29:43,160
It's too much.

1576
01:29:43,203 --> 01:29:46,511
Sweet Jesus,
keep me near the cross.

1577
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:49,296
It's time for you
to come home, girl.

1578
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:54,780
Oh, Mama,
too late for that.

1579
01:29:54,824 --> 01:29:58,741
Besides, as long as I...

1580
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,048
trust in Tom, I'll be fine.

1581
01:30:02,092 --> 01:30:03,659
Everything will be fine
as long--

1582
01:30:03,702 --> 01:30:06,183
I just gotta trust in Tom.

1583
01:30:07,663 --> 01:30:09,708
Even, you know,

1584

1585
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:20,719
I'm so tired.

I couldn't do it, honey.

about a thing, princess.

1597

They come to my courtroom
by the truckload,

1599

letting public defenders

1600
01:32:03,605 --> 01:32:05,868
read their lives
off a rap sheet.

1601
01:32:05,911 --> 01:32:07,870
Nothing to say
for themselves but,

1602
01:32:07,913 --> 01:32:10,089
"Brother Judge,
I was freebasing,

1603
01:32:10,133 --> 01:32:11,874
I was dusted."

1604
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:15,747
Every one of them--

1606

back more bent
than Stepin Fetchit.

1607
01:32:21,623 --> 01:32:24,582
A man must walk tall
when he wreaks havoc

1608
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:26,758
or leave havoc alone.

1609
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:31,154
That coon Lotto winner missed
the same point as my son--

1610
01:32:31,197 --> 01:32:34,592
the unshakeable complexity
of living a watched life.

1611
01:32:34,636 --> 01:32:37,203
We are outlined in red

1612

for which we did not pose.

1614
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,994
Some day that boy
will appreciate

1615
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:47,083
my contributions to the race,

1616
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:50,782
my sacrifice
as a life-long mole.

1617
01:32:50,826 --> 01:32:54,090
This is for my sweet Mabel.

1618
01:32:54,133 --> 01:32:56,658
And this is for my Stormy,

1619
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:59,965
trying to convince herself
she's Farrah Fawcett.

1620
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:01,619
And this is
for my seed bearer.

1621
01:33:01,663 --> 01:33:05,405
May he one day open his eyes.

1622

Here's to those wild niggers
unlucky enough

1623

to pass before my gavel.

1624

And here's
to that Crisp woman,

herself,
and her extended family.

1626
01:33:16,808 --> 01:33:18,767
May their subsequent moves

1627
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:22,031
in this black-and-white
chess game

1628

than your boy.

Tom?Mm-hmm?

1735
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,334
Tommy-Two has received
his acceptance from school.

1736
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:32,902
He needs you to sign it.What-- What--

1737
01:43:32,945 --> 01:43:34,164
Tom?

1738
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,687
[Tom]
No. Don't trust her!

1739
01:43:35,731 --> 01:43:37,559
Don't trust her! [TV continues]

1740
01:43:37,602 --> 01:43:39,387
It's not even her child.
Not her child.

1741
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:40,910
Tom,

1742
01:43:40,953 --> 01:43:44,522
Tommy-Two has received
his acceptance from school,

1743
01:43:44,566 --> 01:43:46,307
and he needs you
to sign it.

1744
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,091
He is not
going to Princeton.

1745
01:43:48,134 --> 01:43:50,746
He is going to Morehouse. [Woman] Rebecca 
was my best friend, too,

1746
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:54,880
but that didn't stop you 
from getting her pregnant.

1747
01:43:54,924 --> 01:43:57,274
If she hadn't tragically 
miscarried while she--

1748
01:43:57,318 --> 01:43:58,754
Colored Morehouse?Mm-hmm.

1749
01:43:58,797 --> 01:44:03,062
[laughing]
He's going to Princeton.

1750
01:44:03,106 --> 01:44:05,064
Tom, are you deaf?

1751
01:44:05,108 --> 01:44:06,849
He doesn't want
to go to Princeton.

1752
01:44:06,892 --> 01:44:10,592
He wants to go to Morehouse.
That's what he wants to do.

1753
01:44:10,635 --> 01:44:13,421
He wants you to sign the papers.

1754
01:44:13,464 --> 01:44:15,423
I want you to sign the papers.

1755
01:44:15,466 --> 01:44:17,686
Sign the damn papers, Tom.

1756
01:44:17,729 --> 01:44:19,731
[Doctor] 
We're both damaged goods, 
Nurse Veronica.

1757
01:44:19,775 --> 01:44:23,648
Just maybe in this crazy 
topsy-turvy world of ours--

1758
01:44:23,692 --> 01:44:25,824
Just maybe we'd grow 
to love each other enoughDo you have a pen?

1759
01:44:25,868 --> 01:44:29,915
to heal all the hurt 
we've inflicted 
upon one another.

1760
01:44:29,959 --> 01:44:31,874
[Nurse Veronica] 
Oh, Robert,

1761
01:44:31,917 --> 01:44:34,616
I promise you 
you won't be sorry.

1762
01:44:34,659 --> 01:44:36,618
We'll make something 
good and clean

1763
01:44:36,661 --> 01:44:38,141
out of what's left 
of our lives together.

1764
01:44:38,184 --> 01:44:40,578
Just wait. 
I'm going to cook more

1765
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:42,841
and take better care 
of myself, I swear.

1766
01:44:42,885 --> 01:44:47,019
I'll make you proud of me 
if it's the last thing 
I do on this earth.

1767
01:44:47,063 --> 01:44:49,195
[Robert] 
I'm already proud of you.

1768
01:44:49,239 --> 01:44:51,589
You're the best damn nurse 
I've ever had the pleasure 
of working with.

1769
01:44:51,633 --> 01:44:55,245
Are you hungry, honey?

1770
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,682
Well, if you get hungry,
you just let me know, all right?

1771
01:45:00,119 --> 01:45:02,034
Thank your father.[Tommy-Two]
Thanks, Dad.

1772
01:45:21,706 --> 01:45:24,840
See you Monday, miss.All right.

1773
01:45:28,147 --> 01:45:29,540
[dog barking]

1774
01:45:37,853 --> 01:45:38,593
Can I help you?

1775
01:45:38,636 --> 01:45:40,856
Oh.

1776
01:45:40,899 --> 01:45:44,294
I'm Inspector Wilkins,
Mrs. Spader.

1777
01:45:45,817 --> 01:45:48,603
I hope you don't mind
my cutting through your yard?

1778
01:45:48,646 --> 01:45:50,909
Well, we do have a pair
of vicious dogs.

1779
01:45:50,953 --> 01:45:52,302
I'd hate
to see you get hurt.

1780

Occupational hazard.

1781
01:45:54,435 --> 01:45:56,480
While I've got you, uh,

1782
01:45:56,524 --> 01:45:59,396
could I ask if you saw anything
unusual the night of the fire?

1783
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,093
No, I can't say that we did.

1784
01:46:01,137 --> 01:46:03,182
You know, the judge and I
are such homebodies,

1785
01:46:03,226 --> 01:46:06,185
we were probably asleep
before Carson started
his monologue.

1786
01:46:06,882 --> 01:46:09,841
Speaking of the judge,
could I talk to him?

1787
01:46:09,885 --> 01:46:12,540
Not today.
I know he wants
to talk to you

1788
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:14,411
because you're both
in law enforcement,

1789
01:46:14,455 --> 01:46:16,500
but, uh, he's not feeling
particularly well.

1790
01:46:16,544 --> 01:46:18,067
He's got a spastic colon.

1791
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:23,159
Well, then, uh,
when his health improves,

1792
01:46:23,202 --> 01:46:25,291
ask him to give me a call.

1793
01:46:25,335 --> 01:46:28,425
I certainly will.
I'm gonna get back
to my baking.

1794
01:46:28,469 --> 01:46:30,427
I'm making scones.
Bye-bye.

1795

01:46:43,571 --> 01:46:47,096

01:53:39,682 --> 01:53:41,379
[chuckles]
Please.

1906
01:53:41,423 --> 01:53:43,468
You and I know
that's a big lie.

1907
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:45,340
[thinking] 
Look, if you're gonna 
say it, just say it.

1908
01:53:45,383 --> 01:53:47,298
Let's get it 
out in the open.

1909
01:53:47,342 --> 01:53:48,865
I is from the deep South.

1910
01:53:48,909 --> 01:53:50,258
I know how they do.

1911
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:53,130
But I'm almost glad about it,
really. Mm-hmm.

1912
01:53:53,174 --> 01:53:54,566
I was almost starting to think

1913
01:53:54,610 --> 01:53:56,220
here up north
they're gonna act different.

1914
01:53:56,264 --> 01:53:59,920
No, baby.
These uppity white folk--
they did me a favor.

1915
01:53:59,963 --> 01:54:01,965
Now, like my granddaddy
used to say,

1916
01:54:02,009 --> 01:54:04,707
it's better to set
your alarm off in the morning
than in the afternoon.

1917
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:06,665
I don't know
what the hell it mean.
He was a drinker, girl.

1918
01:54:06,709 --> 01:54:09,973
[chuckles]
Well, anyway,

1919
01:54:10,017 --> 01:54:11,540
now, I know I ain't been
the friendliest of neighbors,

1920
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:14,238
but I was wondering

1921
01:54:14,282 --> 01:54:16,371
if y'all could use
some of this stuff.

1922
01:54:16,414 --> 01:54:20,070
Now, this is real good
when you run out of bleach
to clean your toilets.

1923
01:54:20,114 --> 01:54:22,507
I thought you were
a millionaire.

1924
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:25,119
I am, and I intend
on staying one.

1925
01:54:25,162 --> 01:54:26,990
See, plenty of colored folks
hit the number

1926
01:54:27,034 --> 01:54:27,773
but die in the poorhouse.

1927
01:54:27,817 --> 01:54:29,775
That ain't gonna be me.

1928
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:31,908
No, it's not.

1929
01:54:31,952 --> 01:54:35,390
You know, I-- I used to love
how that made my sheets smell.

1930
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,741
I can't remember
why I stopped using it.

1931
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:42,266
Go on, girl.
Get yourself a whiff.

1932
01:54:47,532 --> 01:54:48,490
It's like old times.

1933
01:54:48,533 --> 01:54:51,014
[laughs]

1934
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:53,756
Well, as long
as I got you here...
Mmm.

1935
01:54:53,799 --> 01:54:56,672
And this rat's nest--
this is the reason why
I didn't even

1936
01:54:56,715 --> 01:54:59,718
try to find
a Baptist church yesterday.

1937
01:54:59,762 --> 01:55:01,503
Now, where in the hell
can a speck

1938
01:55:01,546 --> 01:55:02,460
get her hair pressed
around here?

1939
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:07,683
A speck can't get her hair
pressed around here.

1940
01:55:07,726 --> 01:55:09,685
We have to go all the way
to Bridgeport.

1941
01:55:09,728 --> 01:55:12,862
But you know what?
I found a marvelous girl.

1942
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:14,081
I'll give you
her phone number.

1943
01:55:14,124 --> 01:55:17,693
Oh, well, I appreciate that,
Mrs. Spader.

1944
01:55:17,736 --> 01:55:19,347
Now, look, I'm gonna
get outta here.

1945
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:21,262
I'm gonna leave
this order form with you.

1946
01:55:21,305 --> 01:55:22,306
Oh.Just fill it out.

1947
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,004
Take your time.
No pressure at all.

1948
01:55:24,047 --> 01:55:24,874
All right.All right, girl.

1949
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:27,094
You know,

1950
01:55:27,137 --> 01:55:30,401
this has really been nice
having you here, Ruth.

1951
01:55:30,445 --> 01:55:33,361
I was just about to say
the same thing, Mabel.Mmm.

1952
01:55:33,404 --> 01:55:35,406
You know,
that's my cousin's name.No.

1953
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:37,278
Mm-hmm.You know,
I got a Aunt Sissy Ruth.

1954
01:55:37,321 --> 01:55:39,236
She's up there in Illinois.Mm-hmm.

1955
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,369
She makes the best neck bones
you ever tasted.

1956
01:55:41,412 --> 01:55:44,241
Ooh, I have not
had good neck bones
since I moved up here.

1957
01:55:44,285 --> 01:55:46,417
Well, then, you know
what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get the recipe.

1958
01:55:46,461 --> 01:55:47,984
I'm gonna hold you to it.All right.

1959
01:55:48,028 --> 01:55:49,072
All right now.

1960
01:55:49,116 --> 01:55:53,685
Um, I'm just about
to make some coffee.

1961
01:55:53,729 --> 01:55:55,644
You want to join me?

1962
01:55:55,687 --> 01:55:58,386
That's mighty nice of you.

1963
01:55:58,429 --> 01:55:59,604
Sure.

1964
01:55:59,648 --> 01:56:02,303
[Tom]
Hey, baby.Yeah?

1965
01:56:02,346 --> 01:56:03,739
[Tom]
Who was that?

1966
01:56:03,782 --> 01:56:05,349
Go on back to sleep, Tom.

1967
01:56:05,393 --> 01:56:07,961
I'll bring up
your lunch later.

1968
01:56:09,745 --> 01:56:12,139
I tell you, she made
the best neck bones.

1969
01:56:12,182 --> 01:56:14,315
Mm-hmm.
The kind that you suck
all the meat out of?

1970
01:56:14,358 --> 01:56:16,534
All the meat, all the marrow--And the juices
running down your arm?

1971
01:56:16,578 --> 01:56:18,232
Listen, you suck
that neck bone so bad,

1972
01:56:18,275 --> 01:56:20,277
its mama starts to cry.Oh, stop it.

1973
01:56:20,321 --> 01:56:21,452
You know what I mean?Yeah.

1974
01:56:21,496 --> 01:56:22,410
