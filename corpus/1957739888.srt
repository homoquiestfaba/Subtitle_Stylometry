543
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,598
[birds chirping]

544
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,318
[exhaling]

545
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,300
[exhaling]

546
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:04,612
[knocking]

547
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,719
[sniffing]

548
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:16,123
Holy shit.

549
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,826
[woman] Who's there?

550
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,461
Uh, no one.
Uh, I'll be right back.

551
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,836
Marcus!
How are you, man?

552
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,404
[chuckling]

553
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,339
How are you?

554
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,543
I'm good, man.
I mean, uh...

555
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,845
a couple grays lately
'cause of the kids,

556
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,279
but I can't complain.

557
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:40,515
[Marcus laughing]

558
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,383
Wow. Hey.

559
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:45,753
Look at her.
Are they talking yet?

560
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,254
[chuckling]

561
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,289
Hey, it's been a while,
my friend.

562
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:51,124
There's a strange man
at the door.

563
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:54,696
- Oh, damn. Uh. Just... give...
- [Becka] What strange man?

564
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,764
- Oh.
- Oh. Look. Look, hon.

565
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,432
- [Becka groaning]
- Look who's here.

566
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,535
It's Marcus.

567
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:02,169
Of course, I know who he is.

568
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:03,838
Do you think
I'm going to forget him?

569
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,707
- Hi.
- What do you want?

570
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,644
I... Becka, come on.
We haven't seen him in, like...

571
00:35:09,677 --> 00:35:11,679
Not like, Matt.
Seven years.

572
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,715
Hey, there you are!

573
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,315
Come on,
I want to introduce you guys.

574
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,751
Hi.
My name is Jackson.

575
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:17,885
Hi, Jackson.

576
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:21,154
So we met
when you were just a baby.

577
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:22,757
You were just born,

578
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,926
and I was
the third person to hold you,

579
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,426
after your mom and dad.

580
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,228
What brings you
back here, Marcus?

581
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,632
And you, Bella.

582
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,634
Last time I saw you,
you were just

583
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,901
learning how to walk.

584
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:42,376
So, did you guys know
that Gaby is pregnant?

585
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,913
Of course we do.
I'm surprised you do.

586
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:48,448
I was hoping to see her.

587
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,460
Marcus, you can't just come
back around here like this.

588
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,044
Okay, just...
Excuse us, Marcus, just...

589
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,358
- Okay?
- Okay.

590
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,260
Come on, guys.
Let's go back inside.

591
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,197
[door slams shut]

592
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:05,365
[exhaling]

593
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,468
Hey, you want to come inside?
Have you eaten?

594
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:10,571
So, um, what was that all about?

595
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,406
Ah...

596
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,709
she's still
a little bitter, man.

597
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:15,877
Yeah, clearly.

598
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,378
What did you say to her?

599
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,583
Look, don't worry about that.
Join us for dinner.

600
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,719
I'm sure
there's a lot to catch up on.

601
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:35,730
[video game
clicking and whirring]

602
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:48,375
Oh, sorry, man, I...
I forget that's even there.

603
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,343
How does she seem?

604
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:51,979
What do you mean?

605
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,515
She happy with him?

606
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,517
You talking about Rich?

607
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:01,589
Yeah. Rich.

608
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:03,423
Well, he's just that. Rich.

609
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:06,259
Babe, come on.
Is that really necessary?

610
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,328
Ugh. Come on, kids.
Time for dinner.

611
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,366
[Matt]
Come, Marcus, sit down.

612
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,608
We can't eat
until everybody's sitting.

613
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,643
[chuckling]

614
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,616
You know, I'm not going to
hide things from you anymore.

615
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,818
I couldn't care
less about your feelings.

616
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:32,987
Beer?

617
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,555
Yeah.

618
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:38,992
[Becka]
You sure that's a good idea?

619
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,461
You know,
with your "condition."

620
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,497
- Condition?
- [Becka] Yeah.

621
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,365
- Condition?
- [kids giggling]

622
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:46,534
She did it again.

623
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,569
[both] "Condition! Condition!"

624
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,437
[kids laughing]

625
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,815
- Did she do it to again?
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

626
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,340
- Did I miss it?
- [laughing]

627
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:55,076
Okay, okay.
Can we eat now?

628
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:56,611
"Okay, okay.
Can we eat now?"

629
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,311
[kids laughing]

630
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,090
[Becka] All right, settle down.
Start eating.

631
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,582
[Matt]
Babe, you can't blame them.

632
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:02,776
You did the air quotes again.

633
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,653
Uh, yeah.

634
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:08,421
You were still at Parkman
& Taylor's then, right?

635
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,524
Yeah. [chuckling]

636
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:11,993
What wasted years.

637
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,731
- Oh!
- Goodnight, Dad.

638
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:17,832
Goodnight, sweetie.

639
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,635
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Night, bud.

640
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,004
Do you know who Denzel is?

641
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:25,773
[laughing]

642
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:28,009
Do you know who Denzel is?

643
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,410
Of course, "King Kong
ain't got nothing on me!"

644
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,789
- [laughing]
- All right, all right.

645
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:32,980
Just get to your room.

646
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,483
Doesn't he remind you
of Denzel, Dad?

647
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:39,587
Would you... j...
Go, go. [laughing]

648
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:41,756
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,858
I'm sure that came off
a little racist. [chuckling]

650
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:46,861
No, no, no, not at all.
I actually get that a lot.

651
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:48,796
What blows my mind, though,

652
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,767
is that a... a 7-year-old knows
anything about <i>Training Day.</i>

653
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,603
Oh, yeah, no,
he loves going through my DVDs

654
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,470
and sneaking off
films here and there.

655
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,640
I'm just glad he didn't
put the "shit" part in.

656
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:02,810
[both laughing]

657
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,115
Yeah. He's pretty good.
Animated, too.

658
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:11,052
You're blessed, man.

659
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:13,588
You've got amazing kids.

660
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:17,058
Ah, so where are
you staying tonight?

661
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:22,763
Yeah, that'll be
at the old Dodge Estates.

662
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:27,101
Um, down the block
at the supermarket parking lot.

663
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,070
What? No, man.

664
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,014
No, you're staying in the...
In the office tonight.

665
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,807
There's still a bed in there.

666
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,585
No, no, no, I... I don't want
to intrude any further.

667
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:35,743
Oh, stop it.

668
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:36,911
Stop what?

669
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,948
Uh, no, I was
just offering Marcus

670
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,683
the office for the night.

671
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:45,519
He just... he doesn't
have any place to stay, so.

672
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:47,021
Why don't you
call the Budget Inn?

673
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,488
They probably have hourly rates.

674
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:52,159
A clear sign
I've overstayed my welcome.

675
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:55,462
No, stop. Stop!

676
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,967
It's just for a night.
All right?

677
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,636
All he's trying
to do is see Gaby.

678
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:03,537
- What's the big deal?
- If Sheila finds out,

679
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,982
you know the trouble
that's going to cause me?

680
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,574
How often do you speak to her?

681
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:08,475
Often.

682
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:09,744
Not as much as before,

683
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,078
now that she's
always on the move

684
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,546
with her new family
and everything.

685
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,181
But considering,
a few times a month.

686
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:17,184
You know, Marcus,

687
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:19,587
Sheila and I have been
friends since I was a kid.

688
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:21,956
We've always
protected each other.

689
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:24,592
She was the one to stand up
and walk me down the aisle

690
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,225
when my dad
was a no show at our wedding.

691
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:29,864
There's no way you
or you are going to convince me

692
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,933
to stand against her here.

693
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,835
When was the last time
you spoke with Gaby?

694
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,070
Just last week.

695
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,505
And she's fine,
no thanks to you.

696
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,875
When's the last time
Sheila spoke with Gaby?

697
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:42,076
I don't know.

698
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,711
Well, I'm willing to guess

699
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:46,681
that it's before
my last conversation with her.

700
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:50,184
Look, I'm not saying that what
Sheila did to Gaby was okay.

701
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:53,187
Us, Becka. Us.
What she did to us.

702
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:56,524
Now, I understand
that she's your friend.

703
00:40:57,158 --> 00:41:00,027
And you have this overwhelming
desire to defend her.

704
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,096
But at some point,
you have to realize

705
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,864
that what she did

706
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:05,599
was indefensible.

707
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,034
Okay, guys.

708
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,036
This is going
to get out of hand.

709
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,539
So can we please...

710
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:12,852
Like, let's just
call it a night.

711
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:14,842
Okay.

712
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:18,012
Well, thank you both
for the dinner.

713
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,081
And for the distraction.

714
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:23,517
What?

715
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:25,753
The distraction.

716
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:33,194
It's the thing I look for
every damn minute of every day.

717
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,797
It's what stops my mind

718
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:39,700
from wandering
into places I hate being.

719
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:42,203
You know what the downfall

720
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:44,138
of my relationship
with Sheila was?

721
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,274
The thing that singlehandedly

722
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:49,944
destroyed my life,

723
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,145
ruined everything.

724
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,048
[machine beeping]

725
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,053
She looked at me
like I was a head case.

726
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,290
All I wanted was some medication

727
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,193
to help me...
deal with the anxiety.

728
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,163
Get some sleep.

729
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,596
Why didn't you just go
see a shrink?

730
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:12,066
It was almost midnight.

731
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,935
Not many of them available then.

732
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:19,640
All I tried to do
is to get myself some help.

733
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:26,047
The doctor felt
I was a danger to myself

734
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,615
and had me Baker Acted.

735
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:29,917
At first she was...

736
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:33,120
upset, mostly because
I didn't tell her.

737
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:37,056
I didn't tell her because
I was mostly embarrassed.

738
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,026
Embarrassed.

739
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:41,228
Of what?

740
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:42,663
I don't know
what was wrong with me.

741
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:47,868
There I was
with the perfect relationship,

742
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:51,238
an amazing job
and a phenomenal daughter.

743
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:58,345
And then I learned
that my insurance did not cover

744
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:00,181
mental health conditions.

745
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:05,186
Have any idea what it costs
for a four day stay

746
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:07,121
in a mental health hospital,

747
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:11,325
especially after you factor in
the daily meds and blood work?

748
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,929
It's an insane amount of money.

749
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,331
It's not something you just pay,

750
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:19,066
even if you have a great job.

751
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:22,670
For months, I fought
with the insurance company

752
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,271
in my job over this.

753
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:28,008
At the end of which,
they saw the need to let me go.

754
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,013
What followed
were collection, bills,

755
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:34,115
bankruptcy.

756
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,717
The loss of our home.

757
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:38,886
And our vehicles.

758
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,323
And then her.

759
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:46,994
She'd had enough.
So she left.

760
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,899
All because
I tried to get some help.

761
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:55,669
Ever wonder why
more people don't seek help,

762
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:58,405
why so many people just end it?

763
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:02,877
It's because it's harder
than calling the 800 number.

764
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,745
It takes a hell
of a lot more than that.

765
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:10,784
I determined that I would
never try to get help again.

766
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:13,854
I find distractions to be...

767
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,257
More helpful.

768
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,027
And the last few hours
here with your family

769
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,996
has been a wonderful distraction

770
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,664
for which I am most grateful.

771
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,435
I know this may sound selfish...

772
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:31,438
but it's not meant that way.

773
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:33,874
Finding Gaby.

774
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:36,744
And doing everything
that I can to help her...

775
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:40,281
would be
the ultimate distraction.

776
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:46,854
Marcus, just take the office.

777
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:49,957
I got to tell you,
if you hurt that girl again,

778
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,950
I'm going to make your
battle a little bit easier.

779
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:55,696
Thank you.

780
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,064
Thank you both.

781
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,208
Why didn't you come to me, man?

782
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:11,745
I really
didn't know any of that.

783
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,249
I just knew you were
going through some stuff.

784
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:20,788
Seriously, if you ever
get to that point again...

785
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:23,090
please call me.

786
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:29,029
Thank you, my friend.
I appreciate it.

787
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:32,534
[Matt sighing]

788
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:36,136
[sorrowful instrumental]

789
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:52,920
[sighing]

790
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:56,457
I know, I know.

791
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,059
[sighing]
What would you have me do?

792
00:46:01,996 --> 00:46:03,097
I barely got here.

793
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:07,201
I only got, like,
about $10 to my name.

794
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,304
[sighing] Thinking
about selling the truck.

795
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:13,040
I don't know.

796
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:17,945
The bus.
Maybe I'd pick up a bike.

797
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:21,949
Of course I do!

798
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,218
You don't forget
that sort of stuff.

799
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:31,191
Wait a minute.

800
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:38,932
[Marcus] Hey, man.

801
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:41,068
[Jackson] Hi, do you have
imaginary friends, too?

802
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:44,104
[chuckling]
So you heard all that, huh?

803
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:46,106
Yeah, well, I suppose I do.

804
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,942
You have voices
talking to you, too?

805
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:51,211
Sometimes, they get me
in trouble a lot.

806
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:53,080
Really? How so?

807
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:55,115
Well, they told me
to come out here

808
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:56,950
and find out
who you're talking to.

809
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,085
[chuckling]

810
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,621
They did, did they?

811
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:02,089
I know how to ride a bike.
Want me to teach you?

812
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:04,358
Yeah, well, thanks, buddy,

813
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:07,361
but I don't think I'll need
to ride one just yet.

814
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,963
I have some money
you can borrow.

815
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,365
[laughing]

816
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:13,535
You have been listening
for a while, huh?

817
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:16,170
Well, the walls
are pretty thin, but I do.

818
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:18,339
I have $10 just like you.

819
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:20,007
Well, listen, buddy,
thanks a lot,

820
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,110
but you go ahead
and hold on to that, all right?

821
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:25,012
But I'll tell you this:

822
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:28,382
That's the nicest thing
that anyone has tried to do

823
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,085
for me in a... a very long time.

824
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:33,921
It just seemed
like you're having a problem.

825
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:36,390
Well, I am. I am.

826
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:37,991
The kind of problem
I'm having, though,

827
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:40,361
is not the kind
that money can fix.

828
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:45,499
Having good people like
you and your family around,

829
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:46,934
that helps an awful lot.

830
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:49,571
Well, we're here for you,
but not right now,

831
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,005
because I'm going
to get "busted."

832
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:54,609
[Marcus laughing]

833
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,277
[sighing happily]

834
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,389
[birds chirping]

835
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:11,492
[kids talking distantly]

836
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:15,630
[Jackson] You went yesterday!

837
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:17,464
[Bella] You went yesterday!

838
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:19,008
- [Jackson] No, you did!
- [Matt] All right, quiet down.

839
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:20,300
Jackson's going to go first.

840
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:21,935
[Bella] Aw, that's not fair!

841
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:24,338
Do the shoe.

842
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:27,675
Do the hike.

843
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:31,445
Do the dab.

844
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:35,015
Do the worm.

845
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:40,688
Do the... take the I.

846
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:44,592
Oh, man.

847
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:48,095
[exhaling heavily]

848
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:50,330
Hey, there he is!
Did the kids wake you?

849
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:54,234
You know how long it's been
since I've been awakened

850
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,604
by the voices of kids

851
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:59,206
screaming and yelling?

852
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:00,508
I'm sorry, man.

853
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,710
I kept telling them
to quiet down!

854
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:06,013
No, no, no.
It's been quite refreshing.

855
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:09,183
It's actually something
I've really missed.

856
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,387
Where's Becka?

857
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:15,422
Oh, she's working today.

858
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:16,667
Here... why don't you
get some coffee?

859
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,425
There's mugs on the rack there.

860
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,659
- Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
- [Bella] Ride the donkey.

861
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,207
I have not slept
that much in ages.

862
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,642
Really?

863
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:36,711
You only got,
like, five or six hours.

864
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:41,215
Yeah, well,
it's usually two, three tops.

865
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:42,717
Whoa, black, huh?

866
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,652
There is cream
and sugar, you know.

867
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:46,588
What, do you think
I'm one of those guys

868
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:48,188
who would violate
his coffee like that?

869
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,558
- [both chuckling]
- No, not anymore.

870
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:53,494
So what are they
doing back there?

871
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,399
I believe that specific
move is the shoe.

872
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,235
- [Marcus] Hmm.
- I don't know.

873
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:02,570
What's that one called, Jax?

874
00:50:02,604 --> 00:50:04,171
This one's called the hike.

875
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:05,707
What's a shoe?

876
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,308
That's not what it's called.

877
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:11,546
Sorry that I'm not up
to speed on the latest moves.

878
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:15,617
See, to me, this was the best.

879
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,784
What?

880
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:19,286
The best part of my life.

881
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,557
Watching my little girl
being a little girl.

882
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:24,526
Worry-free.

883
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:29,029
Totally oblivious
to the negativity of the world.

884
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:33,367
Look, man,
I don't want to cross any lines

885
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,068
or make you feel any worse,

886
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:39,072
but don't you think
you were a major part

887
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:41,074
of Gaby's introduction
to that negativity?

888
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,378
I need to find her, Matt.

889
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:48,550
Any chance you know
where I should be looking?

890
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,818
Oh.

891
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,155
Come on, man,
Becka will... will not know

892
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,558
that I found out through you.

893

01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:11,025
Now's the time
to tell me if this man

1070
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:12,393
is a threat to you or your baby.

1071
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,129
He's not.

1072
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:16,574
I just haven't seen him
in a really long time

1073
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:18,074
and we didn't really
end off on good terms.

1074
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:19,166
You know what I mean?

1075
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:21,235
I was kind of surprised

1076
01:03:21,268 --> 01:03:22,345
that he popped
up here out of nowhere.

1077
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:24,138
Man, he looks like shit.

1078
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:25,616
Actually, looks better
than the last time I saw him.

1079
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,241
[both chuckle]

1080
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:29,143
All right, well,
get him off the street.

1081
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:31,178
And please
don't put yourself at risk.

1082
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:32,623
If you feel like
he's a danger to you,

1083
01:03:32,647 --> 01:03:33,947
you give us a call immediately.

1084
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:35,517
No, he's no danger.

1085
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,151
Usually he's in danger.

1086
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:40,154
Right, you have yourself
a good night, ma'am.

1087
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:41,547
- Thanks.
- Have a good night, sir.

1088
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,964
So can I, um...
Can I come in now?

1089
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:53,267
I don't care.

1090
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:00,074
[engine sound receding]

1091
01:04:02,409 --> 01:04:03,511
I told you it would work.

1092
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:06,313
Yeah.

1093
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:08,449
But whose idea was it

1094
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:09,551
to call the cops?

1095
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:10,918
[scoffing]

1096
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:12,019
[chair thudding]

1097
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:14,388
[trunk slams]

1098
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:41,081
[somber sigh]

1099
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,218
That was six months ago.

1100
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:51,225
- Gaby, I didn't know.
- How would you?

1101
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:53,628
You haven't called me
in seven years.

1102
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:56,130
Last I heard,
you were in Ma it land

1103
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:57,297
or Sanford, or something.

1104
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,101
You know I didn't...

1105
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:03,356
leave because of you, right?

1106
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:06,273
Right.
You left 'cause of you.

1107
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,976
Or mom, or money,

1108
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:10,978
or your friends
or lack thereof, or whatever.

1109
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:12,647
But you left, Dad.

1110
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:15,015
You left at a time when a girl

1111
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:16,116
needs her father the most.

1112
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:17,251
You left me.

1113
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:24,592
[he sniffles]

1114
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:27,928
[he exhales sharply]

1115
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:32,600
[Marcus sighs]

1116
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,141
[exhales hard]

1117
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:46,480
I'm sorry, Gaby.

1118
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,584
I know
it doesn't mean an awful lot

1119
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,084
to you right now, but I am.

1120
01:05:55,657 --> 01:05:56,724
When your mother left...

1121
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,260
a feeling came over me.

1122
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,361
A feeling unlike

1123
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:04,198
anything I've ever
experienced before.

1124
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:05,299
And you knew.

1125
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,001
You knew
what I was going through.

1126
01:06:09,169 --> 01:06:10,237
I was angry.

1127
01:06:11,573 --> 01:06:14,408
It was angry at life,
the world...

1128
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,144
anything, everything.

1129
01:06:18,513 --> 01:06:19,581
I was overwhelmed.

1130
01:06:20,582 --> 01:06:22,349
With voices in my head.

1131
01:06:22,382 --> 01:06:24,418
Voices yelling, screaming.

1132
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:28,723
Trying to persuade me to do...

1133
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:30,592
horrible...

1134
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:33,060
unimaginable things.

1135
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:35,697
So I put myself in a place.

1136
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:39,433
A place where
the only person I could harm

1137
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:40,568
would be me.

1138
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,404
And not my little girl.

1139
01:06:48,242 --> 01:06:49,409
I was ashamed, Gaby.

1140
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:51,078
I was ashamed of who I was.

1141
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:52,747
I was ashamed...

1142
01:06:53,848 --> 01:06:55,315
of what I'd become.

1143
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:57,117
So you left me alone.

1144
01:06:58,352 --> 01:06:59,587
Two months after my...

1145
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:03,490
[sobbing]

1146
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:07,261
What do you think that does

1147
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,530
to a 19-year-old girl?

1148
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:16,069
[sobbing, exhaling]

1149
01:07:16,738 --> 01:07:19,406
Have I, uh,
congratulated you yet?

1150
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:22,677
I would have, um,

1151
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,713
I would have brought
something, a gift, but...

1152
01:07:25,747 --> 01:07:28,115
Yeah, I got it.
No worries.

1153
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,218
Is this your second?
I saw...

1154
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,122
- I saw the pictures.
- I lost it.

1155
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,158
Like I said, you have no idea

1156
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:39,259
what I've been through.

1157
01:07:40,294 --> 01:07:41,361
[somber sigh]

1158
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:44,766
I'm so damn stupid.

1159
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,535
I keep making these decisions,

1160
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:48,929
thinking I'm doing
the right thing.

1161
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:54,676
I tell myself that

1162
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:56,319
the further away from you
that I place myself,

1163
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:57,444
the better off you'll be.

1164
01:07:57,477 --> 01:07:58,580
[Gaby scoffs]

1165
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:01,148
Once again, I screwed it all up.

1166
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:03,618
I'm sorry, that's bullshit.

1167
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:06,554
Excuse me?

1168
01:08:06,588 --> 01:08:08,388
You made the decision
to get help.

1169
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:10,324
You did something

1170
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:11,502
so many people are afraid to do,

1171
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:13,460
and it collapsed on top of you.

1172
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:16,363
Mom couldn't see it,
but I could.

1173
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:18,666
Even as a teenager.
[scoffs]

1174
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,568
I just wanted
to help you fight through it.

1175
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:24,438
[exhales]
Gaby, you were just a child.

1176
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:27,207
[voice breaking]
Not a naive one, Dad.

1177
01:08:28,776 --> 01:08:31,244
Losing the house was tough.

1178
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:35,817
Having no power for nights,
it was tough.

1179
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:39,319
If it wasn't for Matt and Becka,

1180
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:40,731
I don't know
how I would have made it

1181
01:08:40,755 --> 01:08:41,856
those few months.

1182
01:08:42,322 --> 01:08:43,758
And then I met James.

1183
01:08:45,893 --> 01:08:47,427
So sorry you lost him.

1184
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:50,130
I wish I had known him.

1185
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:52,165
He was you.

1186
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:54,535
Exactly like you.

1187
01:08:55,502 --> 01:08:57,437
Well, a later version, anyway.

1188
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,341
Negative in every way

1189
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,410
and always putting
everyone before himself.

1190
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:07,180
He would protect me
the way you would,

1191
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:08,516
and it kept me straight.

1192
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:12,452
Sounded like a great guy.

1193
01:09:16,557 --> 01:09:18,258
Anyway, I got to go to bed.

1194
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:20,051
I have a doctor's
appointment in the morning.

1195
01:09:20,728 --> 01:09:21,796
[both groaning]

1196
01:09:24,599 --> 01:09:25,667
Hey, could you...

1197
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:28,368
Could you, um, use some company?

1198
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:30,571
Come on.

1199
01:09:32,305 --> 01:09:34,341
Came all this way and, um,

1200
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,844
I really have
nothing else to do.

1201
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,025
Besides, you should have
someone drive you.

1202
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:42,215
And her.

1203
01:09:45,252 --> 01:09:46,286
I leave at nine.

1204
01:09:47,021 --> 01:09:48,756
- [she scoffs]
- Okay.

1205
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:50,858
Okay.

1206
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:52,927
Thanks, baby.

1207
01:09:54,629 --> 01:09:55,697
'Night, Dad.

1208
01:09:57,264 --> 01:09:59,634
[footsteps departing]

1209
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:02,570
Good night.

1210
01:10:11,779 --> 01:10:12,880
[exhausted sigh]

1211
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,484
[exhales]

1212
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:18,653
Well.

1213
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:24,892
[sighs]

1214
01:10:35,837 --> 01:10:36,904
Yeah.

1215
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:38,773
I did let her down.

1216
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,242
I know she does.

1217
01:10:45,646 --> 01:10:46,714
I don't plan to.

1218
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:49,717
[exhales]

1219
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:52,687
Good night.

1220
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:03,430
And how are we feeling today?

1221
01:11:04,599 --> 01:11:05,767
Oh.

1222
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:08,045
Excuse me, I didn't realize
that we had company.

1223
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:10,337
Hey, Dr. Foster.
This is my father.

1224
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,539
I'm Marcus.

1225
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:15,275
- Nice to meet you.
- A pleasure.

1226
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,812
This is an unexpected visit.

1227
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:19,514
You can say that again.
[exhales]

1228
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:20,948
He found out about the baby.

1229
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:24,384
So, then,
can I speak freely or...?

1230
01:11:26,754 --> 01:11:28,455
He's not really
up to speed on anything.

1231
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:30,691
Up to speed on what?

1232
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:32,999
What do you want me to do here?

1233
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:34,662
I mean, at this point,

1234
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:36,063
it doesn't matter,
it's whatever.

1235
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:38,398
Just...
Probably best if you told him.

1236
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,034
T... tell me what?

1237
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,472
Uh, well, as far as
the ultrasound goes...

1238
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,340
baby looks great.

1239
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:50,477
So what do you say that
we schedule that C-section

1240
01:11:50,511 --> 01:11:52,947
- for two weeks from tomorrow?
- C... C-section?

1241
01:11:53,648 --> 01:11:55,583
You're not doing this naturally?

1242
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:58,853
There are various reasons

1243
01:11:58,886 --> 01:12:00,453
why we have to have a C-section.

1244
01:12:01,556 --> 01:12:03,524
I'll... I'll fill you in
on a few, okay?

1245
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:04,859
Sure, of course.

1246
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,527
Gaby,
