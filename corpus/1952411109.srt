[male voice sings]

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,555
♫ Last Sunday morning ♫

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,350
♫ The sunshine
Felt like rain ♫

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:23,022
♫ The week before,
They all seemed the same ♫

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,066
♫ With the help of God
And true friends ♫

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,902
♫ I come to realize ♫

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,238
♫ I still had
Two strong legs ♫

9
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,574
♫ And even wings to fly ♫

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,703
♫ Oh, I ain't wasting
Time no more ♫

11
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,413
♫ 'Cause time goes by like ♫

12
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:44,043
♫ Like hurricanes
And faster things ♫

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,336
(woman)
We heard it on the radio.
ln the songs, you could tell

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,505
that there was a movement--

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,840
(woman 2)
Because we were hearing
what was going on

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,883
all over
the country.

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,718
Yes, yes.

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,178
And it seemed like
it was real everywhere

19
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,679
but here.
What happened?

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,931
How did we get
left behind?

21
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:02,561
(man)
I lived in this part of
North Carolina all my life.

22
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:09,526
Back in 1 970, these fields
were flat-covered in tobacco.

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,570
Far as you could see.

24
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,948
lf tobacco was the blood
of eastern North Carolina,

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,117
then Oxford was its heart.

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,081
For 300 years, tobacco flowed
through those old warehouses.

27
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,375
And like blood,
it kept people alive--

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,794
black and white.

29
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,545
After having served
in Vietnam,

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,965
and having many
black soldiers
around me,

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,427
where it was
pretty much the norm,

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,306
I come back home
and only find a
few blacks

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,225
on the Highway Patrol
at the time,

34
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,976
it seemed
a little
strange to me.

35
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,437
But being
an old North Carolina boy

36
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,732
and raised down in New Bern,

37
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,069
um, I was surprised,
but at the same time,

38
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,781
my background told me
that I wasn't too surprised.

39
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,950
Martin Luther King
was never my favorite,

40
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,326
but I admired him.

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,411
I liked what he stood for.

42
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,455
But after Dickie Marrow
was killed,

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,624
nobody was having
that shit anymore.

44
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,294
We was about ready
to kick some ass
our own selves.

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,952
(little boy)
What is it?

46
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,203
(older boy)
Shh.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,297
See? I told you
Grandma Jessie's rich.

48
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,257
Wow.

49
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,302
There's gotta be close to
$10 worth of Cokes
right here.

50
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,803
I'm gonna take one.

51
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,805
She won't miss it.

52
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,515
(man)
Vern, Tim,
come on outside

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,892
and say goodbye
to your grandmother.

54
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,643
(grandmother)
Vernon.

55
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,853
Saying our goodbyes,
Mother Jessie.

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,855
Vernon, before you go,

57
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,024
there's something serious
l've got to talk
to you about.

58
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,692
lf my boys
broke something, you
know I'm good for it.

59
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,860
Bye, Grandma.

60
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,195
So long, Grandma!

61
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,989
I n the car!
Okay, last one.

62
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,116
Well, I think
we're ready.

63
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,661
Martha, I asked Vidalia
to pack a basket of food
for the trip.

64
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,872
Would you go see
if it's ready?

65
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,999
Of course.

66
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,667
[door closes]

67
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,836
Anyway, Vernon,

68
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,423
I know you believe
you can talk your way
out of every predicament,

69
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,176
but Oxford
is not like Biscoe.

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,262
They're more
set in their ways.

71
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,972
Don't you worry,
Mother Jessie.

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,641
The Lord hasn't
let us down yet.

73
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,608
It's not the Lord
I'm worried about, Vernon.

74
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,861
Let's get this show
on the road, Tysons.

75
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,279
Load 'em up.

76
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,782
Oh, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

77
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,492
You be sure
and write me, you hear?

78
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,868
I will. I'm gonna
miss it here, too.

79
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,954
All right, sweetie. Bye.

80
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,748
Bye, Mother Jessie.

81
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,083
(both boys)
Bye, Grandma.

82
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,834
Vernon, you take
care now.

83
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,670
(Vern)
I don't want to leave.

84
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,880
(Tim)
Me, neither.

85
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,590
(Vernon)
Come on, everyone.
We're on an adventure.

86
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,401
[bell rings]

87
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,152
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

88
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,946
I said good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,656
(class)
Good morning.

90
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,741
Welcome to
third period English.

91
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,411
My name is Mr. Chavis.

92
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,040
And I'm your teacher.

93
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,959
lf you could, turn
with me to page 1 5
in your textbooks.

94
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,420
We'll be covering
Ralph Ellison.

95
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,048
Mr. Chavis.

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,009
Yes.

97
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,677
you really know
Stokely Carmichael
the Black Panther?

98
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,179
Yes. I know him.

99
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,933
When I was at U NCC, I had him
speak to a student assembly.

100
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,685
And they let
you do that?

101
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,354
Sure. I was head
of the Student Union.

102
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,607
And I thought it would be
a good idea if people heard
what he had to say.

103
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,609
What's a
Student Union?

104
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,619
What's a Student Union?

105
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,498
A Student Union is basically
an organization of students,

106
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:39,004
a place to meet,
discuss ideas,
affect change.

107
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,465
Any other questions
before we start?

108
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,634
Yeah. Why'd you ever want
to come back to Oxford?

109
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,906
Are you sure you priced
this flour right?

110
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,534
I can get it over at the A&P
for almost 50 cents less.

111
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,871
Then you just walk
another mile and a half
over there and buy it.

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,751
May I have a bag, please?

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,360
(Tim)
Why do we have a house
with furniture already in it?

114
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,028
(Martha)
Because the church
owns it, honey.

115
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,406
It's not ours.

116
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,741
Remember the one
where all the furniture
was covered in plastic?

117
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,537
(Vernon)
Hah. That was a long
time ago, little buck.

118
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,581
Oh, Vernon,
it's beautiful.

119
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,877
I just hope they haven't
completely redecorated
the place.

120
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,256
Just once, l'd like
to paint our home myself.

121
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,385
Okay, everyone,
best behavior.

122
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,429
Let's go, Tysons.

123
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,901
Reverend Tyson ! Hi.

124
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,611
You must be Martha.

125
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,071
Yes, hi.

126
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,531
I'm lsabel Taylor,
and on behalf

127
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,575
of the ladies
of First Methodist,

128
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,077
welcome to Oxford
and your new home.

129
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,954
We knew y'all would
be getting in late,

130
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,081
so we just
dropped off
a few things

131
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,417
so you'd have
something for supper.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,420
Well, thank you.
Everything looks
so nice.

133
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,590
We painted
the whole house
and redid the drapes.

134
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,925
You shouldn't have.

135
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,302
Well, I don't
mean to be rude,

136
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,679
but I need to
excuse myself.

137
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,474
But you ladies,
you feel free to
stay and just visit

138
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,683
for as long
as you like.

139
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,477
See you Sunday.

140
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,438
(woman)
Sure you don't need
any help unpacking?

141
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,275
No, thanks,
I'm fine. Bye.

142
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,653
Oh, Lord, not again.

143
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,211
[sighs]

144
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,380
[knocking]

145
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,756
Come in.

146
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,592
(Roseanna)
Mrs. Tyson?

147
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,010
Yes?

148
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,388
Hi. My name is
Roseanna Allen.

149
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,766
I'm a friend of Vidalia,
who works for your mother.

150
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,061
She said you might be
needing some help.

151
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,188
Roseanna, you
are a godsend.

152
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,368
(woman)
Ben, is that you?

153
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,620
Yeah, it's me, Mom.

154
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,792
Oh, good.
Dinner's ready.

155
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,127
(mom)
And all you could see
were these little feet

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,545
running down the hall,
just bare bottomed,

157
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,631
and him chasing him.
It was so--

158
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,965
(woman)
You were
chasing my baby?

159
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,343
I was trying
to catch him.

160
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,887
I was trying to--
And you know, you would be
surprised how quick he is.

161
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,640
He was just
mad because they
broke the vase.

162
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,684
Do you know how long
we've had that, though?

163
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,893
I gave you
the money for--

164
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,228
Oh, come
on, that--

165
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,854
Quit crying
about the vase.

166
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,527
So did you see Mary
Catherine Chavis
at school?

167
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,986
Mm-hmm.

168
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,656
She still there?
She was tough.

169
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,158
I still don't understand
why you didn't take
that offer

170
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,952
to start on
your doctorate
right away.

171
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,037
You know, you
are always
better off

172
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,831
just getting into it
and getting it
over with.

173
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,750
I don't know. Those kids

Well, actually,
I was thinking

176
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,841
about doing something
else with my time.

00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,176
Really? What's that?

Why?

181

Well, I think
there's a need.

A need for whom?

find out.

I want to
thank all of you

243
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,087

my wife Martha

244
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,756

Boo, and Julie,
with such open arms

247
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,221

so welcome this week.

00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,600
Now, let us pray.

Father,

250
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,940
we live in difficult times
that challenge our faith

251
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,777
in new and often
difficult circumstance.

252
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,614
Grant us the power
to choose right
from wrong,

253
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,659
and the strength
to love all people

254
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,537
of all races,
because in the
eyes of God,

255
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,455
we are all equal.

256
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,291
ln Your holy name
we pray. Amen.

257
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,045

[knock on door]

00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,887
Mrs. Alwin,
I'm Reverend Tyson.

260
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,307
I heard you
on the radio.

261
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,060
You have a
beautiful voice.

262
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,229
Well, thank you, ma'am.

263
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,483
'Course, I don't usually
trust preachers with
beautiful voices.

264
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,738
They tend to
think too highly
of themselves.

265
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:17,577
But then I
heard your sermon
about the Negroes,

266
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,663
and I changed my mind.

267
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,832
I thought this
is either a man

268
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,544
with a
total disregard
for his career,

269
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:31,674
or else he's one of the
bravest preachers
I ever heard.

270
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,386
Either way, he wasn't
all full of himself.

271
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,847
(Vernon)
Well, I'm not sure

272
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,933
my wife would completely
agree with you on that.

273
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,227
(chuckles)
She must be
a good woman.

274
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,730
She is.

00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,190

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,402
Good.

278
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,534
You know, Reverend,
l've been a member
of that church

279
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,954
for 87 years,
and l've seen

280
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,375
20, 22 pastors
stand in that pulpit,

281
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,296
some good, some
not so good.

282
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,218
But they all fell
into two groups.

283
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,387
They were either priests,
or they were prophets.

284
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:26,187
The priests told us
the comforting things
we wanted to hear.

285
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,275
The prophets
challenged us

286
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,321
with the
difficult things
we needed to hear.

287
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,581

are you?

I try to be
a little bit
of both.

289
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,130
Oh, Reverend,

290
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,759
in these times,
I think you're going
to find it very hard

291
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,387
to be both.

347
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,760
and if you
keep that temper of
yours under control,

348
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,096
you might
just end up
a rich man.

349
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,765
Don't you worry
about me, Billy.

350
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,143
I'm gonna be fine.

351
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,271
(male voice)
Next order of business,
a request by Mike Taylor

352
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,440
for a new stop sign
down his way.

353
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,317
Neil, is
the application
in order?

354
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,319
Yes. We've
been out there
and checked it out.

355
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,030
Then I'm looking
for a motion to
move this thing along.

356
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,198
Motion.
Second.

357
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,283
All in favor?

358
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,617
(many)
Aye.

359
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,453
Opposed? Motion carried.

360
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,997
Next item.

361
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,125
Restoration of
the basketball
rims in city park.

362
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,626
Mr. Chavis, this
is your request?

363
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,170
It is, Your Honor.

364
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,964
Looks pretty
straightforward to me.

365
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,508
Um...

366
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,552
unfortunately, Mr. Chavis,
we are not

367
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,597
the jurisdictional body
you need to be addressing.

368
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,016
That would be the town
Recreational Committee,

369
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,143
which meets the first
Tuesday of every month.

370
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,062
I have, Your Honor.

371
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,980
I beg your pardon?

372
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,815
I have
submitted that request
to the Rec Committee,

373
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,233
but since it never holds
a quorum in its meetings,

374
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,651
it can't vote
on that request.

375
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,903
Well, better
luck next month.

376
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,821
Mr. Mayor,

377
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,990
the Rec Committee has
not held a quorum
since 1964,

378
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,992
which, not coincidentally,

379
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,869
was the year
of the Federal
Civil Rights Act.

380
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,662
But, that may be,

381
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,831
but there's nothing
that we can do
about that.

382
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,249
Actually, there is,
Your Honor.

383
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,710
Based on the town charter,

384
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,337
if a standing committee
is without a quorum

385
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,381
for a period of longer
than six months,

386
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,176
then it's possible
for this council--
to call for a vote.

387
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,178
Neil?

388
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,347
He is correct,
Your Honor.

389
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,266
But only if there is
a quorum present

390
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,102
at the time
the vote is called.

391
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,734
[clears throat]

392
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,699
Your Honor
and everybody,

393
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,702
I'm sorry, but I forgot
I need to leave
early tonight.

394
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,461
I'm afraid I have
to leave early as
well, Your Honor.

395
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,926
Well, that leaves us
without a quorum.

396
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,513
Adjourned.

397
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,530
How'd it go?

398
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,078
What was that
Frederick Douglass quote

399
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,081
your father was always
so fond of reciting?

400
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,625
Power concedes nothing...

401
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,253
Without a demand.

402
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,755
Yeah, well,
I demanded.

403
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,341
The power
just rolled
right over me.

404
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,969
Well, I don't think
Frederick Douglass

405
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,765
expected the
power to yield
on his first attempt.

406
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,976
[chuckles]

407
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,353
I guess he didn't.

408
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,355
Get some rest, son.

409
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,690
Night, Momma.

410
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,541
Pack of menthol
Rx, please.

411
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,836
What you trying
to pull, boy?

412
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,632
They're--for
my momma, sir.

413
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,135
Yeah?

414
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,471
Then she ought to know
that they're 35 cents.

415
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,148
Why'd you tell him
these were for
your momma?

416
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,069
For 35 cents, he'd
sell the baby Jesus
a pack of smokes.

417
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,990
He's got, like,
500 other--

418
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:35,950
(Jebbie)
That was awesome.

419
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,076
Sweet, man.

420
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,994
What the heck?

421
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,830
Hey, what're you
niggers doing in
our neighborhood?

422
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,707
What're you doing?

423
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,173
Y'all better get
your black asses
out of here

424
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,218
before we
come over there
and kick them out!

425
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,976
(several)
Run!

426
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,609
(Roseanna)
Hey!

427
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,111
You get home. Now.

428
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,574
[sigh]

429
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,119
Thank you, Roseanna.

430
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,413
He was gonna
kill me!

431
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,040
And why
would that be?

432
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,793
Well, because Jebbie
threw a rock at him.

433
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,464
I didn't throw it!

434
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,841
Well, it didn't look like
you did much to stop him.

435
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,138
You go clean up.

436
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,766
And get
them cigarettes
out your back pocket

437
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,769
before your momma
gets home.

438
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,440
Thanks, Roseanna.

439
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,941
Good night.

440
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,318
(Vernon)
See you tomorrow.

441
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,212
What're you
gonna do?

442
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,757
I'm taking you on
a trip, little buck.

443
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,055
(Daddy)
Whoo!

444
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,099
Come on! Let's go!

445
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,564
Come on, Daddy!

446
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,899
Are you
speaking to me?

447
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,150
Yeah!

448
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,904
Woo-hoo!

449
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,308
Daddy?

450
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,479
When are you
gonna talk to me?

451
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,859
I'm not, little buck.

452
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,319
I'm gonna
show you something.

453
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,165
What is it, Daddy?

454
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,753
It's a revival!

455
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,588
Tim.

456
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,132
Tim. It's
not a revival.

457
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,964
(man's voice)
The light of Jesus.

458
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,298
(several)
For our God.

459
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,802
The light of Jesus.

460
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,805
(several)
The light of Christ.

461
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,223
The light of Jesus.

462
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,141
Deliverance.

463
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,645
We are the chosen ones.

464
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,773
By the fire of
Calvary's cross

465
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,067
and the sentinel
and the bearer of
the light,

466
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,736
jointly give birth
to the star.

467
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,864
For our God.
For our God.

468
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,242
Let the
circles of light
become alive.

469
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,663
The light of Christ.

470
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,666
We mean to cleanse
and purify
our virtues

471
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,046
by burning out our
vices from the fire
of His word.

472
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,923
The light of Christ.

473
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,384
Honor,

474
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:32,848
truth, loyalty, purity.

475
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,017
For our God.
For our God.

476
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,936
[cheering]

477
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,940
I want to go, Daddy.

478
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,984
Shh.

479
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,527
(faint)
Please, Daddy.
I want to go home now.

480
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,863
Let the circle
truly become

481
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,866
a living representation
of our order

482
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,036
in the darkness
of the world.

483
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,179
When I saw the cross,
I thought everything
was good.

484
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,892
Evil can sometimes be
hard to recognize.

485
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,227
It hides in
normal things.

486
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,438
People you
think you know.

487
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,069
But recognizing evil
isn't the hardest part.

488
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,112
It's standing
up to it,

489
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,031
even when nobody
else will.

490
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,914
(Dr. Proctor)
So essentially, the
quality of our choices

491
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,416
determine the quality
of our lives.

492
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,461
Which, translated, means
you probably need to work
a little harder.

493
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,759
[whispering]
Thank you.

494
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,098
Dr. Proctor, my name is
Reverend Vernon Tyson.

495
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,474
Reverend Tyson.

496
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,518
Please.

497
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,105
I'm the pastor
at the Oxford
Methodist Church.

498
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,940
I heard you
preach last year

499
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,441
at the North Carolina
Council of Churches.

500
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,694
You gave a
magnificent speech.

501
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,989
Well, thank you,
Reverend Tyson.

502
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:17,452
But I'm assuming that
wasn't the only reason
you came to see me.

503
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,287
So he said yes.

504
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,790
And we'll get run out
of town together.
[chuckles]

505
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,375
You might be
right about that.

506
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,293
Well, I think
you're overreacting.

507
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,462
I'm just
saying there are
people in this town

508
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,007
who think that things
have moved awfully fast
in a very short time

509
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,551
and maybe
they should just--
slow down a bit.

510
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,886
Well, if anybody
bothered to ask the
blacks in this town,

511
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,181
they'd tell you if things
went any slower they'd
be going backward.

512
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,019
At the very least
don't you think you
should've consulted

513
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,813
with the Executive Committee
before inviting him to speak?

514
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,858
Dr. Samuel Proctor
is one of the leading
educators in America.

515
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,568
All the
more embarrassing
if you have to go back

516
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,319
and tell
him they won't
let him preach.

517
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,822
They? Who is they?

518
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,326
You know
full well
who's they.

519
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,079
They, who
put bread
on our table.

520
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,625
[sigh]

521
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,252
I know what I'm
doing, Martha.

522
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,257
Trust me.

523
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:19,681
Just promise you'll give
me 24 hours notice to
start packing.

524
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,933
Bless this food
to the nourishment
of our bodies.

525
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,685
[phone ringing]

526
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,687
May Your goodness
and mercy be upon us

527
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,355
and with those
less fortunate.

528
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,524
I n Your
holy name. Amen.

529
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,776
(others)
Amen.

530
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,527
No. I got it.

531
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,077
Reverend Tyson.

532
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,953
Oh, hello, John.

533
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,622
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we just sat down--

534
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:48,043
Yeah, sure, l'd
be happy to listen.

535
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,212
I see.

536
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,799
Un-huh.

537
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,051
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

538
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,096
but I'm afraid
I can't do that.

539
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,974
No.

540
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,814
[phone ringing]

541
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,821
Reverend Tyson.

542
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,489
(male voice)
Is it true you invited

543
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,284
a nigger to preach
at our church?

544
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,161
Who is this?

545
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,247
'Cause if it's true,
you're gonna regret it.

546
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,748
Who is this?

547
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,125
[dial tone]

548
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,010
[sigh]

549
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:46,935
(kids, shouting)
Fight! Fight!

550
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,895
Stop it! Stop it!

551
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,606
Tim Tyson!

552
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,483
What are you doing?

553
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,154
He called Daddy
a nigger-lover.

554
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,990
Your daddy
doesn't need
you to defend him.

555
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,618
I wasn't defending
him, Momma.

556
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,495
I was trying
not to be wicked.

557
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,664
Wicked?

558
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,876
Daddy says
the wickedest
thing we can do

559
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,212
is to do nothing.

560
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:19,050
[sigh]
Oh, honey.

561
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,677
[ding]

562
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,305
Dorothy.

563
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,806
I came as soon
as I heard.

564
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,976
How's Joe?

565
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,477
He's gonna be okay.

566
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,271
Thank God.

567
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,818
Vernon...

568
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,282
he isn't
gonna want to see
you when he comes out.

569
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,095
(Martha)
Vernon? ls that you?

570
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,849
Vernon?

571
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,855
Dick called.

572
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,193
They scheduled
an executive committee
meeting tonight at 7:00.

573
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,866
What was I
thinking, Martha?

574
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,245
Did I really
believe I could change
everything by myself?

575
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,920
You're not changing
anything--by yourself.

576
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,466
I'm here.

577
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,096
Stand your ground.

578
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,392
Good evening, everyone.

579
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,726
Reverend Tyson.

580
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,979
Jack, Mr. Pink.

581
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:54,813
Vernon.

582
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,232
Dick.

583
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,484
I'm assuming we're
all here tonight

584
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,404
because of my invitation
to Dr. Samuel Proctor
to speak this Sunday.

585
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,489
Why would you
do this, Vernon?

586
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,658
I got people coming
into my store asking me

587
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,618
what kind of ship
we're running here.

588
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,620
Wanting to know did
we really invite

589
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,664
a Negro preacher
to stand in
our pulpit?

590
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,249
And what did you
tell them, Jack?

591
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,334
I told them
they heard wrong.

592
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,045
Ain't no Negro professor
speaking in our church
on Sunday.

593
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,465
Oh, Jack, why in the hell
would you say something
like that?

594
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,634
'Cause it's the
truth, Thad!

595
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,804
Vernon, nobody's saying
that it's perfect here,

596
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,308
but we've got good relations
with the Negro community.

597
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,769
This might not be time
to--to stir things up.

598
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,105
What time is
a good time, Dick?

599
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,774
A year from now?

600
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,985
What, five years
from now, Doug?

601
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,654
Does that sound about right?
Once your boys graduate
high school?

602
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,450
Ten years from now? Heck,
this is starting to sound
like work.

603
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,038
Why don't we just
leave it for the next
generation to fix?

604
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,664
lf this man
speaks on Sunday,

605
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,458
there will
be a breach

606
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,626
that will split
this congregation.

607
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,881
Is he worth tearing
this church apart over?

608
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,389
You, um, you can end
this with one
call, Vernon.

609
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,934
Just call him
and tell him
don't come.

610
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,484
We're living beneath
a dam, gentlemen,

611
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,154
a dam that's holding back
300 years of wrong.

612
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,323
Now, you can say that dam
ain't going to break

613
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,158
all you want,
but when the rains come

614
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,494
and that dam bursts open

615
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,496
and all that's bad
comes flooding out,

616
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,083
you won't have time
to run for high ground.

617
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,002
Now is the time.

618
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,090
That's why
I invited him.

619
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,842
And that's why I'm not
making that phone call.

620
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,677
Well, that's all
well and good, Vernon,

621
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,429
but this is
our church,

622
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,182
and you don't have
a right to do this.

623
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,935
Well, actually,
Jack, I do. And
you gave it to me.

624
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,687
This is the Methodist
Book of Discipline.

625
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,357
It defines the
rules that govern
our denomination.

626
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,359
And it says--

627
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,611
"the pastor
of this church
can determine the number

628
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,614
and the nature of services
held in the sanctuary."

629
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:15,036
And for the moment,
I am still the pastor
of this church.

630
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,456
Now, if you see
things differently,

631
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,544
you give Bishop
Grayson Tullis
a phone call

632
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,337
and you let him know.

633
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,966
Otherwise, I have a job
to do tomorrow, gentlemen.

634
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,677
And I hope to see
you all there.

635
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,348
[organ playing]

636
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,451
Reverend Tyson?

637
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,328
You never asked me what I
was going to speak about.

638
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,456
No, sir.

639
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,251
I didn't think
that was my place.

640
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,752
Thank you.

641
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,802
Shall we face
the lions?

642
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,096
[chuckles]

643
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,329
I come to you today

644
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:43,291
to talk about a problem
of enormous magnitude.

645
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,628
Something some of you would
probably rather not hear about.

646
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,840
But it is a subject
that affects us.

647
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,468
I am the president
of North Carolina A&T,

648
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,345
a black university
of approximately 4,000--

649
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,971
I'll be right back.

650
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,640
outstanding young men
and women.

651
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,642
Among our many fine
accomplishments

652
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,393
is our football program.

653
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,313
The other day,
my coach came in
to see me.

654
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,732
He told me
that the finest
running back

655
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,568
he had ever seen
is down at New Bern.

656
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:15,323
Now, this prospect's daddy
and his brother both went
to A&T.

657
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,367
But when my coach went
down to recruit him,

658
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,994
he say he ain't
coming to A&T.

659
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,580
Said he's going to school
over at Chapel Hill,

660
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,874
says he's going to play
for the Tarheels.

661
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,044
They got the big school
over there, big money,

662
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,839
the big stadium, and he's
going to play for them.

663
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,050
Then my poor coach
drove over to Kinston

664
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,011
to see about this 300-pound
offensive tackle they got

665
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,347
at the Negro
high school there.

666
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,015
A fine young man,
good grades,

667
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,102
but he say he ain't
coming to A&T, either.

668
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,688
That his mama wants him
to play for N .C. State

669
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,400
and wear the red and white
of the Wolfpack.

670
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,111
Well, when Coach finished,
he looked at me defeated,

671
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,572
and said, "I'm sorry,
but we're going to struggle

672
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,031
"next year
on the football field

673
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,035
and probably
for years to come."

674
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,497
l've never seen
a sadder man.

675
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,044
I walked over
and put an arm
around him and said,

676
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,880
"See, that's the problem
with all this integration,

677
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:17,218
Coach, that's just the price
we're going to have to pay."

678
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,138
[laughter]

679
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,564
Our lesson today comes
from the Book of John.

680
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,817
Willie Mae? You
listening to
the radio?

681
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:41,451
Willie Mae?

682
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,577
(little girl, happily)
Daddy!

683
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,581
[happy sob]

684
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,761
[loud music,
cheerful whooping]

685
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,679
[chatter]

686
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:21,199
[indistinct chatter]

687
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,202
What'd they feed you
over there, boy?
You're getting big.

688
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,330
Ah ! Cockroaches.
[laughs]

689
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,291
Take this off, handsome.

690
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,126
How are y'all all doing?

691
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,046
You're looking great,
looking great.

692
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,216
That Miss Mary Catherine?

693
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,467
How you doing, son?

694
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,386
Hey, Mr. Yancey.

695
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,804
Thank you
for coming tonight.
I really appreciate it.

696
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,846
You look great.
You look great.

697
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,640
Thank you, sir.

698
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,350
Still growing up like a weed,
but you look great.

699
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,060
Thank you.
See you guys
in a little bit.

700
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,645
See you.

701
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,731
How you doing, man?

702
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,693
Fanny. Hey, baby,
how you doing?

703
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,823
It's good to see you.

704
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,907
Good to see you.
I'll see you
in a little bit.

705
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,158
Hey, Roseanna.

706
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,284
Hey.

707
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,744
You look wonderful.

708
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,829
Auntie Roberta.

709
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,163
Wonderful.

710
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,415
Give me some
of that sugar.

711
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,583
Yes. Yes.

712
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,545
Dickie, we took care
of Willie Mae and the
girls for you.

713
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,921
Just like you
took care of me.

714
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,589
Yes.

715
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,882
Now it's your turn
to take care of them.

716
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,052
I will.
I promise.

717
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,688
Hey, darling.

718
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,691
Betsy, you didn't let him
touch none of this food,
did you?

719
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,069
Well, well, well.
What the cat
dragged in.

720
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,530
How's life at
the rubber plant?

721
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,700
It's good. They're starting
up a late shift next week,

722
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,869
but I ain't
too interested in that.

723
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,121
Well, good. You can
help me down at
the store

724
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,539
in all your
spare time.

725
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,126
[sigh]

726
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,223
Did you put that chain
on that boat trailer
like I told you?

727
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,475
Yeah.

728
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,059
Well, you better have.

729
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,811
You let something
like that slip

730
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,022
and you go back
and that boat
won't be there.

731
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,775
The chain's there. Boat'll
be there when we get back.

732
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,818
Like that time
you left the
bolt undone

733
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,654
on the back door and
they stole us blind
down at the shop.

734
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,906
That was
an accident.

735
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,240
Took care of that.

736
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,658
Yeah, when it
was too late.

737
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,410
You need to use
your head, son.

738
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,787
Yes, sir.

739
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,830
Betsy went to
the doctor today.

740
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,916
The baby's doing fine.
Everything looks okay.

741
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,668
Maybe once that baby
comes, y'all'll come
by more often.

742
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,922
You ready to
be a granddaddy?

743
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,424
Hmpf.

744
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,593
You ready to be
an uncle, boy?

745
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,470
I don't even like
being a brother.

746
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,430
[laughs]

747
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:53,142
Go on back upstairs
and start packing
your bags, then.

748
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,353
All right, you
see Mr. Fox here?

749
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,814
Mr. Fox needs some sleep, too,
just like you need some sleep.

750
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,649
All right? All right.
So get to bed.

751
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,943
I'll see you
in the morning.
All right?

752
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:14,622
[tired sigh]

753
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,958
Why don't you
go find Boo

754
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,378
and play
a couple hands
of bid whist.

755
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,464
I know you've been
wanting to catch up.

756
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,009
I'll be okay.

757
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,845
I'll be back
in a bit.

758
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,055
I'll be waiting.

759
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,893
Go on.

760
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,357
(Fanny)
Who's there?

761
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,693
It's Dickie, Fanny.
How you feeling?

762
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,444
Oh, I'm hanging
in there.

763
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,572
lf you're
looking for Boo,
he ain't here.

764
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,074
Think he's
at Four Corners.

765
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,826
lf you're
going over there,

766
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,494
will you get me
a ice-cold soda?

767
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,745
I sure am thirsty.

768
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,664
You got it.

769
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,332
And don't
go getting
in no trouble.

770
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,500
Bring my soda
right back here
to me.

771
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,836
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,060
Okay. I took out
the trash and broke
down those boxes.

773
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,562
Anything else?

774
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:25,067
Yeah. Go lock up
the barber shop.

775
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,861
How much longer
we gonna be here?

776
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,113
Well, till the old man
turns the lights out.

777
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,119
[whistles]
He closing up?

778
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,456
I'll bet you that's
the last time Roger
comes over for dinner.

779
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:48,424
Hey, Dickie.
Is that you?

780
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,968
Yes, ma'am,
Mrs. Downing.

781
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,396
Seen Boo?

782
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,397
No, man.

783
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,607
Nowhere.

784
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,858
All right.

785
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,367
Hey, girls.

786
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,243
Y'all looking
good tonight.

787
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:19,789
Is this where all
the action is?

788
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:26,754
I can't believe y'all
out here all by
y'allselves.

789
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,255
Hey, nigger!
Hey, you!

790
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,633
That's my wife
you're talking to.

791
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,260
Hey, man, listen, I
was just talking to
the sisters here.

792
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,179
Right.

793
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,973
Hey, man, it's cool.
Listen, listen.

794
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,432
I was just talking
to the sisters over here.

795
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,809
The hell you were.

796
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,603
Man, what're
you doing?

797
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,188
I'll show you
what I'm doing.

798
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,356
[grunts]

799
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,525
(wife)
Larry, no!

800
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,360
Hey!

801
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,529
Larry, no!

802
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,322
[grunts]

803
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,282
Stop it!
Larry, stop!

804
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,742
[wife]
Stop!

805
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,910
Damn!

806
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,537
You're crazy, man!

807
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,621
[wife]
He's got
a knife!

808
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,752
Hey, Dickie!
Dickie, run!

809
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,216
Hey, where's the fire?

810
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,467
[shotgun blasts echo]

811
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,846
[Boo shouts, moaning]

812
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,976
[panting]

813
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,936
I didn't do nothing!

814
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,254
Okay, okay, man.

815
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,674
You got me.

816
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:58,345
Let's just
forget about it.
You got me, man.

817
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,847
Okay?

818
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,359
[grunts]

819
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,532
[grunting,
fists pounding]

820
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:29,210
[grunts and pounding]

821
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,379
[grunts and thuds]

822
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:37,259
Better stop that
before you kill him!

823
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,345
You better get back
in your house, woman!

824
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,471
[grunts]

825
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:45,726
[continued kicking]

826
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,272
[heavy breathing]

827
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,235
[gunshot]

828
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,238
[dog barking in distance]

829
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,493
[train whistling in distance]

830
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,045
Go lock up the stores.

831
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,694
[sobbing wildly]
Oh, God.

832
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,445
Oh, God, Dickie.

833
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,781
Ba-bro, get us a car.
Go get us a car!

834
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,825
Honey, we got to find him.

835
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,869
Oh, dear. Okay,
you look over here.

836
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,328
(nurse)
Ma'am, stop.
You can't go in there.

837
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,914
Over here.

838
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,958
Dickie? Dickie,
it's Roberta.

839
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,334
I'm right
here, honey.

840
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,294
Ma'am, you'll
have to leave.

841
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,797
Oh, my God!

842
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,674
What have they
done to you?

843
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,385
They're going to have to
take him to Duke Hospital.

844
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:08,767
[ambulance siren wailing]

845
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,716
No. No!

846
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,509
I ain't going to no
damn police station.

847
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,844
They ain't gonna listen
to a word I got to say.

848
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,055
Boo, I'll take you down.

849
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,191
Ain't nobody gonna
mess with us.

850
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,235
Who's on the desk?

851
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,861
Let me speak with him.

852
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,578
Dale.

853
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,206
Yeah, this is
Billy Watkins.

854
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,458
I understand there was
a shooting tonight

855
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:19,129
at, um,
Mr. Teel's store
out at Four Corners.

856
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,259
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

857
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,219
He's with me.

858
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,764
I'll bring him in
a little later.

859
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,808
'Preciate it.

860
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,399
Do you still
have people
up in Berea?

861
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,443
Yeah.

862
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,028
Call 'em. Tell them
you're gonna
be staying

863
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,614
with 'em
for a while.

864
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,246
Well, what you
want me to do?

865
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,248
Go upstairs.

866
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,583
Get yourself
a pillowcase.

867
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,794
Fill it with all
the money you can
put your hands on.

868
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,338
You're gonna need it.

869
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,261
Excuse me, Sergeant.

870
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,680
This is
William Chavis.

871
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,808
He was
shot this evening
by Mr. Robert Teel.

872
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,936
Mr. Teel and his sons
killed Dickie Marrow.

873
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,105
It was witnessed
by Mr. Chavis

874
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,441
and he'd
like to report
that murder,

875
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,444
his own assault,
and swear out a warrant
for the Teels' arrest.

876
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,531
Have a seat.

877
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,305
Sorry.

878
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:02,483
[sigh]

879
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:19,083
All that time
he was in the service,

880
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,753
I prayed that nothing
would happen to him.

881
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,255
I prayed and prayed.

882
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,594
Somebody should've told me
I needed to be praying

883
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:35,099
he wouldn't get shot
in his own hometown.

884
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,549
Nothing I can do.

885
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,267
C'mon, Boo.
Let's go home.

886
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,114
John, I just heard.

887
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,908
What can I do?

888
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:22,247
It's too
late, Vernon.
Too late.

889
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,333
Go on home.

890
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,510
Oh, nice one.

891
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,677
So close.

892
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,137
Hey, where you been?

893
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,181
Home. Y'all hear?

894
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,475
Daddy, Roger, and them
shot them a nigger.

895
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,435
Why?

896
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,647
Said something
he shouldn't have
to Larry's wife Judy.

897
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,650
Tim Tyson.

898
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,984
Come in for supper.

899
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,070
What're we having?

900
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,072
I am not
announcing my menu
to the neighborhood.

901
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,782
Come in now.

902
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,553
[rumble of thunder]

903
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,225
Shh. It's only me.

904
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,229
Daddy.

905
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,192
Is everything
going to be okay?

906
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,319
Go to sleep,
little buck.

907
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,607
[indistinct shout]

908
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,609
Y'all, come on.

909
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,367
[shouting]

910
01:00:29,751 --> 01:01:31,603
[shouting continues]

911
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,816
Let's go around back.

912
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,700
[siren approaches]

913
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,550
[shouting and noise fade]

914
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,226
(mayor)
Quiet, please.

915
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,437
This morning,
I dispatched a telegram
to the Governor's office

916
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,440
informing him
of the events
of last night,

917
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,402
as well as my intention
to declare the existence
of a state of emergency

918
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,405
and the imposing
of a curfew for
all citizens

919
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,409
from 7:30 in the evening
until 6 in the morning,
beginning tonight.

920
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:14,247
Further, I requested
from him the assistance
of State Troopers

921
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,166
to help enforce this curfew.

922
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,836
And most importantly,
to restore a safe, secure,

923
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,590
and law-abiding
environment for the
hearing tomorrow

924
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,968
and for the trial
in the months to come.

925
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,351
All citizens my ass!

926
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,811
Damn right.

927
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,395
That curfew
ain't nothing

928
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,814
but a No Niggers
After Nightfall Act.

929
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,564
(several)
That's right.

930
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,404
(teacher)
You can have...

931
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,200
whatever you can take.

932
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,701
(student)
Yeah.

933
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,953
That's right.

934
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,790
Yeah, Mr. Chavis.

935
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,459
But you can only keep--

936
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,711
what you can--

937
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,675
hold.

938
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,301
That's right.
We're gonna keep it!

939
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,761
Keep what, Darrel?

940
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,973
Beer? Cigarettes?
TV sets?

941
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,933
You think that's why
the State Troopers
are here?

942
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,602
Because you broke
some windows and
stole some groceries?

943
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,312
They're not.

944
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,356
You want to know
why they're here?

945
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,483
They're here
because last night,
when you hit those streets,

946
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,652
you took something
more valuable than you
could ever imagine.

947
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,321
Something our families have
been fighting for for years.

948
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,158
I'm talking about equality.

949
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,828
And they're not going to let
you keep it without a fight.

950
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,580
I ain't giving
it back.

951
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,831
Me, neither.

952
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,291
Good.

953
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,547
Mr. Chavis!

954
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,382
Mr. Chavis,
where you going?

955
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,011
What's going on?

956
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,556
Come on!
