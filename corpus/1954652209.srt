00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,401
<i>So as this journey comes to an end
and you begin your next,</i>

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:10,481
<i>Know that you were meant
for greatness and for good.</i>

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,989
<i>It won't be easy,
and certainly not quick;</i>

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,923
<i>it may take you
your entire life to fulfill</i>

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,929
<i>what it is that
you are meant to do.</i>

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,795
<i>But every step
will put you closer.</i>

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,665
<i>Every experience will
prepare you for the next.</i>

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:31,107
<i>Every failure will lead you
to your success.</i>

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,303
<i>You will be tested
in ways you can't imagine.</i>

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>But I have confidence
that you will prevail,</i>

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,115
<i>that you will see
your dreams come to fruition,</i>

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,415
<i>and that you
will leave your mark,</i>

13
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,823
<i>your legacy on this world.</i>

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,488
<i>Congratulations
to the class of 2012,</i>

15
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,122
<i>the generation
of world-changers.</i>

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,329
<i>This is how college goes.</i>

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,997
<i>Freshmen year, you're
psyched to be away from home</i>

18
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,268
<i>and independent
for the first time.</i>

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,641
<i>Sophomore year,
you figure it's your second year</i>

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,776
<i>so you better
settle on a major.</i>

21
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,081
<i>Or not.</i>

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,656
<i>Junior year,
eye on the prize.</i>

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,060
<i>Your dreams
start to take shape.</i>

24
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,325
Maybe you even
meet somebody.

25
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,165
<i>Senior year,
you can't wait to graduate</i>

26
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,107
<i>because you're ready to go
out there and change the world.</i>

27
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,146
<i>Or, at least
go on to grad school.</i>

28
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,847
<i>And that's how college goes.</i>

<i>Unless you're me.</i>

31
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,919
Stop it, lots of people
take 5 years.

32
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,422
Smile.

33
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,936
Nice.

34
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,437
Ooh, hey guys, come on.

35
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,439
Dad, Catherine and Ryder
need to be in the picture.

36
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,442
All hail her highness,
the Valedictorian.

37
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,847
<i>I'm here to merely serve.</i>

38
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,515
Ah, good one.

39
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,798
Ooh, really?

40
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,138
Hey, congratulations
all of you.

41
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,511
Glad all of you made it.

42
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,777
Miracles still
happen, I see.

43
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,119
Professor,
any words of wisdom for us

44
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,917
on this auspicious occasion?

45
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,958
God has a purpose
for all of you.

46
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,927
Some of you see it clearly,
some of you don't yet.

47
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:41,590
But just go out there
and seek him.

48
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,167
<i>You'll find it.</i>

49
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,792
Hop up there, professor.

50
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,136
<i>One more picture, come on.</i>

51
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,638
One more, that's it.

52
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,207
<i>Smile everybody!</i>

53
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,707
<i>It was our time.</i>

54
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,176
<i>The whole world
was ahead of us.</i>

55
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,214
At that moment,
we never would have believed

56
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,681
<i>that one of us wouldn't
make it through the year.</i>

57
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,913
Okay, you two have been
married for months now.

58
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,677
Isn't it time you stopped
staring at each other?

59
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,479
Not a chance.

60
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,485
Hey, at least you
don't have to live with 'em.

61
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,078
Yeah, that's
gotta be awkward.

62
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,159
Listen, you all
will be as happy someday.

63
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,658
And Ethan could
have his own girlfriend

64
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,252
if he wasn't so Ethanish.

65
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,163
<i>Did you
break up with Holly?</i>

66
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,665
It's true.

67
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,702
<i>Oh, why?
She was great.</i>

68
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,670
Nah, I saw this, like,
clingy look in her eye.

69
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,139
What does that
even look like?

70
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,369
Kind of like this...

71
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,241
Stop it,
that's so creepy.

72
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,747
Cut it out.

73
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,078
Okay, why did
you call us all here?

74
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,675
I wanna buy
the next round of lattes

75
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:13,815
because I am the new social
media coordinator for Mogul.

76
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,324
<i>I start next week.</i>

77
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,952
Congrats, man.
That's perfect for you.

78
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,156
<i>It's not as high up
the ladder as Miss Catherine,</i>

79
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,631
most esteemed
investment manager.

80
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,258
You've got to
start somewhere, my boy.

81
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,303
- I agree.
- Keep at it, you'll make it.

82
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,633
I thought you were gonna take
that cool non-profit job

83
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,709
where they give away shoes
every time someone buys a pair.

84
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,800
It didn't come
with a company car, so-

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,311
You got a car?

86
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,903
I just thought there
was further to go

87
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,414
with an investment company.

88
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,915
You know, with
more ladder to climb.

89
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,417
Nice.

90
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,918
Besides, somebody has
to make a difference

91
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,420
in the corporate world.

92
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,989
<i>Fifteen minutes, Ethan.</i>

93
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,024
So Alé, are you gonna tell them
your good news, as well?

94
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,791
- Are you pregnant?
- No, no, no.

95
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,230
Actually, Alé and I have
been offered positions

96
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,700
with Embrace a Village.

97
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,270
What's that?

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,705
It's an organization that serves
leprosy colonies in India.

99
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,833
I am sorry,
did you just say "India"?

100
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,707
Did you just say
"leprosy"?

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,802
I mean, I didn't even know
that still existed.

102
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,313
Is that safe?

103
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,850
Oh yeah, it's totally
curable and preventable,

104
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,477
as long as you have
the right medicines on-hand.

105
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,283
The problem is,
most people don't get the help

106
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,153
that they need because of
the shame that's associated

107
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,317
<i>with the disease.</i>

108
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,951
People with leprosy
and their whole families

109
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,189
are just cast out
of society.

110
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,288
Yeah, the organization
works hard to catch it early

111
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,799
<i>and to keep up with
the medical needs,</i>

112
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,132
<i>but also to help them
experience a spiritual healing.</i>

113
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,207
We're gonna be working
with children in a home setting.

114
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,768
You guys look
absolutely inspired.

115
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,710
Yeah, we feel like
this is the call

116
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,646
that God's been placing
on our lives for years.

117
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,581
It makes sense now.

118
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,849
I mean, intercultural
communications grads

119
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,049
with hearts for God.

120
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,626
Congrats, guys.

121
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,490
When do you-
When do you go?

122
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,688
- Oh, 3 weeks.
- Three weeks.

123
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,265
Three weeks?!

124
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,071
So Ryder, it looks like
I'm gonna need a new roomie.

125
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,436
Well, my attempts
to spare Catherine

126
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,702
the despair of singlehood
have failed, so-

127
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,209
Though,
I appreciate your pity.

128
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,710
Absolutely, man.

129
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,975
Cool, 'cause there is no way
I'm moving back in with my dad.

130
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,986
Ethan, let's go.

131
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,589
I'll get the lattes, yeah?

132
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,954
<i>Be good.</i>

133
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,488
<i>Catherine, it's Ryder.</i>

134
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,999
You free for lunch?

135
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,899
You could see my office.

136
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:43,269
I have an amazing
view of a hallway.

137
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,001
And there is this Thai
restaurant rig ht around-

138
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,805
<i>I'm sorry, I can't today, Ry.</i>

139
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,435
I'm just--
I'm so busy.

140
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,174
It's my first presentation
with the big wigs, you know?

141
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,443
I'm sure your
office is great.

142
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,746
-It's cool.
-Can I call you back later?

143
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,322
- I'll catch you later.
- Okay, alright, bye.

144
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,947
Okay.

145
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,150
<i>If you want good Thai,
I can show you a better place.</i>

146
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,923
Yeah.

147
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,998
Yeah, I'm new around here.

148
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,498
I'm Whitney.

149
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,297
I work in IT, and the director
asked me to loop in with you

150
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,803
about all these tech updates
you're proposing.

151
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,304
I'm Ryder.

152
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,706
Oh, well, you've got
a lot of ideas, Ryder.

153
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,744
That's why they hired me.

154
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,370
Mogul's been a little slow
about adopting social media,

155
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,416
or media at all really,
so you should just know

156
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,646
the upper ranks are
a little old-school.

157
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,779
That's why they hired me.

158
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,029
- Hey Catherine.
- Hey Margo.

159
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,193
Hey, I was wondering,
have you guys ever had

160
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,601
any problems
with clients here?

161
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,674
Like, anybody freaking out or
showing up angry or anything?

162
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,573
Oh, you mean that
Investment West thing?

163
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,077
Yeah, somebody
just told me about that.

164
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,274
Oh, well, you never know what
people are capable of doing.

165
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,907
Oh, and I'm so sorry,
Catherine.

166
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,418
Mr. Rowley has rewritten
some of your report,

167
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,512
and he just wants me
to pass out the new ones.

168
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,386
Oh, um...
Oh, okay.

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,323
Well, do you know
what changes he made?

170
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,725
I mean, should I take a look
at these before I present?

171
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,697
I don't like to say
anything bad about anybody.

172
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,961
Oh Catherine, you are a
very sweet girl, and religious,

173
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,798
and I think you should
just stop worrying about

174
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,667
your crazy clients.

175
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,263
I think you ought
to start worrying about-

176
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,864
<i>Good, you
got the new reports.</i>

177
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,035
Let's get these
old ones off the table.

178
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,945
Catherine, Catherine,
you'll sit over there.

179
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,176
Not at the table?
What about my presentation?

180
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,683
I'll handle it.

181
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,550
<i>You just observe
and don't say anything.</i>

182
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,782
But sir, I have some
really good ideas as to how-

183
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,382
No, no you don't.
You don't have any ideas.

184
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,984
Don't say a word.

185
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,427
Are we clear?

186
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,762
Where do you want me to take that?

187
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,838
Donate it.
We don't need it anymore.

188
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,337
Just take it.

189
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,408
Oh, and there's
my new roomie now.

190
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,774
Hey, everybody.

191
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:05,839
Okay, so the flowery teacups,
those are gonna go away, right?

192
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,349
Because I'm gonna
need some room

193
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,718
for my collector's edition
Star Wars drinkware.

194
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,222
Those were Mom's.

195
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,815
We'll wait 'til she moves out
before we move in the pool table

196
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,326
and the cool neon signs.

197
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,192
- Nice, stay classy, guys.
-What does that mean?

198
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,300
<i>Oh hey.</i>

199
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,097
Taking the investment world
by storm yet?

200
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,139
Not quite yet.

201
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,209
<i>Well, I have secured
a very large cubicle</i>

202
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,801
and charmed the IT department,
all in one day.

203
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,744
- I bet you have.
-I have.

204
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,247
What is this?

205
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,408
Oh, we have
to show you guys this.

206
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,749
This is from Joe and Pat, the
founders of Embrace a Village.

207
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,652
Oooh.

208
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,656
How cool is this, look.

209
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,158
Wow.

210
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,626
<i>That's pretty.</i>

211
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,492
Dude, is that a dress?

212
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,997
No, it's a kurta.

213
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,567
- Kurta.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,661
Ooh, and look at this.
Oh, you're gonna love this.

215
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,600
<i>It's a bedspread!</i>

216
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,372
It's a curtain.

217
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,380
No, it's a sari.

218
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,643
And you wear it like this...

219
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,719
<i>Kind of beautiful.</i>

220
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,913
I know it'll be
just the guys here,

221
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,958
but that just--
that doesn't look rig ht.

222
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,891
Let's get to the send-off before 1 get emotional.

223
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,394
What send-off?

224
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,486
Oh, Dad's got a cool
surprise for you two.

225
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,261
We're not dressed
for anything.

226
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,461
<i>Oh, sari...</i>

227
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,939
I thought that
was kind of bad.

228
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:37,395
<i>Alright son, are
you ready for this?</i>

229
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,672
<i>Alright son, are
you ready for this?</i>

230
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,176
Been born ready.

231
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,339
Literally popped out with
a passport in my hand.

232
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,610
I am so proud of you.

233
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,583
Take good care
of my little girl, alright?

234
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,312
You know I will.

235
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,322
Hi.

236
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:58,760
Every body, could we gather
around Luke and Alé, please?

237
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,963
<i>We love you both
so much.</i>

238
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,474
And we're gonna
miss you terribly.

239
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,103
I mean, I still
can't believe that-

240
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,581
Sorry.

241
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,050
Ethan,
do you wanna take over?

242
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,552
<i>Sorry.</i>

243
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,748
Well, Ryder's got the big mouth.
He should make the speech.

244
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,825
Go Ryder.
Get up there.

245
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,262
Luke and Alé!

246
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:42,398
We send you off with our love,
support, and our prayers.

247
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,906
<i>You know,
not a for of people</i>

248
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,407
have the guts
or the determination

249
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,502
to follow God into hard
places, but you guys--

250
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,606
I mean, you dreamt it
and now you're gonna live it.

251
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,083
This is your time.

252
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,788
To Luke and Alé!

253
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,191
<i>Alright, Professor Callahan,</i>

254
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,352
you prayed us through
a lot during college.

255
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,895
How 'bout
one more time?

256
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,396
Okay.

257
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,466
Thanks for coming.
Good to see ya.

258
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,795
<i>Put
your hands on these kids.</i>

259
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,104
<i>They're headed
for quite an adventure.</i>

260
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,944
<i>Father God, we ask that you
take the willing hearts</i>

261
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,348
<i>of your children,
Luke and Alé Taylor,</i>

262
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,854
<i>and use them for
your purposes in India.</i>

263
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,016
<i>May they be a blessing
to all around them.</i>

264
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,152
<i>May your light shine
through their lives.</i>

265
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,560
<i>May people
in bondage and dismay</i>

266
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,830
<i>find hope and life in you
because of their work.</i>

267
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,931
Protect them.

268
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,304
<i>Provide for them.</i>

269
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:55,607
<i>And bring them back to us
safely in your time.</i>

270
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,204
<i>Amen. Amen.</i>

271
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,946
Luke, please, come.

272
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,186
Our hearts are full.

273
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,752
Thank you guys so much.

274
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,993
Man, we're gonna miss you.

275
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,762
<i>But we're confident
that God is gonna do</i>

276
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,633
<i>as much in your
life here at home</i>

277
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,469
as he will through ours.

278
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,978
Ry, you're gonna use
that big mouth for good.

279
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,914
<i>It's gonna echo around the world
and change lives.</i>

280
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:38,580
And Catherine, you're gonna be
a leader in your workplace,

281
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,557
<i>where many are gonna
follow your example.</i>

282
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,186
And Ethan, there are
great things ahead for you,

283
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,392
<i>and if not graduate school
then something else</i>

284
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,867
bigger and better.

285
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,134
Alé, you wanna come up?

286
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:09,477
All of you,
just really gonna miss you guys.

287
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,853
<i>But we're just an e-mail
or a very expensive</i>

288
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,860
international
cell phone call away, so.

289
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,089
It's pricey.

290
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,133
You know, we love you.

291
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,667
Thank you.

292
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,371
Alright,
enough of this crying.

293
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,875
Come on.
It's time for some karaoke.

294
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,570
That's where
I say goodnight.

295
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,772
No, I have so much
packing to do.

296
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,283
No, no, no, come on.

297
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,875
Luke, this is our
last time together.

298
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,216
Get up here on this mic.
Right now.

299
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,890
<i>Wel, Luke and Alé are
off on some huge adventure</i>

300
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,985
<i>across the globe,
and here we are cleaning up.</i>

301
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,859
What's wrong
with this picture?

302
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,455
Better find
a mate quick, man.

303
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,727
All the good ones
are dropping like flies.

304
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,268
I'm sorry, did you
just equate dating

305
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,065
with dropping dead
like a fly?

306
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,538
- Yes, I did.
- Isn't that how you see it?

307
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,074
No, no, I just-

308
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,871
No, I don't have
time for that right now.

309
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,468
I've gotta get back
to the office tonight

310
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,444
to submit some numbers.

311
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,710
Alright, well, guess I'll have
to turn to desperation then.

312
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,513
- Story of your life.
-Yeah, what's new?

313
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,019
Status update:

314
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,749
"Anybody got anything
worthwhile going on tonight?"

315
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,985
Wow, that is desperate.

316
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,789
No, no, the saddest pan
is that my mom,

317
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,295
she'll be the
first to respond.

318
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,796
This is true.

319
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,799
Oh! There she is!
Right on cue.

320
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,030
Hello?
Hey Whitney.

321
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,969
Not much.

322
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,201
Yeah, yeah,
I think I can fit that in.

323
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,835
Hey, sounds great.
I'll see you in an hour.

324
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,413
Oooh.

325
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,277
I'm sorry,
what just happened here?

326
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,009
Girl from work
called me.

327
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,881
Is she stalking you
on Facebook?

328
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,681
She's following my Twitter,
thank you very much.

329
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,017
Yeah, she's following
a twit alright.

330
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,786
Hey man,
you don't mind, do you?

331
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,292
Please, you weren't
helping out anyway.

332
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,886
Get out of here.
Go see Whitney.

333
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,987
Hey dude,
I'll see you at the house.

334
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,498
Ah. yes!

335
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,000
Hey, drive safe, okay?

336
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,967
Don't make Alé
worry about you.

337
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,470
Really?

338
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,471
What, she said that
he has one foot in heaven

339
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,973
because of his driving.

340
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,543
Uh-huh.

341
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,536
So, you know anything
about this Whitney girl?

342
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,616
No.

343
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,999
You worried
about them at all?

344
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,659
No, they're just
young and in love

345
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,135
and everything's perfect
for 'em right now

346
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,137
<i>Just wonder what it
would be like if the world</i>

347
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,639
came crashing in
on them, that's all.

348
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,472
Yeah, well, they're gonna get
a big ol' dose of real world

349
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,045
coming here in a few days.

350
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,273
Yeah.

351
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,375
No protecting
my little sister anymore.

352
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,511
I have to go
finish my reports.

353
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,954
- Please, get out of here.
- Thank you.

355
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:05,893
Hey, find out
about Whitney?

356
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,464
Aye-aye, Captain.

357
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,958
Get out of here.

358
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,797
See you later.

359
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,326
You okay?

360
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,592
Yeah, of course.

361
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,759
It's not lost on me
that everybody's off

362
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,962
on their own adventure
while you-

363
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,266
Get left behind?

364
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,571
I know it's not
what you planned.

365
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,737
Yeah, well.

366
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,712
Maybe Dad was right about
the whole English degree,

367
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,047
you know what I mean?
It is pretty useless.

368
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,246
He's not rig ht.

369
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,688
And those
grad school people...

370
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,659
Well, they don't
know you like I do.

371
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,626
Otherwise you'd be in.

372
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,356
Yeah.

373
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,265
Maybe I was meant to
make sandwiches, you know?

374
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,859
Although, it would've
been nice to know that

375
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,770
before racking up
5 years of student loans.

376
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:29,107
Ethan, God made you
for this time and place.

377
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,842
He has something really
important for you to do.

378
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,216
No, he has something
important for you to do.

379
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,654
So go do it.

380
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,160
Don't send me any
support letters either, okay?

381
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,099
'Cause that's
all I'm giving you.

382
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,762
No, this-

383
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,366
This is your entire
grad school savings.

384
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,706
I don't need it anymore.

385
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,245
No, you might.

386
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,977
And I-l can't accept
this much money.

387
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,314
Well, you're not
taking all of it.

388
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,719
I kept some of it back
sol can come visit you

389
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,222
in a couple months.

390
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,792
Oh!

391
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,063
Promise?

392
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,235
Okay.

393
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,773
I love you.

394
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,543
I love you, too.

395
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,416
Hey, take care
of Dad for me.

396
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,611
Do I have to?

397
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,452
- Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,684
Got the bags, got the tickets,
flight's on time.

399
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,259
You ready, Mrs. Taylor?

400
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,161
I'm ready.

401
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,662
<i>Alright, let's do this.</i>

402
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,925
- Let's go.
- Okay.

403
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,707
<i>- This is</i>-

404
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,240
<i>First you spend
your life dreaming about</i>

405
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,402
<i>how great things
are gonna be one day,</i>

406
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,243
<i>then that one day
finally arrives</i>

407
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,978
<i>and it's thrilling and scary</i>

408
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:20,284
<i>and it's everything and nothing
like you thought it would be.</i>

409
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,953
<i>And you thank God for the
amazing new things he's doing,</i>

410
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:30,864
<i>a new adventure, and the way
he put all the pieces in place.</i>

411
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,028
<i>And you pray that you'll
really be able to handle it</i>

412
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,800
<i>like you thought you could.</i>

413
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,009
<i>There's no shortage
of work at Embrace a Village.</i>

414
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,987
Now you're a part of a team
that serves 35 leprosy colonies

415
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,524
by assisting
with medical needs,

416
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,652
making shoes,
serving in pantry,

417
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,196
and working
with the children.

418
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,324
And that's what we're
gonna be doing mostly, right?

419
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,460
There are 300 children
in our after-school program

420
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,372
and 41 living in
our Little Lights Home.

421
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,341
- That's a lot of kids.
- Yeah.

422
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,844
Yeah, we are in desperate need
of more facility for them,

423
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,744
but we are making do.

424
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,908
Put us to work.

425
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,849
Yeah, first,
we welcome.

426
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,184
Our children want to
greet you in a special way.

427
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,781
I think they are ready.
Just come.

428
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,359
Okay.

429
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,921
Oh, that was great!

430
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,718
Oh, thank you!

431
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,794
Oh, they're so precious.

432
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,762
Rose, do the
children have leprosy?

433
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,163
No, these are the children
with their family members

434
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,068
<i>who have a disease,
but they are healthy.</i>

435
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,901
You want to make
some quick friends?

436
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,474
Of course.

437
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,308
How long did you have to do that
before you gain their trust?

438
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,441
Two years.

439
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,818
And one day I got invitation
from 40 leprosy village leaders.

440
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,017
<i>I shared with them my vision
and my dreams with them</i>

441
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,790
for the medical facility,
education for the villages,

442
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,957
<i>and food for the people,
you know?</i>

443
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,197
I tell them I did not have
funds to do all these things,

444
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,241
but I could feel that they
did not have trust in me.

445
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,741
I'm really worried.

446
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,813
And then Tibrek,
one of the leprosy patients,

447
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,144
asked me if I'd like tea
and I said yes.

448
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:37,482
<i>And he, with his wounded hand,
washed his cup of tea</i>

449
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,217
and served me
the same cup.

450
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,758
<i>Everybody in the room
was silenced</i>

451
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:47,922
<i>and wants to see whether
I drink that tea or not,</i>

452
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,126
but I don't have fear about it
because a little act of love

453
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,465
<i>and I really want
to change their life.</i>

454
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,802
<i>I really want to make
difference in their life.</i>

455
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,375
I had the tea

456
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,412
and five leader welcomed me in their village, you know?

457
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,108
You willingly
exposed yourself?

458
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,276
Yeah, see,
for the little act of love

459
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,048
I got five villages' fund.

460
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,852
That's really great.

461
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,560
Professor, how's it going?

462
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,365
Ethan, I'm good.

463
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,998
Just catching up on
some new required reading.

464
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,202
Ah, looks like
a Ryder book.

465
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,178
Oh, we're going to require
all our business majors

466
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,045
to start taking some
Communications courses.

467
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,744
There's so much
integration now.

468
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,447
Anyway, what are you
writing these days?

469
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,650
Oh, I'm not actually.

470
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,353
I'm mostly making
sandwiches, so--

471
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,930
Can you take a minute?

472
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,330
Uh, sure.

473
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,601
How's your sister doing?

474
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,300
Uh, she's good.

475
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,309
Yeah, she doesn't get
much of a chance to e-mail,

476
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,176
but when she does
it sounds great, so-

477
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,510
And you?
What happened to grad school?

478
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,984
I didn't get in.

479
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,679
<i>I got wait-listed
for Boston,</i>

480
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,951
<i>but there's probably like
50 people on that list, so...</i>

481
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,654
semester already started
so that's out.

482
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,697
<i>Luke and Alé are off to India
changing it for good,</i>

483
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,859
<i>Ryder's got a great job
and a new girlfriend,</i>

484
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,200
and Catherine's
already got a company car.

485
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:39,833
And I've got an apron, so.

486
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:45,540
And an apron doesn't
compare to a company car.

487
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,346
Well, it does come with
the perk of being reminded

488
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,150
of my failure
everyday by my father.

489
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,849
What failure?

490
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,448
You've got a job.

491
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,256
That can be hard to come by
in this economy.

492
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,561
You've also got time
to figure some things out.

493
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,965
<i>Are you listening
for God's voice,</i>

494
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,128
<i>asking what
he has for you?</i>

495
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,799
Yeah, I mean,
I'm trying to stay close.

496
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,242
<i>You know, I look for signs,
but there are none.</i>

497
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,404
It's just silent.

498
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:21,211
You know, it's like
everybody else is in the game

499
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,651
and I'm just
sitting on the bench.

500
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,950
I mean, am I not
good enough for God to use?

501
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,322
How do you know
he's not using you?

502
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:34,056
<i>I get that you feel
like you're on the bench</i>

503
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,063
while your friends
are in the game,

504
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:40,603
but if that's
where God has you

505
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,764
then you just sit
on the bench in obedience.

506
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:48,743
<i>I promise, somehow,
what you're doing</i>

507
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,747
<i>will work into what
he has for you in the future.</i>

508
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,452
Makes sense in my head,

509
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,283
just doesn't makes sense
in my heart, you know?

510
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,948
Trust in God's timing.

511
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,426
Until then,
all you can be is-

512
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,465
Obedient.

513
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,033
Thanks professor.

514
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,931
Anytime.

515
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:18,269
My door, or table,
is wide open to you, Ethan.

516
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,139
Well, I'll be here.

517
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,873
Oh, there's one of my world-changers now.

518
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,384
Probably get to it.

519
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,454
- You take care, Ethan.
-You too, professor.

520
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,352
See ya.

521
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,195
Hey you.

522
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,796
You okay?

523
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,526
No. This dream job is
turning into a nightmare.

524
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,034
What?

525
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,899
This whole
Investment West shooting...

526
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,234
It has me feeling like
every decision I make

527
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,069
is life and death.

528
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,574
Where's Ryder?

529
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,076
Uh, he's on his way.

530
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,873
I got a cool video
to show you guys.

531
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,675
Is it gonna make me
feel better or worse?

532
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,909
Uh, worse.

533
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,213
Awesome.

534
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,083
Hey everybody,
meet Whitney.

535
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,122
This is Ethan and Catherine.

536
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,714
I've heard so much
about both of you.

537
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,815
You're so nice,
letting me crash the party.

538
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,986
Nice to meet you.

539
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,086
Um, I'm just
gonna go to the--

540
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,029
Oh yeah, it's
right in the back there.

541
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,601
Okay, cool, thanks.

542
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,792
Hmm?

543
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,997
You know, Ryder, I think
Ethan was joking when he said

544
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,267
that you needed to find
a mate as quick as possible.

545
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,468
Is she the
first one you saw?

546
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,135
- She's cute man.
- Right?

547
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,214
Hey, you don't mind me
bringing her, do you?

548
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,713
<i>Are you guys,
like, officially dating?</i>

549
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,215
Yeah.

550
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,807
Um, yeah.
I think so.

551
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,614
Has she experienced
your driving yet?

552
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,620
Cate, can't you just
let him be happy for once?

553
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,884
Um, yes.
I totally am.

554
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,960
Rig ht.
You're jealous.

555
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:50,293
So Ethan, Ryder tells me
that your sister is in India.

556
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,799
It's so amazing.

557
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,767
I really admire
people like that.

558
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,428
Yeah, she's
really great actually.

559
00:29:55,527 --> 00:30:00,499
Um, her only problem is that
she wants to adopt all the kids.

560
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,100
Here, let me show
you guys this video.

561
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,941
- Oh, right.
- Oh, yay.

562
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,037
<i>Oh, I wanna see.</i>

563
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,885
Yup, okay.

564
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,846
Hi, you guys!

565
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,982
Hi, we miss you terribly.

566
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,685
Oh, Cate, thank you
for the necklaces.

567
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,193
They love them.

568
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,161
You know, Luke's
actually off right now

569
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,731
at one of the villages
with Anil,

570
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,098
and I am, as you can see,
hanging out with the kids.

571
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,602
Say "hi," kids.

572
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,935
Hi, Aunties and Uncles.

573
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,440
So cute.

574
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,532
Hi, Aunties and Uncles.

575
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,043
This is Raj.

576
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,808
He is one of our
miracle children, literally.

577
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,009
They found him tied to a tree
when he was 3 years old

578
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:45,680
but he is thriving
here and so are we.

579
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,519
It really is starting
to feel like home,

580
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,024
except that you guys
aren't here.

581
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,619
We miss you and we'll see
you at Christmas, okay?

582
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,198
- Bye!
- Bye!

583
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,767
Bye!

584
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,559
- They look happy, huh?
- She looks so good.

585
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,138
That's great.

586
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,538
I'm sorry,
are you crying?

587
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,705
It's just-that was
just really beautiful,

588
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,214
I mean, don't you think?

589
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,306
<i>Just the little boy
and the tree.</i>

590
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,817
I mean, we're just
working with computers,

591
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,321
but they're saving
kids' lives.

592
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,822
Yeah, I need to go.

593
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,620
Oh, I thought you
had to tell us about

594
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,319
your good/bad day
at the office.

595
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,521
Nope, uh-oh.
Nope, yuck.

596
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,099
- What?
- Um, the--

597
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,168
Oh, Holly's here.

598
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,971
Who's Holly?

599
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,840
It's his ex.

600
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,170
Yeah, he broke up
with her.

601
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,003
Come on, lonely guy,
go talk to her.

602
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,843
No, I'm pretty
sure she hates me.

603
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,507
Oh, who would hate you?

604
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,017
Um, she could, yeah.

605
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,519
You should go
talk to her.

606
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,316
Yeah, I mean, somebody
has to take her order.

607
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,822
Yeah Ethan,
go take her order.

608
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,089
Take that order, milkshake,
two straws, two straws.

609
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,860
If this goes horrible,
you guys...

610
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,433
Uh-oh.

611
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,698
But I have to
go back to work.

612
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,794
Hey Holly.

613
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,373
Hey.

614
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,936
- Do you wanna--
-Yeah, definitely.

615
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,012
Check this out.

616
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,406
<i>"Oh Holly, how
could I have ever been so blind?</i>

617
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,383
I should have
never let you go."

618
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,683
<i>"I know,
because I'm so beautiful and wonderful</i>

619
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:32,785
and muy caliente and-
And you just can't handle that."

620
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,990
<i>"Oh,
but I've changed I'm ready.</i>

621
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,761
Won't you drop dead
like a fly with me?"

622
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,235
<i>"Only if
you can handle my clingy eyes."</i>

623
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,737
"Oh, but I can.

624
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,534
I can handle
your clingy eyes."

625
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,267
And your static cling, too.

626
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,677
Oh...

627
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,940
So?

628
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,348
What did she say?

629
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,977
She wants me to call her.

630
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,817
When?

631
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,720
Never.

632
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,759
Yeah, she said that
she thought I was someone

633
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,293
who is going places,

634
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:09,331
but turns out I'm just a loser
who works in a sandwich shop.

635
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,831
That's not true.

636
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,663
That's not awkward,
is it?

637
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,135
It's a really cute shop.

638
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,637
Thanks.

639
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,139
Okay, I'm gonna go.

640
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,041
Uh, alright.
See you later.

641
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,635
What's with her?

642
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,511
Oh, she just had a bad day
at the office, you know?

643
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,811
Oh, we all have them.

644
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:32,116
Don't we?
Ain't that the truth?

645
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,121
Hey, can we
get two lattes?

646
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,623
Just, I mean-

647
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,886
I'm sorry,
I'm not your waiter.

648
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,814
- Hey.
- Hey.

649
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,415
- You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

650
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,085
Yeah.

651
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,858
I'm just-
I'm just tired.

652
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,433
Yeah.

653
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:25,397
Did you see that
older man that came in?

654
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,102
I mean, he's gonna
lose both of his legs.

655
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,907
The infection's
just so bad.

656
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,572
I wish we could've
caught him earlier,

657
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,616
but you just sit
this one out, okay,

658
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,117
if it's too much?

659
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,984
No, no, no. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

660
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,688
You know what?

661
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,195
Let's go.

662
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,697
Let's take a break.

663
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,767
Just for
a few days, okay?

664
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,063
We could explore Chennai.

665
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,764
No, honey, come on,
that's so sweet,

666
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,863
but we just-
we have too much to do.

667
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,374
There's no way.

668
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,172
No, I think it'll be good.
It'll be fun.

669
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,677
I'll talk to Anil about it

670
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,443
and we can go see
Marina Beach,

671
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:11,645
St. Thomas Mount, yeah?

672
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:16,419
We could go shopping
in the marketplace.

673
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,222
How did I know shopping
was gonna be a pan of this?

674
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,728
Because I'm a girl.

675
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,229
Yes you are.
Yeah.

676
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,799
So?

677
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,796
Okay, okay, yes.

678
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,893
Thank you.

679
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,539
Hey Elizabeth.

680
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,515
Take Your Grand kid
to Work Day?

681
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,517
No, it's Dad's week to
pick me up from school

682
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,521
but he got held up,
so Grandma came and got me.

683
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,421
Oh, and Mr. Rowley has
some big visitor here

684
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,687
so she's so stressed out.

685
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,787
<i>Oh, are
you super bored here?</i>

686
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,297
Mm-hmm.

687
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,925
Would you like a personal
tour around the office?

688
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,435
Sure.

689
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,005
Can I?

690
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:09,337
Okay, um, what is exciting
here for a 10-year-old?

691
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:12,108
Uh, okay, well,
there's the Senior Accountant

692
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:16,674
and Tax Analyst that way,
which is super boring.

693
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:22,816
We have my
lovely cubicle, huh?

694
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:28,028
Oh, the big cat,
Mr. Rowley's office right there.

695
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,590
And the infamous board room,
where all the big deals go down.

696
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,397
- Sweet.
- Hmm? Shall we?

697
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,569
So, this is where all
the important stuff happens.

698
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:45,341
Big deals that change the world,
hopefully for the better.

699
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,282
Okay, alright, so, there's a
huge deal on the table, okay?

700
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,546
But the board needs
you to convince them.

701
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,349
What are you gonna do?
Go, do it.

702
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:57,415
Okay, um, my fellow board
members, I implore you--

703
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,119
Ooh, ooh,
big word, nice.

704
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,720
I implore you to
commit to this merger--

705
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,230
Oh, that's Mr. Rowley.

706
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,028
I don't want my grandma
to get in trouble.

707
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,602
Okay, just go, go, go, go.

708
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,037
So tell me, what did you
find out about the Sonji deal?

709
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,077
It would be
extremely lucrative,

710
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,739
<i>but we gotta work our way
around the bank Secrecy Act.</i>

711
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,314
So you do
suspect laundering?

712
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,446
Alright,
is it worth the risk?

713
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,354
In my opinion, absolutely.

714
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,858
<i>Yeah?</i>

715
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,485
Alright then,
let's move forward,

716
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,360
but keep this information
between the two of us, alright?

717
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,865
Who's working on this?

718
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:41,266
<i>I got a new girl.
She's very green.</i>

719
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,804
She won't catch on.

720
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,305
You sure about that?

721
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,500
I'm sure about that,
come on, let me walk you out.

722
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,577
Don't worry about it.

723
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,651
What were they
talking about?

724
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,722
Um, I don't know.

725
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,221
You know what?

726
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,555
Let's get you back
to your grandma.

727
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,398
Oh, it's Catherine.

728
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,196
Probably some detail
about my party.

729
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,793
You can pick it up;
I don't mind.

730
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,395
I'm good.
You're coming though, right?

731
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,906
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

732
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,409
So all these posts
from the VPs,

733
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,242
you've been writing those
and they're okay with it?

734
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,646
They asked me to make sure
they have a relevant presence

735
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,810
in social media,
so yeah.

736
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,683
I mean, I've set them
each a Twitter account,

737
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,519
but they hardly use them
which pretty much counteracts

738
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,593
the entire task
that they've given me.

739
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,960
Sol post things now and then
on their behalf.

740
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,066
- Here's your file, Ryder.
- Thanks Hannah.

741
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,169
What? I mean,
it's nothing bad.

742
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,741
No scandalous photos
or anything.

743
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,776
Have you talked to
Ed Blair about this?

744
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,276
No, who's he?

745
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,980
Ryder.

746
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,982
<i>Ryder, I need you down here</i>

747
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,485
<i>at the Chief Legal Affairs
office right away.</i>

748
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,054
Of course.

749
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,756
That's Ed Blair.

750
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,195
So you overheard them

751
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,697
say they're gonna ignore
BSA regulations?

752
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,698
Well, it's hard to tell
what the exact plan was,

753
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,291
but whatever it is
I think they're trying

754
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,132
to pin everything on me.

755
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,604
I just-I just don't
wanna be a target.

756
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,333
Well, why don't
you tell someone?

757
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,309
You think this is a little
overdoing it, maybe?

758
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,006
This is gorgeous.
And I can't just tell them.

759
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,208
I mean, mat-I'm gonna say
that, like, I was hiding under

760
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,047
the conference table
and I heard a conspiracy?

761
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,552
I mean, he's already
got everybody believing

762
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,054
that I have
something against him

763
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,215
and there's just so much
bureaucracy in this company.

764
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,224
It's like I can't even
go to anybody higher up

765
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,726
without going
through him first.

766
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,295
Hmm.

767
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,826
What do you want me
to do with this?

768
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,331
I don't know.

769
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,833
You know,
I called Ryder the minute--

770
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,925
The minute it happened
and he never called me back.

771
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,596
The minute
it happened, huh?

772
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,605
Yeah, well hejust--
he always knows what to do.

773
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,198
Oh, he always knows
what to do, huh?

774
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,608
Oh, would you stop?
Cut it out.

775
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,646
What do you want me
to do with your napkins?

776
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,305
Not wrinkle them.

777
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,111
That's definitely not
what I want you to do.

778
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,616
They're paper.

779
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,414
You know,
I bet you that he was just

780
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,216
too busy with Whitney
to call me, you know?

781
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,722
What is your problem
with Whitney anyway?

782
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,223
I don't have a
problem with Whitney.

783
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:17,884
It's, you know-
she just-she's fine.

784
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,588
She just makes
everything different.

785
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,096
Hmm.

786
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,893
I don't know, it just
feels like ever since

787
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,832
Luke and Alé left we've kind of
just all gone our separate ways,

788
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,734
and-I don't know,
it just feels really different.

789
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,306
Maybe for you.

790
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,306
Yeah, well, I think
you have a few good years

791
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,707
left in you yet, so-

792
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,173
Oh, man.

793
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,683
Hey, you're not
supposed to be here.

794
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,844
<i>Hello, we're not done!</i>

795
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,751
We have to cancel the party.

796
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,255
What? What are
you talking about?

797
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,757
<i>I bought your
favorite cake.</i>

798
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,554
Yeah, I seriously made a
massive amount of sandwiches

799
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,788
<i>on my day off.</i>

800
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,064
I got fired.

801
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,428
Awkward.

802
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,033
It looks pretty in here.

803
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,605
Why didn't you
bring Whitney?

804
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:13,011
1 didn't want her to see me looking sad and pathetic.

805
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,584
But it's okay for us to see
you looking sad and pathetic?

806
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,722
You love me
in my low moments.

807
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,157
You two.

808
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,791
Sad and pathetic, right?

809
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,657
Yup, and perfect
for each other.

810
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,530
So if every body
had been here

811
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,090
I was gonna show you this
video as a surprise.

812
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,761
Just don't ask me
to make it go viral.

813
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,305
What is it?

814
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,874
It's from India.

815
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,005
- Oh, yes please.
- Hit play.

816
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,806
<i>Happy birthday, Ryder!</i>

817
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,608
<i>Wish we could be
there with you tonight.</i>

818
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,205
Let me be the
first to tell you

819
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,807
that we are excited for what
God has for you this year, Ry.

820
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,318
Alé and I believe in you.

821
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,820
Oh, and we
miss you so much.

822
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,321
All your goofiness,

823
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,222
and every time I think
about you I smile.

824
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,725
What about me?

825
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,762
Oh, you know
I love you.

826
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,195
Okay, we got a special
birthday surprise for you.

827
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,700
If you can just put
the camera over there.

828
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,202
<i>Ready kids?</i>

829
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,788
Happy birthday!

830
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,521
<i>That was great!
We love you, Ry!</i>

831
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,023
<i>We'll see
you at Christmas.</i>

832
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,525
Say "bye," guys.

833
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,094
Bye!

834
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,288
- Oh, they look good.
- Yeah.

835
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,596
Totally on track
with their dreams.

836
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,396
<i>Remember what Luke
said to me at their send-off?</i>

837
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,065
About my voice being
heard around the world?

838
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,871
Well, that sure got
shut down quick, didn't it?

839
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:53,005
Hey, I can make your voice
heard around the world.

840
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,019
Hmm? What time is it
in Chennai, do you think?

841
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,678
<i>It's like 10 A.M. tomorrow</i>

842
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,188
Perfect.

843
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,588
- Yes!
- Yeah?

844
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,661
What, are you
gonna call them now?

845
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,695
Dude, isn't that, like,
crazy expensive?

846
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,992
Well, I'll pay for it.
Happy birthday.

847
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,498
We need to hear
their voices tonight.

848
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,068
- Thank you.
- Alright.

849
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,568
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

850
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,137
And we're ringing.

851
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:19,304
Hey, Ethan.

852
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,103
Hey, you must be calling
from Ryder's party.

853
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,405
Hey bud, yeah,
we just watched your video.

854
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,039
You know, these two
could use some cheering up.

855
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,548
Big time.

856
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,778
Hey, put that pretty wife
of yours on the phone.

857
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:32,920
Oh, I'll try.

858
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,320
She's shopping, I'll try.
But you know howshe gets.

859
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,392
Hey, Alé.

860
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,731
Hey, hold on a second, guys.

861
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,301
Hey, Alé.

862
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,346
<i>Lu--Luke?</i>

863
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,650
- What just happened?
- Hey, are you there?

864
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,959
Luke, are you there?

865
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,072
Did he find the driver?
Did you find him?

866
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,577
- Not yet.
- Then keep looking!

867
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,079
I could describe
the truck again.

868
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,580
The officer has
interviewed so many people

869
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,582
and all are agreed
that it was an accident.

870
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,175
Alé come out
in front of the car.

871
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,685
No, it was the
driver's fault.

872
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,187
He was going too fast!

873
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,779
He wasn't even looking
where he was going.

874
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,887
What are you saying?
What is he saying?

875
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,896
- Calm down.
- He needs to find that driver.

876
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,558
Finding the driver
won't bring her back!

877
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,495
Dad.

878
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,892
What are you doing here?

879
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,969
<i>I thought you
had some big party.</i>

880
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,940
Dad, um...

881
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,541
What?

882
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:44,845
Alé was hit by a car
in a market in Chennai.

883
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,889
She, um...

884
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,690
<i>She died.</i>

885
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,130
No, she didn't.

886
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:04,195
God is protecting her.
She's doing important things.

887
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,865
She's gonna be fine.

888
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,473
She's gone, Dad.

889
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:37,771
What are they gonna
do with my baby girl?

890
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,570
Luke will
bring her home.

891
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,417
<i>Thank you for coming today,</i>

892
00:46:55,512 --> 00:47:00,325
<i>and for showing such love
to Alexandria and her family.</i>

893
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:04,297
<i>I had the honor
of baptizing her</i>

894
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,595
<i>and watching her grow
here in our church,</i>

895
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,866
leading her in
our campus ministry,

896
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,670
and marrying her and Luke.

897
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:20,010
<i>Alé as always there
to lend a helping hand.</i>

898
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,347
It was her desire
to serve others.

899
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,851
That continued

900
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,513
and led her and Luke to India
where they would show love

901
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:31,923
<i>to others who
had been forgotten.</i>

902
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,325
I believe many of you were
touched by her life and I-

903
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:39,891
I wanted to give an opportunity
to some of you to speak.

904
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:45,064
Luke, son,
would you like to start?

905
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,104
Thank you.

906
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,382
I met Alé sophomore year

907
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:02,685
<i>at a campus fellowship meeting
about upcoming outreaches.</i>

908
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,350
When I saw her I--

909
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:08,794
I couldn't think about
the bar outreach anymore.

910
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,925
I couldn't get over
her presence.

911
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:19,030
She literally glowed
with such love,

912
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:24,101
such a love of Christ.

913
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,643
And...

914
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,350
I can't.

915
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,530
One person that couldn't be
here to say a few things,

916
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:54,837
<i>but sent you
a message by video.</i>

917
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:00,875
<i>I'm Anil and this is
my wife Rose, from Embrace a Village.</i>

918
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,814
We are so sorry
we can't be there today

919
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,615
<i>to say goodbye to Alexandria.</i>

920
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:11,284
<i>She had the most giving heart
of anyone that I've ever met.</i>

921
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,590
<i>When she began work
here, that love,</i>

922
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,326
that spirit-filled presence
grew even more.

923
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:24,703
<i>I wish I had words for what
she meant to the children here.</i>

924
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,641
<i>She was only here
for a short time,</i>

925
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:32,202
<i>but she won't be forgotten.</i>

926
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,839
Our prayers
are with you all.

927
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,279
I love you, Auntie.

928
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,627
Bob.

929
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,005
Thank you all for coming.

930
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:03,874
<i>Alé...</i>

931
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:10,282
Alé was the best daughter her
mom and I could've asked for.

932
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:14,453
She had such a joy about her

933
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,892
<i>and the biggest smile
on Earth.</i>

934
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:27,959
She's the one good thing
I have ever done in my life.

935
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,066
<i>I wanna thank you
again for coming.</i>

936
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,246
What is it about funerals

937
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,187
that make people think you
wanna eat tuna casserole?

938
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:53,227
I mean, I don't even like tuna
casserole when I'm feeling good.

939
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,297
May be we should've
stayed with your dad.

940
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,296
I felt bad
leaving him all alone.

941
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,833
He has plenty of food;
he's fine.

942
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,096
Is this about
what he said?

943
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,194
It's nothing
he hasn't said before.

944
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,865
Well, I thought it
was really beautiful.

945
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,969
I'm sorry, but what
is she doing here?

946
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,480
She doesn't
even know Alé.

947
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,174
- Catherine-
- I'm sorry, she doesn't.

948
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,683
You don't.

949
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,878
<i>And she's sitting there in tears
like she actually knew her,</i>

950
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,683
but maybe Luke needs
his friends to be here

951
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,188
<i>and not some strangers.</i>

952
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,281
<i>I mean, he ran right
off into his bedroom.</i>

953
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,190
Okay, well, that's
not Whitney's fault.

954
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,458
I don't have to stay.

955
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,893
Whitney.

956
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,592
I was just being supportive.

957
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:37,104
I can appreciate someone
that my friends loved, can't I?

958
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,038
But I'll stay
out of your way.

959
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,340
Great.

960
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,972
- Ahem.
- What?

961
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,223
Gone.
You happy now?

962
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,725
I'm sorry, Okay?

963
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,522
<i>Could you two
just stop, please?</i>

964
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,064
I'm just trying to wrap
my mind around this, okay?

965
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,601
I need to understand this.
I just--

966
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,797
1 mean, here 1 am, doing this lame job, right?

967
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,373
Going through the motions.

968
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,305
And then you have
my sister and Luke

969
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:17,038
trying to do something
worthwhile in the world,

970
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,579
<i>and then this happens.</i>

971
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,705
<i>I mean, how cruel is that?</i>

972
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,375
I mean, what is the
lesson in all this?

973
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,248
Stay shallow,
stay self-absorbed,

974
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,753
<i>stay safe,
and you'll be fine?</i>

975
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,754
<i>But no, try to do something
good in the world</i>

976
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,256
and you'll get cut down?

977
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,521
<i>I mean, what kind
of God does this?</i>

978
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,028
<i>I don't know.</i>

979
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,428
I guess you have to go
by what you know of God.

980
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,626
Yeah, which is a lot
less than I thought I did

981
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,134
<i>a few weeks ago.</i>

982
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,635
Why? Do you think
his character's changed?

983
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,728
You think he doesn't
have any power anymore?

984
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,434
You think we didn't
hear his call right?

985
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,442
If we had stayed here
and done some other work,

986
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,240
and if I hadn't dragged
her across the world--

987
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,745
Hey, you didn't
drag her, okay?

988
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,747
If you weren't in the picture
she would've gone anyway.

989
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,943
But I would've have called
to her from across the street.

990
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,145
<i>Okay, then we wouldn't
have called her on the phone.</i>

991
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,949
<i>Right, right, and
if I hadn't gotten fired</i>

992
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,455
<i>I wouldn't have needed
to call her.</i>

993
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,253
<i>How far back do you
wanna take the blame?</i>

994
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,657
There's always one little thing,
but the fact is God took her.

995
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,060
<i>And I'm not ready to think
that it was for no reason.</i>

996
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,654
<i>I'm not ready to
concede to some victory</i>

997
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,961
<i>to some random act
of violence, either.</i>

998
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,660
I have to find
some meaning in this.

999
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,830
There is no meaning.
There's no meaning in it, Ryder.

1000
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,603
If any one of us deserved
to be here, it was her.

1001
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,338
I should've been
in that street.

1002
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,108
She'd still be here.

1003
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,980
You two happy?

1004
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,994
<i>This is how grief goes.</i>

1005
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:50,470
<i>First you try to keep everything
as normal as you can;</i>

1006
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,801
<i>you pretend it didn't happen,</i>

1007
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:57,936
<i>or you pretend that you
can go on as if it didn't.</i>

1008
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:02,642
<i>Maybe you get angry
at the world, at its injustice,</i>

1009
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,811
<i>at anything
or anybody, really.</i>

1010
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,651
<i>And then you're just sad.</i>

1011
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:13,694
<i>Your joy is gone,
your smile fades,</i>

1012
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,889
you see that
person everywhere,

1013
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:20,298
<i>and nothing looks
the same anymore.</i>

1014
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,564
<i>All the things
you believed in are shaken,</i>

1015
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,573
<i>your whole foundation.</i>

1016
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:31,578
<i>Things that were certain,
now come into question.</i>

1017
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,478
<i>And then one day
you finally tell yourself,</i>

1018
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:38,212
<i>"So that happened
and God let it.</i>

1019
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:42,552
<i>"And if he did, then what does
he want me to do about it?</i>

1020
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,718
<i>How am I supposed
to respond?"</i>

1021
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,022
I'm out,
you need anything?

1022
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,961
No, thanks.

1023
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:53,000
What are you working on?

1024
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,194
Resignation letter.

1025
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,034
Um, are you sure
you wanna do that?

1026
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,438
I don't think that's
what Alé would want.

1027
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:06,503
Well, Alé wanted to go to India
and we see how that turned out.

1028
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,076
What's this?

1029
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,814
It's a package
from Rose and Anil.

1030
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,720
Well, aren't
you gonna open it?

1031
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,283
You open it.
I'm done with India.

1032
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,998
Okay.

1033
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,523
Later.

1034
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,279
Here you go, professor.

1035
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,611
Thank you, Ethan.

1036
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,211
Can I interrupt?

1037
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,223
Anytime.

1038
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,259
Thanks.

1039
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,693
How are you holding up?

1040
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,340
Everybody's strong
for Luke, you know?

1041
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,003
A few months ago
everything made sense,

1042
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,877
everybody was ready
to take on the world,

1043
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,951
"This is our time,"
and all that.

1044
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,648
Well, it isn't
"your time" really, is it?

1045
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,782
It's all God's time.

1046
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,587
It's a little hard
to see it that way

1047
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,424
when you look at what's
happened, you know?

1048
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,362
Alé was a special girl.

1049
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:37,166
It was unfair
what happened.

1050
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,933
Yeah.

1051
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:43,603
But it doesn't mean God
isn't still in control.

1052
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,179
That just
doesn't make sense.

1053
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,680
No, it doesn't.

1054
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,478
You look at all
the saints in the Bible,

1055
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,018
in their own times things
didn't make sense at all,

1056
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,610
even though some
of them were following

1057
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,318
the audible voice of God.

1058
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,122
Yeah.

1059
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,289
Out of all of us, Alé's
calling was the clearest.

1060
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:08,858
She knew what God wanted
her to do and she was doing it.

1061
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,735
But that's the
problem with calling.

1062
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:18,575
Too often we think of it as
something we are meant to do,

1063
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:22,912
when really it's something
we're meant to be.

1064
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:28,388
God may have seemingly random
assignments for us to do

1065
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:31,186
all through our lives,

1066
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,851
but they're only
going to make sense

1067
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:37,921
from the person
he's made you to be.

1068
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,096
I think Alé
had that right, too.

1069
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:50,168
Her assignments were
shorter than we expected,

1070
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:58,175
but her hean was right
where God wanted it to be.

1071
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:02,980
So then in this moment when
you're asking a lot of questions

1072
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:06,583
that you'll never
have the answers to,

1073
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:13,658
"Who is God asking me to be?"

1074
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,450
Thanks Ethan.

1075
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,316
You're welcome.

1076
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,013
What's this about,
Ethan?

1077
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,818
We just need Luke.

1078
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,392
Luke?

1079
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:15,654
Is Whitney coming?

1080
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,256
No, she broke up
with me.

1081
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,426
<i>Sorry.</i>

1082
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,026
It's probably
for the best.

1083
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,298
This better not be
an intervention.

1084
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,312
It's not,
but you need to stay.

1085
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,575
<i>Hi.</i>

1086
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,648
You told me to open it
and I did.

1087
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,486
What is that?

1088
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,564
Alé and the children
were working on them.

1089
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,099
She made a special
card for each one.

1090
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,600
<i>Rose sent them
from India;</i>

1091
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,763
she thought we'd still
might like to have them.

1092
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:06,007
Do you know about 'em?

1093
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,241
Yeah.

1094
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,987
<i>Catherine,
this one's for you.</i>

1095
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:27,263
But it has a "B" on it.

1096
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,600
Read the note.

1097
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:35,233
"I had to choose a 'B' for you
because you are so very bold.

1098
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,834
"Catherine,
nothing holds you back

1099
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,675
"and no one sets
a more Godly example

1100
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,306
<i>"in the workplace than you.</i>

1101
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,316
I'm so proud of you."

1102
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,417
She knew everything.

1103
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:55,796
Ryder, you get a "V."

1104
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:02,063
<i>- "Ry, you may not</i>-

1105
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,937
<i>"You're the visionary
of our group, the voice.</i>

1106
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,600
"You're gonna
do great things.

1107
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:12,544
<i>I can't wait to see it and
be a part of it in some way."</i>

1108
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,351
Whose is that?

1109
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:19,886
My dad's.

1110
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,887
It's got a "G" on it
but there's no card,

1111
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:26,120
<i>so I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.</i>

1112
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,424
It looks like
somebody knows.

1113
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,933
There's no note

1114
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,199
'cause she wanted
to surprise him in person.

1115
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:42,299
She wanted to surprise
you all at Christmas.

1116
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,308
"G" is for "Grandpa."

1117
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,210
She was 8 weeks pregnant.

1118
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,456
Why--

1119
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,998
Why didn't you tell us?

1120
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,965
I couldn't tell myself.

1121
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,332
We'd just found out.

1122
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,671
So now you tell me

1123
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,935
<i>how any of that's
pan of God's plan for us.</i>

1124
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:19,980
<i>So if it's God's call,
it's supposed to be easy?</i>

1125
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:25,178
'Cause that's not what
Paul would tell you, or Stephen,

1126
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,811
or Moses, or Jim Elliot
and Nate Saint.

1127
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,551
<i>Do you want me
to keep going?</i>

1128
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:36,654
<i>Because it seems to me the most
obedient ones in the Bible,</i>

1129
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,323
<i>the ones who were
truly following God's call</i>

1130
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,836
<i>on a daily basis,
get thrown in to lions' dens</i>

1131
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:49,171
<i>and fiery furnaces
and shipwrecked and beheaded</i>

1132
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:53,805
and nailed to a cross.

1133
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,213
<i>And they're all praised
for being the most faithful</i>

1134
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,012
and successful
in God's eyes.

1135
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,518
Well, I'm not Jesus.

1136
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,215
No, you're not,

1137
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,815
but this is the call that
all of us have received,

1138
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,692
<i>to be faithful like him,
obedient unto death.</i>

1139
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,527
She wasn't saving them
from their sins.

1140
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,032
Her death has no purpose.

1141
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:17,571
Yeah? Well, I would argue that
you're wrong, on both counts,

1142
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,799
<i>because she
was saving people.</i>

1143
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,069
<i>She was pointing them
to Christ.</i>

1144
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,576
You know what?

1145
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,168
You can't continue
to use your grief

1146
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,373
<i>to keep hiding from the work
that you've known is yours</i>

1147
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,040
for as long
as I've known you.

1148
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,549
That's enough, Ethan.

1149
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,142
No, he needs to hear
the whole truth.

1150
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,652
And what more
might that be?

1151
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:39,489
That what happened to Alé
could've easily happened here

1152
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,960
<i>or anywhere in the States,</i>

1153
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,157
and that it has
nothing to do with India

1154
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,461
or the work you
were sent there to do

1155
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,468
or the person who
called her out on the street

1156
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,302
or the person who
called her 'cause he got fired.

1157
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:58,175
Look, Ethan,
you've crossed the line, okay?

1158
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,874
Well,
that's what brothers do.

1159
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:06,545
<i>Luke, I know it hurts.</i>

1160
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:11,186
It'll always hurt.

1161
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:17,424
She was my sister.

1162
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:22,160
<i>But you can't Jet the hurt
keep you from going out</i>

1163
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,102
and making a difference
in the world.

1164
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,141
<i>You gotta go
back there, man,</i>

1165
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,609
<i>otherwise you
will never be whole,</i>

1166
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,147
<i>you will never be healed,
and you'll never have the life</i>

1167
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:37,878
that you were
meant to have.

1168
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,217
<i>It's what she
would've wanted.</i>

1169
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,790
You said this
wasn't an intervention.

1170
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,231
Somebody
has to go after him.

1171
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,825
No, just give him
a few minutes.

1172
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:05,003
You didn't read
your bracelet, Ethan.

1173
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,317
It has a "C" on it.

1174
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:25,064
Connector.

1175
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:29,102
"Ethan, your writer side makes
you an observer of people,

1176
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:31,672
"but you do more
than observe;

1177
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,105
"you see their hearts,

1178
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,473
"and you're the glue
that holds us all together,

1179
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,706
"our family, our friends.

1180
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:43,079
"Don't let that job
seem unimportant to you.

1181
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,448
Em brace it."

1182
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,890
It doesn't look like
Luke sees it that way, huh?

1183
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,791
Looks like we're all
falling a little short

1184
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:06,135
of Alé's expectations.

1185
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,877
What are we
gonna do about it?

1186
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,307
<i>Well first off!</i>

1187
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:20,410
you two need to realize
that you belong together.

1188
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:21,988
Ethan--

1189
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,357
It's true.

1190
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,190
And second...

1191
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,162
I don't know.

1192
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:37,602
I think I know
who can help us.

1193
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,274
Professor Callahan.

1194
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:43,776
Ryder. what's up?

1195
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,369
Not much. I wanted to talk
to you if you have a second.

1196
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,416
Yeah, how is
everybody since-

1197
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,109
Okay, I guess.

1198
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,448
You know, it just-
it makes you think.

1199
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,715
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about, though.

1200
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,222
Shoot.

1201
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,783
Well, I was fired from Mogul,
you may have heard.

1202
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,796
These executives were
Meeting such ridiculous things,

1203
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,958
just mindless,
pointless garbage,

1204
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:11,334
sol changed some of their
tweets to sound more inspiring,

1205
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,963
more purposeful.

1206
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,008
I take it that didn't
go over very well.

1207
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,508
Yeah, no.

1208
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,603
Legal department was not
pleased, to say the least.

1209
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,080
They had to approve what
the company appears to endorse

1210
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:26,677
or something like that, which is
crazy because I was so careful.

1211
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,690
I mean, I researched each exec,
found out how they were serving

1212
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,420
and using their
influences and--

1213
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,291
And 1 highlighted their causes,
you know?

1214
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,795
I mean, it was amazing.

1215
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,388
You should've seen
how many retweets I got.

1216
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,024
- How many?
-Almost 19,000.

1217
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,399
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1218
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:46,132
I mean, imagine if
those 19,000 retweets

1219
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,208
were all tied
to a purpose,

1220
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:54,213
that there was a call to action
for each and every one of them.

1221
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:57,910
I mean, Alé said that I was
a voice to my generation,

1222
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,715
and I wanna show her
that it was true.

1223
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:04,917
I'm not supposed to be some
cog in a corporate strategy.

1224
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:08,860
I just--I feel like I have an
opportunity to use this medium

1225
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,693
to make a direct difference
for God's kingdom.

1226
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,357
Ryder, I do believe
your world just went

1227
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,164
from black and white
to color.

1228
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,999
How can I help you?

1229
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,630
Well, I have an idea,

1230
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,834
and Ethan said that you
might be able to help me

1231
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,775
take that idea
and turn it into a reality.

1232
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,972
He also said that you've
been working on some strategies

1233
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,346
for social media
and business.

1234
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:35,047
I need a partner.

1235
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,175
<i>Hey Dad.</i>

1236
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,274
Hi son.

1237
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,613
<i>Alé and the children
made you something.</i>

1238
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,281
<i>They made one
for each of us.</i>

1239
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:13,485
It's a-
It's a bracelet.

1240
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:16,085
Seems kind of impractical
for a guy who works with food

1241
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,892
<i>and washes his hands
a hundred times a day,</i>

1242
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,867
but it's
custom-made for you.

1243
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,836
<i>It's got  a "G" on it...</i>

1244
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:34,108
For "Grandpa."

1245
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,784
<i>- I like to think it</i>-

1246
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,755
For "good."

1247
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,258
Alé's not the
only good thing

1248
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,589
<i>you've ever done
in your life, Dad.</i>

1249
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,460
You've served people
with joy for decades,

1250
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:55,627
even though you get very
little thanks or recognition.

1251
01:09:55,724 --> 01:10:01,333
<i>So to me, that "G" could
stand for "generous, " "giving."</i>

1252
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:06,273
I know I've been a
disappointment to you, Dad,

1253
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,847
<i>but I'm not lost.</i>

1254
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,348
I'm not unmotivated.

1255
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,580
I just don't know why
I'm sidelined rig ht now.

1256
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,587
I don't know why
I didn't get into grad school

1257
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,988
or get a better job,

1258
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,787
but maybe it's
because I was meant to be

1259
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:25,093
right here right now,
with you and everybody else,

1260
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:29,101
because if I had been away
at school when this happened-

1261
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,263
I don't know.

1262
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:41,878
Son, you are not
a disappointment to me.

1263
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,953
I just want you to turn out
better than your old man.

1264
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:51,422
I don't want you
washing dishes at 50.

1265
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:55,018
You're better than that.

1266
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:58,929
I want you to be more.

1267
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,468
But if this is the assignment
that God has for me

1268
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,401
then I'm gonna do it.

1269
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,565
With singing,
just like you

1270
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,166
and that's the most
important pan.

1271
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:16,740
If this is what God has for me,
I'm gonna do it, whatever it is.

1272
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,284
Hopefully it includes

1273
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:23,517
giving you that "G" for
"Grandpa" pan one day,

1274
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,388
and who knows what else.

1275
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:29,929
I'm just gonna listen
everyday and obey.

1276
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,993
Oh, son.

1277
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,835
Oh, you're all I've got.

1278
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:48,438
Yeah, sorry about that.

1279
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:53,782
Hey, it's more
than I deserve.

1280
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,789
You're a good man, son.

1281
01:11:56,879 --> 01:12:00,088
And I love you.

1282
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,195
Love you too, Dad.

1283
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,765
Good for me.

1284
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,165
Alright, okay.

1285
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,604
Alright, I wanted to thank
you all for getting involved

1286
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,437
<i>and taking a risk
with this new venture</i>

1287
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,135
<i>Callahan and I
dreamed up.</i>

1288
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:19,543
I really wanted "Speak Now" to
make a difference in the world,

1289
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,410
<i>so I hope you all
catch the vision.</i>

1290
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:25,110
Okay, so here is a list
of all the social media sites

1291
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,778
I wanna hit,
but before that,

1292
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,787
<i>I just wanted you to
know a little bit more</i>

1293
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,687
about Alé and the
Little Lights Children Home

1294
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,590
that we're gonna be
raising awareness for.

1295
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,390
<i>So if you can all
just take a minute</i>

1296
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:37,896
and check out
EmbraceAVillage.org,

1297
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:39,967
<i>then we'll talk about it.</i>

1298
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:42,800
- Hey.
- Hi, it's exciting, huh?

1299
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,302
Yeah.

1300
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,805
Tell me, how are Luke and Ethan
responding to all this?

1301
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,034
Ethan gets it, you know,
he's on board.

1302
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,042
He's actually even
writing something for me.

1303
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,806
What about Luke?

1304
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,381
Luke is a little harder
to talk to these days,

1305
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,475
but it'll honor Alé,
so he'll be glad.

1306
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:02,386
I think you should have a
conversation with him about it,

1307
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,889
before he reads it
on Facebook.

1308
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,390
In fact,
why don't you go now?

1309
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:06,892
I can keep things
going here.

1310
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,984
No professor, I--
There is so much to do.

1311
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,654
I really wanna be here.

1312
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,097
I have timeto talk
to Luke, don't worry.

1313
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,929
I think you're underestimating
your own influence

1314
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:17,129
and the speed
of the Internet.

1315
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,832
I'll talk to Luke, okay?

1316
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:35,043
<i>Luke, good
to see you here.</i>

1317
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,181
How you doing, son?

1318
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,917
I'm hanging in there.

1319
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:41,051
Look, I wanted to tell you
how pleased we are

1320
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,993
with the tribute to Alé.

1321
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,792
I'm gonna ask
a couple of our church folk

1322
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:48,630
to donate a matching fund
to the Kickstaner campaign.

1323
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,795
I'm sorry, what?

1324
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:52,770
Yeah, the fund
for the children's home.

1325
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:56,707
What a wonderful way
to leave a legacy forAlé.

1326
01:13:56,799 --> 01:14:00,372
Pastor, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1327
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,576
<i>Hi, okay, I
brought emergency coffees.</i>

1328
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,083
Thank you.

1329
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,744
Why am I buying
emergency coffee?

1330
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,617
Because "Speak Now"
is speaking.

1331
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:12,784
Yup, we have raised over
$50,000 in less than 24 hours.

1332
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,292
Oh, my gosh,
you're up and running.

1333
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,556
Yep, our first campaign is
for Little Lights Home, look.

1334
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,063
Yeah, we launched
Alé's story,

1335
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,564
and the vision
of Embrace a Village

1336
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,896
on every form of
social media site that exists.

1337
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,596
Yeah, his team has been taking
out the information non-stop.

1338
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,502
- Wow.
- The voice is spreading.

1339
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,233
Okay, what can I do?

1340
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,833
You could make us
some sandwiches.

1341
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,937
- Ooh.
- Good luck with that.

1342
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,313
Hey Luke, dude, come here,
I want you to check this out.

1343
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:38,817
Does it have
anything to do with

1344
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,318
you exploiting
my wife's death

1345
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,252
to give your
company a name?

1346
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:43,755
No.

1347
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,291
That's what I heard
from the pastor.

1348
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:47,258
That's not
what's going on, okay?

1349
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,760
You know about this?

1350
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,262
Yes, I do.

1351
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:51,763
How could you
do this, Ethan?

1352
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,265
Luke, Ethan wrote
a beautiful blog

1353
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:54,766
about Alé and
the children online.

1354
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,268
You should read it.

1355
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:59,271
He's building his business
on the back of my dead wife.

1356
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,898
<i>He's trying to do something
to help the kids at Little Lights.</i>

1357
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,944
I thought you guys
were my best friends.

1358
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:08,014
How could you
be so selfish?

1359
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,319
I was just
trying to help.

1360
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,351
Come on, you guys are
doing something amazing.

1361
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:23,191
He's just-

1362
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:26,357
Alé would be really proud.

1363
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,518
<i>Let me ask you
a hypothetical question.</i>

1364
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,355
Say you had
your dream job.

1365
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:53,552
It was everything you wanted,
but you had to turn your head

1366
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:57,825
to certain practices
that you knew were wrong.

1367
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,331
What would you do?

1368
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:00,832
What would I do?

1369
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,563
A woman alone with a mortgage
and no college diploma?

1370
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,698
<i>What would somebody like
you do, hypothetically?</i>

1371
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:09,707
Who is someone like me?

1372
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,278
<i>Well, a young beauty
with brains and talent</i>

1373
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,643
<i>and integrity...</i>

1374
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,875
and faith.

1375
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:21,682
<i>Oh, I think that young woman
already knows what to do, hmm?</i>

1376
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,623
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

1377
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,456
You too.

1378
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,869
<i>You have a moment, sir?</i>

1379
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,997
Just
it's time for the meeting.

1380
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,837
Did you put everything
together for the Sonji deal?

1381
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,842
Yeah, I think you might
want to take a look

1382
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,503
at my report
before we go in.

1383
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,377
I'm sure it's fine,
Catherine.

1384
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,881
We should go,
come on.

1385
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,612
Well, I know I'm very green
so I just wanted to make sure

1386
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:57,350
that I was catching on
to what you wanted here.

1387
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:18,403
You think I'm gonna let you
show this to the board?

1388
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,911
No sir.

1389
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,539
I just wanted to
make sure I had it rig ht.

1390
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,307
The company
could profit greatly;

1391
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,853
this is a big deal for us.

1392
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,389
And you could
also profit.

1393
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,890
With all due respect, sir,

1394
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,587
that's not how
I want my career to go.

1395
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,186
Let me put it
to you this way:

1396
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:41,098
you don't play ball here,
you go home.

1397
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,232
Home sounds
pretty good to me.

1398
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:50,865
<i>Greetings to
the weary and famished</i>

1399
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,641
<i>Greetings to
the weary and famished</i>

1400
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,981
Alright,
it's pepperoni, man.

1401
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,882
Have you seen
the numbers?

1402
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:01,250
- Remarkable.
- $80,000.

1403
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,220
You haven't
been online lately.

1404
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,724
Why? What?

1405
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,919
With the matching fund added in,
you're within a few hours

1406
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,225
of having the whole lot,
I'd say.

1407
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:15,063
We have to call
Rose and Anil.

1408
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,364
They're not
gonna believe it.

1409
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,466
Hey, good to see you guys.
Hey, how's it going?

1410
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,975
Thank you
so much for coming.

1411
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:26,307
Hey, we're gonna get started
in just a second, okay?

1412
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,280
- Go get interviewed.
- Yeah, yeah, no.

1413
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,248
<i>In front
of the books there?</i>

1414
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,819
<i>Just up
on the side, or-</i>

1415
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,319
I don't know,
just put it somewhere.

1416
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,820
Any word from Luke?

1417
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:37,891
No, I called and texted
like a thousand times,

1418
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,391
but no response.

1419
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,892
What?
You, texting?

1420
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,657
Yes, I know how.

1421
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,164
Man, he has to come.

1422
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,665
Ethan's gonna
give it one more try.

1423
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,167
Okay, good.

1424
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:50,736
Hey, I wanted
to talk to you-

1425
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,195
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

1426
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,673
I was gonna tell you about
it yesterday but I kind of,

1427
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,175
you know, lost track of-

1428
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,869
Okay, well,
let me just say

1429
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,278
I wanted to wait 'til
we gotn the day behind us

1430
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:07,081
but I think we
should date, formally.

1431
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,185
You do?

1432
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,689
Don't you?

1433
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,453
Well, yes, sure.

1434
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:17,189
I just--that's not what I
was gonna say, is the thing.

1435
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,026
- It's not?
- No.

1436
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,101
I was gonna tell you
that I quit my job.

1437
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,695
- You did?
- Uh, yeah.

1438
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,364
Well, good for you.

1439
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,601
- Really?
- Yeah.

1440
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:34,147
You absolutely made the
right choice, from what I hear.

1441
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,045
Okay, okay then.

1442
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,049
Okay, um-

1443
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,847
Actually, I'd like to talk
about that dating thing

1444
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,545
that you mentioned.

1445
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,122
Look, our
guests are here.

1446
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:47,027
Is tomorrow night
too soon to start?

1447
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:48,594
Nope.

1448
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,428
Hi.

1449
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,226
<i>Hey, Professor Callahan.</i>

1450
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,960
Joe, Pat, welcome.

1451
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,695
You must be Jack.
I'm Ryder.

1452
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,203
Nice to meet you,
Ryder.

1453
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,796
You know, I've talked to you
guys so many times on the phone,

1454
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,307
I feel like I know you.

1455
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,104
- Hi, I'm Catherine McGary.
- Hi Catherine, Jack.

1456
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,042
Hi, it's so nice
to meet you.

1457
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,239
And thank you so much again
for flying in for this.

1458
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,747
No, thank you Ryder.

1459
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,250
What you've done
is incredible.

1460
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,786
Uh, so where's Luke?

1461
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,152
Um, he's-
He's not here.

1462
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,918
We're actually
not sure if he's coming.

1463
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,425
<i>It's all been
really hard on him.</i>

1464
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,860
No, he'll be here,
I just know it.

1465
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:31,569
I'm headed to the thing.

1466
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,869
I'm sure everybody's
gonna be asking aboutyou,

1467
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,637
<i>what you're up to,
how you doing.</i>

1468
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:40,304
<i>What do you
want me to tell them?</i>

1469
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,712
Whatever you wrant.

1470
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:49,153
Look, I wanted
to apologize

1471
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:53,920
for jumping on your case
the other day.

1472
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,426
<i>I'm not sorry
for what I said,</i>

1473
01:20:55,517 --> 01:21:00,398
<i>but! 'm sorry
for the way I said it.</i>

1474
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,171
Everyone's emotional.

1475
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,240
Yeah.

1476
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:13,905
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about Alé today.

1477
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:19,645
About how happy she'd be to
see the kids get a new facility.

1478
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,778
<i>I bet she'd be right there,
digging the ground up</i>

1479
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,690
<i>just to get it started,
don't you?</i>

1480
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:30,992
Probably so.

1481
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,191
I was also thinking how
happy she'd be to see you

1482
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:36,701
tell them
about it yourself.

1483
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:46,045
<i>I had the airline change
the ticket to your name.</i>

1484
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:51,083
The date's open-ended so you can
go back whenever you're ready.

1485
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:57,215
And when you get a chance,
read the blog.

1486
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,109
Should we go ahead?

1487
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:20,806
We just don't know if they're
coming, sol say yes, let's go.

1488
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:22,973
Okay.

1489
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,980
Is this on?
Is this on?

1490
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,716
Hey, hey everyone.

1491
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,122
<i>Can I have you all
come in for a second?</i>

1492
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:35,957
<i>I just wanted to say thank you
for coming here tonight.</i>

1493
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:38,622
And a special thanks
to Joe and Pat Clendenny

1494
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,393
<i>and Jack Kennedy
from Embrace a Village</i>

1495
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:41,899
<i>for being here.</i>

1496
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,907
We're here tonight
to pay a special tribute

1497
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,977
to Alexandria Taylor

1498
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,843
and the legacy
that she left behind.

1499
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:03,179
"Speak Now" wanted
to honor her efforts

1500
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:06,088
<i>by continuing
the work there.</i>

1501
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,127
<i>Thanks to all of you
putting forth your time,</i>

1502
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:11,197
efforts, and money
into this campaign,

1503
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:14,529
we were able to raise
the full cost of an addition

1504
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:17,069
to the Little Lights
Children's Home.

1505
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:25,840
Joe, Pat, and Jack,
please come forward.

1506
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:40,958
We are just pleased

1507
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:48,024
to present you with
a check for $100,000.

1508
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,136
Now's your time
for the photo ops, press.

1509
01:23:57,232 --> 01:24:00,805
Joe, please say
a word or two.

1510
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,879
Thank you all
so much, thank you.

1511
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,255
You know,
the harvest is plentiful,

1512
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:15,328
but the workers are few.

1513
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:18,398
We were so blessed to
have had Alé and Luke Taylor

1514
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,897
as a part of our team.

1515
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,399
<i>They were faithful workers</i>

1516
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:26,404
<i>in a place they were
so desperately needed.</i>

1517
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:30,499
Now Luke, don't hide now,
come on up front.

1518
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,887
My friend, I know this is not
the way you saw your life going,

1519
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:54,490
and I know
you're still in pain,

1520
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,626
but the door's
always open to you, Luke,

1521
01:24:56,725 --> 01:25:02,198
if you're ever ready to
carry on with what you began.

1522
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:04,436
You will always
be in our hearts

1523
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,672
and a pan
of Embrace a Village.

1524
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:11,080
And Luke, always
a pan of our family.

1525
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,948
Would you like
to say a few words?

1526
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:23,686
Uh, I want to thank my friends
for doing this in Alé's memory.

1527
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:28,129
It really is an
amazing accomplishment.

1528
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,567
A wise person recently
told me that God's calling

1529
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:33,901
<i>isn't to do something,
but to be something,</i>

1530
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:35,406
<i>you know,
to be obedient</i>

1531
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,204
<i>and find the fulfillment
in God's desires</i>

1532
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,472
in our character
and not our works.

1533
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:43,412
Sol don't know that doing
something for God in India

1534
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,416
<i>is really my calling.</i>

1535
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:48,852
But I do know that I was the
best person I've ever been.

1536
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:50,980
<i>More alive, more fulfilled,</i>

1537
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,286
<i>and passionate
to hear God's voice</i>

1538
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,486
and obey him
when I was in Chennai

1539
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,223
with these kids
and this ministry.

1540
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,661
So are you going back?

1541
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:04,532
I've already got my ticket,
so I guess so.

1542
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:09,474
Tell Raj that
I'll see him soon.

1543
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,544
Thank you so much.

1544
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:15,981
- See you in Chennai.
-You will.

1545
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:24,424
"W.C."

1546
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,049
The world changer's
back, man.

1547
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:44,940
<i>One minute
it's bright and hopeful,</i>

1548
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:51,473
<i>and the next, something
seemingly inexplicable happens,</i>

1549
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,315
but God is there.

1550
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:28,519
Thank you.

1551
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:33,858
What's that?

1552
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:35,359
Boston U.

1553
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,861
Someone couldn't
continue with the program,

1554
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,794
so they had
a spot open up.

1555
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:41,026
I'm first
on the waiting list.

1556
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,533
I'll be a semester behind,

1557
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,126
but hey man,
I'm used to that, right?

1558
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:46,762
Congrats, man!

1559
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,205
It's a good thing
I still have this.

1560
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,209
Oh, no, no, no.

1561
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,211
I wrote this for both of you.
It's still yours.

1562
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:58,114
I'm good, and
you need it now, so.

1563
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,753
Yes !

1564
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:12,897
Ooh, that doesn't seem
like such a good idea to me.

1565
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,398
Oh, but this one does.

1566
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,562
Well, congratulate me, boys.

1567
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:22,506
I am the proud owner
of a used Honda.

1568
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:24,008
Hey!

1569
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,078
Awesome, did you take
the job at the non-profit?

1570
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:27,578
No, no, no.

1571
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,649
I'm staying in the corporate
world; that's my battlefield.

1572
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,876
Took a job with the
investment firm down the street.

1573
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,953
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1574
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,955
<i>One day you
think you have it all figured out</i>

1575
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,615
<i>and then you realize
that there was something</i>

1576
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:42,354
even better
because God is there.

1577
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,298
This is it.

1578
01:28:51,226 --> 01:28:54,207
I'm proud of you, son.

1579
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:57,105
Go show 'em
what you got.

1580
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:59,610
- Will do.
-Yeah.

1581
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:05,777
<i>One day follows
the next, good times and bad times.</i>

1582
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:10,117
<i>Times where your
dreams are on-hold</i>

1583
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:13,818
and times where
they come true.

1584
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:16,759
<i>Times where
you feel alone</i>

1585
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:22,358
<i>and times where you
feel love overwhelming.</i>

1586
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:25,131
<i>Times where
you make sacrifices</i>

1587
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:29,072
<i>and times where you are
overwhelmed by blessings</i>

1588
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:34,237
<i>because you're obedient
and God is there.</i>

1589
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:39,011
<i>He takes all these times
and he works in you,</i>

1590
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:42,680
<i>he works through you.</i>

1591
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:45,121
<i>Give it all to him.</i>

1592
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,160
<i>This is his time.</i>

1593
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:56,864
Hi, I'm Joe Clendenny,
founder of Embrace a Village.

1594
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:59,700
I hope you enjoyed the film,
but more than that,

1595
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:02,536
I hope you will walk away
with an understanding

1596
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,406
of how each life can
make a huge difference

1597
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,946
and can impact
many others.

1598
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:09,845
Though the characters
of Luke and Alé

1599
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,610
are fictitious
in the movie,

1600
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,447
the stories
of Embrace a Village

1601
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,487
and the Little Lights
children's program

1602
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,146
are very true.

1603
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,988
<i>Embrace a Village is a vibrant,
humanitarian organization</i>

1604
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,584
<i>in India today.</i>

1605
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:25,893
<i>We exist to help transform
the lives of leprosy victims</i>

1606
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:29,696
<i>and their families, many
of whom you saw in this film.</i>

1607
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,635
<i>Our mission continues to be
bringing Jesus Christ's</i>

1608
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:36,675
<i>message of hope and healing
to these forgotten people;</i>

1609
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:41,804
people like little Raj, who came
to us at 3 years old, unnamed.

1610
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,746
<i>Today Raj is thriving.</i>

1611
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,785
<i>He's being educated,
learning two languages,</i>

1612
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:48,854
<i>studying God's Word daily,</i>

1613
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:52,891
<i>and has positive dreams for
a bright and prosperous future,</i>

1614
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,790
but he is just
one story of so many.

1615
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:58,489
I invite you to watch
the special 3-minute video

1616
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:01,123
of Embrace a Village
on this DVD

1617
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:04,226
and to join us
in this heartfelt calling

1618
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:06,327
to reach
these hurting people.

1619
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:09,704
The harvest is plentiful,
but the workers are few.

1620
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,470
Won't you support us?

1621
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:14,308
For more information

1622
