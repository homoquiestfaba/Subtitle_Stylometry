1
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,179
Why me?

2
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,490
Why do I have to die now?

3
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:28,435
I'm honoured to personally thank our very own "Insect Man"...

4
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:29,482
- Who was good enough to take... - Can you see him?

5
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:31,235
..A couple of days out from his hectic shooting schedule

6
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,364
and fly back here for the opening.

7
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,176
Mesdames et messieurs, ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,267
Mr. Alan Osborn.

9
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,473
I'll keep this very brief.

10
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,428
When I was a kid, I dreamed of this,

11
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:57,301
and everybody either laughed at me

12
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,482
or screamed bloody murder.

13
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:04,283
It's taken a long, long time

14
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:08,624
and a lot of sacrifice to make it happen.

15
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,147
Now it's... now it's done,

16
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:17,492
and um... and I have to get back to work

17
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,193
as you have to get back to yours.

18
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,400
And so thank you very much.

19
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,176
Merci d'etre venus si nombreux!

20
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,395
Are you ready?

21
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:29,246
Let's go!

22
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:32,346
Blue morpho! Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

23
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,885
Sorry.

24
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,223
Mr. Osborn?

25
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,668
Did you get my messages?

26
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:40,746
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,266
I'm Pete Carlton.

28
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,737
And I want to go to the rainforest with you

29
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:46,077
to find the Blue Morpho butterfly.

30
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,848
You said it's the most beautiful creature you've ever seen.

31
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:51,399
And you can get answers to the mysteries of the world,

32
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,559
just by looking at it.

33
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,809
Here. This is my resume.

34
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,378
I need to get there right away.

35
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:10,227
I appreciate your, um, your enthusiasm,

36
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:13,878
my little entomologist friend, but...

37
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,957
...the season is almost over.

38
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,895
The book says the morpho season goes on for another week.

39
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,339
- Yeah, but... - I'm his mom.

40
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,377
Could we talk just for a second?

41
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,827
Yeah. I have to be at another interview in five minutes.

42
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:29,653
Okay. Uh, you wait for me here,

43
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:31,900
darling, okay? I'll be back.

44
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:51,262
His doctors have given him three to six months to live.

45
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,899
Not that I buy that, but...

46
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:55,722
... his dream is to catch a blue butterfly,

47
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,478
and it's not just a whim.

48
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,572
Brain cancer?

49
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,718
We've been waiting to see if the chemotherapy helped,

50
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:03,727
but they just found out recently

51
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,946
that there's nothing else they can do.

52
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,578
Look. I mean, I appreciate the problem.

53
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:12,002
I do, but...

54
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,701
...just like I said, the season is over.

55
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,522
Yeah.

56
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,186
In case no one's noticed, he's in a wheelchair.

57
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,573
Yes. The tumour throws him off balance.

58
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:31,898
Sorry. Mr. Osborn, we're a bit pushed for time.

59
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,006
If we're going to make the interview,

60
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,790
we should leave right now.

61
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,824
Regarde, cheri.

62
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,192
Mr. Osborn?

63
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:59,917
If you had a child of your own, and you held him in your arms,

64
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:01,640
I know you'd know exactly why I'm here,

65
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,031
and what this means to me.

66
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,758
You'd just love him.

67
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,976
He thinks you're the greatest.

68
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,002
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

69
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,594
Excuse us.

70
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,259
Did you say I couldn't walk?

71
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:44,281
Because I could walk a little if I had to.

72
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,105
Look. You sleep tight,

73
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:52,198
and we'll figure out something in the morning. Okay?

74
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:56,717
You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

75
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,073
Don't you?

76
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:01,170
Don't ever think that.

77
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,535
Sometimes, there are things I just can't tell mom.

78
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,881
I mean, she's never lied to me,

79
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:23,376
but it doesn't mean she's always told me the truth.

80
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,439
Maybe we're just not afraid of the same things.

81
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:31,076
All she ever thinks about is me being sick,

82
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,406
me dying.

83
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:37,644
She never says it, but I know she does.

84
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,259
You have fourteen new messages.

85
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:58,633
Hi, Mr. Osborn.

86
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,229
I'm a kid named Pete Carlton.

87
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,655
I love your show.

88
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,830
I was wondering if you could give me a call.

89
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:05,946
I've got a great idea,

90
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,185
and I know we think exactly the same.

91
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:10,726
Soon as you can. Thanks.

92
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,644
Hi, me again. Pete Carlton.

93
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:19,550
You know when I first knew I had to catch that morpho?

94
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,423
Two years ago. I was in the hospital,

95
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,034
and I had chemotherapy,

96
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,998
and all these tubes were jabbed into me.

97
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,816
My mom brought me a video of your show,

98
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,474
and I saw that Blue Morpho flying.

99
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,798
It was unbelievable.

100
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,299
I had a dream that night in the hospital

101
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:37,237
that I caught the morpho and I held it,

102
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,317
and then I got these blue wings.

103
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:42,196
I was this boy with blue wings.

104
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:47,134
Man, I could just fly away like crazy.

105
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:50,052
And then you said how it's magic.

106
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:53,615
Ever since, I just dream about catching that morpho,

107
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,401
because I have a lot of questions I want to ask it.

108
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,276
Great to meet you today.

109
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,863
I know you're busy,

110
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:03,064
but I want to tell you I'm leaving.

111
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,340
I'm off to the rainforest now.

112
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:07,211
I'm running out of time.

113
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,833
I know you're the only one who'd understand.

114
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,391
Could you explain it to my mom, please?

115
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,386
Thanks a lot for two years of your show.

116
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:16,994
It's the best show in the world.

117
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:26,257
Yes. Yes. I'm coming.

118
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,025
Mr. Osborn?!

119
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:33,615
I'm sorry to come by so late.

120
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:36,035
I tried to phone but the lines were busy.

121
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,532
Oh, it's okay. Please, come in.

122
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,734
Is your son here?

123
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,484
Of course. Hang on. I'll just get him.

124
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:41,779
No, no, I just um...

125
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:42,924
Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.

126
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,809
He reads until midnight anyway.

127
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,566
- I just.. - Pete! Just a second.

128
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,386
- I got a message... - Hey! Pete.

129
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:50,873
Hey, Pete!

130
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,916
Pete?

131
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,560
What?

132
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,476
I don't know how he did it.

133
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:11,529
He's gone to the airport.

134
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,385
This is why I was calling.

135
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:17,177
Hi, I'm um... I'm... just hang on.

136
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,020
Hang on a second, please?

137
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,272
Teresa Beauchamps Carlton?

138
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:23,469
Oui?

139
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:25,485
It's me. Pete!!

140
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,647
We picked him up at the airport.

141
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,606
382 dollars in his pocket,

142
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,391
and the worst fake passport in history.

143
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,744
When that didn't pan out, he tried bribery.

144
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,578
It worked on the cab driver.

145
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,885
What the hell were you thinking?

146
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,698
Don't make me say it.

147
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,253
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:46,856
Did you tell Mr. Osborn to say no?

149
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,958
Did I what?

150
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:51,093
Best guy in the world.

151
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,871
I can't believe he'd say no.

152
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:56,330
I mean, the guy can do anything.

153
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,778
Mr. Osborn?

154
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:19,713
Look! I'll take you.

155
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,918
I'll give you a few days in the rainforest.

156
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,287
That's all I can do. If we don't find it,

157
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,355
it's too late. That's it.

158
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,142
That's all we need.

159
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:31,727
We'll find it. It'll answer everything.

160
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,779
I'm not good with kids.

161
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:42,745
So don't ask too many questions, okay?

162
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,224
I won't.

163
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:45,389
Didn't you say just to hold it

164
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:47,541
is to understand a little bit more about the world?

165
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:48,818
听着  它仅仅是只蝴蝶
Look, it's a butterfly.

166
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,132
I was being poetic, you know, I mean for the TV.

167
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,830
Didn't you say seeing the morpho changed your life?

168
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,883
Will you stop asking questions?

169
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:59,964
If you don't think that, why are you taking me?

170
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,636
Why do you think I'm taking you? Look at you.

171
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:04,793
He wants to catch a butterfly.

172
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,198
- That's why... - Pete!

173
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:09,362
- Oh! Christ! - Sorry.

174
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,197
Stumped?

175
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,721
Aren't you ever gonna get some sleep?

176
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:28,662
Who's Maria?

177
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:32,762
You like her?

178
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,655
You like her.

179
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,990
I don't know her very well.

180
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:43,155
What do you mean you don't know her well?

181
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,657
I've never even seen her walk.

182
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,796
Paraplegic?

183
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:51,140
What?

184
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:53,000
You said she couldn't walk.

185
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,685
Why don't we just think about the..

186
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:00,831
..The butterfly, the Mariposa Azul.

187
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,531
I'm trying,

188
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:05,185
but how can you say it's... it's magic,

189
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,783
and it has all these answers?

190
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,262
And now you're saying you lied?

191
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:17,141
Look.

192
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:20,339
It is magic.

193
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:21,671
I mean it did point

194
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:23,962
my life in a new direction when I first saw it,

195
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,568
but you can't go around telling people

196
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,268
that or they think you're crazy, you know?

197
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:31,552
Okay?

198
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,483
Now get some sleep...

199
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:36,170
... before we land.

200
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:19,719
Hola!

201
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:47,036
Look at the monkeys, mom!

202
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,119
Spider monkeys.

203
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,332
These past few days,

204
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:51,534
I've been afraid something would happen

205
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:54,684
at the last minute and stop us from coming,

206
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:58,496
I can't believe I'm in the jungle with Mom

207
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:01,698
who is terrified of snakes and creepy crawlies

208
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,597
and with Mr. Osborn

209
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:05,891
who loves insects more than anything in the world.

210
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:19,065
Yana!

211
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,503
Hola, Guillermo.

212
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,108
Look at these kids.

213
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:07,162
We weren't expecting you for months

214
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,561
我没来得不及告诉你

215
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:23,094
This is Yana and her father

216
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,235
Alejo.

217
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:25,586
Hi, Pete!

218
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,612
Nice to meet you.

219
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:32,741
我们来这想捉一只蓝色的蝴蝶

220
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:34,631
-现在吗  -没错

221
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:34,778
It's a little late in the season, que no?

222
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,829
Yeah, it's a little late, but we're pretty sure

223
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:42,050
there are still some floating around, right, Pete?

224
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,170
Yeah.

225
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
搬他们的行李

226
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,332
Long journey?

227
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:55,731
Yeah. Good to see you.

228
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,808
I'm never tired when I'm coming here,

229
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,496
only when I'm leaving.

230
00:17:58,626 --> 00:17:59,559
It's good to see you.

231
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:00,648
You too.

232
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:09,801
Our shaman Diego will tell you

233
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,657
one of our blue butterfly legends.

234
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,848
These legends become more and more precious.

235
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,449
We fight for the forest,

236
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:17,913
but we fight for our language

237
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,319
and our beliefs just as hard.

238
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:21,520
Sounds like a good fight.

239
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,005
Pete's a good little fighter himself.

240
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:24,898
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

241
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:27,459
He has the eyes of a warrior.

242
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:11,767
The blue butterfly is a magical creature.

243
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:16,029
And, at the moment you see it,

244
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:20,069
you must offer the blue butterfly your dreams

245
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:20,666
and the blue butterfly

246
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:24,204
will take your dreams to the Great Spirit.

247
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:44,521
This is the other side of the story.

248
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:49,193
Evil spirits inhabit the jungle.

249
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:53,280
Evil spirits that hide what they are

250
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:55,916
and become other animals.

251
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,770
But their favourite disguise

252
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,326
is to become Mariposa Azul.

253
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,759
The Blue Morpho uses his beauty

254
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,843
to lead people into the forest

255
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,821
to be lost forever.

256
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:10,359
That's comforting. Mm?

257
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:13,570
He says once they are lost,

258
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,302
they will be attacked

259
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:17,028
by wild tribes.

260
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,022
Okay, that's enough.

261
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:19,412
Cannibals, headhunters,

262
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:23,592
who will use with their spears and their knives to dig into...

263
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:27,041
Are we gonna get our heads cut off?

264
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,772
Yeah. Probably.

265
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,266
There goes my tumour.

266
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:36,631
你下顿饭的肉里撒了尿  你这老酒鬼

267
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,620
Where's Yana's mother?

268
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:47,566
It was a difficult birth.

269
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,206
She died giving birth to Yana?

270
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:52,946
Yeah.

271
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:56,327
These are for her. I'll be right back.

272
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,282
I'm worried about him.

273
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:11,425
What are you talking about?

274
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,185
Mm m... Nothing.

275
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,975
Oh, come on. Don't pull that crap.

276
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,297
He's got girl problems.

277
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:28,580
He's in love with a paraplegic girl named Maria.

278
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,944
He likes her

279
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:33,837
plus she can't walk.

280
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,222
He told you that?

281
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,699
He said what he said. The thing is,

282
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:41,623
he doesn't have a woman to talk to about it.

283
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:44,554
He kind of hinted he wanted to talk to you.

284
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:49,509
Why are you so obsessed with finding me a partner?

285
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:51,472
Because you date idiots.

286
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,732
You're an idiot.

287
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,385
Forget it.

288
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:58,839
I just want to catch the morpho

289
00:21:58,914 --> 00:21:59,781
while you guys spend your lives

290
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:02,540
thinking about things that don't matter.

291
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,873
Mom, stop it. I'm trying to concentrate!

292
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,836
Oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:19,508
Mom.

294
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:20,951
What?

295
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,492
I think I'm gonna throw up.

296
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,194
- Really? - Really.

297
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:27,940
Here. Here!

298
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:29,300
Oh, Pete.

299
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:44,538
His doctors say that it's okay

300
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:47,077
for him to be here though, right?

301
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,484
No...

302
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:55,976
No, they would think bringing him here is crazy.

303
00:22:57,026 --> 00:23:00,595
They also think he's gonna die in a few months.So,

304
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,079
I told them where they could put their craziness.

305
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,854
Okay. Now...

306
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,069
It's Tai Chi.

307
00:23:56,162 --> 00:24:00,365
You keep your weight down, in tune.

308
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,144
Watch how I move.

309
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,465
It's a dance.

310
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:09,497
You keep your eye on it.

311
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,970
You pivot.

312
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,550
You turn.

313
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:24,656
You pivot.

314
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:28,696
You turn.

315
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:54,072
And you...

316
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,378
And you...swipe!

317
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:05,673
And that's it

318
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:09,625
Dragonfly!

319
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:10,762
Yeah.

320
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:26,079
Odonata, dragonfly.

321
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,147
And it's a very good sign...

322
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:31,074
that the blue morpho is still around.

323
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,133
Now you try it.

324
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:38,519
I'm not sure I can...

325
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,160
On my shoulders.

326
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,378
Up you go. Up !

327
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,667
Can you stand?

328
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:49,475
Okay, I'll be your legs. You get up.

329
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,524
Atta boy,

330
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,512
okay. You're ready?

331
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,587
Yeah .

332
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:58,074
Now, we're a team.

333
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,876
It's great up here. I like this view.

334
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,632
Picture the morpho. Picture it, okay?

335
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:06,009
There it is.

336
00:26:06,754 --> 00:26:09,022
Zooming in, right?

337
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,689
You're ready?

338
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:12,154
You're ready?

339
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:42,946
- Kingdom . - Kingdom .

340
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,509
- Phylum . - Phylum .

341
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,077
- Class. - Class.

342
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:48,112
- Order. - Order.

343
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:49,294
- Family. - Family.

344
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,677
- Genus. - Genus.

345
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:52,086
- Species. - Species.

346
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,495
- No. - No? Is that wrong?

347
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:21,008
OK. This'll be our first stop.

348
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:00,328
Remember. The most important: always keep your balance.

349
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:02,336
There, see that one. Let's give that a try.

350
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,533
Okay.

351
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,749
Way to go, Pete.

352
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:06,298
That's it. There.

353
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:12,014
- There. - Where?

354
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,763
There.

355
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:14,131
Go for it.

356
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,228
Higher!

357
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,296
- There. - That's it.

358
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:20,346
You got it?

359
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,783
You should see it, mom. Look at it.

360
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,116
Let's see.

361
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:26,582
Look at that.

362
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,757
Esperanza Orthoptera.

363
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:32,229
It looks totally unreal.

364
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,233
Look at that.

365
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:39,338
Yeah.

366
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,500
I know I thought we'd find it back there,

367
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:45,295
but this next clearing is really something .

368
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:08,993
Manolo, bring Pete over.

369
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:23,954
Rhino Beetle. Genus Megasoma.

370
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:27,807
Magnificent.

371
00:29:28,514 --> 00:29:32,283
You know it can carry 900 times its own weight?

372
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:35,223
But we're gonna find the morpho, right?

373
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:38,759
Yeah,

374
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:42,578
but I'm trying to show you some things along the way.

375
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:45,289
Some great things.

376
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:47,121
Right.

377
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,801
Definitely.

378
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,660
Morphos love water.

379
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,449
The waterfall is irresistible to them!

380
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,669
I think we should head back for today.

381
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:27,239
Mom? You heard Mr. Osborn.

382
00:30:27,297 --> 00:30:29,365
Morphos love waterfalls.

383
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:31,743
He knows exactly what he's doing.

384
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:33,754
Is everything okay?

385
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,446
Pretty good .

386
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,834
Step by step, we're tracking that baby.

387
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,789
We just have to be patient...

388
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,062
How is Pete?

389
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:18,326
I think he's having the time of his life.

390
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:19,502
Can I get you something to drink?

391
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,684
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

392
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:23,701
You okay?

393
00:32:23,873 --> 00:32:27,209
Yeah. Have a seat.

394
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:40,608
This is a bit embarrassing, but um...

395
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,542
Pete said you might want to talk to me

396
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,860
about a girl problem?

397
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,977
A girl problem?

398
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,725
Yeah. Yeah, he said you...

399
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:59,855
you have a paraplegic girlfriend? Maria?

400
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,114
And who are you? Dr.Ruth of the jungle?

401
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,306
Just asking?

402
00:33:06,305 --> 00:33:09,107
No. No girlfriend.

403
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:23,258
Porque?

404
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:26,412
Why?

405
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,461
Why is the blue butterfly so important?

406
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:33,747
What?

407
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:37,309
Why is the blue butterfly so important?

408
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,688
The blue butterfly?

409
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:49,614
Because... it's the blue butterfly.

410
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:53,703
It's a miracle.

411
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:55,992
Yes, but...

412
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:05,791
This is also the blue butterfly.

413
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,014
No.

414
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,664
Horn beetle.

415
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:13,611
You blue butterfly.

416
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,063
Me blue butterfly.

417
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:17,267
Everything is the blue butterfly.

418
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:19,321
Todo?

419
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:20,759
Everything?

420
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:23,179
No.

421
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:27,035
Only the blue butterfly is the blue butterfly.

422
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:28,766
You don't understand anything.

423
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:31,905
What about you?

424
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:35,036
Lots of success in the relationship department?

425
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,835
Well, Pete's tried.

426
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,054
He wrote the butcher a love note in my name,

427
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,281
saying how much I loved his pork chops.

428
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:46,114
And he told the plumber

429
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,643
I had problems with my pipes.

430
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,940
Can I ask what happened to his dad?

431
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:53,822
He died when Pete was five.

432
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,490
A car accident.

433
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:57,887
He was killed by a drunk driver.

434
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:03,388
I'm sorry.

435
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:12,238
I'm not really the relationship type myself.

436
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:17,425
I come from a long line of lousy and angry fathers.

437
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,576
I didn't want to become one,

438
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:22,492
so I collected insects instead .

439
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,678
That sounds lame.

440
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:30,519
Well, I haven't read your How-To-Be-Perfect book yet.

441
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:32,637
I hear it's good.

442
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,838
I'm sorry. I was...out of line.

443
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,004
I should get back.

444
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,703
Teresa? I'm...

445
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:49,072
I'm not at all sure we're gonna catch that butterfly tomorrow.

446
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:53,223
Trying to move with the whole group, it's...

447
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:56,551
I'm sure the morpho can hear us

448
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:57,616
coming like a brass band.

449
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,992
Good night.

450
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,734
Look, mom! Astratogus.

451
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:12,777
I'll get a jar.

452
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:13,963
Okay.

453
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:18,926
I was thinking of what Yana said yesterday.

454
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,158
Maybe I haven't understood anything.

455
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:26,695
Anyway, catching the Blue Morpho may be a crazy dream,

456
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,564
but dreaming is all I have left...

457
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,701
你的收藏又丰富了很多
You added a lot to your collection.

458
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,321
There's a small swamp we have to cross up here.

459
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:31,267
Oh, great.

460
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,760
It's okay, mom.

461
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:45,177
The days are longer and longer.

462
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,804
It's not easy to keep believing,

463
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:51,309
especially now that mom seems tired of the whole thing.

464
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:53,440
It's tough on her,

465
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:55,838
but it's not easy for me either.

466
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:57,776
You're choking me.

467
00:38:57,889 --> 00:38:59,189
Sorry.

468
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,760
Guys, they're insects. They're sensitive.

469
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:14,078
I'm lugging a wheelchair through a swamp!

470
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:15,616
Yeah, it's funny!

471
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,767
Yeah it's funny!

472
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,116
Sorry.

473
00:39:27,777 --> 00:39:28,911
Hey, Pete, you see this?

474
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:30,660
You see this flower?

475
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:37,848
You see this little flower...

476
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:44,773
and this little beetle?

477
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:47,004
- Yeah. - This is the only way!

478
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:49,306
They depend on each other.

479
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,629
Beetle, pollinator.

480
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:54,872
No beetle,no flower.

481
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:58,648
No flower, homeless beetle.

482
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,199
Symbiosis.

483
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:02,814
Exactly.

484
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:06,885
Are there snakes in here?

485
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:08,845
A little quiet, please?

486
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:11,819
What about crocodiles?

487
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:14,373
Teresa, we need quiet.

488
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah .

489
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,036
What's that?

490
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,719
I just felt something against my leg!

491
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:24,532
- Jesus! - Mom!

492
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:26,942
I just felt something against my leg!

493
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:30,411
Christ! Pete ! You come back here! Pete!

494
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:31,934
- Bring him back here! - He's safe!

495
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,434
Just get out of the water.

496
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:34,129
Pete, you come on this side!

497
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:34,913
Alejo, see what it is.

498
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,542
Bring him here!

499
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:42,679
Oh, my God!

500
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,119
Oh, what's that?

501
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:49,362
Your mom came and spoke to me last night,

502
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:51,475
on your advice.

503
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:53,398
She's nice, huh?

504
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:56,016
What's that?

505
00:40:58,145 --> 00:40:59,712
Oh, my God!

506
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:04,546
What I'm about to say is between you and me only,

507
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,747
Okay? You got that?

508
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:08,272
Yeah .

509
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:13,277
Maria is my daughter.

510
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,217
She's not paraplegic.

511
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:18,258
I haven't seen her walk...

512
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,781
because I... abandoned her

513
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:25,712
and her mother before she could walk,

514
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:27,726
seventeen years ago.

515
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:28,757
What are you doing?

516
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,629
Don't move.

517
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:31,328
What are you doing?

518
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:39,586
I'm not a hero. I'm not even a good guy.

519
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:45,066
I'm just good at insects. Okay?

520
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:48,776
So let's just stick to chasing the morpho.

521
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:52,203
Isn't that why we came here?

522
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:53,556
Yeah.

523
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:57,962
It's okay. Good!

524
00:41:58,753 --> 00:41:59,987
Okay, enough is enough!

525
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:02,231
Let's get back in and cross to the other side.

526
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:04,039
Unless you point to a blue butterfly,

527
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:06,697
I am never going back in that bloody swamp!

528
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:25,530
If we'd come here two weeks ago,

529
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:27,899
we'd be in an airplane by now,

530
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,517
headed home with a few morphos.

531
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:36,330
And now, the last resort:

532
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:39,252
the oldest and best trick in the book.

533
00:42:39,297 --> 00:42:41,098
Alejo, if you would?

534
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:43,954
Peach...

535
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:48,325
Schnapps, which has never failed me,

536
00:42:48,354 --> 00:42:49,787
except when I drank it myself.

537
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:51,523
Remember, that enchanting story about me

538
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:54,486
lying in a hammock in sunny Peru.

539
00:42:55,265 --> 00:42:58,500
The insect flies by and changes my life

540
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:00,629
I was pissed at the gills.

541
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:03,536
It's the last drink I ever had.

542
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:11,085
And the insect was the Blue Morpho.

543
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,409
Here.

544
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:18,304
You're okay?

545
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,267
Everybody, quiet!

546
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:26,435
And now we wait!

547
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:21,800
Hey, Pete?

548
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:23,088
Pete?

549
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:28,991
Look at that. Ready?

550
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:34,030
What?

551
00:44:34,145 --> 00:44:35,345
If I wanted him closer,

552
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:36,089
I would have brought him closer.

553
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,725
The chair is a repellant.

554
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:49,185
Do you think there's still a chance, Mr. Osborn?

555
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:50,251
No, I'm a total moron,

556
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:52,003
and this is a complete show.

557
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:53,431
Hey, he's just asking .

558
00:44:53,537 --> 00:44:54,771
This is my fault?

559
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:56,182
No, there's no fault.

560
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,658
We're all just trying to find a blue morpho, right?

561
00:44:58,721 --> 00:45:00,155
Are we?

562
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:04,520
Clanging wheelchairs. Talking. Bustling.

563
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:14,608
It'll be okay, Mr. Osborn.

564
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,423
We're having a great day.

565
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:18,578
God, you know,

566
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:20,129
I swear I can smell it!

567
00:45:21,057 --> 00:45:23,292
It gives off this beautiful sweet fragrance.

568
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:25,295
Can you smell it, Alejo?

569
00:45:26,177 --> 00:45:29,413
There's a lot of sweet things here, Alan.

570
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:30,808
No, that is-

571
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:35,665
Whatever! Non believers.

572
00:45:38,273 --> 00:45:40,307
There is still a chance.

573
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:47,867
If we're patient. And no movement.

574
00:45:52,993 --> 00:45:54,527
Mr. Osborn?

575
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,489
I still believe.

576
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:08,470
When my mom looks at me, I smile back.

577
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:11,900
I want her to know that I believe in what we're doing,

578
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:14,251
but deep down I worry.

579
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:15,103
I'm sorry, Pete.

580
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:17,735
She spent all her money to get me here.

581
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:20,827
I want to say "Look around

582
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,566
You'll never see anything so beautiful again. "

583
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:25,252
but I figured it's the kind of thing

584
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:27,212
I should keep to myself.

585
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:29,514
What are you doing, Mom?

586
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,334
I'm pissed off.

587
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,128
We came ten thousand miles.

588
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,682
We saw black ones, yellow ones,

589
00:46:34,785 --> 00:46:36,186
green ones, white ones,

590
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:37,056
purple, red,

591
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:37,751
burnt

592
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,630
um ber for God's sake.

593
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:43,147
Oh, look! A bloody brown one!

594
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,267
Brown! I think you're ugly!

595
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:46,208
You call yourself the Great Spirit.

596
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:47,670
Brown?

597
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:50,557
Would it be too much to ask for one blue one?

598
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,092
That's right. Just push me over.

599
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:53,693
I'll be a stink bug .

600
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:54,292
Female?

601
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:54,904
- What is it? - You bet it is.

602
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:56,376
- Get the net. - Female morpho, mom .

603
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,949
And where there's a female, there's a blue male.

604
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,492
We got ourselves a morpho,

605
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,393
Petie-boy. Get that net ready!

606
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:05,682
I'm ready.

607
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:13,144
Come on, you son of a... daughter of a...

608
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:17,009
Lead me to the blue God!

609
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:18,127
I knew I could smell it.

610
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:19,708
We're gaining on it!

611
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:23,589
Okay, when I say now.

612
00:47:25,185 --> 00:47:26,318
Okay?

613
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,000
- Now! -I got

614
00:47:42,305 --> 00:47:44,439
Damn it! I couldn't get enough speed .

615
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:49,888
I knew it was here.

616
00:47:50,017 --> 00:47:51,951
I could smell it. I could.

617
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:01,085
Pete?

618
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:29,614
No!

619
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:39,726
No! Stop!

620
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,056
Pete...

621
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:42,563
I saw the natives.

622
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,248
You're burning up.

623
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:50,536
They tried to scream.

624
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:59,685
But...but they couldn't.

625
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:09,487
And then we danced.

626
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:12,863
Just try to breathe deeply.

627
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:16,430
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

628
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:07,178
Mom.

629
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:09,338
What?

630
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:14,909
I want to go into the rainforest with Mr. Osborn tomorrow.

631
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:17,015
Yeah, of course we'll go.

632
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:20,227
No.

633
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:23,267
I mean

634
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,020
just me and Mr. Osborn.

635
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:41,718
It's the only way the morpho's gonna come to us.

636
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:43,328
The group...

637
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,875
It's too big,

638
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:47,753
too noisy.

639
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,025
You're here because you love me.

640
00:51:52,097 --> 00:51:54,165
Alejo and Manolo.

641
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,379
They're here to carry the stuff.

642
00:51:59,777 --> 00:52:02,045
Me and Mr. Osborn.

643
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:05,782
We're the only ones here for the butterfly.

644
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:14,178
That's true...

645
00:52:17,857 --> 00:52:19,625
But I'm your mom.

646
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:25,060
I have to go.

647
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:33,866
The morpho knows what's going on, mom.

648
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,223
He knows.

649
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,667
How's Pete?

650
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,608
I've never seen him like that.

651
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:10,796
He seems peaceful now.

652
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:14,439
Is he gonna be strong enough to go back

653
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:16,694
into the jungle tomorrow?

654
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:19,709
- Listen. - Just let me...

655
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:23,173
say something first.

656
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:27,748
Seventeen years ago,

657
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:31,976
I made a decision that changed everything about my life.

658
00:53:33,185 --> 00:53:36,354
Maria's mother decided that she didn't wanna

659
00:53:37,025 --> 00:53:41,429
follow me around while I caught bugs.

660
00:53:43,713 --> 00:53:46,181
Pretty reasonable decision.

661
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:49,912
But I have been thinking about her,

662
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,809
trying to write her,

663
00:53:55,616 --> 00:54:01,221
and...and wanting to be part of her life.

664
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:06,519
But am I wanted? You know, I...

665
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,657
I blew it a long time ago.

666
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:23,865
Pete wants only the two of you to

667
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:25,245
go into the rainforest tomorrow.

668
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:30,295
He says...only you two understand.

669
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,028
You know he's letting me go, don't you?

670
00:54:36,097 --> 00:54:36,864
No.

671
00:54:36,992 --> 00:54:41,629
The little bugger.

672
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:48,362
Because he knows when he dies, it'll kill me.

673
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:55,063
He's been my whole life.

674
00:54:55,649 --> 00:54:57,550
-He's so brave. - Yeah.

675
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,501
And he's only ten.

676
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:07,184
He's only ten.

677
00:55:14,785 --> 00:55:15,918
It's a terrible vacation.

678
00:55:16,065 --> 00:55:17,332
Yeah.

679
00:55:22,593 --> 00:55:25,395
If you want him to go alone with me,

680
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:29,344
I'll... I'll take him.

681
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:32,280
I will have him back by sundown

682
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:35,141
and I'll protect him with my life.

683
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:41,574
If... If you don't want him to go alone,

684
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,245
I'll understand, and I'll tell him.

685
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:47,984
That's better

686
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:51,516
if we all go together.

687
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,400
Don't move.

688
00:56:13,697 --> 00:56:15,464
好
I won't.

689
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:34,270
I got it.

690
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:35,678
Thank you.

691
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:52,409
How does this feel?

692
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:54,863
Better than on the shoulder.

693
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:58,084
It's good on the back too.

694
00:56:58,177 --> 00:56:58,910
Okay.

695
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,810
Okay. Let's see if it can carry big Pete.

696
00:57:01,856 --> 00:57:03,290
Wait!

697
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:05,913
等等

698
00:57:10,369 --> 00:57:11,669
For me?

699
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,428
This necklace has a warrior power.

700
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:23,989
She make it for you

701
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:26,996
because she say you drink too much soda pop.

702
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Okay.

703
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:04,113
Just give us a second, please?

704
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,867
You can go with Alan.

705
00:58:14,945 --> 00:58:16,912
You won't regret it.

706
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:18,159
Not for a minute.

707
00:58:18,273 --> 00:58:20,541
I already regret it.

708
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:25,954
Mom, remember? Even if I get eaten by

709
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:30,421
wild pigs or ants or an anaconda,

710
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:33,067
it'll only take a couple of months of my life.

711
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:40,277
There is something I really want to tell you.

712
00:58:42,337 --> 00:58:45,139
You're becoming a bit of a smart-ass.

713
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:33,603
Okay.

714
00:59:37,728 --> 00:59:39,496
Okay, Pete.

715
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,136
Now, I understand what Yana meant.

716
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,468
Magic isn't only the Blue Morpho,

717
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:03,870
it's every living thing here.

718
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:06,370
That's why Yana gave me the necklace

719
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:08,300
not only to protect me,

720
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:10,653
but to make me part of this life.

721
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:13,537
Today, right now,

722
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,902
everything is crystal clear to me.

723
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:33,711
Look who we have here?

724
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:38,716
You okay?

725
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:40,750
Fine. You?

726
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:43,388
I'm good.

727
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:28,942
Not even one! I can't believe it!

728
01:01:49,825 --> 01:01:51,492
Now, I'm really, really

729
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:52,818
pissed!

730
01:01:56,832 --> 01:01:58,366
Don't you ever get mad?

731
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:01,980
About what?

732
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,482
You're a kid, and you're dying .

733
01:02:07,552 --> 01:02:10,554
Let's just stick to catching the butterfly, okay?

734
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:11,572
Yeah.

735
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:13,378
Isn't that what you said?

736
01:02:15,457 --> 01:02:16,857
That's what I said .

737
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,282
I'm just not a mad kind of person .

738
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:29,171
Pete, I want you to know

739
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,815
when I get home I'm gonna contact Maria.

740
01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:34,515
I'm gonna try to make up

741
01:02:34,657 --> 01:02:37,225
for what an ignorant person I've been .

742
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:41,835
I think she'd like that.

743
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,861
You're great company.

744
01:02:46,048 --> 01:02:47,816
You're mad.

745
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:48,604
I'm not mad.

746
01:02:48,737 --> 01:02:49,971
Yeah.

747
01:02:51,777 --> 01:02:53,211
Let's just go.

748
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,036
Don't tell me you're not mad.

749
01:02:56,129 --> 01:02:57,496
I'm not mad.

750
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,256
I like you.

751
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:03,079
I like you too.

752
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:41,622
Swallowtail

753
01:03:41,728 --> 01:03:43,663
Yeah, you bet it is.

754
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:46,559
It's paradise.

755
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:49,504
You want that one for your collection?

756
01:03:49,633 --> 01:03:52,068
No. Blue morpho.

757
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,729
That's all I want.

758
01:04:02,752 --> 01:04:03,919
What?

759
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:09,043
I'm just wondering

760
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:11,320
why you keep cutting up fruit

761
01:04:11,392 --> 01:04:13,560
when it doesn't ever seem to help.

762
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:18,069
The only thing that doesn't seem to help around here is you .

763
01:04:18,177 --> 01:04:19,778
Why don't you grab a knife and do something,

764
01:04:19,713 --> 01:04:20,846
instead of sitting around,

765
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:23,266
being the poor little kid who can't walk?

766
01:04:25,024 --> 01:04:26,358
Give me a knife.

767
01:04:31,265 --> 01:04:32,532
You know how to use this thing?

768
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:33,908
Of course, I do.

769
01:04:36,288 --> 01:04:37,155
Catch.

770
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:40,336
Tell me how to do my job.

771
01:04:40,448 --> 01:04:41,915
I've been doing this for...

772
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:54,995
Sorry. It just sorta slipped.

773
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:08,672
Sorry. It just sorta slipped.

774
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:12,208
Sure. Pick on the kid with the tumour.

775
01:05:12,224 --> 01:05:14,425
That's really classy.

776
01:05:21,056 --> 01:05:22,090
I'll go first.

777
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:23,174
Okay.

778
01:05:23,777 --> 01:05:25,077
Here goes.

779
01:05:29,056 --> 01:05:30,924
Feels great.

780
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:35,555
Come on. Just let go.

781
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,383
Ready? Come on! One, two, three!

782
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:15,045
Can you see the rainbow?

783
01:06:15,168 --> 01:06:16,168
Yeah.

784
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,446
I wanna say that coming here with you

785
01:06:59,488 --> 01:07:01,990
really kicked me in the ass and I...

786
01:07:03,328 --> 01:07:05,229
and I don't appreciate it.

787
01:07:06,785 --> 01:07:08,319
And you know what, Pete?

788
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,893
Everything I say to other human beings is...

789
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:18,385
pretty much always the wrong thing to say.

790
01:07:19,808 --> 01:07:21,742
But I'm gonna say this:

791
01:07:22,528 --> 01:07:26,331
I don't give a damn what some doctor says.

792
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:32,175
I think you're gonna live.

793
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:45,626
My dad was a great guy.

794
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:50,011
But he wasn't perfect.

795
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:58,696
My mom doesn't like perfect guys.

796
01:08:10,913 --> 01:08:11,979
Come here.

797
01:08:31,937 --> 01:08:33,037
Are you all right?

798
01:08:35,392 --> 01:08:36,192
Pete?

799
01:08:36,352 --> 01:08:38,120
I think I saw something.

800
01:08:41,344 --> 01:08:43,345
Pete. Pete.

801
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,482
Etch that in your mind.

802
01:08:52,449 --> 01:08:55,117
Keep your eye on it.

803
01:09:11,264 --> 01:09:12,331
Okay.

804
01:09:51,617 --> 01:09:52,617
This is it!

805
01:09:52,736 --> 01:09:53,369
Now!

806
01:09:53,504 --> 01:09:54,371
I got it!

807
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,929
Hang on! Hang on!

808
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:04,733
Mr.Osborn.

809
01:10:04,864 --> 01:10:06,298
Just hang on.

810
01:10:06,817 --> 01:10:08,517
There's nothing below us!

811
01:10:11,904 --> 01:10:12,904
Okay.

812
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:18,220
What we have to do is swing,

813
01:10:18,272 --> 01:10:20,540
and then leap to that ledge down there.

814
01:10:23,649 --> 01:10:24,982
Listen.

815
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,655
On the count of three,

816
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:27,752
I'm gonna leap.

817
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:29,639
Hang on with everything you got.

818
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:32,826
One!

819
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,327
On three or right after three?

820
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:35,899
On three.

821
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:38,680
It's breaking.

822
01:10:38,816 --> 01:10:40,617
We have to jump now!

823
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:44,842
Pete!

824
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,736
Damn!

825
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:54,141
Mr. Osborn?

826
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:56,275
It's alright.

827
01:10:59,744 --> 01:11:01,011
I'll pull you up.

828
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,548
Mr. Osborn, he set us up.

829
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,001
Give me your hand.

830
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:17,526
He played with us.

831
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:48,694
Mr. Osborn?

832
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:52,536
Are you okay?

833
01:11:54,497 --> 01:11:55,763
Your leg.

834
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,368
Just give me... Give me a second.

835
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:21,882
Hola, ninos!

836
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:08,328
Okay.

837
01:13:14,529 --> 01:13:15,896
What are you doing?

838
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,900
I'll get help.

839
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:19,793
No, you stay right here.

840
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,341
Come here.

841
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:26,214
You've hurt something inside.

842
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:27,403
Come here!

843
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:29,951
Your leg's broken.

844
01:13:38,304 --> 01:13:39,671
What are you doing?

845
01:13:40,193 --> 01:13:43,161
Don't worry, Mr. Osborn . I'll get help.

846
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,500
No, you come back here.

847
01:13:44,608 --> 01:13:45,408
I can do it.

848
01:13:45,536 --> 01:13:46,369
No.

849
01:13:46,496 --> 01:13:47,996
Listen to me.

850
01:13:48,096 --> 01:13:49,363
You'll get lost in five minutes.

851
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:50,872
I'll be back.

852
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:52,243
Don't worry.

853
01:13:52,864 --> 01:13:54,198
Pete!

854
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:57,472
Please come back.

855
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,974
Pete!

856
01:14:22,112 --> 01:14:23,779
It's all your fault.

857
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,479
We had the same rain the first day, remember?

858
01:16:48,544 --> 01:16:50,345
We got back easily.

859
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:04,396
Let's go.

860
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:12,131
Pete, Pete, I'm here, baby.

861
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,562
Pete, please, remember. Where's Alan, Pete?

862
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,578
Do you remember? How did you get here?

863
01:21:18,656 --> 01:21:21,157
We were at the biggest waterfall around here.

864
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:23,048
We fell down the hole.

865
01:21:23,168 --> 01:21:24,401
You know where he means, right?

866
01:21:24,544 --> 01:21:25,411
Yes.

867
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:26,969
Baby...

868
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,991
It's Mr. Osborn.

869
01:21:32,065 --> 01:21:33,598
How did you get here?

870
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,429
I walked.

871
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,361
You know where he means, right?

872
01:21:38,944 --> 01:21:39,611
I'll take Pete back.

873
01:21:39,745 --> 01:21:41,445
Manolo will go with you. We'll find him.

874
01:21:41,536 --> 01:21:42,102
Go with them.

875
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,546
Yes. Right.

876
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,689
Follow me.

877
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:47,626
Mr. Osborn.

878
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:49,112
Mommy.

879
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:01,275
Is he okay?

880
01:23:03,424 --> 01:23:04,958
- How is he? - He's in bad shape.

881
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,688
We have to leave now.

882
01:23:05,824 --> 01:23:07,758
Manolo will help you with your bags.

883
01:23:09,024 --> 01:23:11,058
- He lost a lot of blood. - Watch it, Pete!

884
01:23:11,136 --> 01:23:13,237
Here. Here. Gently.

885
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:15,694
Okay.

886
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,578
My God!

887
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:24,038
Manolo! Here. Take these!

888
01:23:30,656 --> 01:23:32,958
We didn't catch it but we saw it.

889
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,806
I wouldn't want to catch

890
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:40,413
Don't tell me you wouldn't want to catch one.

891
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:49,061
If I did catch one, he'd be sorry.

892
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,462
If you feel that way, I didn't teach you anything .

893
01:23:59,808 --> 01:24:02,243
It's magic.

894
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,329
Remember.

895
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,316
Manolo. Tenga!

896
01:24:15,872 --> 01:24:17,273
Pete!

897
01:24:18,624 --> 01:24:20,091
Mira.

898
01:24:33,856 --> 01:24:34,555
For me?

899
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,221
It's beautiful.

900
01:24:39,456 --> 01:24:40,789
Pete?

901
01:24:40,896 --> 01:24:43,431
Come on, darling. I'm sorry, we have to go.

902
01:24:51,936 --> 01:24:53,036
Manolo.

903
01:24:53,152 --> 01:24:54,285
Gracias.

904
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,967
De nada.

905
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,162
When Yana gave me the Blue Morpho,

906
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,741
I hardly said "Thank you".

907
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,149
I just didn't know how to show her

908
01:25:06,363 --> 01:25:07,835
how happy I was.

909
01:25:08,096 --> 01:25:10,664
I couldn't believe what she was giving me.

910
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:12,119
It doesn't matter,

911
01:25:12,224 --> 01:25:13,157
because I know she understands

912
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,381
how much it means to me.

913
01:25:21,568 --> 01:25:23,169
My God!

914
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,143
Yana found it.

915
01:27:56,128 --> 01:27:58,563
It's not gonna hurt very much .

916
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,630
Look at you. Just like me.

917
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:10,276
You don't even get mad about it.

918
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,381
I think you're gonna live.

919
01:28:22,976 --> 01:28:25,744
So I knew at last what I had to do.

920
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:27,827
Let him fly away

921
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:30,539
and wait for me to come join him one day.

922
01:28:49,952 --> 01:28:52,020
No one knows why I survived.

923
01:28:52,128 --> 01:28:53,729
Against all odds,

924
01:28:53,856 --> 01:28:56,157
my tumour disappeared.

925
01:28:56,224 --> 01:28:58,559
That's the thing about life!
