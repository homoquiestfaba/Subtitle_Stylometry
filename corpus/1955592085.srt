1
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,762
That memory of going to

2
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:22,832
arlington to bury one of my

3
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:25,034
officers from the c.i.a.,

4
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:28,003
elizabeth hanson, is one that

5
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,573
will be with me for a long time.

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,009
they put their lives on the line

7
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,678
to serve this country, and

8
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,046
that's what elizabeth hanson

9
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,948
did.

10
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:59,099
i knew that the c.i.a. officers

11
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:01,268
were there because i ordered

12
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:03,103
them to be there.

13
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,505
i had to bear some of the

14
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:08,041
responsibility for having taken

15
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,776
this risk.

16
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:13,980
initial reports indicate the

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,315
bomber was being recruited by

18
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:17,016
the c.i.a. as a source.

19
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:18,585
this was the worst, single

20
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:20,653
loss of life for the c.i.a.

21
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:23,689
since 1983, when a truck bomber

22
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:27,426
blew up the american embassy.

23
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:30,095
this person obviously turned

24
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:34,900
out to be a double agent and had

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,135
blown himself up, as well as our

26
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:39,171
officers.

27
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:42,306
it's hard to find the words when

28
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:45,109
suddenly you're told that seven

29
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,510
of your officers have been

30
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,579
killed and others seriously

31
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,947
wounded.

32
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:51,616
what went through my mind was

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,918
the families out there who,

34
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:56,487
within a few hours, were going

35
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:59,757
to be informed that someone

36
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:03,093
who... who they loved had been

37
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:05,729
killed.

38
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:10,100
we spent a lot of time trying to

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,670
figure out who were the ones who

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,273
pushed that button.

41
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,043
we have a lot of sources that we

42
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:25,114
rely on, spies.

43
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,283
and so we immediately asked the

44
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:28,751
question, "who the hell was

45
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:30,819
involved in this tragic suicide

46
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,154
bombing?"

47
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,889
we were able to get pretty good

48
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,158
intelligence.

49
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,930
and so, we knew who the

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,700
individual was.

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,568
this was a bad guy, and he was

52
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,005
clearly a leader.

53
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,507
had been involved not only in

54
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,175
going after our officers, but in

55
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,643
killing members of our own

56
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,878
forces in afghanistan.

57
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:10,957
and it was on the day of

58
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,560
elizabeth hanson's funeral that

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,996
i got a call from our operations

60
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,997
center.

61
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,931
they thought they had pretty

62
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,499
good information about where

63
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,535
this individual was.

64
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,610
unfortunately, this individual

65
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,945
had family and wife and children

66
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:38,783
around him, and so one of the

67
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,353
tough questions was, you know,

68
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,054
"what should we do?"

69
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,022
standby.

70
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,023
do not engage.

71
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,257
do not engage the mosque.

72
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:46,991
roger.

73
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,059
if there were women and

74
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,861
children in the shot, we

75
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,595
normally would not

76
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,429
take the shot.

77
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:53,664
i remember calling the white

78
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:56,567
house, and they were aware how

79
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,236
tough a decision this is and

80
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,437
basically said, "look, you know,

81
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:01,372
you're going to have to make a

82
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:02,373
judgment here."

83
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,975
so i knew at that point that it

84
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,210
was a decision that i was going

85
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,145
to have to make.

86
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,480
i mean, i'm the one who's going

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,049
to have to say hail marys here.

88
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,917
i was raised a catholic, i

89
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,086
believe in my faith, and i rely

90
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,654
a great deal on my faith

91
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:20,390
throughout my life.

92
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,091
i've always carried a rosary and

93
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,627
always said a hell of a lot of

94
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:28,798
hail marys in tough situations.

95
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:31,533
and suddenly, you know, i found

96
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,535
that i was making decisions on

97
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:37,339
life and death as director, and

98
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:41,176
those decisions are never easy,

99
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,544
and frankly they shouldn't be

100
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:44,813
easy.

101
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,683
i felt it was really important

102
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,286
in that job to do what i could

103
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:56,123
to protect this country, so i

104
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:57,124
passed on the word.

105
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:59,126
i said, if you can isolate the

106
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,495
individual and take the shot

107
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,931
without impacting on women or

108
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,299
children, then do it.

109
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,676
but if you have no alternative

110
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,077
and it looks like he might get

111
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:22,816
away, then take the shot.

112
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:23,817
let's go.

113
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:24,883
roll it in.

114
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:25,751
wildfire, we're cleared on the

115
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,787
building.

116
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,723
we're cleared on the big

117
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:32,357
square building.

118
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:33,392
go ahead and level it.

119
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:35,861
roger that.

120
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,434
yeah, direct hits right there.

121
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:43,968
and it did involve collateral

122
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,337
damage, but we got him.

123
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:48,139
it's done.

124
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,474
these are tough decisions,

125
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,641
and you're damn right, they are

126
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,643
tough decisions.

127
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,279
but, you know, this is a war.

128
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,615
this is a war.

129
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,217
9/11, these people didn't

130
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:02,352
hesitate a moment to kill 3,000

131
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:03,420
people and take down the trade

132
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,889
centers and hit the pentagon.

133
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,891
these are individuals that would

134
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:11,194
not hesitate to attack us again.

135
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:16,233
in the end, what you do i think

136
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,469
has to be based on what your

137
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,871
guts tell you is right.

138
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,072
that's really what it's all

139
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,306
about.

140
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:25,708
you have to be true to yourself

141
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,710
as to what you think is right

142
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,212
and hope that ultimately god

143
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:32,781
agrees with you.

144
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:48,897
narrator: inside the c.i.a...

145
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,092
i'm forced to make decisions

146
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:21,661
every day.

147
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:22,495
narrator: director john

148
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:24,397
brennan carries the burden of

149
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:26,265
command.

150
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,900
a lot of decisions that we

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,802
recognize have risks associated

152
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:33,873
with them, significant risks

153
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,740
that sometimes can result in

154
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,877
deaths.

155
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,580
the c.i.a.'s actions a decade

156
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,383
ago are a stain on our value and

157
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,785
on our history.

158
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:48,286
you can't claim that tying

159
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:50,021
someone to the floor and having

160
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,524
them freeze to death is not

161
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:53,791
torture.

162
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,293
torture was what the al qaeda

163
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,094
terrorists did to 3,000

164
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,830
americans on 9/11.

165
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:04,735
i wish the world were

166
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,304
simpler.

167
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,473
i wish we didn't have these

168
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:13,042
complex challenges that we face

169
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,082
where there is not a right and

170
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,483
wrong answer, where it's not

171
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:23,319
black and white.

172
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,587
on those days when i'm thinking

173
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,622
about the things that worry me

174
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:29,258
most, there is the biological

175
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,160
agent, there is the devastating

176
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,362
strategic type of terrorist

177
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,964
attack, because we know that

178
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,399
these individuals are so

179
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,634
determined to cause as much

180
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,402
havoc and destruction and death

181
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:42,571
as possible.

182
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,510
how do you deal with this

183
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,077
phenomenon that we're facing as

184
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:58,219
far as terrorism, like isis and

185
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:07,961
their wanton, murderous

186
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,597
activities?

187
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:18,471
isis rules with brutality and

188
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,440
fear, publicly executing those

189
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,375
who offend its strict version of

190
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,378
islamic law.

191
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,149
well, we can let these

192
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:30,949
terrorist organitions thrive

193
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,251
and not take action against

194
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:38,123
them, or we can try to take

195
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,458
action that's going to disrupt

196
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,960
their plans.

197
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:44,962
narrator: in a conflict

198
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,467
against a ruthless enemy, what

199
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,035
are the rules for america's

200
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,704
spymasters?

201
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:54,138
go for the vehicle.

202
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,840
you are now free to engage the

203
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,341
moving vehicle.

204
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:58,509
narrator: does the c.i.a. go

205
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,111
too far...

206
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:04,948
(unintelligible commands)

207
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:05,716
narrator: ...or not far

208
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:08,819
enough?

209
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:09,953
killing people, no matter how

210
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:12,289
bad they are, is not something

211
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,657
that should ever rest easily in

212
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,092
anybody's soul or in anybody's

213
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,326
brain.

214
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:17,761
sometimes i think we get

215
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:20,197
ourselves into a frenzy, into

216
00:10:20,197 --> 00:10:21,697
believing that killing is the

217
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,699
only answer to a problem.

218
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,935
and the truth is, it's not.

219
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,475
narrator: only 12 men alive

220
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,143
today have made the

221
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,178
life-and-death decisions that

222
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,047
come with running the world's

223
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:39,715
most powerful intelligence

224
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:40,548
agency.

225
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:41,816
let me bare my soul just a

226
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:44,085
little bit more.

227
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:44,953
narrator: the keepers of

228
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:50,225
america's secrets,

229
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:56,264
the spymasters and their top

230
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,766
operatives share their

231
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:59,900
convictions and, for the first

232
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,468
time, their passionate

233
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:02,569
disagreements, about the

234
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:04,805
agency's past, its current

235
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,374
mission and its future.

236
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:09,777
it is a battle for the soul of

237
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,880
the c.i.a.

238
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,515
when you're confronting an

239
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,150
enemy that's prepared to blow up

240
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,019
and kill innocent men, women and

241
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,790
children, you have to go at them

242
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,058
using the capabilities that we

243
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,160
have.

244
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,896
for me, that's the basic rule:

245
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,031
do we protect our people or do

246
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:34,167
we not protect them?

247
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:42,407
narrator: did the white house

248
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:45,744
ignore the c.i.a.'s warnings

249
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:48,380
about 911?

250
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,148
3,000 americans had been

251
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:52,184
killed.

252
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,618
there was an emotional piece of

253
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,753
this because we had woken up

254
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:59,123
every day of our lives trying to

255
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:02,226
stop what just had happened.

256
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,200
narrator: what's fair game

257
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,569
against terrorists hell-bent on

258
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,137
attacking us again?

259
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,005
black sites, indefinite

260
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,541
detention?

261
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,909
you're director of central

262
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,511
intelligence and somebody comes

263
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:22,745
forward and says to you, "we got

264
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,547
these bad guys, we know they're

265
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:25,748
bad guys.

266
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:26,749
what would you like us to do

267
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:27,717
with them?"

268
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,853
well, the old traditional way

269
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:30,887
would have been to put them in

270
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,054
the back of the truck and shoot

271
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:32,888
them.

272
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:33,956
well, that's not a very good

273
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,824
idea, is it?

274
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:36,558
narrator: are brutal

275
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:39,561
interrogation techniques ever

276
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:40,796
acceptable?

277
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:41,697
the senate report has

278
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:43,232
publicly revealed graphic new

279
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:43,799
details.

280
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,033
...and the report says

281
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,768
detainees were kept in total

282
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,871
darkness, shackled to the wall

283
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,772
in 45-degree temperatures.

284
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,474
we were asked to do some very

285
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:54,709
hard things.

286
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:55,376
are we happy we did them?

287
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,277
of course not.

288
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,478
would we do them again?

289
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,312
i would hope so if we found

290
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,080
ourselves in those

291
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,750
circumstances.

292
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,219
i just don't think a country

293
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:09,289
like ours should be culpable of

294
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,691
conducting torture.

295
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,995
i just think it's beneath our

296
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,062
dignity.

297
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,964
i think it's poor for our

298
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,369
reputation and the world.

299
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,603
i'm not going to ever accept

300
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,038
the use of the word "torture" in

301
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,972
front of what happened here.

302
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:31,110
i'm not going to fall to that.

303
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,378
narrator: has the c.i.a.

304
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,080
become a secret army, a killing

305
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,317
machine?

306
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,184
you're sitting there in the

307
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,387
middle of nowhere in nevada, and

308
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,622
you're looking at a screen that

309
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,057
is televising what looks for all

310
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:48,326
the world like a big video game.

311
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,062
and push a button and a pickup

312
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,031
truck explodes half a world

313
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:57,101
away.

314
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,536
i mean, if they're bad guys

315
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:00,405
and they're doing us harm,

316
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:02,774
i have no problem with that.

317
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:07,244
now the dark side.

318
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:08,845
you know, you can't be perfect.

319
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,114
there is collateral damage.

320
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:13,717
(crying)

321
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:29,265
we feed the jihadi

322
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:32,201
recruitment video that these

323
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:36,939
americans are heartless killers.

324
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:39,542
we may have to use these

325
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,577
kinds of weapons, but, in the

326
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,912
end, let me tell you

327
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:46,948
something--if we fail to do this

328
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:49,751
and god forbid this country

329
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:53,121
faced another 9/11, you know

330
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,255
what the first question would

331
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,458
be: why the hell did you let

332
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,959
this happen?

333
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,593
why the hell did you let this

334
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:01,595
happen?

335
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:17,711
if you are a terrorism

336
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,050
analyst for long enough, you

337
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,019
will have many moments where you

338
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,757
will feel responsible.

339
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:32,992
responsible for not having

340
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,927
stayed long enough, not having

341
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,762
stayed late enough, not having

342
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,330
thought hard enough.

343
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,332
not having plowed through enough

344
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:43,368
data to connect those proverbial

345
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:44,436
dots.

346
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:46,772
and you'll see on the other end

347
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:49,374
of that individuals who are hurt

348
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:52,444
or killed.

349
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,816
i gave birth to my first son in

350
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,418
what was a very emergency

351
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,118
c-section.

352
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:03,287
he was quite early.

353
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,556
i was lying down in my hospital

354
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:06,257
bed, still trying to get over

355
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,859
some of the pain.

356
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:11,362
my phone rang, and i heard my

357
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:13,030
boss screaming on the other end,

358
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,297
"your people did this, your

359
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,266
people did this."

360
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,400
and i had no idea what she was

361
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,102
talking about, but i knew she

362
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,136
meant something bad had

363
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:23,540
happened.

364
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,675
and i turned on the television,

365
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:27,644
and i saw, and i knew what she

366
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:28,545
meant.

367
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:31,181
narrator: february 26, 1993.

368
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:32,347
we heard a tremendous

369
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:33,382
explosion.

370
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:34,249
the entire building.

371
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:34,950
narrator: in an underground

372
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,419
garage in new york city, a van

373
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,655
packed with explosives

374
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:43,058
detonates, killing six people

375
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,426
and injuring more than a

376
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:45,828
thousand.

377
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,963
it would be the first attack on

378
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,164
the world trade center.

379
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:50,265
the fact is, at this hour,

380
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:52,066
police simply don't know who did

381
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:56,037
this or why.

382
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,405
the big message that comes

383
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,674
out of the 1993 trade center

384
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:02,910
bombing is that a threshold has

385
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,845
been crossed.

386
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,847
they've hit us here.

387
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,782
but you know, thinking back on

388
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,783
it, i'm not sure that message

389
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,751
was as powerfully absorbed as we

390
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:14,588
can see it in retrospect.

391
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:15,322
narrator: the trail would

392
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:16,857
lead to a shadowy network of

393
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,892
jihadists in afghanistan that

394
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,660
the world would come to know as

395
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,562
al qaeda, and a charismatic

396
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:24,564
saudi multi-millionaire.

397
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:26,633
i had likened osama bin laden

398
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,968
at the time to-- i know this is

399
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,369
horrible to say, but to donald

400
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:31,604
trump.

401
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:32,605
you know, he was like the donald

402
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:33,606
trump of the terrorism

403
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:34,273
underworld.

404
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:36,342
he had the wherewithal and a

405
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:37,643
vision that was clearly

406
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:38,811
controversial and different from

407
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,179
everybody else, but, you know,

408
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,914
the tenacity to follow it.

409
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,649
i definitely drew a lot of

410
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,484
snickers from my... from my

411
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:46,985
colleagues who thought i was

412
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:48,186
making a mountain out of a

413
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:49,787
molehill and blowing him out of

414
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:52,257
proportion.

415
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:56,494
narrator: august 7, 1998.

416
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,630
suicide truck bombers strike

417
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,865
american embassies in tanzania

418
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:04,202
and kenya, east africa.

419
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:08,005
224 people lie dead, two of them

420
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,141
c.i.a. officers.

421
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,276
after the east africa

422
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:13,911
bombings, i sat at home and

423
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,913
furiously drafted a memo called

424
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:18,282
"we're at war."

425
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:20,584
enough swatting at flies; we

426
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:21,885
need to put a worldwide plan in

427
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:24,086
place where we can start

428
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,988
demonstrating that we can

429
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,423
penetrate this adversary, get

430
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:28,958
into the sanctuary, penetrate

431
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,160
his major operational hubs and

432
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,429
set us up for really providing

433
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:34,964
policymakers with hard

434
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,432
intelligence with which they

435
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,769
could make decisions.

436
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,406
narrator: cofer black, a

437
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,608
legendary operative, had escaped

438
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,343
an assassination attempt by al

439
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:53,848
qaeda while serving in khartoum.

440
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:55,083
the first week that i was in

441
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,518
the counterterrorism center, new

442
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,820
chief comes in, and they stick

443
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,055
you in a conference room, and

444
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,789
people start coming in and

445
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:02,923
briefing you on all their areas

446
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:04,792
of activity.

447
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,093
i don't shock easy, but i was

448
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,328
shocked.

449
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:09,063
this was a wave of threats

450
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:10,931
coming at the united states.

451
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:13,234
there was no doubt in my mind

452
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,369
that the united states was going

453
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,171
to be struck and struck hard.

454
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:18,339
lots of americans were going to

455
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:21,674
die.

456
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:22,976
sandy berger, the national

457
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,444
security advisor at the end of

458
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:25,478
the clinton administration,

459
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:26,846
asked us for a very important

460
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,181
piece of paper.

461
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,415
we called it the "blue sky

462
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,017
paper."

463
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:34,053
he said, "i want you to imagine

464
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,321
that you had all the authorities

465
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,689
you needed and all the resources

466
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:38,790
you needed to take down al

467
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,124
qaeda.

468
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:40,525
what would you do?"

469
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,994
getting into the afghan

470
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:42,995
sanctuary, launching a

471
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,730
paramilitary operation-- we knew

472
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,498
exactly what to do.

473
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,166
we were ready to do it.

474
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,136
the important part is, no

475
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,771
action was taken.

476
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:55,941
it was not advanced.

477
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,108
narrator: as al qaeda grows

478
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,143
more lethal, c.i.a. director

479
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,245
george tenet faces a test that

480
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,880
will define his place in

481
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,850
history: can the c.i.a. stop bin

482
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,586
laden before he strikes the

483
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:13,858
united states again?

484
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,393
on september 28, 2000, we

485
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,428
were testing drones over

486
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,797
afghanistan when we saw a very

487
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:24,834
tall man in white robes who we

488
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,437
assumed at the time was bin

489
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:32,042
laden.

490
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,076
i mean, i love this.

491
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:36,078
this is such a washington thing.

492
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:38,380
our instructions were to capture

493
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,448
him, and that's what we

494
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,016
attempted to do.

495
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:41,917
and the difference between

496
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,019
capturing, i would think, and

497
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,221
the alternative is significant.

498
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:47,856
and the gap is large.

499
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:49,491
killing bin laden in the time

500
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,260
period we operated was never an

501
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,094
option because the attorney

502
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:54,562
general of the united states

503
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:57,665
could only be killed in theat he

504
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:00,101
context of a capture operation.

505
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:01,669
did you tell the white house,

506
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:05,373
did you tell janet reno, "look,

507
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:07,208
you don't get it.

508
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,676
we have to kill this guy.

509
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:10,278
we have to take him down"?

510
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:11,411
no.

511
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,979
i'll tell you why.

512
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,448
i have an institutional

513
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,516
responsibility; i play in a

514
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:17,751
process where the president of

515
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:18,952
the united states and the

516
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,520
attorney general have to accept

517
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,922
responsibility for the actions

518
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:26,360
we're going to take.

519
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,427
narrator: but the east africa

520
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:29,929
bombings in 1998 had changed the

521
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,263
calculus for president bill

522
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,366
clinton.

523
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,800
he launched cruise missile

524
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,369
strikes in an effort to kill bin

525
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,905
laden, but they missed.

526
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:41,640
the clinton administration

527
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,809
spent eight years learning to

528
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,811
appreciate this threat, and only

529
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:48,580
at the very end did they get it.

530
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,914
i, george walker bush, do

531
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,483
solemnly swear that i will

532
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:52,584
faithfully execute the office of

533
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,387
president of the united states.

534
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:57,155
there's no doubt that

535
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:58,556
policymakers across two

536
00:21:58,556 --> 00:22:00,191
administrations understood from

537
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:03,194
me, and understood from cofer

538
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:04,362
and all of our analysts and

539
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:05,630
people who briefed them,

540
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,864
understood the magnitude of the

541
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:10,033
threat in front of them.

542
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,572
in the spring of 2001, we

543
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:17,441
submitted authorities to the

544
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,109
incoming bush administration and

545
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,677
essentially advocating a

546
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,613
paramilitary operation.

547
00:22:22,613 --> 00:22:25,615
and the word back was, "we're

548
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:27,083
not quite ready to consider this

549
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,118
we don't want the clock to start

550
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:31,821
ticking."

551
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:33,756
what did that mean to you?

552
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:34,991
that the administration was

553
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:36,859
not quite ready to consider what

554
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,227
its options were with regard to

555
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:39,729
terrorism.

556
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:41,164
i think they were mentally

557
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:42,899
stuck back eight years ago.

558
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:44,232
when they were in power, they

559
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:45,400
were used to terrorists being

560
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,802
euro lefties-- drink champagne

561
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:48,103
by night, blow things up during

562
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:50,305
the day-- and it was a very

563
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,908
difficult sell to communicate

564
00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:55,010
the urgency to this.

565
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:05,419
for us, the system was

566
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,887
blinking red in the sense that

567
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:07,721
we thought what we were

568
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,991
uncovering was a top-down plot,

569
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,326
something being ordered from

570
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,395
afghanistan out.

571
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:15,896
but it was very difficult for us

572
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,300
to figure out what it was.

573
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,533
narrator: the crisis comes to

574
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,870
a head on july 10, 2001.

575
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,004
richard blee, the head of the

576
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,940
bin laden unit, barges into

577
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,975
cofer black's office.

578
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,310
he comes and he goes, "okay,

579
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,511
roof's fallen in."

580
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,079
i said, "great, what'cha got?"

581
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,614
the information that we had now

582
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,648
compiled was absolutely

583
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,150
compelling.

584
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,884
it was multiple-sourced, and it

585
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,486
was... it was sort of the last

586
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,587
straw.

587
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,888
picked up the phone, called the

588
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,022
secretary, "have to see the

589
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:44,957
director, i'm coming up with

590
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:45,724
rich."

591
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,292
she says, "well, i'm sorry, he's

592
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,261
in with the head of some foreign

593
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,596
intelligence service."

594
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,698
i said, "we're coming up.

595
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:53,665
kick the guy out.

596
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,500
we're coming now.

597
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,768
tell him to get ready."

598
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,505
george tenet is a very smart

599
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,873
guy.

600
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,041
chewing on his cigar, going back

601
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,409
and forth, jumping up and down.

602
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,811
his eyes are flashing.

603
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,613
wish i had a film of it.

604
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,114
he got it, all right.

605
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,782
it's not just red lights.

606
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:14,085
red lights and chatter is a

607
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,253
convenient way this is

608
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:15,986
portrayed.

609
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,354
there were real plots being

610
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:18,655
manifested.

611
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:19,856
the american embassy in sana'a

612
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,024
is going to be bombed, british

613
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,392
and american schools in jeddah

614
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:23,293
are going to be bombed.

615
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:24,661
the world was on the edge of

616
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,797
eruption.

617
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:31,101
[parent explosion]

618
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:32,702
now, what happens then in this

619
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:34,770
period of time in june and july,

620
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,806
the threat continues to rise.

621
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:39,642
public pronouncements by people

622
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:41,477
in al qaeda was, there would be

623
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,479
eight major celebrations coming.

624
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,880
the world was going to be

625
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,848
stunned by what would soon

626
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,049
happen.

627
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,817
terrorists were disappearing.

628
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,419
camps were closing.

629
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,321
threat reporting on the rise.

630
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:53,855
and this started building to a

631
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:54,923
crescendo.

632
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:56,357
we decided the next thing to

633
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,559
do was pick up the white phone,

634
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,726
call the white house, "we're

635
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:00,028
coming down right now."

636
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,229
i said, "condi, i have to

637
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:02,564
come see you."

638
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:03,898
it was one of the rare times in

639
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:05,266
my seven years as director where

640
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:06,868
i said, "i have to come see you.

641
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:11,239
we're coming right now."

642
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,472
narrator: present at the july

643
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,241
10 white house meeting are

644
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,742
national security advisor

645
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,644
condoleezza rice and other top

646
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:19,346
officials.

647
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:21,448
so rich started by saying,

648
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:22,649
"there will be significant

649
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,984
terrorist attacks against the

650
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:25,185
united states in the coming

651
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:26,687
weeks or months.

652
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:28,689
the attacks will be spectacular.

653
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:30,189
they may be multiple.

654
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:31,457
al qaeda's intention is the

655
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:32,692
destruction of the united

656
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:35,027
states."

657
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:36,362
and i said, "this country's

658
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:39,131
got to go a war footing now."

659
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:42,535
i slammed my hand on the table.

660
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:44,804
after it was over, rich blee and

661
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:46,839
i sort of congratulated each

662
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,507
other in the sense that, "i

663
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,675
think we finally got through to

664
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,377
these people.

665
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,145
we have executed our

666
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:54,879
responsibilities."

667
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:56,514
what happened?

668
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,349
yeah.

669
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,184
what did happen?

670
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,051
yeah.

671
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,086
what happened?

672
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:02,187
essentially, nothing

673
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,922
happened?

674
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:05,991
yeah, that's right.

675
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:07,124
narrator: condoleezza rice

676
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,459
would later write that her

677
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:10,227
memory of the meeting was "not

678
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,262
very crisp because we were

679
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,664
discussing the threat every

680
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:14,932
day."

681
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,200
having raised the alert levels

682
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,968
for u.s. personnel abroad, she

683
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:19,903
added, "i thought we were doing

684
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:23,841
what needed to be done."

685
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:36,419
if on the 10th of september

686
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:37,920
we'd been able to walk into the

687
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,322
president of the united states

688
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:41,924
and say, "we think u.s.

689
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:43,259
airliners are going to be

690
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:44,960
hijacked tomorrow," just think

691
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,195
about it.

692
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:47,929
if we had been able to give him

693
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:51,333
that very specific piece, as the

694
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,735
president, he may very well have

695
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:55,570
held all the airliners from

696
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,775
flying, until when?

697
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:15,756
we might have stopped 9/11 from

698
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:19,126
happening on 9/11, but i think

699
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:20,327
it would've happened on the 10th

700
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:21,928
of october or the 12th of

701
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:24,297
november.

702
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:25,932
if you don't put a system of

703
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:28,001
defense in place, if you don't

704
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,869
button up your airports, button

705
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:31,571
up your buildings, change your

706
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,239
visa policies, have some

707
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,607
knowledge about what's going on

708
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:36,609
in the united states, create a

709
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:38,044
mechanism where there's a...

710
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:40,212
where there's a quick swivel

711
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,314
between foreign and domestic,

712
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:45,918
you're going to get hurt.

713
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,490
you know what really does

714
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,392
piss me off?

715
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:54,927
when people call this an

716
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:56,829
intelligence failure.

717
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:58,830
we knew this was coming,

718
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,931
american interests are going to

719
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,299
be attacked, and it could very

720
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,334
well be in the united states.

721
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:07,305
it's serious, it's coming.

722
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:08,773
sometimes when i drive my car i

723
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,475
think about it, and to me it

724
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:12,677
remains incomprehensible still.

725
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:15,646
i mean, how is it that you could

726
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:19,783
warn senior people so many times

727
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,419
and nothing actually happened?

728
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,588
it's kind of like the "twilight

729
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:25,689
zone."

730
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:26,857
you almost sometimes feel like

731
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:29,359
you want to pinch yourself.

732
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,194
at the end of july, we were

733
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:33,196
sitting in my conference room

734
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:34,631
just thinking about all of this

735
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,233
and trying to figure out how

736
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:41,203
this attack might occur, and

737
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,638
i'll never forget this till the

738
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,473
day i die.

739
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,442
rich blee looked at everybody

740
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:49,912
and said, "they're coming here."

741
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:51,981
and the silence that followed

742
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:52,715
was deafening.

743
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:55,650
you could hear a pin drop.

744
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,256
"they're coming here."

745
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:17,371
the head of my security

746
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:38,825
detail came over to me to say a

747
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,359
plane had hit one of the towers

748
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,562
of the world trade center.

749
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:44,263
my instinctual reaction was,

750
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:44,897
"this is al qaeda.

751
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:46,732
i've got to go."

752
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,334
there are fire crews just

753
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:49,968
streaming into this area from

754
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:54,706
every conceivable direction.

755
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:56,041
and we all looked around and

756
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,043
we thought, "oh, my goodness.

757
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,478
tragic accident."

758
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:01,913
and people were talking about

759
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,348
a private aircraft had flown

760
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:06,451
into... into the tower.

761
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:07,385
i thought, "geez, this must

762
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:10,154
be the world's worst pilot."

763
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:11,522
i jumped in the car.

764
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:12,356
it was the world's longest

765
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:13,190
car ride.

766
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,225
it took 12 minutes, but the

767
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:17,127
phones weren't working.

768
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:21,398
looking up at the tv, in real

769
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,001
time we saw the second plane hit

770
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:27,136
the other tower.

771
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:32,709
we knew, we all knew, "we're

772
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:35,845
under attack."

773
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:36,946
holy shit, the first one we

774
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:38,047
thought was an accident.

775
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:39,148
when we heard there was a second

776
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:40,149
one, we definitely thought it

777
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:41,384
was terrorism.

778
00:30:41,384 --> 00:30:42,252
and i heard a roar, and i

779
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:43,286
looked up and saw the second

780
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,220
plane hit.

781
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,687
people were crying, holding

782
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:48,523
on to each other.

783
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:59,334
stay calm.

784
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,669
stay calm, stay calm.

785
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:01,503
please, god.

786
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:02,537
you're doing a good job.

787
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:03,639
and somebody said, "my god,

788
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:04,672
they hit the pentagon, they hit

789
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:05,873
the pentagon."

790
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:06,807
ladies and gentlemen, let's

791
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:07,875
keep move... away from the

792
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,677
building.

793
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:10,645
let's get away from the

794
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:13,381
building, ladies and gentlemen.

795
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,519
so director tenet said, "okay

796
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,820
we have to evacuate

797
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,355
headquarters."

798
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:24,824
everybody out, everybody out.

799
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:28,261
if they stay, they could die.

800
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,430
i said, "we're needed.

801
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,598
that's where our computers are.

802
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,099
we need to respond.

803
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,234
if that's the case, then we'll

804
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:37,337
just have to die."

805
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:38,805
narrator: that day, michael

806
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:40,806
morell, the president's briefer,

807
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:42,274
is with george w. bush in

808
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:43,943
florida.

809
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,445
it was our job to prevent an

810
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:48,614
attack, and we didn't do it.

811
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:52,685
on our watch, this happened.

812
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:54,353
we went back to "air force one."

813
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:57,122
there was a ring of secret

814
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:58,090
service agents around "air force

815
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,094
one" with automatic weapons.

816
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,195
we took off.

817
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:06,197
we went up at a very steep

818
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:09,100
ascent.

819
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,368
and i remember saying to the

820
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,370
president's military aide,

821
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,471
"where are we going?"

822
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,672
he said, "we're just going to be

823
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:15,940
flying around for a bit until we

824
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,742
figure out what's going on."

825
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,243
we were watching television

826
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:22,612
images from new york, and it was

827
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:24,815
in there that we saw the two

828
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:28,051
towers collapse.

829
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:28,618
wait a second.

830
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:29,820
is this a live picture?

831
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,854
this is a live picture.

832
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:33,156
we're seeing the second world

833
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:34,858
trade tower center.

834
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:36,426
the second world trade center

835
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:39,495
has just collapsed --

836
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:48,104
today, our fellow citizens,

837
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:50,406
way of life, our very freedom

838
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:53,075
came under attack in a series of

839
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:55,343
deliberate and deadly terrorist

840
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:56,711
acts.

841
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:59,414
the victims were in airplanes--

842
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,915
the city i grew up in had been

843
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:02,083
blown up.

844
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:03,451
secretaries, businessmen and

845
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,053
women, military and federal,--

846
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:09,290
neighbors.

847
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,267
nobody comes to our town and

848
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:24,204
messes with our people.

849
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:25,572
in his office on "air force

850
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:28,075
one," the president said to me,

851
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:32,612
"michael, who did this?"

852
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,514
and i said, "mr. president, both

853
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,983
iran and iraq have absolutely

854
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:38,751
nothing to gain and have

855
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,286
everything to lose from doing

856
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:43,990
this.

857
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,226
i would bet my children's future

858
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,695
that this is al qaeda.

859
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:53,031
this is bin laden."

860
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,166
and certainly, looking at the

861
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,667
flight manifests, that

862
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,102
corroborated the fact that it

863
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,237
had been al qaeda.

864
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,372
narrator: it takes only

865
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,973
moments to discover what has

866
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,909
been years in the making.

867
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,410
there, in black and white, on

868
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,812
the passenger manifest of the

869
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:08,747
plane that hit the pentagon are

870
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,881
known al qaeda terrorists--

871
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,651
nawaf al hazmi and khalid al

872
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,186
midhar.

873
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,720
two of the hijackers on board

874
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,222
the airliner which attacked the

875
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,690
pentagon had been identified

876
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,192
more than a year and a half

877
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,928
before as suspected terrorists,

878
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,629
yet nothing was done to stop

879
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,964
al-hazmi and al-midhar from

880
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,799
entering the u.s, and no

881
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:31,201
attempt was made to find them

882
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,902
until just three weeks before

883
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:35,338
september 11.

884
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,107
why didn't the c.i.a., why

885
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:38,274
didn't somebody pick up the

886
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:40,076
phone to the f.b.i. and say,

887
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:42,979
"hey, these two guys are here?"

888
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:44,614
at root here is, we didn't

889
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:46,949
have the seamless interaction.

890
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,450
we didn't have the ability to

891
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,818
fuse things quickly.

892
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,687
our policies were out of date.

893
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:53,021
the information that the

894
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,857
c.i.a. had about the two

895
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,258
hijackers in the united states

896
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,659
should have been routinely

897
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,894
shared with the f.b.i., and it

898
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,829
wasn't.

899
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:01,730
narrator: two government

900
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,832
agencies charged with protecting

901
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:06,601
the united states were barely

902
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:07,902
communicating.

903
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:08,836
intelligence officials

904
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:10,671
acknowledge both the c.i.a. and

905
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:13,040
f.b.i. failed to follow up on

906
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,575
leads that could have pointed

907
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:16,277
them in the direction of the

908
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:17,979
9/11 hijackers.

909
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:20,148
in essence, al qaeda being a

910
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,583
smart intelligence organization,

911
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,918
looked at our banking policies,

912
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:27,320
our border policies, our airline

913
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,722
protection policies, our

914
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:30,490
infrastructure policies and came

915
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,259
to a conclusion that the country

916
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:38,632
was absolutely unprotected.

917
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:39,933
i think there's huge failures

918
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:41,401
at the c.i.a. and the f.b.i.

919
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,968
the c.i.a. missed the chance

920
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:44,470
to nab two suspects after they

921
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,604
entered the united states.

922
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:46,872
our government failed to

923
00:35:46,872 --> 00:35:51,043
protect the american people.

924
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,882
an elected official came up

925
00:35:56,882 --> 00:35:59,051
to me and said, "so, cofer, how

926
00:35:59,051 --> 00:36:00,485
does it feel to be responsible

927
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:02,320
for the largest intelligence

928
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,390
failure since pearl harbor?"

929
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,092
this was a failure of policy,

930
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:11,229
management, capability, and,

931
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:13,298
above all, a failure of

932
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,933
imagination.

933
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,734
none of the measures adopted by

934
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:17,835
the united states government

935
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:20,804
before 9/11 disturbed or even

936
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,106
delayed the progress of the al

937
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:26,343
qaeda plot.

938
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,549
above all else, 9/11 was a

939
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,284
failure of our imagination.

940
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:35,752
we all knew something was going

941
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:37,720
to happen; we just found it

942
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,423
very, very hard to conceive that

943
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:42,925
what happened on that day was

944
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:45,895
going to happen.

945
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:47,330
i've never liked this

946
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,831
"failure of imagination" thing.

947
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,000
i think 9/11 is a national

948
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,068
failure.

949
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:54,170
it actually took 9/11 for the

950
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,738
american people to get to the

951
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:57,806
point where they would agree

952
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,174
with all the defensive measures

953
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:03,478
that needed to be put in place.

954
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,584
there was never a moment in

955
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,820
all of this time when you blamed

956
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,557
yourself?

957
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:20,494
well, look, there... i'm... i

958
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:21,829
still look at the ceiling at

959
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:23,430
night about a lot of things--

960
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,765
and i'll keep them to myself

961
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:29,303
forever-- but we're all human

962
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:33,606
beings.

963
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:39,145
i do remember the whole

964
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:43,283
emotional impact of 9/11 struck

965
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:47,287
me very hard as i sat on my

966
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:48,988
front lawn after thanksgiving

967
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:52,090
one day.

968
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,525
the horror of what happened hit

969
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:54,459
me.

970
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:57,229
there was no time between 9/11

971
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:58,897
and that moment.

972
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:01,700
i just didn't have any time.

973
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,502
narrator: no time, because

974
00:38:03,502 --> 00:38:04,903
the c.i.a. would now be called

975
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,571
upon to put its war plan against

976
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:09,308
al qaeda into action, that

977
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:11,742
audacious "blue sky" memo that

978
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:15,813
had been ignored before 9/11.

979
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:17,448
on september the 15th, we

980
00:38:17,448 --> 00:38:19,483
essentially outline our plan--

981
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:21,419
seal the borders of afghanistan,

982
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:22,820
go after their leadership, shut

983
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,121
off their money, destroy al

984
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:25,189
qaeda.

985
00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:27,792
we're saying, "take our plan.

986
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,793
let us go first."

987
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:32,262
and i said, "mr. president, when

988
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:35,198
we're done, these guys are going

989
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:36,466
to have flies walking across

990
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:38,201
their eyeballs."

991
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:39,402
and i could see the president

992
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,537
was thinking, "wait, flies on

993
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:41,905
eyeballs..."

994
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,173
then he got it.

995
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:44,641
and he says, "we'll use the

996
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:45,975
c.i.a. plan.

997
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,509
c.i.a. will be first boots on

998
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,511
the ground."

999
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,013
narrator: 110 c.i.a. officers

1000
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:53,082
and 300 special forces sweep

1001
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:55,584
into the tribal areas...

1002
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,986
niner four five over.

1003
00:38:57,986 --> 00:38:59,421
copy that.

1004
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,622
narrator: ...where they will

1005
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:01,857
join with warriors of the

1006
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:06,060
northern alliance and uproot the

1007
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,062
taliban and al qaeda from their

1008
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:10,965
safe hold in afghanistan.

1009
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,300
(unintelligible

1010
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,303
communication)

1011
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:16,270
narrator: the c.i.a.'s

1012
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,539
message: if you are with us,

1013
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:20,908
you'll be rewarded...

1014
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,410
our officers often slept on

1015
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,511
millions of dollars of cash at

1016
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:25,712
night.

1017
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:26,947
narrator: ...but if you are

1018
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,951
against us...

1019
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,018
you were more than likely to

1020
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:34,020
get a 2,000-pound bomb down your

1021
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,422
throat.

1022
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:36,723
there was never a general on the

1023
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:38,258
ground.

1024
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,059
there was never a command

1025
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:40,694
structure on the ground.

1026
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:41,795
this was a real

1027
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,129
counterinsurgency.

1028
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:44,697
[gunshots]

1029
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:46,365
we've got the airplane on

1030
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:47,466
that target first.

1031
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:50,369
over.

1032
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,004
we're not seeing any taliban

1033
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:53,072
at this time.

1034
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:54,273
over.

1035
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:55,808
in about nine weeks, all

1036
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:57,309
cities controlled by the taliban

1037
00:39:57,309 --> 00:40:00,613
had been overthrown.

1038
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:02,247
all al qaeda in afghanistan had

1039
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:04,949
either been killed, captured,

1040
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,217
were running for the border, or

1041
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:09,754
crossed the border.

1042
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:10,955
narrator: bin laden's

1043
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,323
sanctuary, tora bora, is blown

1044
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,993
to pieces, but the c.i.a.'s

1045
00:40:14,993 --> 00:40:17,662
lightning victory is fleeting

1046
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:18,930
because the terrorist leader

1047
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,032
crosses the border into pakistan

1048
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:24,701
and disappears.

1049
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:26,804
i'm not sure i ever saw the

1050
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,305
president get mad except this

1051
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:30,874
one occasion, and he was

1052
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:32,743
furious.

1053
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:33,977
narrator: and now the

1054
00:40:33,977 --> 00:40:35,779
agency's finest hour is about to

1055
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,080
be followed by one of its

1056
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,416
darkest chapters, because the

1057
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:41,851
white house is eyeing another

1058
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:46,956
target: iraq.

1059
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:49,459
there is no doubt that saddam

1060
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:51,828
hussein now has weapons of mass

1061
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,463
destruction, and he had

1062
00:40:53,463 --> 00:40:54,697
established relationship with al

1063
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:56,065
qaeda.

1064
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:57,566
there was a relationship between

1065
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:59,601
al qaeda and iraq that stretched

1066
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:02,370
back ten years.

1067
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,538
that's not something i thought

1068
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:05,106
of, that's what the director of

1069
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:07,242
central intelligence was telling

1070
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:08,109
us.

1071
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:09,511
this connection did not

1072
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:10,545
exist.

1073
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:11,947
we intervened on numerous

1074
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:13,114
occasions to say so.

1075
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:14,616
everybody knew what our point of

1076
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:16,250
view was.

1077
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,852
and i remember once going to the

1078
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:19,186
president and saying, "look,

1079
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,387
we... this has got to stop.

1080
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:22,122
we can't support this language."

1081
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:23,591
neither c.i.a. nor any other

1082
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:25,259
government agency ever found any

1083
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:27,161
evidence that iraq played any

1084
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,129
role at all in 9/11.

1085
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:30,364
we stuck with that view

1086
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,966
that saddam was not involved in

1087
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:34,201
9.11.

1088
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,468
narrator: but on the central

1089
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,704
question, does saddam hussein

1090
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:38,838
have weapons of mass

1091
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:41,040
destruction?, the c.i.a.'s

1092
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,077
answer is yes.

1093
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:45,445
in the oval office, director

1094
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,614
tenet reassures george w. bush

1095
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:49,482
with a metaphor that becomes

1096
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:51,017
infamous.

1097
00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:53,318
i said, "we can make this

1098
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:53,986
better.

1099
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:54,987
it's a slam dunk."

1100
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:55,888
it was tenet who assured

1101
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,256
president bush the question of

1102
00:41:57,256 --> 00:41:58,757
iraq having weapons of mass

1103
00:41:58,757 --> 00:42:00,926
destruction was a slam dunk.

1104
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:04,630
a "slam dunk."

1105
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,798
now, the way it was portrayed

1106
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:08,901
was, this was the seminal moment

1107
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,369
in the president's life in terms

1108
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,004
of deciding whether to go to war

1109
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:14,405
or not, and that's not what

1110
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:16,607
happened at all.

1111
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:18,976
the decision to go to war and

1112
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:20,645
orders to send troops had

1113
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:22,079
already been signed.

1114
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,980
i mean, we... we were way down

1115
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,814
the road here.

1116
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:24,949
what i wanted to convey is there

1117
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:27,351
was probably a better way for us

1118
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:28,486
to make this a better public

1119
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:29,953
case.

1120
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:30,887
narrator: that public case to

1121
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:32,822
go to war will be made by

1122
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:35,325
secretary of state colin powell

1123
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:38,128
in a pivotal speech vetted by

1124
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:42,098
the c.i.a. and george tenet.

1125
00:42:42,098 --> 00:42:43,500
we worked as hard as we knew

1126
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,001
how to make sure that the

1127
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,369
secretary was going to speak to

1128
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,138
the world on the basis on the

1129
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:49,939
truth as we understood it.

1130
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:51,807
now, we were also living in a

1131
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:53,242
time period where there was no

1132
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:55,945
outside intelligence service or

1133
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:58,213
experts or anybody who believed

1134
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:59,949
he did not have weapons of mass

1135
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:01,317
destruction.

1136
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,484
we know that saddam hussein

1137
00:43:02,484 --> 00:43:03,552
is determined to keep his

1138
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:05,588
weapons of mass destruction;

1139
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:07,622
he's determined to make more.

1140
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:08,823
leaving saddam hussein in

1141
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:09,991
possession of weapons of mass

1142
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:11,559
destruction for a few more

1143
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,094
months or years is not an

1144
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:14,329
option.

1145
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:15,463
narrator: and colin powell

1146
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:17,031
makes a startling claim about

1147
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,333
biological weapons that comes

1148
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,034
from a dubious source, a source

1149
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:22,437
some in the c.i.a. knew was

1150
00:43:22,437 --> 00:43:24,138
unreliable.

1151
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:25,739
we have firsthand

1152
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,608
descriptions of biological

1153
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,843
weapons factories on wheels and

1154
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:31,178
on rails.

1155
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:32,713
he has the ability to dispense

1156
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:34,214
these lethal poisons and

1157
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:36,350
diseases in ways that can cause

1158
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,120
massive death and destruction.

1159
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,521
it should've never been in

1160
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:42,889
the speech.

1161
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,624
this was an internal failure of

1162
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:46,993
some proportions inside c.i.a.

1163
00:43:46,993 --> 00:43:48,527
our senior officer in germany

1164
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:50,896
was writing cables in that there

1165
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:52,298
were problems with the source,

1166
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:53,633
"don't use this source."

1167
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:56,068
never surfaced to us, ever

1168
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:58,137
surfaced to us.

1169
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,939
you know, we let him down.

1170
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:01,273
and he knows how i feel about

1171
00:44:01,273 --> 00:44:04,342
all this.

1172
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,378
my fellow citizens, at this

1173
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:11,449
hour, american and coalition

1174
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,251
forces are in the early stages

1175
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,287
of military operations to disarm

1176
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:19,224
iraq, to free it's people.

1177
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,965
from grave danger.

1178
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,533
it's been 21 months since

1179
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,001
president bush launched the

1180
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,636
invasion of iraq based in large

1181
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,638
part on the faulty intelligence

1182
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,540
that saddam had weapons of mass

1183
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,608
destruction.

1184
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:38,642
the senate intelligence

1185
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,076
committee has issued a scathing

1186
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:41,744
report on c.i.a. intelligence

1187
00:44:41,744 --> 00:44:43,279
failures on the threat level of

1188
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,280
prewar iraq.

1189
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,549
we went to war in iraq based

1190
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:50,153
on false claims.

1191
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,354
we were all very surprised,

1192
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:52,622
frankly, that there were not

1193
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:53,923
weapons of mass destruction

1194
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:54,824
found.

1195
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,959
we got w.m.d. very wrong.

1196
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,027
our blame in this was not

1197
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:00,562
just that we were wrong.

1198
00:45:00,562 --> 00:45:02,898
we were and that's bad, but we

1199
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:04,766
did not communicate our

1200
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,301
ambiguity.

1201
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,236
we did not communicate that we

1202
00:45:08,236 --> 00:45:09,705
had anything except full

1203
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:11,773
confidence in our estimates to

1204
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:13,642
the policy-makers, and that's

1205
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:15,010
really the issue.

1206
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,378
our analysts were good and

1207
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:17,344
honest people.

1208
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:18,779
there's no political motivation

1209
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:19,647
here.

1210
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:20,981
we basically came to those

1211
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:21,782
conclusions.

1212
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:23,217
nobody cooked the books?

1213
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:23,984
no.

1214
00:45:23,984 --> 00:45:25,419
look... look, if we wanted to

1215
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,288
cook the books, if you wanted to

1216
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:28,689
cook the books, all you needed

1217
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:31,325
to do was say "iraq was directly

1218
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:33,027
involved in 9/11."

1219
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:34,795
game, set, match point, over.

1220
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:36,529
we never did that.

1221
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:38,364
so we were wrong, and we have to

1222
00:45:38,364 --> 00:45:40,166
take responsibility for that.

1223
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,735
but at the end of the day,

1224
00:45:41,735 --> 00:45:42,869
policymakers need to be a little

1225
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,104
bit more forthcoming about what

1226
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:46,706
their own motivations were-- in

1227
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:48,374
this instance, perhaps, how to

1228
00:45:48,374 --> 00:45:53,680
remake the middle east.

1229
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,013
narrator: the war rages on

1230
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:59,218
for eight years, sowing chaos

1231
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,320
and destruction...

1232
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,125
no electricity, no water,

1233
00:46:09,828 --> 00:46:11,630
everybody is suffering.

1234
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,465
my country, not british or

1235
00:46:14,465 --> 00:46:18,302
american.

1236
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:22,707
narrator: ...and leaving

1237
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:27,912
nearly 5,000 americans dead,

1238
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:32,582
30,000 wounded and hundreds of

1239
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:36,987
thousands of iraqis killed.

1240
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:50,332
an intelligence failure such

1241
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:54,804
as that that took place in 2003

1242
00:46:54,804 --> 00:46:58,440
changes history.

1243
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,608
narrator: rising from the

1244
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,911
ashes of iraq, a terror group

1245
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:06,081
known as isis.

1246
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:08,183
ruthless and barbaric, they will

1247
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,717
be a formidable enemy in the

1248
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:13,888
years ahead.

1249
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:20,028
but in the aftermath of 9/11,

1250
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:21,362
the c.i.a. faces a more

1251
00:47:21,362 --> 00:47:23,598
immediate threat: al qaeda is

1252
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:26,700
poised to strike america again.

1253
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,268
we could not afford to be hit

1254
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:29,303
again.

1255
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:31,305
everything that we hold dear was

1256
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:33,207
at risk.

1257
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,843
the greatest worry was if

1258
00:47:35,843 --> 00:47:38,178
they were that committed to the

1259
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:40,881
attack that took place on 9/11,

1260
00:47:40,881 --> 00:47:42,683
and they had that much hate in

1261
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:44,184
them, would they resort to a

1262
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:46,419
nuclear weapon someplace?

1263
00:47:46,419 --> 00:47:48,254
after 9/11, we received a

1264
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:50,089
report from a foreign service

1265
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:52,491
that said that in august of

1266
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:56,229
2001, bin laden and zawahiri sat

1267
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,464
at a campfire with pakistani

1268
00:47:58,464 --> 00:48:00,833
nuclear scientists representing

1269
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,436
a non governmental organization.

1270
00:48:03,436 --> 00:48:05,837
these nuclear scientists had

1271
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:08,206
talked to al qaeda about the

1272
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:10,242
practicalities of developing a

1273
00:48:10,242 --> 00:48:12,344
nuclear weapons capability.

1274
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:15,780
the pakistanis said, "well, you

1275
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,115
know, the hard part about this

1276
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:18,350
is acquiring the fissile

1277
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,718
material."

1278
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:21,219
and then, bin laden looked at

1279
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:22,686
him and said, "well, what makes

1280
00:48:22,686 --> 00:48:24,321
you think we don't already have

1281
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:27,958
it?"

1282
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,126
narrator: the c.i.a. believes

1283
00:48:29,126 --> 00:48:31,395
bin laden has the design,

1284
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:35,366
materials and target for a

1285
00:48:35,366 --> 00:48:37,301
nuclear weapon.

1286
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:39,203
we began to receive reporting

1287
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:40,604
that al qaeda had placed a

1288
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:43,840
nuclear weapon in new york city.

1289
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:51,014
narrator: intelligence points

1290
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:54,751
to subways, buildings, bridges--

1291
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:57,854
all targeted for destruction and

1292
00:48:57,854 --> 00:48:59,388
chilling evidence that the east

1293
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:01,623
coast of america was not the

1294
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:04,326
only target al qaeda had chosen.

1295
00:49:04,326 --> 00:49:08,130
the 9/11 plot had also a plot

1296
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,799
to attack the west coast of the

1297
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:13,735
u.s. simultaneously using

1298
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:19,040
airplanes hijacked from asia.

1299
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,476
bin laden turned down this part

1300
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:23,844
of the operation because he

1301
00:49:23,844 --> 00:49:26,180
considered it too complicated.

1302
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,882
narrator: but now, that plot

1303
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,550
to attack america's west coast

1304
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,053
is given new life.

1305
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,822
the c.i.a. goes into overdrive,

1306
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:36,324
knowing that the cost of another

1307
00:49:36,324 --> 00:49:38,625
9/11 would be beyond

1308
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:41,094
measurement.

1309
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:42,996
this period of time, with

1310
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:44,364
what we knew about their

1311
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:45,932
interest in weapons of mass

1312
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:47,867
destruction and what we knew

1313
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,970
about the conventional threats

1314
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,671
that we were seeing every day

1315
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:53,606
made it feel as if we were

1316
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:56,008
living a ticking time bomb every

1317
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:58,210
single day for a period of three

1318
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,046
years.

1319
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:17,161
they never stopped plotting

1320
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:21,632
against us.

1321
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:23,735
we captured people all along for

1322
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:25,403
the next ten years, and there

1323
00:50:25,403 --> 00:50:29,741
was always a plot involved.

1324
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,346
rashid rauf was the pakistani

1325
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:38,915
end of a plot going on in great

1326
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:40,584
britain called the wide-body

1327
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,386
plot-- incredibly significant

1328
00:50:42,386 --> 00:50:45,088
attack, multiple explosions on

1329
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:47,124
multiple wide-bodies almost

1330
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:49,192
simultaneously flying out of

1331
00:50:49,192 --> 00:50:51,227
great britain to a variety of

1332
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:52,728
cities in north america.

1333
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:55,965
can you imagine ten airplanes

1334
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:57,566
full of innocent people

1335
00:50:57,566 --> 00:51:00,036
disappearing en route to cities

1336
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:01,404
like new york, washington,

1337
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:04,140
miami, chicago, los angeles,

1338
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,775
montreal?

1339
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:09,210
it would have rivaled 9/11.

1340
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,045
narrator: british

1341
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:13,481
intelligence, mi5, tracks rashid

1342
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:16,684
rauf's al qaeda cell, his plans

1343
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:19,921
and his improvised weapons of

1344
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:21,256
destruction.

1345
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:23,124
they had gathered up an awful

1346
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:25,026
lot of hydrogen peroxide in a

1347
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:26,861
homemade recipe, turn it into an

1348
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:28,228
explosive and then put it into

1349
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:29,696
sports bottles.

1350
00:51:29,696 --> 00:51:31,165
so we had great concern on our

1351
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:32,900
side of the atlantic about

1352
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,035
"let's break this up."

1353
00:51:35,035 --> 00:51:36,837
the british wanted to build up

1354
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:38,338
as much physical evidence as

1355
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:40,641
possible, so we're saying, "they

1356
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:42,743
bought the hydrogen peroxide."

1357
00:51:42,743 --> 00:51:44,244
and they're saying, "we need to

1358
00:51:44,244 --> 00:51:46,879
build up more evidence."

1359
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:49,015
the plotters had already

1360
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:52,318
selected the ten flights they

1361
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,455
were going to blow up, and i

1362
00:51:55,455 --> 00:51:57,623
said to myself, "this is

1363
00:51:57,623 --> 00:52:01,327
imminent."

1364
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:04,397
narrator: with the london

1365
00:52:04,397 --> 00:52:06,832
plot heating up, rauf is in

1366
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:11,369
pakistan and so is the c.i.a.

1367
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:12,804
so, now i'm on a trip in

1368
00:52:12,804 --> 00:52:16,241
pakistan in august 2006 with my

1369
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:17,776
head of the national clandestine

1370
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:23,347
service, jose rodriguez.

1371
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:26,083
i was called in by the chief

1372
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,219
of pakistani intelligence and

1373
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:30,621
told, "we may have a chance to

1374
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:38,195
capture rauf tonight.

1375
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:39,830
he's going to go from point a to

1376
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,866
point b, and in between there is

1377
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:44,367
a police checkpoint.

1378
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,936
we can stop the bus, and we can

1379
00:52:46,936 --> 00:52:49,906
grab him."

1380
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:51,541
our headquarters personnel had

1381
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,744
pledged to mi5 that very day

1382
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:59,115
that we would not capture rauf,

1383
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:00,849
and i was told that prime

1384
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,852
minister blair had spoken with

1385
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:05,487
president bush that day, and

1386
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:06,755
they had agreed that they needed

1387
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:08,857
more time.

1388
00:53:12,427 --> 00:53:14,196
i was sitting in the car with

1389
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:15,931
chief of station.

1390
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:18,167
he gets a call saying, "the bus

1391
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,001
is coming.

1392
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:23,237
we need authorization to go in."

1393
00:53:23,237 --> 00:53:24,872
and the chief of station turns

1394
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:28,476
to me and says, "what do we do,

1395
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:30,511
boss?"

1396
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:35,283
so jose, in a very short

1397
00:53:35,283 --> 00:53:36,984
period of time, has to make a

1398
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:39,586
really big decision.

1399
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:44,591
if i took the time to call

1400
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:46,560
headquarters, it would be the

1401
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,129
equivalent of saying no to the

1402
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:51,798
operation.

1403
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:01,840
had airplanes fallen from the

1404
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,642
sky, i could see myself being

1405
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:05,544
hauled up to the congress.

1406
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:06,812
"let me get this straight, mr.

1407
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:08,581
rodriguez.

1408
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:11,584
you had a terrorist that wanted

1409
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:14,220
to blow up u.s. airliners within

1410
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,888
your grasp and you did not make

1411
00:54:16,888 --> 00:54:18,890
a decision?

1412
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:20,458
off with your head!"

1413
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,060
the decision he made was, "i

1414
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,661
can't pass up the opportunity to

1415
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,029
grab rashid rauf."

1416
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:26,364
so he does.

1417
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:29,734
we stopped a major attack

1418
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,502
against us.

1419
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,670
since then, of course, we can't

1420
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,072
take more than-- what is it--

1421
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:38,942
3.6 fluid ounces on airplanes,

1422
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,878
but that's a small price to pay.

1423
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:45,015
narrator: the plots keep

1424
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,684
coming, with osama bin laden

1425
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,353
still at large.

1426
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:50,520
where the hell was this guy

1427
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,755
that was our number one enemy?

1428
00:54:52,755 --> 00:54:54,924
every lead led nowhere for

1429
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,159
almost ten years, and it was

1430
00:54:57,159 --> 00:54:58,894
pretty frustrating.

1431
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:01,330
but then we had an indication

1432
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,434
from jordan there was a doctor,

1433
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:07,236
that if they were able to get

1434
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:09,372
him in to pakistan he might...

1435
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,840
he might be able to lead us to

1436
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,276
zawahiri, who was the second in

1437
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:16,378
command.

1438
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:17,445
narrator: the c.i.a. believes

1439
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:18,947
it has struck gold.

1440
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,416
humam al-balawi, a jordanian

1441
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:23,818
doctor, now promises to lead

1442
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:26,955
them to the mother lode.

1443
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:28,523
he had been a jihadist.

1444
00:55:28,523 --> 00:55:30,124
the jordanian intelligence

1445
00:55:30,124 --> 00:55:32,192
operation thought they had been

1446
00:55:32,192 --> 00:55:34,094
successful in flipping him.

1447
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:35,496
so there was a lot of excitement

1448
00:55:35,496 --> 00:55:37,164
and, obviously, you know,

1449
00:55:37,164 --> 00:55:38,899
officers who spent their whole

1450
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:41,001
life in intelligence and working

1451
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:42,903
on these kinds of issues felt

1452
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:44,772
that, "boy, this might be a big

1453
00:55:44,772 --> 00:55:46,707
break."

1454
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:47,974
narrator: c.i.a. officers

1455
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:49,542
like 30-year-old elizabeth

1456
00:55:49,542 --> 00:55:51,511
hanson and station chief

1457
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:53,913
jennifer matthews, a 20-year

1458
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:55,748
agency veteran.

1459
00:55:55,748 --> 00:55:57,083
jennifer matthews was in

1460
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,885
charge of the officers who were

1461
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,019
there.

1462
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:00,987
i wouldn't have hesitated a

1463
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:04,123
moment to put her into that

1464
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:06,191
position because of her

1465
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:07,859
capability and her proven

1466
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,061
record.

1467
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,196
jennifer i met in the late

1468
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:13,832
1990s when i first came to the

1469
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:15,600
counterterrorism center.

1470
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,903
we were both working on

1471
00:56:17,903 --> 00:56:19,471
understanding the support

1472
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:20,872
network to al qaeda in

1473
00:56:20,872 --> 00:56:23,742
afghanistan, and we were also

1474
00:56:23,742 --> 00:56:25,443
pregnant at the same time,

1475
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:26,544
multiple times.

1476
00:56:26,544 --> 00:56:27,712
she had three children.

1477
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:31,248
her three tracked with my... my

1478
00:56:31,248 --> 00:56:33,150
third, fourth and fifth.

1479
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,286
she was chasing bin laden

1480
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:37,154
before chasing bin laden was

1481
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:39,056
cool, and she had actually based

1482
00:56:39,056 --> 00:56:41,192
her professional career on

1483
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:43,360
tracking al qaeda and

1484
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,498
identifying its adherents.

1485
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:49,466
narrator: but to get to

1486
00:56:49,466 --> 00:56:51,634
osama bin laden, matthews and

1487
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:53,703
her c.i.a. team want a

1488
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:55,538
face-to-face meeting with

1489
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:57,340
al-balawi.

1490
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,875
it's a gamble that must be

1491
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,543
approved by director panetta.

1492
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,145
we at the c.i.a. felt we had

1493
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:05,547
to establish our own credibility

1494
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,149
with this guy, and, to do that,

1495
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:08,317
you really have to sit down with

1496
00:57:08,317 --> 00:57:10,886
him and do a meeting to really

1497
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:12,855
gain some insight as to who

1498
00:57:12,855 --> 00:57:15,791
we're dealing with.

1499
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:21,295
the vehicle comes in to the

1500
00:57:21,295 --> 00:57:22,430
base.

1501
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,631
they brought him through some of

1502
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:25,233
the checkpoints.

1503
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,301
they make the decision that they

1504
00:57:27,301 --> 00:57:29,170
are all going to go out to greet

1505
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,438
him.

1506
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:31,205
one of the mistakes that was

1507
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:32,874
made was there was no body

1508
00:57:32,874 --> 00:57:33,474
search.

1509
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:34,675
there was no check.

1510
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:37,011
they thought that it would show

1511
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:39,646
that, you know, that they were

1512
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,548
friendly and that they were all

1513
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:43,216
anxious to be able to work with

1514
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:45,719
him.

1515
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:47,187
narrator: but al-balawi is

1516
00:57:47,187 --> 00:57:49,990
not about to turn into a c.i.a.

1517
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,458
spy.

1518
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:52,526
we will beat you, c.i.a.

1519
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:53,527
team.

1520
00:57:53,527 --> 00:57:54,895
inshallah, we will beat you

1521
00:57:54,895 --> 00:57:55,762
down.

1522
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:57,096
don't think that you just

1523
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:58,364
pressing a button, killing

1524
00:57:58,364 --> 00:58:00,032
mujahideen, you are safe.

1525
00:58:00,032 --> 00:58:02,268
inshallah, death will come to

1526
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:03,068
you.

1527
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:04,003
narrator: this is the video

1528
00:58:04,003 --> 00:58:06,605
he made laying out his plans,

1529
00:58:06,605 --> 00:58:09,275
his martyr suicide video.

1530
00:58:09,275 --> 00:58:10,876
look, this is for you.

1531
00:58:10,876 --> 00:58:12,211
it's not watch.

1532
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:14,680
it's detonator to kill as much

1533
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,114
as i can, inshallah.

1534
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:17,615
this is my job, to kill you.

1535
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:18,750
narrator: al-balawi is an al

1536
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:22,921
qaeda agent ready to kill, ready

1537
00:58:22,921 --> 00:58:24,289
to die.

1538
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:25,190
and you will be sent to the

1539
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,891
hell.

1540
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:28,660
his hands were hidden.

1541
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,861
they demanded that he take his

1542
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:31,196
hands out.

1543
00:58:31,196 --> 00:58:33,665
they kept yelling at him.

1544
00:58:33,665 --> 00:58:38,235
and before they knew it, he had

1545
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:41,772
detonated his suicide vest.

1546
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:46,376
it blew up everyone who was in

1547
00:58:46,376 --> 00:58:48,545
the area, and the ball bearings

1548
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:50,047
from the vest actually went

1549
00:58:50,047 --> 00:58:52,082
under the vehicle and tore the

1550
00:58:52,082 --> 00:58:54,784
legs of several other officers

1551
00:58:54,784 --> 00:58:56,385
who were there so that almost

1552
00:58:56,385 --> 00:58:58,354
everybody who was in that

1553
00:58:58,354 --> 00:59:00,823
semicircle was wounded or

1554
00:59:00,823 --> 00:59:02,892
killed.

1555
00:59:05,828 --> 00:59:08,598
it was a very, very grim

1556
00:59:08,598 --> 00:59:11,900
reminder about just how much our

1557
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,337
officers put themselves at risk.

1558
00:59:15,337 --> 00:59:18,473
that was a terrible, terrible

1559
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:21,109
loss for the agency and really,

1560
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,945
really shook it.

1561
00:59:23,945 --> 00:59:24,813
narrator: seven c.i.a.

1562
00:59:24,813 --> 00:59:28,383
officers are dead, including

1563
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,219
elizabeth hanson and her friend,

1564
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:35,890
jennifer matthews.

1565
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,758
i have one memory of jennifer

1566
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:40,060
that is the one i choose to

1567
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,629
recall.

1568
00:59:41,629 --> 00:59:42,730
one time, jennifer and i were

1569
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,633
traveling overseas, and we were

1570
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:49,836
in a tiny little beat-up car.

1571
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,704
she has the radio up, all

1572
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:53,373
crackly and horrible.

1573
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:56,543
but you hear the unmistakable

1574
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,245
piano intro to gloria gaynor's

1575
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:01,748
"i will survive," which any

1576
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:03,883
woman can tell you is one of our

1577
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:05,451
anthems.

1578
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:08,086
and jennifer cranks that radio

1579
01:00:08,086 --> 01:00:10,822
all the way up, belting out, "as

1580
01:00:10,822 --> 01:00:12,324
long as i know how to love, i

1581
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:14,393
know i will survive," just

1582
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:16,261
dancing.

1583
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:18,096
as long as i know how to love

1584
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:20,165
i know i'll stay alive

1585
01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:22,834
that's how i remember her

1586
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:24,770
living, larger than life.

1587
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,105
she just was all heart.

1588
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:30,007
as much as al qaeda thinks they

1589
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:32,109
destroyed her that day, they

1590
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:37,381
made her immortal.

1591
01:00:37,381 --> 01:00:39,884
she will always survive.

1592
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,660
it was very personal,

1593
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,329
personal for me, personal for

1594
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:55,231
the other officers at the c.i.a.

1595
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,600
narrator: it isn't long

1596
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,001
before leon panetta makes that

1597
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:00,270
life-and-death decision, calling

1598
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,372
in a deadly drone strike on the

1599
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:04,974
mastermind of that suicide

1600
01:01:04,974 --> 01:01:07,509
bombing-- the strike that also

1601
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:09,645
killed his family.

1602
01:01:09,645 --> 01:01:10,479
probably the biggest

1603
01:01:10,479 --> 01:01:13,949
consequence was that the gut

1604
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:19,221
feeling in every officers' inner

1605
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:23,725
being that that their goal was

1606
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,128
to go after the leadership of al

1607
01:01:27,128 --> 01:01:29,964
qaeda.

1608
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:35,737
we needed to get real-time

1609
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:37,772
information as fast as we

1610
01:01:37,772 --> 01:01:39,340
possibly could to protect the

1611
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,907
country and ensure there wasn't

1612
01:01:40,907 --> 01:01:43,777
another attack on the homeland.

1613
01:01:43,777 --> 01:01:45,212
narrator: the c.i.a. under

1614
01:01:45,212 --> 01:01:46,980
george tenet now embarks on a

1615
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,715
controversial interrogation

1616
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:51,218
program that will come back to

1617
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:54,821
haunt it, one that begins with a

1618
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,758
single prisoner.

1619
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:01,827
abu zubaydah was a major

1620
01:02:01,827 --> 01:02:03,562
terrorist facilitator and

1621
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:05,598
planner on the part of al qaeda.

1622
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,800
we believed that he had

1623
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,335
important and significant

1624
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:12,438
information to provide.

1625
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:18,543
and through an incredibly

1626
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:21,413
difficult targeting effort, we

1627
01:02:21,413 --> 01:02:24,215
were able to finally capture him

1628
01:02:24,215 --> 01:02:27,819
in march of 2002.

1629
01:02:29,921 --> 01:02:31,389
there was a firefight and abu

1630
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:34,292
zubaydah is severely wounded, so

1631
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,828
we needed to take him somewhere

1632
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:39,930
where we could interrogate him

1633
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,865
ourselves, away from the public

1634
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:46,003
light.

1635
01:02:46,003 --> 01:02:47,538
we needed a place to talk to

1636
01:02:47,538 --> 01:02:48,739
them.

1637
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,507
where's that going to be?

1638
01:02:50,507 --> 01:02:51,809
if you're going to do it a

1639
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,310
jailhouse in pakistan, you're

1640
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,011
going to get a hugely bad

1641
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:56,479
outcome because: a, nothing's

1642
01:02:56,479 --> 01:02:57,980
going to be secret and probably

1643
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,148
nobody is going to survive the

1644
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:00,516
session, plus there will be a

1645
01:03:00,516 --> 01:03:01,718
riot on the main street in about

1646
01:03:01,718 --> 01:03:05,655
15 minutes.

1647
01:03:05,655 --> 01:03:06,856
should we bring them back to

1648
01:03:06,856 --> 01:03:08,091
the united states?

1649
01:03:08,091 --> 01:03:09,292
give them the full protection of

1650
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:11,194
the u.s. constitution?

1651
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:13,929
allow them to have lawyers

1652
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:15,731
present to protect their rights

1653
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:16,932
as if they were american

1654
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:17,999
citizens?

1655
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:19,067
i'd like to know, what are you

1656
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:20,135
going to tell the director of

1657
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:25,607
central intelligence to do?

1658
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:26,408
narrator: in order to

1659
01:03:26,408 --> 01:03:27,976
interrogate their prisoners, the

1660
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:29,678
c.i.a. creates a network of

1661
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:33,681
so-called black sites, secret

1662
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:35,416
prisons that eventually will

1663
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,618
hold at least 119 suspected al

1664
01:03:37,618 --> 01:03:41,021
qaeda terrorists.

1665
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:45,626
in charge of the sites is jose

1666
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:47,561
rodriguez.

1667
01:03:47,561 --> 01:03:49,063
the black sites were

1668
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:52,132
instrumental in helping us gain

1669
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:55,034
very invaluable information.

1670
01:03:55,034 --> 01:03:56,336
some critics might say,

1671
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:57,904
"well, wait a minute, you wanted

1672
01:03:57,904 --> 01:03:59,506
to be able to abuse this guy.

1673
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:00,740
you didn't want any rules.

1674
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,574
you wanted to..."

1675
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:03,042
well, that's...

1676
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:03,643
"...torture the guy."

1677
01:04:03,643 --> 01:04:04,177
that's bullshit.

1678
01:04:04,177 --> 01:04:06,212
we get accused by human right

1679
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:10,015
activists that we created this

1680
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:11,750
black site in order to abuse

1681
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:12,751
people.

1682
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:17,256
in fact, by accepting prisoners,

1683
01:04:17,256 --> 01:04:19,191
we actually became responsible

1684
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:21,960
for them, for their health, for

1685
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,964
them totally.

1686
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:31,602
abu zubaydah had provided some

1687
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,071
early useful information, and

1688
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,674
then he stopped talking.

1689
01:04:36,674 --> 01:04:38,176
george tenet was going to the

1690
01:04:38,176 --> 01:04:39,710
white house every day and the

1691
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,579
president was asking george,

1692
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,115
"what is abu zubaydah saying

1693
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:45,715
about the second wave of attacks

1694
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,783
and about all these other

1695
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:47,651
programs?"

1696
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:48,718
well, he was not saying

1697
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,021
anything, and we knew we had to

1698
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:52,689
do something different.

1699
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,991
and over the summer months of

1700
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,994
2002 put together what became

1701
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,396
the enhanced interrogation

1702
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:04,433
program.

1703
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,968
narrator: to run its program,

1704
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,169
the c.i.a. hires two

1705
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,504
psychologists who had trained

1706
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,406
u.s. airmen to resist enemy

1707
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,607
torture.

1708
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,842
they have no experience in

1709
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,710
interrogation and no knowledge

1710
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,079
of al qaeda, but their company

1711
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,548
is paid a staggering sum of $81

1712
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:23,918
million.

1713
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:24,919
a lot of people talked about

1714
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:26,554
"just have tea with the guy and

1715
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:28,423
establish some sort of rapport."

1716
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:29,991
i get it.

1717
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:33,094
i get that if you've got time.

1718
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:34,562
we didn't have time.

1719
01:05:34,562 --> 01:05:35,730
we needed to accelerate the

1720
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:38,867
process.

1721
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:40,101
what we were trying to do was to

1722
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:42,402
move individuals from a zone of

1723
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:44,738
defiance into a zone of

1724
01:05:44,738 --> 01:05:47,007
cooperation, and then the

1725
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,711
intelligence gathering began.

1726
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:54,381
narrator: under c.i.a.

1727
01:05:54,381 --> 01:05:56,250
supervision, detainees would be

1728
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,086
slapped and grabbed; deprived of

1729
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:02,722
sleep; forced onto liquid diets;

1730
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:04,824
even confined in a coffin-like

1731
01:06:04,824 --> 01:06:09,929
box with live insects.

1732
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:11,464
there was nudity.

1733
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:12,965
there was water dousing, cramped

1734
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:15,635
confinement, stress positions.

1735
01:06:15,635 --> 01:06:16,702
narrator: and then there is a

1736
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:18,403
technique made infamous by

1737
01:06:18,403 --> 01:06:21,139
hollywood: waterboarding.

1738
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:22,707
where was the last time you

1739
01:06:22,707 --> 01:06:24,209
saw bin laden?

1740
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:25,911
where was the last time you saw

1741
01:06:25,911 --> 01:06:28,413
bin laden, huh?

1742
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:30,982
when you lie to me, i hurt you.

1743
01:06:30,982 --> 01:06:32,884
the opening scene of "zero

1744
01:06:32,884 --> 01:06:35,186
dark thirty," where you see all

1745
01:06:35,186 --> 01:06:38,088
these prisoners being abused by

1746
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:41,959
c.i.a. officers, spontaneous

1747
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:44,261
waterboarding with a pail--

1748
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:47,197
total bullshit.

1749
01:06:47,197 --> 01:06:48,899
made up stuff.

1750
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:50,834
waterboarding as practiced by

1751
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:53,904
the chinese, the nazis, the

1752
01:06:53,904 --> 01:06:57,140
spanish inquisition is torture

1753
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,175
and has always been torture.

1754
01:06:59,175 --> 01:07:00,543
but the waterboarding that was

1755
01:07:00,543 --> 01:07:03,579
applied was different, okay.

1756
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:04,781
how is it different?

1757
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:06,149
it's different because it

1758
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:07,383
doesn't use as much water.

1759
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:14,089
they don't drown anybody.

1760
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:16,191
the body responds as if the

1761
01:07:16,191 --> 01:07:18,093
body thinks its drowning.

1762
01:07:18,093 --> 01:07:19,594
am i happy we had to do it?

1763
01:07:19,594 --> 01:07:21,363
of course not.

1764
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:23,966
we had doctors there to make

1765
01:07:23,966 --> 01:07:26,835
sure that no harm came to the

1766
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:27,970
individual.

1767
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,639
i'm not trying to minimize how

1768
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,709
unpleasant this technique was.

1769
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:36,844
it is not torture.

1770
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,346
you know, lawyers looked at

1771
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,447
this.

1772
01:07:39,447 --> 01:07:40,681
had they said, this is torture,

1773
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,283
we would not do it.

1774
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:43,651
the most important thing that

1775
01:07:43,651 --> 01:07:47,755
happens here is these techniques

1776
01:07:47,755 --> 01:07:49,290
and the proposal to use these

1777
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:51,491
techniques on any human being

1778
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:52,759
are sent to the department of

1779
01:07:52,759 --> 01:07:54,060
justice immediately because we

1780
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,695
want to know that it is legal

1781
01:07:55,695 --> 01:07:57,897
under u.s. law and does not in

1782
01:07:57,897 --> 01:08:00,033
any way compromise our adherence

1783
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,267
to international torture

1784
01:08:01,267 --> 01:08:02,102
statutes.

1785
01:08:02,102 --> 01:08:03,336
and the attorney general of the

1786
01:08:03,336 --> 01:08:05,405
united states told us that it

1787
01:08:05,405 --> 01:08:06,539
did not.

1788
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,541
it's also important to know that

1789
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:09,775
the president of the united

1790
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:11,543
states authorized these

1791
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:12,878
techniques.

1792
01:08:12,878 --> 01:08:13,979
the president read the memo,

1793
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:15,114
looked at the techniques and

1794
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:16,281
decided he was going to take two

1795
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:17,649
techniques off the table

1796
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:18,617
himself.

1797
01:08:18,617 --> 01:08:20,019
i do not know nor do i recall

1798
01:08:20,019 --> 01:08:21,320
what techniques were taken off

1799
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,488
the table.

1800
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:24,223
only three detainees were

1801
01:08:24,223 --> 01:08:25,824
ever waterboarded, by the way.

1802
01:08:25,824 --> 01:08:28,426
three killers that had american

1803
01:08:28,426 --> 01:08:29,360
blood on their hands were

1804
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,762
waterboarded by us.

1805
01:08:30,762 --> 01:08:32,230
give me a break.

1806
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:37,802
give me a break.

1807
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:39,137
narrator: but there are some

1808
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:42,273
inside the c.i.a. who have grave

1809
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:46,276
doubts.

1810
01:08:46,276 --> 01:08:47,377
there were a number of those

1811
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,113
techniques that i personally

1812
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:54,918
felt were inappropriate, not

1813
01:08:54,918 --> 01:09:00,824
necessary, beyond the pale.

1814
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:02,592
i was not in the... in the chain

1815
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:03,860
of command, but i was a c.i.a.

1816
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:04,327
officer.

1817
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:05,361
i was a senior c.i.a. officer at

1818
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:07,630
the time, and i had expressed

1819
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:13,269
my... my discomfort and my... my

1820
01:09:13,269 --> 01:09:16,272
concerns about these techniques,

1821
01:09:16,272 --> 01:09:17,506
believing that they were going

1822
01:09:17,506 --> 01:09:21,143
to come back to haunt us, the

1823
01:09:21,143 --> 01:09:22,445
c.i.a.

1824
01:09:22,445 --> 01:09:24,379
i did that with individuals,

1825
01:09:24,379 --> 01:09:25,914
colleagues at the agency.

1826
01:09:25,914 --> 01:09:27,882
did he ever come and complain

1827
01:09:27,882 --> 01:09:28,883
to you about the

1828
01:09:28,883 --> 01:09:29,584
enhanced-interrogation

1829
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:30,418
techniques?

1830
01:09:30,418 --> 01:09:31,152
nope.

1831
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:32,253
he never came to you and

1832
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:33,688
said, "hey, you know what,

1833
01:09:33,688 --> 01:09:34,689
george?

1834
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:35,824
i think this is wrong"?

1835
01:09:35,824 --> 01:09:36,558
nope.

1836
01:09:36,558 --> 01:09:37,192
he never did?

1837
01:09:37,192 --> 01:09:38,226
nope.

1838
01:09:38,226 --> 01:09:40,562
it's not as though i went up

1839
01:09:40,562 --> 01:09:41,795
and down the halls of the c.i.a.

1840
01:09:41,795 --> 01:09:42,629
and said, "we shouldn't be doing

1841
01:09:42,629 --> 01:09:43,297
this, we shouldn't be doing

1842
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:43,864
this."

1843
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:45,365
looking back on it now, should i

1844
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:48,001
have spoken out more loudly

1845
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:49,670
about it?

1846
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,605
maybe.

1847
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:54,641
i think about that a lot.

1848
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:56,777
now you say that this program

1849
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,812
was carefully managed.

1850
01:09:58,812 --> 01:10:00,114
yes.

1851
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,714
did anybody die?

1852
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:03,950
at the beginning of 2002 when

1853
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,986
we started to take prisoners, we

1854
01:10:06,986 --> 01:10:08,521
just did not know what we were

1855
01:10:08,521 --> 01:10:09,522
doing.

1856
01:10:09,522 --> 01:10:10,923
we are not jailers.

1857
01:10:10,923 --> 01:10:13,159
we don't have those skills.

1858
01:10:13,159 --> 01:10:15,895
and abuses were made, and we

1859
01:10:15,895 --> 01:10:17,530
have 'fessed up to those.

1860
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:18,564
early on in the program,

1861
01:10:18,564 --> 01:10:19,764
there were terrible mistakes

1862
01:10:19,764 --> 01:10:20,365
made.

1863
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:21,666
there were immediate justice

1864
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:23,001
department referrals made.

1865
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:24,236
and two people did die, and it's

1866
01:10:24,236 --> 01:10:26,371
regrettable.

1867
01:10:26,371 --> 01:10:27,639
narrator: one detainee,

1868
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:29,074
severely injured during his

1869
01:10:29,074 --> 01:10:31,143
capture, is left untreated

1870
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,011
during a c.i.a. interrogation at

1871
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:36,982
an iraqi prison and dies.

1872
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,383
another is shackled half-naked

1873
01:10:39,383 --> 01:10:41,986
on a cold floor at a c.i.a.

1874
01:10:41,986 --> 01:10:45,022
black site in afghanistan.

1875
01:10:45,022 --> 01:10:51,195
he is found dead of hypothermia.

1876
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:52,696
no charges are ever brought

1877
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:55,132
against the officers involved.

1878
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:57,934
it's awful that those things

1879
01:10:57,934 --> 01:11:00,336
happen, but happen... shit

1880
01:11:00,336 --> 01:11:01,437
happens, you know.

1881
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:02,739
i mean, you know, we were at

1882
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:04,140
war.

1883
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,777
the fog of war.

1884
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:08,845
narrator: some c.i.a.

1885
01:11:08,845 --> 01:11:10,113
officers who witness the

1886
01:11:10,113 --> 01:11:13,316
interrogations are so disturbed

1887
01:11:13,316 --> 01:11:18,387
they break down in tears.

1888
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:19,655
my personal view is, "thank

1889
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:22,524
god," all right?

1890
01:11:22,524 --> 01:11:24,426
i would not want anyone in that

1891
01:11:24,426 --> 01:11:26,361
room doing this to another human

1892
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:28,630
being if they were not

1893
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:31,600
emotionally disturbed by what it

1894
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,536
was they felt they had to do.

1895
01:11:35,536 --> 01:11:37,772
look, he's a terrorist, but he's

1896
01:11:37,772 --> 01:11:40,708
also a person, and i would never

1897
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:43,711
want agency officers to forget

1898
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:47,381
both realities.

1899
01:11:52,452 --> 01:11:53,954
narrator: george tenet says

1900
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:55,722
that abu zubaydah, his

1901
01:11:55,722 --> 01:11:57,691
resistance weakened, gives up a

1902
01:11:57,691 --> 01:11:59,292
valuable lead to the whereabouts

1903
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:01,361
of an al qaeda terrorist second

1904
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:03,697
in importance only to osama bin

1905
01:12:03,697 --> 01:12:07,267
laden himself.

1906
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:09,536
khalid sheikh mohammed, the

1907
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:11,337
architect of 9/11, was captured

1908
01:12:11,337 --> 01:12:13,272
as a result of an elaborate

1909
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:15,274
human operation that was

1910
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:17,843
informed by data that

1911
01:12:17,843 --> 01:12:22,214
interrogated detainees gave us.

1912
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:23,916
we took him to a black site

1913
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:25,184
where we would have the

1914
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:27,386
opportunity to debrief him on

1915
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:29,287
what he knew about threats

1916
01:12:29,287 --> 01:12:33,091
against our homeland.

1917
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:37,228
he was smart, scary smart.

1918
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:38,863
hannibal lecter.

1919
01:12:38,863 --> 01:12:40,632
pure evil.

1920
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:43,668
the type of individual that is

1921
01:12:43,668 --> 01:12:47,904
able to dream up different ways

1922
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:51,041
of killing us.

1923
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:52,676
we asked him, "what do you know

1924
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:55,712
about plots against the u.s.?"

1925
01:12:55,712 --> 01:12:57,481
and his answer was, "soon you

1926
01:12:57,481 --> 01:13:00,350
will know," which was a chilling

1927
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:04,021
response because we also knew

1928
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:05,622
that he was planning a second

1929
01:13:05,622 --> 01:13:09,659
wave of attacks.

1930
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,294
my name is daniel pearl.

1931
01:13:11,294 --> 01:13:12,895
i'm a jewish american.

1932
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:15,631
he eventually confessed to

1933
01:13:15,631 --> 01:13:18,734
the killing of daniel pearl, the

1934
01:13:18,734 --> 01:13:22,104
"wall street journal" reporter.

1935
01:13:22,104 --> 01:13:23,272
and it was like a matter of

1936
01:13:23,272 --> 01:13:24,806
fact.

1937
01:13:24,806 --> 01:13:27,442
he said, "look, i killed him.

1938
01:13:27,442 --> 01:13:29,878
i slaughtered him, cut him into

1939
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:31,379
pieces.

1940
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:35,684
i put him in a shallow grave."

1941
01:13:35,684 --> 01:13:37,652
he actually didn't have a

1942
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:39,888
problem with waterboarding.

1943
01:13:39,888 --> 01:13:43,857
he withstood waterboarding.

1944
01:13:43,857 --> 01:13:47,795
khalid sheikh mohammed knew that

1945
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:49,897
in all likelihood we would stop

1946
01:13:49,897 --> 01:13:51,799
at ten seconds, and he would

1947
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:53,534
count with his fingers.

1948
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:56,904
he would go and then look at us

1949
01:13:56,904 --> 01:13:58,472
like, "you know, hey, it's time

1950
01:13:58,472 --> 01:13:59,840
to stop."

1951
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,841
had it not been for the

1952
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:04,944
accumulation of techniques...

1953
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,046
and i think sleep deprivation

1954
01:14:07,046 --> 01:14:10,483
finally led him to become

1955
01:14:10,483 --> 01:14:12,051
compliant.

1956
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:13,553
afterwards, he wouldn't stop

1957
01:14:13,553 --> 01:14:16,756
talking.

1958
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:18,024
narrator: waterboarded and

1959
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:19,726
sleep-deprived, khalid sheik

1960
01:14:19,726 --> 01:14:21,426
muhammed would inadvertently

1961
01:14:21,426 --> 01:14:22,961
help point the c.i.a. to its

1962
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:24,963
ultimate target: osama bin

1963
01:14:24,963 --> 01:14:26,198
laden.

1964
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:27,799
it was only when a number of

1965
01:14:27,799 --> 01:14:30,769
detainees after interrogation

1966
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:33,105
revealed that indeed bin laden

1967
01:14:33,105 --> 01:14:34,373
had sent a message to his

1968
01:14:34,373 --> 01:14:35,807
operations chief via this

1969
01:14:35,807 --> 01:14:37,642
courier that flagged this

1970
01:14:37,642 --> 01:14:39,910
courier and caused him to rise

1971
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,212
to the top of the many

1972
01:14:41,212 --> 01:14:42,613
candidates of people we could

1973
01:14:42,613 --> 01:14:43,748
follow.

1974
01:14:43,748 --> 01:14:45,850
we then raised abu ahmed al

1975
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,352
kuwaiti as a name to khalid

1976
01:14:48,352 --> 01:14:49,754
sheik mohammed, who, at that

1977
01:14:49,754 --> 01:14:50,821
point, had become largely

1978
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:51,689
cooperative.

1979
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:52,957
and then, since we've got the

1980
01:14:52,957 --> 01:14:55,926
place wired, we hear k.s.m. tell

1981
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:58,027
other detainees, "don't talk

1982
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,396
about the courier."

1983
01:14:59,396 --> 01:15:01,164
and our folks in the bin laden

1984
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:04,667
cell go after abu ahmed one

1985
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,970
grain of sand at a time,

1986
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,072
identify him and follow him

1987
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:12,675
eventually to abbottabad.

1988
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:17,679
narrator: the mission that

1989
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,515
would kill osama bin laden--

1990
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,784
operation neptune spear-- would

1991
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:24,219
be a c.i.a. covert operation,

1992
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,587
the chain of command going

1993
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,389
straight from the president to

1994
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,491
c.i.a. director panetta to the

1995
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,326
navy seals.

1996
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,128
tonight, i can report to the

1997
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,430
american people and to the world

1998
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,798
that the united states has

1999
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,132
conducted an operation that

2000
01:15:38,132 --> 01:15:40,535
killed osama bin laden, the

2001
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:42,403
leader of al qaeda...

2002
01:15:42,403 --> 01:15:46,841
u.s.a., u.s.a., u.s.a.!

2003
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:48,776
hearing people outside the

2004
01:15:48,776 --> 01:15:50,411
gates of the white house

2005
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:53,079
chanting, "u.s.a., u.s.a.,

2006
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:57,117
c.i.a.," it was something that

2007
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:59,085
will be a memory that i'll have

2008
01:15:59,085 --> 01:16:02,389
for the rest of my life.

2009
01:16:08,995 --> 01:16:10,530
the c.i.a.'s enhanced

2010
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:12,264
interrogation techniques were

2011
01:16:12,264 --> 01:16:14,200
not an effective way to gather

2012
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,669
intelligence information.

2013
01:16:16,669 --> 01:16:18,938
the c.i.a. provided inaccurate

2014
01:16:18,938 --> 01:16:21,607
information to the white house,

2015
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:23,609
the department of justice,

2016
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:24,543
congress.

2017
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:27,079
the c.i.a. program was far more

2018
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:29,281
brutal than people were led to

2019
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:32,851
believe.

2020
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:34,285
the country deserved a

2021
01:16:34,285 --> 01:16:35,620
thoughtful assessment of what

2022
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,888
happened in the immediate years

2023
01:16:36,888 --> 01:16:38,156
after 9/11.

2024
01:16:38,156 --> 01:16:40,625
that's not what we got.

2025
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:42,227
they did things which i

2026
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:44,062
really consider immoral.

2027
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:45,363
c.i.a. interrogators used

2028
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:47,131
brutal techniques that went well

2029
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:48,799
beyond the limits of the law.

2030
01:16:48,799 --> 01:16:50,033
some of these practices

2031
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:51,368
amounted to torture.

2032
01:16:51,368 --> 01:16:52,603
we were very careful to stop

2033
01:16:52,603 --> 01:16:54,171
short of torture.

2034
01:16:54,171 --> 01:16:55,372
in the immediate aftermath of

2035
01:16:55,372 --> 01:16:57,708
9/11, we did some things that

2036
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,443
were wrong.

2037
01:16:59,443 --> 01:17:00,544
we did a whole lot of things

2038
01:17:00,544 --> 01:17:03,780
that were right, but we tortured

2039
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,617
some folks.

2040
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:09,018
we did some things that were

2041
01:17:09,018 --> 01:17:12,388
contrary to our values.

2042
01:17:12,388 --> 01:17:13,623
narrator: after a five-year

2043
01:17:13,623 --> 01:17:15,157
investigation of more than six

2044
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:16,559
million pages of c.i.a.

2045
01:17:16,559 --> 01:17:18,194
documents, the democratic

2046
01:17:18,194 --> 01:17:19,595
majority of the senate select

2047
01:17:19,595 --> 01:17:21,697
committee on intelligence issues

2048
01:17:21,697 --> 01:17:23,933
a scathing indictment.

2049
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:25,467
it says the agency misled

2050
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,435
congress about the brutality of

2051
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,237
its interrogation program and

2052
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:30,672
that no evidence was produced

2053
01:17:30,672 --> 01:17:32,541
that disrupted plots or saved

2054
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:35,377
lives.

2055
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,415
the effectiveness and morality

2056
01:17:40,415 --> 01:17:41,816
of the program would trigger an

2057
01:17:41,816 --> 01:17:43,718
impassioned debate among the

2058
01:17:43,718 --> 01:17:46,420
directors.

2059
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,955
people are throwing the word

2060
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,558
"torture" around, you know, as

2061
01:17:50,558 --> 01:17:52,059
if... as if we're... we're

2062
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:57,398
torturers.

2063
01:17:57,398 --> 01:17:59,133
i'm not going to ever accept the

2064
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,334
use of the word "torture" in

2065
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:02,535
front of what... what happened

2066
01:18:02,535 --> 01:18:03,503
here.

2067
01:18:03,503 --> 01:18:05,171
i'm not going to fall to that.

2068
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:06,406
if you think somebody knows

2069
01:18:06,406 --> 01:18:07,974
something that would help you

2070
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:10,877
save american lives, how far

2071
01:18:10,877 --> 01:18:13,513
should or could you go to get

2072
01:18:13,513 --> 01:18:14,881
that information?

2073
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:16,616
of course, the terrible word

2074
01:18:16,616 --> 01:18:18,351
"torture" comes to mind.

2075
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:20,086
the term "torture" is a very,

2076
01:18:20,086 --> 01:18:21,453
very loaded word.

2077
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:23,322
if you don't believe that

2078
01:18:23,322 --> 01:18:25,357
there is a distinction between

2079
01:18:25,357 --> 01:18:27,526
enhanced interrogation and

2080
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:29,962
torture, the conversation is

2081
01:18:29,962 --> 01:18:30,762
over.

2082
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:32,297
you can slice and dice the

2083
01:18:32,297 --> 01:18:34,199
semantics a number of different

2084
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,100
ways.

2085
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,902
i think it's hard to not

2086
01:18:36,902 --> 01:18:38,403
describe some of the techniques

2087
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:40,504
that were used as torture.

2088
01:18:40,504 --> 01:18:42,640
if i were captured by an

2089
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,575
adversary and somebody slapped

2090
01:18:44,575 --> 01:18:45,943
me in the face, would i come

2091
01:18:45,943 --> 01:18:47,044
back and say i was tortured?

2092
01:18:47,044 --> 01:18:48,079
no.

2093
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:49,246
if somebody waterboarded me,

2094
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:50,281
would i come back and say i was

2095
01:18:50,281 --> 01:18:51,582
tortured?

2096
01:18:51,582 --> 01:18:52,717
yes.

2097
01:18:52,717 --> 01:18:54,051
i think it was torture.

2098
01:18:54,051 --> 01:18:58,822
i really do.

2099
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:01,024
history will judge us by our

2100
01:19:01,024 --> 01:19:03,326
commitment to a just society

2101
01:19:03,326 --> 01:19:05,128
governed by law and the

2102
01:19:05,128 --> 01:19:07,497
willingness to face an ugly

2103
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:12,836
truth and say "never again."

2104
01:19:12,836 --> 01:19:14,738
i think it is a hopelessly

2105
01:19:14,738 --> 01:19:16,640
incorrect conclusion based on

2106
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,607
flawed information.

2107
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:21,110
our review was a meticulous

2108
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:23,779
and detailed examination of

2109
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:25,080
records.

2110
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,215
none of the principals

2111
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:27,783
involved in this were

2112
01:19:27,783 --> 01:19:29,151
interviewed, which is rather

2113
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:31,053
important because the alleged

2114
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:34,256
motive of this study was to find

2115
01:19:34,256 --> 01:19:36,524
out how this came to pass, what

2116
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:38,026
happened and make sure it never

2117
01:19:38,026 --> 01:19:39,227
happens again.

2118
01:19:39,227 --> 01:19:40,962
enhanced interrogation

2119
01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:42,497
techniques without any doubt in

2120
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:44,699
my mind produced unique

2121
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:47,835
intelligence that stopped plots,

2122
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:49,904
saved lives, took additional

2123
01:19:49,904 --> 01:19:51,372
senior al qaeda officers off the

2124
01:19:51,372 --> 01:19:52,907
battlefield.

2125
01:19:52,907 --> 01:19:54,875
we took 20 examples that the

2126
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,711
c.i.a. itself claimed to show

2127
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:59,413
the success of these

2128
01:19:59,413 --> 01:20:02,015
interrogations, and not a single

2129
01:20:02,015 --> 01:20:03,750
case holds up.

2130
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,118
they are virtually wrong in

2131
01:20:05,118 --> 01:20:08,321
all 20 of the cases.

2132
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:10,424
one of the 20 cases is a

2133
01:20:10,424 --> 01:20:12,025
senior al qaeda operative

2134
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:14,427
telling us that al qaeda had

2135
01:20:14,427 --> 01:20:17,496
moved to a particular city in

2136
01:20:17,496 --> 01:20:20,166
pakistan.

2137
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:21,734
that's what he told us before

2138
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,568
enhanced interrogation

2139
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:23,569
techniques.

2140
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:24,970
after enhanced interrogation

2141
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,739
techniques, he actually sits

2142
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,909
down with satellite photography

2143
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,576
and points out the actual

2144
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:33,311
building where senior al qaeda

2145
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:35,947
operatives are, which allows us

2146
01:20:35,947 --> 01:20:39,150
to go and deal with them.

2147
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,885
the value in my estimation as

2148
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:43,121
i sat at my 5:00 meeting every

2149
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:44,489
night and as we were using this

2150
01:20:44,489 --> 01:20:46,257
information to break up plots,

2151
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:48,226
capture leaders, stop further

2152
01:20:48,226 --> 01:20:49,426
attacks against the united

2153
01:20:49,426 --> 01:20:54,865
states, was enormously high.

2154
01:20:54,865 --> 01:20:56,800
without this program, heathrow

2155
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,335
airport would've been bombed.

2156
01:20:58,335 --> 01:20:59,636
other facilities in great

2157
01:20:59,636 --> 01:21:01,205
britain would've been bombed.

2158
01:21:01,205 --> 01:21:02,439
buildings in new york would've

2159
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:03,574
exploded.

2160
01:21:03,574 --> 01:21:04,775
suspension bridges would've been

2161
01:21:04,775 --> 01:21:08,144
taken down.

2162
01:21:08,144 --> 01:21:09,645
narrator: and tenet insists

2163
01:21:09,645 --> 01:21:10,913
that intelligence from the

2164
01:21:10,913 --> 01:21:12,949
enhanced interrogations leads to

2165
01:21:12,949 --> 01:21:15,351
the capture of a terrorist

2166
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,687
planning a spectacular attack.

2167
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:19,589
he had already recruited 17

2168
01:21:19,589 --> 01:21:22,291
southeast asians to engage in an

2169
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,726
airline plot against the west

2170
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:25,194
coast of the united states.

2171
01:21:25,194 --> 01:21:26,262
the value is...

2172
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:27,662
the report says you had that

2173
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:29,264
information from other sources.

2174
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,832
the report is dead wrong on

2175
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:32,768
every account, period, end of

2176
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:35,837
paragraph.

2177
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:42,177
the bin laden operation would

2178
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:44,012
not have been possible without

2179
01:21:44,012 --> 01:21:45,980
the courier in question being

2180
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,515
highlighted as prominently as he

2181
01:21:47,515 --> 01:21:50,284
was by detainees.

2182
01:21:50,284 --> 01:21:51,051
narrator: director john

2183
01:21:51,051 --> 01:21:52,853
brennan, who was troubled by the

2184
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:55,156
brutal techniques, says the jury

2185
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:56,724
is out.

2186
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:57,658
what i'm saying is that

2187
01:21:57,658 --> 01:21:59,360
there's no way to know whether

2188
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,195
or not khalid sheikh mohammed

2189
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:02,229
would have provided that

2190
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:04,464
information if he had not been

2191
01:22:04,464 --> 01:22:05,498
waterboarded.

2192
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:07,834
that is unknowable because that

2193
01:22:07,834 --> 01:22:09,302
scenario never happened.

2194
01:22:09,302 --> 01:22:10,637
director brennan is a good

2195
01:22:10,637 --> 01:22:11,838
friend of mine and i have the

2196
01:22:11,838 --> 01:22:12,906
utmost respect for him, but i

2197
01:22:12,906 --> 01:22:14,607
would just respectfully disagree

2198
01:22:14,607 --> 01:22:15,542
with that.

2199
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:17,610
i mean, that strikes me as a

2200
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:19,078
dodge wrapped in political

2201
01:22:19,078 --> 01:22:22,015
correctness.

2202
01:22:22,015 --> 01:22:23,148
narrator: answers to some of

2203
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:24,583
these questions might have been

2204
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:26,985
found by watching videotape.

2205
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:28,253
the waterboarding of two

2206
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:30,122
prisoners was actually recorded,

2207
01:22:30,122 --> 01:22:32,191
but the videotapes were

2208
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:34,793
destroyed.

2209
01:22:34,793 --> 01:22:36,128
while i was still the

2210
01:22:36,128 --> 01:22:37,963
director in a morning briefing,

2211
01:22:37,963 --> 01:22:39,164
at the end of the briefing,

2212
01:22:39,164 --> 01:22:40,299
someone said, "oh, by the way,

2213
01:22:40,299 --> 01:22:42,200
the tapes were destroyed."

2214
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,901
and i rose out of my chair and

2215
01:22:43,901 --> 01:22:45,303
said, "what?"

2216
01:22:45,303 --> 01:22:49,240
my primary motivation in

2217
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,742
destroying the tapes was to

2218
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:53,878
protect the people who work for

2219
01:22:53,878 --> 01:22:54,912
me.

2220
01:22:54,912 --> 01:22:56,581
they showed people naked, being

2221
01:22:56,581 --> 01:23:00,217
waterboarded and going through

2222
01:23:00,217 --> 01:23:01,318
the enhanced interrogation

2223
01:23:01,318 --> 01:23:02,219
techniques.

2224
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:03,386
jose knows how i feel about

2225
01:23:03,386 --> 01:23:04,087
it.

2226
01:23:04,087 --> 01:23:05,789
he left me in a horrible,

2227
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:07,257
horrible spot.

2228
01:23:07,257 --> 01:23:09,292
my concern was, it would cause a

2229
01:23:09,292 --> 01:23:10,794
firestorm on the hill

2230
01:23:10,794 --> 01:23:12,896
politically because everybody

2231
01:23:12,896 --> 01:23:14,197
would assume there was something

2232
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:15,899
to hide rather than something to

2233
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:16,967
show.

2234
01:23:16,967 --> 01:23:19,468
i knew that the tapes would

2235
01:23:19,468 --> 01:23:21,570
play as if, you know, we were

2236
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:24,473
all psychopaths, and that's

2237
01:23:24,473 --> 01:23:26,976
something that we didn't want.

2238
01:23:26,976 --> 01:23:28,878
so, you had the director of

2239
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:30,779
national intelligence, the

2240
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:32,648
director of the c.i.a., a member

2241
01:23:32,648 --> 01:23:34,683
of congress all saying, "we

2242
01:23:34,683 --> 01:23:35,684
don't want these tapes

2243
01:23:35,684 --> 01:23:38,453
destroyed," and you did it.

2244
01:23:38,453 --> 01:23:40,221
now i was not stupid; i

2245
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:41,823
didn't one day decide to get out

2246
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:43,858
of bed and destroy tapes.

2247
01:23:43,858 --> 01:23:45,593
i got approval to do this.

2248
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:47,629
i consulted with our lawyers.

2249
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:49,697
the videotapes were destroyed

2250
01:23:49,697 --> 01:23:52,967
shortly after c.i.a. attorneys

2251
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:55,702
raised concerns that congress

2252
01:23:55,702 --> 01:24:01,608
might find out about the tapes.

2253
01:24:01,608 --> 01:24:03,844
narrator: a necessary evil or

2254
01:24:03,844 --> 01:24:09,283
a betrayal of american values?

2255
01:24:09,283 --> 01:24:10,951
somebody has to stand up and

2256
01:24:10,951 --> 01:24:13,053
be willing to say, "this is not

2257
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,954
what our country is about."

2258
01:24:14,954 --> 01:24:16,856
yes, we're facing a terrible

2259
01:24:16,856 --> 01:24:18,724
enemy, one who doesn't care

2260
01:24:18,724 --> 01:24:22,161
about who gets killed, but the

2261
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:24,330
united states is better than

2262
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:25,564
that.

2263
01:24:25,564 --> 01:24:27,066
our constitution does

2264
01:24:27,066 --> 01:24:28,901
prohibit "cruel and unusual"

2265
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:30,202
treatment.

2266
01:24:30,202 --> 01:24:32,637
if it's cruel, we shouldn't be

2267
01:24:32,637 --> 01:24:36,074
doing it.

2268
01:24:36,074 --> 01:24:37,943
we've got to have people who are

2269
01:24:37,943 --> 01:24:39,711
prepared to say, "mr. president

2270
01:24:39,711 --> 01:24:41,313
you can't do that.

2271
01:24:41,313 --> 01:24:42,614
it's illegal."

2272
01:24:42,614 --> 01:24:43,982
let's have a c.i.a. director

2273
01:24:43,982 --> 01:24:45,216
being interviewed here after the

2274
01:24:45,216 --> 01:24:47,352
second wave and... and you get

2275
01:24:47,352 --> 01:24:48,653
to ask him the question, "now,

2276
01:24:48,653 --> 01:24:50,821
look, the department of justice

2277
01:24:50,821 --> 01:24:54,024
said it was legal but yet you

2278
01:24:54,024 --> 01:24:56,527
refuse to do it.

2279
01:24:56,527 --> 01:24:57,561
how do you feel about your

2280
01:24:57,561 --> 01:24:59,596
decision now?"

2281
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:01,065
and so let's not pretend that

2282
01:25:01,065 --> 01:25:02,366
this is the forces of light and

2283
01:25:02,366 --> 01:25:03,934
forces of darkness.

2284
01:25:03,934 --> 01:25:05,402
these are two damn ugly

2285
01:25:05,402 --> 01:25:08,639
decisions.

2286
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:17,313
as the commander of the

2287
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:18,915
multinational force in iraq, we

2288
01:25:18,915 --> 01:25:21,651
actually had 27,000 detainees at

2289
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:23,586
the high watermark of our

2290
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:26,489
operations.

2291
01:25:31,393 --> 01:25:32,828
my view, quite simply, is that

2292
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:34,396
if you want information from a

2293
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:36,031
detainee, you become his best

2294
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:38,367
friend.

2295
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:40,002
you have to have very skilled

2296
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:41,670
interrogators, very skilled

2297
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,071
analysts and so forth.

2298
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:47,174
it's a long process.

2299
01:25:47,174 --> 01:25:48,876
these are the hardened, worst

2300
01:25:48,876 --> 01:25:50,611
terrorists responsible for the

2301
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:52,646
deaths of thousands of americans

2302
01:25:52,646 --> 01:25:54,148
in a period where we simply

2303
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,884
didn't believe we had time to

2304
01:25:56,884 --> 01:26:00,488
become their best friends.

2305
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:08,828
i just don't think a country

2306
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:12,799
like ours should be culpable of

2307
01:26:12,799 --> 01:26:14,801
conducting torture.

2308
01:26:14,801 --> 01:26:17,804
i just think it's beneath our

2309
01:26:17,804 --> 01:26:18,872
dignity.

2310
01:26:18,872 --> 01:26:20,573
i think it's poor for our

2311
01:26:20,573 --> 01:26:24,476
reputation in the world.

2312
01:26:24,476 --> 01:26:26,412
should a country, the united

2313
01:26:26,412 --> 01:26:28,414
states of america-- which stands

2314
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:29,915
for human rights in the world,

2315
01:26:29,915 --> 01:26:31,850
which stands for human dignity

2316
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,685
probably more than any country--

2317
01:26:33,685 --> 01:26:35,954
do those techniques to another

2318
01:26:35,954 --> 01:26:37,122
human being?

2319
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:38,357
right?

2320
01:26:38,357 --> 01:26:39,625
that's... that's a really

2321
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:42,460
reasonable question.

2322
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,262
one is, it's wrong.

2323
01:26:44,262 --> 01:26:45,696
but if you don't accept that,

2324
01:26:45,696 --> 01:26:47,565
don't do it because it typically

2325
01:26:47,565 --> 01:26:49,067
will bite you in the backside

2326
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:50,268
later on.

2327
01:26:50,268 --> 01:26:52,670
you will pay a price for what

2328
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,772
you do, and it will be vastly

2329
01:26:54,772 --> 01:26:56,207
greater than whatever it is you

2330
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,842
got out of taking this

2331
01:26:57,842 --> 01:27:00,011
particular action.

2332
01:27:00,011 --> 01:27:01,111
you can judge us.

2333
01:27:01,111 --> 01:27:02,412
we made those decisions for good

2334
01:27:02,412 --> 01:27:03,847
and valid reasons, and all i

2335
01:27:03,847 --> 01:27:06,950
would be able to say is we sat

2336
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,318
where we sat.

2337
01:27:08,318 --> 01:27:09,553
we decided what we did.

2338
01:27:09,553 --> 01:27:11,221
we understood the implications.

2339
01:27:11,221 --> 01:27:12,522
i can stand here today as

2340
01:27:12,522 --> 01:27:14,024
president of the united states

2341
01:27:14,024 --> 01:27:15,492
and say without exception or

2342
01:27:15,492 --> 01:27:16,893
equivocation that we do not

2343
01:27:16,893 --> 01:27:18,128
torture.

2344
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:20,329
given president obama's

2345
01:27:20,329 --> 01:27:21,864
criticism of enhanced

2346
01:27:21,864 --> 01:27:23,065
interrogation techniques, i

2347
01:27:23,065 --> 01:27:24,366
think one of the interesting

2348
01:27:24,366 --> 01:27:27,970
questions is: what would he have

2349
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:29,872
done had he been put in

2350
01:27:29,872 --> 01:27:32,308
president bush's shoes when

2351
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:33,676
george tenet came to him and

2352
01:27:33,676 --> 01:27:34,877
said, "you need to do this or

2353
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:37,146
americans are going to die"?

2354
01:27:37,146 --> 01:27:39,214
and obviously i don't know what

2355
01:27:39,214 --> 01:27:40,815
the president would've done, and

2356
01:27:40,815 --> 01:27:42,150
possibly he doesn't know what he

2357
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:48,756
would've done.

2358
01:27:48,756 --> 01:27:50,525
how do we make sure we are

2359
01:27:50,525 --> 01:27:53,061
not so caught up in the fear of

2360
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:57,898
an enemy that we begin to move

2361
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,433
away from the principles and the

2362
01:27:59,433 --> 01:28:01,401
standards that represent what

2363
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,670
this country's all about?

2364
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,305
and, you know, that's not an

2365
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:07,207
easy... there's not... there's

2366
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:08,976
not an easy answer to that.

2367
01:28:08,976 --> 01:28:10,177
i mean, some people think that

2368
01:28:10,177 --> 01:28:12,212
there is, but it's not.

2369
01:28:12,212 --> 01:28:14,081
the classic case, of course,

2370
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:16,149
is a nuclear weapon in downtown

2371
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:18,851
manhattan, hidden, and you have

2372
01:28:18,851 --> 01:28:20,486
in your hands the individual who

2373
01:28:20,486 --> 01:28:22,188
knows where it is.

2374
01:28:22,188 --> 01:28:23,456
would you waterboard him?

2375
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:24,323
let me turn it around.

2376
01:28:24,323 --> 01:28:25,691
would you?

2377
01:28:25,691 --> 01:28:27,326
the reality is, you have to

2378
01:28:27,326 --> 01:28:28,895
look at it in context.

2379
01:28:28,895 --> 01:28:31,430
i mean, if... if, in fact, you

2380
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:34,966
had credible intelligence that

2381
01:28:34,966 --> 01:28:36,801
there was a nuclear weapon

2382
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:38,737
planted someplace in new york

2383
01:28:38,737 --> 01:28:41,439
city or washington, d.c., and

2384
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:43,875
there was one person that would

2385
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:45,777
know where that bomb was

2386
01:28:45,777 --> 01:28:50,081
located, it'd be very tough not

2387
01:28:50,081 --> 01:28:51,715
to resort to every method

2388
01:28:51,715 --> 01:28:52,983
possible in order to get that

2389
01:28:52,983 --> 01:28:54,318
information.

2390
01:28:54,318 --> 01:28:55,519
i just have to be frank with

2391
01:28:55,519 --> 01:28:56,654
you.

2392
01:28:56,654 --> 01:28:58,055
if a president tomorrow asked

2393
01:28:58,055 --> 01:29:00,057
me to waterboard a terrorist, i

2394
01:29:00,057 --> 01:29:02,193
would say, "mr. president,

2395
01:29:02,193 --> 01:29:04,528
sorry, i do not believe that

2396
01:29:04,528 --> 01:29:06,597
that is what is in our best

2397
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:08,432
interest as a country, as an

2398
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:09,934
institution of c.i.a.

2399
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:11,668
and we need to find other ways

2400
01:29:11,668 --> 01:29:14,070
to get that intelligence."

2401
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,805
if some future president is

2402
01:29:15,805 --> 01:29:17,607
going to decide to waterboard,

2403
01:29:17,607 --> 01:29:19,075
he better bring his own bucket

2404
01:29:19,075 --> 01:29:20,376
because he's going to have to do

2405
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:21,611
it himself.

2406
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:22,745
the agency is not going to do

2407
01:29:22,745 --> 01:29:25,448
this again.

2408
01:29:33,522 --> 01:29:40,696
just as we were talking about

2409
01:29:40,696 --> 01:29:42,231
this senate intelligence

2410
01:29:42,231 --> 01:29:44,399
committee report on

2411
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:45,901
interrogation techniques and

2412
01:29:45,901 --> 01:29:48,169
torture, if you will, the

2413
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:49,770
question people need to ask

2414
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:51,272
themselves is, ten years from

2415
01:29:51,272 --> 01:29:53,307
now, will people be asking the

2416
01:29:53,307 --> 01:29:55,376
same questions about the use of

2417
01:29:55,376 --> 01:29:59,847
these drones?

2418
01:29:59,847 --> 01:30:00,982
narrator: they are lethal,

2419
01:30:00,982 --> 01:30:05,419
man-made birds of prey.

2420
01:30:05,419 --> 01:30:06,720
when you can stare at a

2421
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,589
target unblinkingly for hours,

2422
01:30:09,589 --> 01:30:12,058
if not days, and then use a

2423
01:30:12,058 --> 01:30:14,127
weapon against that target that

2424
01:30:14,127 --> 01:30:17,063
has a 14-pound warhead in it and

2425
01:30:17,063 --> 01:30:18,632
with an accuracy measured in

2426
01:30:18,632 --> 01:30:21,334
inches, this actually makes

2427
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:22,969
warfare more precise, and that

2428
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:23,470
should be a good.

2429
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:24,237
roger.

2430
01:30:24,237 --> 01:30:25,571
you are now free to engage the

2431
01:30:25,571 --> 01:30:26,639
vehicle.

2432
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:27,973
they give you the ability,

2433
01:30:27,973 --> 01:30:30,643
actually, to minimize civilian

2434
01:30:30,643 --> 01:30:33,379
casualties or collateral damage.

2435
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:34,580
unintelligible order.

2436
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,781
give me ten seconds.

2437
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:39,118
roger.

2438
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:40,252
direct hits.

2439
01:30:40,252 --> 01:30:41,487
right there.

2440
01:30:41,487 --> 01:30:42,554
now, the dark side.

2441
01:30:42,554 --> 01:30:44,188
the dark side is the ease with

2442
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,958
which a political decision maker

2443
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:48,459
can make the decision to do

2444
01:30:48,459 --> 01:30:51,429
this.

2445
01:30:54,832 --> 01:30:56,034
people need to be careful

2446
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,635
about being so happy with the

2447
01:30:57,635 --> 01:31:00,338
use of the term "kill."

2448
01:31:00,338 --> 01:31:01,505
intelligence officers in

2449
01:31:01,505 --> 01:31:02,673
particular have to worry about

2450
01:31:02,673 --> 01:31:06,710
the use of that term.

2451
01:31:14,384 --> 01:31:15,519
there are many times when

2452
01:31:15,519 --> 01:31:17,521
people are talking loosely about

2453
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:19,556
it or enthusing to me about it,

2454
01:31:19,556 --> 01:31:21,924
and i will say to them, "have

2455
01:31:21,924 --> 01:31:26,529
you ever killed someone?"

2456
01:31:29,965 --> 01:31:31,033
narrator: it was on george

2457
01:31:31,033 --> 01:31:33,202
tenet's watch in 2001 that

2458
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:35,338
drones, once just eyes in the

2459
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:39,708
sky, became killing machines.

2460
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,376
i had a question, and it is a

2461
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:43,278
question that still needs to be

2462
01:31:43,278 --> 01:31:45,447
asked today, as well: "do you

2463
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:47,582
want the civilian head of an

2464
01:31:47,582 --> 01:31:50,118
intelligence organization firing

2465
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:51,586
a weapon outside of the chain of

2466
01:31:51,586 --> 01:31:53,388
military command?"

2467
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:54,856
i needed to ask the question.

2468
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:56,124
they needed to answer the

2469
01:31:56,124 --> 01:31:57,124
question.

2470
01:31:57,124 --> 01:31:58,225
we never got the answer to the

2471
01:31:58,225 --> 01:32:01,762
question, and off we went.

2472
01:32:01,762 --> 01:32:02,863
narrator: why aren't all

2473
01:32:02,863 --> 01:32:04,565
drones operated by the military?

2474
01:32:04,565 --> 01:32:07,701
one reason: when a covert c.i.a.

2475
01:32:07,701 --> 01:32:10,304
operation goes badly, it can be

2476
01:32:10,304 --> 01:32:12,606
denied.

2477
01:32:12,606 --> 01:32:13,974
i obviously can't comment on

2478
01:32:13,974 --> 01:32:16,776
whether the c.i.a. conducts

2479
01:32:16,776 --> 01:32:18,044
operations that would be under

2480
01:32:18,044 --> 01:32:21,447
the realm of covert action.

2481
01:32:21,447 --> 01:32:22,849
covert action is, of course,

2482
01:32:22,849 --> 01:32:24,684
that you don't acknowledge them;

2483
01:32:24,684 --> 01:32:26,686
what you do is you just don't

2484
01:32:26,686 --> 01:32:28,287
talk about them.

2485
01:32:28,287 --> 01:32:29,322
narrator: in fact, the

2486
01:32:29,322 --> 01:32:31,157
c.i.a.'s drone warfare program

2487
01:32:31,157 --> 01:32:33,659
is so secret the agency does not

2488
01:32:33,659 --> 01:32:36,862
even acknowledge that it exists.

2489
01:32:36,862 --> 01:32:38,563
yet some directors are

2490
01:32:38,563 --> 01:32:39,931
surprisingly candid.

2491
01:32:39,931 --> 01:32:41,433
it's a covert action.

2492
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:44,002
it's an activity designed so

2493
01:32:44,002 --> 01:32:45,137
that the hand of the united

2494
01:32:45,137 --> 01:32:47,806
states is hidden.

2495
01:32:47,806 --> 01:32:48,807
it allows you to do it in

2496
01:32:48,807 --> 01:32:50,475
circumstances in which it would

2497
01:32:50,475 --> 01:32:51,777
be more difficult for the

2498
01:32:51,777 --> 01:32:55,146
military to do.

2499
01:32:59,884 --> 01:33:01,118
narrator: c.i.a. drone

2500
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:02,853
strikes were once rarely

2501
01:33:02,853 --> 01:33:05,189
conducted outside of war zones.

2502
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:07,892
the trouble was that was exactly

2503
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:10,828
where al qaeda was regrouping.

2504
01:33:10,828 --> 01:33:12,962
in the first half of 2008,

2505
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:14,764
c.i.a. made the case that we had

2506
01:33:14,764 --> 01:33:16,166
to begin to go do some things--

2507
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:17,667
targeted killings, for example--

2508
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:18,034
outside of

2509
01:33:18,034 --> 01:33:19,769
internationally-agreed theaters

2510
01:33:19,769 --> 01:33:20,770
of conflict.

2511
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:22,305
get this guy off the battlefield

2512
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:23,440
because "he's going to come kill

2513
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,974
you and your children" was

2514
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:26,676
absolutely compelling.

2515
01:33:26,676 --> 01:33:28,745
by mid-summer of 2008, our

2516
01:33:28,745 --> 01:33:30,179
government decided on a new

2517
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:34,349
course of action.

2518
01:33:34,349 --> 01:33:35,050
narrator: president george

2519
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:38,687
bush gives the green light, but

2520
01:33:38,687 --> 01:33:40,289
have drones given presidents and

2521
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:42,558
directors unchecked power?

2522
01:33:42,558 --> 01:33:44,293
the power to decide who lives

2523
01:33:44,293 --> 01:33:47,963
and who dies?

2524
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:51,132
(crowd protesting)

2525
01:33:51,132 --> 01:33:52,934
drone attacks violate every

2526
01:33:52,934 --> 01:33:55,436
human law because no law allows

2527
01:33:55,436 --> 01:33:57,271
anyone to become judge, jury and

2528
01:33:57,271 --> 01:33:58,072
executioner.

2529
01:33:58,072 --> 01:33:59,240
americans are ruthless

2530
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,107
people.

2531
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:01,342
they are against islam.

2532
01:34:01,342 --> 01:34:04,412
they are the tyrants.

2533
01:34:06,947 --> 01:34:07,747
you know, it's curious that

2534
01:34:07,747 --> 01:34:10,083
certain kinds of activity are

2535
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:12,419
called "assassination," others

2536
01:34:12,419 --> 01:34:14,221
are not.

2537
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:16,389
narrator: in 1976, president

2538
01:34:16,389 --> 01:34:18,792
gerald ford signs an order

2539
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:20,660
prohibiting the c.i.a. from

2540
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,929
engaging in assassination.

2541
01:34:22,929 --> 01:34:24,397
for example, the use of

2542
01:34:24,397 --> 01:34:25,731
drones going after particular

2543
01:34:25,731 --> 01:34:28,567
targets is not termed an

2544
01:34:28,567 --> 01:34:30,369
"assassination" in the sense of

2545
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:32,071
this executive order.

2546
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:32,738
why not?

2547
01:34:32,738 --> 01:34:34,173
why shouldn't it be?

2548
01:34:34,173 --> 01:34:35,174
i don't know.

2549
01:34:35,174 --> 01:34:36,208
it's a question you could answer

2550
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:37,610
as well as i do.

2551
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:38,444
there is a distinction

2552
01:34:38,444 --> 01:34:40,279
between a political

2553
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:41,780
assassination and against a

2554
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,148
targeted killing of an enemy

2555
01:34:43,148 --> 01:34:44,549
combatant after congress has

2556
01:34:44,549 --> 01:34:46,584
declared war against al qaeda.

2557
01:34:46,584 --> 01:34:47,552
and the authorization for the

2558
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,220
use of military force is a

2559
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,288
declaration.

2560
01:34:50,288 --> 01:34:51,856
it's as close to a declaration

2561
01:34:51,856 --> 01:34:54,392
of war as we will ever get in

2562
01:34:54,392 --> 01:34:55,960
this country again, and we are

2563
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,129
going after enemy combatants

2564
01:34:58,129 --> 01:34:59,163
consistent with the laws of

2565
01:34:59,163 --> 01:35:01,065
armed conflict.

2566
01:35:01,065 --> 01:35:01,900
narrator: president barack

2567
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,934
obama takes office after a

2568
01:35:03,934 --> 01:35:05,802
campaign critical of george

2569
01:35:05,802 --> 01:35:09,373
bush's war on terror, but under

2570
01:35:09,373 --> 01:35:11,608
the new commander in chief,

2571
01:35:11,608 --> 01:35:14,978
drone strikes rise dramatically.

2572
01:35:14,978 --> 01:35:16,346
national security looks

2573
01:35:16,346 --> 01:35:17,948
different from the oval than it

2574
01:35:17,948 --> 01:35:20,517
does from a hotel room in iowa.

2575
01:35:20,517 --> 01:35:22,518
to be able to go in, to

2576
01:35:22,518 --> 01:35:24,387
conduct surveillance, to target

2577
01:35:24,387 --> 01:35:26,188
those individuals and then to

2578
01:35:26,188 --> 01:35:28,691
conduct very precise attacks on

2579
01:35:28,691 --> 01:35:30,526
those individuals was the most

2580
01:35:30,526 --> 01:35:32,762
effective weapon we had.

2581
01:35:32,762 --> 01:35:33,796
(unintelligible commands)

2582
01:35:33,796 --> 01:35:35,531
clear to engage all.

2583
01:35:35,531 --> 01:35:37,433
this administration prefers

2584
01:35:37,433 --> 01:35:39,435
killing terrorists rather than

2585
01:35:39,435 --> 01:35:41,036
holding them captive.

2586
01:35:41,036 --> 01:35:42,537
and the reason i think is

2587
01:35:42,537 --> 01:35:43,705
because it's hard.

2588
01:35:43,705 --> 01:35:46,942
it's hard to capture.

2589
01:35:46,942 --> 01:35:49,511
it's... it's hard work.

2590
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:51,112
and many would consider it dirty

2591
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:52,314
business.

2592
01:35:52,314 --> 01:35:53,748
they're killing a lot of

2593
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:55,617
people with, let's say, drone

2594
01:35:55,617 --> 01:35:57,819
strikes that would better be

2595
01:35:57,819 --> 01:35:59,253
captured and interrogated, that

2596
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,754
we might have a chance of

2597
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:02,356
learning what the terrorist

2598
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:03,557
group is going to do next.

2599
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:05,192
you can't question somebody

2600
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:06,694
you've killed.

2601
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:07,695
so in other words, the c.i.a.

2602
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:08,662
is just, "we're taking no

2603
01:36:08,662 --> 01:36:10,531
prisoners?"

2604
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:11,932
i don't know that that's the

2605
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:14,868
c.i.a.'s position; i think

2606
01:36:14,868 --> 01:36:17,470
that's the president's position.

2607
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:20,540
i... i think he is killing more

2608
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,343
people than he needs to, and

2609
01:36:23,343 --> 01:36:24,644
we'd be better off capturing

2610
01:36:24,644 --> 01:36:25,979
some of them and interrogating

2611
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:29,282
them.

2612
01:36:29,282 --> 01:36:30,416
we will do everything

2613
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,418
possible to see if we can

2614
01:36:32,418 --> 01:36:33,786
prevent them from being

2615
01:36:33,786 --> 01:36:36,188
successful, capturing them.

2616
01:36:36,188 --> 01:36:38,390
and when that's not possible,

2617
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,791
well, then i think the president

2618
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:41,159
should have the ability to... to

2619
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:42,694
take action.

2620
01:36:42,694 --> 01:36:44,129
end the afghan war!

2621
01:36:44,129 --> 01:36:45,731
stop the drone attacks!

2622
01:36:45,731 --> 01:36:47,432
end the afghan war!

2623
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:49,167
stop the drone attacks!

2624
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:50,135
narrator: yet some watchdog

2625
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:52,137
organizations claim that

2626
01:36:52,137 --> 01:36:53,771
american drones have killed more

2627
01:36:53,771 --> 01:36:56,040
than a thousand civilians,

2628
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,142
numbers the u.s. government says

2629
01:36:58,142 --> 01:37:00,011
are greatly exaggerated.

2630
01:37:00,011 --> 01:37:02,346
u.s. strikes have resulted in

2631
01:37:02,346 --> 01:37:03,981
civilian casualties.

2632
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:06,083
those deaths will haunt us as

2633
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:08,619
long as we live.

2634
01:37:08,619 --> 01:37:09,520
narrator: the most

2635
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,454
controversial target in the

2636
01:37:10,454 --> 01:37:11,555
history of drone warfare is

2637
01:37:11,555 --> 01:37:13,757
about to enter the c.i.a.'s

2638
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:15,091
crosshairs.

2639
01:37:15,091 --> 01:37:16,126
to the american people, i say

2640
01:37:16,126 --> 01:37:18,628
your security will continue to

2641
01:37:18,628 --> 01:37:20,930
be threatened as long as your

2642
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,332
government continues with its

2643
01:37:22,332 --> 01:37:23,833
aggression against the muslim

2644
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:24,901
people.

2645
01:37:24,901 --> 01:37:25,935
narrator: he is anwar

2646
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:27,937
al-awlaki, a sworn enemy of the

2647
01:37:27,937 --> 01:37:31,206
united states and an american

2648
01:37:31,206 --> 01:37:32,408
citizen.

2649
01:37:32,408 --> 01:37:34,276
he was born in the u.s. and

2650
01:37:34,276 --> 01:37:36,845
was someone who was using social

2651
01:37:36,845 --> 01:37:39,982
media in order to convey a

2652
01:37:39,982 --> 01:37:42,451
message about jihad and doing it

2653
01:37:42,451 --> 01:37:44,253
very effectively, and was

2654
01:37:44,253 --> 01:37:47,389
someone who had gone to yemen.

2655
01:37:47,389 --> 01:37:49,323
there was no question in my mind

2656
01:37:49,323 --> 01:37:51,659
that he was extremely dangerous

2657
01:37:51,659 --> 01:37:53,261
and somebody that we had to go

2658
01:37:53,261 --> 01:37:54,662
after.

2659
01:37:54,662 --> 01:37:56,564
as you send us your bombs, we

2660
01:37:56,564 --> 01:37:57,865
will send you ours.

2661
01:37:57,865 --> 01:37:58,733
narrator: the charismatic

2662
01:37:58,733 --> 01:38:00,501
cleric conspires with the

2663
01:38:00,501 --> 01:38:02,103
so-called underwear bomber in a

2664
01:38:02,103 --> 01:38:03,571
failed plot to blow up an

2665
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:05,239
airliner over detroit on

2666
01:38:05,239 --> 01:38:08,175
christmas day 2009, and he

2667
01:38:08,175 --> 01:38:09,443
inspires the jihadist militant

2668
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:11,511
who kills 13 and injures more

2669
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,547
than 30 in a shooting spree at

2670
01:38:13,547 --> 01:38:15,716
fort hood, texas.

2671
01:38:15,716 --> 01:38:16,983
i was asking, "what were we

2672
01:38:16,983 --> 01:38:19,119
interested in al-awlaki about?"

2673
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,220
well, someone said, "well,

2674
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,089
he's... he's a bad guy.

2675
01:38:22,089 --> 01:38:23,990
he's on the president's list."

2676
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:26,359
so i said, "what list is that?"

2677
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:30,529
"well, the goodbye list."

2678
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:31,530
narrator: the "goodbye list,"

2679
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:35,201
also known as the "kill list."

2680
01:38:35,201 --> 01:38:36,268
it's the grim roster of

2681
01:38:36,268 --> 01:38:38,003
terrorists targeted for

2682
01:38:38,003 --> 01:38:40,172
execution by the u.s.

2683
01:38:40,172 --> 01:38:41,540
government.

2684
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,309
i, for one, was born in the

2685
01:38:43,309 --> 01:38:45,276
u.s. and lived in the u.s. for

2686
01:38:45,276 --> 01:38:46,878
21 years.

2687
01:38:46,878 --> 01:38:48,446
we went through the process

2688
01:38:48,446 --> 01:38:51,149
to make a case for why al-awlaki

2689
01:38:51,149 --> 01:38:54,486
was dangerous, and the justice

2690
01:38:54,486 --> 01:38:56,521
department, along with the our

2691
01:38:56,521 --> 01:38:57,822
general counsel and counsel out

2692
01:38:57,822 --> 01:38:59,624
of the white house, felt that a

2693
01:38:59,624 --> 01:39:01,493
good case had been made to put

2694
01:39:01,493 --> 01:39:03,694
him on that list.

2695
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:04,728
narrator: the "kill list" is

2696
01:39:04,728 --> 01:39:06,964
an open secret-- so open that

2697
01:39:06,964 --> 01:39:08,999
al-awlaki's father goes to a

2698
01:39:08,999 --> 01:39:10,968
u.s. court in a desperate effort

2699
01:39:10,968 --> 01:39:13,237
to have his son's life spared.

2700
01:39:13,237 --> 01:39:15,506
i want decent american lawyer

2701
01:39:15,506 --> 01:39:18,108
to tell me that it is right for

2702
01:39:18,108 --> 01:39:19,943
the united states government to

2703
01:39:19,943 --> 01:39:22,044
kill an american citizen on the

2704
01:39:22,044 --> 01:39:23,713
basis that he said something

2705
01:39:23,713 --> 01:39:25,281
against the united states or

2706
01:39:25,281 --> 01:39:26,849
against american soldiers.

2707
01:39:26,849 --> 01:39:28,751
i mean, i don't understand.

2708
01:39:28,751 --> 01:39:29,819
narrator: the petition is

2709
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:32,989
rejected.

2710
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,929
september 30, 2011: david

2711
01:39:40,929 --> 01:39:43,231
petraeus is now in charge when

2712
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:45,567
c.i.a. drone pilots in nevada

2713
01:39:45,567 --> 01:39:47,669
draw a bead on al-awlaki in

2714
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:49,437
yemen.

2715
01:39:49,437 --> 01:39:50,872
they have been watching him for

2716
01:39:50,872 --> 01:39:52,274
days.

2717
01:39:52,274 --> 01:39:53,708
get back on those guys.

2718
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:54,843
there you go.

2719
01:39:54,843 --> 01:39:55,677
i think you always do soul

2720
01:39:55,677 --> 01:39:57,746
searching when you're putting

2721
01:39:57,746 --> 01:39:59,747
individuals in harm's way.

2722
01:39:59,747 --> 01:40:01,515
you turn these over in your mind

2723
01:40:01,515 --> 01:40:03,150
and... and there are occasions

2724
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:04,785
where you say, "let me mull this

2725
01:40:04,785 --> 01:40:05,753
one.

2726
01:40:05,753 --> 01:40:07,421
let me think on it."

2727
01:40:07,421 --> 01:40:09,023
but if you ensure that you're

2728
01:40:09,023 --> 01:40:12,092
within the rules of engagement,

2729
01:40:12,092 --> 01:40:14,962
then you press forward and make

2730
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:18,231
a decision.

2731
01:40:18,231 --> 01:40:19,933
narrator: moments later,

2732
01:40:19,933 --> 01:40:23,870
anwar al-awlaki is dead.

2733
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:25,572
awlaki was the leader of

2734
01:40:25,572 --> 01:40:27,207
external operations for al

2735
01:40:27,207 --> 01:40:28,374
qaeda.

2736
01:40:28,374 --> 01:40:29,309
narrator: not since the civil

2737
01:40:29,309 --> 01:40:30,476
war has the u.s. government

2738
01:40:30,476 --> 01:40:32,245
executed one of its citizens

2739
01:40:32,245 --> 01:40:34,981
without an indictment, trial or

2740
01:40:34,981 --> 01:40:36,782
sentencing.

2741
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:38,984
the precedent of an american

2742
01:40:38,984 --> 01:40:41,353
president being able to kill an

2743
01:40:41,353 --> 01:40:44,156
american citizen under any

2744
01:40:44,156 --> 01:40:46,225
circumstances, on just his

2745
01:40:46,225 --> 01:40:49,361
signature, is dangerous.

2746
01:40:49,361 --> 01:40:51,563
there were nazis who were

2747
01:40:51,563 --> 01:40:53,232
u.s. citizens.

2748
01:40:53,232 --> 01:40:54,132
does that make them less of an

2749
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:55,967
enemy?

2750
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:57,168
there are terrorists who are

2751
01:40:57,168 --> 01:40:58,603
u.s. citizens.

2752
01:40:58,603 --> 01:41:00,071
does that somehow make them less

2753
01:41:00,071 --> 01:41:00,872
of an enemy?

2754
01:41:00,872 --> 01:41:02,340
i don't think so.

2755
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:04,041
in my book, a terrorist is a

2756
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:05,643
terrorist.

2757
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:07,411
i would prefer, under those

2758
01:41:07,411 --> 01:41:08,713
circumstances, that there was

2759
01:41:08,713 --> 01:41:12,116
some kind of external body where

2760
01:41:12,116 --> 01:41:14,351
the president would present the

2761
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:16,486
evidence to somebody outside of

2762
01:41:16,486 --> 01:41:18,855
the executive branch, to say, "i

2763
01:41:18,855 --> 01:41:20,223
think this is conclusive.

2764
01:41:20,223 --> 01:41:22,726
do you think this is conclusive?

2765
01:41:22,726 --> 01:41:23,860
i don't see that the

2766
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:26,229
president ever alone made a

2767
01:41:26,229 --> 01:41:28,098
decision on something like this.

2768
01:41:28,098 --> 01:41:30,133
there are a lot of people

2769
01:41:30,133 --> 01:41:32,534
involved in that discussion,

2770
01:41:32,534 --> 01:41:36,839
debate and decision-making.

2771
01:41:36,839 --> 01:41:38,307
there's a process and there's

2772
01:41:38,307 --> 01:41:40,709
certainly a discussion, but, at

2773
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:42,578
the end of the day, it's all

2774
01:41:42,578 --> 01:41:44,146
president's appointees, and then

2775
01:41:44,146 --> 01:41:46,649
it's the president's signature.

2776
01:41:46,649 --> 01:41:48,150
there is no outside review.

2777
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,352
there is no external evaluation

2778
01:41:50,352 --> 01:41:51,819
of the evidence.

2779
01:41:51,819 --> 01:41:53,421
this was an american citizen,

2780
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:55,523
and he was ultimately taken out,

2781
01:41:55,523 --> 01:41:58,026
but it's not something that

2782
01:41:58,026 --> 01:42:00,395
should be left to one person, no

2783
01:42:00,395 --> 01:42:04,198
matter who that person is.

2784
01:42:04,198 --> 01:42:06,301
narrator: anwar al-awlaki was

2785
01:42:06,301 --> 01:42:08,636
just one man, but the c.i.a.'s

2786
01:42:08,636 --> 01:42:11,004
drones have killed scores,

2787
01:42:11,004 --> 01:42:14,041
perhaps hundreds whose names are

2788
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:15,709
unknown.

2789
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:17,444
(unintelligible commands)

2790
01:42:17,444 --> 01:42:19,379
my worry is that there are

2791
01:42:19,379 --> 01:42:20,981
too many of what we would call

2792
01:42:20,981 --> 01:42:23,317
"signature strikes," which are

2793
01:42:23,317 --> 01:42:24,952
at a group of suspected

2794
01:42:24,952 --> 01:42:26,420
terrorists where the evidence

2795
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:28,287
may not be that clear of

2796
01:42:28,287 --> 01:42:30,856
specifically what is going on.

2797
01:42:30,856 --> 01:42:33,526
what about the so-called

2798
01:42:33,526 --> 01:42:35,261
signature strikes?

2799
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:36,662
i can't talk about signature

2800
01:42:36,662 --> 01:42:37,730
strikes.

2801
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,698
if they are even taken, i don't

2802
01:42:38,698 --> 01:42:39,865
know what they are.

2803
01:42:39,865 --> 01:42:40,967
i'm not talking about those

2804
01:42:40,967 --> 01:42:42,268
guys.

2805
01:42:42,268 --> 01:42:43,302
i don't believe these directors

2806
01:42:43,302 --> 01:42:46,805
are talking about this stuff.

2807
01:42:46,805 --> 01:42:48,406
i'm not talking about them.

2808
01:42:48,406 --> 01:42:49,507
you have every reason to

2809
01:42:49,507 --> 01:42:50,742
believe that there are bad guys

2810
01:42:50,742 --> 01:42:51,977
there at the moment.

2811
01:42:51,977 --> 01:42:53,578
you don't quite know the name of

2812
01:42:53,578 --> 01:42:55,313
the bad guy, but you know the

2813
01:42:55,313 --> 01:42:58,049
van, you know the weaponry, you

2814
01:42:58,049 --> 01:42:59,784
know the size of the group, you

2815
01:42:59,784 --> 01:43:00,885
know what kind of meetings have

2816
01:43:00,885 --> 01:43:02,887
been held there before, you know

2817
01:43:02,887 --> 01:43:06,256
the other vehicle that pulled up

2818
01:43:06,256 --> 01:43:09,960
and you make a decision.

2819
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:12,463
narrator: january 2015.

2820
01:43:12,463 --> 01:43:14,131
c.i.a. drones strike a terrorist

2821
01:43:14,131 --> 01:43:16,567
encampment in pakistan.

2822
01:43:16,567 --> 01:43:19,436
to the agency's surprise, killed

2823
01:43:19,436 --> 01:43:21,238
along with the terrorists are

2824
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:23,306
two hostages, including a

2825
01:43:23,306 --> 01:43:26,109
73-year-old american aid worker.

2826
01:43:26,109 --> 01:43:27,176
on the behalf of the united

2827
01:43:27,176 --> 01:43:29,045
states government, i offer our

2828
01:43:29,045 --> 01:43:30,713
deepest apologies to the

2829
01:43:30,713 --> 01:43:32,281
families.

2830
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:33,816
these were signature strikes.

2831
01:43:33,816 --> 01:43:35,551
the names of the targets were

2832
01:43:35,551 --> 01:43:36,886
not known.

2833
01:43:36,886 --> 01:43:38,988
mistakes, sometimes deadly

2834
01:43:38,988 --> 01:43:41,524
mistakes, can occur.

2835
01:43:41,524 --> 01:43:43,091
in some cases where people

2836
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,060
ended up dead, i don't know

2837
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:47,396
whether they were collaborators

2838
01:43:47,396 --> 01:43:49,398
or innocent bystanders, and

2839
01:43:49,398 --> 01:43:51,333
that's the problem with these

2840
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:53,568
kinds of remote button warfare

2841
01:43:53,568 --> 01:43:54,703
games.

2842
01:43:54,703 --> 01:43:56,738
i would rather up close and

2843
01:43:56,738 --> 01:43:57,906
personal.

2844
01:43:57,906 --> 01:43:59,841
this is hard, all right?

2845
01:43:59,841 --> 01:44:01,242
and anybody who makes these

2846
01:44:01,242 --> 01:44:02,343
kinds of decisions are going to

2847
01:44:02,343 --> 01:44:03,811
lose some sleep.

2848
01:44:03,811 --> 01:44:07,081
but you'd also lose sleep if you

2849
01:44:07,081 --> 01:44:10,117
failed to make these decisions

2850
01:44:10,117 --> 01:44:11,619
and bad things happen to

2851
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:14,755
americans.

2852
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:32,338
when people ask you, "what

2853
01:44:32,338 --> 01:44:33,973
keeps you awake at night?," what

2854
01:44:33,973 --> 01:44:36,409
i worried about a great deal was

2855
01:44:36,409 --> 01:44:38,143
the potential for a crippling

2856
01:44:38,143 --> 01:44:40,379
cyber attack on this country, a

2857
01:44:40,379 --> 01:44:43,816
cyber pearl harbor attack which

2858
01:44:43,816 --> 01:44:46,618
could paralyze our nation.

2859
01:44:46,618 --> 01:44:48,187
well, there are a number of

2860
01:44:48,187 --> 01:44:49,621
different possibilities that

2861
01:44:49,621 --> 01:44:50,689
could keep you up.

2862
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:52,491
it could be everything from a

2863
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:54,626
loose nuke somewhere, to the

2864
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:57,028
employment of some kind of novel

2865
01:44:57,028 --> 01:45:00,731
w.m.d. element in a densely

2866
01:45:00,731 --> 01:45:02,233
populated area of the united

2867
01:45:02,233 --> 01:45:05,703
states, to a very sophisticated

2868
01:45:05,703 --> 01:45:08,239
lone wolf attack.

2869
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:10,108
the homegrown terrorist bit

2870
01:45:10,108 --> 01:45:12,844
is a huge threat, even though

2871
01:45:12,844 --> 01:45:14,911
not in terms of fatalities in a

2872
01:45:14,911 --> 01:45:15,979
massive event, but in terms of

2873
01:45:15,979 --> 01:45:17,781
psychological warfare-- getting

2874
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:19,316
us to do things to restrict our

2875
01:45:19,316 --> 01:45:20,484
freedoms.

2876
01:45:20,484 --> 01:45:21,818
i mean, if you shut down every

2877
01:45:21,818 --> 01:45:23,353
mall in the country, you shut

2878
01:45:23,353 --> 01:45:25,021
down the trains, the planes, the

2879
01:45:25,021 --> 01:45:26,690
banks or whatever it may be,

2880
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:27,691
you've done... you've done

2881
01:45:27,691 --> 01:45:29,659
something.

2882
01:45:29,659 --> 01:45:32,229
narrator: ongoing threats,

2883
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:35,030
unrelenting pressure-- the

2884
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:36,398
burden of preventing the next

2885
01:45:36,398 --> 01:45:38,601
terrorist attack takes a

2886
01:45:38,601 --> 01:45:40,970
personal toll.

2887
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,405
i don't think you can go

2888
01:45:43,405 --> 01:45:46,375
through that kind of experience

2889
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:48,410
of having to make life and death

2890
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:51,813
decisions, having to every day,

2891
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:55,450
every day read intelligence

2892
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:57,385
about all of the evil that's out

2893
01:45:57,385 --> 01:45:59,354
there in the world and those

2894
01:45:59,354 --> 01:46:01,189
that want to strike at us.

2895
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:02,557
i don't think you can go through

2896
01:46:02,557 --> 01:46:04,559
those kinds of days and not have

2897
01:46:04,559 --> 01:46:06,427
it affect you.

2898
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:08,396
i think it does.

2899
01:46:08,396 --> 01:46:09,697
it's hard to have a positive

2900
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,365
view of human nature.

2901
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,633
there's an awful lot of dark

2902
01:46:12,633 --> 01:46:15,035
forces afoot in the world.

2903
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:17,271
it is your responsibility to

2904
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:19,072
look up at every plane and watch

2905
01:46:19,072 --> 01:46:20,707
every train, and you think,

2906
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:22,209
"what could go wrong?

2907
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:23,477
what could go wrong?

2908
01:46:23,477 --> 01:46:24,878
i need to be thinking about what

2909
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,680
can go wrong."

2910
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,915
i don't have a husband

2911
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:29,348
anymore.

2912
01:46:29,348 --> 01:46:32,051
i think, over the years, i had

2913
01:46:32,051 --> 01:46:34,420
just become such a robot in my

2914
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:37,256
approach to life because that

2915
01:46:37,256 --> 01:46:40,760
was what was needed on the job.

2916
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,862
i got all the trains off on time

2917
01:46:42,862 --> 01:46:44,297
and all that sort of thing with

2918
01:46:44,297 --> 01:46:47,332
the family, but they don't

2919
01:46:47,332 --> 01:46:49,000
necessarily see me as having

2920
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,602
been emotionally present in

2921
01:46:50,602 --> 01:46:52,437
their lives.

2922
01:46:52,437 --> 01:46:54,506
that's a hard thing to take.

2923
01:46:54,506 --> 01:46:56,808
the reason i'm so strong for

2924
01:46:56,808 --> 01:47:00,111
c.i.a. is, i saw their dedicated

2925
01:47:00,111 --> 01:47:02,247
men and women that work there

2926
01:47:02,247 --> 01:47:03,515
get no credit.

2927
01:47:03,515 --> 01:47:05,350
not out in the open at all.

2928
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:07,451
and i just admired their

2929
01:47:07,451 --> 01:47:09,920
patriotism and their dedication

2930
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,655
to this country.

2931
01:47:11,655 --> 01:47:13,424
it was very, very hard.

2932
01:47:13,424 --> 01:47:14,592
you know, i always noticed

2933
01:47:14,592 --> 01:47:16,694
something-- wives of c.i.a.

2934
01:47:16,694 --> 01:47:18,162
directors.

2935
01:47:18,162 --> 01:47:23,300
the wives are, to a person, of

2936
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,934
the view that the experience was

2937
01:47:24,934 --> 01:47:30,173
not good for their husbands.

2938
01:47:30,173 --> 01:47:31,474
narrator: the spymasters are

2939
01:47:31,474 --> 01:47:33,776
all too human-- their successes

2940
01:47:33,776 --> 01:47:36,579
often secret, their mistakes

2941
01:47:36,579 --> 01:47:40,283
exposed and magnified.

2942
01:47:40,283 --> 01:47:41,484
the scandal comes at a

2943
01:47:41,484 --> 01:47:43,218
sensitive time for petraeus and

2944
01:47:43,218 --> 01:47:45,220
the c.i.a.

2945
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,588
david petraeus is not the

2946
01:47:46,588 --> 01:47:48,056
first high-ranking washington

2947
01:47:48,056 --> 01:47:49,791
official to have an affair, but

2948
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:51,727
he is the first c.i.a. director

2949
01:47:51,727 --> 01:47:53,695
to resign because of one.

2950
01:47:53,695 --> 01:47:55,297
the petraeus indiscretions came

2951
01:47:55,297 --> 01:47:56,965
to the attention of the f.b.i.

2952
01:47:56,965 --> 01:47:59,534
you were confirmed in the job

2953
01:47:59,534 --> 01:48:02,803
by a vote of 92-0.

2954
01:48:02,803 --> 01:48:04,872
precipitous fall.

2955
01:48:04,872 --> 01:48:07,275
how tough was that?

2956
01:48:07,275 --> 01:48:08,709
precipitous falls are very

2957
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:09,844
tough.

2958
01:48:09,844 --> 01:48:11,145
you know, there's a saying in

2959
01:48:11,145 --> 01:48:12,246
the military, "the higher you go

2960
01:48:12,246 --> 01:48:13,981
up the flagpole, the more chance

2961
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:15,816
you have to show your backside."

2962
01:48:15,816 --> 01:48:17,918
and i was well up the flagpole

2963
01:48:17,918 --> 01:48:22,722
and did just that.

2964
01:48:22,722 --> 01:48:23,857
narrator: some directors

2965
01:48:23,857 --> 01:48:25,158
worry that the agency's mission

2966
01:48:25,158 --> 01:48:27,794
has changed, that the c.i.a.,

2967
01:48:27,794 --> 01:48:29,496
once an intelligence and

2968
01:48:29,496 --> 01:48:31,831
espionage service, has become

2969
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:36,169
too focused on lethal covert

2970
01:48:36,169 --> 01:48:41,106
action.

2971
01:48:41,106 --> 01:48:43,409
there's no doubt that c.i.a.

2972
01:48:43,409 --> 01:48:45,311
today has a much larger

2973
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:47,146
paramilitary mission than it

2974
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:49,381
ever has, going all the way back

2975
01:48:49,381 --> 01:48:50,883
to its roots.

2976
01:48:50,883 --> 01:48:52,718
there's no doubt that over the

2977
01:48:52,718 --> 01:48:54,520
long-term that's not a healthy

2978
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,789
thing, because the primary job

2979
01:48:57,789 --> 01:48:59,490
of the central intelligence

2980
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:01,025
agency is to collect secrets.

2981
01:49:01,025 --> 01:49:02,226
look, i'll be totally candid

2982
01:49:02,226 --> 01:49:03,594
with you.

2983
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:05,196
an awful lot of what we now call

2984
01:49:05,196 --> 01:49:06,964
analysis in the american

2985
01:49:06,964 --> 01:49:09,000
intelligence community is really

2986
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,335
targeting.

2987
01:49:10,335 --> 01:49:11,903
we're safer because of it, but

2988
01:49:11,903 --> 01:49:17,541
it has not been cost-free.

2989
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,042
i think there's too much of a

2990
01:49:19,042 --> 01:49:21,378
tendency to get so caught up in

2991
01:49:21,378 --> 01:49:24,214
the scintillating covert world,

2992
01:49:24,214 --> 01:49:26,216
that we forget that it's on the

2993
01:49:26,216 --> 01:49:27,818
analytical side and the

2994
01:49:27,818 --> 01:49:29,853
espionage side that c.i.a.

2995
01:49:29,853 --> 01:49:33,523
actually earns its money.

2996
01:49:33,523 --> 01:49:34,757
i mean, just think about the

2997
01:49:34,757 --> 01:49:36,559
past decade or more had we not

2998
01:49:36,559 --> 01:49:38,227
gone to war in iraq, what the

2999
01:49:38,227 --> 01:49:40,896
world would look like.

3000
01:49:40,896 --> 01:49:43,032
so... and that's an analytical

3001
01:49:43,032 --> 01:49:44,266
failure.

3002
01:49:44,266 --> 01:49:45,568
it doesn't mean you don't

3003
01:49:45,568 --> 01:49:46,602
kill.

3004
01:49:46,602 --> 01:49:47,803
it doesn't mean you don't

3005
01:49:47,803 --> 01:49:48,838
protect yourself.

3006
01:49:48,838 --> 01:49:50,072
there's just a bigger issue that

3007
01:49:50,072 --> 01:49:51,407
you have to get your arms

3008
01:49:51,407 --> 01:49:52,907
around, which is the creation of

3009
01:49:52,907 --> 01:49:59,681
terrorists in the first place.

3010
01:49:59,681 --> 01:50:01,683
look, let's be very candid.

3011
01:50:01,683 --> 01:50:03,551
this is about islam.

3012
01:50:03,551 --> 01:50:04,919
now, i'm not criticizing one of

3013
01:50:04,919 --> 01:50:06,388
the world's great monotheisms.

3014
01:50:06,388 --> 01:50:08,356
it's not about the quran, it's

3015
01:50:08,356 --> 01:50:10,058
not about the prophet, but it is

3016
01:50:10,058 --> 01:50:11,458
about the way it is being

3017
01:50:11,458 --> 01:50:16,330
misused.

3018
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:18,165
my view of this, frankly, is

3019
01:50:18,165 --> 01:50:20,000
that this is not so much

3020
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,870
religion as just evil, and we've

3021
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:24,938
always had to deal with evil.

3022
01:50:24,938 --> 01:50:28,075
i mean, people, people who do

3023
01:50:28,075 --> 01:50:31,477
evil things, they may excuse

3024
01:50:31,477 --> 01:50:34,680
what they do based on jihad,

3025
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,115
based on the power of the

3026
01:50:36,115 --> 01:50:39,519
church, but deep down these are

3027
01:50:39,519 --> 01:50:44,023
people who are evil.

3028
01:50:48,127 --> 01:50:49,494
civil uprisings quickly

3029
01:50:49,494 --> 01:50:51,563
became a tsunami of citizens

3030
01:50:51,563 --> 01:50:53,698
roaring for freedom.

3031
01:50:53,698 --> 01:50:54,966
there's been a transformation

3032
01:50:54,966 --> 01:50:56,001
of sorts in the middle east

3033
01:50:56,001 --> 01:50:58,770
because the arab spring, while

3034
01:50:58,770 --> 01:51:02,274
it has regressed in some ways,

3035
01:51:02,274 --> 01:51:03,875
they unleashed a series of

3036
01:51:03,875 --> 01:51:06,611
forces that basically said, "we

3037
01:51:06,611 --> 01:51:08,145
want a better way of life.

3038
01:51:08,145 --> 01:51:09,613
we want a functioning civil

3039
01:51:09,613 --> 01:51:16,787
society."

3040
01:51:16,787 --> 01:51:18,989
so, in part, the

3041
01:51:18,989 --> 01:51:20,925
message has to be to islam

3042
01:51:20,925 --> 01:51:24,628
itself, is, you have to create

3043
01:51:24,628 --> 01:51:26,529
vibrant civil societies that

3044
01:51:26,529 --> 01:51:28,798
work, that create educational

3045
01:51:28,798 --> 01:51:29,866
opportunities.

3046
01:51:29,866 --> 01:51:31,034
but this is something they have

3047
01:51:31,034 --> 01:51:32,635
to do for themselves.

3048
01:51:32,635 --> 01:51:34,103
dealing with this

3049
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:35,305
radicalization that's taking

3050
01:51:35,305 --> 01:51:37,073
place among these young men and

3051
01:51:37,073 --> 01:51:38,174
young women is the bigger

3052
01:51:38,174 --> 01:51:44,246
problem, and until we get our

3053
01:51:44,246 --> 01:51:46,248
arms around that, this war is

3054
01:51:46,248 --> 01:51:49,718
not going away.

3055
01:51:49,718 --> 01:51:52,221
the harsh truth is, terrorism

3056
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:53,689
is right now worse than it's

3057
01:51:53,689 --> 01:51:55,924
ever been.

3058
01:51:55,924 --> 01:51:57,259
it's the largest safe haven

3059
01:51:57,259 --> 01:51:58,494
they've had in more than a

3060
01:51:58,494 --> 01:52:00,696
decade with money, access,

3061
01:52:00,696 --> 01:52:05,366
narrative and territory.

3062
01:52:05,366 --> 01:52:06,901
i've come to the view in dealing

3063
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:09,904
with bad guys that generally you

3064
01:52:09,904 --> 01:52:11,772
should believe what they say.

3065
01:52:11,772 --> 01:52:12,840
most of them are going to try

3066
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:13,908
and do what they tell you

3067
01:52:13,908 --> 01:52:15,076
they're going to do.

3068
01:52:15,076 --> 01:52:16,777
for now, i would say the isis'

3069
01:52:16,777 --> 01:52:18,746
objective is to consolidate

3070
01:52:18,746 --> 01:52:20,815
their position in this so-called

3071
01:52:20,815 --> 01:52:22,682
caliphate, but unless they are

3072
01:52:22,682 --> 01:52:26,219
stamped out, they'll come here.

3073
01:52:26,219 --> 01:52:29,723
they'll come here. our

3074
01:52:29,723 --> 01:52:31,525
sensibilities and souls have

3075
01:52:31,525 --> 01:52:34,227
been gerard by the horrific and

3076
01:52:34,227 --> 01:52:36,863
wonton violence perpetrated upon

3077
01:52:36,863 --> 01:52:39,432
the innocent in the streets,

3078
01:52:39,432 --> 01:52:42,368
cafes and concert halls

3079
01:52:42,368 --> 01:52:45,104
in the beautiful city of paris.

3080
01:52:45,104 --> 01:52:47,640
to say we're not in their gun

3081
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,508
sights reminds me a little bit

3082
01:52:49,508 --> 01:52:52,611
too much of pre-9/11, where

3083
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:54,547
frankly the c.i.a. encountered,

3084
01:52:54,547 --> 01:52:56,282
in much of the world, what i

3085
01:52:56,282 --> 01:52:57,416
would call a climate of

3086
01:52:57,416 --> 01:52:58,483
disbelief.

3087
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:08,993
i wish we would just capture

3088
01:53:08,993 --> 01:53:12,797
some people.

3089
01:53:12,797 --> 01:53:14,132
i've got more fingers on this

3090
01:53:14,132 --> 01:53:15,500
hand than the number of people

3091
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,100
we've captured since i left

3092
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,468
government.

3093
01:53:18,468 --> 01:53:19,836
we've made it so legally

3094
01:53:19,836 --> 01:53:21,138
difficult and politically

3095
01:53:21,138 --> 01:53:22,806
dangerous to capture that we

3096
01:53:22,806 --> 01:53:23,907
don't.

3097
01:53:23,907 --> 01:53:25,208
we do not know what the rules

3098
01:53:25,208 --> 01:53:26,777
of engagement are.

3099
01:53:26,777 --> 01:53:28,245
are we dealing with enemy

3100
01:53:28,245 --> 01:53:29,413
combatants?

3101
01:53:29,413 --> 01:53:31,214
are we dealing with criminals?

3102
01:53:31,214 --> 01:53:33,817
are we dealing with thugs?

3103
01:53:33,817 --> 01:53:35,518
are the rules of engagement is,

3104
01:53:35,518 --> 01:53:36,686
we shoot first?

3105
01:53:36,686 --> 01:53:38,020
we only shoot if we get shot at?

3106
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:39,522
i do not believe that the...

3107
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:42,758
the remedy to terrorism is using

3108
01:53:42,758 --> 01:53:44,627
the pointy end of the spear,

3109
01:53:44,627 --> 01:53:46,329
kicking down the doors, taking

3110
01:53:46,329 --> 01:53:47,496
action against the terrorist

3111
01:53:47,496 --> 01:53:48,030
organizations.

3112
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:49,365
this is not an issue we can

3113
01:53:49,365 --> 01:53:50,666
kill our way out of.

3114
01:53:50,666 --> 01:53:52,368
you cannot kill your way out

3115
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:53,069
of this.

3116
01:53:53,069 --> 01:53:54,269
you cannot kill your way out.

3117
01:53:54,269 --> 01:53:55,570
you can't kill your way out

3118
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:56,338
of this.

3119
01:53:56,338 --> 01:53:57,672
that's a mistake.

3120
01:53:57,672 --> 01:53:58,840
it's a much bigger issue than

3121
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,041
just killing people.

3122
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:02,010
it's much more complicated.

3123
01:54:07,749 --> 01:54:09,117
now we can live in a world

3124
01:54:09,117 --> 01:54:10,485
where we all try to see who

3125
01:54:10,485 --> 01:54:11,886
could be the toughest, the

3126
01:54:11,886 --> 01:54:15,422
meanest and so forth, but it

3127
01:54:15,422 --> 01:54:16,957
isn't going to be the kind of

3128
01:54:16,957 --> 01:54:18,525
world that we believe we want

3129
01:54:18,525 --> 01:54:20,494
for our children and for their

3130
01:54:20,494 --> 01:54:26,300
children.

3131
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,068
i may be a bit of a heretic

3132
01:54:28,068 --> 01:54:30,571
because i don't really see

3133
01:54:30,571 --> 01:54:32,939
terrorists or terrorism as a

3134
01:54:32,939 --> 01:54:34,140
threat to u.s. national

3135
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:40,546
security.

3136
01:54:40,546 --> 01:54:42,749
to me, our nation's security is

3137
01:54:42,749 --> 01:54:45,785
only threatened by us if we

3138
01:54:45,785 --> 01:54:48,955
choose to change course and

3139
01:54:48,955 --> 01:54:53,258
become something that we're not.

3140
01:54:53,258 --> 01:54:55,360
so, if you look back at the

3141
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,697
fight against al qaeda and isis,

3142
01:54:58,697 --> 01:54:59,898
the big picture is a great

3143
01:54:59,898 --> 01:55:02,367
victory for us and a great

3144
01:55:02,367 --> 01:55:04,369
victory for them.

3145
01:55:04,369 --> 01:55:05,971
our great victory has been the

3146
01:55:05,971 --> 01:55:08,973
degradation, decimation, near

3147
01:55:08,973 --> 01:55:11,342
defeat of that al qaeda core

3148
01:55:11,342 --> 01:55:13,611
that brought that tragedy to our

3149
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:15,446
shores on 9/11.

3150
01:55:15,446 --> 01:55:16,981
their great victory has been the

3151
01:55:16,981 --> 01:55:19,717
spread of their ideology across

3152
01:55:19,717 --> 01:55:22,453
a huge geographic area.

3153
01:55:22,453 --> 01:55:29,526
that's been their great victory.

3154
01:55:29,526 --> 01:55:32,562
i fear and i realize that

3155
01:55:32,562 --> 01:55:34,898
we're not going to see an end to

3156
01:55:34,898 --> 01:55:36,433
terrorism in my lifetime or my

3157
01:55:36,433 --> 01:55:39,269
children's lifetime.

3158
01:55:47,342 --> 01:55:55,384
we're just going to have to

3159
01:56:04,158 --> 01:56:05,359
continue to do our jobs every

3160
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:07,495
day to minimize to the greatest

3161
01:56:07,495 --> 01:56:08,996
extent possible the ability of

3162
01:56:08,996 --> 01:56:11,099
these individuals to

3163
01:56:11,099 --> 01:56:13,000
successfully carry out these...

3164
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,138
these terrorist acts.

3165
01:56:17,138 --> 01:56:18,339
that's what intelligence is

3166
01:56:18,339 --> 01:56:19,407
really trying to do.

3167
01:56:19,407 --> 01:56:20,742
we're trying to give time and

3168
01:56:20,742 --> 01:56:22,976
space to policy makers, to our

3169
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,011
diplomats, to our negotiators to

3170
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:26,379
resolve some of these

3171
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:27,647
outstanding issues and tensions

3172
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:31,251
that exist in the world.

3173
01:56:31,251 --> 01:56:32,790
the reality is that

3174
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:34,725
intelligence or direct action

3175
01:56:34,725 --> 01:56:37,528
only buys you space.

3176
01:56:37,528 --> 01:56:39,163
it rarely solves the problem on

3177
01:56:39,163 --> 01:56:40,598
its own.

3178
01:56:40,598 --> 01:56:42,133
and if political leaders don't

3179
01:56:42,133 --> 01:56:43,801
have the wherewithal or the

3180
01:56:43,801 --> 01:56:45,102
courage or whatever it takes to

3181
01:56:45,102 --> 01:56:47,571
use the space, you get into this

3182
01:56:47,571 --> 01:56:49,006
