1
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,750
<i>When there's been a reduction in force</i>

2
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,290
<i>at the Central Intelligence Agency</i>

3
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,630
<i>and you're the one who's been riffed</i>

4
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,420
<i>it's not always easy to find a new job.</i>

5
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,720
<i>When a prospective employer
asks for your skills</i>

6
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>you can't very well say that
they've been blackmail, bribery</i>

7
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,310
<i>subversion, the odd kidnapping.</i>

8
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,270
<i>Still, there are legitimate businesses</i>

9
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,770
<i>who are looking for people...</i>

10
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,440
<i>exactly like you.</i>

11
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,500
Question correct.

12
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,850
Question correct.

13
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,360
Question correct.

14
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,570
Question correct.

15
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,700
Question correct.

16
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,160
Question correct.

17
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,330
Question correct.

18
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,440
Time's up.

19
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,690
I haven't quite finished yet.

20
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,720
Almost no one does.

21
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,990
Those who do are geniuses.
We're not in the market for genius.

22
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,110
Why not?
Smart's smart, isn't it?

23
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,120
Genius bores easily.

24
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,200
Tends to brood, then to plot.

25
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,250
Palace revolts?

26
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,870
Sexual conquests, mostly.

27
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,550
- So, what's next? More tests?
- No, that's the last.

28
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,340
After its scored, the computer
will work up a total evaluation.

29
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,340
If it's satisfactory,
you see Mr. Grimes.

30
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,560
What happens if the computer
doesn't like me?

31
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,850
We wave good-bye.

32
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,430
I'm gonna call this one
The Mitterand Misapprehension.

33
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,940
Mmm.

34
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,780
- So?
- Just what we expected.

35
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,900
He's an aggressive,
healthy heterosexual male...

36
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,620
with a superior IQ. of 141.

37
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,160
He's divorced, no children.
Has a BA. from Michigan in Political Science.

38
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,410
Good Spanish, fair French,
quite a little Arabic.

39
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,830
And according to his test results,
just a touch of paranoia.

40
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,840
Paranoia's good.
It keeps one careful.

41
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,830
How much was the bribe
to the Iraqi colonel?

42
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,970
$50,000 in gold.
The colonel swore he never got it.

43
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,010
Crowe swore he did.

44
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,810
The Agency paymaster believed the colonel.

45
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,310
So the Agency
dismissed Mr. Crowe.

46
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,310
After he broke the paymaster's jaw, yes.

47
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,000
- Hello, Mr. Grimes.
- Well. Mr. Nelson Crowe.

48
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,000
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

49
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,000
- Very well, thank you.
- Late of Managua, Amman...

50
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,000
- Panama and other garden spots.
- Yes.

51
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,000
Sit down, will you?

52
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,880
Welcome to the Tool Shed.

53
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,390
- Tool Shed.
- Ah, it's a bit before your time, I suspect.

54
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,070
Those infamous and long-ago Senate
hearings on covert operations run wild.

55
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,570
They called in old Nate Packer to testify.

56
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,110
- You've heard of him.
- Oh, who hasn't?

57
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,240
He's a man of impeccable manners.

58
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,830
Answered even the dumbest of questions
with care and courtesy.

59
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,960
Then somebody asked him the question
he most wanted to hear.

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,960
80 old Nate puts on this stud poker
expression of his...

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,960
and he tells the senators...

62
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,970
that the way to solve their loose cannon
or rogue elephant problems in covert ops...

63
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,180
is to round up some fit,
trained specimens...

64
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,310
much like Margaret here and yourself

65
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,930
and then lock them away
in a tool shed until they're needed.

66
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,020
- He really said "tool shed?
- Yes, he really did.

67
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,860
And that's when I had
a flash of pure inspiration.

68
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,280
I told myself, the government is never
gonna buy this brilliant concept...

69
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,280
but private industry might.

70
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,580
80 three years later, I left the Agency
and began building my very own tool shed.

71
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,790
Must be paying off, unless it's all front.

72
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,960
You might be interested to learn
that 21 of our clients...

73
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,000
are among the nation's top 500 companies...

74
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,170
and that's just our domestic side.

75
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,220
And we're equally active
in foreign clients, Mr. Crowe.

76
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,550
Once the world sensibly turned
from cold war to commerce...

77
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,560
we picked up half a dozen new clients...

78
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,100
a couple of them from behind
the erstwhile Iron Curtain.

79
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,100
So we are thriving, I assure you.

80
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,780
Doing whatever needs doing, for a price.

81
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,480
Precisely.
Do you care to join us?

82
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,370
- How much?
- How much?

83
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,370
75, to start.

84
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,370
- Say 80.
- Oh. He wants 80.

85
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,460
- He does.
- All right.

86
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,960
- When?
- When do you start?

87
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,960
Yes. - Would five minutes be
too much for you to handle?

88
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,930
- Not a problem.
- Margaret?

89
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,970
Let's say ten.

90
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,520
- Okay?
- Very well.

91
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,520
- Pleasure.
- Same here. Thank you, Mr. Grimes.

92
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,290
Nice neighborhood.

93
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,460
Oh, yeah, very respectable.

94
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,040
You'd be surprised.

95
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,510
Nothing much surprises me
anymore, Miss Wells.

96
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,180
And somehow, that doesn't surprise me.

97
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,180
So what's our assignment?

98
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,730
Information's on a need-to-know basis.

99
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,310
All right.

100
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,720
- You know how to work one of these?
- You bet.

101
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,610
-I wanna go higher,
- Where do you wanna go?

102
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,400
I wanna go higher;

103
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,860
- I wanna go higher
- Higher, baby

104
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,870
- What the fuck is this?
- As of COB today, Mr. Cartwain...

105
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,710
you are no longer president
of Curl Industries.

106
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,710
Maybe nobody told you, shit-for—brains...

107
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,920
but my sister is a major stockholder
in Curl Industries...

108
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,500
and if that little prick thinks he can
fire me... Your sister sees this tape...

109
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,470
of you and, um-

110
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,640
I-I don't think Mom's
gonna like this, Uncle Johnny.

111
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,810
- Uncle Johnny.
- Mm-mm-mmm.

112
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,580
Someday.

113
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,580
Yeah, right.

114
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,970
Where's my fucking money?

115
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,970
In the mailbox.
Where else?

116
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,180
All in fifties, like I said?

117
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,730
Mmm. $10,000 in fifties.

118
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,730
You know what?
That was kinda fun, wasn't it?

119
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,260
So, you're our F.N.G.

120
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,260
Yes, I am.

121
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,810
Your Fucking New Guy.

122
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,810
And you are?

123
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,560
Tod Stapp. With two p's.

124
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,070
Nice to meet you, Tod.
Nelson Crowe.

125
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,060
Margaret brief you?

126
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,820
- On just about everything, yes.
- Thank you.

127
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,660
- Everything but herself right?
- Right.

128
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,410
Well, to answer a few
of your unasked questions...

129
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,460
she's 36...

130
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,460
out of Holyoke, by way of the Agency.

131
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,460
- Married?
- Single.

132
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,170
- And you call her...
- Margaret.

133
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Or Ms. Wells.

134
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,640
- Never Maggie.
- Ah, Maggie.

135
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,560
What do you really call her?

136
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,890
Snow Queen.

137
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,270
Snow Queen. Right.

138
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,820
- Tell me about her, Margaret.
- Who?

139
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,830
Cartwain's niece.

140
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,330
- Is she really as young as they say?
- Younger. 16, at the most.

141
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,380
And pretty, hmm?

142
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,920
I hear they say she's very pretty.

143
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,340
Judge for yourself.

144
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,430
Yes.

145
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes. Yes.

146
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,570
You know, perhaps you should
have a copy of the tape itself.

147
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,650
- Perhaps I should.
- Mmm.

148
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,990
You know, uh...

149
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,990
if it weren't for my health...

150
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,080
I would've sacked Cartwain myself.

151
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,080
For his, uh, obstinacy and treachery.

152
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,250
And now this, this incest thing.

153
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,920
Could've blown us out of the water
on the Cross Creek case. - Could have.

154
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,970
Can't. Not anymore.

155
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,760
Let's talk about Cross Creek
vs. Curl Industries.

156
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,770
According to our inquiries,
the court is leaning 4-3 against you.

157
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,100
But I don't understand why.
Cross Creek has no case.

158
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,480
The facts and the truth support us.
All we want is simple justice.

159
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,900
Simple justice runs a bit high
these days, Walter.

160
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,360
If the court rules in Cross Creek's favor,
what'll it cost you? Hmm?

161
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,700
- Absolute minimum.
- $25 million, at least.

162
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,950
Ooh.

163
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,500
Now, for only four percent of that,
for a mere one million dollars...

164
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,380
you can buy yourself your very own
state supreme court justice...

165
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,460
and a favorable verdict.

166
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,630
Are you sure?

167
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,680
Are you positive?

168
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,680
Take a look at us, Walter.

169
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,020
Do either Margaret or I look
as if we want to go to jail?

170
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,560
Before you attempt to suborn a state supreme
court justice or even a justice of the peace...

171
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
you first make sure he's got his hand out.

172
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,070
Way out. Way out to here.

173
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,900
Two no-trump, doubled.

174
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,730
Game and rubber.

175
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,900
How much, Les?

176
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,900
It's 970 to you, Beachie.

177
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,570
Phil gets off with 210, and the Doc...

178
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,740
breaks even.

179
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,040
I got lucky on that last finesse, judge.

180
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Oh. It's not luck.
That was skill.

181
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,630
Well, bedtime.

182
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,630
- Same time next week, gentlemen?
- Mmm.

183
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,760
Care for a nightcap, Beachie?

184
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,760
- Goodnight, Judge. Goodnight, Les.
- Sure. Good night.

185
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,100
I don't really want a nightcap.

186
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm holding $19,000 worth of these already.

187
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,200
This'll almost make it an even 20.

188
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,950
I won't carry anyone for that much, not even
a guy who's the older brother I never had.

189
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,000
Just 'til Friday, Les.
Monday at the latest.

190
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,040
Look...

191
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,340
if you really need twenty or
thirty thousand, all you have to do is ask.

192
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,340
But cards are my living, and if people know
I'm holding your markers...

193
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,390
they might get the idea I've gone soft.

194
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,930
Easy.

195
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,230
And I can't afford that.

196
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,690
I understand, Les. I do.

197
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,690
- I understand.
- No, you don't-

198
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,820
This afternoon I got a call from
Bobby Birdsong, our mutual bookie.

199
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Bobby's carrying you for $25,000...

200
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,370
and is so worried he offered
to sell it to me for $15,000.

201
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,080
I said, No, thanks.

202
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,550
Friday, Les. Everything'll be fine
by Friday. Don't worry.

203
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,930
Beachie...

204
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,090
after Friday...

205
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,220
somebody else will do the worrying.

206
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,020
Understand?

207
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,380
You're mine,

208
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,340
- 9331.
- I'm in.

209
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,430
One across, four letters.
Pan's beginning to leak.

210
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,640
Right.

211
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,160
♫ I wanna know ♫
♫ what you got to say ♫

212
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,870
♫ I wanna know ♫
♫ what you got to say ♫

213
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,870
♫ I wanna know ♫
♫ what you got to say ♫

214
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,210
♫ I can tell you taste like the sky, ♫

215
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,920
♫ Cause you look like rain ♫

216
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:06,090
- Pan's beginning to leak.
- Look like rain, look like rain,

217
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,220
♫ You look like rain, ♫

218
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,220
♫ Drippin'. ♫
♫ Look like rain, ♫

219
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,910
What?

220
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,000
It's who, not what.
Margaret Wells, that's who.

221
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,020
Jesus.

222
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,030
You do drink scotch, don't you?

223
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,400
- Who do you plan to buy with?
- A judge.

224
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,240
What do you got here, about $25,000?

225
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,080
- Thirty.
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,580
- Want water?
- Straight, please.

227
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,920
What kind of judge?

228
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,710
Small claims court, traffic court, what?

229
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,340
State supreme court.

230
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,430
State supreme court.

231
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,230
Well, the $30,000 buys us an introduction.

232
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,730
His full price is one million.

233
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,730
Hmm.

234
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,060
- Can we sit down?
- Mmm.

235
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,030
There aren't any chairs.

236
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,030
Bed's fine.

237
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,080
He's a degenerate gambler, this judge.

238
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,670
Let me guess.

239
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,170
We're gonna buy up his markers.

240
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,180
- You are quick, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,930
Markers are the stick.

242
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,930
Then comes the carrot.

243
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,270
That would be...

244
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,850
- the one million.
- Mmm.

245
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,440
- I like details.
- You want them now?

246
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,910
Later.

247
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,180
Well?

248
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,220
I need backup.

249
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,190
How about Tod Stapp?

250
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,150
Yeah, he'll do.

251
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,610
The risk doesn't seem
to bother you much, if any.

252
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,570
It's what I do.
It's what I'm good at.

253
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,040
Besides, I learned the lesson a long time ago
that maximum effort means minimum risk.

254
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,960
How about the lesson
small risk means small profit?

255
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,300
Big risk, big profit.

256
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,920
Never heard of it.

257
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,930
The Agency was always very big on risk,
but not very big on profit.

258
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,150
How about half the Tool Shed?

259
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,570
Who'd own the other half?

260
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,240
Someone willing to share the risk.

261
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,240
And Grimes?

262
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,920
So Grimes goes.

263
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,310
Say it.

264
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,320
Grimes goes.

265
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,330
Well?

266
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,540
I'll think about it.

267
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,280
They're not wired;
They're not carrying.

268
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,280
I can swear to that.

269
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,660
They swear they're not cops, but who knows?

270
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,370
They got names?

271
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,370
Not so as you'd notice.

272
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,920
- Well, I'll call them Mr. X and Mr. Y.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,970
You got business with me, Mr. X, Y?

274
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,010
Private business.

275
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,200
Ahh. Good for my back.

276
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,490
Well?

277
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,830
We buy bad paper, Mr. Birdsong.

278
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,620
Do you, now?
That's interesting.

279
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,130
Any particular kind?

280
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,500
Old debts, outstanding notes.

281
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,510
For instance, say someone owed you-

282
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,550
Oh, say $25,000.

283
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,470
That you'd almost
given up on ever collecting.

284
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,510
We might offer you $15,000 for it.

285
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,730
You want judge Beach's paper, don't you?

286
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,730
I don't believe we know
anyone named Beach...

287
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,320
but if he has some paper out and we buy
it, we probably would get to know him.

288
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,150
- Probably.
- Cash?

289
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,210
Gentlemen, have a cup of tea.

290
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,830
Hello, Mr. Goodwin.
Nice to see you.

291
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,590
That him?

292
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,840
That's him.

293
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,390
Les, mon vieux!

294
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,390
Comment vas-tu? You're looking well!
You mind if we join you?

295
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,440
Before you get upset, take a look inside.

296
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,860
I take it you two
are Mr. X and Mr. Y.

297
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,660
Oh. He talked to Birdsong.

298
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,290
- How much?
- Twelve and a half.

299
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,960
For $20,000 worth of bad checks.

300
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,800
It occurs to me, gentlemen...

301
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,550
that you're not really in
the bad paper buying business.

302
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,340
It occurs to me that you are into
something much more profitable...

303
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,350
in which I might, uh...

304
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,680
let's say, participate.

305
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,610
Do you like pain?

306
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,320
If you do,

307
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,870
I can paralyze your elbow...

308
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,160
and the pain is so excruciating...

309
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,670
that you won't be able
to play bridge for a week.

310
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,000
Maybe two.

311
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,130
Now, Les...

312
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,880
promise me that you won't
butt into our business...

313
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,760
and maybe you and I
can be... friends.

314
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,140
Maybe even...

315
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,190
real good friends.

316
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,400
Okay?

317
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,230
Get your hand off me.

318
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,390
Tell us about the judge's
extracurricular love life, if any.

319
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,760
He's my oldest friend.

320
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,770
- How old?
- My oldest.

321
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,190
We grew up next door to each other;
He was like an elder brother to me.

322
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,820
So any information about his
extracurricular love life, as you call it...

323
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,990
will cost you another thousand.

324
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,870
- Pay him.
- Look in your napkin, Les.

325
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
How did you kn-

326
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,180
Her name's Julie Ames.

327
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,220
Do you know the Queen Charlotte?

328
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,770
Apartment 1402.

329
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,730
His oldest friend, huh?

330
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,900
I have that privilege.

331
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,740
Call me sometime.

332
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,780
We can discuss friends.

333
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,740
Old... and new.

334
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,290
I may do that.

335
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,990
Are you a fisherman, Mr. Crowe?

336
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,740
It's a solitary pursuit, essentially...

337
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,960
but one that provides time
for meditation and reflection.

338
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,250
I was just pondering on
how long the world will last.

339
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,800
The world as we know it, of course.

340
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,090
Mmm. I don't' give it
much more than 20 or 30 years.

341
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,140
By then clean air, clean water,
clean rain and productive soil...

342
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,850
will all be memories.

343
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,190
If, indeed, there are any memories.

344
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,190
Which brings us,
in a rather circuitous fashion...

345
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,940
to Cross Creek versus our
esteemed client Curl Industries.

346
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,780
Cross Creek, of course, is the birthplace
of the Cross Creek babies.

347
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,780
You must've seen them on television.

348
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,040
The ones with leukemia,
no fingers, one eye, et cetera.

349
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,080
Exactly.

350
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,460
The hamlet of Cross Creek...

351
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,170
claims that toxic waste dumped
into their water supply by our client...

352
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,170
caused the deformities.

353
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,340
Do you believe that?

354
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,930
The lower courts did and stuck
your client with a $25 million tag.

355
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,930
Well, true, but now it's up
to the state supreme court...

356
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,890
to decide the right or wrong
of that judgment.

357
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,940
And here we are, just the three of us...

358
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,150
about to suborn a supreme court justice...

359
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,150
into voting against crippled kids.

360
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,070
Does that give you pause, Mr. Crowe?

361
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,120
- Sure.
- But?

362
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,120
No buts. The two of you wanted
to know if it gives me pause; I said yes.

363
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,500
It's a felony.
If I get caught, I go to jail.

364
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,540
That gives me pause, all right?

365
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,050
If it didn't, you wouldn't have me working
for you. - What about the deformed tots?

366
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,260
I suppose I think of them
as often as they think of me.

367
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,440
You'll find one million dollars
in that bag.

368
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,560
Spend it wisely, Mr. Crowe.

369
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,610
Okay. Anything else?

370
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,980
That time in Jordan, in Amman.

371
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,900
Did the Iraqi colonel really get his gold?

372
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,570
He got it.

373
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,200
I do hope so.

374
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,000
He is a nasty piece of work.

375
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,010
Isn't he, though?

376
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,060
You really expect me to sign these?

377
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,230
Sure. I mean, you just turned over all
this money to the federal government...

378
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,900
for which we're extremely grateful.

379
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,400
But now we're gonna turn it back
over to you, and if we're gonna do that...

380
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,070
we're gonna need a receipt.

381
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,160
Because, bearing in mind
that Iraqi colonel...

382
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,070
you might be on the next flight to Rio.

383
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,520
Ah-ah! Both copies, Slick.

384
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,650
It was worth a try.

385
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,910
So what about Maggie
and her plan for a... palace coup?

386
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,120
Was I right, or was I right?

387
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,490
You were half right, as usual.

388
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,540
She won't give me the details
until after I fix the judge.

389
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,710
- What kind of pitch did she make?
- Half for me, half for her.

390
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,710
Well, now.

391
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,090
What does well, now mean?

392
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,800
It means you go the distance with her...

393
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,810
provided you're still interested...

394
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,810
in scrambling back into our grace
and favor and staying out of jail.

395
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,350
This is the last fucking time.
Okay, Smitty? The very last time.

396
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,820
You guys have had me on every shit
detail you can think of for two years...

397
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,820
because of some fucking Iraqi colonel.

398
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,410
He got his gold!
You know goddamn well he did!

399
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,490
Uh-huh. Well, he says he didn't.

400
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,040
After this, I want out.

401
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,040
I want all the way out.

402
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,550
And all we want, Nellie,
is to nail Vic Grimes on bribery...

403
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,550
and acquire his Tool Shed.

404
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,550
So our aims here are identical.

405
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,600
I mean, we get our very own...

406
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,680
private, self-supporting
special operations boutique...

407
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,190
at no cost to the taxpayer, I might add...

408
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,190
and you get...

409
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,020
out.

410
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,030
Where are we, AI?

411
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,070
Two blocks from the Queen Charlotte.

412
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,450
- You want out here?
- Zig-zag a couple more blocks, AI.

413
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,490
You got it.

414
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,830
You, uh, still think somebody's
always on your tail, Nellie?

415
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,870
Not always.
Just sometimes.

416
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,870
Now and then.
You know, Smitty?

417
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
- Thanks, AI.
- Have fun.

418
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,040
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

419
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Are these yours?

420
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,970
Who the hell are you? - Someone
you're gonna have to talk to, Judge.

421
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,300
I thought you'd rather do it here
than at home or in your chambers.

422
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,390
If you're trying to collect on those,
you're wasting your time.

423
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,480
Can we talk now?

424
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,080
Welcome back our champion, Bunny!

425
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,080
Bunny?

426
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Don't I get introduced?

427
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,250
Julie, I think it might be best
if you went for a walk.

428
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,010
W—Well, I don't think so.
This is my house.

429
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,630
She stays.

430
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,990
What's goin' on, Beachie?

431
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
A bribe is being offered.

432
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,540
If I were drowning and somebody
threw me a life preserver...

433
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,580
I wouldn't exactly call that a bribe.

434
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,580
You're drowning in debt, Your Honor.

435
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,130
Another week or so,
it'll be glub, glub, good-bye.

436
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,210
Get out.

437
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,840
There's a million dollars
on that table, tax free.

438
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,930
Leave.

439
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Please.

440
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,230
Birdsong.

441
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,230
I bought your paper from Bobby Birdsong.

442
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,570
I also know a guy at the news who, uh-

443
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,660
Okay, there's no need to go into that,
but it would make a helluva story.

444
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,620
Supreme Court judge In Hock To Bookie?

445
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
What case?

446
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,890
Cross Creek vs. Curl Industries.

447
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,970
You go against the crippled kids.

448
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,150
Well, the rumor is,
the rest of the court is split, 3-3.

449
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,570
If you make it 4-3 in favor of Curl...

450
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,700
you're home free and semi-rich.

451
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,130
Yes or no?

452
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,140
All right.

453
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Yes.

454
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,120
I need a receipt.

455
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,560
She signs too, as a witness.

456
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,900
I-I-I'm not signin' anything.

457
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,900
Sign it, Julie.

458
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,610
What earthly difference can it make?

459
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,750
You must have, uh, very
suspicious employers, Mr., uh-

460
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,300
Whatever it is you call yourself.

461
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,470
Mr. X.

462
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,520
And this...

463
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,520
is just some insurance against
your voting the wrong way...

464
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,230
and then saying,
Money? What money?

465
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,230
Get out of my house.

466
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,820
Sure.

467
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,810
- Could you make me one?
- Sure.

468
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,150
Thank you.

469
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,120
You know what this means?

470
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,170
It means that we have a lock on the judge.

471
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,880
In the trade it's called a forever lock.

472
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,930
Which means we can sell his vote
over and over again...

473
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,260
- and it won't cost us a dime.
- Great.

474
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,770
You don't seem too impressed.

475
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,810
We're not scrupled, surely, Mr. Crowe.

476
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,280
Scruples? No.

477
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,280
Just a growing concern over
the rosy future you painted for us.

478
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,780
The one where all I do is stand in front of
the big window with my back to the room...

479
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,950
while the smooth guys in suits stream
in and out, whispering in my ear.

480
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,420
All I gotta do is keep my eyes on
the distant horizon and nod yes or no.

481
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,590
You remember that?

482
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,220
And a rough translation of that might be,
what do we do about Vic Grimes?

483
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,090
What, when and how.

484
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,140
What's simple.

485
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,180
We kill him.

486
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,770
How? Cleverly enough
to avoid suspicion.

487
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,570
And that just leaves when.

488
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,030
Have you ever killed anyone?

489
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,240
Have you?

490
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,290
Not cleverly.

491
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,290
That's just another word for fancy.

492
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,080
Cyanide in the toothpaste
and crap like that.

493
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,800
See, to do it right,

494
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,420
You work up close.

495
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,430
Close enough to hear 'em beg...

496
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,430
see 'em bleed...

497
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,430
and smell it when they crap in their pants.

498
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,980
Could you do it? Huh?
Could you kill him?

499
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,070
Me? Just me?

500
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,620
Okay. Us.

501
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,870
Bien sur.
Sure. We can do it.

502
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,130
Why not?

503
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,200
Does Grimes trust you?

504
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,710
As much as he trusts anyone.

505
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Ever... slept with him?

506
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,750
Why?

507
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,760
Could you?

508
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,260
Could you?

509
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,720
- Probably.
- That's how we'll do it.

510
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,180
You get him in bed; I'll kill him.

511
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,510
Who invited you?

512
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,800
I got curious.

513
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,680
Guess the judge decided he could use
that million dollars after all, huh?

514
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,310
Really? Wow.

515
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,600
Well, I-I figured he would.

516
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,320
But what I can't figure out is-

517
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,610
Well, is you, Brother Crowe.

518
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,280
Why?

519
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:03,450
At 4:41 this afternoon,
you got out of a large green van...

520
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,710
license number AAB 8990.

521
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,630
Motor vehicles says it's a Hertz rental.

522
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,800
Now, Hertz says
it went out on an Am Ex card...

523
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,970
belonging to one Norman Y. Harris.

524
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:22,310
If memory serves me...

525
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,980
Norman Y. Harris...

526
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,270
is the Agency work name
of William B. Smithfield.

527
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,070
The one he used down in El Salvador...

528
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,110
when I was there.

529
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,280
Old Smitty.

530
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,700
The Agency's all-time champion survivor.

531
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,700
Must be getting careless.

532
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,620
Oh, I don't know.

533
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,420
Maybe he was in a hurry.

534
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,380
Here you are...

535
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,510
working for Vic Grimes...

536
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,510
but still messing around with the Agency.

537
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,100
What kind of hammer
are they holding over you?

538
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,060
10 years? 15?

539
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,060
Something like that.

540
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,610
Well, my first reaction...

541
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,610
was to race back to the Tool Shed
before my shirttail hit my fanny...

542
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,240
score some points with Grimes...

543
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,080
tell him all about you and old Bill.

544
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,960
- But you didn't.
- Not yet.

545
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,840
- Pourquoi pas?
- I smell money.

546
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,800
Not upper-middle—class folks' money;
I mean rich folks' money.

547
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,340
I want some of it.

548
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,350
Oh. I tell a lie.
I want a lot of it.

549
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,690
It's a takeover.

550
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:58,070
Keep talkin'.

551
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:03,280
The Agency wants their own off-the-books,
self-financed black operations boutique.

552
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,240
A going concern with
no chance of trace-back.

553
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,750
Someone who'll handle the shit work:

554
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,790
The snatches, the, uh, blackmail.

555
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,710
Who knows, maybe even the wet work.

556
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,710
In short, the Agency wants the Tool Shed.

557
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,260
Who'll head it up?

558
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,310
Margaret and I will run it.

559
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,810
You...

560
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,900
Hmm.

561
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,230
I guess that makes you number three.

562
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,360
What about Grimes?

563
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,490
What do you care?

564
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,700
You're right.

565
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,830
What do I care?

566
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,750
And not only did judge Beach
sign the receipt for one million...

567
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:59,010
but Julie Ames also signed it as a witness.

568
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,050
How very neat and tidy.

569
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,090
You have the receipt, of course.

570
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,140
Of course.

571
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,890
And you're absolutely certain
it's the original and not a photocopy?

572
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,900
What's bothering you, Vic?

573
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,240
I asked what was bothering you.

574
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,830
Mr. Crowe.

575
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,120
It's all gone so smoothly.

576
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,630
Here we have a judge safely bribed;
We even have a receipt to prove it.

577
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:44,590
It's Friday, and on Monday a supreme court
decision is going to be handed down...

578
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,850
in favor of our principal client.

579
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,890
Absolute perfection.

580
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,100
Something I long ago learned to distrust.

581
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,190
Okay.

582
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,280
What else?

583
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,820
Ruth giving you a hard time at home?

584
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,870
As a matter of fact...

585
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,790
my wife is spending the week
with her sister in Minneapolis.

586
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,120
- I'll be alone for the weekend at the cabin.
- Oh.

587
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,750
- Like me to come along?
- Yes.

588
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,800
I was hoping you'd be free.

589
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,810
And maybe this time I can even teach you
a little something about fishing.

590
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,520
I don't want to fish.

591
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,640
I want to fuck.

592
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,400
Oh, well.

593
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,820
There's nothing I can teach you
in that department.

594
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,360
Thank you", she simpered.

595
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,070
Well, well. Toddie dearest.

596
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:10,530
- AI.
- This should be interesting.

597
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,460
- What the fuck's he doin' here?
- Cut himself in.

598
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,590
Sorry, Stapp.
No faggots allowed.

599
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:34,390
- I mean, you are still a faggot, aren't you?
- Of course, Bill.

600
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:38,720
Well, I guess you'll have to go see Grimes,
give him a full report-

601
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,640
- Tell him all about-
- just a minute. Just a goddamn minute.

602
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,950
What did he do, spill his guts?

603
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,530
- Just the usual pillow talk.
- Answer the goddamn question.

604
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,540
Look, Smitty.

605
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,120
You got dumb-fuck careless.

606
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,290
You rented that van
under your old work name.

607
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:13,260
After that, I did my adds and take-aways
and came up with an interesting total.

608
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,720
Either you cut me in...

609
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,350
or I go see what Grimes has to offer.

610
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,870
See what I mean, AI? These faggots'll
fuck you over every time.

611
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,830
Jesus, cut him in, Smitty.
You don't have any choice.

612
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,670
Okay. You work with Crowe.

613
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,340
Swell. Now that
that's settled, what's next?

614
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,720
Well, next we're gonna create
a little crisis in the Tool Shed by, uh...

615
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,930
causing Vic Grimes to lose his
bread-and-butter client, Curl Industries.

616
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,440
How? - Me, you turned
judge Beach around before.

617
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,940
Just turn him back around.

618
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,030
Make sure he votes against Curl and, uh...

619
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,360
for Cross Creek and the crippled kids.

620
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,200
- You like it?
- Oh, very much.

621
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,540
Then do it.
And take her with you.

622
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,630
Bill. AI.

623
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,930
- Well?
- We do nothing. The judge stays fixed.

624
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,930
H ow?

625
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,100
- The one million from Curl Industries.
- The bribe money?

626
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,230
Yeah, Smitty was afraid I'd skip to Rio
with it, so he made me give it to him.

627
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,650
Before he gave it back,
he made me sign two receipts.

628
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:56,360
- Scotch and soda.
- Two.

629
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,410
Even Smitty wasn't dumb enough
to let you keep a copy.

630
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,080
No, but, uh...

631
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,080
better than that, I did get it on tape.

632
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,420
Sounds to me like evidence
that federal money bribed a judge.

633
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,460
Exactly. It also means that even if Smitty's
got his fist wrapped around me...

634
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,510
I got mine wrapped around him.

635
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,630
It's a wash.

636
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,810
Might work.

637
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,520
Depending on what my cut is.

638
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,020
Well, your cut stays the same:

639
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,400
Money, power...

640
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,070
the love of someone very beautiful.

641
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,450
Oh, Beachie.

642
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,830
Wait 'til you see what else I bought.

643
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,550
Julie, we have to talk first.

644
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,760
About what?

645
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,800
About this.

646
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,020
The Bahamas?

647
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,030
Oh, my God! Oh, Beachie,
how I've wanted to go there!

648
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,780
When do we leave?

649
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,410
- You leave this afternoon, by yourself.
- What?

650
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:31,620
Now wait a minute. Please,
j-j-just listen to me, all right?

651
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:35,000
I want you to take the money...

652
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:41,010
and open an account in your name...

653
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,260
with this man at this bank.

654
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,640
- In my name?
- Mm-hmm.

655
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,360
That means you're leavin' her.

656
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,360
Yes.

657
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,200
- When?
- Very soon.

658
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,910
So, I just wait for you there?

659
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,620
- In Nassau?
- In Nassau.

660
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,760
- You trust me that much, huh?
- Oh, Julie.

661
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:25,640
It's not about trust.
It's about love.

662
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,930
Beachie, I love you so much.

663
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,520
- Oh.
- And I'm gonna make you so fuckin' happy.

664
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,780
You already have.

665
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,610
How say you now, gentlemen?

666
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,930
You know why I hate Grimes?

667
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,480
Probably because you owe him too much.

668
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,650
Your only choices are hate and gratitude.
Who wants to be grateful?

669
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:47,030
Exactly.

670
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:50,700
That's good, 'cause when this starts-

671
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,670
Yeah, it's Margaret.

672
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,130
Yeah, just give me 30 minutes.
All right, fine.

673
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,640
That was Grimes.

674
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,720
It seems judge Beach shot
and killed himself half an hour ago.

675
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:22,100
Grimes and I have to go see Curl,
calm him down, reassure him.

676
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,400
After that, we'll go up to the cabin
for the weekend.

677
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,400
To fish and fuck.

678
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,740
- We do this tomorrow, right?
- Yeah, all right.

679
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,790
Tomorrow.

680
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,270
Beachie?

681
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,320
What kind of detective?

682
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,360
Where the wood's stained, here
on the bookcase. - Homicide.

683
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,370
Who is this?

684
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,290
They're going to arrest me
and put me in prison.

685
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,670
There's no way I'll be able to survive that.
There's no way I can get out-

686
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,710
Shut up, Walter.

687
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,840
- He's dead, you know.
- I know.

688
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,310
- Judge Beach killed himself.
- know that.

689
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:24,520
Now it will all come out.
They'll find out about it.

690
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,560
- You want me to try?
- Go on.

691
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,730
Walter, Walter, Walter.
I'm going to talk to you very simply...

692
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,320
and slowly, and I want you to concentrate.

693
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,490
Okay? Now sit down.

694
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:44,410
The court decision is still going to be
handed down on Monday. Do you understand?

695
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,790
Okay. Now that means
it's already been voted.

696
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,590
Already written.
Do you follow that?

697
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:58,260
It means you've won, Walter.
It means the court made its decision...

698
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,260
before Beach died.

699
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,600
And that decision will stand.

700
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,310
- We've won?
- Of course we won.

701
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,350
But I don't understand.

702
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,230
Why would he kill himself
after we gave him all that money?

703
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:19,110
- Maybe he had principles, Walter.
- Principles?

704
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,620
Maybe he had cancer,
Walter, cancer of the esophagus.

705
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:27,290
Oh, yes, of course. People often do that
when they have cancer.

706
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:31,250
- H-how do you know it was the esophagus?
- We don't know for sure.

707
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,380
If you don't know that, how do you know
which way he voted then?

708
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,970
Walter, look at us.

709
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,050
You look like something
out of LL. Bean.

710
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:43,430
We're going fishing. Do you think if
anything was wrong, we'd be going fishing?

711
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,470
Back to bed, Walter.

712
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,940
A nice rhythm now.
All right now, level.

713
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,600
- Come on. See?
- Mm-hmm. My turn?

714
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,690
- Yeah, your turn.
- Okay.

715
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,360
Let me see you work that rod, woman.

716
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,450
You know, Julie Ames
is gonna be a problem for us.

717
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,330
I'll get Stapp to take care of her.

718
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,790
- One more time.
- What are the numbers?

719
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,290
Eleven to one.
Twelve is right above your head.

720
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,630
- Do they have any meaning?
- Yeah, 11 is slightly behind 12.

721
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,840
One o'clock.
You're going from 11:00 to 1:00.

722
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,470
Twelve is directly above your head.
Eleven is slightly behind.

723
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,520
Shorter stroke when you come up.

724
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,100
Tighter. Don't go so far back.
Keep your wrist straight.

725
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:33,150
- Oh, that's not so bad. Watch.
- All right, stop.

726
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,480
- You had enough?
- Enough fishing, yes.

727
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,460
Wait. Shh.

728
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,060
Just wait there.

729
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,690
Behind you, Vic.

730
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:39,830
Like I said, you gotta work up close.

731
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:37,050
You know what he said?

732
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,850
No. What?

733
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,980
What?

734
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,200
Oh. He said he loved me.

735
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,320
So what? So do I.

736
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,720
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

737
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,470
Come on, come on.

738
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,940
Okay now. Okay.

739
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:34,130
Dr. Cole, 2023.

740
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,550
Dr. Cole, 2023.

741
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,310
Why does the nurse have to push you?

742
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,520
It's just a regulation.
She'll be here in a minute.

743
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,030
Ms. Wells' room.

744
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,580
Oh, hi, Jane. What's up?

745
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,460
All right.

746
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,340
I'll tell her.

747
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,970
We're fucked.

748
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,550
Jane says the state supreme court...

749
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,270
just upheld the $25 million
judgment against Curl.

750
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,310
The vote was four to three.

751
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,310
Get the door.

752
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,840
Oh. Oh!

753
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,020
Get him up.

754
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,650
You like pain?

755
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,940
Then I suggest you get up...

756
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:22,990
or you'll feel pain
like you've never felt before.

757
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,410
- Here.
- No, don't touch me.

758
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,450
Grown men don't touch each other.

759
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,870
What happened?

760
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,880
Oh, I had an accident.

761
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,170
What do you want from me, Margaret?
Grimes is dead.

762
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:46,590
That lying judge swindled me out of my
money and then killed himself out of spite.

763
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:48,590
That's over. Gone. Finished.

764
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:53,390
What I want is to Keep you out of
jail, Walter. - Jail? What for?

765
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:57,190
- Bribery.
- The money that bribed the judge-

766
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:00,440
your money-is still out there.

767
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,480
Somebody has it...

768
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:05,450
somebody who knows the whole story...

769
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,820
and can either blow the whistle on you or-

770
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,240
Blackmail me.

771
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,860
Well, you've got to stop him, Margaret.
You've got to fix it so...

772
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,330
It's not a him. "It's a her."

773
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:17,920
Julie Ames, Judge Beach's girlfriend.

774
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,080
Well, then, stop her, goddamn it.

775
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:22,840
You mean kill her, Mr. Curl?

776
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:27,510
- Who is this person?
- The man who can stop Julie Ames.

777
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,890
Well, then do it!

778
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:43,520
We have to settle on a price first.

779
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,970
- Help you, sir?
- Apartment 931.

780
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,780
There's one thing I know

781
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:32,530
We never felt this way-

782
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,330
Until I met you

783
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:41,170
I'll give you five good reasons

784
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:48,800
You're so good

785
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,510
When it comes down to understandin'

786
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,810
- Hello, Les. Come on in.
- Thank you.

787
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:58,310
- Thank you for coming so early.
- Not at all.

788
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:01,230
I thought we'd talk while I finish shaving.
Is that all right with you?

789
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:05,730
- How intimate.
- You're the one I pray for,

790
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:09,570
In the night-

791
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,610
- And how cozy.
- Thank you.

792
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,490
- The anti-couch-potato room, I take it.
- Something like that.

793
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:21,410
Do you have it just about
the way you want it?

794
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,420
Just about.

795
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:42,060
You said on the phone you had some information
about, uh, judge Beach's girlfriend.

796
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:44,650
What was her name?
Julie Ames?

797
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,070
- She's traveling in Europe.
- Mm-hmm.

798
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,990
Working out her grief, I expect.

799
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:54,410
I received a card from her only yesterday.

800
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,410
Showed her in Brussels, of all places.

801
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:01,950
In front of the statue of that
perpetually pissing little boy.

802
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,000
Care to see it?

803
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,630
Sure. Why not?

804
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,470
May I keep it?

805
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:20,180
- Whatever for?
- I think she's cute.

806
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:38,910
For your trouble.

807
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,080
No trouble at all.

808
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:10,860
Ms. Well's office.

809
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:13,820
One moment.
She's expecting you.

810
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,000
Sorry I'm late.

811
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,220
It's not a problem.
We only have one item to discuss.

812
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,220
Make it two.

813
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:43,180
All right, two.
I spoke to Homicide today.

814
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:48,100
And? - They still have no leads except
for my description of the killer.

815
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:51,020
Mid-forties.
Stocky. Thinning hair.

816
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,610
That's too bad.

817
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,200
- My turn?
- Mmm.

818
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:04,450
Miss Julie Ames, Brussels.

819
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:07,960
- Where'd you get this?
- I bought it from one of my sources.

820
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:14,420
- What's she doing in Brussels?
- Working out her grief, I'm told.

821
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,380
Too scared to come home. Probably
too scared to be of any problem to us.

822
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,930
Brussels today, Berlin tomorrow.

823
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,970
Rome on Friday, if the weather's nice.
Who knows?

824
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:27,270
Find her.
Find her; Then kill her.

825
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:33,940
You really get off
on saying that, don't you?

826
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,030
If you won't do it,
I'll find somebody who will.

827
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,740
- Why don't we talk about that tonight?
- I'm busy tonight.

828
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:50,920
Busy? What does busy mean?

829
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:57,710
Busy " means I'm entertaining clients. Busy"
means I'm not somebody's bimbo-in-waiting.

830
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:03,340
You're right, Margaret.
You're no bimbo.

831
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,680
You're top shelf, the girl of my dreams.

832
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,230
Because if you're not...

833
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:14,900
then nothing we've done
makes any fucking sense, does it?

834
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,150
Are you finished?

835
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,780
I have a final prediction.

836
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:26,660
You and I are forever.
I decide when forever ends.

837
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,130
Get out.

838
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,650
It's Les. Shall I come up?

839
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:28,630
Did you get what I wanted?

840
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,270
Yes, but I'm afraid it's a bit expensive.

841
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:34,270
Well, golly, Les, what a surprise.

842
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:38,140
- How much?
- $2,000.

843
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:41,070
Bullshit. $1,500.

844
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,820
Sorry, Julie.

845
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,920
- Is it loaded?
- Of course.

846
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,420
But I better show you how to use it.

847
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:09,760
This is the safety.
This is on.

848
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:14,230
This is off.
When the safety's on, it won't fire.

849
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:17,680
This is the slide.
To fire the first time...

850
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:19,980
you pull it back like this.

851
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,030
That puts a round up the spout.

852
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,490
- Is there one in there now?
- Yes.

853
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,040
Then I'm all set.

854
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:36,540
I just make sure the safety's off...

855
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,840
point it...

856
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,510
and start pullin' the trigger, right?

857
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,550
Right.

858
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:50,720
How many times can I pull it?

859
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,850
Seven.

860
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:57,940
But it's a semiautomatic,
so it ejects its shell casings.

861
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:03,520
Once you fire it, I suggest
you gather up the casings.

862
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:07,570
Neatness counts. Then, too,
the police set great store...

863
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:09,570
by shell casings.

864
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,240
Mm-hmm.

865
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:18,960
- $1,500, right?
- The weapon is $1,500.

866
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But it won't do you much good
without the other item.

867
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:26,670
All right, Les.
Who is he and where do I find him?

868
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,840
I did say cash, didn't I?

869
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,970
Forgetful me.

870
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,690
- Nelson Crowe.
- He's Mr. X?

871
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,690
Yes.

872
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,920
- I couldn't stop them.
- That's all right.

873
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,250
Go on. Get out.

874
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,260
My God, if you don't look flush, Maggie.

875
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:16,430
What do you want, Smitty?

876
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,390
You remember AI here?

877
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,600
- How are you, Maggie?
- AI.

878
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,570
I repeat my question.
What do you want?

879
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:33,280
Oh, we want it all, Maggie.

880
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,410
Everything.

881
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:38,910
See, we got you cold on
bribery and conspiracy.

882
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:43,330
You remember a little old
Tennessee gal named Julie Ames?

883
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,750
Well, when we find her...

884
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,590
and you can bet your ass we will...

885
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:53,800
she's gonna be our key witness.

886
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
And if that's not good enough...

887
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:58,810
then there's the sad death of Vic Grimes.

888
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:02,810
Poor old Vic. We might even have
to bring the Feebies in on that one...

889
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:07,230
seeing as how Vic had his civil rights
somewhat violated.

890
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:09,820
Make your point.

891
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:12,360
Gee, I thought I made my point.

892
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:21,620
We take over, and you run it...

893
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:24,790
the way we want it run
and where we want it run.

894
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:30,000
It'll be just like old times, Maggie.
You'll be workin' for us.

895
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,880
Course, if you don't wanna do that,
you can do 15 to 20.

896
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:38,010
Maybe even life.

897
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,280
Anything else?

898
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,450
Anything else, AI?

899
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:08,130
- Personnel.
- Personnel.

900
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,840
There will be some personnel changes.

901
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,380
I'll come on as chairman of the board.

902
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:27,390
And you can be the president.

903
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,520
Ah, but Nellie Crowe.

904
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:36,200
Nellie's gonna have to be
our first casualty.

905
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,990
I don't know. Maybe we can put
a little plaque up to him or something.

906
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:44,080
But I'm gonna leave
all that up to you, Maggie.

907
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:47,750
You understand?

908
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:51,250
Mmm. - We're in sort of a
hurry on the Crowe thing.

909
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,380
So now AI and I are gonna take a little
tour, and then, uh, I'll come back...

910
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,470
and maybe you can, uh,
introduce us to everybody.

911
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,390
Love it.

912
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,070
- Get my car up.
- Right away.

913
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,870
You really expect me to sign this?

914
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:27,410
Sure. I mean, you just turned all
this money over to the federal government...

915
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,710
for which we're extremely grateful.

916
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:32,080
But now we're gonna
turn it back over to you.

917
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:34,960
If we're gonna do that,
we're gonna need a receipt.

918
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,000
Excuse me?

919
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,160
Could you hold that for me, please?

920
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,210
Thank you.

921
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,190
- Floor?
- Seven, please.

922
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:01,260
What a lovely suit. Paris.

923
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,260
- Milan.
- Oh.

924
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:42,510
After that, I did my adds and take-ways...

925
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,720
and came up with an interesting total.

926
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,350
Now either you cut me in, or I go
see what Grimes...

927
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:10,490
You're about to have a visitor.
Ms. Julie Ames.

928
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:12,540
Of Brussels.

929
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:46,280
- Remember me?
- Sure. Um, Julie Ames.

930
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,660
Uh, come on in.

931
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,030
Are you alone?
I'm not disturbin' anything?

932
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:55,080
All alone.

933
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:05,380
Hey-

934
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,510
Now that's pretty neat.

935
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:16,890
If you wanna watch the soaps, you gotta row
an hour or do 30 miles on the bike, huh?

936
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,730
You're not really Mr. X
after all, are you?

937
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,650
Turns out you're Nelson Crowe.

938
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:32,570
And you used to be a secret agent man.

939
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,500
You've been busy.

940
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,540
I got curious...

941
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:45,710
after Beachie and all.

942
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,720
Well, you're looking well, Julie.
Very prosperous.

943
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,350
I'm still a little sad about Beachie.

944
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:00,850
Mmm.

945
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:02,840
I'm sorry.

946
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:05,980
I know it must have come
as quite a shock to you.

947
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:16,450
Can I offer you a drink?

948
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,660
Do I get to sit on the bike?

949
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,920
We'll have it in the kitchen.

950
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,210
That's where my daddy did
all his serious drinkin'.

951
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:31,420
In the kitchen.

952
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:57,830
So, that's what you do for a livin', huh?

953
01:37:57,910 --> 01:38:01,370
Fuck up other people's lives?

954
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:04,710
That's not exactly how I like
to think of my job description, Julie.

955
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,920
It's not, huh?

956
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,590
What about Beachie?

957
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,600
He was no saint...

958
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,350
but you might as well have put a gun
to his head and pulled the trigger.

959
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:26,900
Beachie was all wrong
for that kind of scene.

960
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,280
Somebody should've stepped in.

961
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,990
Done somethin'.

962
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:39,200
And I've about decided...

963
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,250
that somebody should've been me.

964
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:49,040
And you want someone to pay.
Is that it, Miss Ames?

965
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,880
Yeah, that's it.

966
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,090
I presume you brought
a weapon of some kind.

967
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:58,300
Who the fuck is she?

968
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:00,810
She's my boss.

969
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:03,890
- So why is she pointin' a gun at your head?
- I don't know.

970
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,980
Why don't you ask her?

971
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:10,900
- Well, boss lady?
- You did bring a gun, didn't you?

972
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:13,690
Yeah. For protection.

973
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:16,450
Okay, then, take it out...

974
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:19,370
and aim it at Mr. Crowe, please.

975
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:26,920
- Why?
- So you can shoot him with safety.

976
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:32,800
Do it!

977
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,810
So he works for you, huh?

978
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:52,230
Not anymore.

979
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,370
But she told you what to do, right?

980
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,370
You bet, Julie.

981
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,380
Every single step.

982
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:32,600
Okay, you work with Crowe.

983
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:36,850
Swell. Now that
that's settled, what's next?

984
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:39,820
Well, next we're gonna
create a little crisis in the Tool Shed...

985
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:44,490
by, uh, causing Vic Grimes to lose
his bread-and-butter client...

986
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,780
Curl Industries.

987
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:49,740
How? - You
turned judge Beach around before.

988
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,790
Just turn him back around.

989
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:58,620
Make sure he votes against Curl
and, uh, for Cross Creek...

990
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,800
and the crippled kids.

991
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:04,220
- You like it?
- Oh, very much.

992
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,220
Then do it.

993
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:31,050
The US. Attorney's office
is almost across the street.

994
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:35,060
If you send this airborne express, it'll
have to go all the way to Ohio and back.

995
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:37,730
Just send it.
