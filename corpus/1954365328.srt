that every person on earth

I mean, it's fucking brutal.

1251
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,569
I feel so stupid

You are.

give that brilliant mind and soul

to a very lucky woman.

I just don't know what that means.

1263
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,520
Well, it means you have
to listen and share,

1264
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,357
which is two things
that you suck at.

1265
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,941
I know I'm not the best listener,

1266
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,610

off the Williamsburg Bridge?

Do you remember?

01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,308
The whole sky was glowing.

1281
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,353
It was like some
watercolor painting.

1282
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,397
All the New Yorkers were smiling,

1283
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,399

15 of these days a year,

There was a light breeze,
