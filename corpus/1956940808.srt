00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>New York...</i>

2
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,896
<i>...are you ready?</i>

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,231
<i>Please welcome...</i>

4
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:28,695
<i>Michelle Buteau!</i>

5
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,652
Yeah!

6
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,373
Oh, my God!

7
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:28,213
New York City!

8
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,255
Oh!

9
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,220
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,680
I am here for you!

11
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,057
I am here...

12
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,725
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,854
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

14
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,942
Whoo!

15
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,152
Yes!

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,363
Yes!

17
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,118
Everybody looking like a snack!
Oh!

18
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,746
Don't do it. Don't do it.

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,164
Don't you dare do it.

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,085
Don't turn me into Octavia Spencer
in every movie.

21
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,049
But you is special, you is kind.
Thank you for coming.

22
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,887
Ooh, can I tell you,
I just wrapped a movie with J.Lo. What?

23
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,686
J.Lo? Excuse me?
She is beautiful. Are you kidding me?

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,896
She is... I couldn't stop staring at her.

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,565
I was like, "Oh, my line..."

26
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,237
She's like an athlete that can dance,
that's a businesswoman in a tank top.

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,407
I say, "Yes, you go with your good knees
and edges, J.Lo!"

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,620
The hardest part of working with J.Lo

29
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,331
is pretending that I didn't know
everything about her.

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,714
I know everything about J.Lo.

31
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,010
For example,
I know that we have the same birthday.

32
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,513
Yes, July 24th.

33
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,849
But I didn't want to tell her
the first day

34
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,932
because I don't want to be the creepy girl
on the set, you know what I mean?

35
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,730
But there's always somebody at the office
that's into astrology,

36
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,025
you know who you are...

37
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,278
Always worried about the sun and the moon,
never your taxes.

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,910
So we had one of those assholes on set.
I said, "Okay...

39
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,412
I'm going to wait for my moment."

40
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,541
And, sure enough, three weeks later,
he goes, "Uh!

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,960
You and Jen have the same face
'cause you're both Leos."

42
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,253
I said, "Oh!"

43
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,423
"This is my moment."

44
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,259
So, I said, "Jen!

45
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,094
You a Leo?"

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,192
She said, "Yes!"
I said, "Jen, I'm a Leo!"

47
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,277
She said, "Stop."
I said, "I will not."

48
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,865
"That's so crazy."

49
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,201
I said, "Jen, when's your birthday?"

50
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,917
Yo, I was so good at this,
Meryl Streep would be like,

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,420
"Give that bitch the Oscar, okay?
Just give the bitch the Oscar."

52
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,218
So I said,
"Jen, my birthday is July 24th."

53
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,719
She said, "What?"

54
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,513
She said, "No!" I said, "Yes!"

55
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,075
She said, "Your birthday's July 24?"

56
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,851
I said, "Isn't that crazy?"
She said, "No one has my birthday."

57
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,854
I said, "I know, it's so special."

58
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,943
I said, "Jen, we should have
a joint birthday party."

59
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,114
And then she walked away...

60
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,159
...didn't talk to me
for, like, three hours...

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,287
That's okay. She came back.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,914
You know, I got big tits, freckles,
big hair. It's friendly.

63
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,457
People are like, "Let's talk to it."

64
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,966
True!

65
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,345
So she came back and she wanted
to, like, spill the tea, you know?

66
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,639
She was like, "Oh, man,
have you ever dated a Leo?"

67
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,433
I said, "Where we going with this, Jen?"

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,271
I said, "Where we going?"

69
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,650
She's like, "No, have you ever dated a Leo
'cause they're, like, so difficult?"

70
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,029
I said, "Oh, honey, I done fucked
the whole zodiac calendar!"

71
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,949
No one plays the lotto once,
you know what I mean?

72
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,703
You don't learn how to ride a bike
the first time.

73
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,831
I said, "Yeah, all that."

74
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,625
She was like,
"Uh, I was engaged to a Leo."

75
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,169
I was like, "Really?"

76
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,676
"That's so crazy."

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,387
Yeah, she's like,
"It wasn't the easiest with Ben."

78
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,972
I said, "Ben who?"

79
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,477
"Benjamin Button?

80
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,564
Benjamin Franklin? Who the Ben?"

81
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,155
And she's like, "I'm so happy now, though,

82
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,990
'cause I'm engaged to a Leo,
but he's great.

83
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,950
He's an athlete, he's Dominican..."

84
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,827
I said, "Ooh, that sounds spicy."

85
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,044
It has been such a beautiful time for me.
You know what I mean?

86
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,713
I feel like I can't complain,
but I love to.

87
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,343
I do. I feel like I cannot complain
but I love to.

88
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,011
And I have so many pet peeves.

89
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,390
The older you get, no one tells you,
your pet peeves get stronger and...

90
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,100
I feel like Tom Petty right now.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,937
I can't... I'm in my 40s right now.
I know, I look so good.

92
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,441
Seriously.

93
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,778
I mean, you gotta celebrate your age.

94
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,198
Real talk, 'cause black don't crack
and beige don't age.

95
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,783
Yes, Prince, thank you.

96
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,666
And I just cannot... cannot stand certain
motherfuckers that do crazy things.

97
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,752
I cannot stand an adult in their 40s,
50s, whatever,

98
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,423
that leave their home
with a pillow from their bedroom

99
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,592
and take that shit to the airport...

100
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,308
...and sleep on the plane.

101
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,603
What is wrong with you,
you weak, weak bitch?

102
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,147
Unfollow me,

103
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,898
delete, we're done.

104
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,902
What, you're 45 years old
and you need your blankey? I can't!

105
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,406
I cannot.

106
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,908
The whole show is my pet peeves,
by the way.

107
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,888
I swear to God, this Asian dude's
gonna leave and be like,

108
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,331
"Raven-Symoné was so angry.
I don't get it.

109
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,708
Oh.

110
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,710
That is not So Raven.

111
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,129
Why is she so angry?"

112
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,098
I'm kidding.
He gonna leave here and be like,

113
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,800
"Nicole Byer looks different."

114
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,058
I cannot stand...

115
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,976
adults...

116
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,021
who fall all the time.

117
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,525
You know who you are if you're a faller.

118
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,821
You fall all the time.

119
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,783
And you make a meal out of this shit.

120
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,038
Like you're the only person
who's ever fucking fell.

121
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,375
"I just fell!"
"I see you, bitch.

122
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,962
Get up." "Is anyone looking?"

123
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,631
"Nobody's looking.

124
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,592
They're walking around you right now."

125
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,803
"Oh, my God, don't take a video!"

126
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,972
"Not Boomerang-worthy, bitch, please...

127
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,599
get up!"

128
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,393
Let me tell you something.
I am a faller, okay?

129
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,146
I fall all the time.

130
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,023
Look at my body, okay?

131
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,609
I have not seen my feet
since the 7th grade.

132
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,947
These tits, it's like a fleshy IKEA shelf.

133
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,243
Truly, I cannot see my feet.

134
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,120
My whole body is shaped
like a drumstick emoji.

135
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,041
You see this shit?

136
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,506
It's a drumstick emoji!

137
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,885
For real. She meaty on top,
nubby on the bottom, fucking delicious.

138
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,687
But, for real, I fall all the time.

139
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,565
You know what I do?
I fucking army crawl my way back up,

140
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,567
'cause I'm a woman.

141
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:32,029
My ankles are so teeny tiny
and so cute and so white,

142
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,408
if you just saw a picture of my ankles,
you'd be like,

143
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,993
"Who dat skinny white girl?"

144
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,955
It me!

145
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,251
It me. If you saw a picture of my ankles,
they are so skinny and so white...

146
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,355
- How skinny and white are they?
- How skinny and white are they?

147
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,258
If you just saw my ankles, you'd be like,

148
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,636
"Ooh, that white girl gotta go to Montauk
and name her boat right now."

149
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,481
I fall all the time.

150
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,941
I was just on the set of...

151
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,943
...another movie, um...

152
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,784
Oh, my God. You guys!

153
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,412
You guys!

154
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,754
So I had the last...
The last, like, line of the last scene,

155
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,597
like, the last week.
It was a very long week,

156
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,424
and I turned around

157
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,718
after I said my line,
I didn't see the camera.

158
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,387
The camera was so close
that I headbutted it.

159
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,015
That's how close the camera was.

160
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,077
No, truly, I said my line, I was like,
"Okay, everybody, have a good night."

161
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,227
And I turned around

162
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,564
and I hit that shit so hard,
it looked like I did it on purpose.

163
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,818
Like, I hit it and I was like,
"Ow, karma, why you hit me so hard?"

164
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,072
And I was about to fall down

165
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,875
and this is something that happens
in your 40s that nobody tells you:

166
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,826
you think about
how you're going to fall.

167
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,789
You think about how you're gonna fall.

168
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,166
I said, "Girl, how you gonna fall?"

169
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,299
I said, "I don't know, girl."

170
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,681
I said, "Girl, we gonna fall on face?"

171
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,725
I'm like, "No, girl.

172
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,769
You're gonna chip your tooth...

173
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,313
and a chipped tooth,

174
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,065
freckles and big titties?

175
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,359
That's too much character."

176
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,574
"We don't need all that character."

177
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,164
So I was like, "Girl, what we gonna do?
We gonna fall on hands?

178
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,417
Fall on your hands,
it's the most natural reaction."

179
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Stop!

180
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,545
Stop the fall. Stop.

181
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,380
You better stop this fall.

182
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,258
And then I said, "No, girl,

183
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,176
don't fall on your hands.

184
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,137
You're gonna break your wrist.

185
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,682
If you break your wrist,
who gonna wipe your ass?"

186
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,313
I know you guys are thinking
I'm making so much money

187
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,108
in this borrowed
gold sequins plus-sized suit.

188
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,157
But I don't have ass-wiping money, okay?

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,783
Yet. I got goals!

190
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,205
Who gonna wipe my ass, my husband?

191
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,041
I love him, he love me.
He ain't gonna wipe my ass.

192
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,586
He is not gonna wipe my ass, okay?

193
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,921
I can't even fart
in front of my husband.

194
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,133
And it's not up to him. It's up to me.
I don't want to fart in front of him.

195
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,135
We been married ten years. It's lovely.

196
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,928
I'm not gonna fart in front of him. No.

197
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,848
Uh-uh. Would you eat
in a restaurant that's dirty?

198
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,740
You guys.

199
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,991
My husband's so cute.

200
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,828
He's so sweet.

201
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,307
He's from Holland,
but he calls it the Netherlands. I'm like,

202
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,451
"Boo-boo, you gotta pick a name.
We don't give a fuck.

203
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,752
Okay? We don't care."

204
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,838
Holland, that's like Germany Light.
We don't know where that is.

205
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,882
We don't know where Holland is.

206
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,010
You do not know where Holland is.
Don't act like you know.

207
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,096
Excuse me. Case in point,
one time I was in Amsterdam...

208
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,598
Amsterdam, that's right.

209
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,186
And my friend came to visit me.

210
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,272
She got on a plane from New York
to Amsterdam...

211
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,571
...went through customs,

212
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,907
got out the airport,
looked around and was like,

213
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,285
"Damn, Denmark is so beautiful
this time of year."

214
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,748
We don't know where Holland is, okay?

215
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,749
We don't.

216
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,838
And my husband, he's so cute.
He has the most Dutch name ever.

217
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,840
It's like first testament type shit.

218
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,676
It's spelled G-I-J-S
and it's pronounced...

219
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,052
<i>"Hhhiyce."</i>

220
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,306
You could feel sorry for me, and...

221
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,352
The Dutch G doesn't exist
in the English language

222
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,773
and it never means anything to me
in America until we get to Holland,

223
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,150
AKA the Netherlands, AKA Germany Light.

224
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,612
'Cause I forget. I forget.

225
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,614
Like, I was out one night in Amsterdam,

226
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,115
and...

227
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,703
I was ordering some cheese and crackers,
a little charcuterie plate,

228
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
you know, she cute.

229
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Classy.

230
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,211
And so I told the waitress, I was like,
"I'd like some brie,

231
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,838
I like some Gouda..."

232
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,882
And she goes, "You mean, <i>hhow-da?"</i>

233
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,302
I said, "Why you do that?"

234
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,766
"That's not nice."

235
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,644
I said, "I don't want it no more.

236
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,397
<i>Hhow'd</i> you do that?"

237
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,947
Those Dutch people
are about correcting you, honey.

238
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,283
They love correcting you.
I'm like, "Look,

239
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,911
I'll learn Dutch when I can make
more money speaking Dutch."

240
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,960
It's a plan. She got plans.

241
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,671
But thank you, white girls be snapping.
I love...

242
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,799
woke white people.
Yes, this is my town hall.

243
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,092
Thank you so much.

244
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,886
Yes.

245
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,930
Let's get to the issues at hand.

246
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:39,104
I love her. Cute little white girl
in the back, "Yes, sister. Yes, sis.

247
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,814
Speak on it, sis."

248
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,946
I'll see you on TikTok.

249
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,492
"I speak your language."

250
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,746
So one of my favorite things
to do in Amsterdam is...

251
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,667
get a little high. Not too high.
Bitch doesn't need to be flying.

252
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,753
Get a little high and go to museums.

253
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,339
Not for very long, like 40 minutes.

254
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,675
You know what I mean?
Too long feels like a class.

255
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,093
I'm like, "Hurry up."

256
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,058
And so one time I was in Amsterdam
and I saw the Van Gogh Museum.

257
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,478
I was like, "I love Van Gogh.
I've got the place mat. Let's do it."

258
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,859
I told you I was classy.

259
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,030
And so I'm learning all about Van Gogh,

260
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,449
I said, "Oh, my God,
Van Gogh was so interesting."

261
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,036
Here go the host of the tour:

262
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,372
"It's Van <i>Hhoghh."</i>

263
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,962
"What?" "It's Van <i>Hhoghh."</i>

264
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,881
I said, "No wonder this motherfucker
cut his ears off."

265
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,261
Who wanna hear that?

266
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,513
"Van <i>Hhoghh?"</i>

267
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,350
Thank you. I thought that was too soon.

268
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,103
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

269
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,526
The Dutch names are wild.
I mean, they're just crazy.

270
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,380
When you learn a Dutch name,
it's like you are actually speaking Dutch.

271
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,572
It's insane, like...

272
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,034
Gijs' best friend is named Thijs.
I'm like, "What?"

273
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,163
Gijs and Thijs, I'm like,
"Is this a ghetto morning show?

274
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,246
What is this?"

275
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,170
Gijs used to have a cat named Guus.
I was like, "You better not.

276
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,173
You better not."

277
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,929
One time, the cat got out.

278
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,265
Gijs called Thijs. He was like,
"Guus is on the loose!"

279
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,348
I'm like...

280
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,977
"Is this a Dutch Dr. Seuss?"

281
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,861
It's too much!

282
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,905
Too much!

283
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,574
I'm not making this up.

284
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,452
My mother-in-law, beautiful lady,

285
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,162
her name is Johanna,

286
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,749
she legally shortened it,
as you do in Holland,

287
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,583
to Hanneke.

288
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,048
What now?

289
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,636
I said, "Hanukkah, like the holidays?"

290
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,180
She's like, "It sound nothing
like the holidays."

291
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,391
I was like, "Happy Kwanzaa, bitch."
Like, I don't even know...

292
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,229
...what to say.
I feel like this is a joke on me.

293
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,732
But Dutch is wild, man.

294
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,569
There aren't a lot of verbs,
so you think it might be easy to speak.

295
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,530
But even the verbs are hard.

296
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,616
They're hard to say and pronounce,
they're hard to get through your mind.

297
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,742
Let me tell you something.

298
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,036
One of the first times I was in Amsterdam,

299
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,832
we were taking a group family picture

300
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:49,545
and I did not know the Dutch word
for "look"...

301
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,295
is "kijk."

302
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,885
Yes, bitch.

303
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,265
Spelled K-I-J-K, kijk.

304
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,035
So I'm just standing in public
with the family and they're just like,

305
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,019
<i>"Kijk </i>the camera,
<i>kijk, kijk, kijk </i>the camera.

306
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,148
<i>Kijk </i>the camera!"
I said, "Hanneke, do something!"

307
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,747
Oh, my God.

308
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,545
The verbs are crazy.

309
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,216
For instance,
there's this verb called "swaffling."

310
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,594
And that means...

311
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,929
to hit your dick on something.

312
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,735
That means, there were so many guys...

313
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,073
...in Holland
just hitting their dicks on shit,

314
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,411
they needed a verb for it.

315
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,165
I know y'all gonna have fun in Amsterdam.

316
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,463
Yes, sis. Yes, sis. Yes, sis.

317
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,632
Yes, sis, yes.

318
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,592
Be free, be you.

319
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,054
Like I said, my husband's very sweet.

320
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,513
He's very nice.

321
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,974
Sometimes I feel like he wants to kill me.

322
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,355
He always wants to take a long walk
at night. I'm just like, "Why?"

323
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,984
And then he's always like, "Let's go down
this alley to see if there's artwork."

324
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,069
I said...

325
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,450
...said, "No! Have you not seen <i>Ghost?</i>
That's how that shit happens."

326
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,579
Thank you. I thought that was too soon.

327
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,707
Thank you so much.

328
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,338
Every time my husband and I get an Airbnb,
he's always like,

329
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,632
"Babe, can you make sure
that they have a shed?"

330
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,715
I'm like...

331
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,595
"For what, Dexter?"

332
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,312
We were online one time, looking at stuff
we can't afford. It's our favorite thing,

333
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,399
and we were looking at vacation homes.

334
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,193
He's like, "Oh, you know,
if we get a vacation home,

335
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,570
I really want one that has
at least eight acres."

336
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,826
And I was joking, I was like,
"What, to hide my body?"

337
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,035
He's so sweet.

338
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,169
And then he comes back, "No, baby.

339
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,006
Everybody knows you need
at least 13 acres to hide a body."

340
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,049
I said...

341
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,468
"Who knows that?"

342
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,803
"Why do you know that?"

343
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,892
But sometimes I feel like
I just don't understand him, right?

344
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,895
Like, I'm his, like, sassy American wife

345
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,732
and he's this very polite,
white Dutch dude,

346
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,943
and I don't understand him sometimes.

347
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:05,490
And I feel like he doesn't understand
the nuance of an American husband.

348
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,619
You know, I'm from Jersey and he thinks
I sound aggressive all the time.

349
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,787
That's his thing.

350
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,831
Like, I'll be making breakfast
and I swear to God,

351
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,167
I feel like he just hears DMX, you know?

352
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,797
For real, I'm like,
"How do you want your eggs?

353
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,967
How you want your eggs?
This your wife!"

354
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,438
I mean, I feel sorry for him sometimes,

355
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,523
but I really don't understand him
sometimes either.

356
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,110
He doesn't pick up on my cues. Like,
one night, we were having a dinner party

357
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,279
and people were overstaying their welcome.

358
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,656
You know how motherfuckers
overstay their damn wel...

359
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,450
I'm like, "You gots to go now."

360
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,870
They start eating shit off the menu,
I'm like...

361
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,956
"These avocados were for the week."

362
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,461
"Why are you still here?"

363
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,050
"How am I gonna get my healthy fats?"

364
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,016
We actually had our first married fight
that night.

365
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,520
And if you ever have
your first married fight, you never forget

366
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,189
'cause we were in the bedroom
just going back and forth

367
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,441
and I was like, "You know what, Gijs?"

368
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,324
I said, "Go sleep on the couch.
I don't wanna do this no more."

369
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,283
He said, "No."

370
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,290
I said, "Go sleep on the couch now.
I don't wanna see you."

371
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,751
And he was like, "Why?"

372
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,463
I said, "'Cause we're having an argument

373
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,590
and everybody knows...

374
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,510
the men sleep on the couch."

375
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,680
"Everybody knows this."

376
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,974
He said, "Who told you that?"

377
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,355
I...

378
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,570
I said... I said, "Uh, all the movies,

379
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,698
all the TV shows:

380
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,200
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond,</i>

381
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,786
<i>Everybody Hates Chris.</i>

382
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,080
Nobody likes Gijs."

383
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,966
I do feel bad for him, though, sometimes,

384
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,595
because I don't like to do anything
he likes to do,

385
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,973
but he does all the stuff I like to do,

386
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,143
which is important.

387
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,854
Like, I like being bra-less on the couch

388
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,732
drinking some rosé,
watching <i>90 Day Fiancé.</i>

389
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,859
It's my jam.

390
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,445
Yes, I love that shit.

391
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,490
And everything he wants to do
requires health insurance.

392
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,201
I'm like, "I'm so tired."

393
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,914
Real talk, he wants to go camping so bad.

394
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,207
I was like, "No!

395
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,751
On purpose? No."

396
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,671
The closest I've ever been to camping
is eating sushi on the subway. I'm done.

397
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,008
Done. It's yuck.

398
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,511
- Out in the wild.
- Using my hands.

399
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,346
No <i>merci.</i>

400
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,101
Oh, my God, my man,
he wants me to go skiing with him.

401
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,187
I'm like, "With these titties,
all that gravity?"

402
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,814
I tried to go one time.

403
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,360
I spent $375 just on the outfit.

404
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,030
I couldn't afford to go up the mountain.

405
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,242
And this outfit was crazy.
I looked like a sassy Lego.

406
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,836
The other day my man hit me with,
he's just like, "Oh, babe,

407
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,838
do you want to climb a mountain?"

408
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,675
I said, "Emotionally?"

409
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,888
"'Cause, as a black woman,
I do that every day."

410
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,849
Yes. Yes, sis.

411
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,644
Yes, yes, white girl.

412
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,022
Tell your aunties how to vote.
Tell your aunties how to vote.

413
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,695
You know, you do have to do
what your partner likes to do.

414
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,531
And when you're, like,
different nationalities

415
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,614
and different countries,

416
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,033
it's just hard sometimes.

417
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,868
Like, I'm with a white boy, yes.

418
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,496
So I understand, I'm gonna
have to do some white boy shit.

419
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,583
But European white boy...

420
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,294
is next-level white boy shit.

421
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,965
Real talk. Like, the other day
we were home, I was working.

422
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,842
He's like, "Babe, come meet me outside."

423
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,760
I said, "Let me put my shoes on, hold up."

424
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,555
He's like, "You don't need your shoes."
I said, "Yes, I do.

425
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,892
And you do too."

426
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,857
I go meet him outside.

427
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,360
He's like, "Put your phone away."
I said, "Let me drop this pin first."

428
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,035
"I don't know what activity this is.
This is new."

429
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,164
He's like, "Give me your hands."

430
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,250
I was like,
"Ah! Is this a rose ceremony?"

431
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,047
"This is cute."

432
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,883
And he goes, "Let's look at the sun..."

433
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,855
"...and let's try to guess
what time it is."

434
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,369
I said, "Motherfucker, I got a job!

435
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,415
I'm trying to get that ass-wiping money!

436
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,961
Go fly your kite somewhere else!"

437
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,882
Uh! To be that bored <i>and </i>confident,
I don't get it.

438
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,885
I strive for it.

439
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,142
So silly.

440
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,436
Oh, my God.

441
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,065
What's really fun, too,
is when my single friends come over

442
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,235
and they're like, "I want what you have!
You like your partner."

443
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,528
I'm like, "You should."

444
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,198
You should like your partner,
and I love hooking people up,

445
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,493
but I feel like my single friends
never know what they want.

446
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,120
Who is single here? Who is single?

447
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:29,332
So many of y'all!

448
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,710
Okay, you boo-boo, what's your type?

449
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,506
I like somebody
that I can really converse with.

450
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,471
You like somebody
you can really converse with.

451
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,884
- Yeah.
- That's cute.

452
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,764
And he said "converse,"
so you know he reads a magazine.

453
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,227
That's cute. Like, "really converse."
Okay.

454
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,021
So you want someone
who's a little intellectual? Yes.

455
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,190
Okay, same page as you.

456
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,026
You know, I don't know if you ever dated
a smart person.

457
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,550
It's really hard to argue with them.

458
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,282
They always win,
so get someone not so smart.

459
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,576
But kind.

460
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,455
What's your type, boo-boo?

461
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,540
Smart, funny, tall.

462
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,125
Smart, funny and tall.

463
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,752
Okay.

464
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,090
No, you got a list. I like it.

465
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,135
I always feel bad when people say tall,
though,

466
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,845
'cause I'm like, short guys are great.

467
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,181
Yes.

468
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,099
See all them short men clapping?

469
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,520
They amazing. They can't reach everything,
but they don't have to.

470
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,647
They reach the things they supposed to.

471
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,692
Don't.

472
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,280
Don't sleep on that short, boo-boo.

473
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,075
Climb me like a ride at Busch Gardens now.

474
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,419
Oh, my God.

475
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,798
Skin... I was gonna say skinny people
over here. I'm so sorry.

476
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,219
All you bitches are skinny. Listen...

477
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,095
single people, single people.

478
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,039
It sounds like I'm calling you to, like,
board a Delta flight.

479
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,479
"Single people! Single people!"

480
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,983
"Go down the side aisle, now.
Single people."

481
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,786
No, that's great.
Who's single? Who's single?

482
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,364
Yes, oh, my God, so many bitches.
What's your type?

483
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,741
Thoughtful.

484
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,742
- What?
- Thoughtful.

485
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,826
Thoughtful?

486
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,915
Oh, my God.

487
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,501
You got to get more specific,

488
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,211
but I like that.

489
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,505
Someone that can read.

490
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,049
Yeah.

491
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,719
What's your type?

492
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,679
Family-oriented.

493
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,223
Now, family-oriented, like,
he already got kids?

494
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,976
'Cause I'll hook you up.

495
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,687
I will hook you up.

496
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,542
At this point you'll take it?
That's what I'm talking about.

497
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,006
Don't be picky, you'll fall in love.

498
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,821
Don't be picky, you will fall in love.
Real talk.

499
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,157
But I think, like, the more specific
you can get is amazing.

500
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,121
You know what I mean?
Specificity is everything,

501
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,039
whether it's someone casual or someone,
you know, for a very long time,

502
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,917
you know, people are just out here
like, "Tall, with h... ".

503
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,170
It's like you guys sound like
a character witness, like, I don't get it.

504
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,299
I'm just saying, think about who

505
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,051
you don't mind getting
in an argument with.

506
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,845
You're going to argue a lot.

507
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:33,933
You know, think about who you don't mind
being your last and/or first phone call.

508
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,583
They're going to be your everything.
Think about, you know...

509
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,565
who you want to put your face
in their crotch, like...

510
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,236
...you're going to do that a lot.

511
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,446
So much.

512
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,283
Even when you're arguing,
think about that, you know, like...

513
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,929
Who's gonna make you want to feel
like you're gonna be a better person?

514
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,330
That is your type, really.

515
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,998
And, I don't know, like,

516
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,001
you guys have a type, right?

517
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,754
But you don't even realize
that you are somebody else's type.

518
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,256
Hello.

519
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,218
Hello from the other side.

520
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,765
Whoever. Whoever.

521
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,935
Yes, honey, you are somebody else's type.

522
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,979
You don't even know that.
Like, I realized way too late in life

523
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,524
that I am an achievable Beyoncé
for government workers.

524
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,039
Oh, my God, are you serious?

525
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,542
And if they're like old,
black government workers named

526
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:46,422
Lawrence, Dennis, Curtis, Otis,
anything ending in "is," they love me!

527
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,591
Whoo!

528
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,470
I can't go to a Veterans Day parade.
My booty ain't safe!

529
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,056
She is not safe.

530
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,685
They looking at me like they want me
to motorboat the PTSD off their face

531
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,396
and I'll do it 'cause I'm a patriot.
Thank you so much.

532
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,941
Whoo! Thoughts and prayers.
Thank you for your service.

533
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,110
Thank you so much!

534
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,153
I mean, I don't know about you,

535
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,197
but I can make a government worker
work a holiday.

536
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,700
That's power, bitch.

537
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,826
What you do?

538
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,538
I'm just saying,

539
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,332
you want to go to the post office with me
in December, okay?

540
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,007
So silly.

541
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,092
Ah! Anyway...

542
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,303
Whatever you guys want,
I want that for you.

543
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,180
I wish for whatever you want.

544
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,641
Okay, I don't think we...
We don't do that enough.

545
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,560
And I really want whatever you want.

546
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,763
I don't really have any wishes
or wants anymore, like,

547
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,356
not with this current administration.
Let's be honest.

548
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,818
But I do have one teeny tiny wish
that I want to speak into fruition.

549
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,406
I really want Meghan Markle
to let herself go.

550
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,494
Do it, girl!

551
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,329
You did it!

552
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,832
You did the whole thing!

553
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,334
Like, wear your hair curly,

554
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:10,006
wear a blousy T-shirt,
wear a heeled sneaker. Get wild, Meghan.

555
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,135
Get wild and comfortable.

556
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,681
But I secretly and selfishly want
Meghan Markle to let herself go

557
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,100
so I can play her in <i>The Crown.</i>

558
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,489
Oh, my God, I'd be so good at it.
Are you serious?

559
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,867
I'd make <i>The Crown</i> so fucking edgy.

560
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,992
Oh, my God, I'd be in a corner
of Buckingham Palace

561
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,412
getting my hair braided...

562
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,666
...sucking on a chicken bone,

563
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,337
pouring frosé on someone's titties...

564
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,715
Being like,
"I'm a queen too, bitch, and what?"

565
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,551
Ooh, I'd make <i>The Crown</i> so edgy.

566
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,844
I want a sex scene with Harry.

567
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,222
I want a sex scene with Harry.

568
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,556
I would suck his ginger dick.

569
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,518
I would suck his ginger dick, now.

570
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,936
I would!

571
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,272
I would. You'd suck it too, bitch.
Don't act like you wouldn't!

572
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,691
I would suck that ginger dick.

573
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,653
The episode would be called
"Ginger Snaps." I thought about it.

574
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,655
She thought about it.

575
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,077
Come on, you know I'm already down
for the foreskin.

576
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,704
I am for the skin, man.
My husband...

577
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,581
is European. I love it, guys.

578
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,626
Don't cut your dick off.
You're Lady Gaga beautiful born that way.

579
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,504
She likes a salty protein snack.

580
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,922
Yes, she likes her...

581
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,365
presents under the Christmas tree.

582
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,943
Why are you giving me <i>Home Alone</i> face?

583
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,328
Okay, don't look at me like that.

584
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,945
That's why you single.
Everyone's like, "What do you do with it?"

585
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,557
It's a banana. You peel it back
and have breakfast, bitch.

586
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,644
Suck the dick and man the fuck up!

587
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,732
Are you serious?

588
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,527
These are our bodies!

589
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,112
Celebrate each other!

590
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,118
Let me tell you something. If you're
single and you can't afford to travel,

591
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,881
you need to suck a dick
with some foreskin,

592
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,706
it feels like you're in another country.

593
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,960
That dick is like a Moroccan stew,
you're like,

594
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,879
"Ooh, I got a flavor I can't quite place."

595
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,051
"Is that a za'atar? Is that a za'atar?"

596
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,724
"Ah! Is that preserved<i> limón?</i>

597
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,354
They ain't ready. They ain't ready.

598
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,653
Y'all ain't ready.

599
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,283
Not fucking ready.

600
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,286
Aww, are you wiping your face?

601
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,747
Are you crying?

602
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,957
Did you pee yourself a little bit?

603
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,212
Yeah, me too.

604
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,135
Oh, my God.
Oh, my face, I can't believe it's real.

605
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,099
It has been a good-ass year
for so many reasons.

606
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,726
For so many damn reasons.

607
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,688
A year ago, my husband and I welcomed
boy-girl twins in our life.

608
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,900
It was amazing.

609
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,027
Amazing!

610
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,696
Anybody here have kids,

611
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,157
pets, finicky plants, what y'all got?

612
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,409
Somebody taking care of something.
Who got kids?

613
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,495
Ooh!

614
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,288
Yes, honey, how many kids you got?

615
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,083
Just one, and you're pregnant now?

616
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,501
Bitch.

617
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,087
Congratulations.
You know who the father is?

618
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,298
Yes, she knows!

619
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,345
America's so beautiful.

620
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,188
It's hard, man.
I truly didn't realize how hard it'd be

621
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,357
to take care of little ones.

622
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,461
Really, 'cause, you know, when people
are like, "What's motherhood like?"

623
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:04,323
I'm just like,
"I feel like a shoe caught in a dryer."

624
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,205
You know, I'm just like...

625
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,877
I'm so tired.

626
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,548
And these little babies were born
in January, in the dead of winter,

627
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,758
and they were premature,
four and five pounds,

628
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,635
so we couldn't leave them for a while

629
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,759
and we would just like sit on the couch
and rock them and look at each other,

630
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,348
trying not to fall asleep.

631
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,725
And, like, after a while,

632
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,853
I feel like I just turned into a scene
from <i>The Hateful Eight.</i>

633
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,065
I was just looking at my husband,
rocking the baby.

634
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,111
And I was like...
"Who gonna go for provisions?"

635
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,164
It's so... You're so tired.

636
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,967
Like, I remember
in the middle of the night,

637
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,834
I was changing one of the babies

638
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,503
and I opened up the diaper
and just started to cry.

639
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,382
Cry! I was like,
"Baby girl, you have a penis."

640
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,470
I was crying and my husband's like,
"That's the boy."

641
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,138
"Oh."

642
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,061
I didn't know.

643
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,901
And husband, he's so sweet,

644
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,403
you know, I can see
this is his first time too.

645
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,905
It was very nice.

646
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,032
I remember the first time
I left for work,

647
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,826
he's like, "Okay, so I guess
I'm on daddy duty right now?"

648
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,745
I was like, "For all of time."

649
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,664
All of time.

650
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,376
All of time.

651
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,627
All.

652
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,004
Look at this time. Look at this time.
Look at all...

653
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,133
of... time! Motherfucker, daddy duty, all.

654
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,843
All of it. All.

655
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,762
All. All the time.

656
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,680
Daddy duty all the time.

657
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,516
It doesn't stop.

658
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,602
He's so well-meaning,

659
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,647
he's never taken care of a baby before.
Now we got twins, okay?

660
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,775
He's never even changed a diaper.
I said, "Ooh, you are not Caribbean."

661
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,487
That's some shit.

662
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,240
I was teaching him how to change a diaper,

663
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,826
I was like, "It's like an orthopedic shoe,
okay? You zip-zip."

664
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,663
But he didn't realize babies
have these things called "blowouts."

665
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,332
And it's not when
they straighten their hair.

666
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,964
It's when they shit up their back
to their necks.

667
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,051
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

668
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,472
And he was changing a baby
and it had a blowout and it kept shitting

669
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,643
and, oh, my God, my husband shut down
like a host in <i>Westworld.</i>

670
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,311
He's like, "But there's so much!"

671
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,620
I held that so long.

672
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,706
Yeah, it was so long,

673
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,001
I was thinking about
what I wanted to eat later.

674
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,513
You know what I mean,
we're out here doing it.

675
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,551
Twins is a lot of work.
You know, I realized I needed help.

676
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,137
I was really trying to be a shero.
I'm like, "No, I got this."

677
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,889
And I was like, "No, bitch, you don't.

678
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,225
You really need help,
you have to call on your village."

679
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,854
And I'm better about it now, you know.
We gotta ask for fucking help.

680
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,941
Now I'm out and I just hand the baby
to someone so I can tie my shoe.

681
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,215
My husband's like, "Do you know her?"

682
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,489
I'm like, "No, but that's a black woman,
we family."

683
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,618
I love you.

684
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,293
Real talk, man, I mean,

685
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:48,005
I remember the first time the babies
were old enough where we can leave them

686
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,131
and go to a party.

687
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,051
Ooh, I had a statement lip on,
I was like, "You know I'm ready."

688
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,639
But it was like we'd never been in public
before. Oh my God, we were a mess.

689
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,725
It was like we were in our 20s
doing coke for the first time.

690
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,561
We were like, "We got a story,
you want to hear it?"

691
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,480
"Tell me your story, I got a story too!"

692
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,190
And then I fell asleep on a toilet.

693
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,488
Oh, my God, you need the help.
You need the help. Like,

694
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,658
I used to judge Mormons all the time.

695
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,910
I'm like,
"Ooh, why they got all them women

696
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,121
with the braids and that one dude
with the man bun? That's too much.

697
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,499
They doing too much."

698
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,582
I get it.

699
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,671
Ooh, I get it now.
I want a sister wife so bad.

700
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,090
I really do. People are like,

701
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,509
"What you want for your birthday?"
"A sister wife. Just...

702
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,304
please come over, fold laundry,
hold the baby, touch his dick,

703
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,515
I'm not jealous."

704
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,641
"I gotta touch my toes.

705
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,602
I gotta cat-cow my way
back into existence right now."

706
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,066
Cat-cow.

707
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,150
Cat-cow.

708
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,364
You ever get stuck in front of...
In back of somebody in yoga class

709
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,033
who's just, like, cat-cowing too hard,
you're, like, "All right."

710
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,495
"I get it, you're flexible."

711
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,136
Oh, my God, and when people act like
it's an <i>American Idol</i> audition

712
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,876
in yoga when you're supposed
to be chanting, like...

713
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,461
And this bitch out here...

714
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,761
You're doing too much!

715
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,142
So silly.

716
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,939
Oh, man, I didn't realize as a parent,
especially of babies,

717
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,733
you need so much equipment.

718
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,278
It's like a walking <i>Shark Tank</i> episode,
I'm like, "What is this?"

719
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,323
I can't remember the names of everything,
I'm tired,

720
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,575
and one day I was taking baby girl
out for a walk

721
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,702
and I forgot the name of the Bjorn.

722
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,663
So I just yelled in the house,
I said, "Baby!

723
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,082
Get me the strap-on for our daughter!"

724
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,550
"No, not the black one. The purple one!"

725
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,597
I'm a good person.

726
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,729
I'm a good mom!

727
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,566
Oh, my God, and also...

728
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,195
I didn't realize you have to become, like,
a low-budget Dr. Oz right away, like,

729
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,358
these little bodies, something goes wrong,
it's just, like, how do I fix this?

730
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,743
You know, like,
I've never even bathed a baby before.

731
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,913
And, oh, my God,
I'll just tell you this right now,

732
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,206
they slippery as fuck.

733
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,967
But they're resilient.

734
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,305
Yeah!

735
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,231
Yeah, it's all cartilage, so...

736
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,698
I'll never forget the first time
we gave the babies a bath.

737
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,658
It was warm water,

738
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,786
really cute organic soap.
I said, "It's gonna be great."

739
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,080
We put them in the water.

740
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,666
They were crying
like it was battery acid.

741
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,795
I said, "Get them out the water.
We're never going to bathe them."

742
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,383
My husband's like, "We gotta bathe them."
I said, "No, we don't.

743
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,803
We just gonna get the hot spots
like a walk of shame."

744
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,848
Keep 'em moving.

745
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,269
And really, man,

746
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,814
you find out who your friends are
when something good happens in your life.

747
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,235
Like, I didn't realize so many people
were going to have my back.

748
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,696
You know what I mean?
I didn't want to be that person, like,

749
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,698
"I've got a baby shower,
give me this stuff..."

750
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,074
I didn't want to do that at all.

751
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,918
And I had friends just come out
the woodwork,

752
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,912
they're like, "We want to set up
a registry for you. What do you want?"

753
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,832
And I'm like, "I don't need anything.
That's so sweet.

754
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,917
I just need CBD oil and cash."

755
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,338
That's the new parent registry
right there.

756
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,009
And then other friends, like,
don't even know how to act.

757
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,446
I had a friend say, "I want to
come over and hold the baby."

758
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,056
I said, "Oh, yes, Jesus, come over
and hold the baby. Thank you so much."

759
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,144
She came over, they were weeks old,
I said, "Can you wash your hands?

760
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,438
They don't have their shots yet."
And she goes, "Oh...

761
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,523
I'm spiritually clean."

762
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,823
I said, "You sound dirty as fuck."

763
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,720
Didn't want to wash her hands. I was
like, "I guess you won't hold the baby."

764
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,246
So I'm talking to her,
wishing she'd leave...

765
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,084
She just eating up all my good fruit
and crackers and stuff...

766
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,005
Baby boy started fussing,
so I picked him up,

767
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,849
I started, you know, cuddling him
and stuff like that, comforting him.

768
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:43,759
Here she go...

769
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,178
"Hmm, he gonna manipulate you."

770
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,390
What? I said, "He's six weeks old!"

771
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,519
She's like, "He's manipulating you

772
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,480
and he's gonna manipulate you
even more."

773
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,818
I said, "Bitch, did you get catfished
by a toll booth worker?"

774
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,456
Don't come for a bitch.

775
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,419
Husband and I were really lucky

776
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,172
because we welcomed these babies
via surrogacy.

777
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,632
And...

778
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,634
Thank you.

779
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,135
And that was really special.

780
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,222
It was really, really special.

781
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,016
And, you know, it's always an awkward,
like, conversation to have

782
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,980
when you run into somebody,
'cause they're like,

783
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,062
"What's your birth story?"
I'm like, "Expensive."

784
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,073
But I ran into one of my neighbors
in New York

785
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,403
and he's like, "Ah, how y'all been?"
I'm like, "Good, man, we just welcomed

786
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,779
these boy-girl twins..."

787
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,574
And he's like, "Oh, you know what?
I don't mean to offend..."

788
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,827
I said, "But, you're gonna."

789
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,453
"Give it to me."

790
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,641
He's like, "I know a really good diet
if you want to take the baby weight off."

791
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,083
I said...

792
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:02,087
"That is so funny you say that..."

793
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,047
"...'cause we actually had a surrogate."

794
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,924
And then he goes, "What's a surrogate?"

795
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,761
I said, "Oh, my God." This is why we need
more federal funding for education,

796
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:14,099
so people know what the fuck is going on
outside of their two-mile radius,

797
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:18,186
I'm fucking done.
Let's get educated, okay? It matters.

798
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,860
So... I'm explaining it to him,
I was like,

799
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,530
"Our DNA, she's the carrier,
a miracle happened, we have a family,

800
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,324
she's an angel walking on Earth..."

801
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,700
I see his eyes going...

802
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,203
And he goes,
"Oh, is it like <i>Handmaid's Tale?"</i>

803
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,545
And I knew I had a choice.

804
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,175
So I said,
"Yes, exactly like <i>Handmaid's Tale."</i>

805
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,472
It's exactly like it.

806
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,142
That's how you start a rumor.

807
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,728
It was really a wild ride, though,
for a good while

808
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,356
because surrogacy
is not legal in New York.

809
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:03,941
Which is crazy.

810
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,069
Like, I am so tired
of old white men making laws for my body,

811
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,821
and every other woman's bodies.
It's too much.

812
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,783
For us, by us.

813
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,826
Oh, man.

814
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,996
You know, it was really crazy, like,

815
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,415
I didn't think that's, like,
how my journey would go.

816
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,002
And I always tell my friends, like,
it doesn't even matter at this point.

817
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,672
Right? Like, it doesn't even matter
how the journey goes,

818
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,548
as long as you get to the other side.

819
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,199
That's the only thing that matters,

820
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,803
so don't give up anything
you want in life.

821
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,471
Really.

822
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,765
And I wish somebody
would have told me that.

823
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,767
You know, I was sad.

824
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,145
I was sad that I couldn't carry
but so happy somebody else could,

825
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,604
you know?

826
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,316
I decided to make the best out of it

827
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,777
because you have to,
'cause life is still happening.

828
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,364
So when my surrogate was waiting
to go into labor,

829
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,659
my husband and I were at the bar next door
having a glass of wine.

830
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,708
And Oprah says you can have it all
but not at the same time,

831
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,377
but I think you can, honey,
'cause I did that shit.

832
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,841
Oh!

833
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,802
The need to take care of something

834
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,138
besides your dusty friends
is fucking insane.

835
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,140
At one point I was like,

836
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,392
"We gotta adopt a dog.
I gotta take care of something."

837
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,235
My husband said,
"What kind of dog you want?"

838
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,269
I said, "A big one."

839
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,397
So he came home with a lab mastiff.

840
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,358
Do you know what a mastiff was?

841
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,777
I didn't know.
I should have Google Imaged.

842
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,905
We have a pony. I have a pony.

843
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,869
I said, "She's 140 pounds,
she's my goal weight." Listen...

844
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,707
I have a shovel for her shit.

845
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,666
I wear overalls.

846
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,877
I look like a Puerto Rican Kathy Bates.
Listen...

847
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,258
I see so much shit before 11:00 a.m.
that's not mine. I'm a good person.

848
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,720
She is big and black and beautiful,
she won't stop growing,

849
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,848
I call her Precious. Um...

850
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,558
Too soon? Too soon.

851
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,184
Spoiler?

852
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,983
And I don't mean to be a big titty PSA,
but I just want to say,

853
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,503
if you're going to adopt a dog,
look into a black or brown one

854
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,780
because white and beige ones
get adopted first

855
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,615
and the black ones go down first.

856
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,076
#blackdogsmatter, thank you so much.

857
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,952
Are you writing it down?
You'll remember.

858
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,802
But what I love about my kids, I mean,
obviously because they're mine.

859
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,130
I love that they have such crazy
personalities, do you know what I mean?

860
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,715
Because I'm the only child,

861
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,802
my parents like to say
they got it right the first time.

862
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,304
But really, they weren't fucking,
you know?

863
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,309
Come on, separate bedrooms
and all those puzzles?

864
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,856
They ain't fucking.

865
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,858
But I'm fascinated, like,

866
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,985
they're the same ingredients
but so different.

867
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,072
Like, every morning
baby boy wakes up smiling

868
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,615
and baby girl wakes up crying

869
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,701
and I'm like, "Damn, it's like they
already know about the patriarchy."

870
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:04,996
How?

871
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,585
Like, real talk, baby boy just has
so much pure joy in his heart.

872
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,296
Every time we go out in New York,
in our neighborhood,

873
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,383
he wants to make eye contact,
he wants people to smile at him...

874
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,094
I'm like, "Motherfucker, stop it.
You going to get robbed."

875
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,180
Stop it!

876
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,766
And baby girl, she's so sassy.

877
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,685
I don't know where the fuck
she get it from.

878
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,563
I do not know.

879
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,484
Like, even the pediatrician was just like,
"Wow, her peripheral vision is so good."

880
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,703
I said, "That's side-eye, motherfucker."

881
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:54,045
She know you got the needle.

882
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,340
Oh, man.

883
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,136
Anyway, I used to, um...

884
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,680
I used to judge parents so much.

885
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,434
Like, you can't judge people until you,
like, are really in them shoes.

886
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,117
You know what I mean? I'm like,
"I'm not going to do it like that.

887
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,105
I'm gonna be cool and do it like this."

888
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,066
And then you're a parent and you're like,
"Oh, fuck."

889
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,610
"Help me."

890
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,363
Like, I used to judge parents

891
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,365
when you would ask how old their kid is

892
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,367
and they'd be like,
"19 and a half months."

893
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,832
"Please don't make me do math.
Like, is that two? Is that two?

894
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,793
I'm not your accountant, I can't...

895
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,630
read these receipts right now."

896
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,760
But I realize parents do that shit

897
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:45,138
because it's truly the last night
they had a good night's rest.

898
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,848
Real talk!

899
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,103
If you out, you see a cute baby, you ask
the parent, "How old's your baby?"

900
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,898
And they be like,
"Eight months and four days."

901
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,787
So happy.

902
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,250
You give that new parent a hug,
you give him a joint,

903
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,836
buy him a pickleback, I don't give a shit.
Be nice to them.

904
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,841
I used to judge parents too,
actually, um...

905
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:27,138
that do that third-person singsongy shit
in front of you.

906
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,307
Oh, my God, you ever been out...

907
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:33,228
and see a dad just do, like,
a one-person show

908
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,814
in front of you with their kid?

909
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,901
"Daddy wants to put your jacket on.
Could Daddy put your jacket on?

910
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,945
Daddy wants to put the jacket..."

911
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,657
"Put the jacket on, Daddy."

912
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,411
"It's March, we need a jacket.
Put the jacket on."

913
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,374
Oh, my God.

914
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,045
These moms out here
doing the singsongy shit

915
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,590
like they're your waitress,
"What do you wanna eat?"

916
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,682
"Mommy wanna get you something to eat.
What do you want?

917
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:11,933
Mommy want to get you..."

918
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,810
"Get the kid something to eat.

919
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,688
The kid want food."

920
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,317
Oh, my God.
"Mommy wanna get you a cookie.

921
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,776
What kind of cookie do you want?"

922
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,611
"It ain't <i>British Bake Off, </i>bitch."

923
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,407
Get the kid a cookie.

924
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,580
But I'm realizing now,
you do that singsongy shit

925
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,958
because you can't rush your kids,
you know?

926
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,169
They don't understand
what it's like being late.

927
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,381
They don't. We can't rush our kids.

928
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,425
If we rush them,
they're gonna be all anxious

929
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,789
and we're just going to have
a world full of Larry Davids.

930
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,263
Who wants that?

931
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,390
Not me, sis!

932
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,191
Nobody wants that, and I just fell
into that singy-songy shit.

933
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,759
I didn't even know I was doing it.

934
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,403
I came home one night and I was like,

935
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,489
"Oh, baby girl,

936
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,492
Daddy didn't change your diaper.

937
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,120
So mommy gonna change your diaper.

938
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,937
'Cause who rules the world?

939
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,399
Girls!"

940
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,862
I just wanna say,

941
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,367
oh, my God, you guys,
I truly feel like a size 13.

942
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,661
Um...

943
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,914
I just want to say, I've been doing
stand-up for 18 years,

944
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,648
and it is...

945
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,668
It's been a journey.

946
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,128
It's been a journey.

947
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,148
And that's why I tell you, just keep doing
whatever the fuck you want to do

948
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,259
because you never know what is
going to happen, but it'll be great.

949
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,344
Anything you want.

950
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,428
And...

951
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,765
Oh, my God.

952
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,308
And I just want to say...

953
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,396
And I just want to say, there's a lot
of shit going on in the world right now.

954
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,982
There's always going to be a lot of shit
going on in the world

955
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,609
and it doesn't matter
what your title is at work,

956
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,278
or what your degree says,

957
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,071
or whatever fucking car you drive.

958
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,199
The only thing that matters
is your character.

959
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,702
We have to be kind to each other

960
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,747
and I cannot appreciate you enough
for being kind to me.

961
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,710
That's been my motherfucking show!

962
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:52,403
<i>Oy vey!</i> And up.
Use your knees, Page. Come on, push it!
