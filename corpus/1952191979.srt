lost everything to a powerful evil

That is why I must find a way back.

in mind, Kiina?

00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,428
Ever fix an
injured Glatorian?

351
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,867
No way! He's not
touching Gresh.

352
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,564
The boy needs help, Kiina.

353
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:23,129
Well, I've had to patch
myself up a few times.

354
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,369
Touchy.

355
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:28,844
Yeah, like every time you've
been pounded on for stealing!

356
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:34,345
"Collecting"! Maybe you should let
me work on your ears next, Kiina.

(HUMMING)

358
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:43,023
He better pull through.

359
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,186
You got that?

360
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:45,786
Great. No pressure.

361
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:50,867
What if he's the traitor?

362
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:52,425
Then he'll pay.

363
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:57,131
Something wrong?

364

There's a familiarity
about this place.

366
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:04,940
It must have been created by
the old rulers of Bara Magna.

367
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:06,711
Great Beings.

368
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:08,514
The Great Beings
were here?

369
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,713
"Great Destroyers"
is more like it.

370
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:13,189
Why do you speak
against the Great Beings?

371
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:16,056
Because they wrecked
our world, that's why.

372
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:21,195
This was Bara Magna before the
Great Beings left us here to rot.

373
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:28,696
You have no proof
of this, Kiina.

374
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:31,605
They could've just as easily
ended up buried in the ruins.

375
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:36,477
No. The Great Beings did not fall here.
That much I am sure of.

376
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,350
What is beyond this?
KIINA: No idea.

377
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:45,889
Never been able
to get it open.

378
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:47,083
Yeah, me neither.

379
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,490
But I bet there's something
good through there, huh?

380
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:53,554
Keep dreaming! And pay attention
to what you're doing, thief.

383
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,193
It looks like this could have
been some sort of laboratory.

What's wrong?
You look like you've just seen a ghost.

You know that thing?

00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:27,322
Yes. A gigantic
mechanical being.

390
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,826
Just like the one
now enslaving my people.

391
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:33,625
Wait! You think the Great Beings
had something to do with it!

392
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:37,132
No. The responsibility lies
on my shoulders alone.

393
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,067
This place, these symbols.

394
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,937
We are on the right track.

You have all the fun.
l get the next two.

396
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:05,624
You can have them.

397
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,098
Let's move.
We need to warn the villages

398
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,396
about the Skrall
and bone hunters uniting.

399
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:13,369
And that we've got
a traitor on the inside.

00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,905
How are you holding up?

401
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,838
I'm fine, thanks to Berix.

402
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,874
No problem.

403
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:23,277
But I could use a new weapon.
Skrall shredded my blade.

404
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:25,641
Get in line.

405

00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,380
Don't even think
about it.

407
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:34,016
l am sorry about your weapons,
but I must continue my journey.

408
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:36,151
What? You're not
going to help us?

409
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:38,092

battles to fight.

410
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:44,464
Trust me, Mata Nui,
I've seen you fight. You're not ready.

411
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:47,869

This mask gave me new life,

416

understand its power.

417
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:12,422
l think it only works on things
that are, or were, alive.

418
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:15,830
No problem. Most Glatorian
weapons are made of bone or claw.

419
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,697
Collected a few,
have you?

I've got awesome Toa powers,

435

let me test them out.

winning than fancy weapons.
