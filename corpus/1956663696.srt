I need to use a phone.

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,697
Hello?

29
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,702
Hello?

30
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,823
Goddammit.

31
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,392
Where the fuck is everybody?

32
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,162
What the fuck.

33
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,566
Where the fuck is everybody?

34
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,403
Where the fuck am I,

00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,640
Where the fuck is everybody?

36
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,541
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

37
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:17,844
Fuck.

38
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,184
God fucking damn it.

39
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,180
(wheezing)

40
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,958
I need your help, man.

41
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,965
Hey.

42
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,467
I really need to find a phone.

43
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,120
Hey man, I've been
 in an accident.

44
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,125
There's some people that
 were hurt really, really bad.

45
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,960
I gotta get some help.

46
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,965
I need to find a phone.

47
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,709
Fuck.

48
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:56,548
- I'm okay, too much
 breakfast maybe.

49
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,760
- Hey, listen man,

50
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,532
I appreciate the ride
 but I really need

51
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,534
to find a fucking phone.

52
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,676
Look, I'm really lost,

53
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,814
I can't even remember
 fucking nothing.

54
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,023
And I don't even know
where you're taking me,

55
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:14,326
but I trust you realize
 this gun is fucking loaded,

56
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,563
so don't even think
 of trying anything.

57
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,568
I need a phone, man,

58
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,571
why are there no
 people around here?

59
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,417
- Making omelets tonight.

60
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,621
(wheezing)

61
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,332
Secret recipe, lots of cheese.

62
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,737
On some garlic, I
 use lots of garlic.

63
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,919
Salty, I like that.

64
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:22,194
Take two or three eggs, no
 less, a little bit of milk,

65
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:28,033
little bowl, let them cook.

66
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,570
Let them cook for a while.

67
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,739
Let them cook for a while.

68
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,146
They flush easy,

69
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:44,316
let them cook for a while.

70
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,295
- Hello?

71
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,197
Hello?

72
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:08,800
- [Voiceover] Dial again.

73
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,870

74
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,043
- Happy birthday.

75
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,153
(dial tone)

76
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,933
(laughter)

77
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,007
(banging)

78
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,570
(laughter)

79
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:06,177
(shouting)

80
00:40:56,822 --> 00:41:00,458
- You fucking bitch,

81
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,729
you fucking skanky
 fucking bitch.

82
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:06,097
- Baby just calm

83
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:10,001
- Shut up, cunt,

84
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,537
- Baby, I don't know what I did.

85
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:15,006
- You are such a fucking
 cunt, I fucking loved you

86
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,376
and know this pussy is
like a fucking outhouse.

87
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:21,179
You'll let anybody
 shit in it, won't you?

88
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,182
You just anybody

89
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,851
Where is he, where is he?

90
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,586
- Who? I don't know-

91
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:31,857
- Shut the fuck up, where is he?

92
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,292
Where the fuck is he,
 you fucking bitch?

93
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,394
- Baby, you're scaring me.

94
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,130
- Oh really, want
 to talk about it?

95
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,500
Want to get some therapy,
 you fucking cunt?

96
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,302
Do you want to do that?

97
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:48,640
I have fucking seen him
in those trees, okay,

98
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,042
watching, waiting, looking
 at me like I'm like

99
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,311
some fucking cuckold, right?

100
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,213
- Herm?

101
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:58,216
- Herm, herm.

102
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,818
You thought you had a
 nice little fucking hiding

103
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,152
place here, didn't you?

104
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,255
But y'all fucked up,
 because I saw him.

105
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,957
- You know, fuck you, Herm.

106
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,492
- Fuck you, bitch.

107
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,528
- You kept me in this prison
 for I don't know how long.

108
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,998
Trapped.

109
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,567
- I seen him out in that tree.

110
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:18,637
- You're out of
 your fucking mind.

111
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:21,673
- You don't love me
 anymore, is that it?

112
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:25,777
Look at you, you fucking,
 look at you, fucking

113
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,846
I loved, I...

114
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,253
I loved you, pure
 and simple, I did.

115
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,821
- What's your name, sweetheart?

116
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,424
- I don't know.

117
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,661
- New beginning. Here's to it.

118
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,747
(growling)

119
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,700
(gasping)

120
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:22,360
(screaming)

121
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:53,110
(gentle music)

122
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,235
- These trees, they have a code.

123
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,005
That's not for
 our understanding.

124
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,776
They'll make room for us,

125
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,346
if only for a little while.

126
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,461
Did you ever remember your name?

127
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,865
- No.

128
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:39,970
- You changed here
 between the trees.

129
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,609
You'll change some more.

130
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,851
- I only see you in
 these dark places.

131
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:00,825
- Darkness shines bright here,
 drear's not its complement.

132
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,463
|I hope you find what's next,

133
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:09,700
then you'll see me
 in the daylight.

134
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,508
Follow my friend.

135
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,248
He's not always around.

136
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,319
- Come on in, sweetheart.

137
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:02,940
* Once we were contenders,

138
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,310
* Nothing but the
 stars in our eyes

139
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,747
* Free as a wind
 blowing out on the sea

140
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:12,817
* Happy, loving life

141
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,787
* Yes we were

142
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:24,762
* Once we were contenders

143
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:28,132
* Trying to get a leg in

144
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:31,201
* Wearing them hose in
 them tight-fitting clothes

145
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:34,438
* And sexy girlfriends and man

146
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:37,908
* That old house
that we lived in

147
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:41,178
* Strangers sleeping in our beds

148
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:44,481
* The only thing cool
 about supper time

149
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,417
* Would be beers who
 got a drinking stick

150
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,987
* Any day now,

151
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:54,792
* As I tossed in here from show

152
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,895
* I'll take a look
 in the old crack mill

153
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:02,066
* And I'm feeling
feeling a whole lot old

154
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:09,206
* We're still contenders

155
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:12,743
* Being blessed in
 spite of the change

156
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:16,246
* We got luxury cars
 and a country club bar

157
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:19,083
* Our agents in the hour erased

158
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,785
* They got fancy

159
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:21,719
- Hey lady.

160
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,122
* Surround the places we live

161
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,523
- You got any water?

162
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:29,393
* But I'm telling you
son it's a lot more fun

163
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,761
* When you're dreaming
 how to make it big *

164
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:31,595
- Huh?

165
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,099
- You got any water?

166
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,028
(screaming)

167
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:18,228
- Morning.

168
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:22,652
(screaming)

169
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,498
- You should have
 never come here.

170
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:33,857
(grunting)

171
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:05,081
(laughter)

172
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:36,880
- Hi, hi daddy, hi.

173
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,683
Hi daddy.

174
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,918
(laughter)

175
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,762
Hi daddy.

176
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:05,875
(shouting)

177
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,183

178
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:04,934
(laughter)
