2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,078
- Flying saucers.
- My father and I have both seen them.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,755
- We've both inside them.
- Aah.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,518
Not again, you bastards!

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,071
Your daddy's big, important secret job
is to figure out if--

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,235
You're drunk, Anne.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,431
You shouldn't take the car out
when you're drunk.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,029
Owen Crawford.
This guy broke her heart.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,310
My life is not gonna be complete
until I ruin his.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,431
I need proof there's
a clear and present danger.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,073
I need a smoking gun, gentlemen.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,029
My father's in your hospital.
A tumour they can't operate on.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,199
Exactly the same size
in exactly the same place.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,709
I have an identical tumour
in my own head.

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,512
DOCTOR: What are the odds?

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,229
It could be something as simple
as a tracking device

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,076
that allows them to know where
the important test subjects are.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,071
You can have mine.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,074
We would never do anything
to harm a private citizen.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,948
- (gunshots)
- (screams)

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,311
We would never do anything
to a citizen against his will.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,952
Aah!

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,628
I personally would never
do anything to harm a child.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,071
Where's my father?
I want to see my father!

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,352
Thank you for volunteering
to help your country again.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,390
(laughter)

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,674
ALLIE: What makes us human?

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,995
That we can think?

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,236
That we can feel sorrow and pain?

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,111
Maybe.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,748
That we can laugh?

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,995
I hope so.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,751
We can hurt and we can laugh
and we know a past and a present.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,076
And. in some ways. a future.

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,874
Maybe what makes us human
is that we know just enough

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,672
to think we know
where we're going.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,950
# Turn around, go back down,
back the way you came #

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,078
# Can't you see that flash of fire,
brighter than the day? #

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,594
(horn honks)

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,916
Come on, Manny, let's go.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,389
Wow.

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,875
This could be big.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,071
We get these reports
two, three times a week.

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,998
Mutilated cattle, dancing lights,

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,713
the sort of thing
we're about to look at.

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,036
For you to come personally,
you must have some reason.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,070
The reports look good.

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,436
First one came in
from a local pilot out of Gary,

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,153
then a commercial airline
en route to Chicago.

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,039
This could finally be your proof, Dad.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,072
I mean, this could
finally show the threat is real.

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,032
We already know that, don't we?

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,118
Don't try so hard, kid.

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,715
Just do a good job.
Your old man'll come around.

55
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,072
Keep these people back!

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,756
Keep them back.

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,076
Stay back, folks.

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,073
Out of the way, please.
Stay back, folks.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,069
MAN: We may need that.
You never know what's out there.

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,236
SECOND MAN: Looks like a reporter.

61
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,189
MAN: Notify dispatch...

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,072
Reports are all good, Bob.
This is real.

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,837
It's a landing strip.
I'd stake my career on it.

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,589
Yes, tell the President,
and tell him I believe it signals

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,956
that our friends
will soon be here in force.

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,750
I really think you
should look at this personally.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,392
Thank you, Bob. Thank you.

68
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,835
- The President's on his way.
- That's great news.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,834
Why don't you...

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,712
go help out
with crowd control or something.

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,558
(chattering)

72
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,032
(soldier shouts out orders to crowd)

73
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,159
Colonel Crawford.
Toby Woodruff.

74
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,595
This is Ted Olson.

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,239
Where's the President?

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,076
Mr Olson is with the NSA.
I'm with Defence.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,994
The President felt you'd
be better off dealing with the...

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,111
the "hands-on" guys.

79
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,038
The "hands-on" guys?

80
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,435
You been briefed?

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,074
Let's go for a little ride,
and we'll see how you feel.

82
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,955
Look at that.

83
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,670
This has happened before, here
and France, England, and Germany.

84
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,074
The scale of this, the intent.

85
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,835
Look at the formation.
It's like a runway.

86
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,078
Like a landing strip?

87
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,637
If it's a landing strip,
that means they could be--

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,511
Landing?

89
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,919
Think Nixon stands
a chance at a second term?

90
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,588
My opinion, he'd have
to fix the next election.

91
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,915
No one likes the creep.

92
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,350
Truman was President
when I started this project.

93
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,835
I've survived four of them.
Nixon will make five.

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,711
I've lasted this long

95
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,271
because I know how to ruin
the people who get in my way.

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,948
What I want you puppies
to do is get on the phone

97
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,350
and make the President know
he has to be here immediately.

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,028
This is a threat to our country
of unparalleled proportions.

99
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,668
You do that for me, because
long after Richard Nixon

100
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,875
is just a faded memory,

101
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,072
I'll be around
to make your lives a living hell.

102
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,913
Looks like there's another one here.

103
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,951
(creaking)

104
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,469
(raven caws)

105
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,478
(caw caw)

106
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,233
Dr Powell, we've got something.

107
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,029
Very nice, Buzz.

108
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,470
It's in remarkable condition.

109
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,079
Where'd you find it?

110
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,673
North six, west twelve.

111
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,075
- Where we found the drums?
- And there's more.

112
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,759
Let's go check it out.

113
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,269
(raven caws)

114
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,791
Do you think we could be
onto a smoke hut?

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,070
Something the shaman used
to drive out evil spirits?

116
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,350
Yeah, possibly.

117
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,755
Sarah's back on the demons again.

118
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,632
That's why we came here
in the first place, isn't it?

119
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,473
Rumours of demons
in the woods.

120
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,916
The places that
the Russian settlers wouldn't go.

121
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,350
Places that people still won't go?

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,916
That and 80 years of research
into the Tsimshian people.

123
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,673
Dr Powell.

124
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,269
Yeah. What's up, Daryl?

125
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,954
I found something.

126
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,195
Oh, yeah.

127
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,599
I don't think it's a smokehut.

128
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,472
Looks to me more like
a funeral potlatch.

129
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,199
The drums, the bowls,

130
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,238
the raven to take the spirit
into the next world.

131
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,153
We're all dead.

132
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,075
First, there's the demons,
then we open up a tomb. We're toast.

133
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,955
Remind me, what are these demons
supposed to be doing?

134
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,469
They're a native version
of the legend

135
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,954
of the Incubus and Succubus.

136
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,628
They would take people
from their homes to the woods,

137
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,950
and sometimes, the women
would come back pregnant.

138
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,516
Sometimes, they don't come back at all.

139
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,916
Daryl, you okay?

140
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,069
I'm hurt, man.

141
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,476
Here. Buzz, grab a ladder.

142
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,032
How you doing, buddy?

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,755
I landed bad. I twisted my ankle.

144
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,599
We'll get you out. Don't worry.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,069
What the...

146
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,114
Oh, my God.

147
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,835
Sir.

148
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,913
Yes?

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,838
23 years.

150
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,358
What are you going to do?

151
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,079
Learn to fly-fish.

152
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,516
For what it's worth...

153
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,075
I think you got a raw deal.

154
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,909
I tell my doctor I'm worried about
my heart, my blood pressure.

155
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,509
He tells me to take these pills
and to go fly-fishing.

156
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,109
Apparently there's something
soothing about hooking a fish,

157
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,511
looking at them, then letting them go.

158
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,232
What about Jesse Keys?

159
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,873
My smoking gun.

160
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,229
16-year-old boy

161
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,995
with something put in his head
by our friends.

162
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,989
You and I both know
we're never gonna find him.

163
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,074
He disappeared from that
bomb shelter and fell off the planet.

164
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,674
I'll tell you something.

165
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,156
I've never known what our friends
were up to, not a clue.

166
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,835
Roswell, taking all these people.

167
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,110
But the way they took Jesse Keys...

168
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,953
whatever they're doing,

169
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,549
we don't stand a damn chance
against them.

170
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,075
Is there something else?

171
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,070
I was just wondering
where to put the desk.

172
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,517
I guess they didn't want
to go outside the project.

173
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,079
They put me in charge.

174
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,675
Great.

175
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,077
Then you can look for Jesse Keys.

176
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,672
ALLIE: I asked my dad once
about his dad. my grandfather.

177
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,552
I knew he'd had
some hard times.

178
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,235
But I didn't know
a lot more than that.

179
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,993
I said to my dad.

180
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,589
"I guess maybe
he was kind of lost. "

181
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,836
"Not lost. really. "
my dad said.

182
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,476
but for a while.
he was definitely bewildered. "

183
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,078
# I hope to get home all right #

184
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,399
# Hey, Mr Spaceman #

185
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,068
# Won't you please
take me along? #

186
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,072
# I won't do anything wrong #

187
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,075
# Hey, Mr Spaceman... #

188
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,834
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw?

189
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,076
And acid trips don't count.

190
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,476
I saw this two-headed snake
once at the zoo in San Diego.

191
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,074
And one time, man...

192
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,471
I think I saw a flying saucer.

193
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,079
I've been on a flying saucer,
more than once.

194
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,953
One time, I saw my father.

195
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,076
He'd been dead...

196
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,078
for four days.

197
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,871
Okay, my man.

198
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,469
Now, that is really and truly weird.

199
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,076
A waste of friggin' time
and money, going to the moon.

200
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,392
You know what I admired about you
back when we were over there?

201
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,997
I was in four different units
while I was in 'Nam,

202
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,236
and you were the only one.

203
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,392
What do you mean, "only one"?

204
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,074
Officer who walked point.

205
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,238
Every single mission, you walked point.

206
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,352
At first, I thought it was
just 'cause you was crazy...

207
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,635
Then maybe because you were
the best guy in the whole world.

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,639
Or maybe because you'd
seen something that was...

209
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,316
something other than that
Ring of Hell that we were in.

210
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,076
It was because I was
the best guy in the world.

211
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,875
See, now, me?
I believe in everything.

212
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,153
You tell me there's aliens or that you've
gone for a ride on a saucer...

213
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,073
sure, why not?

214
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,072
You tell me they killed the Kennedys

215
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,551
or started the war,
and I am with you 1 00%%.

216
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,153
But what I'm sorry to hear is...

217
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,428
Is that your experience was so bad

218
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,513
that you could do what we did
without even flinching.

219
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,037
I don't know
what my experience was.

220
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,078
All I know is, my whole life is like that--

221
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,599
walking point through a jungle,
waiting for something that...

222
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,075
I can't stop to happen to me.

223
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,078
No disrespect,

224
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,591
but how does that make you
any different than anybody else?

225
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,759
How's my credit?

226
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,158
Sorry, but there's nothing
I can do in that regard.

227
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,074
Willie, I saved your life. Come on.

228
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,879
Two times.

229
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,439
Now I'm gonna save yours.

230
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,955
Get straight.

231
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,152
I don't wanna get straight, Willie.
I wanna get high.

232
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,477
I know, you want to get taken
to that other world.

233
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,033
Well, that costs money.

234
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,753
I'm good for it.

235
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,791
You're not good for nothing,

236
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,195
same as every other junkie
I do business with.

237
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,637
That is why I am
strictly cash-and-carry.

238
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,556
Get straight, and I'd be happy
never to see your face ever again.

239
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,397
If you get some money,
then I'd be happy to accommodate you.

240
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,995
(train passes by)

241
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,192
(church bell chimes)

242
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,716
(children laughing)

243
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,878
We're expecting a telegram.

244
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,116
From Los Angeles, California?

245
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,671
Your telling me again
doesn't make it get here any quicker.

246
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,075
You're the people
that are digging in the woods?

247
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,958
Yeah.

248
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,798
What are you looking for?

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,275
Do you know about the Indians
who used to live out here?

250
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,550
A little bit.

251
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,990
We're trying to find out
more about them.

252
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,519
It's five even.

253
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,109
You gonna be getting the hell
out of there any time soon?

254
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,956
Why are you people so hostile?
We're not doing anything.

255
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,878
You got a home with a backyard?

256
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,195
I got a backyard, yeah.

257
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,149
You go outside, people digging
potholes all over the yard,

258
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,596
maybe digging up things
better left buried,

259
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,870
how are you gonna feel about it?

260
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,074
Thanks.

261
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,073
(door closes)

262
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,836
NEWSCASTER:
Apollo 1 3 got into trouble

263
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,315
shortly after 1 0. 00
eastern time last night.

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,070
Something happened which cut off
the power and oxygen supply

265
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,349
in the command ship.

266
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,519
At midnight. the astronauts were told
to use the moon-landing ship.

267
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,917
At 3. 42 a. m.. they were ordered
to make the critical firing

268
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,633
to put the mission in an orbit...

269
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,877
Do you think this was an accident?

270
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,718
If I had to weigh our friends' propensity

271
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,078
to interfere against
NASA's growing incompetence,

272
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,753
I think I'd have to go with NASA.

273
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,030
... made their last
television broadcast to earth.

274
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,836
SECOND MAN: Last night.
after 1 0 p. m. eastern standard time...

275
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,189
What?

276
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,158
Nothing.

277
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,755
If you were still in charge,
you would have used this

278
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,918
as further proof
of that imminent invasion.

279
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,553
Probably.

280
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,993
(doorbell rings)

281
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,395
... the hypothesis
for Houston at this point

282
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,070
is that it may have been caused
by a collision with a meteoroid

283
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,715
or an explosion on the aircraft...

284
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,956
- Sam.
- Hey, Dad.

285
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,309
What a surprise.

286
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,470
What the hell are you doing here?

287
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,193
Dad said he lost his job.

288
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,068
Right. Like you care about that.

289
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,675
What do you want, Sam?

290
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,074
How's Julie?

291
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,710
She's pregnant. What do you want?

292
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,070
Pregnant. Well, congratulations.

293
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,874
You came home to gloat, didn't you?

294
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,036
You came home because
he lost the organization.

295
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,834
You still think he's
some sort of a god, don't you?

296
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,600
He craps on you for 21 years,
you keep coming back for more.

297
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,152
- You don't know what you're saying.
- I'm talking about lies, Eric.

298
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,629
I'm talking about this.

299
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,273
A guy named Tom Clarke
says he devoted his life

300
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,079
to exposing
the government UFO hoax.

301
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,072
People see something
strange in the sky,

302
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,357
the government makes them think
it's a UFO, not some secret plane.

303
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,075
People taken in the middle of the night
and filled full of mind-altering drugs.

304
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,719
Must have been cosmic visitors.

305
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,559
It sure wasn't our government
testing some new chemical weapon.

306
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,393
Is that our legacy, Eric?

307
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,712
Is that what he's been doing--
covering for these creeps?

308
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,114
OWEN: What creeps?

309
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,358
Tom Clarke. I should have known.

310
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,432
You know him?

311
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,152
Our paths have crossed. I spent
a lifetime building my organization.

312
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,951
- With one prank, he took it away.
- It wasn't the prank. It's the times.

313
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,037
Nobody cares about this
science-fiction stuff.

314
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,710
Real monsters are running this country,
killing innocent people.

315
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,194
Oh, right, son.

316
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,512
There were no monsters
in my generation. No killing.

317
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,836
You're my son!
This is your inheritance he took!

318
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,075
I don't want any part of that.

319
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
- Then why did you come home?
- I was asking the same question.

320
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,589
If you don't give a damn,
why did you come home?

321
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,430
(sliding door opens)

322
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,434
What is it?

323
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,673
Part of your inheritance.

324
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,595
Is it true? Are you really in charge
of some UFO project?

325
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,036
No. absolutely not.

326
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,792
Guess I could have changed
the combination, but...

327
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,072
I always thought when you were ready,
you'd come home.

328
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,228
I found this at a crash site
in New Mexico.

329
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,790
What crashed
was nothing man-made.

330
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,710
Inside this craft were five beings.

331
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,070
They were not human.

332
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,555
Three of them were dead,

333
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,194
the fourth one died under
observation, and the fifth...

334
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,073
Everything I've done since I found
this wreckage has been about this--

335
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,631
trying to understand who they are
and what they wanted.

336
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,830
I was wrong about the crop circles,
but I'm not wrong about this.

337
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,234
Something is about to happen.

338
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,153
Maybe next week,
maybe in 30 years,

339
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,074
but these visitors--they're moving
towards something.

340
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,792
It's really true, isn't it?

341
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
Dad, you had no right
to hide the truth like that.

342
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,350
Do you know what
would've happened in 1 947

343
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,599
if the country had believed we were
about to be attacked from outer space?

344
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,075
I don't know, the growth
of a military-industrial complex?

345
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,351
Senate hearings to determine
if you were or had been

346
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,595
an alien sympathizer?

347
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,279
Maybe we would have started
to invade countries

348
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,591
we thought succumbed to the menace.

349
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,992
I can't abide a mess.

350
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,836
And what about now?

351
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,634
You've kept this from the world
for 23 years, Dad.

352
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,395
Don't you think it's time
you told the truth?

353
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,075
I've only been frightened
once in my adult life.

354
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,476
Would you like me
to tell you about that time?

355
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,756
That fifth one...

356
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,080
the survivor of the crash
that was never accounted for...

357
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,513
I tracked him down
to a small town in Texas.

358
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,757
He had formed a bond there
with a young woman,

359
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,076
And years later,
I went back to that town.

360
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,830
The woman
was not that young then.

361
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,678
She had two grown children,

362
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,275
and she also had a 1 0-year-old son,

363
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,592
the result of her bond with this stranger.

364
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,155
Her older son Tom is the one
who made that crop circle.

365
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,118
He did it deliberately
to destroy me.

366
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,080
Well, I guess he had his reasons.

367
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,874
I got close to the Clarkes.

368
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,197
I wanted to know more
about the younger boy--Jacob.

369
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,073
I was bringing him back
to the ranch when it happened.

370
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,516
He was a strange boy.

371
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,276
He was gentle,
and he was withdrawn.

372
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,912
When I looked in this boy's eyes,
Sam, what I saw--

373
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,671
what I saw there was
all my memories and all my fears.

374
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,474
More than that, I saw them add up.
Do you understand?

375
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,796
I saw my own death, Sam.

376
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,592
I saw how I would die.

377
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,233
Maybe it was a moment of guilt.

378
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,676
You know, maybe what you saw...

379
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,592
Is what you know you deserve.

380
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,079
Well, there's your story, son.

381
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,797
Your big scoop. A Pulitzer
while you're still an undergraduate.

382
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,072
And all you have to do
is make someone believe you.

383
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,075
(chattering)

384
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,111
Hi. Do you know where I can find
some information on the dig site?

385
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,919
Yeah, I do. Who are you?

386
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,599
Oh. Sam Crawford.

387
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,835
Sarah. How're you doing?

388
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,076
I'm a journalism student
from UC Berkeley.

389
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,038
Uh, Dr Powell?

390
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,550
This is Sam Crawford.
He's a journalism student.

391
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,716
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

392
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,630
- Is that the carbon-dating report?
- Yeah.

393
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,159
Well, how old's our body?

394
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,156
It's about...six years old,
give or take.

395
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,074
Yeah. The wrappings
are bed sheets.

396
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,236
They date back
to the early 1 960s.

397
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,035
Lab estimates 1 964,
but they can't tell for sure.

398
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,275
We should've known.

399
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,152
There was nothing Tsimshian
about the burial.

400
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,629
They never wrap their dead.

401
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,400
The glyphs were indecipherable,
not their language at all.

402
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,995
Actually, I was hoping
I could talk to you about that.

403
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,237
What did you make of the writings
you found in the burial chamber?

404
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,112
It was no language
we've been able to identify.

405
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,670
Yeah, probably no more real
than our mummy.

406
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,199
I gotta go find the sheriff.

407
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,079
Sam, you're welcome to stick around.

408
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,674
- Thanks.
- Okay.

409
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,353
ALLIE: I remember my mum
telling me

410
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,955
that she only went
to church once with her mother

411
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,434
on Easter Sunday.

412
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,039
When the minister said

413
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,549
that the kingdom of heaven
was within her.

414
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,113
that scared her half to death.

415
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,830
It meant it was all up to her.

416
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,508
People want the comfort
of strong arms.

417
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,071
They look to the voices
in their heads. to drugs.

418
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,912
They look to the sky.

419
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,557
- Hey.
- Hey.

420
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,189
I can see you didn't take
my advice about getting clean,

421
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,068
so I have to say to myself...

422
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,037
maybe the man's got some money.

423
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,359
I got these.

424
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,993
What are they?

425
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,679
They're my dad's medals.

426
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,314
What the hell are you doing?

427
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,599
- Get a doctor.
- MAN: Right away.

428
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,991
I want you people packed up
and out of here by tomorrow morning.

429
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,794
Sheriff, we've got to be able
to come to some sort of compromise.

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,592
This is a significant
archaeological dig.

431
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,070
I don't care. I want you gone.
Where's the mummy?

432
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,471
Can I ask you something?

433
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,069
You say this mummy might be
evidence of a murder.

434
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,074
That's generally the case
when somebody hides the body.

435
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,960
Then aren't you supposed
to say, "Don't leave town,"

436
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,913
instead of, "Get out of town by sunrise"?

437
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,793
You find that helps you as you
make your way through life?

438
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,069
Being a wise-ass?

439
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,833
DARYL: Hey, Dr Powell?

440
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,073
The mummy was here
just a minute ago.

441
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,034
Well, it didn't just get up
and walk off by itself, now, did it?

442
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,596
Hey, look at this.

443
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,155
(thunder)

444
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,360
(raven caws)

445
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,355
Mosquitoes starting early
this year, huh, George?

446
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,352
Hmm...

447
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,115
I read somewhere that mosquitoes
have killed more people

448
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,193
In the history of the world, the way
they spread disease and all,

449
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,068
than all the wars, famines,
and floods put together.

450
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,078
Hard to believe something like that.

451
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,073
I don't know why I buy this stuff.
It doesn't work at all.

452
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,314
Champ!

453
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,036
Champ!

454
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,072
Champ!

455
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,555
Champ.

456
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,716
Champ.

457
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,753
You know what I like to do
for mosquitoes?

458
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,916
I like to get garlic and motor oil

459
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,829
and rub it all over any part of me
that's gonna be exposed.

460
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,077
I never have any trouble
with the little bloodsuckers.

461
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,079
Bye, Louise.

462
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,998
Honey, would you put...

463
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,394
Wendy?

464
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,838
Wendy?

465
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,957
Wendy?

466
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,194
Wendy?

467
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,233
Wendy, l--

468
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,993
Wendy. Wendy!

469
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,072
Wendy!

470
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,388
Wendy!

471
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,033
Wendy!

472
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,549
(raven cawing)

473
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,753
Wendy!

474
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,033
Wendy!

475
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,433
She knows not to go
in the woods.

476
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,071
She has been told,
and she has been told.

477
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,790
Louise, it's gonna be all right.
Kids wander off all the time.

478
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,069
We find them.

479
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,554
Not in these woods.

480
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,390
DR POWELL: They walk among us
in many shapes,

481
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,795
and their ways are not
always what we would hope.

482
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,993
So to understand that which is not you,
you must become that other thing.

483
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,556
My grandmother said, "Walk a mile
in another man's shoes."

484
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,274
That is the greatest secret
to shape-shifting.

485
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,753
So it's not about the disguise,
it's about knowledge.

486
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,996
You guys really gonna leave
in the morning?

487
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,430
Well, we really don't have
much of a choice.

488
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,073
It was a good dig, sir.

489
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,392
Even without the body, you've done
some important work here.

490
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,591
We were only just getting started.

491
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,235
Yeah.

492
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,073
Nature call.

493
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,278
- Not very subtle, are they?
- Nah.

494
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,640
You really wanna look
at the writing on the wall?

495
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,508
-Yeah.
- Let's go.

496
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,195
- Daryl, you wanna join us?
- Okay.

497
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,919
You sure you wanna do this?

498
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,917
I'm not a virgin,
if that's what you mean.

499
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,793
I'm not talking about that.

500
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,434
I'm saying, you sure you wanna wander
into the deep, dark woods

501
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,071
when there's something out there?

502
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,078
What do you think happened?

503
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,238
Tana leaves. The curse.

504
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,352
He's been revived.

505
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,551
He's coming for you, Sarah.

506
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,069
Cut it out. That's not funny.

507
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,434
(kissing)

508
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,911
Dr Powell, is the raven
considered a trickster

509
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,599
or a shape-shifter?

510
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,396
Daryl, are you looking for a grade here,
or do you really want to know?

511
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,074
A little bit of both.

512
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,079
All right. Fair enough.
Trickster is both good and bad.

513
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,475
He brings man knowledge
of the universe as it is.

514
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,669
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.

515
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,075
Okay, so Jack Tales
and Loki and Daffy Duck

516
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,078
are all examples of trickster gods.

517
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,550
What could be trickier
than shape-shifting?

518
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,070
Right. Like when Daffy
pretended to be a skunk.

519
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,835
That was Sylvester,
and he spilled paint on his back,

520
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,519
but, yeah, you get the point.

521
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,388
Wow. You sure that wasn't Daffy?

522
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,189
Because the duck,
he's always getting into something.

523
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,160
I get the feeling this all
means something to you.

524
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,073
(Sarah screams)

525
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,356
Stay here and watch our stuff.

526
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,835
Where are they?

527
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,268
Let's check up here.

528
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,199
You want to get that light
out of my face?

529
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,555
Sorry.

530
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,270
- These two belong to you?
- Yeah.

531
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,595
You okay?

532
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,075
She's fine, but if you're
gonna be so jumpy

533
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,351
you scream in the face
of every old man you meet,

534
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,950
you shouldn't be walking in the woods
in the middle of the night.

535
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,068
Trickster.

536
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,078
The trickster.

537
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,390
(makes cawing noises)

538
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,112
Dr Powell?

539
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,400
I was just messing around, man.

540
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,075
Hello?

541
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,311
Buzz?

542
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,078
This isn't funny, man.

543
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,513
(branch snaps)

544
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,830
Hello?

545
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,030
Dr Powell?

546
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,712
Dr Powell?

547
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,953
RADIO: The safe return
of the Apollo 1 3 astronauts

548
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,277
who splashed down in the Pacific
near the USS Iwo Jima.

549
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,075
The astronauts were immediately
flown by helicopter to the Iwo Jima,

550
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,072
where a medical doctor
examined them.

551
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,350
President Nixon
watched the final moments

552
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,152
of the Apollo 1 3 on TV

553
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,471
and then announced
that he will fly to Houston

554
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,070
to pick up families of the astronauts
and continue on to Hawaii

555
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,073
where he will award the astronauts
with the Medal of Freedom.

556
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,069
- How are you feeling today, Frank?
- Better. Feeling better.

557
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,759
Miss? Miss, I got this itch
that really needs scratching.

558
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,473
You slept through the night.

559
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,999
- First time.
- I know.

560
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,150
Thought you might be up
for some solid food.

561
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,597
I've got something solid right here.

562
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,316
Looks like Johnson's hungry.

563
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,511
Hungry?

564
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,070
Aah! Aah!

565
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,074
No, no.

566
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,352
Do they still have those guys
in the park who sell hot dogs?

567
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,713
Uh-huh.

568
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,073
DR POWELL: But, sheriff,
Daryl's vanished.

569
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,879
He's been gone all night.

570
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,672
Is he a citizen of Haysport?
No, he's not.

571
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,196
So his disappearance
is not my problem.

572
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,989
- What do you mean, not your problem?
- Who are you?

573
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,760
I'm Sam Crawford. I'm a reporter.
I'm doing a story on the dig.

574
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,188
Not anymore, you're not.

575
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,637
Look, sheriff, last night,
there was an old man

576
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,068
prowling the woods with a shotgun.

577
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,069
One of my students has disappeared,
and you're not going to do anything?

578
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,877
Tell you what--you file a report...
I'll keep my eyes open.

579
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,349
Right.

580
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,919
It's starting again, Kerby. Isn't it?

581
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,268
(laughter)

582
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,116
ALLIE: When you're a kid.
anything can take you away--

583
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,919
soap bubbles

584
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,396
or a hose spraying a rainbow
up over a new-mowed lawn.

585
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,273
I guess growing up means
that it gets harder and harder

586
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,194
to find your way back
to that kind of place

587
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,079
where you can be taken.

588
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,719
The one time I see grownups

589
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,354
with that same sort of look
on their faces

590
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,069
is when they're just
at first falling in love.

591
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,072
It changed a lot
while you were away, huh?

592
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,078
I wasn't really thinking about that.

593
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,596
I was just thinking
about all those bubbles.

594
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,399
They're beautiful, aren't they?

595
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,314
Yeah. Those kids look really happy.

596
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,355
What happened?

597
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,070
A lot of things.

598
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,356
- In the war?
- I don't know.

599
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,870
That was just
the icing on my cake.

600
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,075
(screams)

601
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,869
No! Get your kids out of here!

602
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,389
What do you want from me?!
Why do you keep taking me?!

603
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,074
Why did you save me
in the jungle?!

604
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,879
Why didn't you
let me die with my men?!

605
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,672
Frank! Frank!

606
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,355
Jeez, man. Lighten up.
It's not my war.

607
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,712
Come on.

608
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,069
Oh, my God.

609
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,074
Man can't make a damn bubble
in the modern world.

610
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,072
Come on. It's okay.

611
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,675
Frank. Frank.

612
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,070
Hey, it's okay. You can tell me.

613
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,992
My name's Amelia, for God's sake.

614
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,760
I was named after
somebody who was lost.

615
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,273
Can I ask you
to do something for me?

616
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,993
Would you call me Jesse
instead of Frank?

617
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,679
Frank's not my real name.

618
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,075
Maybe someday I can explain.

619
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,512
Excuse me, miss. I'm looking
for Lieutenant Frank Pierce.

620
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,155
Ridley, Personnel Services Office.
Records Branch.

621
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,152
You're a difficult man to find.

622
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,075
- I've been sort of preoccupied.
- You never picked up your medals.

623
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,313
I have a Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart.

624
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,078
- Keep 'em.
- Excuse me?

625
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,948
Give them to someone
who deserves them.

626
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,839
- You don't want them?
- I don't want 'em.

627
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,994
Okay.

628
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,591
I read the report on this, lieutenant.

629
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,870
What you did--
it's a miracle you survived.

630
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,991
The temple was on fire.
You couldn't save everyone.

631
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,873
I don't know if you blame yourself
for the men you couldn't save,

632
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,593
if that's what this is about--

633
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,309
It's about that
and a lot of other things.

634
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,073
I'm not gonna take your medals.

635
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,955
Well, we'll just add that to the list.

636
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,512
The list of things you're gonna
explain to me someday.

637
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,315
You like it, being a nurse?

638
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,188
I was in college. I knew everything
that was wrong with the world.

639
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,955
I wasn't doing one little thing
to make it better.

640
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,549
What about you? Did you
always want to be a soldier?

641
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,036
I always figured I'd be a mechanic,
like my dad.

642
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,959
- What happened?
- We're different in that way.

643
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,037
I stopped thinking I could fix things.

644
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,639
(horn honking)

645
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,795
WOMAN: Look out!

646
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,429
You okay, buddy?

647
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,153
Steve, you little idiot!
What were you doing?

648
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,595
Why don't you think?

649
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,074
Ma'am, I think he's scared enough.

650
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,715
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

651
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,956
- You okay?
- Yeah.

652
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,269
You're very brave.

653
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,072
No, I'm not.

654
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,556
It's not brave when you know
nothing can hurt you.

655
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,273
What do you mean?

656
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,078
Someone's watching over you?

657
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,875
You got a guardian angel
or something?

658
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,195
Or something.

659
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,078
Is that what happened
in Vietnam, Jesse?

660
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,038
You thought you couldn't get hurt?

661
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,437
No. I knew I couldn't get hurt.

662
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,790
We were in the Quang Ngai
province, and...

663
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,195
we walked into a trap.

664
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,718
Knowing what I knew,
knowing that I was safe...

665
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,195
I should've been able to do more.

666
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,834
I dared them the whole time,

667
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,271
saying, "Go ahead.
Get me out of this one."

668
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,079
And they did.

669
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,715
They got me out.

670
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,593
And they let 27 men from my unit die.

671
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,273
Who are "they", Jesse?

672
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,193
Who are you talking about?

673
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,992
Add that to your list, too.

674
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,349
Okay, guys.

675
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,120
The only way to cover enough ground
before nightfall is to split up.

676
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,795
Any problems, blow your whistles.

677
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,958
Keep blowing until the rest of us
can get to where you are.

678
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,310
Sam's offered to help us look.

679
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,875
One more thing--
someone has to stay here,

680
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,073
just in case Daryl comes back
while we're out looking for him.

681
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,269
I will.

682
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,632
Thanks, Sarah.
You might want to keep this.

683
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,796
Let's go, you guys. Be safe.

684
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,079
Daryl!

685
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,358
Daryl!

686
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,913
Daryl, it's Dr Powell.

687
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,473
Daryl?

688
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,678
Daryl!

689
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,078
Daryl!

690
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,079
Daryl.

691
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,751
(caws)

692
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,552
Daryl.

693
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,270
(footsteps)

694
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,434
Hello?

695
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,068
Is anybody there?

696
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,830
Hello?

697
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,199
Daryl!

698
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,274
You in there?

699
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,595
Hello?

700
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,193
Any word yet?

701
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,669
Nobody's been back?

702
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,156
This is deeply creepy.

703
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,232
Yeah. Deeply.

704
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,754
Look, I better go back out.

705
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,071
You wanna take this?

706
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,673
You should keep it.

707
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,713
Okay. Okay.

708
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,314
(twig cracks)

709
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,432
(whistle blows)

710
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,551
DR POWELL: Aahhh!

711
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,830
(gunshots)

712
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,071
(sobbing and whimpering)

713
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,517
You take care of the problem?

714
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,711
Yeah.

715
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,275
He'd just gotten to Powell
when I came on him.

716
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,715
I shot him twice.

717
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,592
No body?

718
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,150
There was blood all over.
I figured he'd crawled away to die.

719
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,152
You figure, or you hope?

720
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,596
Come on, doc.
I told you, I shot him twice.

721
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,793
You didn't want to make sure,
just in case you were wrong?

722
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,228
What are you looking at, old man?

723
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,312
You ain't helping,
creeping around the woods.

724
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,950
You're damn lucky
you're still alive!

725
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,434
I need some help!

726
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,916
Somebody help me, please.
It's okay.

727
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,712
Shock. Nothing more.

728
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,319
She probably won't remember a thing.

729
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,312
Well, let's hope not.

730
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,075
What's going on here, sheriff?

731
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,828
What paper did you say
you worked for again?

732
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,389
Well...it's a college newspaper.

733
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,233
Uh-huh. Well...

734
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,791
next time an officer of the law
makes a suggestion to you,

735
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,558
like "Go Away," for example,

736
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,155
you should think about listening.

737
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,714
If I see you again,

738
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,070
I'm gonna drive you
out into the woods,

739
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,709
and I am gonna shoot you. Go away.

740
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,148
SARAH: His eyes...

741
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,514
He came through
the burial chamber...

742
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,070
His eyes...

743
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,960
oh, God.

744
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,593
His eyes.

745
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,470
(twig cracks)

746
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,555
You're all right.

747
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,832
When I found you,
I thought you might be dead.

748
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,235
Then I noticed you were
still breathing, so l...

749
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,073
I dragged you in here

750
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,477
to keep you out of
the elements and such.

751
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,999
Who the hell are you?

752
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,077
My name's Leo.

753
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,155
My daughter's name was Nadine.

754
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,073
She would've been 40 this year.

755
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,155
We got the northern lights
up here,

756
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,074
but in 1 958,
there was something in the sky

757
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,516
that wasn't
any aurora borealis.

758
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,752
There were these lights
in the sky...dancing,

759
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,474
moving in ways
you wouldn't believe,

760
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,396
coming down out of the sky
and disappearing into the woods.

761
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,191
My Nadine went walking in there,
trying to see what they were.

762
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,597
She came back
a day and a half later,

763
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,995
no idea where she'd been,

764
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,191
no idea what had happened to her.

765
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,029
It was about four months
after that she started to show.

766
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,509
The twins were born in early '59.

767
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,438
The pregnancy was hard, real hard,
and the birth killed her.

768
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,274
I was Nadine's only family,
so I took the boys.

769
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,353
I named 'em Larry and Lester.

770
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,072
They were all wrong, those boys,
right from the start,

771
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,436
but it wasn't just that.

772
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,030
It was how they looked
and what they could do.

773
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,678
They could peer inside a fellow,
even when they were small.

774
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,075
When I looked in this
boy's eyes. what I saw...

775
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,836
what I saw there was
all my memories and all my fears.

776
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,635
After a little while, it got too hard
for us to stay in town.

777
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,474
Folks just didn't
want them around, so...

778
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,199
we went out into the woods,

779
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,068
stayed in this cabin my father
had built for hunting trips--

780
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,078
How much did you tell him, Leo?

781
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,879
Well, doesn't really matter.

782
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,551
We're gonna take that drive
I promised you.

783
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,438
(thunder)

784
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,269
(hums)

785
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,318
You killed one of the twins,
didn't you?

786
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,432
You killed him, you wrapped him up
and stuck him in that chamber.

787
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,714
Larry. He was the worst of the two.

788
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,388
Took to trying out his abilities
when he was 1 6 years old.

789
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,791
Leo mention that? Hmm?

790
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,434
All the dead dogs and cattle?

791
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,400
Things he did to them hunters
in the woods.

792
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,791
This town makes its living
off of hunting season.

793
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,072
Close to ten years, couldn't
pay folks to go in our woods.

794
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,078
Leo wouldn't go near
that cabin himself.

795
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,829
It's my job to keep this town
safe for everybody.

796
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,349
That boy was a menace.

797
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,070
I went up there to try
to talk some sense into him.

798
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,476
Anyway, I didn't wrap him up.

799
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,831
I buried him under a tree.

800
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,352
How he wound up in that burial pit,
wrapped up like that...

801
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,875
I got some ideas.

802
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,273
Come on! Get after him!

803
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,069
KERBY: Damn it!

804
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,835
Where'd he go?

805
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,076
This way. Come on.

806
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,639
(gasps)

807
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,752
Can you come with me?

808
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,068
Lester?

809
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,115
MAN: It's the sheriff.

810
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,750
Whoa. Whoa.

811
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,993
Louise, what the hell is going on?

812
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,474
We're going in after him, Kerby.

813
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,274
My daughter's still missing,
and we know who's responsible.

814
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,750
All right, let's go.

815
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,077
(shouting)

816
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,919
Over here.

817
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,629
She's hurt bad.

818
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:28,039
Must have tried to climb a tree
to see where she was, and she fell.

819
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,471
Her leg's broke
in a couple of places.

820
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,753
I sneak up when she's asleep,
leave her food and water,

821
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,916
but I can't get her into town.

822
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,113
I'm afraid she'll look at me.

823
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,231
What happens
when people look at you?

824
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,949
I don't know, exactly.

825
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,597
When my brother and I were kids...

826
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,758
we used to just scare folks, mostly.

827
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,428
I think people look at us,
they see too much.

828
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,115
All their memories.

829
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,071
All their fears.

830
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,878
I guess you could say.

831
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,230
Why'd you wrap
your brother up like that?

832
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,269
My brother and l...sometimes...

833
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,070
we would draw
in this weird language.

834
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,838
We never knew what it meant,

835
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,556
but it looked kind of like in books
and stuff about ancient Egypt.

836
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:40,870
Yes.

837
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:47,474
I knew it was important,
like...maybe magic or something.

838
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,793
I thought maybe if l...
wrapped him up like that,

839
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,037
put him somewhere special
with that writing all around him...

840
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,912
Maybe he'd come back to life.

841
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,431
Kind of foolish, huh?

842
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,030
No. No, Lester, I don't think
that's foolish at all.

843
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,913
I think you loved
your brother very much.

844
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,269
I never meant to hurt

845
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,109
any of those people
who dug up the grave.

846
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,432
I was trying to get help for the girl.

847
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,311
I know.

848
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,474
My, uh...

849
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,515
Whatever it is I do to people...

850
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,839
I guess it got stronger
after Larry died.

851
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,600
I really never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

852
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,599
(groans)

853
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,915
You're hurt, too.

854
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,270
I gotta get you both to a doctor.

855
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,072
Just worry about the little girl.

856
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,435
Hi.

857
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,119
Hi.

858
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,556
Are you the one who's been
bringing me food?

859
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,193
No, sweetheart. I'm not.

860
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,828
Is that him over there?

861
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,075
I wanna say thanks.

862
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,914
His name's Lester.
You can thank him later, okay?

863
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,872
Right now, I'm gonna
have to pick you up,

864
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,991
but it might hurt a little,
so can you be brave?

865
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,596
(mob shouting)

866
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,149
Hey, stop!

867
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,078
The little girl's here! She's all right!

868
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,908
Stop! Stop pouring the gas!

869
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,433
We're coming out!

870
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,877
Come on, sweetie. It's okay.

871
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,915
Come on. All right.

872
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,238
Mister?

873
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,550
Thank you.

874
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,793
You're welcome.

875
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,390
Oh, God. Baby.

876
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,110
Oh, my God.
Baby, did he do this to you?

877
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,078
No, mummy. I fell out of a tree.

878
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,838
Get her back to the car, Louise.

879
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,076
We're gonna finish this
once and for all.

880
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,072
Why don't you
let me take it from here?

881
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,915
Eric. What are you doing here?

882
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,714
You're not a hard man
to follow, Sam.

883
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,115
From everything the sheriff
and Dr Shilling have told me,

884
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,636
you've got something
important to the project--

885
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,115
some sort of half-breed
or something.

886
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,469
That's why you're here?

887
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,070
I'm here to keep you from doing
anything unfortunate.

888
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,232
The sheriff says
you've been uncooperative.

889
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,670
Look, there's nothing here for you.

890
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,030
I think I'd like to see for myself.

891
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,719
Eric, you can't go in there.

892
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,512
You're going to stop me?

893
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,069
You could be killed.

894
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,590
You care about me, Sam. I'm touched.

895
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,314
He's right, son.
You don't want to go in there.

896
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,799
- Eric, no.
- Get your hands off me!

897
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,399
I'm not gonna let you take him!

898
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,837
Lester don't want to hurt anybody.
Get out of here.

899
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,155
Step away from the porch, Leo.

900
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,073
Mummy, are they gonna hurt Lester?

901
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,549
Hush, honey.

902
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,955
I let you people
take my boys before,

903
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,832
and look where it got me.

904
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,632
No, sir. I'm not moving.

905
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,031
Well, suit yourself.

906
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,994
Come on!

907
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,997
MAN: Get that gasoline on it.

908
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,679
Mummy, no!

909
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,075
You want him now, little brother?
He's all yours.

910
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,398
Lester, you gotta get out of here.

911
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,712
Larry didn't mean
to hurt anyone, either.

912
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,476
They came out with cameras
to take pictures of the freaks.

913
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,154
Larry just lost his temper.

914
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,231
We gotta go!

915
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,710
What's the point?
Where am I gonna go?

916
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,070
- We'll figure something out.
- You better get out of here.

917
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,435
Lester, come on.

918
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,749
(Sam screaming)

919
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,349
Oh, my goodness!

920
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,788
(baby cooing)

921
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,310
There you go.
Grandpa did that, didn't he?

922
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,995
Yes, you're very cute.

923
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,430
Hi, Mary.

924
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,756
Come on. Can you say "grandpa"?

925
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,075
Can you say "grandpa"?

926
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,754
She's only a week old.

927
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,235
Can't start
indoctrinating them too soon.

928
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,074
Come on, Mary. "Grandpa."

929
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,713
Come on. "Grandpa."

930
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,231
I wish your brother Sam
was here to see this.

931
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,075
Say "grandpa."

932
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,310
Come on.

933
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,071
Julie, could you give
dad and me a minute?

934
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,395
Yeah.

935
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,958
I bring my baby over for you to see,
you're still talking about Sam.

936
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,072
We haven't heard from him
since he left.

937
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,430
We won't be hearing
from him anymore.

938
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,759
Sam is dead.

939
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,029
What?

940
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,959
He went out trying to find proof
that would destroy you,

941
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,912
and that proof killed him.

942
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,553
He died trying to bring you down.

943
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,034
He hated you that much.

944
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,392
You never told me any of the things
you told Sam.

945
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,636
I would never have broken
your trust,

946
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,070
and you never once
gave it to me.

947
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,868
This...

948
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,719
is this what you saw

949
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,111
when you saw your own death?

950
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,834
(screaming)

951
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,076
(heart beating rapidly)

952
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,074
No! Aah!

953
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,436
A stroke, right?

954
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,433
A massive explosion.
"Pop" goes the brain stem.

955
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,631
That's why you always hated me.

956
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,593
I scared you.

957
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,076
You knew I was the last thing
you'd ever see.

958
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,668
Kind of funny, isn't it?

959
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,315
If you'd been a little kinder,
showed a little more interest,

960
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,914
this might not have happened.

961
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,829
Knowing what you know--
that's what brought us here.

962
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,714
So, how does it end, Dad?

963
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,514
Are you trapped in there?

964
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,316
Stuck inside your head
a while longer

965
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,590
before the lights finally all go out?

966
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,351
I always loved you better.
You know that.

967
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,199
You wet yourself.

968
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,074
Marry me.

969
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,880
That goes in the kitchen.

970
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,355
Master bedroom, please.
Thank you.

971
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,949
Thank you.

972
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,035
Shut the door on your way out.

973
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,231
OWEN: Eric. I guess
I was wrong about you.

974
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,710
Good luck and Godspeed.

975
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:35,989
Dad.

976
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,076
# If my words did glow #

977
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,910
# With the gold of sunshine #

978
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,793
# And my tunes were played #

979
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,197
# On the harp unstrung #

980
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,070
# Would you hear my voice #

981
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,035
# Come through the music? #

982
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,392
# Would you hold it near #

983
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,875
# As it were your own? #

984
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,311
# It's a hand-me-down #

985
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,077
# The thoughts are broken #

986
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,753
# Perhaps #

987
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,076
# They're better #

988
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,914
# Left unsung #

989
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:43,157
# I don't know #

990
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,909
# Don't really care #

991
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,633
(raven caws)

992
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:54,073
# Let there be songs
to fill the air #

993
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,391
# La da da da #

994
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,149
# La da da-da da #

995
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,911
# La da da da #

996
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,351
# La da da da da #
