689
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,745
The point is not

690
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:39,181

696
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:57,033
Hi, folks.
Before we begin taping today...

697
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:59,366
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Peter Jenks...

698
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:01,668
of the Federal
Communications Commission.

699
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:02,900
OK?

700
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:08,410
Thank you, Mr. Barris.

701
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:28,524
I don't know if any of you
are aware of this...

702
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,527
but it's a federal offense...

703
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,130
to make lascivious remarks...

704
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:38,074
on a television
network broadcast.

705
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:43,440
The penalty...

706
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,449
for this disgusting...

707
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:56,226
un-American... behavior...

708
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:59,321
is one year in prison...

709
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:02,094
or a $10,000 fine...

710
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,896
or both:

711
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:09,036
Anyone...

712
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:13,134
making a sick subversive
remark tonight...

713
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,270
will be arrested immediately.

714
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:17,008
l, then,
will personally escort...

715
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:18,640
the offender
to federal prison...

716
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:21,584
for booking
under edict number 364...

717
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,077
of the Broadcasting Act
of 1963.

718
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:29,890
And it's a long drive
to that prison, baby.

719
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:32,829
Just you and me.

720
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,424
No witnesses:

721
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,318
CHUCK:
OK. Lave fun. Evenybody.

722
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:55,785
All niglt.

723
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:58,788
They gave everybody jackets
with their names on them...

724
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:01,951
and when we got number one
ratings on Saturday nights...

725
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:03,654
everybody got a gold plaque.

726
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:06,186
And so, he was a good boss...

727
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,061
and obviously
had the common touch...

728
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,398
because he really knew
what people wanted to watch.

729
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:14,462
BARRIS: We ained
and becamme a big lit.

730

732
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:21,473
[Sighs]
I got a story to tell you.

733
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:23,241
- Asshole.
- I know, I know.

734
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:26,250
Uhh. I got
a little story for you.

735
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,478
LORETTA: I'm busy.
We're in the middle...

736
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:28,917
of a bachelorette crisis
out there.

737
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,477
CHUCK: Sit down, relax.

738
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:33,081
Take a load off.
Make yourself at home.

739
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:34,523
I just got a call
from the network.

740
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,254
- You want a drink?
- You got any weed?

741
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,058
CHUCK: I wisl. No. No weed.

742
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,394
Then I'll have a drink.

743
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:41,398
[Chuck sighs]

744
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:42,797
LORETTA: Bad news?

745
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,268
"The Tammy Grimes Show" is being
pulled from Saturday night.

746
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:48,500
- Oh, not Tammy.
- Ha ha ha ha.

747
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,097
They want me to put
a primetime version...

748
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,006
of "The Dating Game"
on in its place.

749
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:56,310
- That's fucking great.
- Yeah, it's great...

750
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,974
but they say the daytime version
is not hot enough.

751
00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,916
They want me to make it
more exciting for nighttime.

752
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,885
I got 48 hours.

753
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:05,251
LORETTA: Wlat lave you got?

755
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,820
I don't have a clue.
I got nothing. Bupkus.

756
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:12,989
Tlis is a big deal. Lonetta.
My big bneak.

757
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:16,831
I know. [Exhales]

758
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:20,904
- Don't blow it.
- Oh, thanks for the help.

759

[Slow jazz music playing]

761
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,688
JIM: Let me
ask you something, Chuck.

762
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:47,562
Jesus. What the...
What are you doing here?

763
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:48,963

[Scoffs]

767
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:58,803
Have you noticed, Jim?
I got a TM show on the air.

768
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:00,572
I don't need to kill people
for hire anymore.

769
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:03,671
I know you don't need to,
but you like to.

770
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,148
Bullshit.

771
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:08,516
Think of it as a hobby...
something you do to relax.

772
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:11,522
You can be
an assassination enthusiast...

773
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:12,648
a murder bug.

774
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,351
I got important things
to think about here.

775
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:15,654
I don't have time
to fuck around with you.

776
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,718
This is serious work
we're talking about, Chuck...

777
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,923
serious work.

778
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:22,364
How about I help you out
with your little show...

779
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,027
you help me out
with my little operation?

780
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:25,831
Tit for tat.
That's the kind of guy I am.

781
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,202
Oh, yeah.
You're a piece of work.

782
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,934
I've seen this "Dating Game"
of yours, Chuck...

783
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,271
and I do have a thought.

784
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:34,210
What, now you're
a big television producer?

785
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,645
JIM: I'm John Q. Public
when it comes to TM...

786
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,912
and that should make my opinion
of value to you.

787
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,011
CHUCK: All right,
let's hear it, then.

788
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:45,352
JIM: What do you have?
Some couple gets sent...

789
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:47,880
to some second-rate
shit-can restaurant...

790
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,586
setting you back 50 bucks?

791
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:50,992
That's not
too exciting a prize...

792
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:53,792
for us vicarious living boobs
out in TM land.

793
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:56,265
- What's your point?
- Up the stakes, Chuck.

794
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,131
Send them
to some exotic locale...

795
00:40:58,169 --> 00:41:01,832
Europe, Southeast Asia,
for example.

796
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:04,606
The network's not going
to let me send...

797
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:06,405
two unmarried kids
on vacation together.

798
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:08,435
JIM: Send them with a chaperone.

799
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:12,949
CHUCK: That's...

800
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:18,782
That's not half bad.

801
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,450
JIM: I'm telling you.

802
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:23,324
Sometimes you could be
the chaperone.

803
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,693
Say we have a job
for you in Austria.

804
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,665
You, a successful
television producer...

805
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,996
chaperones a young couple.

806
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:32,696
While there, you take care
of some company business.

807
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:34,204
It's a perfect cover.

808
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:37,537
TM producer by day,
CIA operative at night.

809
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:38,701
I got money, Jim.

810
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:41,439
I don't have to kill people
for money anymore.

811
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,310
Chuck, when I said
you fit the profile...

812
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:46,248
very little of that meant
you needed the money.

813
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:50,118
You liked it with Renda.
I saw it in your eyes.

814
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:52,486
You liked it,
but you botched it.

815

The only way
