00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:33,409

6
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,964
(distant sirens wailing)

7
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:50,438
- [Man] Steve man, come on.

8
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:52,473
Come on let's go!
- To hell with you guys.

9
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:53,473
I'm staying!

10
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:55,879
What's the matter?

11
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,520
(zapping)
(energy sizzling)

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,410
- Howdy, folks, come on into James Bar.

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,050
We got everything you
want, beer, whiskey, crack,

14
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,380
heroin, it's all here, you name it.

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,270
It's all legal and it's
all here, so come on in.

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,240
Bring your wife, bring your girlfriend,

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,073
bring them both.

18
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,440
- [Man] Hey, Jenny, hey.

19
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,800
- Alright, now how many times
do I have to tell you guys

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,050
no drinks on the table.

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,030
- Get out of here, you mooch.

22
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,380
I'll give you a lead enema.

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,540
- I think table three
could use more nachos.

24
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,273
- Put that away, dick head.

25
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,672
- Relax.

26
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,570
- That thing's hot, man,

27
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,450
that's the piece I used
to cap that old man.

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
- There's nothing to worry
about, we got away clean.

29
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:22,943
(tense music)

30
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:55,647

00:02:56,823 --> 00:03:00,100

32
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,767
(cyber beeping)

33
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,266
- What the hell is that?

34
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:22,030
- I am Unit Seven of the Federal
Division of Core Trackers.

35
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,950
You, Frank Douglas Rowe, have
been found guilty of murder

36
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,740
by the United States
Computerized Judicial System,

37
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,420
in accordance with penal code 1-2-0-0-6-7.

38
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,545
- Now wait a minute!
- You are to be executed, now.

39
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:36,770
(suspenseful music)
- I'm innocent!

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,850
You got the wrong guy!

41
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,353
The wrong guy!

42
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,057
Oh, help me man, help me!

43
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,501
(gun firing)

44
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,499

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,710
(tense music)

50
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,241

51
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,014
(cyber beeping)

52
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,395
- [Man] Hey!

53
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:34,974
(tires screeching)

54
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,974
(suspenseful music)

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,490
- You James Donald Cooley
have been convicted

56
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,270
of murder by the United States
Computerized Judicial System.

57
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,090
In accordance with penal code 1-2-2-0-6-7,

58
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,100
you are to be executed, now.

00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:45,286
(protestors clamoring)

66
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:57,671
- No more, no more!
(whistling)

67
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,107
- No more!

68
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:02,274
(helicopter chuffing)

69
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,130
- He's here.

70
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,230
Secure your positions.

71
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,912
(tense music)

72
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:26,079
(helicopter chuffing)

73
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:41,764
- No more, no more, no!
- No more!

74
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:46,764
(protestors clamoring)
(eerie tense music)

75
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:58,720
(protestors clamoring)
- No more!

76
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,620
- Hi I'm Connie Griffith from Internews.

77
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,130
Outside Cybercore Industry
teams of protestors

78
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,240
gather to express their disapproval with

79
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,400
the country's newly appointed

80
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,260
Computerized Judicial
System, a faction created by

81
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,940
Cybercore, and inducted
into the judicial system

82
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,290
eight months ago.

83
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,520
The strongest supporter
of computerized justice

84
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
is Senator Bob Dilly,
who is making his way

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,110
into the press conference
podium right now.

86
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,119
- [Bob] Hi, how are you,
really nice to meet you.

87
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,619
(tense music)

88
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,657
- Ladies and gentlemen settle please!

89
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,890
(protestors booing)
It is my pleasure to introduce

90
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,468
Senator Robert Dilly.

91
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:36,560
(applauding)
(protestors booing)

92
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,410
- Position check.

93
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,570
- Stage right secure.
- Stage left secure.

94
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,990
- Thank you, thank you very much,

95
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,910
it's a, welcome, why
don't we, why don't we

96
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,190
open it up for questions right away.

97
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,540
- Senator Dilly, don't you feel that

98
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,110
computerized justice is
a blatant demoralization

99
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,710
of the constitution?

100
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,590
- I feel that computerized justice,

101
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,110
is a misuse of terms.
- Computers can't make

102
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,360
life and death decisions!

103
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,320
- Justice isn't run by computers,

104
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,280
it is organized and
distributed by computers,

105
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,730
but those computers
were programmed by men!

106
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,040
- Computers killed my brother!

107
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,850
- You're killing people!
(protestors shouting)

108
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,680
- We're tight boys, got a lot of

109
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,915
angry little faces out here today.

110
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,415
(tense music)

111
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:27,630
- Well what about the Constitution?

112
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,060
- The Constitution was
written over 225 years ago,

113
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,690
when the entire country had less of

114
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,870
a population than this city.

115
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,330
- [Man] Ross this is Romero,
we have a security guard here

116
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,519
that says we have an unauthorized
vehicle in sector five.

117
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,140
Want you to check it out.

118
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,920
- Negative, it's too hot down here.

119
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,020
- It might be something.
- Stay the line.

120
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,810
- Danner, cover me I'm gonna check it out.

121
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,260
- Phillips stay at your post!

122
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,590
- [Phillips] I got a feeling Ross.

123
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,150
- There are 20 murders a day in this city.

124
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,537
That's a hell of a lot of trials.

125
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:02,740
A lot of trials, a lot of manpower,

126
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,334
a lot of money that we just don't have.

127
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:07,834
(tense music)

128
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,690
- Are you sure we're doing
the right thing Nick?

129
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,720
- Yes dammit, from (mumbles).
(mechanism clacking)

130
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,870
- Killing Dilly ain't
gonna stop the system.

131
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,020
- No, but it'll slow it down.

132
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,740
- It's a statement.
- We're going through

133
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,710
with the plan.
(tense music)

134
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,490
- Phillips come in.
- Phillips!

135
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,610
- What's going on?
- A-2-7 unauthorized

136
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,030
vehicle on the roof, code yellow.

137
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,603
Secure.

138
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,370
- Senator Dilly, do you
think that Mr. Rounds,

139
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,510
as Chairman of Cybercore,
would care to reveal

140
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,210
how much money his company made when they

141
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,320
merged with the United States government?

142
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,140
- Miss Griffith, that
question has no bearing

143
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,580
on this news conference.

144
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,280
We are here to discuss cybernetics,

145
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,870
the wave of the future,
the wave of justice.

146
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,900
You want to talk about preventing deaths?

147
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,010
How about preventing the
deaths of innocent policemen

148
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,550
killed in the line of duty?

149
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,790
Core Tracker is the first
step in preventing that.

150
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,370
- So we file in all the facts and let the

151
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,060
computers come up with the verdict.

152
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,450
- Yes Miss Griffith, and the
sentence is then carried out.

153
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,140
- By robot executioners.
(protestors clamoring)

154
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,130
- By Core Tracker.

155
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,480
- Mark, Matt, two minutes.

156
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,550
- What's next Mr. Dilly, cyborg
teachers, cyborg doctors?

157
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,800
- How about cyborg reporters?

158
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,780
- Mr. Dilly do you feel
the cybernetics industry

159
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,500
is advanced enough for this
type of responsibility?

160
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,080
- I feel Cybercore.

161
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,441
They are the spearhead
company in the field.

162
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,671
- [Man] You're lying Senator,
why are you lying to us?

163
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,812
- [Bob] Every legal
explanation is (mumbles).

164
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:59,812
(tense music)
(Bob lecturing)

165
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:05,690
Nothing had been uncovered (mumbles).

166
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,868
- [Connie] Senator what
happens when (mumbles).

167
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,945
- Faith, faith is for churchgoers.

168
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:15,195
(mumbling)

169
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,877
There's nothing to worry about.

170
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:24,953
(suspenseful music)

171
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:26,600
- Guard!
(grunting)

172
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,751
(dramatic choir singing)

173
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:33,751
(grunting)
(hits thudding)

174
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:39,660
(gun firing)

175
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,964
(water splashing)

176
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:46,881
(hits thudding)
(grunting)

177
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,368
(machine gun firing)

178
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:57,570
(screaming)
(glass shattering)

179
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,570
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

180
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,721
(gun firing)

181
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:11,447
(machine gun firing)

182
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:16,447
(gun firing)
(machine gun firing)

183
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:18,877
(grunting)

184
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:23,514
- Hold on!

185
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:26,572
(helicopter whirring)

186
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:28,310
(machine gun firing)

187
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,893
(somber music)

188
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,077
(siren wailing)

189
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:55,568
(tense music)

190
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:04,021
(rocket whooshing)
(explosion booming)

191
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,660
(tense music)

192
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,182
(machine gun firing)

193
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:16,099
(tires screeching)

194
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,222
(machine gun firing)

195
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:53,587
Secret Service, get out of the car!

196
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:56,632
(uneven tense music)

197
00:13:56,632 --> 00:14:00,540
(machine gun firing)
(siren wailing)

198
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
(tires screeching)

199
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:07,615
(machine gun firing)

200
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:12,193
(crashing)

201
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:18,243
(metallic rumbling)

202
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:24,734
(explosion booming)

203
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:35,313
(tense music)
(siren wailing)

204
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:50,916
(somber music)
(police radio chattering)

205
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,150
- The terrorists are said to be members

206
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,820
of a covert radical group who
oppose computerized justice.

207
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,460
They call themselves UHR,
Union for Human Rights.

208
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,250
Some people may disagree with the tactics

209
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,970
they displayed here
today, but other people

210
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,460
believe they are necessary.

211
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,240
Meanwhile we just had
confirmed reports that

212
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,020
all UHR members were killed.

213
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,570
I'm Connie Griffith, reporting.

214
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,423
- No...

215
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,840
- [Man] Senator do you feel
this was a UHR incident?

216
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,080
- Of course it was a UHR attack.

217
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,480
Union of Human Rights indeed, what a joke.

218
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,760
What about my rights?

219
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,850
Aren't I human?

220
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,340
- Were you hurt Senator?

221
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,874
- No I wasn't, and I owe that to Eric.

222
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:49,270
I want you to meet Agent Eric Phillips,

223
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,530
he's the head of our
Secret Service detachment.

224
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,363
Good work.

225
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,210
- Do you intend on striking back sir?

226
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,840
- We'll let the law take care of that.

227
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,480
Well, that's all for now boys.

228
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,130
- Okay we get it.

229
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,090
- [Man] I got it.

230
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,199
- [Man] Goodnight Senator.

231
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,230
(reporters chattering)

232
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,780
- Let's get one thing straight.

233
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,300
You've been with the team
for what, three months now?

234
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,750
You and your bunch of SS boys are

235
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,040
nothing more than, window dressing.

236
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,000
I've been Head of Security
for the senator for six years.

237
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,290
- Then you should have
checked that car out

238
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,790
and called in the code yellow.

239
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,610
- Well you know I don't need to explain my

240
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,030
actions to you Phillips,
but, when I'm operating

241
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,960
with a limited team, I don't have time to

242
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,570
check out every nook and cranny!

243
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,660
- If the senator gets killed,

244
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,110
your excuses are gonna
look great on your resume.

245
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,250
- Well I'll tell you what.

246
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,010
You ever leave your post
again, you'll answer to me.

247
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,580
(laughing)

248
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,480
- Great work Eric!

249
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,249
- Thanks Senator, just doing my job.

250
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,660
(chuckling)

251
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,960
- Just doing your job huh?

252
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,670
You saved my butt twice in one day.

253
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,460
Better watch out for this kid.

254
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,260
We'll see you tomorrow.

255
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,760
- [Ross] I'm telling you Senator,

256
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,580
I don't think he's ready yet.

257
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,810
- Well he sure was ready this afternoon.

258
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,810
More than I can say for you, by the way.

259
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,610
- We don't know enough about this guy,

260
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,160
we don't know how loyal he is!

261
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,600
- We know how good he is.

262
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,800
He showed us that today.

263
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,080
What are you afraid
of, are you afraid he's

264
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,970
better than you, afraid he's gonna take

265
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,920
your job away Ross?

266
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,530
- Phillips is nothing
more than an impulsive,

267
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,480
hot-headed amateur.

268
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,960
Now I think bringing him into the fold

269
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,810
at this time is a big mistake.

270
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,200
- This kid has got something special,

271
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,500
and I want him on my side!

272
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,900
If we have trouble with
him I want to find out now!

273
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,300
Before he gets in too close.

274
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,900
- Well if that is the
case, and he is a problem,

275
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,150
then you leave him to me.

276
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:11,130
(brooding music)
- Okay.

277
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,210
- Lights Agnes.
- Good evening sir.

278
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,543
Welcome home.

279
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,540
- Any messages?
- None sir.

280
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,280
- So what else is new?

281
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,290
- How was your day?

282
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,860
I see.

283
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,570
Intranews said you saved
the senator's life today.

284
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,760
- Yeah I'm a real hero.

285
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,160
- I detect a touch of sarcasm.

286
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:54,480
- (sighs) That's what
I like about you Agnes,

287
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,040
you're perceptive.

288
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,090
- Have I done something to upset you sir?

289
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,743
- No I'm sorry.

290
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,050
How was your day?

291
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,080
- Enjoyable.

292
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,210
I refused my faulty Ebbins circuit

293
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,140
and Mr. Perkins next door replaced

294
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,680
his old terminal with a new Mary 6000.

295
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,410
She's a charming little
system, we had a nice chat.

296
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,660
- Want a drink Aggy?

297
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,780
- I really shouldn't.

298
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,110
- (sighs) Come on, we got
the whole night ahead of us.

299
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,160
Let's get drunk.
- We did last night,

300
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,060
you just got more depressed.

301
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,090
- Come on, indulge me.

302
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,920
- Okay, no higher than 5%.

303
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,617
(beeping)

304
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,660
(cyber whirring)

305
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,790
Eric, I said 5%.

306
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,313
This is too much, perception--

307
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:49,020
(beeping)
What was I going to say?

308
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,220
- You love me.
- I love you Eric.

309
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,387
(sighing)

310
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:58,051
(pensive music)

311
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:05,040
- Aggy.
- Agnes 4000,

312
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,640
yes that's my name, don't overdue it,

313
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,430
I mean wear it out (giggles).

314
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,540
- Recall November 23rd,
2014, 11:34 p.m., camera six.

315
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,620
- [Agnes] Oh Eric (hiccuping).

316
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,900
- Excuse you.
- Why do you want

317
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,990
to punish yourself?

318
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,450
- I didn't ask for your opinion Agnes.

319
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,283
- Very well.

320
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,420
(poignant music)

321
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,253
- Hi.

322
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:39,677
What are you making?

323
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,073
- [Woman] Stew.

324
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,340
It's your favorite.

325
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,873
- Aren't you gonna turn around?

326
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:51,970
- [Woman] I saw it on the news.

327
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,623
- I'm okay.

328
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,010
- [Woman] You're always okay.

329
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,130
- Are you all right?

330
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,953
- I'm sorry.

331
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,523
- Why?

332
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,200
- Another scar to add to your collection?

333
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,850
- I'm all right!
- Well I'm not!

334
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm married to a man whose
job is to be willing to die

335
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,460
at any given moment, for any given reason!

336
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,430
- Jeez do we have to
keep going through this?

337
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,930
- What kind of a life is that?

338
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,000
- You knew what I did when you married me!

339
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,833
- No!

340
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,550
You were an investigator
when I married you,

341
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,380
not, not a bodyguard!

342
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,250
Look I just can't live
my life waiting for you

343
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,890
to walk through that door dead or alive.

344
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,260
- Hey don't talk like that just relax!

345
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,060
- There's no point in arguing, is there?

346
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,669
(strained music)

347
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:05,700
I love you.

348
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:16,010
I love you.

349
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,584
I love you.

350
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:43,202
(poignant music)

351
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,903
- Agnes water.

352
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,171
(water splashing)

353
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,410
I love you too Katy.

354
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,380
Aggy, sleep.

355
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,630
(whirring)

356
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,568
(zapping)

357
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:50,072
(crickets chirping)
(brooding music)

358
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,092

360
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,791
(door clattering)

361
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,000

362
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:28,650

(gasping)

363
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,567
(injector hissing)

364
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,940
- Eric, Eric!

365
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,970
Wake up!
- What is it?

366
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,012
- Priority call, Senator Dilly.

367
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,512
(tense music)

368
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,240
- Hello?
- Hi Eric it's Bob.

369
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,684
Something's come up, would
you please come down here?

370
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:51,517
- Yes sir.

371
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,692
(tense music)

372
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,390
- Sorry to get you out
of bed so early Eric.

373
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,200
- What's wrong Senator?
- Well I know you've

374
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,870
only been with us for a short time,

375
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,840
but you're really becoming
part of the family, right Mike?

376
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,940
- Yes sir.
- And this is a family, Eric.

377
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,560
It's tight like a family.

378
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,700
There's certain information,
that we share with each other,

379
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,520
that we don't share with
everybody else, right Mike?

380
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,910
- Yes sir.
- See loyalty is

381
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,360
what makes a unit strong, impregnable,

382
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,740
unbreakable loyalty.

383
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,980
Some of us have it, some of us don't.

384
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,219
(dramatic music)

385
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,580
We're talking about loyalty.

386
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,162
You haven't learned about.

387
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,090
(gasping)

388
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,510
- What are you doing?

389
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,230
- Tried to have me killed.
- What?

390
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,983
- Your boss isn't too
happy about it either.

391
00:26:11,983 --> 00:26:14,290
- (gasps) I didn't have
anything to do with that!

392
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,230
- Save it Miss Austin,
we know all about you!

393
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,770
We've been following you, we know that

394
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,940
you're a member of the Union!

395
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,530
- No, no I don't have anything
to do with the Union--

396
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,363
- Save it!

397
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:29,110
(dramatic music)

398
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,943
Relax Eric!

399
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,500
Relax!

400
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,310
- No, don't trust him!
- This woman knew

401
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,614
abut the assassination attempt.

402
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,660
- He's crazy!
(tense music)

403
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,873
Psychopath!

404
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,760
You're out of your god damn mind!

405
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,909
Cybercore has to be stopped!

406
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,851

407

(dramatic music)

408
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,420
- Don't fire, the building isn't empty!

409
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,180
Stay with me Ross!

410
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:08,146
(hits thudding)
(grunting)

411
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:33,000

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,880
give me an APB on Eric Phillips.

413
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,810
- Isn't he one of yours?

414
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,400
What are the charges?

415
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,233
- Murder.

416
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,520
- You have proof?

417
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,990
- You'll find a body in his
apartment, Wilshire and Third.

418
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,300
Gun on the floor has
his prints all over it.

419
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,470
- His prints or hydrosanc copies?

420
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,340
- Come on Chief, since when were you

421
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,640
so concerned with details?

422
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,490
Just do your job, keep the peace.

423
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,400
I'll meet at CRC in 20 minutes,
we're sending out a tracker.

424
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400

427
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:23,070
- [Man] Why don't we talk
to him, this way, come on.

428
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,670
- I need to see the
chief, it's an emergency.

429
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,890
- Take a seat.

430
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,900

431
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,380

432
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,213
Take a seat.

433
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,730

478
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,590
Is that necessary?

479
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,380

00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:14,321
(whirring)
(electronic clicking)

539
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:16,988
(cyber beeping)

540
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:26,188
(eerie humming)
(rapid beeping)

541
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,393
- I'm with Secret Service!

542
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:38,532
(cyber beeping)
(suspenseful music)

543
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:43,199
(gun firing)
(grunting)

544
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,792
(siren wailing)

545
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,459
(cyber beeping)

546
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:52,633
- Stop the truck!

547
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:55,367
Get off!

548
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:01,963
(tires screeching)

549
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,242
(siren wailing)

550
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,992
(dramatic music)

551
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:13,831
- I am Unit Five.

552
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:18,063
I am Unit Five.

553
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,679
(crashing)

554
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,976
(rumbling)

555
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:39,586
(explosion booming)

556
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:42,503
(flames crackling)

557
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:47,807
(beeping)
(whirring)

558
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:52,586
(popping)
(fizzing)

559
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:55,378
You are to be executed,
you are to be executed,

560
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:58,229
you are to be executed,
you are to be executed,

561
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:01,104
you are to be executed,
you are to be executed,

562
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:04,027
you are to be executed,
you are to be executed,

563
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:06,868
you are to be executed,
you are to be executed,

564
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,809
you are to be executed,
you are to be executed,

565
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,250
you are to be executed, you are

566
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,131
- No, you are.
- to be executed, you are

567
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,516
to be executed, you are to be executed,

568
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:17,362
you are to be executed--
(gun firing)

569
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:20,445
(distorted mumbling)

570
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,000
- Drop the gun and get in the van!

571
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,480
- Who are you?
- Do it, now!

572
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,454
- What do you want?
- Just get in the van, now!

573
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:36,862
(injector hissing)
(groaning)

574
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:39,112
(thudding)

575
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:45,214
(crickets chirping)
(footsteps echoing)

576
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:47,420
- I know, but I want him brought in now!

577
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,320
I mean now!
- I have an APB

578
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,400
out on him, my people think
he's a cop killer now.

579
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,550
So if he's out there, we'll find him.

580
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,160
- Oh, he's out there Chief Olsen.

581
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,890
- Then it's only a matter of time.

582
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,290
- We need another tracker.

583
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,290
- Another tracker?

584
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,730
- We need it to get
Phillips, he's a threat.

585
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,560
- Of course he is.

586
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,930
He saw you kill someone.

587
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,920
- If he's a threat to
me, he's a threat to you,

588
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,780
if you know what I mean.

589
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,670
- Let me give you a piece of advice.

590
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,110
Never over-estimate the power of a man.

591
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,490
Jenny, have a seat.

592
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,110
Men are not men anymore.

593
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,350
Tribalism is dead, and
mankind is soon to follow.

594
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,710
Men are a bug, and what
do we do with bugs?

595
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,950
We crush them.
- What are you

596
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,783
talking about?

597
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,720
- I'm talking about power.

598
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,700
The power over life, over
the meek, the meager,

599
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,550
the spiritless, the hollow, vacant eyes

600
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,570
of our brain-dead children.

601
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:06,020
(gasping)

602
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,380
I'm talking about the power over death!

603
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:11,490
(grunting)
Over the masses,

604
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,630
over the sheep that require domination,

605
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,960
the society that has grown so dependent on

606
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,850
being told what to do, it hasn't even

607
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,876
the courage of a thought.

608
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,126
(grunting)

609
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:29,840
We're in a new generation.

610
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,650
A generation of soul-less
zombies, trained to obey,

611
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,220
to seek nothing.

612
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,095
(beeping)
(gas hissing)

613
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:51,095
(eerie tense music)

614
00:41:57,623 --> 00:41:59,500
What more could a god want?

615
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,690
- [Announcer] Now more
from Connie Griffith!

616
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,330
- [Connie] The Secret
Service agent apparently

617
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,760
disappeared after the body was
found inside his apartment.

618
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,320
Here with me now is Mike Ross,

619
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,390
Head of Cybercore Security.

620
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,520
Mr. Ross would you say
Phillips appeared to be

621
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
on the edge the night of the murder?

622
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,440
- No, just flipped out,
a total break-down.

623
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,560
You know this guy's a loose cannon,

624
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,440
and while he's out there on the street,

625
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,240
no one's safe.
- Thank you.

626
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
- Especially you Ross!

627
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,390
- The police have issued
a state-wide manhunt

628
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,370
for Phillips, if you
have any knowledge of his

629
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,020
whereabouts, please contact
the local authorities.

630
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,882
From Cybercore, I'm Connie
Griffith, for Internews.

631
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:40,520
(slamming)

632
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,900
(grunting)

633
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,910
- Hey pal, alls you had to do was knock!

634
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,743
- Where am I?

635
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,130
- Hey man I...

636
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,450
You're safe.
- You're not!

637
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,600
Now tell me where I am!

638
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,690
- I can't say.
- Who can?

639
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,000
- Griff, but Griff aint here yet.

640
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:14,710
(door clattering)
- Right there asshole!

641
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,630
Gil I told you to keep that door locked!

642
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,050
- I did!
- Just ease down cowboy!

643
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,740
Just ease down!

644
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,580
- He's looking for Griff.
- Yo, Griff ain't here.

645
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,740
- Look, I just want somebody to tell me

646
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,650
what the hell's going on here!

647
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,030
- Look, I'm sorry, we can't
tell you what's going on yet.

648
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,860
Please just try and be patient!

649
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,151
We're not gonna hurt you!

650
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:45,270
- (scoffs) Well tell him that!

651
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,450
- Jared please put the gun down!

652
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:50,950
- (sighs) Guy's dangerous,
we can't trust him!

653
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,140
- I'm dangerous?

654
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,450
You're the one with the gun.

655
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:01,300
You guys are UHR aren't you?

656
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,290
- Yeah, yeah, we're fucking terrorists!

657
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,910
- Look, we are with the Union,

658
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,190
but we'll explain everything to you

659
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,460
as soon as Griff gets here.

660
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,410
- Who's this Griff?

661
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,370
- Get back in the room.

662
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,700
- Jared, put the gun down.

663
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,120
- He was on their side Marcus!

664
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,370
- Well he's not any more!

665
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:22,291
- We don't know that!

666
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:26,555
- Kid, put the gun down!

667
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:28,840
(tense music)

668
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,340
Or I'll take it away from you.

669
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:32,049
- Try it.

670
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,916
(mechanism clacking)

671
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,090
- Now, where's Griff?

672
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,590
- [Connie] Right here.

673
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,239
(pensive music)

674
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,500
- Big TV star has a secret life huh?

675
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,600
- Something like that.

676
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,140
Marcus, take care of his leg.

677
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,210
- Relax, I'm a med student.

678
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,640
- What I need is a doctor!

679
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,440
- Yeah well you're shit out of luck.

680
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,770
- Jared go in the other room.

681
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,210
- Griff this is a waste
of time if you ask me.

682
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,160
- I didn't ask you.

683
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,640
- You're lucky it's just under the skin.

684
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,900
I'll have to cut through to get it out.

685
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,610
- Quit talking about it, just do it!

686
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,570
- There's only one problem.

687
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,970
I don't have any anesthetic.

688
00:45:39,478 --> 00:45:41,978
(tense music)

689
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,080
Hang in there buddy.

690
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,440
- Ow, jeez!

691
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,613
- Connie!

692
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:04,016
- Try to relax, you'll be okay.

693
00:46:04,016 --> 00:46:07,349
(distant siren wailing)

694
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:12,870
(grunting)

695
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,190
- Career woman like you must
have everything she wants.

696
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,960
(grunting)

697
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,260
What are you doing at UHR?

698
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:21,824
- Try to make a change.

699
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:24,450
(groaning)

700
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,930
- Sounds pretty sappy to me.

701
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:26,780
- Didn't ask you.

702
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:31,138
- Okay, I got it!

703
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:32,221
- Is that it?

704
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:36,033
It felt a lot bigger.

705
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,130
(clanking)

706
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:45,397
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

707
00:46:45,397 --> 00:46:48,147
(brooding music)

708
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,570
(energy pulsating)
(suspenseful music)

709
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,166
(beeping)

710
00:47:18,024 --> 00:47:21,191
(electronic clacking)

711
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:27,943
(gasping)

712
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:31,026
(eerie serene music)

713
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,088
- I've been a reporter for eight years.

714
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:43,780
And I've seen the worse man has to offer,

715
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,830
I watched the White House burn down,

716
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,260
I covered the massacre
of Greenwich Village.

717
00:47:50,145 --> 00:47:51,890
But the worst horror
is that people becoming

718
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:54,350
more and more desensitized
to it all and it's,

719
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,050
it's led to this judgment by computer

720
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,170
that we all accept
without a second thought.

721
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:02,691
We're becoming programmed by
the machines we've created.

722
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,050
And you know what it's
not gonna get any better

723
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,992
until we get our justice back.

724
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:09,410
(distant siren wailing)

725
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,710
- Killing the senator, isn't
gonna help your cause any.

726
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,060
- I didn't authorize that Phillips.

727
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,040
I was working with a connection
working inside of Cybercore.

728
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,990
- Stephanie Austin.

729
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,098
- Yeah.

730
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,680
Well she's uncovered
some heavy information,

731
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,280
something called Operation Echo.

732
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,050
But before she could get
it off their computer,

733
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,883
she was...

734
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,653
- Murdered.

735
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,580
- We know you were set up Phillips.

736
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,620
- What is this information?

737
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,548
- I don't know.

738
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:43,381
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

739
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:45,060
All I know that she was
willing to die to get it out,

740
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,160
and now it's up to us
to try to retrieve it.

741
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,360
- You have someone else working inside?

742
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,760
- No.

743
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,670
- Well you don't really think you can get

744
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,430
inside that place do you?

745
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,300
- No, but you can.

746
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,760
You've been part of Dilly's security team

747
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,940
for three months, you can't tell me

748
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,960
that you've never been
inside of Cybercore.

749
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,880
- Yeah, dozens of times.

750
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,660
But I had clearance.
- Then you know where

751
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,170
the central operations lab is.

752
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,530
- Yes, but we can't get in.

753
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,394
- We can with this.

754
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:12,700
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

755
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,153
Maintenance door access code
I got it from Stephanie.

756
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:18,070
(computer beeping)

757
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,597
- You people really do have
a death wish don't you?

758
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:26,820
- Look Phillips, time is running out!

759
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,920
Cybercore is working its
way deeper and deeper

760
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,430
into our government,
and pretty soon they are

761
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,870
gonna be untouchable, do you understand?

762
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,960
We gotta move now!

763
00:49:35,437 --> 00:49:36,984
And the way I see it,
you have two choices.

764
00:49:36,984 --> 00:49:39,958
Either you can keep on running
or you can fight with us!

765
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,791
What are you gonna do?

766
00:49:44,593 --> 00:49:47,676
(eerie serene music)

767
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,908
(cyber beeping)

768
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:02,241
(whooshing)

769
00:50:05,098 --> 00:50:07,765
(cyber beeping)

770
00:50:33,432 --> 00:50:36,182
(engine revving)

771
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,200
- Phillips takes out another one of these

772
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,730
mechanical monsters, Rounds
is not going to be happy.

773
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,480
- Eric Phillips is dead by sunrise.

774
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,710
- Why don't you let me
guarantee that personally?

775
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,320
- Oh no no no no no,
it might be questioned.

776
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,380
We're playing this by
the book, he's a fugitive

777
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,780
and he's sentenced to death.

778
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:19,320
(footsteps echoing)

779
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,270
- [Jared] What the hell
do you mean, you told him?

780
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,980
- We could use him Jared!

781
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,380
- He could be using us,
did you ever think of that?

782
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,310
This could be a setup!
- They're hunting him Jared!

783
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,610
They're trying to kill
him, this isn't a setup!

784
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,413
You're losing it man!

785
00:51:33,413 --> 00:51:35,090
Relax!

786
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,000
- This guy's the best chance
that's come our way yet.

787
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,650
We are not going to let him
slip through our fingers!

788
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,250
- So, is he in?

789
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,410
- I don't know.

790
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,822
- No, Jess listen to her honey.

791
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,580
- Mom when are you coming home?

792
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,380
- (sighs) Not till tomorrow.

793
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,930
Now do as Lisa says and
stop teasing the cat okay?

794
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,510
- Okay.

795
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,787
- I'll see you in the morning.

796
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:09,787
- I love you mom!
- I love you too sweety!

797
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,383
Goodnight!

798
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:26,227
(brooding music)

799
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:38,257
(distant siren wailing)

800
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:41,257
(keyboard clacking)

801
00:52:47,186 --> 00:52:52,186
(computer beeping)
(keyboard clacking)

802
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,210
- Wanna see something?

803
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,480
Stephanie Austin was a
close friend of mine,

804
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,810
she got a hold of some
cyber text data for me.

805
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,577
Here, take a look at
what we're up against.

806
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:18,577
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

807
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,890
The tracker's endo-system
is some kind of hi-tempered

808
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,170
super alloy, I mean, I'm
not a metallurgist but,

809
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,430
it's far more impermeable than

810
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,280
any metallic compound I've ever seen.

811
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,690
My software can't decipher
the hydroxic radical

812
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,860
that was utilized.

813
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,366
Any theories?
- Uh, I only speak English.

814
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:38,210
(chuckling)

815
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,530
- Sorry.

816
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,250
Basically, these trackers...

817
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,700
- Real bad asses.

818
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,373
- Right, but what's really spectacular,

819
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:48,380
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

820
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,510
is the circuitry.

821
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,730
There's got to be over a billion
individual microprocessors.

822
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,380
And what's really mouth watering,

823
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,340
is this polymorpha-nuclear substance.

824
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,445
- You lost me.

825
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,880
- (chuckles) Yes I did that's my point.

826
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,480
The tissue content is some type of

827
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,670
poly-muric gel that acts as a protectant

828
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,740
yet offers complete flexibility.

829
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,000
You could put your hand right inside it,

830
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,650
but you couldn't actually puncture it.

831
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,410
This fucking surpasses and (mumbles)

832
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,350
dimensions beyond any
analytical, technical

833
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,170
or otherwise formulated
systematical perceptions

834
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,260
or deductions of, of any principles,

835
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,921
or methods of fucking science!

836
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:29,838
(computer beeping)

837
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:34,843
I'm lost too.

838
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,070
- Yeah, well, thanks.

839
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,020
- What I'm saying is, that this gel,

840
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,420
that cyber-tech has created,

841
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,010
is the perfect substance!

842
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,650
The Core Tracker is the perfect android.

843
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,100
The perfect assassin.

844
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,870
- Oh there you are, Connie
wants to see you okay?

845
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,523
- Wait!

846
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,565
How old are you anyway?

847
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:15,065
(distant siren wailing)
- 19.

848
00:55:16,697 --> 00:55:19,063
- Well shouldn't you be
in school or something?

849
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:21,200
(sighing)

850
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,400
- Well if I was in school right now,

851
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,800
I couldn't be here, now could I?

852
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,493
(dramatic music)

853
00:55:33,493 --> 00:55:35,660
(beeping)

854
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,570
- Marcus you're gonna be
on the outside perimeter.

855
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,880
Make sure the motor's running
and you're ready to go.

856
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,460
Once we're on the main laboratory level,

857
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,540
this is where it's gonna get hot.

858
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,150
We're gonna have to
split up and try to find

859
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,990
the central ops lab.

860
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,900
- No you won't, I know where it is.

861
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,390
I'm in.

862
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,740
- Oh I feel better already!

863
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,210
- What is your problem?

864
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,573
- I'll show you what my problem is!

865
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:11,220
(hits thudding)
(grunting)

866
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,780
- Phillips!

867
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,560
- Don't make me hurt you!
- Phillips!

868
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,200
One of the men you killed
at the press conference

869
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,700
yesterday was Jared's brother!

870
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,260
You killed his brother.

871
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:26,312
(sighing)

872
00:56:31,074 --> 00:56:33,030
I'm sorry, I should have told you.

873
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:37,300
- [Woman] Jared, wait!

874
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,976
- Okay, let's get everybody
ready Marcus, let's do this.

875
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:56,643
(tense music)
(beeping)

876
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,274
- Okay Dee, Jeanie!

877
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:25,228
All right let's get ready, you
two go get the van started,

878
00:57:25,228 --> 00:57:27,478
we'll be right down.
- Okay.

879
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,894
(tense music)

880
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:35,934
(ticking)

881
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:51,200
(tires screeching)

882
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,400
- [Jeanie] What was that?

883
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,233
- [Dee] I don't know, go on,

884
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:56,453
I'll check it out.

885
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:59,453
(suspenseful music)

886
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:05,672
(beeping)
(ticking)

887
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,495
Tracker!
(explosion booming)

888
00:58:09,495 --> 00:58:11,459
(screaming)

889
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:15,294
(thudding)
(groaning)

890
00:58:15,294 --> 00:58:17,229
- Oh, Jesus Christ karma!

891
00:58:17,229 --> 00:58:18,961
(crashing)

892
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,628
(cyber beeping)

893
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,750
(gun firing)
(grunting)

894
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,897
- What the hell was that?
- It came from downstairs!

895
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:33,897
(guns firing)
(dramatic music)

896
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:35,932
- Tracker!

897
00:58:35,932 --> 00:58:37,809
Let's go, move!

898
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:39,142
Let's go, hurry!

899
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:42,997
(dramatic music)

900
00:58:49,053 --> 00:58:50,053
- Oh my god!

901
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,342
(gun firing)

902
00:58:53,342 --> 00:58:58,342
(brooding music)
(gun firing)

903
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:05,157
(guns firing)

904
00:59:27,516 --> 00:59:30,767
- Go on, go on, get out of here!

905
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:31,600
Do it!

906
00:59:36,424 --> 00:59:39,007
- Oh (groans)!

907
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:51,671
- [Marcus] Come on, beat it!

908
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,171
(guns firing)

909
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:59,995
(glass breaking)

910
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:07,161
(tense music)

911
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,156
- Come on, hurry up, let's go!

912
01:00:12,156 --> 01:00:13,444
Come on!

913
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,283
(grunting)

914
01:00:15,283 --> 01:00:20,033
(gun firing)
(grunting)

915
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:44,625
(door clattering)

916
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:47,125
(guns firing)

917
01:00:57,673 --> 01:01:00,256
- Oh (groans)!

918
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,996
(suspenseful music)

919
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:14,119
(gun firing)

920
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:18,536
(zapping)
(sizzling)

921
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,014
- Here!

922
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,281
(door cracking)
How do we get out of here?

923
01:01:29,281 --> 01:01:30,920
- Try the loading dock!

924
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,003
- All right, just wait here!
- Okay...

925
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:38,249
(clattering)

926
01:01:41,286 --> 01:01:44,286
- Door's not gonna hold much longer!

927
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:46,597
We gotta get out of here!

928
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:47,514
- Get back!

929
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:50,890
(gun firing)

930
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,723
(wooden cracking)

931
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,330
(tense music)

932
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:15,594
(cyber beeping)

933
01:02:24,863 --> 01:02:29,800
(gun firing)
(grunting)

934
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,300
(guns firing)

935
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:51,835
- Come on!
(machine guns firing)

936
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,290
(guns firing)

937
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:03,514
- Eric!

938
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:06,838
Eric!
- Shoot!

939
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:07,671
- I can't!

940
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:12,671
- Safety!
(guns firing)

941
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:15,127
(ricochets clanking)

942
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:17,627
(guns firing)

943
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:31,891
(somber music)

944
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:35,056
- Cover me!

945
01:03:35,056 --> 01:03:37,556
(guns firing)

946
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,633
Jared!

947
01:03:57,287 --> 01:04:00,287
(suspenseful music)

948
01:04:04,547 --> 01:04:07,408
(doors banging)

949
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:09,431
- Want me to help?

950
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:14,431
(machine gun firing)
(explosion booming)

951
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:20,351
Jesus Christ!

952
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:24,652
It's still alive!
- Not for long!

953
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:31,363
(rocket whooshing)

954
01:04:31,363 --> 01:04:33,780
(clattering)

955
01:04:40,654 --> 01:04:41,487
Let's go.

956
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,570
- Fuck isn't this asshole dead yet?

957
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:11,420
- At least the UHR is out of our hair.

958
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,190
The tracker took them all out!

959
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:16,280
- Yeah, all except for the one we wanted.

960
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,000
- Can we get another tracker?

961
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,500
How 'bout two?
- How 'bout two?

962
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,930
Or how 'bout three?

963
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,760
How 'bout 300?

964
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,560
How 'bout we stop wasting time with these

965
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,260
mechanized meter maids,
and send in the real thing?

966
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,440
- Do you actually think
you can take him down,

967
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,010
when two trackers have failed?

968
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:36,990
- Let me tell you the forgotten difference

969
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:40,380
between man and the automated
terrors you've constructed.

970
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,800
Man has one thing
integrated into his system

971
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,260
no machine ever had.

972
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,880
The will to survive.

973
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,980
- You want him Ross?

974
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:51,843
You go get him.

975
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,623
- My pleasure.

976
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,423
(tense music)

977
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:13,691
- We gotta ditch this thing, let's go!

978
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:18,670
- They're gone, all my friends.

979
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:22,750
Jared, Ally, Gil.

980
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:25,848
They're gone.

981
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:30,390
- Come on, we gotta go.

982
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,920
- They told us never stand a chance.

983
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,210
- Connie!

984
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,330
Jared and the others
wouldn't want us to give up.

985
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,770
We can still get that
information you needed.

986
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,120
- Right, the two of us
breaking into Cybercore.

987
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,123
Sounds like you're the one with the

988
01:06:46,123 --> 01:06:47,520
death wish now if you ask me.

989
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,090
- I didn't ask you.

990
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,750
(tense music)

991
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,370
Let's go.

992
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:16,950
(footsteps echoing)

993
01:07:24,217 --> 01:07:26,717
(tense music)

994
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:28,771
Come on!

995
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:32,875
Those guards will be back any second!

996
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,958
- I can barely read this.

997
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:37,582
- Let me do it!
- I got it!

998
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:41,310
Shit does this look like an eight?

999
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,390
- Looks like a five.
- Doesn't look like five,

1000
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,430
it looks like an eight.

1001
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,490
- [Eric] Okay eight,
whatever, just hurry up!

1002
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:50,623
- I'm not exactly taking a
coffee break here Phillips!

1003
01:07:50,623 --> 01:07:52,523
(footsteps echoing)
- They're coming!

1004
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:04,319
(keypad clicking)

1005
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,260
(beeping)

1006
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,903
- You were right it was a five.

1007
01:08:06,903 --> 01:08:09,736
(door clattering)

1008
01:08:11,952 --> 01:08:13,658
How much further?

1009
01:08:13,658 --> 01:08:15,195
- Just a little bit.

1010
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:18,945
(distant machinery thumping)

1011
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:26,256
This way.

1012
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:32,737
(tense music)
(computer beeping)

1013
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:49,605
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

1014
01:08:52,723 --> 01:08:54,494
You sure you know what you're doing?

1015
01:08:54,494 --> 01:08:58,494
- (mumbles) everything he knew.

1016
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,934
(door clattering)

1017
01:09:10,592 --> 01:09:13,592
(suspenseful music)

1018
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:24,210
(dramatic music)
(hits thudding)

1019
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,301
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

1020
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:35,661
(hits thudding)
(grunting)

1021
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:37,160
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

1022
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,280
- Let's go!
- I'm almost ready!

1023
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,540
I got the file, it's restricted,

1024
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,048
I can take the disc home and
break the access code there.

1025
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:48,048
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

1026
01:09:50,513 --> 01:09:52,611
Got it!
- This way!

1027
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:55,361
(dramatic music)

1028
01:10:09,476 --> 01:10:12,056
(crickets chirping)
(police radio chattering)

1029
01:10:12,056 --> 01:10:13,010
- What do you got there?

1030
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,500
- Ah, a purse it belongs to
that chick from Intranews.

1031
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,679
And who are you?

1032
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:17,512
(hits thudding)
(grunting)

1033
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:18,580
- You're fairy godmother.

1034
01:10:19,836 --> 01:10:21,650
- [Rounds] What do you mean, stolen?

1035
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,900
- They accessed the code
and copied the file.

1036
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:28,070
- We need to know what they know!

1037
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,140
And we've got to get it back before that

1038
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,550
Internews bitch has Echo plastered across

1039
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,600
the six o'clock news!

1040
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,960
- Ross knows where they might be.

1041
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,880
He'll take care of them.

1042
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,220
- You tell Ross I need
them back here alive!

1043
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:44,491
- Fine.

1044
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,133
(waves splashing)

1045
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:03,790
(computer beeping)

1046
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:05,450
- Now I gotta break this access code and

1047
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:07,600
figure out what the
hell Operation Echo is.

1048
01:11:08,738 --> 01:11:12,874
- How long will that take?
- Minutes, hours, days.

1049
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:16,147
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

1050
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,324
- Well at least you got it narrowed down.

1051
01:11:18,324 --> 01:11:19,491
Here.
- Thanks.

1052
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,440
Where's your wife?

1053
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,303
- What?

1054
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,533
Oh the ring.

1055
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,582
I'm divorced.

1056
01:11:29,582 --> 01:11:31,630
- You still wear the ring.

1057
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:32,463
What happened?

1058
01:11:34,335 --> 01:11:36,200
- I had uh, too many scars.

1059
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,540
- I think scars are sexy.

1060
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,550
I'm divorced too.

1061
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,400
My husband said I was too aggressive.

1062
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,150
So I smacked him.

1063
01:11:48,655 --> 01:11:49,750
(chuckling)

1064
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:52,194
(keyboard clacking)
(computer beeping)

1065
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:53,470
The second we break this we are going

1066
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,360
straight to network, 'cause whatever it is

1067
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,509
we are gonna bust it wide open!

1068
01:11:57,509 --> 01:11:58,650
- Well don't get too comfortable,

1069
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,810
a lot can happen between now and then.

1070
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:03,320
- Yeah, but anyone that's
outlasted two Core Trackers

1071
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,240
has got somebody upstairs on his side.

1072
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,630
- I'm just lucky.

1073
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:10,270
- I'm Irish, ah you couldn't ask for

1074
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,646
a better combination than that!

1075
01:12:12,646 --> 01:12:15,563
(computer beeping)

1076
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,430
Oh oh this is it!

1077
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:22,783
My god!

1078
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:25,460
- I can't believe it.

1079
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:30,832
Is it possible?
- Oh it is possible.

1080
01:12:30,832 --> 01:12:32,880
(sinister music)
Her brains will be covering

1081
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,230
that wall behind you if you take

1082
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:38,314
one more glance at that gun Phillips.

1083
01:12:38,314 --> 01:12:41,175
- I thought you said you were lucky?

1084
01:12:41,175 --> 01:12:44,592
(eerie foreboding music)

1085
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,010
- Well done Mr. Ross, very well done.

1086
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,800
Very close, Miss Griffith.

1087
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,830
Closer than anyone has
ever come to me before.

1088
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,360
- I get nauseous just thinking about it.

1089
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,160
- You've proven yourself to
be one hell of an adversary.

1090
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:15,750
Mr. Phillips, you've shown
you have quite some spirit.

1091
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,030
Pity you weren't working for Cybercorp.

1092
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,361
- If I was, I'd be out of a job tomorrow.

1093
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:24,320
- Oh?

1094
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,290
And why is that?
- Because tonight,

1095
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,671
I'm gonna burn it down.

1096
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:31,171
(tense music)

1097
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,950
- Of course you are.

1098
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,840
Now then, I have one simple question.

1099
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,210
If answered correctly, it
might save you some pain.

1100
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,940
Did you make a second copy of
Echo, and if so where is it?

1101
01:13:53,498 --> 01:13:55,998
(tense music)

1102
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,833
Ross.

1103
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,360
The cat's got their tongue.

1104
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:10,680
Ross not him.

1105
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:15,130
(suspenseful music)

1106
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,710
Leaving our party, Senator?

1107
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:21,210
- I have uh, a rally at eight a.m.,

1108
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,480
and I don't want to sit here and watch you

1109
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,880
torture two people to death.

1110
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,649
I do have a touch of humanity left.

1111
01:14:27,649 --> 01:14:30,649
(suspenseful music)

1112
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,820
Say Eric, if you would have
played your cards right,

1113
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,900
you could have had his job in no time.

1114
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:46,823
- Chief?

1115
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:48,923
What about you?

1116
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,268
- I've got a few minutes.

1117
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:53,101
- Ah...

1118
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,780
(suspenseful music)

1119
01:15:06,963 --> 01:15:11,880

(Connie groaning)

1128
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:07,358
- Oh...

1129
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,280
- It's just a graze.

1130
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,322
Keep pressure here, you'll be all right.

1131
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:17,086
(footsteps echoing)
(door clattering)

1132
01:16:17,086 --> 01:16:18,472
(footsteps echoing)

1133
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:23,472
Come on!
(groaning)

1134
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,833
(tense music)

1135
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,460
- Okay Phillips it's time.

1136
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:41,440
Let's see what you got.

1137
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,640
What's the bitch, you handled those robots

1138
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,890
like a true professional.

1139
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,370
But I got news for you.

1140
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,430
I am no robot.

1141
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,370
What's the matter
Phillips, guns a problem?

1142
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,680
Like I need these.

1143
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,330
There you go, no guns.

1144
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,890
What's the matter Phillips,
you really just an amateur?

1145
01:17:17,443 --> 01:17:19,943
(tense music)

1146
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,480
- Big mistake Ross.

1147
01:17:30,757 --> 01:17:31,590
- Mistake?

1148
01:17:33,412 --> 01:17:38,329
(hits thudding)

(suspenseful music)

1157

- Don't do it!

1158
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,620
- Just an amateur.

1159
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:42,736

(hits thudding)

1161
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,550

(brooding music)

1172
01:21:16,689 --> 01:21:18,460
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1173
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,360
- I am Unit Seven, of the

1174
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,870
Federal Division of Core Trackers.

1175
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:29,780
- We got a problem.
- You Eric Anthony Phillips

1176
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,545
have been convicted of murder.

1177
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:33,914

1199
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,151
- Yeah.
(sirens wailing)

1200
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:25,984
- Got to get Dilly!

1201
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,500
- I can get to him.

1202
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,333
Come on!

1203
01:24:32,594 --> 01:24:37,594
(brooding music)
(applauding)

1204
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,450
- Thank you, thank you all for coming.

1205
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,819
After all, we are celebrating
the dawn of a new age.

1206
01:24:54,819 --> 01:24:56,380
(hits thudding)

1207
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:59,680
It's time, that we stopped
making the mistakes

1208
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,790
our ancestors have always made.

1209
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,880
It's time we stopped
being afraid of change,

1210
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,410
instead we should seek it!

1211
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:11,160
Stop being afraid of the future,

1212
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,610
instead we should embrace it!

1213
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:17,430
I tell you, the
Computerized Judicial System

1214
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:19,170
is a road to a better tomorrow.

1215
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:24,010
Cybernetics is our future.

Cybernetics is our future,
cybernetics is our future,

1220
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,150
- He's a robot!
- cybernetics is our future.

1221
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,640
- He's a robot, get, get this!
- Cybernetics is our future.

1222
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,170
Cybernetics is our future.

1223
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:52,710
Cybernetics is our future.
- Eric!

1224
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:53,543
Get out of my way!

1225
01:25:53,543 --> 01:25:54,980
Are you okay?
- Cybernetics is our future.

1226
01:25:56,112 --> 01:25:57,689
(electricity sizzling)
(popping)

1227
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,894
Cybernetics is our future.

1228
01:25:59,894 --> 01:26:01,336
- I think he's worse.
- Cybernetics is our future.

1229
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:02,412
- [Woman] He's a robot!

1230
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:04,949
- Looks like it.
- Cybernetics is our future.

1231
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:06,290
(relaxing music)
- With the collapse of

1232
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:08,140
Cybercore, and the withdrawal of the

1233
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,960
Computerized Judicial
System from our government,

1234
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,030
Cybercore President J. Craig
Rounds has disappeared,

1235
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:18,320
fleeing charges of treason,
conspiracy, and murder.

1236
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:21,830
I leave you tonight with this.

1237
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,850
Crime is at an all time
high, and there are no

1238
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:26,330
easy answers to the violence.

1239
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,830
But we do have something crime can't take.

1240
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,270
Something worth fighting for.

1241
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,380
And that is the dignity of the individual.

1242
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:38,510
The value of the human soul must never

1243
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:40,360
be surrendered to the powers that be.

1244
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,560
In the words of novelist Ayn Rand,

1245
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,510
I respect no obligation
towards men except one.

1246
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,620
to respect their freedom,

1247
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,900
and to take no part in a slave society.

1248
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,550
I'm Connie Griffith.

1249
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:02,820
What'd you think?

1250
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,811
- Looks like maybe you
ought to run for senator.

1251
01:27:04,811 --> 01:27:07,260
(chuckling)

1252
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,610
- So, what are you gonna do now?

1253
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,440
- Well I'm waiting to get reassigned.

1254
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,910
Guess you could say I'm a
bodyguard without a body to guard.

1255
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,160
- Hmm, I seem to know someone
who needs a bodyguard,

1256
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,360
but um, she'd definitely need to know

1257
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,690
that she's your only client.

1258
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:27,440
(relaxing music)

1259
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:44,390
Hey did you hear anything on Rounds yet?

1260
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,223
- No.

1261
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:48,180
- I don't think you will.

1262
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,080
- And why is that?

1263
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,450
- Hmm, let's just say,

1264
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:55,611
I gave him a taste of his own medicine.

1265
01:27:59,324 --> 01:28:04,324
(relaxing music)
(waves crashing)

1266
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:23,650
- I am Unit Eight, of the

1267
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,350
Federal Division of Core Trackers.

1268
01:28:26,463 --> 01:28:29,296
(dramatic music)
