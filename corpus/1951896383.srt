1
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,319
Wow! This is amazing!
I think half of Palm Beach has turned out

2
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,657
for the world premiere of <i>Spy Teen II.</i>

3
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,868
And I see the limo now with teen heartthrob
and star of <i>Spy Teen II,</i>

4
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,804
Mister Eddie Tudor!

5
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,019
Congratulations on the movie, Eddie!

6
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,615
Oh, yeah.

7
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,483
Oh, yeah.

8
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,323
<i>Hey, Palm Beach!</i>

9
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,661
Your fans are waiting for you!

10
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,564
They're going crazy!
There's thousands of them!

11
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,572
Someday, that'll be me.

12
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,572
Turn that junk off, will you?

13
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,411
Come on, hurry up. Get dressed.
You're going to be late for school.

14
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,579
Got a big day starting tomorrow, you know.
We've gotta work this weekend.

15
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,714
Did you hear that, Pop?
You said "weekend."

16
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,917
That's the time you're supposed to rest.

17
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,461
Says who? Anyway, it's the O'Leary Estate.

18
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,294
Have you seen their backyard?
Oh, it's a thing of beauty.

19
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,630
It's going to be you and me
and dirt and worms.

20
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,532
What could be better?

21
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,933
I miss you guys.

22
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,180
<i>Action, action, action!</i>

23
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,857
- Oh, yeah.
- Cut!

24
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,234
Look, first of all, it is one front flip
before you get into the car, eh?

25
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,370
And you have to look behind you
to make sure they're not following you,

26
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,573
before you peel off.

27
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,550
Listen, if somebody was chasing you,
you wouldn't look back

28
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,076
to see if they were still chasing you.
You're stupid!

29
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,488
Now, I'm going to do two front flips,
'cause I can.

30
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,223
- Gunther, did we get that?
- No.

31
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,232
No. Jean-Pierre,
how do you say director in French?

32
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,133
- He's acting like a child!
- He is a child!

33
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,365
I should have opened a café.

34
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,939
Listen, I don't care what you have to do.
Work it out.

35
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,005
We're happy in Palm Beach.
We want to stay here.

36
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,107
- How are you?
- Good.

37
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,242
- Know your lines?
- Yes.

38
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,445
- Get your stunts down?
- Yes.

39
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,044
Hey, listen up.

40
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,651
People are spreading the word
that you're creating problems on the set,

41
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,887
and there's a whole lot of cash riding
on this production.

42
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:41,366
So if you don't change your attitude,
they will replace you.

43
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,568
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

44
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,170
And another thing,

45
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,074
no more pretend fainting spells
to get out of work. You hear me?

46
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,578
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Good.

47
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,774
- I'll see you later, babe.
- Bye, Mom.

48
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,009
Hello.

49
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,983
Hey, Elizabeth, better not lose the stylist,

50
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,784
or you might end up looking fat
like in your last picture.

51
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,848
I hate you, Eddie Tudor!

52
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,560
You're getting mighty big
for your britches there, kid.

53
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,692
- What does that mean?
- It means you're acting like a little jerk.

54
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,932
You're not that cute little seven-year-old
anymore, Eddie. You better watch it.

55
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,373
You better watch it, Jerry,
before my mom finds out you're too old

56
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,606
to read my contracts and gets a new agent.

57
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,110
Whoa, nice.

58
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,216
Hey. What's up, little man?

59
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,623
Nothing much. Just reading this book
you gave me. It's awesome.

60
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,925
Yeah, that's great. Glad you like it.

61
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:22,024
Yeah, check out this part.
"Be careful in the use of mirrors.

62
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,595
"It teaches the actor to look on the outside
and not the inside of his soul."

63
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,970
- That's an important one.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,212
All right, what does it mean?

65
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,511
Well, I think what he's saying is
that acting is about real emotions,

66
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,279
not just about making faces for the camera.

67
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,913
Oh, like when Eddie Tudor
tells Lady Elizabeth

68
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,321
that she's the prettiest girl
on the pirate ship?

69
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah, like that.

70
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,820
Aye, matey,
I'll never let one of your pirates free

71
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,594
until I get my Lady Elizabeth with me.

72
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,035
Lady Elizabeth,
you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met.

73
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,908
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good show.

74
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,377
All right. Now it's your turn.

75
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,108
- No, I don't...
- Come on.

76
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,547
No, I'm not in the mood today.

77
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,517
- Come on, Miles.
- No. Come on, I'm tired.

78
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,054
- It's the morning. It's early.
- You know what? It's because you're lazy,

79
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:20,388
and that's why you just sit
on this lawn chair all day and do nothing.

80
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,189
Come on.

81
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,992
Fine. A short one.

82
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:35,905
"If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
absent thee from felicity awhile,

83
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,410
"and in this harsh world
draw thy breath in pain,

84
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,946
"to tell my story."

85
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,816
- That was great.
- Thanks.

86
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,981
It's too bad you got caught up
in cheesy movies and lost your career.

87
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,150
I didn't lose my career.

88
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,717
I walked away from it
because I became an idiot.

89
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,286
Let's go, Tom!

90
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,468
What's he got you speaking Italian for?

91
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,912
Well, it's good to know accents
for different roles.

92
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,678
Yeah, well, just remember,
we've got a busy weekend ahead of us.

93
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:25,884
Yeah. Pop, look, I'm not so sure
I want to work with you this weekend.

94
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,923
You think I'm going to give you money?
You gotta work for money.

95
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,726
I know, I know. It's just that...

96
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,995
The school has this acting club called
The Broadway Players, and...

97
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,866
- The Broadway what?
- Players.

98
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,465
They meet every weekend
and sometimes at night.

99
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,374
I was hoping that maybe I could join.

100
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,073
So you're going to join an acting group.
What about work?

101
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,050
Well, maybe I can get a job in the studio
after school and work on the sets.

102
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,021
You don't know what you're talking about,
Thomas.

103
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,148
That production in there ain't hiring locals.

104
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,217
They're a bunch of pig heads
with no respect for the working man.

105
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,525
Palm Beach is looking
to kick them out any day now.

106
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:10,467
And that's why you are going to go
to work this weekend, learn landscaping,

107
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,969
and that's that.

108
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,371
- I don't wanna learn landscaping.
- Landscaping is great work.

109
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,808
I'm not good at it!
And, frankly, I just hate dirt!

110
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:23,542
There's money in dirt. Look, Thomas...

111
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,848
Look, Pop, I'll work with you this weekend,

112
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,979
but not because I want to.

113
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,405
Hey, Tommy. Do Darth Sidious.

114
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,247
His death was a necessary loss.
Soon, I will have a new apprentice,

115
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,718
one that's younger and more powerful.

116
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,221
- Hi, Tom.
- Hey, Sandy.

117
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,087
Hey, do Eddie Tudor.

118
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,388
Oh, yeah.

119
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,986
- Hey, loser!
- Did you just call me a loser?

120
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,794
- Yeah, I did. That's my girlfriend.
- A thousand pardons, sir.

121
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,802
Talk to me in a normal voice
or I'm gonna punch you in the face.

122
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,431
Saved by the bell.
That's the luck of the Irish for you.

123
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,246
- Aye, matey, drop your sword!
- No way, man.

124
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,286
That's not what a pirate would say.
A pirate would say,

125
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,686
"I'll never drop me sword to you,
you scurvy dog!"

126
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,926
Tom Canty, I have had it with you!

127
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,863
What's the matter with you, boy?

128
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,264
Don't you have any interest
in any of your subjects?

129
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,097
Well, then what are we supposed to do
with you?

130
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,437
I can't possibly send you to detention again,
because it does no good.

131
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,871
What do you want to do with your life?

132
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,811
- I wanna be Eddie Tudor.
- Who?

133
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:08,616
You know, actor. He's in all the movies
like <i>Pirates of the Peninsula</i> and <i>Spy Teen.</i>

134
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,248
- You want to be an actor?
- Yeah, that's what I want to be.

135
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,050
In all the movies.

136
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,322
I mean,
I have books on acting and everything.

137
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,092
Then get yourself in an acting class.

138
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,762
But while you're in my school,

139
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,272
I'm gonna need you to behave
and pay attention.

140
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,539
Okay.

141
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:34,477
Listen, The Broadway Players are meeting
in the auditorium this afternoon.

142
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,947
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

143
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,244
Then go.

144
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,493
I don't even want to be an actor.
I wanna take the boat out.

145
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,330
- This was supposed to be my day off.
- What can I tell you? The schedule changed.

146
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:59,235
This stinks. I don't get any time
to breathe around this dump.

147
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,931
I don't want to hear any more about it.

148
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,565
Well, maybe if I had a dad,

149
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,008
he'd want to hang out with me,
and I could get out of it.

150
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,276
Okay, enough with the guilt trip, Eddie.
You have me. That's enough.

151
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,845
Okay, talk to me. Well, how did it go?

152
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,578
You were supposed to fix it.

153
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,351
No... Hold on.

154
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:23,486
Eddie, go in the trailer for a second, okay?
I have to work out a little problem.

155
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,688
Fine.

156
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,294
Am I hearing this?
'Cause I'm not happy. Not happy.

157
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,382
I hate my life.

158
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,798
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,638
Hey, I was just wondering,
do you guys have any jobs available?

160
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,537
- On the lot?
- Yeah.

161
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,502
- Come back on Tuesday from 9:00 to 3:00.
- For what?

162
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,207
To fill out an application.

163
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,582
Oh! Oh, oh, I don't know if I want a job,
I just want to see if there are any.

164
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,384
Well, when you figure it out,
come back on Tuesday from 9:00 to 3:00.

165
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,923
Okay, thanks.

166
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,698
Hey. Eddie Tudor.

167
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,784
I don't want your bodyguard
to beat me up or anything.

168
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,481
- I don't have a bodyguard.
- You don't?

169
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,085
- Who the heck are you?
- Tom Canty.

170
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,189
Look, what do you want from me?
An autograph?

171
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,030
Oh, no. I just wanted to stop by and say hi.

172
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:14,334
I don't have many friends,
just a whole bunch of old people and losers.

173
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,839
Yeah, I can tell.

174
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,900
Yeah. Well, it's pretty cool that you get
to act in movies all the time.

175
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,845
- Oh, you're an actor?
- Yeah.

176
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,779
What have you been in?

177
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,475
This and that...

178
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,548
Well, nothing yet, but I'm hoping to be.

179
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,786
Why?
I mean, it's not like it's fun or anything.

180
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:39,227
It's not like you can take your boat out,
or blow up old set props when you want to.

181
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:44,201
It's just, "Rehearse this and act this,
and smile here and go there."

182
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,170
- It's kind of annoying.
- Sounds great to me.

183
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,203
You have a dad?

184
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,975
No. No, my parents died.
I live with my grandpa.

185
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,316
- You?
- Nah, never knew him.

186
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,683
I don't know where he is now.

187
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,551
Oh, that's horrible.

188
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,991
- You want to see my boat?
- Sure.

189
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,686
Cool.

190
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,928
- Wow, that's so awesome! It's an Ebbtide.
- Yeah, I know.

191
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,132
Are you gonna take it out today?

192
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,269
Well, not right now, but I do know how.

193
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,110
I had to drive a boat for my last movie.
I do all my own stunts,

194
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,207
and the special effects people
taught me how.

195
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,718
They're the coolest people
to know on the set. It's great.

196
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,688
They even taught me how to hot-wire it.
Just for fun, though.

197
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,520
They made me promise not to steal a boat.

198
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,026
Still sounds cool to me.

199
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,256
Do you have an Xbox?

200
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,629
No, no.
My Pop's really strict on stuff like that.

201
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,531
Sometimes we go down
to the local coffee shop

202
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,867
and we can play some arcade games,
but nothing more than that.

203
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,908
- I have an Xbox back in my trailer.
- You do?

204
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,812
Wow. Your mom really lets you play this?

205
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,441
She has no idea what I do.

206
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:11,417
Well, she wasn't always a producer,
but now she's just busy all the time.

207
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,481
But whatever. Who cares?

208
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,494
Yeah, my grandpa just works
in people's backyards.

209
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,052
I know Miles Henlon, though.

210
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,658
Yeah, he's an actor. He used to work
on this show called <i>Palm Beach High.</i>

211
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,668
It was shot on this lot.

212
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:31,032
And he did a lot of movies in the '80s.
He met Marlon Brando once. That's his hero.

213
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,169
- Who?
- Marlon Brando,

214
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,713
the greatest actor that ever lived.

215
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,039
Oh.

216
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,378
- Whoa, is that your suit?
- Yeah.

217
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,388
Unbelievable!

218
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,450
You know, it's not as shiny close up.

219
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,794
Well, that's 'cause they spray this shiny goo
all over it before I shoot. It's cool.

220
00:18:55,667 --> 00:19:00,036
And that's where you keep your G4X laser!
Oh, man. That's awesome.

221
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,197
Yeah.

222
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,313
- You don't mind if I try it on, do you?
- No, go ahead. Whatever.

223
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,244
Sweet.

224
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,066
Oh, yeah.

225
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,372
Holy cow! You look just like me!

226
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,180
Unbelievable. Wait a minute. Take this.

227
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,217
Whoa!

228
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,827
Come in.

229
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,362
We're ready for rehearsal, Mr. Tudor.

230
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,602
Well, Eddie, I should be going.

231
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,801
Maybe we can switch it...
Hang out again sometime.

232
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,139
- Oh, wait!
- See you.

233
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,780
Well?

234
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,047
Oh, yeah?

235
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,012
I'll wait for you outside.

236
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:51,108
Hey! Hey! What are you doing here?
What are you...

237
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,347
This is Gate L.
I think we just had an intruder.

238
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,521
Thomas!

239
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,427
Oh, man. It's his grandfather.

240
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,961
What the bejeepers is going through
that crazy mind of yours?

241
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,476
You know you had me worried
half to death? You know that?

242
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,569
When you didn't come home from school,
I knew exactly where to find you.

243
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,308
Now, get in there!

244
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,612
You know, you think you want to be
an actor 'cause you think it's easy, huh?

245
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,681
Put your seat belt on.

246
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,523
Life is about hard work and sacrifice.

247
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,928
You don't get something for nothing,
Thomas. You gotta work.

248
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,296
And you work hard,
good things will happen.

249
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,597
What do I always tell you?

250
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,002
Well, what do I always tell you?

251
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,738
You know, a crazy person could have
snatched you right up off the street

252
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,471
and kidnapped you.

253
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,271
Look,

254
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,175
I try to be good to you.
I know you had it hard.

255
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,018
And, well, I haven't had to be a real parent
in a long time.

256
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,158
And the only reason I push you

257
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,289
is 'cause I love you, kid.

258
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,136
- Let's just go to work.
- Okay.

259
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,736
Okay, Eddie. You know what the scene is.

260
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:30,077
Start at one, pick up the laser,
do a little banana.

261
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,717
Eddie, you getting this?

262
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:39,587
And after you make your banana
and land on two, go camera left and deliver.

263
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,185
Got it? Good. Roll sound!

264
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,830
All right, everybody. Let's get a solid one.

265
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,300
- Rolling!
<i>- And action!</i>

266
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,404
Eddie, Eddie. Let's go.

267
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:59,968
Laser. Pick up... Banana. Two. Banana!

268
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,445
Eddie! Eddie!

269
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,108
Come on, kid, we did it 1,000 times.

270
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,487
He's not supposed to faint.

271
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,165
- What is that?
- You know what this is. Stop it.

272
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,733
I'm not touching that stuff.

273
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,042
Well, you used to think it was funny.
You used to make me laugh.

274
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,311
- Well, I can make you laugh.
- Hey, listen, let's just do the work.

275
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,547
Lay the stuff out
and then we can go home for dinner.

276
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,454
- Knock, knock.
- What?

277
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,687
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

278
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,888
- Interrupting cow.
- What?

279
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,797
- Not "what," "who." Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

280
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,095
Interrupting cow.

281
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,158
Interrupting...

282
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,935
- That's a good one. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

283
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,135
Interrupting cow.

284
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,234
Interrupting cow...

285
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,075
Are you crazy? What? Are you high?

286
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,415
No. You're funny.

287
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,148
- I'm funny?
- Yeah.

288
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,317
What's gotten into you, Tom?

289
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:27,695
Oh, no. I'm not Tom.
I'm Eddie Tudor. I'm an actor.

290
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:31,964
Tom's back at my trailer.
We switched places. It's good to meet you.

291
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,069
You know, you gotta stop this.
You're starting to scare me.

292
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,905
Well, I'm not Tom. Just look at my face.

293
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,239
We switched clothes and everything.

294
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,249
You're going to give your Pop
a heart attack.

295
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,548
No. You don't get it. You're not my Pop.

296
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,862
Fine, Tom.

297
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,461
If that's the way you feel,
then I'm heading home.

298
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,630
I don't feel much like work today.

299
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,038
No. I didn't mean it like that. It's...

300
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,468
It's just... I'm not Tom.

301
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,380
- You can't keep working him so hard.
- Oh, Jerry. Don't be so dramatic.

302
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,149
You don't think maybe
you're pushing him too hard, Harlin?

303
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,850
He's faking. You've seen him do it 100 times.

304
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,153
He's just looking for attention.

305
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,227
Maybe that's 'cause he needs it.

306
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,292
- What do you mean by that?
- You haven't even been in there to see him.

307
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,702
Look, Jerry, I'm a single mom.
I'm doing the best that I can.

308
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,206
I have been working very hard to make
a better life for that kid,

309
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,607
and you're going to throw it in my face?

310
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:50,774
Besides, he's passed out, for Christ's sake.
He wouldn't know if I was in there or not.

311
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,982
Let's go, kid. The jig is up.

312
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,055
I said let's go. We know you're faking.

313
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,557
I'm really sorry.

314
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:10,465
It all happened so fast.
I just came in here to see Eddie Tudor.

315
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,765
And then we switched clothes
and the production assistant...

316
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,397
Hold it! What are you talking about?

317
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,138
I thought you knew.

318
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,734
I'm not Eddie. My name's Tom Canty.

319
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,274
Oh, my God.

320
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,013
I've had it. We've all had it.

321
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,285
I know your little fainting spell
was a put-on.

322
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,759
- Huh?
- It was a fake.

323
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,296
I'm saying I know your faint was a fake.

324
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,162
- How can you fake a faint?
- Oh, you can fake a faint.

325
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,396
- You can't fake a faint.
- I've seen you do it all over the lot.

326
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,268
The stunt guys taught you how,
three movies ago.

327
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,968
You've got to get your priorities straight,
Eddie.

328
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,532
I'm not Eddie.

329
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:01,016
You're driving me crazy.
And I have to tell you the truth.

330
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:05,716
They're thinking of replacing you.
They think you've lost your appeal.

331
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:10,355
Losing appeal? Eddie Tudor?
Are they crazy?

332
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,521
You've got to get your act together.

333
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:16,931
Know your lines, come on time,
no mouthing off, no practical jokes,

334
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:21,405
no fainting spells,
and no telling me you're not who you are!

335
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,532
Believe me, kid,

336
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,169
you say that to one person out there,
and you are toast.

337
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,713
They'll pull the plug on this production,
your mother will lose her job,

338
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,148
and no one will work with you again.

339
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,778
Could that really happen
to someone like Eddie Tudor?

340
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,085
It's show business. You bet your butt it can.

341
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,420
Miles.

342
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,575
Phony actors.

343
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,156
- Hey.
- Hey, pal. What's going on?

344
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,784
Nothing much. Got a phone?

345
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,522
- You got someone to call?
- Yeah.

346
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,827
Why don't you go in the house
and use your own phone?

347
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,232
He's sort of mad at me.

348
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:28,866
- We haven't met. I'm Eddie Tudor.
- Now, why don't you stop that?

349
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,567
That's going to do nothing for you
but get you grounded.

350
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,009
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, so am I.

351
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,604
What is wrong with you people?
You're all crazy.

352
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,843
I mean, don't you know
who's who around here?

353
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,386
Look at me. I'm Eddie Tudor!

354
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,354
Tom, get in here!

355
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,654
Hey.

356
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,063
What's up with that kid?

357
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,042
Looking good.

358
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,788
Thomas, dinner's ready!

359
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,462
What?

360
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:11,041
- Do you have anything else to eat?
- What?

361
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:16,211
Well, it's not a veggie burger,
and I'm a vegetarian.

362
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:21,412
What do you want from me? What?
You want to go to acting classes?

363
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,786
- What loser wants to go to acting classes?
- That's what I was saying.

364
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:30,794
Yeah. Why would I want to do that?
I'm already a movie star.

365
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,557
You've got to stop this, Tom.

366
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,861
I'm not Tom. I'm Eddie Tudor.

367
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,164
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to borrow your phone

368
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,228
so I can call the studio
and have someone come and pick me up.

369
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:45,208
Tom is probably looking for me
to switch places with him again.

370
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,737
You're completely losing it.

371
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,316
Why don't you just fix yourself
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

372
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,853
There's nothing I can do with you.

373
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,822
Hopefully, you'll feel better in the morning.

374
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,670
Now, don't go anywhere.

375
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,672
I'll be back to pick you up
when they're through with you.

376
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,435
- Who?
- What?

377
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,373
- Who?
- Who what?

378
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,848
Who is going to be through with me,
after they're done doing what?

379
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,908
It's wardrobe. You're being fitted.

380
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,886
Oh, of course.

381
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:49,736
Oh, no way. That was Lady Elizabeth.
I can't believe I did that.

382
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,043
- You are a jerk, Eddie.
- I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

383
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,206
What?

384
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,483
You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen.

385
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,283
Ready, Mister Tudor?

386
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,018
I'm really sorry.

387
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,715
All right.
So you know what you gotta do, right?

388
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:39,223
You come out, you hit the mark.
"Oh, yeah." Water. Good.

389
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,348
Action!

390
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,622
Oh, yeah.

391
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,155
- Hit him again.
- Oh, yeah.

392
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,959
Give me more water!

393
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,558
Cut!

394
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,103
- All right, one more time.
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,319
That's great.

396
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,085
Let's go to lunch.

397
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,194
- Hey, where're you going?
- I'm going back to the studio.

398
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,742
What are you thinking?

399
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,682
You know he won't like you running around
down there this late.

400
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,185
Does this kid get to do anything?

401
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,456
I saw you on the posters in Tom's room.

402
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:28,227
Oh, don't start in about my career.
I don't want to hear about it.

403
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,234
And stop talking like you're somebody else.
You're freaking me out.

404
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,863
Why'd you go from starring in big movies
to just sitting on a lawn chair all day?

405
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,874
I said lay off it today.

406
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,309
- I just want to know what happened.
- I quit. That's what happened.

407
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,744
I don't blame you. Acting stinks.

408
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,043
Is your Pop getting to you?
You can't let him do that.

409
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:58,255
I left the business because I didn't like
who I was, not because I didn't like acting.

410
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,654
I was a nasty person,

411
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,132
especially to those people
who really cared about me.

412
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:10,070
And soon nobody would work with me,
so it all went away. It was all gone.

413
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,807
The people who I thought were my friends,
they were just tag-alongs.

414
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,077
The people who were really my friends,
they were long gone.

415
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,321
So I moved here, and here I stay.

416
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,692
Because I like this. I like this lawn chair.

417
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,891
It's not acting that stinks, Tom.

418
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:39,130
It's the person you become
when you don't appreciate what you have.

419
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:49,703
Look, just tell the old man
I decided to take a walk for a while.

420
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:55,017
- You can't go down there by yourself.
- I'll be fine.

421
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:59,045
Oh, come on. Come on, let's hang out.
We'll talk Stanislavsky.

422
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,750
Stanis-whatsky?

423
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,023
Look, I'm leaving.

424
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,538
Come in.

425
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:26,677
Yeah, the director wanted me to tell you
that today was a better day.

426
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:31,347
It's rare that we make it through a day
without any hassles from you.

427
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,990
He wanted you to know you did a good job.
He said keep it up.

428
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,059
- See you tomorrow? Don't be late.
- I won't.

429
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,505
Hey! What's up?

430
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,736
You'd better get dressed, kid.
You've got an appearance.

431
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,607
- An appearance?
- Yeah.

432
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,807
An interview to promote <i>Spy Teen III.</i>
You remember that one?

433
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,180
Oh, I'm exhausted.

434
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,243
Well, see, that's what happens
when you have a good day.

435
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,687
Okay, I'll get dressed right away.

436
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,192
Good, and I'll meet you in the limo
in half an hour.

437
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:19,066
Tom, are you going to Players?

438
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,603
- No.
- Why not?

439
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,800
I don't know. Why?

440
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,104
I thought you said you were going,
that's all.

441
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,910
- Oh. Well, what is it?
- You know. Acting group.

442
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,244
We're gonna rehearse some scenes

443
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,682
and decide what play
we're putting up and stuff.

444
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:39,121
- Oh. Do you get paid?
- They don't pay you. It's for fun.

445
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,251
- Sounds like a bunch of losers to me.
- Wow. That was mean.

446
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:49,031
I guess you're a jerk outside of school.
No wonder you have no friends.

447
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,694
Wait, I guess I'll go.

448
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,628
Are you running away?

449
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:59,233
- Man, all you people are crazy in this town.
- Are you running away from home?

450
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,746
Well, yeah. I guess you could say that.

451
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:07,273
Look, Tom, I know it's been tough on you
with your Pop, but you've got to go back.

452
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,683
- I'm not going back to that nuthouse.
- Don't say that. Where are you gonna go?

453
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,520
I'll go back to the set
and switch places with the real Tom.

454
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,652
Then he'll come back here,
and everything will make sense.

455
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,755
But first, I'm going to follow that pretty girl
who just called me a jerk.

456
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,768
Then I'll just follow you and make sure
that you go straight home after.

457
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,294
Fine, but just don't talk to me
in front of the ladies.

458
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,511
All right, let's go!

459
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,678
- Cool.
- Yeah, man, let's make a move.

460
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,919
Hey.

461
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,118
- Take it easy. We're all set?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,251
Cool.

463
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:03,672
Welcome to our first meeting
of The Broadway Players.

464
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,741
Now, based on many conversations I've had
with some of you,

465
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,808
I've narrowed down our first
production options to just a couple.

466
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,480
Our first production
is always Shakespearean,

467
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,925
but none of us are interested
in any of those droll tragedies

468
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:27,589
that are done over and over again
by countless amateurish companies.

469
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:31,726
So, let me tell you
what we've narrowed it down to.

470
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,067
We have <i>Comedy of Errors,</i>

471
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:42,034
as well as <i>Much Ado About Nothing.</i>

472
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:49,243
What we're gonna do tonight is
we are going to vote.

473
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,289
So, I've got some ballots.

474
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:56,986
And I think this will be quite fair.
Here we are. There you go.

475
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,921
- What's she even talking about?
- Shakespeare.

476
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,361
Shakespeare?

477
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,071
Hey. Where are you going now?

478
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,804
Well, I ain't hanging out with those losers.

479
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,110
- They seemed pretty cool to me.
- Well, it isn't. It's stupid.

480
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:24,553
And who cares about Shakespeare, anyway?
The guy's been dead for, like, 2,000 years.

481
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,649
Come on, don't be intimidated.
You can always learn.

482
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,753
- That's what school's for, right?
- Look, lay off, man.

483
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,822
I mean, why do you even care what I do,
anyway?

484
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,893
I've known you since you were a little kid,
Tom. You're my buddy.

485
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,768
I'm going and don't follow me, okay?

486
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,109
Okay, you can stop following me now.

487
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,552
Tom is in the trailer waiting for me
to come back and switch places.

488
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:02,558
Then I'll be a movie star again,
and he can go back to planting trees.

489
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,356
Watch. You'll see.

490
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,255
Hey, I'm Eddie Tudor.
I need to get to my trailer.

491
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,929
- You again? Beat it, kid.
- Excuse me?

492
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,440
I said get out of here
and stop playing around.

493
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,499
I don't know if you know who I am,

494
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:23,308
but I need to show up on set
or you'll lose your job. How about that?

495
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,577
Well, if you were Eddie Tudor,
you'd be on a plane to Miami.

496
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,175
How about that?

497
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,585
They're not in there, Tom.

498
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,783
- I'm not talking to you.
- He's right.

499
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,225
Tom, look.

500
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:45,195
- All the trailers are gone.
- They must have moved to a different lot.

501
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,965
No. They're gone, Tom.

502
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,871
Yeah, I can see that.
I wanna know where they went.

503
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,569
- They went to Miami.
- Miami?

504
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,345
Yeah, they changed locations
to save money.

505
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,248
You'll read all about it
in the paper tomorrow.

506
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,185
It's okay.
There'll be another production in here soon.

507
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,189
Another production?

508
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,784
What were they thinking?
How could they leave without me?

509
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,922
They wouldn't go anywhere without you.

510
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,161
Now, come on. Snap out of it, will you?

511
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,567
You're right. They wouldn't.

512
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,063
Because they still think I'm there.

513
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,438
Because that little punk is pretending
to be me!

514
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,502
- Tom.
- Stop calling me Tom, you crazy psycho!

515
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,674
- Now, which way is Miami?
- Don't be ridiculous.

516
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,845
Tom!

517
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,204
Hello? Yeah. Yeah.

518
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,765
What is... What is this about?
I sent you an invoice.

519
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,834
What am I gonna do?

520
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,474
My boat. My boat!

521
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,866
What? Are you on speakerphone?
You have an echo. I hope... Yeah.

522
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,094
I can't talk to you!

523
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,161
Look, I just dropped Epsom salts
all over the bathroom floor.

524
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,609
- Wait. Where are we?
- The airport.

525
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,274
- Wait. Why?
- Your mom's waiting on the jet. Come on.

526
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,840
No, wait a second. Where are we going?

527
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,615
- Not far. Come on.
- I'm not getting on that jet.

528
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,590
Oh, you're getting on that jet
if I have to drag you on myself.

529
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,288
All right. Here we are.

530
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,798
Just sit right down here. Good boy.

531
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,771
Eddie, take your sunglasses off inside.
It's too obnoxious, even for you.

532
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,651
Take them off.

533
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,746
I'd like to keep them on.

534
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,893
- By the way, where are we going?
- We're going to Miami.

535
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,293
Wait. I thought I had an appearance
for <i>Spy Teen III.</i>

536
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:30,561
- Oh, you do. In Miami.
- Well, why didn't you tell me this?

537
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,728
Because we all know
how dramatic you are, Eddie.

538
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,198
- Excuse me!
- Okay.

539
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,605
- Can somebody open those doors?
- Okay, okay.

540
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,908
Eddie, Eddie. Eddie! Sit down. Listen.
We have to go to Miami, okay?

541
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,417
Now, why don't you just calm down
and we'll talk about it?

542
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:52,285
Look, I'm not Eddie. Do you hear me?
I'm not Eddie Tudor.

543
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,087
My name is Tom Canty!
We switched places this afternoon!

544
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,388
Okay. You know something?
This is ridiculous.

545
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,258
I'm not going to stand for this behavior.

546
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,492
I am sorry we have to relocate, okay?
It's just as simple as that.

547
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,828
Relocate?

548
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,402
Listen to me.

549
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,933
We ran into

550
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,737
a bit of a tax issue in Palm Beach.

551
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,005
So to save some money,
we have to move to Miami.

552
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,445
Listen, there's nothing I could do about it.
I know you love your boat.

553
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,574
- We'll get you another...
- My boat? Let me off of this jet!

554
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:21,709
Okay. I don't want you to overreact.

555
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,345
So let's just take a big breath
and calm ourselves down.

556
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:29,723
- Listen to me. Big breath in. Big breath out.
- I want to go home!

557
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,659
Oh, my gosh.

558
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,597
Listen, I've just about had it with you,
Eddie. All right?

559
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,003
You are going to Miami
if I have to fly this plane myself.

560
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,047
Tom!

561
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,170
- You cannot steal this boat.
- It's my boat.

562
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,837
Your Pop is gonna kill you
if you get arrested.

563
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,574
He's just starting to come around
about the acting lessons.

564
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,446
Who wants acting lessons?

565
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,385
What are you doing? Give me that key!

566
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,325
- Give me the key! Give me the key!
- You want this key?

567
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,518
Yeah.

568
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,524
- There.
- What did you do that for?

569
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:45,090
Because if you steal that boat,
you're gonna get arrested.

570
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:49,003
The whole movie is gone. It's gone, Tom.

571
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,939
If you were really a part of it,
you'd be with them.

572
00:46:56,847 --> 00:47:00,374
They left me. Mom left me.

573
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,856
Come on. Let's go home.

574
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,096
<i>Yay!</i>

575
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,436
<i>Come on, clap.</i>

576
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,604
<i>Come on, Pop. Clap for Tom.</i>

577
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,605
<i>Come on, clap.</i>

578
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,977
<i>It's showtime, kid!</i>

579
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:13,783
It's showtime, cutie pie. Wake up. Wake up.

580
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:19,326
You must have been tired.
You've been sleeping for eight hours.

581
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:24,129
- Where are we?
- Sunny Miami. You're gonna love it.

582
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:29,764
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I need to get back to Palm Beach.

583
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,741
Well, there's nothing in Palm Beach.
We took it all with us.

584
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:36,802
- Pop, Miles...
- You have a bad dream?

585
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:43,218
- You just breathe and relax. Let it go.
- No. No, you really don't get it.

586
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,986
- I have to get back to Palm Beach.
- But what is the attachment to Palm Beach?

587
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:55,055
Okay, look.
If you relax, Palm Beach is an hour away.

588
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,158
Do your work,
we'll go visit anytime you want.

589
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,898
Tonight?

590
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,202
Tonight. Fine.

591
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:09,075
You do a good day's work,
we'll go to Palm Beach.

592
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,807
Hey, is that mean lady gonna yell
at me again?

593
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,717
- You mean your mother?
- That's his mother?

594
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,728
It's just a situation
that got completely out of control.

595
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,329
It wasn't being handled properly.

596
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,601
We never should have had
to leave Palm Beach.

597
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,940
- They practically threw us out.
- Bunch of hicks.

598
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,640
- Why'd they kick you out?
- What?

599
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,945
- I said why'd they kick you out?
- Why don't you go back

600
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,475
to learning your lines
and getting water dumped on your head?

601
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,114
Don't worry about what the big producers
are doing, okay?

602
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,249
Don't talk to him like that.

603
00:49:55,325 --> 00:50:00,160
Eddie, it's just a little too complicated
for you to understand, that's all.

604
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:05,258
Oh, really? Yeah, well, what I heard is that
you guys are a bunch of stuck-up pig heads

605
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,099
with no respect for the working man.

606
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,197
You guys were gonna get kicked out
sooner than later.

607
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,742
Well, that's just what I heard.

608
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,334
- Really?
- Yeah.

609
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,840
What was that?

610
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,613
- I was telling the truth.
- Well, don't do that.

611
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,450
First team. First team. I need Eddie.

612
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,353
All right, get going.

613
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,420
And no fainting!

614
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,087
Eddie, come on.

615
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:43,105
All you have to do is stand on your spot
and say your lines to Elizabeth.

616
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,868
- Think you can handle it?
- Yeah.

617
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,501
Okay, great. Roll sound!

618
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,474
You want to shoot the rehearsal,
just in case?

619
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,572
Yeah, we better shoot everything
with this kid.

620
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,116
All right, Eddie. This is very important.

621
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,243
This is the biggest moment of the movie,
all right?

622
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,617
- Okay.
- Do your best here, buddy.

623
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,679
And action!

624
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,385
I just want to tell you
that in times of danger,

625
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,726
when the universe is in our hands

626
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,996
and the madness of everyone around us
makes no sense,

627
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,560
I'm really glad to have you as a friend

628
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,402
and as a fellow protector of goodness.

629
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,899
We will beat Evil Darkness

630
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,103
and Doctor Know-it-All
and their evil motives.

631
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,240
We will save our planet.
Innocence and goodness will prevail.

632
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,410
So once and for all, are you with me?

633
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,921
You know it.

634
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,154
And cut!

635
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,195
- Excellent!
- Eddie, that was so good.

636
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,662
- Oh, thanks.
- That wasn't like anything...

637
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,199
That was so different from everything else.
It was really good.

638
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,495
That was excellent!

639
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,662
Elizabeth, you were great.
Eddie, that was awesome.

640
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,671
We're gonna do one more for safety,
okay, buddy?

641
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:52,765
- All righty.
- All right. Settle in, everybody.

642
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,386
Come on, Mom. Pick up.

643
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:11,455
Mom. How could you do this, Mom?
Come back and get me.

644
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,430
I'm in some crazy man's house
back in Palm Beach.

645
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,724
I...

646
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,331
I don't even know where I am.

647
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,346
Tom!

648
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,917
Tom! Time to go!

649
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,469
Hey. You see Tom?

650
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,734
Tom?

651
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:02,107
Yeah, Tom. He's not in his room.
He's supposed to work today.

652
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,737
Yeah, I saw him.

653
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,010
He left a little while ago
to play baseball down at the field.

654
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,176
- Baseball?
- Yeah.

655
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,679
- Are you sure?
- That's what he said.

656
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,186
You should lay off that kid a little,
you know?

657
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,555
- What'd you say?
- I think you're a little hard on him, that's all.

658
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,228
You think I care what you think?
Fine life you're living.

659
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,338
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, well, don't say.

660
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,491
Oh, yeah.

661
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,975
Oh, no.

662
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:05,159
<i>Turn your engines off</i>
<i>and keep your hands in the air!</i>

663
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,005
Is this the way to Miami?

664
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:23,908
Good morning.

665
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,419
This is the appearance we postponed,
remember?

666
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,993
Eddie? You gonna speak to me?

667
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:42,163
You said we could go back to Palm Beach.

668
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,968
We will, okay? I promise.

669
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,566
We didn't get finished shooting
until late last night,

670
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,579
but everybody is talking about
what a great job you did.

671
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,582
So just keep your answers short and sweet.

672
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,612
- Did you get that last part?
- What part?

673
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,313
- Sweet.
- Yeah, I got it.

674
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,879
Yeah, well, your mother said to have fun
and she couldn't be here

675
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,926
because she has a production meeting
that she couldn't get out of.

676
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,961
So listen, we'll keep this fairly simple.

677
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,521
I'll ask you a couple of questions
about the movie, and you say it's great.

678
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,295
Maybe throw in a funny story,
something like that.

679
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,929
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah, sounds great.

680
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,165
Great. So let's get started.

681
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:22,075
So, here we are at the Tiki Grill
with the one, the only,

682
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,308
our favorite Spy Teen, Eddie Tudor.

683
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,751
So tell me, Eddie,
how does a good Spy Teen start his day?

684
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,617
What did you eat for breakfast
this morning?

685
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,081
A piece of gum, I think.

686
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:40,456
A piece of gum. Wow.
Kids, don't try that at home.

687
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:46,198
Tell us,
is there a lovely she-spy in your life?

688
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,660
What?

689
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,731
You know. Don't be secretive.
Do you have a girlfriend?

690
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,147
No, no. Not currently.

691
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,915
And here's the question
we are all dying to know.

692
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:09,391
Are you a briefs or boxers kind of guy?

693
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,058
You mean my underwear?

694
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,098
Yes, of course. It says a lot about a person.

695
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,158
Oh.

696
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,870
I guess whatever my Pop buys me.

697
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,873
Your pop?

698
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,410
It's widely documented
that your father is no longer in the picture.

699
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:34,143
Is this an exclusive that you are now
back in contact with your deadbeat dad?

700
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,117
This interview is over.

701
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,689
- Excuse me, sir?
- Can I help you?

702
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,926
What happened to the boat
that was docked here?

703
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,264
Oh, don't worry about it.
They caught the kid that stole it.

704
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,497
They've got him down
at the police station right now.

705
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:59,440
Who would have thought
a 14-year-old kid could hot-wire a boat?

706
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,140
Thanks.

707
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,592
- Who are you?
- What?

708
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,104
Don't play games with me.
I know you're not Eddie, I know it.

709
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,003
So you can tell me who you are,
or you can wait

710
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,634
until I call everybody else out here
and they can ask you, too.

711
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,470
So who are you?

712
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,211
Tom Canty.

713
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,851
- Where's Eddie?
- Somewhere in Palm Beach.

714
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:43,510
How?

715
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:47,411
Look, we switched places. It was a joke.

716
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,618
And he was supposed to come back
at the end of the day, but he never showed.

717
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,161
I had no idea I'd end up in Miami.

718
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,296
- Don't tell anyone.
- Don't tell?

719
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,629
Eddie!

720
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,102
Elizabeth, I need to speak to Eddie alone,
please. Thank you.

721
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,366
Sure. I was just leaving.

722
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,238
Eddie, I need to know
what's going on with you.

723
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,547
Do you think I'm a bad mother?

724
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,852
- What?
- Look, I work really hard for you, Eddie.

725
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,620
I work hard for us.

726
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:27,959
Look, I'm sorry you don't have a father.
I'm sorry you don't know who he is.

727
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:32,092
Okay, you want to know about him? Fine.
He was an actor who couldn't cut it.

728
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,966
So he left the business, and so he left us.

729
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:39,267
Okay, he left us before he knew you were
in the picture.

730
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,833
You're old enough to know that now.

731
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:47,708
And I decided not to tell him about you
because we are better off that way.

732
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,683
Someday, when you're older,
you'll understand that.

733
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,516
But those are our secrets, Eddie.

734
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,614
These are not things
that you tell people on TV.

735
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,953
I mean, what is this story that you made up

736
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,926
about your father buying you
your underwear?

737
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,261
And let me tell you something else.

738
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,356
If you ever leave me
another freaky voice message

739
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,493
saying that you're trapped
in some crazy man's house in Palm Beach,

740
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:09,538
oh, you're going to get it.
Do you understand?

741
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,972
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

742
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:16,637
You know, you are really starting
to freak me out, Eddie! Just knock it off!

743
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,745
I didn't steal it. It's my boat!

744
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,689
No dice, kid.

745
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:33,126
You better start piping up
and tell us who to call to bail you out.

746
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,824
Either that or you spend the night here.

747
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,525
Don't scare the kid.

748
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,036
You know very well he's a minor
with no previous charges.

749
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,267
- He didn't even get that far in the darn boat.
- Oh, wow.

750
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,367
You're that guy. You were on that show.
I remember you.

751
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,403
Come on, Tom.

752
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,046
I posted bail for you,
and I didn't tell your Pop, okay?

753
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,056
Come on, let's hear it.
What was that line you used to say

754
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,456
at the beginning of every show?

755
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,823
Burt Donavan, Miami Squad.

756
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:12,960
You know, I remember that show.
You were a huge star. A real mean guy, too.

757
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:18,699
I brought my kid to the set one day
because he just wanted to say hello,

758
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,869
and you treated us
like two pieces of garbage.

759
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,812
- You're beginning to see the light.
- I guess you could say that.

760
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,383
- How long have you lived down here?
- About 10 years.

761
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:35,184
Well, Palm Beach is a nice place to retire to
when your career goes in the toilet.

762
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:39,422
Oh, but maybe if you weren't such a jerk,
your career wouldn't be in the toilet.

763
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:42,464
Can we just please finish up the paperwork?

764
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:50,701
- You're the kid's legal guardian?
- No.

765
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,008
Then I can't let him go with you.

766
01:01:54,610 --> 01:02:00,014
Maybe I could make a donation
to your benevolent association or...

767
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:04,417
Oh, yeah. You probably make a lot of money
on those rerun checks, huh?

768
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:08,082
- How much of a donation?
- I don't know, about 200 bucks?

769
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,549
How about $500?

770
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,088
Fine.

771
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:20,198
- Who do I make this out to?
- The Police Athletic League.

772
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:25,202
For the kids, since you like kids so much.

773
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,608
Right, kid?

774
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,179
Here you go.

775
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,682
You have a nice day.

776
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,548
Thank you, Officers.

777
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:46,751
Don't worry, I'll pay you back.
Well, as soon as I get to Miami.

778
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:50,230
Tom, you are not going to Miami.

779
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,359
Now, look. I know you've had it hard,
losing your parents,

780
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:58,100
and having to live with your grandfather.
I know that can take a huge toll on a kid.

781
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,836
But listen to me. You've got to stop this.

782
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,571
You've got to pull yourself together

783
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,842
because I'd hate to see you end up
in some sort of hospital.

784
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,043
But you keep hot-wiring heavy machinery,
that's where they're going to send you.

785
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,642
Or juvie hall.

786
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:15,086
Now, it's just a matter of time
before your Pop finds out what you did.

787
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:19,618
- Let's just go home and deal with it, okay?
- I'm not going anywhere but Miami.

788
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,392
Look, I just spent a lot of money on you.
You're going to do what I tell you.

789
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,333
You're not my dad!

790
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:30,668
No, I'm not your dad, but I care about you.

791
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:36,645
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

792
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,646
Because you're a good kid.

793
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:42,309
And I don't want to see you get
in any more trouble than you already are.

794
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,080
Now, come on. Let's go.

795
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,246
You can't walk to Miami.

796
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,459
- Hi.
- Hi.

797
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,969
Hey, thanks for not saying anything.

798
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:06,566
- It's okay. What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

799
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,702
I tried to tell them I'm not Eddie,
and they think I'm going crazy.

800
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:14,113
And now Eddie's left behind somewhere
and who knows what kind of trouble he's in.

801
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,583
I think you did Eddie a favor.

802
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,483
- You do?
- Yeah.

803
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:22,285
- Why?
- Because he was about to get fired.

804
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,790
Everybody knew it.

805
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,092
Everybody except Eddie.

806
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,757
Now they're not saying that anymore.

807
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,092
Well, I'm not sure how much longer
I can keep this little game up.

808
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,003
Well, we have to keep it up
and pretend that everything's normal.

809
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:40,509
I mean, at least until we figure out
how to get Eddie back.

810
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:41,668
Yeah.

811
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,138
Pops is probably really sad.

812
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,877
- Why don't you call him?
- Then what?

813
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,351
- Ask him to come get you?
- Then what?

814
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,821
Eddie will really be fired
if they found out he pulled a stunt like this.

815
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,688
And on top of that...

816
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,655
What?

817
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:03,529
He's gonna be really mad! I'm dead!

818
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,237
It's not funny, milady. It's not.

819
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,237
Oh, so you like accents?

820
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,334
Well, how about...

821
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,213
I can even do New York.

822
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,584
Hey, yo, babe. You know,
you and I could go out for coffee.

823
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,556
Am I dreaming,
or are you two getting along?

824
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,850
No, I hate him.

825
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,023
Women.

826
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,461
I'm going to find that kid and knock him out.

827
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,264
And go back to my life.

828
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,999
That little punk won't be
in my shoes much longer.

829
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,234
And you can't force me to stay here, either.

830
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:50,302
I'm telling you, I'm only here
to figure out a way to sneak away again.

831
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,847
And this time, I won't get caught.

832
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,893
- Are you out of your mind?
- Oh, no.

833
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,656
You know what I just heard?

834
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,529
That some kid claiming to be a movie star
tried to steal a boat

835
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,558
out of the marina this morning,
and he looked a lot like my grandson.

836
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,504
And then some washed up actor
bailed him out.

837
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,041
- Now, I want to know what's going on.
- Hey, come on, now.

838
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,906
Go a little easy on the kid, will you?

839
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,913
You're not his family!
Don't tell me how to raise my grandson!

840
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,882
Come on. For Christ's sake.

841
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,077
Do you wanna ruin the whole family?

842
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,517
And then people are going to come...

843
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,480
- Hey, Billy. How's it going?
- Oh, not bad. Knock them dead today.

844
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,617
Absolutely.

845
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:38,682
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi.

846
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:39,819
- Good work, Eddie.
- How you doing?

847
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,863
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, Billy.

848
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,399
- Great job yesterday, Eddie.
- Thank you.

849
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,367
- You were great, too, Elizabeth.
- Yeah, thanks.

850
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,232
Now, listen,
you know your scenes for today, right?

851
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:52,673
- Hey, Nick.
- Yes, Jerry. What can I do for you?

852
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,571
I just wanted to tell you
before somebody else did.

853
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,111
There was a little problem in Palm Beach
with Eddie's speedboat.

854
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,170
Some kid claiming to be Eddie
tried to steal it.

855
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,842
It's all taken care of.
They arrested the kid, the boat is safe,

856
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:06,445
and it's on its way here just like Harlin
requested. So it should be a smooth day.

857
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,547
Okay, good, 'cause you know
the producers are here today, right?

858
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:09,613
I know.

859
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:13,093
What happened to Eddie?
I mean the kid who stole my boat.

860
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,824
I don't know.
Some old movie star bailed him out.

861
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,696
It's a bizarre town.
I'm so glad we're out of there.

862
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:22,260
- And you are, too, aren't you, Eddie?
- Yeah, sure.

863
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:26,772
Listen, darling,
your boat's gonna be here any second, now.

864
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,676
This is a big day, today.
We don't want to mess it up, do we?

865
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,878
- No.
- Good.

866
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,917
- Listen, I've got to talk to you.
- All right.

867
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:38,721
Now, look, just listen to me.
You will work with me when I say.

868
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,689
Now, look, just listen to me.
You will work with me when I say.

869
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,417
Here's your $20 you earned.

870
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:45,892
You will pay Miles back.
You will not join that acting club.

871
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,727
You will not wear that gel in your hair,
and you will not get in trouble in school.

872
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,391
Do you hear me, Tom?

873
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:55,369
Things were all right with us till a year ago.
Then what happened?

874
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,338
When are you going to get over
this acting stuff, huh?

875
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,306
What is that? A phase?

876
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,910
I don't know how to do this.
I wish your mother was here, you know?

877
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,243
All I can do is ground you.

878
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:12,151
All right, I want you to go to your room
and stay there until I tell you to come out.

879
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,848
Come on!

880
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:18,360
And what do I always say to you?
I only push you 'cause I love you, kid!

881
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,895
I only push you 'cause I love you!

882
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,157
Go to your bed!

883
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,651
Mom. It's me, Eddie.

884
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:52,523
All right, look.
I forgive you for leaving me behind,

885
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:56,895
but whoever the kid is pretending to be me
on the set, isn't me.

886
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,526
His name is Tom. That's all I know.

887
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:03,060
You have to kick him off the set
and come back to get me in Palm Beach.

888
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,540
I'm with some crazy old man named Pop.

889
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:11,939
Just... This time I'm serious. All right. Bye.

890
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,694
Where do you come off
lying to me about my grandson?

891
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,362
- I never lied to you.
- You knew he wasn't at the ball field!

892
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,270
You stay away from the kid. You hear me?
I don't trust you!

893
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,468
Look, he was gonna run away.

894
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:45,036
Now, I don't know if he's really gone crazy
or if he's just pretending,

895
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,480
but either way, he wants out.

896
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,849
And if you keep pushing him,
that's where he's going to go.

897
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,252
You hear me, you stubborn old man?

898
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,727
- Where do you think he's going?
- Miami.

899
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,289
- Miami?
- Yeah!

900
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,851
- There's no answer.
- Leave a message.

901
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,224
- No.
- Yes!

902
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,387
Fine.

903
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,665
Hi, Pop. It's Tom.

904
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:44,195
I'm really sorry, but I switched places
with Eddie Tudor, the movie star,

905
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:48,505
and now I'm in Miami on his movie set
with no way to get home.

906
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,807
Could you pick me up?

907
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:55,043
Well, I'm really sorry,
and I hope you're not upset.

908
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,313
Thanks.

909
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,947
I'm a dead kid.

910
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:05,482
Well, we don't have to keep it up
for too much longer.

911
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:10,730
- Are you gonna go back to Palm Beach?
- Yeah, I guess.

912
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:16,060
- You know, we could still e-mail.
- Yeah, that'd be cool.

913
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:21,173
You know, you're really good at this.

914
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,973
- At what?
- At being Eddie.

915
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:27,209
I mean, you're a better Eddie
than Eddie ever was.

916
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,350
Yeah, but you know what? I'm not Eddie.

917
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:34,116
And he's probably out there somewhere,
maybe even arrested.

918
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,685
Yeah, you're probably right.

919
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,954
Veggie burger, please. Thank you.

920
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:58,008
Yeah, hi. The Eddie Tudor production
that was shooting at your studio,

921
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,141
they moved down to Miami.
Do you know which studio they moved to?

922
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,988
Thank you. Thank you very much.

923
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,819
Are you sure this is where he's going?

924
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:13,351
That's where he said he was going,
no matter what I did to try and stop him.

925
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:17,195
He wants to be Eddie Tudor,
and he's going to the movie set to be him.

926
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,757
And what if he gets there and chickens out?

927
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,531
You don't know Tom very well, do you?

928
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,937
We fixed your laser,
and all your props will be ready

929
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,847
- in your trailer within the next hour.
- Oh, thank you.

930
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,779
How are you doing, my man?

931
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,312
- All right. Look, I'm not Eddie.
- Oh.

932
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,519
I think he stole his boat back to get here.

933
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:50,258
And he might be arrested,
he might be in some crazy man's basement,

934
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:54,894
or he might be with Miles. Hey, I don't know.
All I know is that I am not him.

935
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,133
You were doing so good.
What the heck happened?

936
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,906
You said I could go back to Palm Beach.
I want to go now. I'm not Eddie.

937
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,640
You know what? Today is not the day.

938
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,739
And, quite frankly, I don't care who you are.

939
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,944
Just act like a professional,
do your job, finish the day,

940
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,147
and then maybe I'll think
about taking you to Palm Beach.

941
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,522
- You said that yesterday, you liar!
- First team!

942
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:23,060
Look, they all love you today.
Just give them what they want.

943
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,963
Maybe you'll still have a career.

944
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,557
- What the... Eddie!
- Can we get Eddie on set, please?

945
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,899
- Take him away.
- Eddie, what the heck is this message?

946
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,563
I don't know. I gotta go on set.

947
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,233
- I'll talk to you later.
- No, Eddie, wait!

948
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,183
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Yeah, hi.

949
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,744
- We want to go to a movie set.
- Which one?

950
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,757
Actually, we're extras
on the Eddie Tudor project.

951
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,453
They didn't tell us
where we're supposed to report.

952
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,019
<i>- Spy Teen III?</i>
- That's it.

953
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,361
Has there been a kid claiming
to be Eddie Tudor

954
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,492
trying to sneak in here, yet?

955
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,763
No, sir, not yet.

956
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,397
- Section 3, gentlemen.
- Oh, thank you.

957
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,509
Hey. I'm with those guys.

958
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,920
You must be pretending to be Eddie Tudor.

959
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,928
- Section 3.
- Thanks.

960
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:34,227
Now, Eddie, big, big scene, okay?
This is it. I don't have a lot of time.

961
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:38,569
I need you to get this in one, maybe two
for me, okay? Can you do that?

962
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,835
- Yeah, I...
- Great, buddy. Let's go! Let's get this.

963
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,171
Okay, look. I talked it over with Charles,

964
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,179
and he said if you want to do two front flips,
it's fine.

965
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,647
But the tumble has to be sped up.

966
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,775
The timing has to be right
or it won't look real, okay?

967
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,717
I will not compromise timing.

968
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,687
You have a problem with this,
you can talk to your director.

969
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,349
Honestly, I've been with you
since you were five, doing stunts.

970
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,017
What is the problem, all of a sudden?

971
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,859
Okay, okay. Relax, relax.
We've got a sequence to shoot.

972
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,922
Now, are you set on two flips?
Okay, then, it's settled.

973
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,798
Just speed up the tumble.
Can you speed up the tumble?

974
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,634
- Yeah, speed up the rumble. Got it.
- Tumble. Tumble.

975
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:13,106
He's not ready.
We have professional stuntmen to do this.

976
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:18,112
- Why you don't do that? That's crazy.
- Okay. Relax, relax.

977
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,479
Okay, remember,

978
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,884
Evil Darkness will hurl you through the air
at top speed.

979
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:30,948
You'll land into the tumble,
and at twice the timing,

980
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:35,861
catapult yourself into two front flips,
which I think is egregious, but it's fine.

981
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,331
Bounce back to your feet. Big finish.

982
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:42,335
Jump into the racecar and drive away, huh?
Should be lovely.

983
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,770
You ready for rehearsal?

984
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,829
Rehearsal's up!

985
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:49,469
I don't think, I mean...
Well, I am thinking about it, but...

986
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,671
Get out of my way!

987
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,237
- Hey!
- Stop, you punk!

988
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,249
Oh, thank God.

989
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,410
- Tom?
- Pop?

990
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,716
- Mom!
- Eddie?

991
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,222
- Julia?
- Miles.

992
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,020
Oh, my God.

993
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,286
Julia.

994
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,522
I'm Harlin now.

995
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:12,658
- Mom?
- Then who are you?

996
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,636
I tried to tell you. I'm Tom Canty.

997
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,106
You're dead!

998
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,903
Wait, wait. Come back here.

999
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,742
Hey! We've got a scene to shoot.

1000
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,630
- You took my identity.
- They switched locations.

1001
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,534
I got kidnapped by your creepy grandpa.

1002
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:25,368
And I got yelled at by your mom a lot.

1003
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,670
Oh, my God. Eddie!

1004
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:36,614
Eddie! Come here. Eddie! Eddie!
I mean, Eddie. Eddie!

1005
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,414
- I mean... Eddie.
- Mom.

1006
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,154
I didn't know that that wasn't you.

1007
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,216
- That's horrible!
- I know.

1008
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,387
I am so sorry.

1009
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:53,398
- I am so sorry. I am...
- Okay, listen.

1010
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:56,335
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

1011
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:00,307
I know you push me hard
because you love me.

1012
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:06,302
Yes, baby. It's because I love you.

1013
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,383
Because I love you.

1014
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:30,303
- I missed you, Jerry.
- Oh, I missed you, too, Eddie.

1015
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:37,008
Tom? Wait a minute. Are you Tom?

1016
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,274
Yeah, Pop. It's me.

1017
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:42,043
- Why isn't that you?
- It's a long story.

1018
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:47,614
- I don't get it.
- I'll tell you everything later.

1019
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:52,386
- Hey, Miles.
- Hey, Tom.

1020
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:55,895
- You really did it this time, huh?
- I know.

1021
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,901
- I love you, kid. I love you.
- I'm proud of you, buddy.

1022
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:07,169
So you're... You're Eddie, he's not.

1023
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:12,412
Look, I just need someone
to shoot this scene. So let's get on with it.

1024
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:16,175
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay. Go get them, tiger!

1025
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,878
Go get them, baby.

1026
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,350
Harlin.

1027
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,691
Now, that's what I call a family.

1028
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:02,093
- I had no idea you had a son, Julia.
- My name's Harlin.

1029
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,023
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is...

1030
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:07,860
not.

1031
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,439
You know, when I...

1032
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:16,699
When I left town, I didn't...

1033
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:19,144
- I didn't...
- Miles, don't.

1034
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:22,581
- Really, I'm not looking for an explanation.
- No.

1035
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,245
It was because of me.

1036
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,084
Because I was no good for either of us.

1037
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:37,489
Eddie's a great kid. Talented, too.

1038
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:41,434
I got to know him a little bit
when I thought he was Tom.

1039
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:47,706
Yeah, he's really dramatic.
Guess he gets that from me, huh?

1040
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:50,839
Yeah, those crazy kids. He's your son.

1041
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,348
- What?
- What?

1042
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,214
Yeah.

1043
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:07,185
I didn't tell you because I just figured
you really wouldn't care.

1044
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,093
I mean, you left, so...

1045
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:13,032
Well, that might have been
valuable information for me to have.

1046
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,098
I might have stayed.

1047
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:18,731
Yeah, well, now you know.

1048
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:24,469
I owe you a big apology,
you little actor, you.

1049
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,811
- I tried to tell you.
- You really did.

1050
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,215
He really did try to tell me.

1051
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:34,551
But now at least I know why you were
so anxious to get back to Palm Beach.

1052
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:37,786
So listen, I've been thinking.

1053
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:41,625
- You are a real natural.
- Oh, thanks.

1054
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:44,164
The kid's got talent. Did you know that?

1055
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:45,626
And I've been thinking.

1056
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,168
This production company's gonna do
a remake of <i>Prince and the Pauper,</i>

1057
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:51,672
Mark Twain's,
and they were going to use a set of twins,

1058
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:57,007
but I don't know about you, but I think
Tom and Eddie would be fantastic.

1059
01:21:57,078 --> 01:22:00,047
And let's face it, they fooled us.

1060
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:03,176
Yeah, I guess they did.

1061
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:09,115
So you want to do something like that?
I mean, act in a real film?

1062
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,318
Hey, I'm good at it.

1063
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,385
You could be good at anything, Thomas.

1064
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:19,764
I want to know if it's what you want to do,
you know? And even if it's hard.

1065
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:20,960
Yeah.

1066
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:27,106
- No more landscaping?
- No more landscaping.

1067
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,641
I want to be in the movies.

1068
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,680
Okay. Then...

1069
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,440
Let's do it.

1070
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:41,615
- Oh, thank you, Pop! Thank you so much!
- You bet, kid. You bet.

1071
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,318
- Thank you, Jerry.
- Oh, Tom.

1072
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,734
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

1073
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,033
I'm actually glad to be back.

1074
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,841
Sorry I took your car.

1075
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,038
Sorry I didn't believe you.

1076
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:07,412
Don't worry. I will pay you back
for the bail and that stuff.

1077
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,242
You don't worry about that. Really.

1078
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:20,991
Oh, you know, you're a lot younger
than I was when I first started doing this.

1079
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:26,000
You know what the hardest lesson
I ever learned was?

1080
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:27,898
What?

1081
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:31,405
Be gracious. Treat people with respect.

1082
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,597
Do you do that?

1083
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,466
I will now.

1084
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,779
That's good.

1085
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,451
That's good.

1086
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,920
Thou lookest tired and hungry.
What is thy name?

1087
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,795
Tom Canty, and it pleases thee, sir.

1088
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,893
- Where dost live?
- Offal Court.

1089
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,267
Come with me.

1090
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,600
And cut!

1091
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:08,267
That was great, guys.

1092
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:11,779
- That's a print.
- Beautiful, beautiful guys.

1093
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:16,874
So the apple doesn't fall too far
from the tree, does it?

1094
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,578
No, I guess not.

1095
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,884
- That was a great job, Tom.
- Thanks.

1096
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:24,788
Yeah, you too, pig head.

1097
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:27,828
Thanks for noticing, snot nose.
Just kidding.

1098
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,234
Okay. Who wants what?

1099
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,303
- All right. I'll see you later.
- I want a hamburger.

1100
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,813
I'll take a veggie dog.

1101
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,645
One hamburger, one veggie dog.
Coming up.

1102
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:26,050
- A what?
- A veggie dog.

1103
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:29,352
A veggie dog? What's a veggie dog?

1104
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:32,257
You know,
a hot dog made out of vegetables.

1105
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,954
You're weird.

1106
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:39,557
- L.A. Is pretty nice, huh?
- Yeah, it's really hot.

1107
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:43,695
- And it's not humid like it is out in Florida.
- Get used to it.

1108
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:45,636
I do miss my lawn chair.

1109
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,174
- I bet you do.
- Sometimes.

1110
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,767
- So what do you guys want to do today?
- You got a football?

1111
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,506
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's play some football.

1112
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:55,642
Hike!

1113
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:12,094
All right, show me what you got.

1114
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:15,499
You will love this.
It's simple and beautiful, okay?

1115
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,232
First, the right.

1116
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,207
He comes back, and then <i>gauche.</i>

1117
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,470
And now, pièce de résistance.

1118
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,311
I don't know. Give me some...
Jazz it up a little bit.

1119
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:31,283
Jazz, jazz. What is this? Dance?
How about this?

1120
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:35,220
No, no, I don't know. Weak.
It's weak. Hit him again.

1121
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:37,882
What about that?

1122
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:39,085
- No.
- No.

1123
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,957
You're not hitting him hard enough. Hit him!

1124
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:44,657
Show me something!
It's nothing. It's nothing!

1125
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:46,495
What if he's not Hubert?

1126
01:31:53,532 --> 01:31:55,195
THE END
