2
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:09,079
Crocodiles hail from the great age of
reptiles over 70 million years ago.

3
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:14,238
Since then, the world
has changed dramatically...

4
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,558
but amazingly,
they have changed little.

5
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,516
They're the only
great reptile predator...

6
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:26,996
to have outlived the dinosaurs.

7
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:35,244
Ancient they may be
but 70 million years on...

8
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,717
they're still the most successful
freshwater predator.

9
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:41,401
Most of the waterways in
the tropics these days...

10
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,001
have their own species
of crocodile.

11
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:47,523
How come they've been
so successful for so long?

12
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:52,044
It seems their design when it first
appeared was already very advanced...

13
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:55,199
and it's kept them
successful ever since.

14
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,803
This film reveals the
nature of that success.

15
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:13,399
Crocodiles may have scored
an early evolutionary bull's eye...

16
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,799
but there's much more to their
staying power than brute strength.

17
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:37,158
Only now, by exploring
their complete world...

18
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:40,717
above and below water,
by day and night...

19
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:44,800
can we fully appreciate
just how sophisticated they are.

20
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:13,116
Underwater, crocodiles
have perfect poise.

21
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:16,802
They can control their
buoyancy like a submarine.

22
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:23,402
To dive, they breathe out
which reduces their lung volume.

23
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,922
They can sink without trace.

24
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:41,483
While submerged a protective
membrane closes over their eyes...

25
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,239
like swimming goggles.

26
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,921
Crocodiles are cold-blooded.

27
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:51,916
They rely on the temperature
of sun and water...

28
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,124
to heat themselves up
or to cool down.

29
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,085
But when fully charged...

30
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,206
they are capable of
breath-taking power and speed.

31
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:21,359
They're the most dangerous
freshwater predator on the planet.

32
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,039
Even Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't
match this winning formula.

33
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:41,082
It's a design that has allowed them
to spread around the tropical world.

34
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:46,765
This extended family includes
alligators of temperate waterways...

35
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:51,518
Gharials of the Indian
subcontinent...

36
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,079
and caiman of tropical
South America.

37
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:03,726
They've even invaded the sea.

38
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:13,196
Crocodiles have special glands which
enable them to tolerate saltwater.

39
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,640
This is how they've colonised
new rivers along the coast.

40
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:31,602
But only a few species
can migrate across oceans.

41
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,998
The real specialists,
the saltwater crocodiles...

42
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,681
are affectionately known
as "salties".

43
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,839
They've been seen
1000 kilometres from land...

44
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,478
encrusted with barnacles, as they
search for new island homes.

45
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:51,840
This pioneering spirit and
their unique character...

46
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:54,965
has made them a universal threat.

47
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,439
Crocodiles deserve their
tough reputation...

48
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,280
but they aren't just
solitary killers.

49
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:26,680
In the calm of the Florida swamps we
can begin to see them in a new light.

50
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,559
They are reptiles
with social skills...

51
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,878
and American alligators
are particularly chatty.

52
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:44,526
During the breeding season...

53
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,282
an expressive chorus of
bellows, grunts and hisses...

54
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:52,156
rises from their densely
vegetated swamps.

55
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:01,639
The males are calling
to distant females...

56
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:05,117
but their bellows
sometimes attract rivals.

57
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:17,319
There are snappy ways to
make your feelings known...

58
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,921
if you end up
in the wrong company.

59
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:26,959
The resident male only shows
a bit of muscle...

60
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,766
if the rival fails to
get the message.

61
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:51,358
He's made his point and he can
now focus on finding a mate.

62
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,396
Vibrations within
his muscle walls...

63
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:04,923
send sound waves
rippling out in to the swamp...

64
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:08,397
powerful enough to
make the water dance.

65
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:37,479
Part of his roar radiates
at such low frequency...

66
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,002
that human ears can't hear it.

67
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:44,285
But these subsonic calls
have astounding penetration...

68
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:48,884
travelling four times faster
and further under the water.

69
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:53,444
Only with special low frequency
recordings...

70
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:57,122
can we appreciate what
the female alligator hears.

71
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:12,085
She finds his romantic
rumblings irresistible.

72
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:58,355
Even though the call may come from
the remotest parts of the swamp...

73
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,757
she is soon on his wave length.

74
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:04,119
Then they have a more
intimate conversation...

75
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,562
conducted in body language.

76
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:31,925
Their relationship is sealed,
touchingly.

77
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:53,842
Crocodiles are extremely
sensitive to touch.

78
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:58,444
Their armour-plated toughness
would appear to be only skin-deep.

79
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:08,315
Such complicated language
and behaviour...

80
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:11,445
is exceptional among
today's reptiles...

81
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:14,883
but crocodiles might provide
a tantalising rear window...

82
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:19,723
on the social life of their
ancient relatives, the dinosaurs.

83
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,000
Nile Crocodiles are the most
fraternal crocs of all.

84
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,118
Once a year,
they hang out together...

85
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,677
soaking up the sun
at traditional mating places.

86
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,083
These are far from being
lazy afternoons.

87
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,965
The group is very organised...

88
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:44,245
so individuals keep a careful eye
on movements within it.

89
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:50,326
An adult male, over five metres long,
is the centre of attention.

90
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:05,560
Up to ten females spend much of their
time in the water soliciting him.

91
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:09,197
They bear their throats
as a gesture of appeasement.

92
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:17,526
Body signals are also
used by the male.

93
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:21,839
He shows-off with noisy
water displays.

94
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:40,803
These postures enhance
his attractiveness to females.

95
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,436
It is they who often
take the lead...

96
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,282
by rubbing themselves
along the length of his body.

97
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,799
At first he snubs both of them.

98
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:18,916
But the rubbing releases a pungent
oil from glands under their jaws.

99
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:24,080
Both sexes are highly sensitive
to this crocodile perfume...

100
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:28,365
and the male answers
with his own musky message.

101
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:41,637
The scent in the water is
particularly potent prior to mating.

102
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:18,683
Several weeks later, the females
are ready to make their nests.

103
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:23,600
Even when basking, adults
rarely move far from the water.

104
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:28,318
It's ironic that the first
critical part of crocodilian life...

105
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,523
is spent on land.

106
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:39,436
Crocodile babies are born encased in
eggs but they must still breathe air.

107
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:44,556
It's essential this mother lays her
clutch beyond the high water mark.

108
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:58,123
The eggs will be so at risk...

109
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:02,326
from drowning, predators and
temperature fluctuations...

110
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:07,197
that she relies on exactly the
same nest position year after year.

111
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:12,244
These time-honoured sites are a
measure of the experienced care...

112
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,637
that crocodile mothers provide.

113
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:25,799
Once the excavation is complete she
lays her eggs in a trance-like state.

114
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,801
She's entering a deep
commitment to her offspring.

115
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,919
The hole will become
an incubator.

116
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,884
Crocodile eggs will only develop...

117
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:55,916
if they remain between a
steamy 27 and 34 degrees...

118
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,641
so her choice of site is critical.

119
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:14,436
Nest chambers from equatorial African
plains to Himalayan river valleys...

120
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,326
all remain within
this temperature range...

121
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:21,480
but no-one knows how
crocodile mothers get it right.

122
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:36,036
Once the nest is sealed,
the mothers keep vigil for 90 days.

123
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:48,924
Temperature determines
the sex of the developing eggs.

124
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,159
A half degree difference between
the top and bottom of the nest...

125
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:56,320
can markedly affect
the ratio of males to females.

126
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:59,638
Given the changes in climate
that the world has experienced...

127
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:03,686
it seems incredible that crocodiles
have survived at all.

128
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,602
Overall, enough males
and females emerge...

129
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:28,046
but these baby Nile crocs face more
immediate threats to existence.

130
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:32,519
Raiders might be drawn to
their combined noise and smell.

131
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:38,282
Hopefully their mother will hear
their calls and reach the nest first.

132
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,046
Once she digs them out...

133
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:13,156
they must reach the relative security
of water as quickly as possible.

134
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,521
The babies could probably
find their own way...

135
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,759
but they are only safe
if they stick together.

136
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:31,682
So their mother transports them
to water herself. In her mouth.

137
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:47,326
The skin of her lower jaw stretches
into a hanging cradle...

138
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:50,843
in which she can carry
fifteen or so at a time.

139
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:56,437
It's a snug fit, once you're in.

140
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,327
Her forty-or-so eggs
hatch simultaneously...

141
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:08,206
so she'll have to make
several trips.

142
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,442
The clamourings of
the hatchlings...

143
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:30,202
constantly remind her
to return to the nest...

144
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:42,280
and ensure that no-one
misses the last bus.

145
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:05,920
She releases them into
a nursery pool.

146
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,124
They must make the most
of her tender loving care.

147
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:13,121
They have only a few weeks
under her watchful eye.

148
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:23,361
For safety's sake, they call
to each other and to her...

149
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:26,997
conversations which
continue into adulthood.

150
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,681
The 18 different sounds
they'll use...

151
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:34,762
represent a vocabulary more typical
of mammals than of reptiles.

152
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:42,360
Unlike mammals, their rate of growth
is affected by temperature.

153
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:46,839
The warmer it is, the quicker
the food digests into body bulk.

154
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,636
Over a lifetime
under a tropical sun...

155
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:53,800
they may grow 4000 times
bigger than this.

156
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,043
Their mother won't eat at all.

157
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:08,041
She's protecting her infants
from being eaten...

158
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,084
even by other crocodiles.

159
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,325
The mother successfully
defends her own brood...

160
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:56,038
but it's a grim reminder that
crocodiles eat just about anything.

161
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:01,205
Her babies will learn that
successful crocodiles...

162
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,562
take all their dietary chances.

163
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:08,317
Their hunting technique
is there from birth.

164
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:11,604
With eyes, ears, and nose
at water level...

165
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:15,760
they mirror the tactics
they'll use as adults.

166
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,436
These shoreline snacks...

167
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:03,077
may be wildebeest or
zebra in years to come.

168
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:34,955
They rely on communal living
to survive this tender age...

169
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,199
but competition between
the youngsters is intense.

170
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:43,077
Despite their mother's protection,
only two percent will survive.

171
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:58,117
The babies of caiman, a type
of South American crocodile...

172
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:00,721
face even shorter odds.

173
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,923
Wildlife may seem abundant
in their Venezuelan marsh...

174
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:10,046
but that's because the water
elsewhere is drying up.

175
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,236
Even the fish are out of water.

176
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:21,926
The dry season is
five months long...

177
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,999
but in some years
it's more severe than usual.

178
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:30,195
Unexpectedly, animals can
be left high, if not exactly dry.

179
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:50,115
Eventually some of these watercourses
will dry up completely...

180
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:53,836
leaving many caiman
exposed and dehydrated.

181
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:03,486
Temporary skin relief is provided
by this ultimate of face packs.

182
00:25:03,647 --> 00:25:06,764
Mud is an effective
crocodilian sun screen.

183
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:15,687
Cooling water is at a premium.

184
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,123
The remaining pools
are becoming overcrowded.

185
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:26,000
At such pressing times the
adults usually rub along.

186
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,158
However, babies could
be eaten by them...

187
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,922
so this is no place for
a mother to raise her young.

188
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,757
Fortunately they can expect
complete maternal attention...

189
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,725
during this five month
period of danger.

190
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:58,004
The shrinking watercourse becomes
hazardous for the babies.

191
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,601
Drastic measures are called for.

192
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:12,036
Night-time cameras reveal
they'll make a run for it...

193
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:14,084
under the cover of dark.

194
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:23,885
Their escape will be risky,
for it is made over land.

195
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,120
Mother leads the way.

196
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:41,679
It's a while before the babies
have the courage to join her.

197
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:06,997
Calls of reassurance and
maybe her musky smell...

198
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,125
encourage the hatchlings
out of the water.

199
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:37,163
She follows good instincts.

200
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:41,725
Night-time temperatures are safer
for tiny cold-blooded bodies...

201
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,957
and there are fewer threats about.

202
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:49,281
But this is a long march that
must be concluded by daybreak.

203
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:24,396
Their mother's acute
sense of smell...

204
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,127
brings them to their watery
destination...

205
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:30,006
with less than an hour to spare.

206
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:48,161
There's plenty of water
for her babies...

207
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,966
to survive the rest
of the dry season.

208
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:06,003
But lots of other females
have had the same idea...

209
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,840
and there's only room
for one adult.

210
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:14,482
The mothers must fight, or as is more
often the case, simply leave.

211
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:20,681
Their offspring are
far from abandoned.

212
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:23,805
The remaining female will
adopt and protect them all...

213
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,162
over one hundred of them.

214
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:40,326
This super-mum
carries her burden lightly.

215
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:47,686
Family life may be unconventional but
crocodiles do grow up in company.

216
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:52,483
As hunting adults, this may prepare
them for dedicated teamwork.

217
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:05,317
Especially if there's
a rare dish on the menu.

218
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:13,637
Migrating zebra cross
the Mara River in Kenya...

219
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:16,799
on only a few occasions
each year.

220
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:23,721
Resident Nile Crocodiles can't afford
to miss these fleeting chances.

221
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,718
So they co-operate.

222
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,797
From different places
under the banks...

223
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:33,006
they spend days waiting
and watching the nervous herds.

224
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:08,560
Only when the zebra commit
themselves to a departure point...

225
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:12,402
do the crocodiles take up
their final positions.

226
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,439
The current drags the
zebra downstream...

227
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:30,397
so five or six crocodiles cover
the crossing from different angles.

228
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,606
It's hard work for crocodiles too,
but they can submerge...

229
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:44,318
taking advantage of deeper,
slower currents, to move closer.

230
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:00,326
Their approach is stealthy,
measured and tactical...

231
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:03,559
as if moving in
on a chosen victim.

232
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,885
The current is flowing
in the zebra's favour.

233
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:46,643
It buffets the crocodiles out of
position and they can't get a grip.

234
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:02,085
The zebra's wide rump
gives it a big advantage.

235
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:43,840
Adult zebras also have a vicious kick
which could break a crocodile's jaw.

236
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:48,559
That might mean starvation,
so crocodiles are also taking risks.

237
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:11,605
A lot of effort results in
little success for the crocodiles.

238
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:16,636
But only until smaller, more
vulnerable animals enter the water.

239
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:24,759
At any time the zebras can be
ambushed by frightening power...

240
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:33,484
and lightening speed.

241
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:42,402
The baby zebra faces
several waves of attack.

242
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:07,320
This is the advantage of teamwork.

243
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:24,721
Most of the year, life along Africa's
rivers is even more of a struggle.

244
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:35,477
The dry season in Zambia's
Luangwa Valley can be unsparing.

245
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:55,126
Even vegetarians
are forced to scavenge.

246
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:16,036
But crocodiles still thrive
on the edge.

247
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:32,084
Far from being dependent on large
mammals like wildebeest or zebra...

248
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:36,001
crocodiles have extraordinarily
adaptable diets.

249
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,198
We've not known this until now...

250
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:41,484
because we've never seen
them hunting at night.

251
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:49,844
What crocodiles do at night
has remained a mystery...

252
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,886
because they will only move
around naturally in total darkness.

253
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:57,642
So only with the use of
invisible infrared light...

254
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:01,197
can we see their nocturnal habits
for the first time.

255
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:06,683
In the Luangwa River shallows...

256
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:12,001
a Nile crocodile hunts for less
glamorous prey. It's stalking fish.

257
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:46,325
Over the year, crocodiles fatten-up
on fish and molluscs...

258
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:48,205
rather than mammals.

259
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,803
Mammals come and go,
but the muddy river bottom...

260
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:03,404
is always a good place
to stir up snails, for instance.

261
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:17,083
The crocodile is a flexible feeder
in its methods too.

262
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:19,397
It uses its armour plated body...

263
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:24,721
as sinuously as a length of fishing
net to corral fish towards the shore.

264
00:38:57,247 --> 00:39:01,320
Within their element, crocodiles
equally deserve the title:

265
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:03,205
"King of the beasts".

266
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:23,845
Only when the dry season
becomes desperate...

267
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:27,044
are these two great hunters
of land and water...

268
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:29,357
likely to come face to face.

269
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:47,844
But only the crocodile is bold enough
to leave the safety of water...

270
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:50,965
and meet the lion
on its home ground.

271
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,164
Few animals would actively
take on a whole pride.

272
00:41:16,887 --> 00:41:20,163
The lions are simply frustrated.

273
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,437
Especially when the smell
of their supper...

274
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:29,883
coaxes other crocodiles
out of the water.

275
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:11,275
Crocodiles have thick skins.

276
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:16,362
The lions are forced to defend their
meal by moving to a different table.

277
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:22,924
They just leave nothing
but scraps behind.

278
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:48,079
The reptiles have stronger
stomachs than the mammals.

279
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:51,159
Lions can only cope
with the chewy parts.

280
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:53,966
Crocodile digestive juices
are so acidic...

281
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:59,201
that they can break down skin, bone
and horn, to be turned into muscle.

282
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:08,482
There's no such thing
as crocodile left-overs.

283
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,278
Their exceptional sense of smell...

284
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:21,201
enables them to capitalise quickly
on the demise of others.

285
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:26,122
And at the end of the dry season
the smell of death is everywhere.

286
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:35,443
A mother hippo mourns her baby.

287
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:40,963
Crocodiles have good reason
to be wary of adult hippos...

288
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:44,278
so they wait for the
grieving mother to go.

289
00:43:57,687 --> 00:44:00,963
Food, any food,
is hard to find.

290
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:07,205
Crocodiles from up to 7 km away
recognise the whiff of opportunity.

291
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:26,122
One dead hippo attracts
over 100 hungry crocodiles.

292
00:44:26,607 --> 00:44:31,761
But there's no feeding frenzy.
This is crocodile queuing.

293
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:46,240
The reason for this
patient approach?

294
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:50,480
Crocodiles have a powerful grip
and sharp teeth...

295
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:54,686
but their jaws don't move sideways.
They can't chew.

296
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:59,839
So they have to eat large
animals together.

297
00:45:00,007 --> 00:45:04,046
One or two crocodiles effectively
brace the carcass in their jaws...

298
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:07,324
while others wrench off
smaller pieces of flesh...

299
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:10,001
by spinning their bodies round.

300
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,882
Everyone waits their turn.

301
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:43,042
With such tolerant
table manners...

302
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:47,997
it might take 24 hours to satisfy
the whole queue of diners.

303
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:51,601
Too readily, perhaps, we have cast
crocodiles as ruthless predators...

304
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:55,715
when they are also well-mannered,
adaptable creatures.

305
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:01,802
And too readily we have
called them primitive...

306
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:03,798
when our own human design...

307
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:08,165
has yet to stand up to
their successful test of time.

308
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:14,396
In evolutionary terms, the crocodile
has every reason to smile.

309
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:21,270
