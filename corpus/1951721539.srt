1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
Damn it.

2
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
What's that up there?

3
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,200
It's a terrible place,
a place filled with sickness and suffering.

4
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,100
Never go there.

5
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,300
Do you hear me? Never!

6
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
- But why?
- Because that's where she died.

7
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,500
Who died?

8
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Me!

9
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Miss.

10
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,600
Miss.

11
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,100
What is your name?

12
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Heather. Heather Reed.

13
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,900
Miss Reed, today's the first day of my class.

14
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,400
And if I bore you already, you should
probably find another university to attend.

15
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,700
However, if you'd like to join the rest of us
and possibly learn something...

16
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,700
I highly suggest
you sleep on your own time.

17
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
As I was saying...

18
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,100
White Death claimed more than 60,000 lives
in this county alone.

19
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Or, as some like to refer to it,
as the romantic disease.

20
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,100
It took you
when you were young and beautiful.

21
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,900
Remember, there will be a biology test...

22
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,600
and 10-page report due on modern medicine
and the cure for this horrific disease.

23
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,100
Have a nice weekend.

24
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,700
Miss Reed, try and get some sleep.

25
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
I don't know what's going on.

26
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
Heather, wait up.

27
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,900
Are you all right? What happened in there?

28
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,800
I don't know.
I haven't been sleeping much lately.

29
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,100
Why, you seem to be doing
a lot of it in class.

30
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm sorry. This is my friend, Tori.

31
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,800
Heather just transferred here
from Danver State.

33
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Heather. Hey, are you okay?

34
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,700
"Truth or Scare. Annual Initiation Party.

35
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
"Provocative Bedtime Attire A Must."

36
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Definitely not.

37
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, no, but you have to go.

38
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,700
It'll give you the opportunity
to meet more people.

39
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,700
And it's only the most important event
of the year.

40
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,000
Besides, I was kind of hoping
that maybe you could bring Tori.

41
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,800
She lives right by you.

42
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,300
Okay. What the hell. We'll all go.

43
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,100
Welcome to Truth or Scare...

44
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,500
<i>broadcasting live
from the scariest place on Earth.</i>

45
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,100
<i>Are we having fun yet?</i>

46
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,600
<i>Each contestant will be blindfolded and
placed on separate floors of this building.</i>

47
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>There, they will be free to remove
their blindfolds and explore the corridors.</i>

48
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,700
<i>If they dare!</i>

49
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>The rooms and corridors have been
equipped with hidden cameras...</i>

50
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,500
<i>just to make sure there is no cheating.</i>

51
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,300
<i>Everything is going according to plan.</i>

52
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,700
<i>Anybody could scare these girls.</i>

53
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,600
<i>It's a piece of fucking cake.</i>

54
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,900
<i>My rules.</i>

55
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
<i>My initiation.</i>

56
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,200
So, what brings you here?

57
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,600
My parents went here, so...

58
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,600
I think they want me to be just like them.

59
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,200
But they're important,

60
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,800
so nobody's special except them.

61
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Nice outfit.

62
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,000
Thanks. I'm Tori, this is Heather.

63
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,500
Devon.

64
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,400
Sure, I'll have another one.

65
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,100
That's okay, Heather, I'll get it.

66
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,500
Come on, girls.

67
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,000
<i>You cannot stay in one place
for more than one hour.</i>

68
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,100
<i>You must spend the entire five hours inside,
no matter what happens.</i>

69
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,500
<i>Now, at your feet you will find a key
that will allow you to remove your masks...</i>

70
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,700
<i>and face your fears.</i>

71
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
<i>Remember, five floors...</i>

72
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,900
<i>five girls...</i>

73
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,100
<i>five hours.</i>

74
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
What the fuck!

75
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
<i>I almost forgot.</i>

76
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,500
<i>Did I mention five ghosts?</i>

77
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,100
Five ghosts?

78
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,300
Fuck you, Ashley, for getting me into this.

79
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
<i>Where the fuck is she anyway?</i>

80
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Hang on. They changed our clothes.

81
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>Well, you girls have a great time. I gotta run.</i>

82
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,200
<i>Who is Elizabeth?</i>

83
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,800
Devon?

84
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,700
<i>... told me that I'm gonna be better.
That I'm cured.</i>

85
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,200
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

86
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,900
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

87
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,500
Devon?

88
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,600
Devon? Devon!

89
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Devon!

90
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Devon?

91
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Jesus, man.

92
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
Can you hold the damn light straight?

93
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm trying, man.
It's just so fucking cold in here.

94
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,800
Look, I'm going as fast as I can.

95
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,300
Now this shit's gotta work.
Not like the last time when you did it.

96
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,800
You burned
the whole fucking building down.

97
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,600
<i>You're just lucky I was there
to bail your sorry ass out.</i>

98
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
Fuck you, man.

99
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,500
Fuck you.

100
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
<i>- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!</i>

101
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,400
Is everybody having fun tonight?

102
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,700
All right, welcome to Truth or Scare.

103
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,400
This is the wildest initiation party
of the year.

104
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,100
A few of you ladies out there will be
fortunate enough to attend all our parties...

105
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
hang out at the best house on campus...

106
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,900
and some will even get to know me
a whole lot better.

107
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Ladies, please, please. I'm flattered, really.
But it's not that easy.

108
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,000
We have a special initiation process
for you this year.

109
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,900
Watch it, bitch!

110
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,000
Ashley's got real class, huh?

111
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,600
She's Miss Rich Bitch. Her family
owns about half the real estate in Kentucky.

112
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,000
Who's he?

113
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,600
That's Richie.
She acts like she owns him, too.

114
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,800
<i>Forget it, though.
He's way out of your league.</i>

115
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Okay.

116
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
You ready?

117
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
Five floors.

118
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,900
Five girls.

119
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,300
Five hours.

120
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,200
<i>You make me sick.</i>

121
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,500
<i>Now I make you sick.</i>

122
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,300
It's just a game.

123
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,000
I wanna go home!

124
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,000
I wanna go home!

125
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
<i>I wanna go home!</i>

126
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,600
<i>You are home.</i>

127
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,500
<i>I hate all of you incurable people.</i>

128
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>Ashley?</i>

129
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
<i>Liz, is that you?</i>

130
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,100
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.

131
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm scared.

132
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,500
Look, I just wanna go home.

133
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,500
Stop! Stop! Stop!

134
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
Shit. I'm never gonna get out of here.

135
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Shit!

136
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,500
<i>Oh, that's good. Five ghosts.</i>

137
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
<i>My rules.</i>

138
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,500
<i>My initiation.</i>

139
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,800
Gio, where the fuck are you, man?

140
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,900
Tell them, Don.

141
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,500
<i>Thank you, Richard.</i>

142
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,100
<i>We're live, via satellite, from hell.</i>

143
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,100
<i>Five lucky contestants will be chosen...</i>

144
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,900
<i>to spend the night
in a place of unimaginable terror.</i>

145
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,300
<i>Anybody could scare these girls.
It's a piece of fucking cake.</i>

146
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,100
Shit.

147
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,300
Where the fuck is everybody?

148
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,700
<i>Oh, Richie, you really know
how to show a girl a good time.</i>

149
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,600
"Scariest place on Earth."
Are you kidding me?

150
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,900
Where did you find this place?

151
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,600
Another one of your family's
twisted secrets?

152
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,000
What's with that skank Heather?

153
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,700
I see the way you've been looking at her.

154
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,200
<i>You know, sometimes...</i>

155
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,900
I wonder why I ever picked
a loser like you anyhow.

156
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,200
<i>You're weak, Richie.</i>

157
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,900
You walk around pretending
like you're something special.

158
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,400
But inside...

159
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,900
you're just like the rest of those...

160
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,500
incurable people.

161
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Don't you ever fucking call me that again.

162
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Face it, Richie,
you're the disease and I'm the cure.

163
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,000
And, baby, you'll never see these again.

164
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,300
<i>Ciao.</i>

165
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,700
Tori, there's something here.

166
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,200
I feel it.

167
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,900
What are you talking about?

168
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,800
There's something wrong.
There's so much pain.

169
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,900
They say this place is haunted.

170
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,300
You know, a TB hospital.

171
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,900
I heard 63,000 people died here.

172
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
It's so cold in here.

173
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,100
I'm freezing.

174
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,700
Heather, don't.

175
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,500
<i>What's that up there?</i>

176
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,800
<i>It's a terrible place,
a place filled with sickness and suffering.</i>

177
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,700
<i>Never go there.</i>

178
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,200
<i>Do you hear me? Never!</i>

179
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,500
I've been here before.

180
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,900
<i>I know you're watching me, Richie.</i>

181
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,700
<i>Still thinking of little Heather now?</i>

182
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
<i>I'm better now.</i>

183
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,100
<i>You can touch me, Mommy.</i>

184
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
<i>You can touch me now.</i>

185
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,400
What was that?

186
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,800
<i>Not what, Tori, who? Who was that?</i>

187
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
There's gotta be a way out of here.

188
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,200
I mean, someone will come and get us,
right?

189
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,600
Richie said five hours.

190
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,500
Yeah, and he also said five floors.

191
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,700
Watch out!

192
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,200
What is with you?

193
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,500
This is where she died.

194
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Who died?

195
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,300
Listen, there's a way out.

196
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,500
Do you smell that?

197
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,000
<i>Someone's making breakfast.</i>

198
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,100
<i>I don't smell anything.</i>

199
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,300
Pancakes and syrup.

200
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Oh, Annie, they're making sweet potato pie!

201
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,700
Can't you hear the train?

202
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,600
They're coming for the bodies.

203
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh, no!

204
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,000
Ashley!

205
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,500
Oh, Annie, can't you hear the train?

206
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,600
Why did you call me that?

207
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,300
Where were you just now?

208
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
Silly...

209
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,300
I was with you.

210
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,700
Who are you?

211
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,700
You're hurting me!

212
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,900
Why did they keep us together, Tori?

213
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,200
They said we'd all be on separate floors!

214
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,200
Who's on the fifth floor?

215
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,000
Come on, let's find out.

216
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,800
Tori.

217
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
Come on.

218
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Come on!

219
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
Ashley?

220
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,000
Devon!

221
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,900
Where is everybody?

222
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,200
Ashley?

223
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,200
Where are you guys?

224
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,200
Devon.

225
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,300
Guys, where are you?

226
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,600
Oh, my God.

227
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,700
Tori, please.

228
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
It's okay.

229
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,700
Tori, don't.

230
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,600
It's okay.

231
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Tori, we don't know what's in there.

232
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,800
See, Heather,
you are such a spaz sometimes.

233
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,800
Tori!

234
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,800
Heather, help me!

235
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,800
I don't wanna die.

236
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,800
Ashley!

237
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,900
Elizabeth!

238
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,400
Oh, my God.

239
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,200
Open the door!

240
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,400
You've gotta come here!

241
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,900
<i>We know everything.</i>

242
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,100
<i>How could you let them all die?</i>

243
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,800
<i>They came to you for help!</i>

244
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,800
<i>And so I helped them
by giving them a quick, easy death...</i>

245
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,300
<i>instead of the slow, agonizing decay
of disease.</i>

246
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,500
It's just a ball.

247
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,000
Devon?

248
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,000
<i>Five floors...</i>

249
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,800
<i>five girls...</i>

250
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,100
<i>five hours.</i>

251
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Tori.

252
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,800
What's happening?

253
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,400
<i>They're not infected!</i>

254
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,600
<i>Not infected.</i>

255
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,100
<i>Can't you hear the train?</i>

256
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,800
<i>I'm coming for the bodies.</i>

257
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,400
<i>Five floors...</i>

258
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,900
<i>four girls...</i>

259
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,100
<i>four hours.</i>

260
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,000
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

261
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,300
<i>Tori!</i>

262
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,600
Help me.

263
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,500
So cold.

264
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,300
<i>Nothing more than a two-bit whore.</i>

265
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,500
<i>How could you? I loved you!</i>

266
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,300
<i>You're infected.</i>

267
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,300
<i>But curable.</i>

268
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,700
<i>Your baby is crying.</i>

269
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,400
Tori!

270
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,200
<i>I was doing the community a great service.</i>

271
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,300
<i>The removal of undesirables.
Getting rid of the infected.</i>

272
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,800
<i>Your baby is crying.</i>

273
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,200
Stop!

274
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,600
<i>How could you kill your baby?</i>

275
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,800
<i>How could you kill our baby?</i>

276
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,100
Stop!

277
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,500
I'm gonna keep it.

278
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,800
R-J-V.

279
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,200
Oh, my God! That's them.

280
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,900
<i>Rock-a-bye, baby, in the treetop</i>

281
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,300
<i>When the wind blows, the cradle will rock</i>

282
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,200
<i>When the bough breaks</i>

283
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,900
<i>he cradle will fall</i>

284
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,500
<i>And down will come baby</i>

285
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,000
<i>Cradle and all</i>

286
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,500
Tori! Ashley!

287
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,700
Richie!

288
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,600
Heather!

289
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,100
Ashley!

290
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,600
Heather!

291
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,900
Heather!

292
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,900
Tori?

293
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,300
Is that you?

294
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,200
Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

295
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,900
I'm so sorry, Richard.

296
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,500
I didn't mean it.

297
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,700
I just want it to be...

298
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,600
how it used to be.

299
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,100
Help me get rid of it.

300
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,000
I just want it to be...

301
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,200
how it was.

302
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,300
Well, listen, all right,
everything is gonna be fine.

303
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,800
But we gotta go find the others,
and we need to get out of here.

304
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,000
We need to get you to a doctor...

305
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,800
No!

306
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,500
You're the one
who's always taken care of me.

307
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,300
Don't take that away as well.

308
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,800
I just want you to love me...

309
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,600
the way you used to.

310
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,800
Where are you going?
We ain't got time for this shit.

311
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,300
We got to get the...

312
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,300
Kill our baby!

313
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,000
Ashley!

314
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,000
Heather.

315
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,200
Where is everybody?

316
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,400
Oh, my God. Devon.

317
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,000
Devon, come on up.

318
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,100
I'm so sorry.

319
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,200
Oh, my God.

320
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,300
<i>Five floors...</i>

321
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,400
<i>three girls...</i>

322
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,200
<i>three hours.</i>

323
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,100
Heather.

324
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Heather?

325
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,300
No. It's not your precious Heather.

326
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,800
It's me, remember? Your fucking girlfriend!

327
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,300
What happened to you?

328
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,500
Get the fuck off of me!

329
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,700
You had your chance and you blew it!

330
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,400
Ashley!

331
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,900
<i>Ashley!</i>

332
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,300
<i>Devon's dead.</i>

333
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,100
Come on, now,
we gotta go get the other girls.

334
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,900
Okay? All right?

335
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,500
- They're dead.
- Heather?

336
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,500
What's with the ax?

337
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,900
They're all dead.

338
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,000
- What are you saying?
- They're dead.

339
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,700
What part of "dead"
don't you fucking understand?

340
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,100
And she killed them!

341
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,300
Heather, give me the ax.

342
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,800
- Give me the ax.
- Don't be a fool.

343
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,400
Give... Give me that!

344
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,000
Ashley?

345
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,300
Don't listen to her, Richie. She killed them!

346
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,100
I don't know what's going on.

347
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,500
She killed them, Richie.
She's a goddamn fucking psycho!

348
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,600
I didn't kill anyone.

349
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,900
Look, this isn't a coincidence...

350
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
why we're all here.

351
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,400
There's something that this place wants.

352
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,200
Something that it needs us to know.

353
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,500
What the fuck is that?

354
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,600
<i>My mother gave me one like this...</i>

355
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,600
when I was little.

356
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,900
Just like this.

357
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,700
It was my grandmother's,
and she was very ill with a disease.

358
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,400
If you were infected...

359
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,300
you had to wear one of these.

360
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,600
This was around Elizabeth's neck.

361
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,900
These are the initials of that place.

362
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,500
Don't you get it?

363
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,200
We're in that hospital!

364
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
This is really...

365
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,800
I know it sounds crazy.

366
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,500
We all have a link to this place!

367
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,800
We're all related to someone who was here.

368
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,600
This is fucked up.

369
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,700
Come on, Richie,
you're not buying into this shit, are you?

370
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,400
The initials stand
for Richard James Vangard.

371
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,700
I guess you could say that...

372
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,800
my grandfather was the lunatic
that used to run this place.

373
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,400
You happy? Now you know.

374
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,600
- Oh, well, bravo! My compliments!
- Ashley, come on.

375
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,900
You guys win!

376
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,800
You've both succeeded in freaking me out!

377
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,700
Ashley, stop. Leave her alone.

378
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,400
Listen, bitch.

379
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,400
You and Richie...

380
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,800
and both of your fucked up families
might belong here...

381
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,300
but Richie is mine,
and I'm not letting him go.

382
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,600
Not even over...

383
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,500
my own dead fucking body.

384
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,800
I'm out of here.

385
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,500
- Ashley, don't...
- Fuck you!

386
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,600
What the fuck is it?

387
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,500
Come on!

388
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,400
Come on. Get down.

389
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,800
Don't breathe.

390
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,300
Don't move.

391
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,100
He's going away.

392
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,500
- Where's the flashlight?
- It's right there.

393
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,000
Richie.

394
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,900
- What?
- Listen.

395
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,200
It's the records room.

396
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,400
Read that?

397
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:57,200
"Vangard Sanatorium opens to aid
widespread epidemic."

398
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,300
"White Death claims more lives!"

399
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,300
More than 60,000 lives in this county alone.

400
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,800
"Sanatorium unable to cope
with excessive death rate."

401
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,900
"Underground tunnel to be built
for use as body chute."

402
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,800
"A 500-foot tunnel...

403
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,500
"will be built to aid removal
of infected diseased patients."

404
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,300
"Vangard, madman or genius?"

405
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,800
"Dr. Richard James Vangard
was accused before a grand jury...

406
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,800
"of using an underground body chute...

01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,400

"He was also charged

"to support his lavish lifestyle."

411

You knew about this?

412
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:01,400
You knew all along,
and you still brought us here?

413
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,700
How could you do that?

414
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,100
Look, no one was supposed to get hurt.
This was just a setup.

415
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,500
We'd scare people away
from possibly attaching...

416
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,200
wrongful death suits
for their family members.

417
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,500
And as for all this shit,
this was all Ashley's idea.

418
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,400
I had nothing to do with this.
Not a goddamn thing!

419
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,000
Her family owns this place, this hospital,
everything, and it's worth millions.

420
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,800
I had nothing to do with this.

421
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,500
Ashley was in on this the whole time?

422
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,600
But why?

423
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,100
Because that sick, fucking,
piece of shit grandfather of mine...

424
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,000
had an affair with the head nurse,
Ashley's grandmother.

425
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,000
And the two of them concocted
this whole scheme.

426
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,100
There was stealing all the grant money,
all the research money, everything.

427
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,500
Lying about this fucking place
curing people.

428
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,100
They were all dying.

429
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,000
How could they do that?

430
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,000
How could you do that?

431
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,400
I don't know! I'm nothing like him!
I'm nothing like him!

432
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,000
I have nothing to do with this!

433
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,200
Man, I'm glad this scandal
ruined that sick old man!

434
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,800
One of the nurses...

435
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,100
she contracted the disease
and she hung herself, all right?

436
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,300
<i>But she didn't die.</i>

437
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,600
Her best friend came in and finished the job.

438
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,100
And the other one...

439
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,300
The other one what?

440
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,600
The other one died
from electrocution. Fuck.

441
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,300
<i>Ashley?</i>

442
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,000
Oh, my God.

443
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,700
Something in this place remembers...

444
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,800
and it's fucking pissed off.

445
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,300
We're reliving its past.

446
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,700
<i>Remember, five floors...</i>

447
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,200
<i>two girls...</i>

448
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,100
<i>two hours.</i>

449
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,000
This isn't happening to me.

450
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,100
We're not going to get out of here.

451
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:34,500
<i>I wonder why I ever picked
a loser like you anyhow.</i>

452
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,100
<i>You walk around pretending
like you're something special.</i>

453
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,400
<i>But inside...</i>

454
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,600
<i>you're just like the rest of those...</i>

455
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,800
<i>incurable people.</i>

456
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,400
"A little girl found frozen to death."

457
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,500
Elizabeth.

458
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,800
"More tragedy linked
to Vangard Sanatorium.

"She had been severely depressed

01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,200
Help me get rid of it.

01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,400
<i>This is where she died.</i>

464
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,800
Who died?

465
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,600
- Oh, God.
- Tori!

466
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,000

467
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,700

<i>Either I go where there's peace...</i>

469
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,100
<i>or else I get better.</i>

470
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,200
Enough.

471
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,200
Tori!

472
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,900
Tori!

473
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,600
Tori!

474
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,800
<i>We're live, via satellite, from hell.</i>

475
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,600
<i>I have lost everything.</i>

476
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,700
<i>Hope for our children.</i>

477
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,400
<i>I cannot bear the guilt.</i>

478
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,000
<i>I cannot bear this child.</i>

479
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,800
<i>I hope you're listening when I'm gone.</i>

480
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Tori!

481
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,000
Oh, my God, don't do it! Don't do it!

482
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,700
Don't, Tori!

483
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,300
Come here.

484
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,100
Richard, I knew you'd come.

485
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,300
You still love me.

486
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,500
I love you so much.

487
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,100
I swear to God, everything's gonna be
just how it was. I promise.

488
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,800
But you got to step away from there.

489
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,000
I killed my baby.

490
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,900
It's okay. It's okay.

491
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,600
I love you, all right?

492
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,300
Now you just step away from there.
Just come to me.

493
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,500
That's it. Just come to me.

494
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,900
That's it.

495
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,000
<i>Five floors...</i>

<i>one hour.</i>

498
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,500
There's no way out.

499
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,500
We know everything.

500
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,700
How could you let them all die?

501
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,300
By giving them a quick, easy death...

502
01:17:55,700 --> 01:18:00,200
instead of the slow, agonizing decay
of disease.

503
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,100
Oh, I have always hated the weak.

504
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,800
They feed off the strong and the healthy.

505
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,200
They drain us of everything
until we are just like them.

506
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:16,600
Weak, pathetic invalids!

507
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,300
That's pretty selfish of them,
don't you think?

508
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,800
You're sick!

509
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:28,000
Oh, I'm afraid you're mistaken, my dear.

510
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,000
You're the one who's sick.

511
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,700
Can't you feel it?

512
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,500
Choking you from inside.

513
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:48,400
Squeezing the blood up into your brain
until it explodes.

514
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,200
Stop it! Leave her alone!

515
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,800
I'm disappointed in my own flesh and blood.

516
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,100
Infected by the plague of a conscience.

517
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,200
You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

518
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,700
I'm nothing like you!

519
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,400
You're both amongst the frail
and the weak...

520
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,900
from a disease you all call love.

521
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,700
And you don't even know you're sick.

522
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,200
Well, let me assure you...

523
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,000
there's no way out.

524
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,700
Only death.

525
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,200
Where am I?

526
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,600
He must have knocked us out.

527
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,500
Heather.

528
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,100
Heather.

529
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,300
Heather.

530
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,800
Heather.

531
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,500
Train, we gotta go.

532
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,900
I don't feel good.

533
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,700
I'm sick.

534
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,700
We gotta get out of here, he's coming back.

535
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,900
I can't leave.

536
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,500
Yes, you can. Come on.

537
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,700
There's something wrong.

538
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,000
I'm freezing.

539
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,600
What are we gonna do?

540
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,700
I don't feel good.

541
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,400
Vangard said the only way out of here
was death.

542
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,500
The only way out of here
is the Death Tunnel.

543
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,300
Come on.

544
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,200
So many people have died here.

545
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,100
So many souls. And he just killed them.

546
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,800
- The train, we gotta go.
- No. I can't leave.

547
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,300
Yes, you can. Come on. It's almost over.

548
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,900
They need our help.

549
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,800
We can't save them!

550
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,300
- I can't leave them.
- Don't you wanna live?

551
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,300
You don't understand.

552
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,800
Someone has to make things right.

553
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,600
Richard. I can't do this.

554
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,400
We need to find a cure.

555
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,200
Find? There was no cure.

556
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,900
Go on without me.

557
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,800
You're coming with me.
We're getting out of here. Come on.

558
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,900
There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

559
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,200
Who are you?

560
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,100
<i>Here, I am God.</i>

561
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,400
<i>I am Life.</i>

562
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,700
<i>I am Death.</i>

563
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,600
Heather, you're not sick.

564
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,900
<i>You're infected.</i>

565
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,300
<i>No one is curable.</i>

566
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,200
You can't have her!

567
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,800
- Heather?
- You don't understand.

568
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,300
<i>We're all related to someone who was here.</i>

569
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,400
Come on.

570
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,200
<i>Five ghosts?</i>

571
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,700
Incurable people.

572
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,200
- Richie, I can't leave.
- Come on.

573
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,200
<i>We all have a link to this place!</i>

574
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,100
Listen to me, Richie. I belong here.

575
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,700
Who's on the fifth floor?

576
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,500
Don't you get it?

577
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:39,100
This is the last thing they saw
before they died!

578
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,800
Damn it! Come on!

579
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,900
Come on!

580
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,700
<i>A light at the end of a tunnel.</i>

581
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,200
<i>This is where she died.</i>

582
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,300
Who died?

583
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Me.

584
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,500
Me.

585
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,700
Oh, Richie. Don't.

586
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,500
It's okay.

587
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,800
It's going to be all right.

588
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,800
- It's contagious.
- I don't care.

589
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,300
Just go.

590
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,800
Save yourself.

591
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,000
It's settled then.

592
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,200
Come on, we're gonna find the cure.
