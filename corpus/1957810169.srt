00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,333
Good morning, sis.

1
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:44,700
You do know that mornings

2
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,300
are the worst time
to call me, right?

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm trying to plan
mom's big birthday

4
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,233
and I need your help.
Mom's big...

5
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,567
She's turning 59.

6
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,967
But she refuses to have a 60th,

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,367
so we have to do a big 59.

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,580
Okay. Can I call you later?

9
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,533
What's been going on with
that guy you were seeing?

10
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,133
Eric.

11
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:05,346
Okay. Okay, Janelle, I
can't do this right now, okay?

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
I love you.

13
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:09,467
Bye.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,767
Call Peter the doorman.

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,000
Pete, it's Jade Taylor.

16
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,409
Forgot to tell
you on my way out,

17
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,433
my ex is stopping by
to pick up his things.

18
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,533
We have an agreement,
half an hour, no more.

19
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,433
If that's a problem,
let me know. Thank you.

20
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,367
There you are.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,876
The congresswoman's
office just called.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,109
She's coming over now
for the interview.

23
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:24,834
What? Now?

24
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,467
Yes, now.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,409
She's been called back to
DC for an emergency session

26
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,142
so she's stopping by on
the way to the airport.

27
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,667
Okay. Prep studio
three for filming.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,300
Studio three's on the air.

29
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:35,333
- Studio two.
- On the air.

30
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,467
Studio one?

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,640
- On the air.
- On the air?

32
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,276
Okay, get two field
cameras and lighting set up

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,609
on the 11th floor
conference room.

34
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,834
We do this remote.

35
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:42,800
Remote from
the CNB Headquarters?

36
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:43,433
- Mm-hm.
- Got it.

37
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,300
Oh, here. How are you?

38
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:46,166
Has he called?

39
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,433
La rata.

40
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,433
Should I ask?

41
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,867
Okay, I'm fine. Don't worry.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,467
You're not fine.
No one could be fine.

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,109
People break up all
the time, you know.

44
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,500
Yeah, but not like this.

45
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,800
He said he loved you, moved
in, which is huge for you.

46
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,376
And then-
I can't do this right now.

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,533
The Congresswoman is coming.

48
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,900
The Congresswoman?

49
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,400
The Congresswoman.

50
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,333
That's good. That's good, Ted.

51
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,033
And now just clarify,
what year was that?

52
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,242
What year was that, exactly?

53
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,567
That would've been January 2014.

54
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,367
2014, okay.

55
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,600
And you were at the time

56
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,500
an assistant DA in
your current district?

57
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,876
The amount of
information being leaked

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,333
brings to mind the
scandal that hit

59
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:24,233
the New Jersey DA's
office a few years back.

60
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,443
What are your thoughts on that

61
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,533
and where do you think
these leaks are coming from?

62
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,333
The amount of
information being leaked

63
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,000
brings to mind the
scandal that hit

64
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:35,066
the New Jersey DA's
office a few years back.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,242
What are your thoughts on that

66
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,367
and where do you think
the leaks are coming from?

67
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
Ted, I can't comment

68
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,367
on an open case, you know that.

69
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,066
But what I can say
is that I can promise

70
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,333
that we will be taking
appropriate action

71
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,433
pending the investigation.

72
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,407
But don't you think
the public deserves to know

73
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,533
what happened and
who was involved?

74
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,433
I mean, these people are
paid with tax payer dollars.

75
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:59,333
The public will know the truth

76
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:00,667
as soon as we do, Ted.

77
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,876
So what you're
saying is you never

78
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,033
really loved me in
the first place, hm?

79
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,509
So what you're
saying is you never

80
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,400
really loved me in
the first place.

81
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,533
No. No!

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,133
Let me rephrase the question.

83
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:21,567
Look, I started
you here as an intern

84
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,242
and you were living
with seven roommates

85
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,400
doing coffee runs and
editing puff pieces.

86
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,600
You're now one of our
most valued news producers

87
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,467
and if what just happened
had happened to anyone else,

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,943
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

89
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:36,433
Again, I am so sorry.

90
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,667
We've known each
other a long time Jade,

91
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,233
and I know you going
through a breakup.

92
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,600
The truth is, I'm almost
glad this has happened

93
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,567
because I need you, Jade.

94
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,633
And I'm worried your next
step is about to be burnout.

95
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:53,133
You've worked so
hard to get here,

96
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,567
but now you need
to take a breath

97
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,800
and the network wants you
to take a leave of absence

98
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,767
and that doesn't
mean work from home.

99
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,166
Well, I do have
a ridiculous amount

100
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,600
of vacation time racked up.

101
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,233
I'll come back fresh,

102
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:15,667
I'll show the top floor
who I am, what I can do.

103
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,700
You're going to
need to do just that.

104
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,000
What happened?

105
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,266
We're going for a drink.

106
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,667
Book me someplace chic and
quiet, make sure there's a beach.

107
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,734
Looks like I'm
going on vacation.

108
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,367
Excuse me.

109
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,600
Is there a supermarket
around here?

110
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,967
Yes, ma'am we have a market.

111
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,467
Great.

112
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,467
Uh, this is it?

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,266
You don't have anything bigger?

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,467
This is it.

115
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,266
I'll be quick, then.

116
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
Where's your frozen
food section?

117
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,834
New York.

118
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,667
Ah.

119
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,300
Ah, well, this is it.

120
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:37,734
Okay.

121
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:43,800
Keys under the
mat as instructed.

122
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:25,367
Okay.

123
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:40,800
I bet things are falling
apart without me.

124
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,567
Hm.

125
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,276
And also, I don't want
anyone besides you

126
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,340
covering the Johnson case.

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,567
He's evasive.

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,400
You have to stay on him.

129
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:55,573
Keep an eye out for Peter.

130
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,867
I know he's gonna wanna
steal that art scandal story.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,800
That is ours, and that's how
I'm gonna get back on track.

132
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:03,967
What else?

133
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,266
Jade, what are you doing?

134
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,133
Turn it off.

135
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,767
You're on vacation.

136
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,800
You should be at a
beach bar or stargazing.

137
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:13,033
Start a shell
collection, anything.

138
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:18,000
Stop. I am fine, and I'm
perfectly capable of relaxing.

139
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:22,133
Matter of fact, I'm
going to relax right now.

140
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,533
Good night.

141
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,900
What was that?

142
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,800
Who put that chair there?

143
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,467
Hold it.

144
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,700
Hold it right there.

145
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,200
Who are you, and what
are you doing here?

146
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,867
And what have you
done to my furniture?

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Huh?

148
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,000
Excuse me? Who are you?

149
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,367
This is my house. I live here.

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,667
What?

151
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,867
Well, not for the next
two weeks you don't.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
What are you talking about?

153
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,834
And put, put my lamp down.

154
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,834
I rented this place, or
rather my assistant did

155
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:06,967
on Luxury Away.

156
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Look.

157
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,000
This is my confirmation
and the instructions. Here.

158
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,476
Well, I am sorry to be
the one to tell you this,

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,860
but you have been
properly scammed.

160
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,266
This place is not for rent.

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,242
They said that the keys
would be under the mat

162
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,567
and the keys were under the mat,

163
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,633
so why would you do that?

164
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:28,910
Well that's where
I'll leave them

165
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,667
because this is Maceo Island.

166
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,633
But I, but I paid
and then they...

167
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,667
Look, I'm Ford, it's late.

168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,500
Clearly you have a situation,
but I'm going to bed.

169
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,700
You can crash here in the
extra bedroom until the morning

170
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:47,967
when you find something.

171
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,309
No, thanks. Thanks
but no thanks.

172
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,967
I'm not staying at
a stranger's house.

173
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,867
Well, you already are.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,967
And the bedroom door locks.

175
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,343
Plus you rearranged
my furniture.

176
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,533
Yeah, sorry about that,

177
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,233
but yeah, I'm still not staying.

178
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,734
Well I'm not
exactly begging you.

179
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:04,033
Look, I'm gonna go to bed

180
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,606
and pretend that
this never happened.

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay, go on.

182
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,567
Don't worry about me.

183
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
New York.

184
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,166
Morning.

185
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,166
No room at the inn?

186
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,133
I've checked everything.

187
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:07,133
It's a small island,
so everything's booked.

188
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,967
Well, little under
the radar island

189
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,376
is not exactly the
best place to look

190
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,233
for a last minute
reservation, so.

191
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,967
Right.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,109
Well, I'll get out of your way

193
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,266
since it's morning and I'll
put your furniture back

194
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,000
where I found it, okay?

195
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,467
Thank you.

196
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,133
Sure.

197
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,376
I really think this chair
works right here, though.

198
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
You should consider it.

199
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,266
Thank you. I like
it where I have it.

200
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,734
It's just a suggestion.

201
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,066
No, please, just...

202
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
This place is amazing.

203
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,000
What is it that you do?

204
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm not rich or anything,

205
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,500
but it's easy to live
a better life here.

206
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,943
Well, I actually
didn't wanna come here

207
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,133
in the first place.

208
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:52,133
I was literally forced
to take a vacation,

209
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,934
if you can believe it.

210
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:54,700
Literally?

211
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:55,633
Literally, yes.

212
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,767
Well, a leave of absence.

213
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,600
The vacation was my idea,

214
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:03,000
'cause apparently I
don't know how to relax.

215
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,133
You don't say.

216
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,500
Well, that's what everyone
keeps telling me, so.

217
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,000
Hm.

218
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,276
You know, I was thinking
this painting, it-

219
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
No.

220
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,367
It's one thing to
have a bad vacation,

221
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,167
it's another to pack up,
come all the way here

222
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,734
and have no vacation at all.

223
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:27,734
Make that make sense.

224
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,033
So it's back to
the airport for me.

225
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,133
Do you know what time
the water taxis start?

226
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,333
Look, I...

227
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:39,066
I really hope I don't regret
this, but we are both adults.

228
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,066
This place is, it's pretty
big. It's got two bathrooms.

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,867
If you can keep to yourself and
not bother me, you can stay.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,176
But only until
something else opens up

231
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
and I'm not your host, okay?

232
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,376
I'm not gonna be your tour
guide or anything like that.

233
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
No, I didn't think
that, but thank you.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,266
You gonna stay or what?

235
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,066
Look, here.

236
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,734
All right, whatever you decide,

237
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,676
if you decide to head out,
just go ahead and lock up

238
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,467
and leave the key
under the mat, okay?

239
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,900
Hey.

240
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:19,667
Don't touch.

241
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Sorry.

242
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:34,467
I can't believe I'm
doing this, Courtney.

243
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,834
I'm staying with a
complete stranger.

244
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:39,734
I can't believe a
stranger is letting you stay.

245
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:42,066
Well, he seems all right.

246
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,009
Little bit familiar, but
you know I won't be seeing

247
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:47,600
much of him anyway 'cause
now I've got something to do.

248
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:48,934
What do you mean?

249
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,076
What do you mean,
"what do you mean?"

250
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,834
This is a great story.

251
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,233
Have Gabby send me
everything that she can find

252
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,633
on vacation rental scams

253
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,166
and run a background check
on these Luxury Way people.

254
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,166
Boy are they gonna be sorry.

255
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,867
I guess it's
futile to remind you

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,900
that you are on vacation.

257
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,400
Excuse me, have we met?

258
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,000
I have been scammed.

259
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,166
I'm not gonna get a pina
colada and sit on the beach.

260
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,700
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

261
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:15,967
Of course you are.

262
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,333
- See ya.
- Bye.

263
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,667
What is up with the goat?

264
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,333
Okay, how hard can it be?

265
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:50,467
Ooh!

266
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Here we go.

267
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,033
Wow.

268
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,309
Lady, wrong
side. Wrong side.

269
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh. Sorry!

270
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,333
Hello again.

271
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,467
Could you tell me where
the police station is?

272
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,033
Oh, hi.

273
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,934
I would like to report a crime.

274
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,200
- A crime?
- Yes.

275
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,433
What kind of crime?

276
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,900
I was scammed.

277
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,133
By who?

278
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:39,734
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

279
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,300
Okay.

280
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,700
My assistant rented this
place for me from Luxury Away.

281
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,433
I don't know if they've done
that to anyone here before.

282
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,300
I mean, does this
happen a lot here?

283
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:51,734
No.

284
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,400
Mm-hm, mm-hm, and
what about this guy?

285
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:54,967
Says his name is Ford.

286
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,600
American. Says it's his place.

287
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,233
Has it happened there before?

288
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:00,600
No.

289
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,300
I would like to get
to the bottom of it.

290
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,834
Okay.

291
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,200
Are you gonna, are
you gonna file a report?

292
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,743
I'll go back to the
station and get that form.

293
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,166
I'll be back in 10 to 15.

294
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,000
Okay, I will meet
you right here.

295
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:27,834
We can do this.

296
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,633
- Ford.
- Yep?

297
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you have some
lady staying with you?

298
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,467
Yep.

299
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,433
Is she all right?

300
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,567
I have no idea.

301
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:43,867
I should have trusted my gun.

302
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,500
Well, you are the one
who asked her to stay.

303
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,300
Yeah well, she got scammed.

304
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,433
I felt bad for her.

305
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,400
And here she comes.

306
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,133
Hey, what's up?

307
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
This is your shop?

308
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,100
Yeah.

309
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,233
It's nice.

310
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
So about this scam...

311
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,614
I know everyone on the island
and no one here scammed you.

312
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,176
I mean whoever did it is
somewhere far, far away

313
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,367
across the vast ocean
someplace so my advice to you?

314
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Let it go.

315
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,100
This is Hughes, my friend.

316
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,100
Good morning.

317
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,033
It's nice to meet you.

318
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,567
I take it you're staying?

319
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:28,867
Well yes.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Like I said, I'm here to relax.

321
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,033
Hmm.

322
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,166
Well lucky me.

323
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Goodbye.

324
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,066
See you later.

325
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,266
Mm, potentially
linked, you guys.

326
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,433
Mr. Ford?

327
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,066
Good morning!

328
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Hi.

329
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,567
Are you Ford's girlfriend?

330
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,333
No.

331
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,266
Well, can you
tell him for tonight

332
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,934
three for McPherson,
two for Ferguson?

333
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,333
Three and two what?

334
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,166
He'll know.

335
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,467
Have a nice day.

336
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:23,767
Three and two for Ferguson?

337
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:25,533
I don't know.

338
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,133
Hey, how's it going?

339
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:34,166
Take down an illegal
daiquiri cart?

340
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,567
Bootleg sun tan lotion gang?

341
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,500
Very funny. I am
trying to relax.

342
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,667
Good morning lady.

343
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh hi.

344
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:44,767
You Ford's girlfriend?

345
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,066
No.

346
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh, okay.

347
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,266
This bag is from my mom.

348
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,900
She said to tell Ford
three for Phillips.

349
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,033
Bye.

350
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,266
Bye.

351
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,867
Three...

352
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,467
I don't know, this house is
getting a lot of traffic.

353
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,333
I feel like something's
going on here.

354
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,767
Maybe I should look
further into this Ford guy.

355
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,700
I mean, I am staying with him.

356
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,900
What? The guy's guilty
of having a social life?

357
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,266
Look, I am begging
you, go find a hammock

358
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,500
and a bottle of rosé.

359
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,567
It's Jade on the
phone. She's relaxing.

360
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,433
Why does everyone think this
is so funny? I am relaxing.

361
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Bye.

362
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:50,467
So you're really embracing
the island life, I see.

363
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,433
Mm.

364
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,567
Mm-hm.

365
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:54,967
You have a list.

366
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,934
McPherson, Ferguson, Phillips.

367
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,100
Three, two and three.

368
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,834
You know, there's a
Lo Lo down the street.

369
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,033
What's a Lo Lo?

370
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,000
Just a local spot.

371
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,633
It's like big drum grills,

372
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,033
barbecue chicken, curried
chicken, grilled prawns.

373
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:16,033
It's delicious, not like that
chemical bomb you're eating.

374
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,367
My food is delicious.

375
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:19,700
Sure.

376
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,000
Big plans?

377
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,567
Just meeting friends.

378
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,633
Why, you wanna come?

379
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, no.

380
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,533
I'm okay. Thank you.

381
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,867
All right. Well,
uh, you enjoy it.

382
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:03,734
Hey.

383
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,767
What are you doing?

384
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,300
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

385
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,967
Oh, well I was looking
for the Lo Lo place.

386
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,367
Follow me.

387
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,567
(Ic)

388
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:37,967
Oh, look what I found.

389
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,934
Hey.

390
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,700
Hi Jade.

391
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,467
Hi.

392
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,266
What are those?

393
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
These are Johnnycakes.

394
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,033
Big thing here in
this island, you see.

395
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,700
Mine are the best.

396
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I got the recipe off my
great Aunt Eda one evening

397
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,567
after she had too
much rum punch.

398
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,300
Yeah, it's his parents'
40th wedding anniversary.

399
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,967
Oh, the numbers were RSVPs.

400
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:06,100
How many people
are coming. Right.

401
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,533
Oh, amazingly, it's
still a surprise.

402
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,767
That's the downside of
living on a small island.

403
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:12,834
You should join us.

404
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,142
Look, I know I
said that I wasn't

405
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,967
gonna be your tour
guide, but, uh,

406
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
if you really came here to relax

407
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,400
then you gotta go full island.

408
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,033
Hm? Yes or no?

409
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:27,800
We gotta get this
done before night

410
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:30,200
when our guests of honor arrive.

411
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,100
Yeah, I'm down.

412
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,867
Let's do it.

413
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,700
Ooh.

414
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:37,834
Okay.

415
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,033
You sure these things work?

416
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,433
Not bad, eh?

417
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:54,367
You two, I cannot believe
you planned all this.

418
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,467
Of course. It's my parents'
anniversary. I'm their son.

419
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
One second

420
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:07,300
Jade.

421
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,066
Hm?

422
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,066
Put the phone away.

423
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
Come on, it's time to party.

424
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:12,767
Right.

425
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Thank you.

426
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,934
- Yeah?
- Yes.

427
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,133
Great.

428
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:22,767
Good evening.

429
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,600
I wanted to apologize for not
properly introducing myself.

430
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm Jade Taylor.

431
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,100
Ah, yes. Our new guest.

432
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:32,467
How's the crime fighting going?

433
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,467
I'm Hibbert. This is Miss Maris.

434
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,367
Enjoying all that
rosé and frozen food?

435
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,266
Cheers.
Cheers.

436
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Cheers.

437
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:45,767
Nice to meet you.

438
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,567
Jade, there's someone
I want you to meet.

439
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,967
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

440
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,900
This is Ingrid, my fiance.

441
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,100
Nice to meet you, Jade.

442
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,400
You as well.

443
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:58,973
Ingrid manages the
spa on the island.

444
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,967
The best spa on the island.

445
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,900
The only spa on the island.

446
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,800
Here they come.

447
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,200
Surprise!

448
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh my.

449
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:27,633
Ladies and gentlemen,
the happy couple.

450
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:28,900
40 years.

451
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,200
Let's have a few words.

452
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,533
Thank you.

453
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,600
We had no idea.

454
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:45,934
My son, the notary,
he makes us so proud.

455
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:47,800
And look, he's done so again.

456
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,133
So thank you all for
coming. Thank you.

457
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:55,233
Well, one day, many years ago,

458
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,109
whilst I was working at
my father's restaurant,

459
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:03,166
the most beautiful woman
entered with her family

460
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,667
and we have built a beautiful
life together.

461
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
Come, my love, say something.

462
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,967
Giving this one a chance

463
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,800
was the best thing
that I ever did.

464
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,066
My son.

465
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,934
And Ford.

466
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:24,100
Thank you.

467
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:29,467
Everyone, please,
enjoy yourself.

468
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:31,767
Now...

469
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,000
Let's lime.

470
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,166
Come.

471
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:41,767
Let's dance.

472
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,934
Oh.

Morning.

482
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,000
I made breakfast
if you wanna join.

483
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,166
Oh, morning.

484
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,567
Only one condition,
your phone is not invited.

485
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,367
Oh, I'm just finishing up...

486
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,333
- Work stuff.
- Work stuff.

487
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:31,467
Yeah.

488
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
It smells nice.

489
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,700
So, Ford, tell me
something about yourself.

490
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,967
Uh, there's not
really much to tell.

491
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,300
Just out here living
my best island life.

492
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:53,133
You're from the states. Where?

493
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,934
What were you doing before this?

494
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,467
Why all the questions?

495
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,367
I'm just trying
to get to know you.

496
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,367
You gotta give me
something. Come on.

497
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
All right, fine.

498
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,033
I'm from Jersey.

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Jersey?

500
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,200
Interesting.

501
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,400
Where's your accent?

502
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:13,533
What accent?

503
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:17,867
Yo, Vinny, where's my pork roll?

504
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,533
First of all, it's Taylor Ham

505
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,100
and I don't know anyone
who speaks like that, so...

506
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,266
Okay.

507
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Where'd you go to college?

508
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,900
Oh.

509
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,100
More questions.

510
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,867
Sorry.

511
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,900
It's in my nature.
I'm a news producer.

512
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,433
Really?

513
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,233
Now you seem surprised.

514
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,633
No. No, I'm not.

515
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,533
It actually makes perfect sense.

516
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,834
Hello?

517
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:45,767
Jane?

518
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,066
We're up top, Ingrid.

519
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,066
Good morning.

520
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,867
Hey.

521
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,767
You ready?

522
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Ready for what?

523
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,200
Ford told us what happened
with the rental scam.

524
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,233
That is no way to start
a vacation, you see,

525
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,600
so we are giving you a do-over.

526
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:06,400
A spa day, on us.

527
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:07,934
No.

528
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:09,266
That's amazing.

529
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,433
Really?

530
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,133
Yes.

531
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:12,967
Go.

532
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Go, have fun.

533
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Oh my gosh.

534
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,467
Thank you.

535
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,200
Ingrid, this is stunning.

536
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,367
Thank you.

537
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:43,700
Vacation reboot starts now.

538
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,367
I like the way you think.

539
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,233
Oh.

540
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,300
Sorry.

541
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,300
So how long have you and
Hughes been together?

542
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:29,633
We've known each other
since we were kids,

543
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,476
but then he went off to
boarding school, you see,

544
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,100
so we reconnected when
he came home for summers.

545
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:39,867
Got engaged when he came
home from university.

546
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,734
He's a good one, Hughes.
Yeah.

547
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:45,200
His father mentioned
he's a notary?

548
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,333
What is that here?

549
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,667
Here?

550
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,300
It's prestigious.

551
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,433
It's like being a lawyer.

552
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,367
Wow.

553
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,166
And his father is very proud.

554
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,567
Yeah. I got that.

555
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:03,367
Unfortunately it's, it's
not what Hughes wants.

556
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,266
You saw him cooking
last night, right?

557
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,066
Yes.

558
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,367
It was delicious.

559
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:13,367
I know. He's so talented.

560
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,834
He wants to take over the
family beach restaurant.

561
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,900
Just, after all that education,

562
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:20,734
he can't disappoint his parents.

563
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:22,834
Hm.

564
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,600
I feel so lucky.

565
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:29,066
I wake up every morning
excited to go to work,

566
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,633
and love what I do,
so I feel for him.

567
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:35,533
So do I.

568
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:42,433
But things like that don't
matter to Pops Hughes.

569
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,934
So, what do you think of Ford?

570
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,700
Uh, I barely know him.

571
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,667
Why?

572
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,200
Why? Because he's a catch.

573
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,934
The man is kind and easy
on the eyes and so forth.

574
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:03,066
Have you not noticed?

575
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,100
I didn't really come to
the island looking for love.

576
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:10,233
I just went through a breakup

577
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,800
and I was thrown
off when I met him.

578
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,174
I thought I was getting robbed.

579
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,333
I was holding a
lamp above my head,

580
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,934
ready to take this swing at him.

581
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,567
He's a tough one, though.

582
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,800
But so great and so handsome.

583
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,066
But so very private.

584
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,667
What?

585
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Notice now?

586
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,500
Come on, sit.

587
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:50,633
Relax.

588
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,900
I'm gonna go help mum with
today's produce delivery.

589
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:00,033
Okay.

590
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,867
Talk about burying the lead.

591
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:50,567
Anyone care for some fresh
ceviche and a cold beer?

592
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,734
Uh, I'm okay, thanks.

593
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,900
I've got some things
I need to get done.

594
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,200
What about you, Ford?
You around later?

595
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah.

596
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,467
Yeah.

597
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,266
Why?

598
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
I have a surprise for you.

599
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:09,266
It's a, a thank you surprise.

600
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
Hm.

601
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,667
A surprise.

602
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,333
Don't.

603
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,333
Good afternoon, Miss Maris.

604
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,266
Hey.

605
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
You hungry?

606
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I'm cooking.

607
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,367
You cook?

608
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,467
Yes, of course I
cook. That's insulting.

609
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,467
I'm from Louisiana.

610
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,700
I just never really
have time to slow down

611
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:02,000
and do it right, that's all.

612
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,500
Well, I mean, I thought
you were from New York.

613
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,300
I mean, where's your accent?

614
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:08,166
Oh, I lost it.

615
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,309
I moved to New York right
after I graduated college.

616
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,633
I couldn't wait to get there.

617
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:14,367
You literally have
no accent. Can't tell.

618
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,800
I took diction classes.

619
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,867
All I cared about was
being Christiane Amanpour.

620
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,500
I never made it on air myself,

621
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:24,200
but I got there as
fast as I could,

622
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:27,934
threw myself into it and
I'm like a native now.

623
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,066
Hm.

624
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,433
What are you cooking?

625
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:34,800
Jambalaya.

626
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:35,934
You wanna help?

627
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,333
♪ Oh yeah ♪

628
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:44,333

629
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:48,934

Taste?

633
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,934
Good. Could use a little more.

634
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,200
- Oh?
- Mm-hm.

635
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:07,734
Keep it coming. Come on.

636
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:08,934
Oh, okay.

637
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,600
I ain't scared
of a little spice.

638
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:15,233
All right.

639
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,100
Let's see if you
can take the heat...

640
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,867
Or get out of the kitchen.

641
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:25,066
Is that too much for you?

642
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,533
Bay-bay.

643
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:29,333
Yeah?

644
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,100
Now that's good.

645
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,233
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

646
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,533
We're spicy simpatico, then.

647
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,500
Mm-hm, I believe I'm
a little Louisiana now.

648
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,800
My ex thought Tabasco
sauce was strong.

649
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,600
Yes, my ex was a punk.

650
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:55,333
So, tell me about this
spice deficient ex of yours.

651
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,166
Oh, I don't wanna bore
you with my love life

652
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,500
or lack thereof.

653
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:01,273
Oh, okay, so you get
to ask the questions,

654
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,600
but you don't have
to answer 'em?

655
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:03,734
Fair enough.

656
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,800
He claimed that I put work
before our relationship,

657
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:09,934
which is not true.

658
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:13,700
It's a little bit true,

659
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:19,700
but he wasn't the one and my
life is very fast paced and...

660
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,533
You wouldn't understand.

661
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,500
I mean, your island in
life is the exact opposite

662
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,300
of my New York life.

663
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:29,767
Actually, I do.

664
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,266
I do understand.

665
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,166
You actually remind me of
someone I used to know.

666
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,867
Gotta post a few
vacation photos.

667
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,633
Are you on social media?

668
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:54,767
No.

669
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:56,633
Facebook? Twitter?

670
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,066
Nothing?

671
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Nope, nope, nope.

672
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,567
Hm.

673
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,000
Just like my privacy, mm.

674
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,133
I get that.

675
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,400
One question, and
one question only.

676
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:10,734
Go ahead, ask.

677
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,367
Have you ever been in love?

678
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,066
Yeah, I had a fiance once.

679
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,133
Three years ago.

680
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:29,200
What happened?

681
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,667
I said one question.

682
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,200
It's a follow up question.

683
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,967
Listen, um there's
a big celebration

684
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,667
tomorrow at the yacht club.

685
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,333
Would you like to, you
know, maybe be my...

686
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,000
Your?

687
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,233
My plus one?

688
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,033
Mm?

689
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,767
It's gonna be a
special celebration.

690
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,367
Team Hughes won the
Annual Sailing Race

691
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,934
last year, three peat, so.

692
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,700
You're a sailor?

693
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:04,000
Ah, just part of a team.

694
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,142
The winner of the final
gets to keep the Cup

695
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,743
until the start of
the new racing season,

696
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,133
so this is like our farewell
celebration for that.

697
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,066
It's kind of a big deal.

698
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,934
Big deal?

699
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:16,066
Oh, yeah.

700
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:18,967
Love to be your plus one.

701
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:24,233
Cool.

702
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Hey, sailor?

703
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:40,367
Yes?

704
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,800
What's the attire
for this thing?

705
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,734
Island formal.

706
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:47,967
Got it.

707
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,400
Island formal.

708
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll meet you at the cart in 30.

709
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Wow.

710
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,133
Okay, what?

711
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,467
Nothing.

712
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,834
Nothing, you just clean up
really nice, that's all.

713
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,133
For a second there, I...

714
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:36,100
I can't place it.

715
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,100
I thought you looked
familiar, but...

716
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:41,033
Well, you probably
recognize me from,

717
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:46,000
you know, my days as
a former GQ model.

718
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Right.

719
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,633
Okay, okay, it
wasn't that funny.

720
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:12,300
Ford!

721
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,333
Jade.

722
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,333
Have fun.

723
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,033
I'll catch up with you later.

724
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,133
Hey.

725
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:27,500
Remember earlier
when I said wow?

726
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
I meant it.

727
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:37,533
Oh!

728
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,133
Hey!

729
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,467
- You all right?
- Man.

730
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,300
Hey.

731
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:45,200
Hey, come on, man, hey.

732
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,500
Hey.

733
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:47,800
How are you?

734
00:41:47,934 --> 00:41:48,934
Don't.

735
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,166
I wasn't going to say
anything. Not a thing.

736
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:56,467
What's up?

737
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,734
Who's that?

738
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:02,166
Two execs from a
chain restaurant.

739
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,266
And Pop's putting on
a dog and pony show.

740
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,033
They don't belong here.

741
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,133
They're not part of
this celebration.

742
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,409
You know, once
he makes this deal,

743
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:15,000
there's no going back, right?

744
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,066
Yeah.

745
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,000
And he's gonna make a whole
lot of money off this deal.

746
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,934
He can retire rich and
proud his son's a notary.

747
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:32,967
Oh.

748
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,934
I'll just be a
second. Excuse me.

749
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,600
Hello?

750
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,433
Hey, you're on speaker.

751
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:45,967
I'm with Gabby.

752
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,767
Hi Jade. We just wanted
to check in with you.

753
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,142
You know, I've done
a lot of digging

754
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,400
and your vacation
rental scam thing

755
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:54,367
could actually be
a bigger story.

756
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Oh.

757
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,734
Okay, cool.

758
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:58,600
That could just be
the story that I need.

759
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:02,367
But no rush. We can flush
it out when I get back.

760
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Well look at you.

761
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,400
Yes, and check this out.

762
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:14,867
How's that for having
fun in the sun, hm?

763
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,100
Oh, and can you
check him out for me?

764
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:23,000
He seems a little
familiar or something.

765
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,133
I just can't place it.

766
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,200
I knew you couldn't
help yourself.

767
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,333
Okay you two, I'll
talk to you later.

768
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:32,834
I'm officially turning off
my phone for the night.

769
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:33,967
Bye.

770
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:37,934
I'm sorry.

771
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:39,667
Did that just happen?
Yes.

772
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:43,000
What's up?

773
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:45,133
Oh, nothing. We were
on the phone with Jade.

774
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:46,300
How lovely.

775
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,967
Let me remind you, she's on
vacation, you two aren't.

776
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,767
Let's go. Ratings
don't make themselves.

777
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,500

Hey there.

796
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:05,133
You okay?

797
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,767
When you gonna talk to him?

798
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:11,533
Soon.

799
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:13,567
Soon?

800
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:16,400
We get married soon, Hughes.

801
00:45:16,533 --> 00:45:17,834
Yes, we do.

802
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:21,133
So it needs to be before that.

803
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:22,266
Why?

804
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,800
I love you, Hughes,

805
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:27,767
which means I want a
happy and proud husband.

806
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,066
Being a notary makes
your father happy,

807
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,967
but does it truly
make you happy?

808
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,066
I'm proud of you no
matter what you do,

809
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,500
as long as you do the
right thing for your heart.

810
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:47,667
Hey, hey, you guys.

811
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,033
Hello?

812
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,266
Come on you two.

813
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,000
Come on, let's dance.
What are you doing?

814
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:55,266
Aye.

815
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,934
Oh, please, please don't.

816
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:04,100
She's right. He
does look familiar.

817
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:08,633
Wait a minute.

818
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,567
Gabby.

819
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,033
Can you bring me the file?

820
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:18,266
You know the one on the
New Jersey DA scandal?

821
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:20,700
Thanks.

822
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,200
Hey, what's up?

823
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,333
Right there.

824
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:35,433
Lose the beard and it's him.

825
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,233
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

826
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:40,700
Malcolm Elliot Jr.?

827
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,133
(Dr)

828
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:09,500
"I am officially
inviting you on a date."

829
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,166
Please spend the day with me.

830
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,467
P.S., your phone is not invited.

831
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
"Ford."

832
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,867
Of course.

833
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,333
All right.

834
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,943
Please tell me something
has changed from last night.

835
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:28,266
I didn't sleep at all.

836
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,467
I spent it researching
Malcolm Elliot Jr.

837
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,166
Right after the case blew
up, he just disappeared.

838
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,934
There was no sign
of him anywhere.

839
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:36,967
Look at this.

840
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,533
Has to be the same guy.

841
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,633
Well, here's a call
I don't want to make.

842
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:12,600
Jerk chicken, spicy.

843
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,967
Oh, make that
two. Extra spicy.

844
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,100
Mm.

845
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:18,500
Okay. I'll
bring it right now.

846
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:19,633
Thank you.

847
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,166
First concert?

848
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,700
Nas with my older
brother. Yours?

849
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,567
BSB with my younger sister.

850
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:28,800
Really owe her a phone call.

851
00:48:28,934 --> 00:48:30,967
Wait, I'm sorry. What's BSB?

852
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,000
Backstreet Boys.

853
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:34,500
You gotta be kidding me.

854
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:36,133
What?

855
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:39,500
Well, I just, no, I never
thought you'd be so corny.

856
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:41,533
Okay, I am not corny.

857
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,400
Were there any other Black
people where you grew up?

858
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:50,166
BSB has a very diverse
audience, thank you very much.

859
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,700
And "I Want It That Way"
is a brilliant pop song.

860
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:54,567
Pop songs are underrated.

861
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,976
People will be listening to them

862
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,533
for years to come,
like Beethoven.

863
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,166
Are you kidding me?

864
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,433
Wow, I, yeah, I was with you
until Beethoven.

865
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:12,834
So what was your life
like before you moved here?

866
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
It was, um...

867
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
It was busy.

868
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,667
Too busy to realize
what really mattered.

869
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:28,367
That's why I'm always on you
about the phone, you know?

870
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,033
It creates a barrier,
a distraction.

871
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,633
Makes it hard to be present.

872
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,700
Yeah.

873
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,900
Yeah, I get it.

874
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,333
It's just, it's how
things are done.

875
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:46,433
That's how life is right
now. You can't turn it off.

876
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:47,967
You slow down, you're done.

877
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:50,333
No, I don't think so.

878
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:53,367
I think we have a choice.

879
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,467
Is that why you moved here?

880
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Was that a choice?

881
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,734
It's one of the reasons, yeah.

882
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:06,066
I can just be, here.

883
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,166
I get it.

884
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,066
I understand, 'cause
I'm always just going,

885
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,767
going, going, and maybe I do...

886
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:21,734
Nevermind.

887
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,300
So is this it for you?

888
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:30,133
Just beaches, sunsets.

889
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:32,633
Island life forever.

890
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,233
First of all, that's
a terrible accent.

891
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:39,200
But no, not exactly.

892
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,600
I have a business here.

893
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,800
And here we go.

894
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:45,567
Ooh-wee.

895
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,967
Hope you keep your water full.

896
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,367
Thank you.

897
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
the jerk has arrived.

898
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:52,734
Right.

899
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,967
Who needs water?

900
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,100
We got this.

901
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:58,533
It's delicious.

902
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:00,200
Not spicy enough.
Ooh.

903
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,467
Is that the goat from
outside of your house?

904
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,333
Mm-hm, sure is.

905
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:13,967
She wanders around
town now and then.

906
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,533
Miss Edith adopted her, but
she hangs out with all of us.

907
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:20,000
This is Shirley.

908
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:23,333
Three time Miss Maceo
Island pageant winner.

909
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:25,166
Wait, wait, what am I hearing?

910
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,967
There's actually a
goat beauty pageant?

911
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,934
Yep, every year. It
is an island tradition.

912
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:35,166
Hence the photo and the sash.

913
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,433
This is good.

914
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:38,042
Yeah, it's this very,
very serious event.

915
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:38,867
Oh.

916
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,166
- Mm-hm.
- Sorry.

917
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,600
Just not a fan of
beauty pageants.

918
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:45,600
My sister Janelle was
a beauty pageant queen.

919
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:47,467
We're very different.

920
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,633
Well you know, that's
the thing about family.

921
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:53,100
You know, sometimes they
can work your last nerve,

922
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:55,834
but so what, you know?

923
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:57,276
And like you said,
you're different.

924
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,834
You can't leave 'em in the past.

925
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:01,609
After all, they're the ones
who will always have your back.

926
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:03,567
That's right.

927
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,667
Even if she tells me
that my job doesn't matter

928
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,266
because I'm behind the camera.

929
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:11,767
- Hey man.
- Hey.

930
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,700
Afternoon, Jade.

931
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:14,834
Hello, Hughes.

932
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,142
What you doing
out the office, man?

933
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,443
Oh, heading back
to the restaurant

934
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,233
to help my mom with
some bookkeeping.

935
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,900
Oh, you're such a good son.

936
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,333
Well, even though someone told
me to leave my phone behind,

937
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:27,710
don't think I'm
not getting a photo

938
00:52:27,734 --> 00:52:29,233
with the pageant
queen over here.

939
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:30,900
- Yes you are.
- Would you mind?

940
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,033
Come on, Ford.

941
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,166
Get it on this.

942
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,066
Me?

943
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,333
No.
Get lower, get lower.

944
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:37,747
Get lower. Got
you, get in there.

945
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,100
Come on, get in there.

946
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:40,600
Get in there.

947
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:43,667
It's only for Shirley, okay?

948
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,967
For Shirley.

949
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,433
Hey Shirley.

950
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,333
Oh my God, okay. God,
please, don't bite the watch.

951
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:56,100
Don't much on the
watch. Bad, bad goat.

952
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:57,367
My God, my dad gave me this

953
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,940
as a graduation gift
from law school.

954
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,500
Come on.

955
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:02,834
Have a great time, kids.

956
00:53:02,967 --> 00:53:04,500
Yep.

957
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:07,000
You, um, you went to law school?

958
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Yeah, yeah I've
done a lot of things,

959
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:15,000
but I'm here now and
I like it, so yeah.

960
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:20,567
Come on, let's take a little
walk on the beach, huh?

961
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,700
Hm?

962
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:26,767
What a perfect day.

963
00:53:29,066 --> 00:53:30,266
I used to take walks like this

964
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,667
on my grandpa's crawfish farm.

965
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,600
You know if there's
anything I regret,

966
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:38,633
it's not going home more often.

967
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,734
I have to admit, I enjoyed
not having my phone today.

968
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:44,867
Thank you.

969
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,300
It was liberating and I feel
like I got to know you more.

970
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:56,000
So tell me, your
perfect island life,

971
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:59,700
do you ever see
anything more or?

972
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,700
Well, the thing is,
if you had asked me that

973
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:05,567
when I first got here,

974
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,767
the answer would've
been a hard no.

975
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:10,633
But now...

976
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:20,533
Hey Ford.

977
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,900
Another tourist drove a
golf cart into the pond.

978
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:26,166
You gotta come and fish it out.

979
00:54:27,633 --> 00:54:29,600
Yeah, yeah. Okay,
I'll be right there.

980
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:35,133
Duty calls.

981
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Be back in a few hours.

982
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:05,800
Hey.

983
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:06,967
What is going on?

984
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,800
The one at the New
Jersey DA's office?

985
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:15,400
The one that you referred to

986
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:17,300
in the interview with
the Congresswoman?

987
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:19,166
I remember the
broad strokes. Why?

988
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,333
Well you were right.

989
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:23,000
He is familiar.

990
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,033
I'm about to send you a photo.

991
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:27,467
Seriously?

992
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,867
This is happening?

993
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,834
Tabitha put me on
a leave of absence.

994
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:32,734
Oh, I wouldn't do this
if I didn't have to,

995
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:36,834
but you, my dear, are in
the middle of a story.

996
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:38,700
Come again?

997
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:39,834
I'm not kidding.

998
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:41,400
Ha ha.

999
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,033
What? What is this
I'm looking at?

1000
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,834
The guy standing behind
former DA George Clayton?

1001
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:53,033
In the middle, with the beard?

1002
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,100
ADA Malcolm Elliot, Jr.

1003
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,867
This is a huge story.

1004
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,066
He tried the case and
it was a slam dunk

1005
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,967
that ended in a mistrial.

1006
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,734
It never got retried
and he's the only one

1007
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:10,934
whose side of the scandal
has never been heard.

1008
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:12,867
He literally disappeared.

1009
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,367
All right, well, my
guy's name is Ford.

1010
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,133
People have doppelgangers.

1011
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:22,266
It just really looks like him.

1012
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,867
He took the fall
for the mistrial.

1013
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,433
Some people say he was bribed.

1014
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:33,367
No wonder he's hiding
out on a tiny island.

1015
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,633
Okay, we don't know
that this is Ford.

1016
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:39,734
But we need verification, stat.

1017
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:40,867
Well, it gets worse.

1018
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,467
Rumor has it Clayton,
Malcolm Elliot's old boss,

1019
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,967
is about to announce he's
running for governor.

1020
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,700
Great.

1021
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,900
Thanks for tasting this with me.

1022
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:58,133
I'm gonna pitch it my folks
as a new appetizer menu item.

1023
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I need a second opinion.

1024
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,166
Of course my friend,

1025
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:05,300
I will take free, delicious
snacks anytime, any day.

1026
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:08,333
So, you and Jade. Talk to me.

1027
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:13,633
I was watching you
both last night, and?

1028
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,633
And now you just spent
the day together.

1029
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,734
Ford, and she's a news
producer from New York.

1030
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:25,333
Look, I know, man.

1031
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:26,467
I just...

1032
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,133
I like her.

1033
00:57:30,266 --> 00:57:31,266
I can't help it.

1034
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,700
It's a bit risky, in
my opinion, for a fling.

1035
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:44,000
You know, I really
wish it was just a fling.

1036
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You know, a fling, it's
light, it's breezy.

1037
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,300
She is far too
complicated for a fling.

1038
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,967
Well, if you wanna
start something new,

1039
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,066
you're gonna have to
tell her the truth.

1040
00:57:56,266 --> 00:57:57,800
I'm working on it, okay?

1041
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:06,266
Okay.

1042
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:10,200
Okay, okay, okay,
man, that is good.

1043
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:13,100
Your dad is gonna love this.

1044
00:58:31,834 --> 00:58:32,834
M. Ford?

1045
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,467
What am I doing?

1046
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,934
Malcolm Elliot Jr.
And Brooke Davis.

1047
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:08,266
Son of Malcolm Elliot,
Sr. and Allison Ford.

1048
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,266
"Great day, went to bed.

1049
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:40,166
See you tomorrow."

1050
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,266
Hey, ready to go?

1051
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:28,367
Uh, I'm sorry. Wait, go where?

1052
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,600
Waterside picnic.

1053
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:33,233
Uh, private island.

1054
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,000
I got some hookups.

1055
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,233
Thought you might
enjoy the scenery and,

1056
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,367
you know, a boat ride.

1057
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:42,533
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

1058
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,800
I'll just be a minute.

1059
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,200
What's up? You're usually
a bit more talkative.

1060
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,367
Just thinking.

1061
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:02,367
About what?

1062
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,166
Now who's the one
doing the interviewing?

1063
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:11,600
Just thinking about the
fact that I'm leaving soon.

1064
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,533
Not sure that I want to.

1065
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,667
Are you serious?

1066
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,320
You're not itching
to get back to work?

1067
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,600
Honestly, no.

1068
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,333
But you can't hide from
real life forever, right?

1069
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:30,900
I'll see you downstairs in 10?

1070
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:55,166
This has got to be

1071
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,400
the most beautiful
place I've ever seen.

1072
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:00,367
Oh, it's gonna get better.

1073
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,367
Just come.

1074
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,133
Better?

1075
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:03,033
Mm-hm.

1076
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,233
Yeah, just follow me.

1077
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,266
Wow, you were not lying

1078
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,200
when you said you
had the hookup.

1079
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,400
And rosé.

1080
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
It's your favorite.

1081
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:24,767
My favorite.

1082
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:31,767
Ford...

1083
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:37,333
There's a lot of reasons I
don't wanna go back to New York.

1084
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,667
I need to tell you something.

1085
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,900
I know.

1086
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:45,567
I have feelings for you, too.

1087
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:53,300
Look, there's something
I have to tell you, too.

1088
01:02:53,433 --> 01:02:55,300
But I need to know
that I can trust you.

1089
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:56,133
Seriously?

1090
01:02:56,266 --> 01:02:57,934
Come on, you're a news producer

1091
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,400
who told me that she puts
her job before relationships.

1092
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:02,867
Oh, that.

1093
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,867
Mm-hm.

1094
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,467
Fair enough.

1095
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Look, um...

1096
01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:11,667
I was a version of you.

1097
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:16,834
Very passionate about my
job, worked long hours,

1098
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:20,867
but I, um...

1099
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,166
I trusted my mentor and
everything came crashing down.

1100
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:31,633
Ford.

1101
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,100
I know.

1102
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,166
It's okay.

1103
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,500
Wait, what do you mean you know?

1104
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:45,033
It's nice to meet
you, Malcolm Elliot, Jr.

1105
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:50,567
You knew?

1106
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:55,867
What, you come down here
looking for me? Like?

1107
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
What? No.

1108
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:01,500
No, no, I sent some vacation
photos to my coworkers.

1109
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,400
One of 'em recognized you-

1110
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:05,900
Your coworkers who
are news producers?

1111
01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:07,367
Right.
Ford, hey.

1112
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Hey, it's me.

1113
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,433
Look, so what, you didn't
have them check up on me?

1114
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,667
Hm?

1115
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,040
You mean to tell me you weren't
snooping around about me?

1116
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:27,600
Wow, this is exactly
what I was afraid of.

1117
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:32,133
Wait, so you're not
gonna talk anymore? What?

1118
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:36,734
I actually thought
that I could trust you.

1119
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,573
I need to get back to the shop.

1120
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,400
This, this was a mistake.

1121
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,734
You were so secretive.

1122
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,600
And I, I thought for a minute

1123
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:37,633
that I recognized you, but I...

1124
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,500
George Clayton, district
attorney of New Jersey,

1125
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,667
my mentor, my friend,
he took a bribe.

1126
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:54,500
He leaked information
that led to a mistrial

1127
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:55,900
in a money laundering case.

1128
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,710
I had no idea it was
him until he told me

1129
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:00,834
I couldn't retry the case.

1130
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:02,433
Pieced a few things together

1131
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:06,100
and the bad guys walked.

1132
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:10,467
The whole thing looked
shady and it was my case.

1133
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,567
I lost faith in institutions
and people that I believed in,

1134
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,767
including my fiance who walked

1135
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,433
the second things got ugly.

1136
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,843
I mean, she barely even wanted
to hear my side of the story,

1137
01:06:22,867 --> 01:06:25,800
much less stick around and
bear with me through it.

1138
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,033
You can't just pretend

1139
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,867
that a part of your
life never happened.

1140
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,867
Why not finally tell your story?

1141
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I can help you.

1142
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,867
You're asking me for an
interview just like that?

1143
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,433
Just off the bat?

1144
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:48,800
What if my life gets blown
up for a second time?

1145
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:50,834
No, I...

1146
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:52,734
No.

1147
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:54,867
I'm not saying that
you have to do it.

1148
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,500
I'm just saying that.
I think you should.

1149
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:01,934
I mean, at least
just think about it,

1150
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:05,767
because what are you, what
are you really doing here?

1151
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,033
Are you living or are
you just hiding out?

1152
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,967
Ford, not all stories and
the way you imagine it.

1153
01:07:14,233 --> 01:07:15,233
I...

1154
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,900
I can't do this right now, okay?

1155
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:22,333
I'm gonna spend the
night at Hughes's house.

1156
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,000
What's going on with Ford?

1157
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:47,133
I know he stayed with
Hughes last night.

1158
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:52,800
I found out by
accident about his past.

1159
01:07:56,867 --> 01:07:59,033
I had to tell him
that I knew and then

1160
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:06,367
when we talked, I think I
just, I pushed him too far.

1161
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:13,900
I should have just left
it or listened.

1162
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:15,967
Are you telling
me this as someone

1163
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,266
who wants to be with Ford?

1164
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,734
Or are you telling me
this as a news producer

1165
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:23,066
who wants her story?

1166
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,233
Both, I guess.

1167
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,900
When I met Ford, I had no
idea who he was, and then...

1168
01:08:38,266 --> 01:08:39,867
Then I started to like him.

1169
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,767
And now...

1170
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And now?

1171
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,133
I was just opening
up to her, you know?

1172
01:09:02,266 --> 01:09:04,133
Finally, just someone,
letting her in.

1173
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,743
And then the next
thing you know,

1174
01:09:07,767 --> 01:09:10,467
she's telling me, she already
knows and I should go public.

1175
01:09:12,934 --> 01:09:14,867
But I don't know if
I'm ready for all that.

1176
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,266
Well I hear you,
but maybe it's time.

1177
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,200
Look, not everyone's
gonna believe me.

1178
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,700
I don't want my life to turn
into a circus all over again.

1179
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:25,176
Sometimes you just
have to face the things

1180
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,767
you don't want to.

1181
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,800
Look who's talking.

1182
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:31,533
It's a completely
different situation.

1183
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,800
Yeah, right.

1184
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:34,309
You have no idea
the pressure I feel.

1185
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,066
And not just my dad,
from the whole island.

1186
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:42,400
What?

1187
01:09:42,533 --> 01:09:43,576
Dude, you're like the mayor.

1188
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,333
The whole island loves
you, man, whatever you do.

1189
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,600
I'm here.

1190
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:57,767
You have
anything you wanna tell me?

1191
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,900
Nothing concrete, still
looking for confirmation.

1192
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,020
So you really
like this guy, then?

1193
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,533
I just need some more time.

1194
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:11,367
This is news, big news,

1195
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,700
and you know if the
situation were reversed,

1196
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,767
you'd be saying the
same thing to me.

1197
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,800
I love you, but I can only
hold off on this for so long.

1198
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:22,367
Look, I gotta go.

1199
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,467
Malcolm Elliot Jr.?

1200
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,600
Good afternoon.

1201
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,233
Afternoon.

1202
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:58,100
We're looking for a gentleman
named Malcolm Elliot Jr.

1203
01:10:58,233 --> 01:11:00,367
By any chance would you know
where we could find him?

1204
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,667
Never heard of him.

1205
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,200
Ah, I believe he goes by the
name of Ford on the island.

1206
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,333
Hm.

1207
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:08,266
Is he a very short man?

1208
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,767
Uh no, no, actually I
think he's pretty tall.

1209
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,467
Does he have a mustache?

1210
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,300
I don't know.

1211
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:15,867
He could.

1212
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,066
Now, is he the one with
the three little dogs?

1213
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,900
I dunno.

1214
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:25,033
Well, I don't know him, then.

1215
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,867
Thanks for your time.

1216
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,033
Come on.

1217
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:36,200
Two nosy men here
looking for Ford.

1218
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,567
Ford here.

1219
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,834
Yeah, Ford. Hibbert.

1220
01:11:51,033 --> 01:11:52,142
I just wanna give
you a heads up.

1221
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,467
How's that?

1222
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,834
Two guys just
arrived on the island.

1223
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:58,233
They were asking around
where to find you.

1224
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:00,166
Some reporter type
and a camera guy.

1225
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,066
Thanks, Hibbert.

1226
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,333
Yeah, no worries.

1227
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,142
So there's a
cameraman and reporter

1228
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:12,066
who just water taxied
in looking for me.

1229
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,734
Wait, what?

1230
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:14,947
What are you talking about?

1231
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,100
You think it just magically
happened out nowhere?

1232
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,433
Ford, where are you going?

1233
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:28,567
Just leave the keys under
the mat before you go.

1234
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:50,066
Courtney, how could you do this?

1235
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,967
You completely blindsided me.

1236
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,900
Hold on.

1237
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,266
What are you talking about?

1238
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,700
A news reporter and a cameraman

1239
01:12:56,834 --> 01:12:58,700
just arrived at the island.

1240
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,200
What?

1241
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:01,166
I can't believe you did this.

1242
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,700
You didn't even warn me.

1243
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:03,967
I didn't, I wouldn't.

1244
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,100
I...

1245
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:06,533
Hold on.

1246
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:07,867
Tabitha?

1247
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,033
Why did a cameraman
and a reporter

1248
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,667
just show up on Jade's vacation?

1249
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,033
Because she's slipping.

1250
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:14,166
Oh, come on.

1251
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:15,667
Are you kidding me?

1252
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,467
Ted was already in
Miami covering a story.

1253
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,600
I sent him and a cameraman
over first thing.

1254
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,042
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

1255
01:13:21,066 --> 01:13:22,276
I can't believe you
were sitting on this.

1256
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,934
But listen, his former boss
is about to run for governor

1257
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:27,166
and no one's heard this
guy's side of the story.

1258
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,934
It was a mistrial and the
case was never retried.

1259
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:31,066
Why?

1260
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,166
That's news. People need
to know what happened.

1261
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,000
We still need the story, Jade.

1262
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:37,934
Well, you'll have to
get it without me.

1263
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:39,066
But...

1264
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,300
Hi.

1265
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,834
Hi.

1266
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,847
I was going to leave
this at the house for Ford,

1267
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:32,333
but I'm not sure when
he's coming back.

1268
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:36,667
So would you mind
giving it to him for me?

1269
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,800
Of course.

1270
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,100
And I'm sorry that
you're leaving.

1271
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,400
Me too.

1272
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:14,767
Janelle.

1273
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,900
Hey.

1274
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:17,967
Hey.

1275
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,533
I just, I just wanted to
say that I know how I am

1276
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,066
and we don't always
see eye to eye

1277
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,300
and I don't come home
often enough, but,

1278
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:34,133
it's times like
these that I'm happy

1279
01:15:34,266 --> 01:15:35,800
to have a sister to talk to.

1280
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:37,000
Is everything okay?

1281
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,400
Yeah, I'm just
coming home for my trip

1282
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:43,700
earlier than I thought.

1283
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,333
Oh, I have so much to tell you.

1284
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,266
I don't even know where
to start.

1285
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,300
What?

1286
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,643
Do you really think?
Se sold you out?

1287
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,500
Dude, a cameraman and a reporter

1288
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:05,266
magically show up on the island.

1289
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,667
You think this is a coincidence?

1290
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,400
Maybe it wasn't intentional.

1291
01:16:09,533 --> 01:16:10,900
Maybe it was.

1292
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,233
This is my life here.

1293
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,443
I've worked really
hard to build it.

1294
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:17,133
You're an attorney who
runs a bike and cart shop.

1295
01:16:17,266 --> 01:16:18,533
And I like it.

1296
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:20,133
In all the years I've known you,

1297
01:16:20,266 --> 01:16:22,266
I've never seen you connect
with someone like this.

1298
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:24,200
You're just gonna let her go?

1299
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:34,033
She left this for you.

1300
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:40,133
Dear Ford,

1301
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:42,233
I'm sorry about
how things ended.

1302
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,166
I didn't arrange it.

1303
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,667
Just know your story is yours
to tell and in your own time.

1304
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,333
I thought you
should know, though,

1305
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:52,133
Clayton is announcing his
run for governor tonight.

1306
01:16:52,266 --> 01:16:55,300
I just wish we could have
had more time together.

1307
01:16:55,433 --> 01:16:56,533
Jade.

1308
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:57,667
Jade left.

1309
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,567
Her job sent a reporter
looking for Ford.

1310
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,333
She said she didn't arrange it.

1311
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:06,800
You don't believe her?

1312
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:11,233
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1313
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:12,433
I believe her.

1314
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:15,934
Then as far as I can see,

1315
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:18,066
you have been given the chance

1316
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,133
to finally set
your path straight

1317
01:17:22,533 --> 01:17:25,400
and have a chance of a future

1318
01:17:25,533 --> 01:17:27,834
with a really lovely woman.

1319
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:29,467
So what are you waiting for?

1320
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,367
And as for you...

1321
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,433
Don't think I don't know
what's going on with you.

1322
01:17:41,567 --> 01:17:46,300
It's time you had a
talk with your father.

1323
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:48,233
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1324
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:52,600
Yes, you do.

1325
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,100
Goodbye.

1326
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,367
Ford?

1327
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,367
Hey, look, I changed my mind.

1328
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:22,467
I'm doing the interview because
it's time, and I want to.

1329
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:25,967
Okay, but I have one condition.

1330
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,600
It has to be with you.

1331
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:33,500
I thought you'd never ask.

1332
01:18:33,633 --> 01:18:35,400
So it's a yes?

1333
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:37,367
It's a yes.

1334
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,867
Are you sure?

1335
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,600
Yes.

1336
01:18:44,734 --> 01:18:45,734
Let's do this.

1337
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,433
"South side of the
island, 21 Zephyr Lane.

1338
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,633
And Jade Taylor
says to step on it."

1339
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:02,934
Thank you. Come on.

1340
01:19:06,934 --> 01:19:09,166
I know everything you
did for me was out of love.

1341
01:19:11,767 --> 01:19:14,600
I remember the day we put the
plaque out on my office door.

1342
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,834
You were so proud.

1343
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:21,400
I was.

1344
01:19:21,533 --> 01:19:23,467
I'm proud of this
restaurant, too.

1345
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
What you've created.

1346
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,900
The history.

1347
01:19:28,367 --> 01:19:29,367
And I love cooking.

1348
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:31,633
I appreciate everything

1349
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,700
you sacrificed for me
more than you know,

1350
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:38,533
but I don't want you
to sell this place.

1351
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:42,133
I wanna take it over.

1352
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,600
Can you still be a
notary at the weekend?

1353
01:19:57,767 --> 01:19:58,767
Thanks, dad.

1354
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:04,467
Yes, yes, Courtney.
I've got him.

1355
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,633
He's ready.

1356
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:07,667
Are you sure?

1357
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:10,133
Very sure.

1358
01:20:13,533 --> 01:20:14,600
Okay, Jade.

1359
01:20:14,734 --> 01:20:16,700
Knock 'em out in three...

1360
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:24,767
Thank you for sitting down
with me today, Mr. Elliot.

1361
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,467
It's Malcolm, please.

1362
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,767
I just wanna set
the record straight.

1363
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,333
Four years ago, you
were the lead attorney

1364
01:20:31,467 --> 01:20:33,834
on the McAllister
money laundering case,

1365
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,567
a case with clear cut evidence

1366
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,934
and yet it ended in a mistrial.

1367
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:42,133
Please, tell us your
side of the story.

1368
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,433
My friend, my mentor,
DA George Clayton,

1369
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:50,300
the man who was going
to officiate my wedding,

1370
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:52,900
suddenly wouldn't allow
me to retry the case.

1371
01:20:53,033 --> 01:20:54,734
I held my tongue.

1372
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:55,867
I was stuck.

1373
01:20:56,567 --> 01:20:59,133
And why did you decide
to come forward now?

1374
01:20:59,266 --> 01:21:02,200
Is it because you heard
that your former boss,

1375
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:03,500
George Clayton, has announced

1376
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:05,166
that he's running for governor?

1377
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,433
No, I had no idea he was
running until just now.

1378
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:09,406
Why am I taking this interview?

1379
01:21:09,433 --> 01:21:13,367
Well, when you decide you wanna
move forward with your life,

1380
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,367
that you want to
start a new chapter,

1381
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,980
the best chance of
being successful at that

1382
01:21:18,033 --> 01:21:23,033
is to let go of your past,
and I'm ready to do that.

1383
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:28,433
DA George Clayton took the bribe

1384
01:21:28,567 --> 01:21:31,300
and then he leaked
the documents.

1385
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:34,400
I had no idea until after the
case was declared a mistrial.

1386
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:37,467
The McAllister's walked.

1387
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,266
Malcolm, thank
you for your time.

1388
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:47,066
That is a wrap right there.

1389
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,367
That's a scoop.

1390
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,066

was on vacation.

Yeah.

It's a birthmark, though.

- Hm?

1396
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:06,533
Technically I still have two
weeks of vacation time left.

1397
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:08,967
Hm, that is music to my ears.

1398
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,100

1399
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,133
What happens after that?

1400
01:22:15,367 --> 01:22:17,934
Trip back to Jersey
to visit my family.

1401
01:22:20,266 --> 01:22:21,066
Really?

1402
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,066
Mm-hm.

1403
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,633
Well, if you're interested,

1404
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:28,100
my mother is having a
not turning 60 party.

1405
01:22:28,834 --> 01:22:30,734
You should swing by on your way.

1406
01:22:32,266 --> 01:22:34,146
I just so happen to love
not turning 60 parties.

1407
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,400
You know, I was
thinking after Jersey,

1408
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,209
it's been a while
since I crossed

1409
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,467
the river into the city.

1410
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:45,743
Might be a great
place for me to look

1411
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:47,300
into some pro bono law work.

1412
01:22:48,734 --> 01:22:50,166
Plus, there's this woman.

1413
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,700
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1414
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,133
She actually lives there.

1415
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:58,700
You know, funny story. I
found her sleeping in my house

1416
01:22:58,834 --> 01:23:00,467
on Maceo Island one night.

1417
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,367
She thought it was
a vacation rental.

1418
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,967
Crazy.

1419
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:07,567
