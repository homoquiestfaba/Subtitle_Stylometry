1
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,760
Okay, so our next act,
a very funny man.

2
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,051
Please make him feel welcome.
Jeff Nichols.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Hi. My name is Jeff,

4
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,144
and I'm an alcoholic.

5
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,580
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hi, Jeff.

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,000
I have severe
learning disabilities,

7
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,837
which have plagued me
my whole life.

8
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,991
I've been diagnosed
with ADD, dyslexia,

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,993
and a mild case of
Tourette's Syndrome.

10
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,024
I have trouble balancing,
which doctors have told me

11
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,831
is inner ear related,
but it's not.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,967
It's more associated
with the word "balance"

13
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:54,153
than with balance itself.

14
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,605
The good news is that none
of these problems, however,

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,858
are the result
of my addiction to alcohol.

16
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,821
I've been sober
for almost ten years.

17
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:10,018
I've always wanted
to do good, you know?

18
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,205
Kind of be a hero.

19
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,863
Even on the day
that made me get sober,

20
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,166
I started out with
the best intentions.

21
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:28,303
<i>My mommy had lined up
a job for me.</i>

22
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:32,141
<i>All I had to do was
pass the interview.</i>

23
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,348
Sorry.

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,317
Oh, it's...

25
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,819
Got it.

26
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:46,188
It's...

27
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,373
- Good morning.
- Morning.

28
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,831
I already put the shirt on.
I'm just gonna wear it.

29
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,733
Right. One yellow Oxford.

30
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,202
Yellow?

31
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,237
Yellow? I thought
this was white.

32
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,872
No. It's yellow.

33
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,962
It is. It is yellow.

34
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,214
I don't... Maybe I should
get a white one.

35
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,967
You know, I've got
a big job interview today.

36
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:18,086
It's just that these guys,
they wear traditional
white Oxford shirts.

37
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,399
It's kind of the standard,
you know?

38
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:21,943
I think the yellow
looks nicer on you.

39
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,871
How can you tell if you like it
better if you haven't seen me
in the white?

40
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:29,264
I can tell when your face
is red, so the yellow
tones it down a bit.

41
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,283
It's cute.

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,621
You don't think
it's too yellow, do you?

43
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,738
No.

44
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,124
This is very important,
you know.

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,660
I'm thinking
maybe I should get both.

46
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:43,378
No. I think
I should get white.

47
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,447
Listen, if you want
the white one,
it's right there.

48
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,082
You can just grab it.

49
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:50,002
I don't want to create
a problem for you. I just...

50
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:53,639
I don't know.

51
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,842
I should get a white one.

52
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,977
Can you just tell me
one more time...

53
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,297
Do you like the yellow?

54
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,316
I do. Yes.

55
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,686
Promise?

56
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:08,978
Yes, I promise.

57
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,692
Hey. How are you?

58
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:17,112
Uh, Jeff Nichols.
I'm here for the interview.

59
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:20,115
Just sit down
with the others.

60
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,590
Fuck!

61
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,716
I'll be right back.

62
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,412
Jesus Christ. Relax.

63
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,222
Do you think this shirt
looks good on me?

64
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,340
It looks fine.

65
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,843
It's not too noticeable,
is it?

66
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,113
Why would it be?

67
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,348
Because it's yellow.

68
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,351
No. I didn't even notice.

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,238
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,295
He's right.

71
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,831
Work it to own it
because you're in it
to win it.

72
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,967
Cathy, would you be a doll

73
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,969
and send in
the next interviewee?

74
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,721
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

75
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,341
Would the gentleman
in the yellow shirt
come up here?

76
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,964
<i>Before Mommy found out</i>
<i>about the job interview,</i>

77
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,354
<i>I wanted to make her proud.</i>

78
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,073
Fucking idiot!

79
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,491
I hate you!

80
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,077
<i>I just needed my stuff
on this boat to do it.</i>

81
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,163
You watch!
If I can't land her a job,

82
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,248
I'm going to land her a fish!

83
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,763
<i>The only thing
that makes me feel good,</i>

84
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,071
that lifts me up
and tells me that I'm worthy

85
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,457
is when I catch a fish.

86
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,259
<i>Nothing's like it.</i>

87
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,045
<i>Nothing makes you
feel better.</i>

88
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Mommy! Mommy!

89
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:02,267
What is it, sweetie?
Did you catch one?

90
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,435
Yeah.

91
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,190
Here, let me get it.
Your first fish.

92
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,777
Look at that!
Should we let him go?

93
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,062
- Yeah.
- Okay.

94
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,344
You want to say
goodbye?

95
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,534
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Fish.

96
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,050
Go on.
Go away.

97
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,406
Jeff, I'm so proud of you.

98
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,556
<i>Do you like fishing?</i>
<i>Do you want to fish some more?</i>

99
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,130
<i>- Yeah.
- You're my hero, sweetie.</i>

100
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,249
<i>That was the biggest fish</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

101
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,085
<i>You are really
a great fisherman.</i>

102
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,853
Oh, thank God!

Mother of God!

124
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:39,958
When the Coast Guard gets here,
you tell them you saw a woman,
and she ran that way.

125
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,211
You're cool, guys.
Stay true to yourselves.

126
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,130
What an idiot.

127
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,683
<i>I don't remember
how I got back to the city,</i>

128
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,603
<i>but I know I got mugged.</i>

129
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,475
<i>By some miracle,
I made it home.</i>

130
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:58,109
He doesn't. You're right.

131
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,445
<i>Well, I almost made it home.</i>

132
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,198
Well, as long as it
makes him happy.

133
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,733
Fine with me.

134
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,955
Oh, my God.

135
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,623
Oh, my God!

136
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,086
- Jeff.
- Morning.

137
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,445
Jeff. Oh, sweetie!

138
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,581
- Are you okay?
- Mommy.

139
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,478
Oh, sweetie,
what did you do?

140
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,552
I don't think
I got the job, Mommy.

141
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,754
But you know
what still bugs me?

142
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,256
I submit as a fact that
the single hardest thing

143
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,059
for a person with learning
disabilities like mine to do

144
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,427
is to captain a boat.

145
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:34,657
There's so many things
to take care of.

146
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,465
You got the electrical system,

147
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,317
you got the hull, the lines,

148
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,603
the radio, the paint,
the weather.

149
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,471
It's endless!

150
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,074
I don't want to blame Mike
for letting me use his boat,

151
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,577
but I will say that he didn't
show the best judgment either.

152
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,113
- Then there's my mom,
- You're deflecting, man.

153
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,449
Hey, come on,
no cross talk.

154
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:57,335
Some might call it deflecting,
some might call it fact.

155
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,538
I've identified
the enemy, details.

156
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,759
I'm sorry. If everybody's gonna
get a chance to share tonight,

157
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,795
we need to limit the sharing
to five minutes.

158
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,215
I didn't get to say
what I wanted to say.

159
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,635
What do you want to say?

160
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,053
Isn't it hot in here?

161
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,671
What do you say we vote
to turn down the heat?

162
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,107
Please. Just hurry up,
finish your share.

163
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,120
But I can't with
all this pressure!

164
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,561
Then shut the fuck up!

165
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,529
Hey, come on! No acting out!

166
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,649
Well, then tell this asshole
to shut the fuck up

167
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:30,068
and let somebody else speak!

168
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,354
I am detoxifying here, man!

169
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:40,579
And what he's saying,
he's got me so confused
I think I'm gonna fucking snap!

170
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,800
Thanks for letting me share.

171
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:50,538
Hi. My name is Jeff,
and I'm an alcoholic.

172
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,641
Hi, Jeff.

173
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,404
What I've been
trying to say...

174
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,430
is that I don't want to
blame it on the program.

175
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,549
But I've spent almost a decade

176
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,153
thinking that the most
important thing in my life
is staying sober

177
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:09,274
while everyone else I know has
gone on to do great things
with their lives.

178
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:13,161
And all I do is sneak into
gyms and substitute teach
on the side,

179
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,395
not that I'm bad at it.

180
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,565
I'm actually pretty good.

181
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,285
<i>I just don't find it
fulfilling.</i>

182
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,714
All right!
Fuck geography!

183
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,250
Let's play Simon says!
Simon says do this!

184
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,187
I... love... school!

185
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,140
Books... are... good!

186
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:44,693
Reading... is... good!

187
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,563
You! You, you're out,
you're out. Seriously.

188
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,287
I'm...

189
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:01,292
I'm alone all the time.

190
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,212
It hurts to feel lonely.

191
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,781
And I'm ashamed to admit it,

192
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,528
but I've been avoiding
calling Lenny,

193
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,619
the guy I'm mentoring
for over a week now.

194
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,172
I think at the Serene Horizon
meeting on Thursday

195
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:17,475
I'm just going to have
to cut Lenny loose.

196
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,795
I know I should be trying
to help him for my benefit
as well as his,

197
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:25,466
but I just don't have
the strength right now.

198
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,736
You see,
my Tourette's Syndrome

199
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:32,323
has been creating
a real shit-storm lately.

200
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,810
<i>For hours during the night,
I've involuntarily been playing</i>

201
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,197
<i>a game of fantasy basketball
in my head.</i>

202
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,628
This ain't no game, man!

203
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:57,632
That's a foul!

204
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,551
I love you, Jeff!

205
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,774
Pushing!

206
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,442
What?

207
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,977
<i>It's debilitating.</i>

208
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:11,646
What? That's not a foul!

209
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:13,732
I'll show you a foul!

210
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,467
I'll fuckin' kill you, Ref!

211
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,702
Hoo! You're out of here!

212
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,405
Oh, my God!
They're clearing the benches!

213
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:27,462
Motherfucker, I told you
to quit clapping!

214
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,715
Sorry. I'll turn
the TV down.

215
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,925
<i>Since I was very young,</i>

216
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,511
<i>I've always had
the same dream.</i>

217
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,600
<i>Jeff? Jeff?</i>

218
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,384
<i>Yes, you.</i>

219
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:54,739
<i>Your job is to put
the red balls in the red bin</i>

220
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,243
<i>and to put the yellow balls
in the yellow bin</i>

221
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,946
<i>and to put the blue balls
in the blue bin.</i>

222
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,248
<i>Got it?</i>

223
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,333
- Yup.
- <i>Good.</i>

224
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,347
<i>Yay, Jeff!</i>

225
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,049
<i>Good!</i>

226
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,054
<i>Good job, sweetie!</i>

227
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,524
<i>You are so good at this!</i>

228
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,476
<i>It's a simple dream.</i>

229
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,945
<i>And all the details go away.</i>

230
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,897
<i>It comforts me.</i>

231
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,732
Thanks for letting me share.

232
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,652
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Thanks, Jeff.

233
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,381
That was
a great share, Jeff.

234
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,456
So your message is
just to keep it simple?

235
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,492
Yeah.

236
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:51,496
What did you think of the famous
Serene Horizon meeting?
Did you share?

237
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:54,644
Yeah, I shared.
Jeff, weren't you
listening?

238
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,786
Yeah, I was.
How you doing, man?

239
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,733
Well, it's been tough
this past two weeks,

240
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,675
not drinking and losing
my job over at Con-Ed

241
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:04,937
'cause I really
loved that.

242
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,823
It's the only thing
I cared about.

243
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,930
And I'm lonely.

244
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,350
I'm so lonely.
I haven't touched a woman
in three months.

245
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:16,938
Well, I got a message for you...
Masturbation helps.

246
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,837
- I need another meeting.
- That's a good idea.

247
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,643
Why don't you call me
if you have any problems?

248
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,912
Your phone's disconnected.

249
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,331
It'll be connected soon.
I promise.

250
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,368
Why don't I just
give you my address
and you come over sometime?

251
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,955
I think that'll be best.
I live in an SRO.
It's really crowded.

252
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,685
As a matter of fact
they let me have a roommate,
it's so crowded.

253
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,969
He moved out
'cause of my drinking.

254
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,127
Lenny, why don't I
call you, okay?

255
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:42,046
I'm really in a state
right now, okay?

256
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,799
I told you, man.
I've been in ten years,

257
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:50,471
but I'm really not qualified
to help you, okay?

258
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,943
Here. Just write it down.

259
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,527
Great.

260
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,380
I think it'd be great
if you come over sometime.

261
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,787
Take care, man.

262
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,582
- Don't drink.
- All right.

263
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:11,960
Hi. Excuse me.

264
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,046
Hi. I'm sorry that
I forgot the donuts.

265
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,881
Oh, no, that wasn't...

266
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,969
No, I just... I actually wanted
to ask you a question.

267
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,038
Maybe we can talk about it
over coffee.

268
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,018
Well, I've had about
six cups already,

269
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,120
but if you want
to grab another one...

270
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:31,846
You know, I don't
really like coffee.

271
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:34,515
Why don't we just
go to my place?

272
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,941
Sure.

273
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,496
Oh, Jeff. Oh, yeah.

274
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,034
Yep.

275
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:55,921
Thanks.

276
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,542
Okay.

277
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,964
- Do you want one?
- No.

278
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,699
Lynn Brody.

279
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:28,536
I thought you said
your name was Ferguson.

280
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,821
It is Ferguson.

281
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,540
My fiancé's last name
is Brody.

282
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:37,045
Fiancé?
Should I be worried?

283
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,129
No.

284
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,964
No. He's in Dubai.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
He's gone three weeks
out of the month
on business.

286
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,169
This is his apartment.

287
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,108
It's very neat.
Almost intimidating.

288
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,761
That's Terry.
He's very particular.

289
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,275
I wasn't doing so well
when I first met him.

290
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:01,169
So if I can go for two years
without acting out,
he'll marry me.

291
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,898
I don't have to work
or anything.

292
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,940
I just have to go to meetings
and try not to screw up.

293
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:08,943
Is this a screw-up?

294
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:13,031
Probably, but I think
I can cover your tracks.

295
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,750
Oh, good.

296
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,202
Why are you marrying him?

297
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:21,756
I don't know.

298
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,209
He takes care of me.
Is that wrong?

299
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,012
No, not at all.

300
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,299
I have a very similar
relationship with my mommy.

301
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:39,724
Since I already
broke one rule,

302
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:42,944
do you mind
if I break another?

303
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,781
Sex? More sex?

304
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,282
Are you ready for that?

305
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:52,353
I could use another hour.

306
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,322
No. It's something else.

307
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,324
- Sure.
- Okay.

308
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,712
Okay, this is really weird.
It's not my passion or anything,

309
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:05,199
but it's just something that I
like to do, and Terry hates it.

310
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,804
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

311
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,067
Ready?

312
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,707
- Yep.
- You sure?

313
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,644
- Yes.
- Okay.

314
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,963

- That was amazing.
- You liked it?

330
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,234
Yeah.

331
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:16,070
I learned it in
my song and dance class.

332
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:19,106
I don't know what to say.
That was amazing.

333
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,409
Terry is the luckiest guy
I've ever heard of.

334
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:23,277
Why wouldn't he like that?

335
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,630
And what the fuck
is he doing in Dubai?

336
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,167
It's not like you're
a pole dancer or anything.

337
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:37,258
Jeff, there's something
I-I should tell you.

338
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:38,843
Okay.

339
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:43,147
But I don't want to.

340
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,816
I just want you to know
that I'm...

341
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,236
bent, not broken.

342
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,272
Broken's cool, too.

343
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,811
I like you.

344
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,813
You're funny.

345
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,815
You should be a comedian.

346
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,395
- Really? You think so?
- Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,119
It's interesting
that you say that

348
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,820
because I've been told by
a certain authority figure

349
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,372
that I have a good
stage presence.

350
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,007
Commanding, even.

351
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,877
My stepdad got me a spot
on the Luggage Channel once.

352
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,213
Did you see it?

353
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:16,464
No.

354
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:20,801
Well, maybe they'll
show a rerun someday.

355
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,720
I'm sure you were great.

356
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:25,890
I mean, I love your shares.

357
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,142
They make me feel better
about myself.

358
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,846
I should go.
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,733
Oh, Jeff, I didn't
mean it like that.

360
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,736
- No!
- That was so insensitive.
I didn't mean that.

361
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,738
No, no, it's okay.

362
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:46,410
I haven't been with a woman
in a long time, and, uh,

363
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:51,532
you're beautiful
and intelligent
and really amazing.

364
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:56,036
And to be perfectly honest,
you're just too good for me.

365
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,373
I can see that.
You will, too, soon, so...

366
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:03,511
I'm just gonna
get my stuff and go.

367
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:05,524
I'm pretty sure
that you're not gonna
wanna see me again.

368
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,732
That's fine.

369
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,969
If you don't want me to go
to the Serene Horizon meeting,
that's okay.

370
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,339
- 'Cause there are plenty of
meetings for me to go to.
- Jeff...

371
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,242
- Don't worry.
- Oh, my God.

372
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,212
What?

373
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,158
W-What is...
Is that blood?

374
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:26,050
Are you bleeding?

375
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,956
Uh-oh.

376
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,058
That's not...

377
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,179
I-I have no idea
what that is.

378
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,350
Ohh...

379
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,475
It could be yours.

380
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:02,203
I'll leave my number
in the kitchen.

381
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,210
Damn it.

382
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:18,252
I don't know what to say.
I... I was so nervous.

383
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,554
Drank a lot coffee.

384
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,122
And she was on top.

385
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:28,479
Yeah, I guess it's pretty funny
that I squirted in her bed.

386
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,828
That is, until you realize
this was the first girl
that I've kissed

387
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,353
in three years.

388
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:44,362
When she said
"bent not broken,"

389
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:47,281
it felt so good
to hear that.

390
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,586
That was the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

391
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:59,326
Well, I had to get
that off my chest.

392
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,178
Thanks for
letting me share.

393
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,464
Thanks, Jeff.

394
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,143
Samy, what's going on?

395
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:17,361
You're out!

396
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,513
I told you no clap!
You continue to clap!

397
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,566
- What are you talking about?
- You clap all night long!

398
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,518
Hah hah hah hah hah!

399
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,570
The neighbors complain.
I can't take it anymore!

400
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:29,218
This is illegal.
You gotta give me
an eviction notice.

401
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,876
- I give you three!
- Well, I haven't received one.

402
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,995
Here. Look.

403
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,164
What?

404
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,647
Well, they were
hidden in the menus.

405
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,672
I don't care.
You're out. Right now.

406
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,180
Whoa.

407
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,149
You did a nice job
of organizing that.

408
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,434
Huh?

409
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:58,385
I said you did a nice job
of organizing that.

410
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:03,524
The way you
separated the trash bags
and hung your bike helmet,

411
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,109
it's impressive.

412
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,418
Do I know you from
the shelter on 151st?

413
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,337
No.

414
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,590
I'm sorry. I'm not homeless.
I'm just moving.

415
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,043
Me, too, bub.

416
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,629
Have a taste.

417
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,047
Nah. I don't drink.

418
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:28,632
That's cool.

419
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:31,135
Just moving. Good one.

420
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,609
Hey, Lenny,
I'm borrowing your soap.

421
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,456
When you're done,
rinse it off.

422
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,397
I don't want any
ball hairs on it!

423
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,737
Hey!

424
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:52,122
- Hey.
- Hey, hey!

425
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,058
Thanks for
letting me stay here.

426
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,377
Sure. Come on in.

427
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,295
All right.

428
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,030
Whoa.

429
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,298
I get the top bunk bed,
right?

430
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,666
Top bunk's yours.

431
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,171
You know, I, uh...

432
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,541
I never really kissed a girl
until I was 25.

433
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,610
Oh. Really?

434
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:17,181
I mean, I had sex
before that with a girl
in a massage parlor.

435
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,518
But I'd never kissed a girl.

436
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,686
It was kind of weird,
you know.

437
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,772
I used to think
I was gay.

438
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:28,075
Oh. There was a time
when everyone thought
that I was gay.

439
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,660
Really?

440
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,646
Yeah. It was right around
when my mommy married Mike.

441
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,582
Mommy?

442
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,112
He worked in the city,
so we'd stay in his apartment
during the week,

443
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:42,790
and then at his house
on the weekends
in Westchester.

444
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:46,010
The change scared me.

445
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:50,130
So Mike bought me
a giant stuffed puma
to make me feel better.

446
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:57,354
Oh, look.
He just loves
that puma.

447
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,024
Wow! He's so big...

448
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,026
and lifelike.

449
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:07,231
I-I named it after a girl
I had a crush on.

450
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,483
Her name was Scotty.

451
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:13,287
Okay, Scotty, we're gonna play
a little game called "I win".

452
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,494
Gotcha!

453
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:26,199
Scotty, are you okay?
Scotty?

454
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,367
I'm just kidding.

455
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,720
I would never hurt you.

456
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,204
Got you again!

457
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:39,096
That puma was my best friend.
He was my only friend.

458
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,883
So I guess my mommy
thought I was a little weird

459
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:46,570
that I was spending
so much time with a puma.

460
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,239
Jeff?

461
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,691
Where are you, sweetie?

462
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:55,496
Jeff?

463
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,833
Jeff?

464
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,372
Jeff, are you in there,
sweetie?

465
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:24,758
Scotty.

466
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:28,395
There's nothing wrong with what
happened between you and Scotty.

467
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,764
It's okay.

468
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:33,767
It's okay to be gay.

469
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:38,238
But, Mommy, I'm not gay.
Scotty's a girl.

470
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:40,440
But Scotty's a boy's name.

471
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,637
No.

472
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,293
She's a girl.

473
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,462
Okay, whatever you say, sweetie,

474
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:51,669
but I think it's best if
Scotty goes to puma heaven.

475
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:55,222
Why, Mommy? I mean,
Scotty's my only friend.

476
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,652
Sweetie,
if Scotty were your friend,

477
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,737
you wouldn't stick
your penis inside of him.

478
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,294
Please! Mommy!

479
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,430
- It's not true!
- Sweetie, I'm sorry.

480
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:08,318
She's my friend!
She's a girl!

481
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,915
Here, just give me
the puma, sweetie.

482
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,857
- I wouldn't do that to her.
- There you go.

483
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,810
- It's okay, sweetie.
- Okay, Scotty, let's go.

484
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,830
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay. I'm sorry.

485
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,782
It's okay.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

486
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:26,820
The saddest thing is that
now that my-my confidence

487
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,790
is so severely crippled because
of my learning disabilities,

488
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:34,178
and my balls are sagging so low
that I tuck them into my sock,

489
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,274
I look back at the whole thing,
I just wish to hell

490
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,682
that I'd fucked the shit
out of that puma, you know?

491
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,768
Gay or straight.
I don't give a shit.

492
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,722
You know what I mean?

493
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:49,476
That's the fuckin' weirdest
story I've ever heard.

494
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:52,891
But it makes me feel better
because nothing like that
ever happened to me.

495
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:56,349
Yeah, well, I'm glad
I could help.

496
00:28:56,368 --> 00:29:00,888
Is that like a furry tail
I see sticking out
from the bed?

497
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:02,539
You got a puma up there?

498
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,523
Fuck you, man.

499
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,626
You're funny, Jeff.

500
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,962
You're funny.

501
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,665
<i>The walk of shame.</i>

502
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,218
<i>Headed home from a meeting
on a Friday night.</i>

503
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,703
<i>College girls, bars,</i>

504
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:20,474
<i>all the booze in the world
and not a drop to drink.</i>

505
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,810
- How's your coffee?
- Good.

506
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:28,232
I put some cinnamon in it
to make it less bitter.

507
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,933
Do you mix it in?

508
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,819
No. It's just on top.

509
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,688
I recently switched back
from skim to whole.

510
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:37,274
There's really no comparison
between the two.

511
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,742
What about the calories?

512
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:42,496
Fuck those calories.
I use a lot of sugar anyway.

513
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,998
You are a madman, Jeff.

514
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,867
Yeah.

515
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:54,842
Whoa. Lenny.

516
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,543
You want to go in?

517
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:58,378
It's a bar.

518
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,413
It's a comedy club.
Open mic night.

519
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,778
- They serve drinks
in there, Jeff.
- Yeah, I know.

520
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:06,331
I shouldn't go into a place
where they serve alcohol.
You know what they say.

521
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,284
If you're gonna hang out
in a barbershop, you're
bound to get a haircut.

522
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:14,695
Besides I thought
stand-up comedy was
like the new karaoke.

523
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,029
You ever do karaoke?

524
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,899
Yeah, all the time
when I was fucked up.

525
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:22,536
Oh, man. I can't
do karaoke anymore.

526
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,466
I hadn't even
considered that.

527
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,585
That's gonna be
a tough one to give up.
That's gonna suck.

528
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,795
I used to love
to get hammered and
just sing my heart out.

529
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,780
I'd even start
bawling, man.

530
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,083
It was fuckin'
beautiful.

531
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,954
How the hell am I supposed
to break into comedy?

532
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,340
I don't know.
Get a comedy how-to book.

533
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,676
They gotta have 'em.

534
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:50,630
Lenny, I'd don't know
if I told you this,
but I have dyslexia, okay?

535
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,850
I can barely read.

536
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,330
Speaking of which, did you
go the library reading
I told you about?

537
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,998
Yeah, and guess
who I saw there.

538
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,438
Lynn?

539
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:01,074
Suck, suck, suck, suck!

540
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,862
Suck, suck, suck, suck!
Suck, suck, suck, suck!

541
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:10,117
I got to get to
another meeting.

542
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,955
Don't drink!

543
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:21,929
Lynn's comment about being
a comedian really hit home.

544
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:26,099
I've got good stage presence.
Some say commanding.

545
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,936
And the next big question is...

546
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:33,023
should I let this thing
with Lynn go?

547
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,975
I wish you guys would tell me.

548
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,062
If I shit in your bed,
would you give me
a second chance?

549
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,109
Stick to pumas.

550
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:48,739
Scotty was a girl puma.

551
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,958
She was my friend.

552
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,544
That's not funny.

553
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,714
You sure you said
you'd bring her
to the 3:30 meeting?

554
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,501
For the 50th time, yeah.

555
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:05,150
You know, this sobriety thing
is starting to work.

556
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,974
I think I got a job.

557
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,926
That's great.
That's really great.

558
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:11,094
Listen, do you think
I'll look smart

559
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,545
if she sees me with this?

560
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,597
Absolutely.

561
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,048
One regular coffee.

562
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:19,186
One super mocha choco-latte
with extra whipped.

563
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:20,687
That looks good.

564
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,033
It's a little special treat
I'm giving myself

565
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:25,575
for cracking my first book
in like ten years.

566
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,695
Mm! Wow!
That's piping hot, too.

567
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,930
You got it
all over your face.

568
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,749
Wow.

569
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:36,954
Missed some.

570
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:39,006
Thanks.

571
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,041
Okay. I'm gonna
strike a pose, okay?

572
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:45,178
You just keep your eye out
for her. Just cough or
something when you see her.

573
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,930
All right.

574
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:05,532
Ohh! Ohh!

575
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,067
Ohhhh!

576
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,075
- Jeff!
- A rag, please.

577
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,078
- What's going on?
- Here.

578
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:19,663
Jeff.

579
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:20,881
Hi, Lenny.

580
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,833
Oh, hi.

581
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,971
- Pour that in your lap.
- Okay.

582
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,808
Ah. That feels good.
Yeah, that feels good,

583
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:35,178
You know, I tried calling you,
but your phone got shut off.

584
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,608
Yeah. I tried to get
in touch with you, too.

585
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,099
If you need new sheets...

586
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,801
It's all right.

587
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,970
Put those teabags
on the burn.

588
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,605
Okay.

589
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,191
Ooh.

590
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:51,078
That feels good.
It's a good trick.

591
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,790
How did you learn
this stuff?

592
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:54,915
Took a CPR
and home remedy class.

593
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,917
You're gonna be fine.

594
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,986
Ooh.

595
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,923
The burn doesn't really
look that bad at all.

596
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,093
That's...
That's perfect.

597
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,929
You want to get
a cup of coffee?

598
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,664
I don't really like coffee.

599
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:15,168
I wish we could
go back to my place,
but Terry's in town,

600
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,304
He's leaving for Japan
tomorrow, though.

601
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:21,942
Why don't you meet me at
the One-Day-At-A-Time Dance
on Thursday night?

602
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,610
You know where it is,
right?

603
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,195
Yeah.

604
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,780
All right.

605
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,316
Keep those bags pressed gently
for 20 more minutes.

606
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:31,017
Okay.

607
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,203
- Good to see you.

00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,817

Lynn, you gotta
look at this clown.

whatsoever.

I hope you like Eggs Benedict.

648
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,801
I made the Hollandaise sauce
from scratch.

649
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:03,303
I don't know how good it is.

650
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,855
I just learned how to make it
in my cooking class.

651
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,340
It looks great.

652
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,476
I made the plate, too.

How come you're
so good at everything

654
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,029
I don't know.

655
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,014
I always was good
at stuff like that.

656
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:19,236
You know, I used to be
a consultant. I have an MBA.

657
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:21,354
Of course, I'm a CPA, as well.

658
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:25,825
Jesus Christ, you're
intimidating the hell
out of me right now.

659
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,360
Why don't you work?

660
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,379
I don't know.
Fear, I guess.

661
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,831
I wasn't doing that well
when I first got sober.

662
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:35,919
I feel like I'm just keeping it
together right now, you know?

663
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:39,973
Yeah, I hear you.
Holy shit!

664
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:42,175
Whoa, man! Whoa!

665
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,763
I'd sell my balls
for a boat like this.

666
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:47,959
Or any boat,
for that matter.

667
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:50,350
Well, you could probably
sell your car

668
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,552
and get a dinghy.

669
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,387
That's a good point.

670
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:57,073
Aside from the fact
that my car's my mommy's,

671
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:00,527
buying a boat like this
is only half the battle.

672
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:02,061
They're complicated.

673
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,530
I've already sunk one.

674
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:06,783
Oh.

675
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:11,004
I hate to state the obvious,
Lynn, but Terry's a hell
of a lot older than you.

676
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,406
I noticed denture cleaner
in the bathroom.

677
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,958
He's got a bridge.

678
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,210
He's European.

679
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:19,346
- Do you find him attractive?
- I used to.

680
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,465
But it wasn't about
his looks, you know?

681
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:26,970
He makes me feel safe
and taken care of,
which I like.

682
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:30,523
Of course,
he's a little bit uptight,
kind of controlling

683
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,226
and a bit of a workaholic.

684
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:37,280
You know, it's funny
I always pictured myself
with someone more creative,

685
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,865
like a writer.

686
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,402
God, that'd be cool,
right? A writer.

687
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:44,404
I could be his muse.

688
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,125
Well, maybe
you could be my muse.

689
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh, who does this asshole
think he is?

690
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,413
John McEnroe?

691
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,550
So, uh, you find writers
attractive?

692
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,502
Yeah.

693
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,458
I'm pretty sick
of this drive every day.

694
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:08,228
<i>Your first step
is to get organized.</i>

695
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,491
<i>Sloppy thinking leads
to sloppy writing,</i>

696
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:14,300
<i>so what you've got to do</i>
<i>is you've got to get</i>
<i>your head in order.</i>

697
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,304
If you don't do
something impressive,

698
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,084
Lynn's going to
dump your sorry ass.

699
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,242
Keep your filthy tongue
off of her.

700
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,288
Face it. You're
getting kind of old.

701
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:26,591
You're not doing shit
with your life.

702
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,481
Even bums
think you're homeless

703
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,252
That guy was just
making an observation.

704
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,986
Forget about him.

705
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,184
He wouldn't say it if
there wasn't any truth to it.

706
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,990
Look, that's pure speculation.

707
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:41,094
Comedy is karaoke.

708
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,295
Then what about writing?

709
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,515
Writing?

710
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,100
You can barely read.

711
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:51,054
What do you...
What do you suggest I do, huh?

712
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:52,867
Get drunk
and go gambling.

713
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,274
How would I get the money?

714
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,229
Get the ball!
Be a puma!

715
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:01,147
What's wrong with you?

716
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:05,485
Take it!
I don't wanna play anymore!

717
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,986
Where's the ref!

718
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,021
I'll take a hot dog.

719
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,073
Hi, guys.

720
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,462
Get the ball! Get the ball!
Get the ball!

721
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,363
Yum! Hot dogs!

722
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:18,631
I love hot dogs!

723
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,138
Hey, asshole!

724
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,293
What the fuck
are you doing?

725
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,209
So sorry, sorry, sir.

726
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,478
I-It's my Tourette's.

727
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,458
Get the fuck out
of the way, man!

728
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:34,514
Okay.

729
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:35,648
Dick!

730
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,572
Got another red!
It'll be a minute, buddy!

731
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:51,509
- Hi.
- Don't worry about
the doorman.

732
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,584
I told him
you stuffed your toilet.

733
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,287
Lynn, I need your advice.

734
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:00,072
I've been thinking about
becoming a comedian
or a writer.

735
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,553
I don't know which,
and since you're
attracted to both,

736
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:05,345
I could really
use your opinion,

737
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,348
You want to be a writer now?

738
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,017
Like I said,
I'm somewhat on the fence.

739
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,936
Well, have you ever
written anything?

740
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,437
See, that's the thing.

741
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,056
I've been thinking
about becoming a writer

742
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,120
or trying to be
a comedian.

743
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,505
But I don't know.
I don't know.

744
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,195
That's why I'm asking you

745
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,624
because if you think
that I could be a writer,

746
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,626
then I would try
to write something.

747
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,546
If you think
I could be a comedian,
then I would try comedy.

748
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,631
Am I not making
any sense here?

749
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,438
Have you ever tried comedy?

750
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:36,442
Please just choose one.

751
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,556
If you don't think that
I could do either thing,

752
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,975
then I could just be
a substitute teacher,
for the rest of my life,

753
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,193
which I'm good at.

754
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,228
Could you just
please choose one?

755
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,718
You're not
getting the point.

756
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,754
What point?
You haven't said anything.

757
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:50,590
You could be Santa Claus.

758
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:59,994
Did you just say
I could be Santa?

759
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,484
You want my advice?

760
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,353
Yes, please.

761
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:07,574
Why don't you write a joke?

762
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:12,078
That's a good idea.

763
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,664
Thank you.

764
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:19,002
You know,
I've been thinking a lot
about my current situation

765
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:22,455
'cause to look at me,
you wouldn't know it,

766
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,091
but I was actually once
well taken care of.

767
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,294
My mommy and my stepfather
would takes us to fancy places

768
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,597
like the Ritz, the Waldorf,
Four Seasons.

769
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,778
The kind of places where
they have little chocolate
mints on the pillows.

770
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:35,646
Bath salts. I used to eat
those things all the time.

771
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,365
It's probably why I'm here.
I don't know.

772
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:41,190
Nice, clean 3,000 thread-counted
Egyptian cotton sheets.

773
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,610
I used to order
a cheese plate,

774
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,195
massage
and pay-per-view porno.

775
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,647
All three at the same time.

776
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:50,233
I used to call it
the Shiatsu Gouda Love Fest.

777
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,736
Nothing. I got nothing.

778
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:55,633
When I was 12 years old,
I used to play board games

779
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,577
with my Ecuadorian nanny
named Jade.

780
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,294
Oh, man.
This is embarrassing

781
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,363
She'd play a little game called
"Pocket Pool" in my ball sack.

782
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,549
If she won,
I'd give her a foot massage.

783
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,668
She taught me how to drink.
She was 52.

784
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:12,255
It was fun.
You know, we had good times.

785
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,058
Wake up.

786
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,571
Fuck!

787
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:20,730
Now I live in a filthy room
the size of a tiny closet

788
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,265
with a huge man.

789
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:24,245
Some people would call it
a shit box.

790
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,463
Mommy would call it
an armoire.

791
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:27,403
I don't know what that is.

792
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,573
French? Spanish?
I know it's small.

793
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:33,826
That's funny, right?

794
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,590
And it's not even
my apartment.

795
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,341
It belongs to the guy
I'm mentoring,

796
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,249
the only person I'm supposed
to be taking care of.

797
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,901
But you know what?

798
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,554
There's a lot of benefits
to living in a dump like I do.

799
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,790
For example, can anyone here
claim to have tamed a rat?

800
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,715
Hey, does anyone else
want to share?

801
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:00,219
Why? It's perfect!

802
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:01,754
Oh, fuck.

803
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,890
That's another one
of Mike's buildings.

804
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:06,442
We used to live there
during the week.

805
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,112
Yeah, I was the Prince
of Park Avenue then.

806
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,697
Wow.

807
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,677
You want to
go inside?

808
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:15,318
Not allowed.
Had a problem with the tub.

809
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:20,873
Okay. Why don't you
show me something
that's special to you?

810
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,712
Want me to show you
how to sneak into a gym?

811
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:26,779
Yeah.

812
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,248
All right.
You're awesome.

813
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,171
Watch this.

814
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:36,756

Whoa!

819
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:05,268
Just kidding.

820
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,504
I think I'm in love with you.

821
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,790
Aww...

822
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:14,594
Shoot. I just remembered.
I have to go home.

823
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,796
Terry's corning into town
tonight.

824
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:19,665
I forgot.

825
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:22,468
Oh, yeah.
Do you mind if I walk you?

826
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:25,221
Yeah, okay.

827
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:26,273
Great.

828
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,782
So I'll see you tomorrow
at Kick Starter meeting?

829
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,284
Great.

830
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,819
- Bye.
- Bye.

831
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:53,750
Good afternoon.

832
00:45:53,802 --> 00:45:56,368
- Terry!
- Darling! Here I am.

833
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,920
Home bearing gifts.

834
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,223
Tunisia was not the same
without you.

835
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,374
Wow. I missed you so much.

836
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:05,011
Guess who was on a camel.

837
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:11,550
Jeff!

838
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,552
Jeff.

839
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:14,654
It's Brian.

840
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,721
Oh, hey, Brian.

841
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,941
Brian! Hey!
You... Wha...

842
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:21,444
We went to boarding school
together, honey.

843
00:46:21,496 --> 00:46:26,532
This is Daphne, my wife,
and that's my daughter Lily.

844
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,751
How are you doing, man?

845
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,264
- Really good.
- Great.

846
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,456
Yeah, yeah. Hey, Brian,
I hate to ask,

847
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:35,708
but do got a buck or two
I could borrow,

848
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:37,605
or a swipe
of a Metro Card.

849
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:40,797
Anything works for me.

850
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,687
Sure. Uh...

851
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,808
Thanks.

852
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,026
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

853
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:29,896
♪

854
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:37,970
What?

855
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,229
Nothing.

856
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,443
What?

857
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:51,667
You don't think
I was being honest.

858
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,590
I wasn't even
thinking about you.

859
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,926
I was thinking about myself.

860
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:22,732
When I first quit consulting,
I met some older men,

861
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:25,968
wealthy men who'd
take me out on dates.

862
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:30,506
They were just dates, you know,
dinners and things like that.

863
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:35,878
But then after a while,
they started offering me money.

864
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:39,682
First, I said no,
but then...

865
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,617
I figured why not?

866
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:44,637
I was drinking
and doing a lot of coke.

867
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,757
It just made sense and seemed
like a waste if I didn't.

868
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,493
It wasn't actually even
all that bad.

869
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:54,063
Sometimes it was...
kind of nice.

870
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,736
But then one night,
I was really... I was drunk.

871
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:05,724
And I was pretty far
uptown and...

872
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:10,562
I didn't have any cab fare,

873
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:16,185
so I saw this
nice-looking college kid
and propositioned him.

874
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,071
He took me back
to his parents' apartment,

875
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:24,560
and when we got there,
he didn't want me
to come inside.

876
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:32,468
I still needed the cab fare,
so I got him off in the hallway.

877
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,036
I blew him.

878
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:37,206
And when it was over,
he paid me and...

879
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:44,113
I thought I'd just sit down
and sober up a little bit.

880
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,083
I passed out.

881
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:53,956
When I woke up,
I didn't know where I was.

882
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:58,077
My pants were soaked,
so I knew I wet myself.

883
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,833
The hallway was
completely empty,

884
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:06,836
and I couldn't
find my way out.

885
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:10,039
I was lost and alone,
and it was...

886
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:15,177
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

887
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:18,514
I get lost
all the time.

888
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:20,900
It's very scary.

889
00:50:23,304 --> 00:50:25,955
Jeff, I really like you.

890
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:33,662
But I can't leave Terry.

891
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,947
It's okay.

892
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:40,619
I'm grateful that I've got
someone in my life right now.

893
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:42,171
And unlike before,

894
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,134
I think a lot of the reason
why it works

895
00:50:44,158 --> 00:50:48,711
is because
we're on equal terms,

896
00:50:48,763 --> 00:50:50,296
and he respects that,

897
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,799
and I respect myself.

898
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:56,602
It's all about honesty.

899
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,004
Thanks for letting me share.

900
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,140
Thanks, Lynn.

901
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,061
Mommy, I want to
ask you a favor.

902
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:06,156
Mm-hmm.

903
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,114
I'm considering
a career change.

904
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,282
- Oh, you are?
- Yeah.

905
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,618
I was thinking about
being a stand-up comic.

906
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,548
There's also a chance
for me to write, too.

907
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,957
Jokes at first
and then maybe more.

908
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,836
That's terrific. You know,
I've always told you,

909
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,838
you have a wonderful
stage presence.

910
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:22,890
Commanding.
Really.

911
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:24,130
Come on.

912
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,799
But what made you
want to change?

913
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,803
I met a girl, and I want to
be able to take care of her.

914
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,638
Thank God it's a girl.

915
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,373
Jesus, Mommy!

916
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:37,042
I told you
Scotty was a female puma!

917
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:39,011
Okay.

918
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:43,766
You've only got a couple
months of teaching left
before summer break.

919
00:51:43,818 --> 00:51:47,319
Why don't you just
finish out the year
and see how you feel then?

920
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:52,024
That... That's sensible.
It is very sensible.

921
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:54,610
I hate taking money
from you and Mike,

922
00:51:54,662 --> 00:51:56,996
but, Mommy, there's something
you've got to understand.

923
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,064
I'm like an animal at the zoo.

924
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,000
You just can't release me.

925
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,203
You got to ease me
back into the wild.

926
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:06,956
- Mike, darling.
- I'll get my checkbook.

927
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:10,909
Mike, I swear I'm on
the verge of paying you
back for that yacht.

928
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:12,294
This is just a loan.

929
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:13,941
Plus I'm going to
substitute teach tomorrow.

930
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,080
Something I'm good at.

931
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:17,716
Quiet!

932
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:33,932
Yeah!

933
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,701
All right!

934
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,122
Mrs. Shelby,
the chalk slipped
right out of my hand.

935
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,408
I understand.
It's completely natural.

936
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:47,112
After all, gymnasts use
chalk to powder their hands
because it's slippery.

937
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,715
- This chalk was.
- Clearly.

938
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,118
I don't know if you've been
to a classroom lately,
but it's not easy.

939
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:57,173
I teach mathematics to
our mentally challenged
students once a week.

940
00:52:57,225 --> 00:52:59,175
Exactly.

941
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:01,977
What do you mean,
"exactly"?

942
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:04,897
Well, Mrs. Shelby,
wouldn't you say

943
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,316
that the material you teach
your mentally challenged kids

944
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,236
is far easier than
what I have to teach mine?

945
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,822
I assume you've mastered
third grade mathematics.

946
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,408
Right. Touché.

947
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,161
You know, since you've
been subbing with us,

948
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,998
you've lost control of
the classroom several times,

949
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:28,003
often bribing the children
with both money and candy
to maintain order.

950
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,122
I never used money.

951
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:32,903
A month ago you played
Simon Says for so long
one student fainted.

952
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:36,023
I didn't know he had asthma.
I mean, if he had one of
those little inhaler things

953
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,163
like strung around his neck...

954
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:40,165
Screamed profanities
at the students,

955
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,185
telling one youngster
to, quote,

956
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,888
"Shut your fucking trap."

957
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,339
You're right.

958
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:49,391
That was wrong.
I shouldn't have done that.

959
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:56,031
The larger issue is
you lack presence.

960
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:59,318
And the students?

961
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:02,854
The students,
they have no respect
for you whatsoever.

962
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:08,026
I recommend that you find
a job more suitable
to your abilities.

963
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,890
I got to find
something I can do.

964
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,997
You're funny.

965
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:14,032
That does
a lot of good.

966
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,418
The homeless story,
that did me a lot of good.

967
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,171
Okay. What else?

968
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:21,257
You're a great friend.

969
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:23,342
I'm a funny, great friend.

970
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:26,878
A fucking dog in a sweater
can do that.

971
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:28,480
What about fishing?
You love fishing.

972
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,410
With my LDs,
there's no possible way

973
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,018
I could be the captain
of a fishing boat.

974
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:37,022
Jeff, work on
somebody else's boat.

975
00:54:40,828 --> 00:54:42,894
- Hi.
- Hi.

976
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,424
- How you doing?
- Good.

977
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,032
- Where are your arms?
- Oh, just scratching my back.

978
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:48,834
- Really?
- Got a rash.

979
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,402
- You're not hiding something?
- No. What are you hiding?

980
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,048
You look like you're
sprouting something.

981
00:54:52,072 --> 00:54:53,984
Oh, really?
Like this?

982
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:55,385
- Flowers!
- You like them?

983
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:56,436
How about this?

984
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,211
Jeff, what is this?

985
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:00,912
- It's no big deal.
- No, it is...

986
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,097
I know you can't.

987
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,249
- Oh, my...
- I hope you like it.

988
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:07,353
Oh, my God.
Jeff, it's so beautiful.

989
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,865
- Yeah?
- Yes!

990
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,889
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

991
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:13,925
It's so... Jeff?

992
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:15,427
What's going on?

993
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:19,448
You're scaring me.
Oh, my God. Jeff!

994
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,099
Jeff!

995
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,484
Breathe, breathe.

996
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,537
What's wrong? What?

997
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:28,040
- Get away! Your shoes!
- What's wrong with them?

998
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,520
- Go over there! Please!
- What do you mean?
What's wrong with them?

999
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,461
Take your shoes off.
Throw them over there.

1000
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,998
Oh, my God. Okay.
I'm taking them off.

1001
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,051
Threw 'em away.

1002
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,953
Shh. Try to relax.

1003
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,956
Ohh... Oh, God.

1004
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,559
Just breathe.

1005
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:51,063
God, Jeff. Shh...

1006
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,348
Your shoes.

1007
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,816
What happened?

1008
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,818
Your shoes are New Balance.

1009
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,269
So?

1010
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:01,490
I just...

1011
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:05,494
When I see the word "balance,"
I... I get nauseous,

1012
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:10,532
and I experience vertigo,
and I just lose my balance.

1013
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:13,985
It doesn't happen all the time.
It's only when I'm worked up.

1014
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,337
Oh.

1015
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:19,541
- Oh, God.
- Jeff...

1016
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:23,629
the sneakers don't even say
the word "balance" on them.

1017
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:26,215
The "N" is enough.

1018
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:32,003
I haven't had an episode
like that in a long time.

1019
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,939
I'm okay.

1020
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,557
Thank you.

1021
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,309
Just breathe.

1022
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:40,562
Careful. Careful.

1023
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:43,949
God.

1024
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:46,118
You scared me.

1025
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:51,990
I mean, Jeff, what happens
if your students wear
New Balance sneakers?

1026
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:54,376
I ask them to take them off.

1027
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:58,080
That's so cute.

1028
00:56:58,132 --> 00:57:01,049
Actually, Lynn,
about school...

1029
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,219
I got fired.

1030
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:09,207
Jeff, how can you
afford that necklace?

1031
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,427
See, that's the best thing.

1032
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:14,179
Everything's affordable with
Zeffers' new financing plan.

1033
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:18,434
Jeff, you still have
to pay back the loan.

1034
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:21,069
I hate to admit it,
but I got you, Lynn.

1035
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:24,940
I'm going to be
a commercial fisherman,
an old seadog.

1036
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:28,243
I figured that if this is
a steady thing for me,

1037
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:32,664
maybe you wouldn't have
to get married to Terry.

1038
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,119
I know this sounds crazy,
but I love you.

1039
00:57:37,171 --> 00:57:39,254
I want to take care of you.

1040
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:43,575
I love you, too, Jeff.

1041
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:46,595
You're the best girlfriend
I've ever had.

1042
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,381
The only one, frankly,
but the best.

1043
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:54,136
You know what?
I don't think I've ever had
a real boyfriend either.

1044
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:56,021
Just sugar daddies
and pimps?

1045
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,391
Yeah.

1046
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,565
And she says no
because of the mast-head.

1047
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,640
Hmm.

1048
00:58:09,036 --> 00:58:12,321
Hey, Cappy. I'm Jeff.
Sorry I'm late.

1049
00:58:12,373 --> 00:58:13,605
Ease her out there,
Junior.

1050
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:14,768
You got it, Cap.

1051
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,542
- Where's your gear?
- Gear?

1052
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:19,161
You don't think this sweater's
gonna be warm enough?

1053
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:21,257
Yeah, it'll be
warm enough for today,

1054
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:25,551
but the weather might
get dirty over the next
four to six weeks.

1055
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:30,556
And even though I made
a little mistake by boarding
a month-long cruise,

1056
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:34,142
being aboard a boat without
having the responsibility
of captaining it

1057
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:38,430
was gonna be like
playing the lotto without
having to buy the tickets.

1058
00:58:38,465 --> 00:58:40,432
<i>It was going to be heaven.</i>

1059
00:58:40,467 --> 00:58:44,069
<i>And while we steamed into it,
all I thought about was Lynn</i>

1060
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,138
<i>lying in bed, watching reruns
of the Luggage Channel.</i>

1061
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:51,026
<i>With this peerless
Cincinnati Sateen rolling bag,</i>

1062
00:58:51,078 --> 00:58:54,613
<i>you'll be the toast
of high tea in London.</i>

1063
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,507
<i>And thanks to this patented
tri-fold center strap,</i>

1064
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,543
<i>when you land in Dubai,</i>

1065
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:09,661
<i>say bye-bye to creases
in your clothing.</i>

1066
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,433
<i>And now for</i>
<i>my favorite feature,</i>
<i>the snap pocket.</i>

1067
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:23,275
Junior,
get fuckin' Santa's helper
to lift the fuckin' nets out!

1068
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,844
Dipshit, give me a fuckin' hand!

1069
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:29,180
- All right.
- Hold onto that.

1070
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,449
Tight!

1071
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:38,073
Right,
when I say when, pull.

1072
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,458
What?

1073
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,377
When I...
When I say when, pull.

1074
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,413
I already am pulling on it.

1075
00:59:44,465 --> 00:59:46,748
Just... You know what?
Don't pull.

1076
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,533
I don't need your help.
Go. Go.

1077
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,113
You need a spotter
or something?

1078
00:59:50,137 --> 00:59:52,554
No, I don't need a spotter.
Fuck, man.

1079
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,723
Get the fuck out of here.
A spotter!

1080
00:59:58,378 --> 01:00:00,178
Morning, Cappy.

1081
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,682
Man the wheel.

1082
01:00:03,717 --> 01:00:05,462
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1083
01:00:05,486 --> 01:00:06,796
I've sunk
one of these before.

1084
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,465
- You've what?
- I sunk one.

1085
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:09,404
Just go.

1086
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,772
Go, go. Get Junior.

1087
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:13,344
Tell him I need
a man up here.

1088
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:18,830
These nets
look different.

1089
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:22,284
Yeah. It's 'cause
we're going for weak fish.

1090
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:23,585
Weak fish?

1091
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,288
The small white ones.
Use them as bait.

1092
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,756
Nothing, right?

1093
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,125
You're such a fuckin' idiot.

1094
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:31,409
Get a wrench
and help me out.

1095
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,411
Okay.

1096
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,191
Come on, princess,
bring it up.

1097
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:39,751
Come on, give it some gas!
Get the whip line.

1098
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,604
You see, when you're netting
for a particular kind of fish

1099
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,390
and one that may not already
be in danger of being wiped out,

1100
01:00:45,425 --> 01:00:47,442
you inevitably scoop up
those that are.

1101
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,194
<i>It's called a by catch.</i>

1102
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,469
It's coming.

1103
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:55,867
<i>I spent my whole life trying
to catch fish like this.</i>

1104
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:59,321
<i>We're talking about Spanish
mackerel, porgies, tuna,</i>

1105
01:00:59,373 --> 01:01:03,158
<i>and the most amazing and
beautiful sport fish of all...</i>

1106
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,460
<i>The striped bass.</i>

1107
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,612
<i>We struck gold.</i>

1108
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:10,499
<i>It was the kind of gold
you had to throw back.</i>

1109
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,306
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the fuck, man!

1110
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,203
I'm throwing them back,
Cappy. They're beautiful.

1111
01:01:20,227 --> 01:01:21,476
And they're dying.

1112
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:22,678
What the fuck!

1113
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,491
Listen, Cappy,
I may not know much,

1114
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,609
but I know it's illegal to
net for these kind of fish.

1115
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:28,767
We'll throw them back later.

1116
01:01:28,802 --> 01:01:30,580
But, Cappy, you'll be
throwing them back dead.

1117
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,637
I said we'll
throw them back later!

1118
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:36,241
Now, every fuckin fish that
swims by here right now,

1119
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,361
that's 3.25 to the pound
that I'm losing!

1120
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:41,863
Now, I'm going to give you
to the count of three

1121
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:46,785
to get the goddamn nets
back out!

1122
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,503
One, two...

1123
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,289
Okay, okay.

1124
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:58,296
<i>Now, I am no great
environmentalist, okay?</i>

1125
01:01:58,331 --> 01:01:59,848
Hell, I don't even recycle.

1126
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:03,969
But what Al was proposing
was murdering all these fish.

1127
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:12,360
No! No! No! No!

1128
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:14,679
I'm not going to let you
bastards get away with this.

1129
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,458
You're going
to have to kill me

1130
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,017
before I let these fish
suffocate on deck.

1131
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,852
It's either me
or the fish, gentlemen.

1132
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:26,825
But I swear, I will gut you
before you get me overboard.

1133
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,829
All I'm asking is you let me
throw these fish back

1134
01:02:30,864 --> 01:02:32,842
before you throw
your stinking nets out there.

1135
01:02:32,866 --> 01:02:35,467
It'll only take a minute.
How's it going to go down?

1136
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,253
This is mutiny, faggy.

1137
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:39,888
You lose your quarter share.

1138
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,339
So be it.

1139
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:44,893
Junior, get back on the crane.

1140
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,985
Go ahead.

1141
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,751
You're in such
a world of shit.

1142
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,324
It's my world.

1143
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,805
Tell me when
you find Nemo.

1144
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:04,996
What I didn't figure
into my mutiny was...

1145
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,976
<i>now I was going to be
at sea for three weeks</i>

1146
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,718
<i>with people who
wanted to kill me.</i>

1147
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:12,521
<i>People die at sea
all the time.</i>

1148
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:15,323
<i>It didn't matter.
Neither the threat of death</i>

1149
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,270
<i>or the loss of money
mattered at all to me</i>

1150
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,972
<i>because I knew that
as soon as I got home,</i>

1151
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:21,696
<i>I would have Lynn there
waiting for me.</i>

1152
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,311
It says there's
a tropical storm
off the coast.

1153
01:03:36,363 --> 01:03:38,563
Yeah, I read that, too.

1154
01:03:38,598 --> 01:03:40,982
It's supposed to be
40-knot winds.

1155
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:43,869
Do you think it'd be safe
to be on a boat?

1156
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:47,072
I sure as hell wouldn't
want to be on one.

1157
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,716
You expecting someone?

1158
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,765
- Yes?
- Are you Lynn Ferguson?

1159
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,950
I am.

1160
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:17,635
Hi, Miss Ferguson.
Sorry to bother you.

1161
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,048
We have a judgment
against Jeff Nichols,

1162
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:22,023
and he listed this
as his primary address.

1163
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:26,862
Me and my friend Peanut
are here to repossess
that diamond necklace.

1164
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:33,418
Uh, I'll go grab the box.

1165
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,691
May I ask you
what is this about?

1166
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:47,382
Well, grandpa,
looks like some loverboy

1167
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,552
bought your daughter
a necklace he couldn't afford.

1168
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:56,775
Thank you.

1169
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:11,039
I... I can't wait to see her.

1170
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:15,160
In fact, does anyone know
where there's a good florist?

1171
01:05:15,195 --> 01:05:16,711
Whoa.

1172
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,797
Thanks for letting me share.

1173
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,498
Thanks, Jeff.

1174
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:37,983
Lynn!

1175
01:05:41,888 --> 01:05:43,688
Wait. Wait, wait!

1176
01:05:43,723 --> 01:05:46,191
Wait! Why are you running?

1177
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:49,861
Lynn!

1178
01:05:52,065 --> 01:05:54,499
Wait.

1179
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,584
Wait.

1180
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,870
Give me a moment.

1181
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:00,705
I just got back.

1182
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:04,575
I went to a quick meeting,
but then I came straight here.

1183
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:07,963
They didn't have
a phone on the boat.

1184
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:12,217
I've missed you so much.

1185
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,212
Why aren't you wearing
your necklace?

1186
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,477
It's over, Jeff.

1187
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:23,645
Over!

1188
01:06:23,697 --> 01:06:25,647
Wait.

1189
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:30,201
Do you mean it's over
between you and Terry
or you and me?

1190
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:45,050
You can't go.
I've got my six-month
anniversary coming up.

1191
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,219
Yeah. Well,
I got my 10-year
anniversary coming up.

1192
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:51,256
What have I done
with my time? Nothing.

1193
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,508
I need help, Lenny.

1194
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,627
I just lost
the love of my life
due to poor accounting,

1195
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,707
I'm here. I'll help you.

1196
01:06:57,731 --> 01:06:58,847
I got a new tactic.

1197
01:06:58,899 --> 01:07:00,598
It's called surrender.

1198
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:04,302
See, me and details, we went
to battle three decades ago,

1199
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:08,106
and I can honestly say
that that war is over,
and I've lost.

1200
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:10,692
So you're just
going to be a bum?

1201
01:07:10,744 --> 01:07:14,112
I'm retiring. Mike's brother has
got a garage apartment in Quogue

1202
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:15,580
he's going to rent me
real cheap.

1203
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:18,166
I got all I need right here.

1204
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,952
Okay, retire,
but promise me one thing.

1205
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:22,631
You'll keep going
to meetings

1206
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:24,917
'cause those people need you
as much as you need them.

1207
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:27,876
Lenny, how can I expect
other people to be
interested in my problems

1208
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:29,794
when they don't even
impress me?

1209
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:33,014
I have learning disabilities,
and I drank a lot
when I was a kid.

1210
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,933
It's like having gingivitis,
you know?

1211
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,601
Buy a toothbrush,
get on with it.

1212
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,054
I cannot believe
I'm hearing you say this.

1213
01:07:40,173 --> 01:07:42,857
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Lenny.

1214
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:45,143
It was good knowing you, man.
Don't drink.

1215
01:07:59,793 --> 01:08:01,076
Hey, Jeff!

1216
01:08:01,128 --> 01:08:02,911
Hey, Uncle Popcorn.

1217
01:08:02,963 --> 01:08:04,796
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1218
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,642
Don't call me
Uncle Popcorn, okay?

1219
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:07,865
Yeah, sure.

1220
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:09,867
- Give me that.
- Okay. All right.

1221
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:12,837
Hey, all this is yours, man,
any time you want to use it.

1222
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:14,016
You know how to use
this thing here?

1223
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,039
Not really.

1224
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:17,175
Let me show you.
It's easy.

1225
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,595
Step up, step up, and ho!

1226
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:21,707
- Wow!
- Ho!

1227
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:23,815
All right!

1228
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:27,318
Okay? Give it a try.
Come on.

1229
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,906
That's it.

1230
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,224
Ah, it's all right.
It's all right.

1231
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:36,277
- No, no, that ain't the way.
- Okay.

1232
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:39,030
- All right, let's go.
- Sorry.

1233
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:41,616
Don't use that
until I show you how.

1234
01:08:41,668 --> 01:08:44,085
And my barbeque here?
You don't fuckin' touch that.

1235
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,370
Absolutely not.

1236
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:47,738
I got you fixed up
in the back there

1237
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:49,090
above the garage.

1238
01:08:49,176 --> 01:08:50,842
<i>Without going to meetings</i>

1239
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,344
<i>and without the responsibility
of being a mentor,</i>

1240
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:57,165
<i>I figured retirement
would be easy, but it wasn't.</i>

1241
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,236
<i>Because I couldn't</i>
<i>stop thinking about</i>
<i>what happened on the boat.</i>

1242
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:02,815
<i>I didn't know why it was
upsetting me so much</i>

1243
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:05,974
<i>until I figured out
that the fish chose me.</i>

1244
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:11,079
<i>Like Lynn, they were in trouble
because they chose me.</i>

1245
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:12,763
<i>I wanted to save them,</i>

1246
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:15,099
<i>and the only way I could
was to write.</i>

1247
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:17,385
<i>So despite my LDs,</i>

1248
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,706
<i>I started working on a letter
to a national fishing magazine.</i>

1249
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:30,865
Dear Hooked on Fishing,

1250
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:34,836
this really bad thing happened.

1251
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:51,730
...which was<i> breehly</i> bad.
That's right.

1252
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:56,991
Hey, Uncle Popcorn,
come in.

1253
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:59,827
Jeff, we got to talk.

1254
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,698
Great, cause I been dying
to talk to somebody.

1255
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,279
This letter is a lot more
difficult than I thought
it was going to be.

1256
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:08,503
Plus it was really cold
in here last night.

1257
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,955
But that's okay because the heat
throws off my equilibrium,

1258
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,841
and it kind of
makes me twitchy, so...
I can fight through it.

1259
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:20,098
Do you have a dictionary,
or do you think you could
proofread this for me?

1260
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,934
What do you think,
Uncle Popcorn?

1261
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,314
First of all, I asked you to
stop calling me Uncle Popcorn.

1262
01:10:25,338 --> 01:10:27,316
It's a name
the little kids call me,

1263
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,007
and they usually
stop doing it when
they're six or seven.

1264
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:31,726
What do I call you then?
Uncle Bert?

1265
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:34,279
How about Bert?
I'm not your uncle.

1266
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,846
Well, you're Mike's brother.

1267
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,365
He's your stepfather.

1268
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,783
He's like a father.

1269
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,287
Hell, Jeff,
you're a grown man

1270
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,872
Grown men do not call
each other "uncle."

1271
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,457
Okay.

1272
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:49,377
And another thing
grown men do is pay rent.

1273
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,307
You're already
three weeks late.

1274
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:53,881
I'm sorry. It's coming.

1275
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,334
- When?
- Soon. I've got
checks in the mail.

1276
01:10:56,369 --> 01:10:59,053
There literally are checks
sitting in the mailbox.

1277
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,484
Jeff, I checked your mailbox.
There's nothing in there.

1278
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,424
Not that one.

1279
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:06,227
It's a mailing address
from this old apartment
that I used to live in,

1280
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,062
and it was like
three years ago.

1281
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:09,314
My friend moved in,

1282
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,733
and then he left
and this new guy came in.

1283
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,518
I haven't been there
for like nine months.

1284
01:11:13,553 --> 01:11:15,019
This guy's got a bad vibe.

1285
01:11:15,054 --> 01:11:16,465
I just don't want
to deal with him right now.

1286
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,801
Why don't you just put in
a change of address?

1287
01:11:18,825 --> 01:11:23,077
What? I'm supposed to notify
everybody that sends me mail
where I moving to?

1288
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:27,532
Yeah. It's what
normal people do.

1289
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:30,012
You just fill out
a little form at
the post office.

1290
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:33,454
Okay, listen,
if it's important to you,

1291
01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:36,007
I can go see my mommy
in Westchester

1292
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,043
and borrow some money
from her.

1293
01:11:39,078 --> 01:11:42,430
Jeff, that... that...

1294
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:45,883
see, that's what
this is all about.

1295
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:47,852
That's the thing here.

1296
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:52,240
You know, for years,
Mike has been telling me
about how great you are,

1297
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:55,426
how nice you are,
how caring.

1298
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:59,530
Then he tells me about
all your fuck-ups.

1299
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:02,200
And I know that every time
you sink a boat

1300
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:05,236
or lose a job
or have to pay rent,

1301
01:12:05,271 --> 01:12:08,323
you go crying
to your mommy.

1302
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:11,075
And her and Mike
have to bail you out.

1303
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,110
Well, they just catch me
when I slip up.

1304
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:15,279
No. They coddle you

1305
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:19,801
and prevent you from taking
any sort of responsibility,
like a child.

1306
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,269
Hell, not even.

1307
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:23,271
I've got
an 11-year-old grandson

1308
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:25,506
who's had a paper route
for two years.

1309
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:28,593
Have you ever
held a job that long?

1310
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,296
No. I have...

1311
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:35,516
I have learning
disabilities, too.

1312
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:40,171
Hmm. When I was your age,
you know what we called that?

1313
01:12:40,206 --> 01:12:41,522
Retardation.

1314
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:45,309
Hell, even those people
got jobs

1315
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:49,297
assembling cardboard boxes
or cleaning toilets,

1316
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:52,583
unlike the modern day version
that waddle around,

1317
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:56,537
moaning about
how difficult everything is.

1318
01:12:56,589 --> 01:13:00,658
They spend their
entire lives doing nothing

1319
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:03,961
and leeching off
their parents

1320
01:13:03,996 --> 01:13:05,963
and their Uncle Popcorns.

1321
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,219
You want another week?
Fine.

1322
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,105
I'll give you a week,

1323
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:18,693
then I'm going to
call up Mike and ask him
for the money myself.

1324
01:13:42,535 --> 01:13:44,419
Goddamn it.

1325
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:52,477
Tanya, it's him!
Keep the cat in the bedroom.

1326
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:56,481
Don't be a pussyfoot!
Kick his ass right now!

1327
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,432
Here.

1328
01:13:57,484 --> 01:13:58,683
It's been nine months.

1329
01:13:58,718 --> 01:14:01,569
Honestly, take this
and never come back.

1330
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:05,239
Please, I am so sick
of holding on to
your fuckin' crap.

1331
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:06,991
It's goddamn ridiculous.

1332
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,265
Jeff.

1333
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:34,018
- Hey.
- It's cold outside.

1334
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,470
How long have you
been out here?

1335
01:14:35,522 --> 01:14:39,640
Not long. Just, uh,
I was in the city, so...

1336
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:41,275
Are you okay?

1337
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:43,528
Haven't seen you
around the rooms lately.

1338
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,674
I quit going
to the meetings.

1339
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:47,743
Today would have been
my ten-year anniversary.

1340
01:14:47,767 --> 01:14:50,451
It's good though. It is.

1341
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:53,738
I've been real productive
with all my free time.

1342
01:14:53,773 --> 01:14:55,323
A regular workhorse.

1343
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,277
How are you?
Are you married yet?

1344
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:02,630
Not yet.

1345
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,454
I'd marry you, Lynn.
You know that?

1346
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:13,591
But, Jeff,
what would happen?

1347
01:15:13,626 --> 01:15:17,127
I mean,
you're a sweet guy,

1348
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:21,298
and you're funny, and I'm
really attracted to you,

1349
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:26,187
but what kind of a life would
we lead if you can't even...

1350
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,573
clean your own bedroom?

1351
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:31,275
Technically,
it'd be half your room.

1352
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:39,367
Jeff...

1353
01:15:39,419 --> 01:15:42,670
I never expected
to fall in love with you.

1354
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,423
It was the easiest thing
I ever did.

1355
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:51,095
But if something bad happened,
and I drank again,

1356
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,097
I could really hurt myself.

1357
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,599
Nothing bad would happen.

1358
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:58,553
I just don't have what it takes
to build a life with you.

1359
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:04,809
I'm sorry.

1360
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,282
Don't drink.

1361
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:18,039
I accept.

1362
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,156
Hi, Mommy.

1363
01:16:19,191 --> 01:16:22,126
<i>Hi, Jeff.</i>

1364
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,161
Listen, I'm a little upset.

1365
01:16:24,196 --> 01:16:26,625
I was wondering if I could
come and stay with you
in Westchester tonight.

1366
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:28,677
Oh, Mike and I
are headed to Florida.

1367
01:16:28,701 --> 01:16:30,345
I'm just about to meet him
at the airport.

1368
01:16:30,369 --> 01:16:31,802
What's wrong, sweetie?

1369
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:33,721
A little sad, that's all.

1370
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,190
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

1371
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,404
<i>If you want to come up</i>
<i>and stay at the house</i>
<i>while we're gone,</i>

1372
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:39,838
<i>I'm sure
that would be fine.</i>

1373
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:42,346
I would just like you
to ask Mike directly.

1374
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:45,433
No, I'd rather not.

1375
01:16:45,485 --> 01:16:47,485
I don't want to ask
any more favors.

1376
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,448
Well, he's happy
to do favors for you.

1377
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:51,700
He loves you.
I... Just, please.

1378
01:16:51,724 --> 01:16:55,192
If you decide
you want to come up
and stay for a few days,

1379
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:56,744
all you have to do is ask.

1380
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,580
You know what?
I will if I go there.

1381
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:01,082
I love you, Mommy.

1382
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,851
I love you, too, sweetie,
Feel better.

1383
01:17:19,418 --> 01:17:22,803
Today I will clean.

1384
01:17:37,937 --> 01:17:40,121
Ugh...

1385
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,272
Damn it.

1386
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:47,328
Would you please stop
returning your W-2 form
to me personally?

1387
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:51,448
You're supposed
to mail these to the IRS.

1388
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:53,951
Oh. Thanks.

1389
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:59,674
Would you please stop
returning your W-2 form
to me personally?

1390
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:02,643
You're supposed to mail these
to the IRS.

1391
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,323
You're supposed to mail these
to the IRS.

1392
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:05,429
Mommy...

1393
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:11,268
I don't mind paying
for your parking tickets
when you get them,

1394
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:12,987
but if you don't pay them,

1395
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,272
since it's my car,
it goes against my credit.

1396
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:18,776
Just call this number here
when you get one.

1397
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:21,979
It's my CPA, and she will
handle the tickets.

1398
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,914
Thanks. They're already
taken take of.

1399
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,367
- Call this number...
- Mail these to the IRS.

1400
01:18:26,419 --> 01:18:29,420
...when you get one.
It's my CPA. She will
handle the tickets.

1401
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,989
I've got to call.

1402
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:36,293
Don't get the phone...
I have to pay
the phone bill.

1403
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:37,628
Verizon bill.

1404
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:42,433
Verizon!

1405
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,468
$487?

1406
01:18:44,503 --> 01:18:46,854
For cable?

1407
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,951
There's a check
around here somewhere.

1408
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:50,357
Where's the paycheck?

1409
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,860
Call this number...

1410
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,445
Aha!

1411
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:59,483
$493. Thank you,
Mrs. Shelby.

1412
01:19:07,026 --> 01:19:08,525
Hi, Verizon?

1413
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:10,628
I have
a personal check here.

1414
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:14,632
I just want to...
turn my phone back on.

1415
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,586
If you have no credit or debit
card or a checking account,
you will need a money order.

1416
01:19:18,638 --> 01:19:20,554
How do I do that?

1417
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,641
Do you have a state-issued
I.D. card?

1418
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:24,787
No.

1419
01:19:24,811 --> 01:19:25,893
Passport?

1420
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,378
No. I lost it.

1421
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,881
Social security card?

1422
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,483
No.

1423
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,362
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't help you.

1424
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:35,581
Jeff!

1425
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:36,904
Where the fuck's my rent?

1426
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,907
I'll give it to you
in a minute.

1427
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,860
All right, hurry up.
I'll be in New York.

1428
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,461
Take me, Jeff.
I'll play in my box.

1429
01:20:00,513 --> 01:20:02,412
There's pumas and everything.

1430
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,558
- Come with me!
- Not now!

1431
01:20:03,582 --> 01:20:04,799
It's so much fun in here.

1432
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:06,917
Leave me alone!

1433
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:10,020
I'll play with
your nut sack, Jeff.
Jeff, come in here.

1434
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:12,690
I want you
to come and play.

1435
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,562
Jeff, come here.

1436
01:20:18,597 --> 01:20:19,780
I just have to do a...

1437
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:21,949
Come here.

1438
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,951
Jeff, get over here!

1439
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,987
Hold on! God damn you!
Hold on!

1440
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,052
I gotta...
I'm going to the store.
Going to the store.

1441
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:33,043
- Be right back.
- Jeff!

1442
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:34,795
Stop that car right now!

1443
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,665
You said you needed milk,
so I figured...

1444
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:44,555
Hi. My name is Jeff,
and I'm an alcoholic.

1445
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,901
Hi, Jeff.

1446
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:49,727
I swore I wouldn't
come back to the rooms.

1447
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:54,748
Yesterday was
a difficult day for me.

1448
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,102
I needed comfort.
I had to go home.

1449
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,864
<i>The first thing that Mike did
when he moved in was...</i>

1450
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:14,335
<i>he hung up a replica of
the fast trout I caught.</i>

1451
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,588
Your mother said it looked
just like the one you got.

1452
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:21,125
I think it might have been
a little bigger, Mike.
Jeff is an excellent fisherman.

1453
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,877
Uh...

1454
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:24,712
Jeff...

1455
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:26,775
I want you to know
that I bought this house

1456
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,767
because I want you
and your mother

1457
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,003
to have a place
where you can always go

1458
01:21:33,022 --> 01:21:36,974
and feel like
things haven't changed.

1459
01:21:37,009 --> 01:21:38,153
You understand me?

1460
01:21:38,177 --> 01:21:39,810
Yeah.

1461
01:21:42,681 --> 01:21:46,150
<i>I loved that trout.</i>

1462
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:48,652
<i>The house was a haven,</i>

1463
01:21:48,687 --> 01:21:51,739
<i>always open to me,
provided I asked.</i>

1464
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:54,158
<i>Instead of using
the furnace,</i>

1465
01:21:54,193 --> 01:21:57,745
<i>which would have caused</i>
<i>a noticeable spike</i>
<i>in the heating bill,</i>

1466
01:21:57,797 --> 01:22:03,584
<i>I used a space heater</i>
<i>to keep me warm while</i>
<i>I lay on the couch.</i>

1467
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:57,587
<i>I slept so soundly.</i>

1468
01:22:57,606 --> 01:23:02,226
<i>And then... I smelt it.</i>

1469
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:10,617
What... Oh, shit!

1470
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,154
Shit! Fuck.
Oh, shit.

1471
01:23:17,276 --> 01:23:18,892
Oh, Jesus.

1472
01:23:36,829 --> 01:23:39,913
Something very bad
has happened.

1473
01:23:43,736 --> 01:23:46,570
I just... I've come from the...

1474
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:51,942
Mike, I did
some rewiring work
a week or two ago.

1475
01:23:51,977 --> 01:23:56,080
Some of the old stuff you had in
there looked a little dangerous.

1476
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,751
I got insurance,
so I'm protected
if I made a mistake,

1477
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:05,005
but I tell you, I really
thought I made it safer.

1478
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:09,176
See, Mike?
Andy could've started it.

1479
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,161
Jeff, you weren't here
last night, were you?

1480
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:14,164
Like I was saying,
that wiring was pretty old.

1481
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:18,052
I'll probably lose my license.

1482
01:24:18,104 --> 01:24:21,138
But hell, if did that,
I deserve it.

1483
01:24:21,173 --> 01:24:23,785
Andy, you've done such great
work for us, but this time...

1484
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,526
I know, I know.

1485
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:27,923
Thank God, it was you,
Andy. Thank God!

1486
01:24:27,947 --> 01:24:30,030
It was me.

1487
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:34,318
I was here.

1488
01:24:34,353 --> 01:24:36,593
I didn't want you to see
that I was here,

1489
01:24:36,622 --> 01:24:40,240
so I used a space heater
instead of turning on
the furnace.

1490
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:44,044
I, uh, I accidentally
burnt one of the cushions.

1491
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,796
I tried to hide it, okay?

1492
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:49,883
That's how the fire started.
It was my fault, not Andy's.

1493
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:53,587
I burned your house down.

1494
01:24:53,639 --> 01:24:54,805
I'm sorry, Mike.

1495
01:25:09,155 --> 01:25:12,239
Go sit in the fucking car.

1496
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,201
I'm so sorry, darling.

1497
01:25:25,404 --> 01:25:27,254
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

1498
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:31,291
Wait a second.
I found something!

1499
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:35,045
Look what I found!

1500
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,361
I'm gonna run a hose
from the auxiliary,
all right?

1501
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,852
It's Jeff's fish!

1502
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,807
So...

1503
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:51,645
the only thing that's left of
the house in which I grew up

1504
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,233
is a replica of the very
first trout I ever caught

1505
01:25:56,268 --> 01:25:58,902
melted down
to its original size.

1506
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,943
You're a hot man, honey.

1507
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:09,163
Hah! You're hot!

1508
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:36,073
Definitely.
I burned the house down.

1509
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,075
I burned it down.

1510
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,326
It's his house.

1511
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,329
They're right there.
Say hi, Mike.

1512
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,147
That's my stepdad.

1513
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:46,450
There's my lovely mommy.
Yeah.

1514
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:50,170
And the trout, it started off
right about here,

1515
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,707
and then it melted down to
pretty much its original size.

1516
01:26:53,759 --> 01:26:55,759
If you guys want to
go and see it, you can.

1517
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:58,828
It's mounted at my mommy and
Mike's new house in Florida.

1518
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:01,181
You're going to have to
go by yourself because,

1519
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:04,134
as you can guess, yeah,
I'm not invited.

1520
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:10,324
You can put your shoes back on
now because I'm out of here.

1521
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:14,461
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

1522
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:16,463
Thank you.

1525
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:32,829
Uh, how does
comedy pay, Jeff?

1526
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,465
You know, it doesn't
really pay all that well.

1527
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:37,112
I know what you're thinking.
You don't have to worry.

1528
01:27:37,136 --> 01:27:38,980
I'm going to pay you back
for the yacht and the house

1529
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:41,755
and all the things
you don't even know about.

1530
01:27:41,807 --> 01:27:43,423
- I got a new job.
- Oh?

1531
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:45,153
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna keep this one.

1532
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,977
Well!

1533
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,846
I got something I think
you're gonna like.

1534
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:52,399
Take the bricks,
put them in that bin.

1535
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,235
Glass, yellow bin.
Metal in the blue bin.

Thank you, Lenny.

01:28:00,826 --> 01:28:03,193
You're my mentor.
I take care of you, okay?

1538
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:06,258
But get moving 'cause I want
to get to the Kick Starters
meeting by 7:30.

1539
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:08,365
You got it.

1540
01:28:22,097 --> 01:28:23,547
Whoo!

1541
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:30,420
<i>I don't know if I'll ever
amount to anything in life,</i>

1542
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:33,557
<i>if I'll ever be</i>
<i>able to overcome</i>
<i>my learning disabilities,</i>

1543
01:28:33,592 --> 01:28:38,395
<i>but I'm going to try to
take care of the details.</i>

1544
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:43,033
<i>I also decided that before</i>
<i>I get too old or before</i>
<i>I'm institutionalized</i>

1545
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,202
<i>that I might as well
make an effort</i>

1546
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:48,104
<i>at tackling a learning disabled
person's biggest nightmare...</i>

1547
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:50,940
<i>To captain a boat.</i>

1548
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:52,876
Jeff!

1549
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:57,914
Captain!

1550
01:29:02,471 --> 01:29:04,054
I tried calling you.

1551
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,556
For once, your phone
wasn't shut off.

1552
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:10,227
Your landlord told me
that I could find you here.

1553
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:14,964
Look. I found this mixed in
with Terry's boating things.

1554
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:17,133
They published your
letter to the editor.

1555
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,518
Wow.

1556
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,320
They didn't change anything.

1557
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,906
Not even the mistakes.

1558
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:29,029
Is that mine?

1559
01:29:29,081 --> 01:29:31,147
I honestly don't know.

1560
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:34,418
Wow.

1561
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:36,870
That's great either way.

1562
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:40,006
I would love to be a father
or a stepfather.

1563
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,542
I got a lot of experience
with my own.

1564
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:46,213
Jeff, I wanted
to talk to you.

1565
01:29:46,265 --> 01:29:48,014
I left Terry.

1566
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:51,301
Great.

1567
01:29:52,938 --> 01:29:56,005
Do you want to go fishing?
I got an extra rod.

1568
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:58,475
The open sea is
a perfect place to chat.

1569
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:01,027
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

1570
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:04,180
It's not just me anymore.

1571
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:06,616
Right. Good point.

1572
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:08,985
Do you want to fish
off the dock?

1573
01:30:11,206 --> 01:30:13,657
- Okay.
- All right.

1574
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:21,531
Wow.<i> Victory.</i>

All right, here we go.
We have your next act.

1618
01:32:58,857 --> 01:33:02,125
What can I say about
this funny guy? Funny man.

1619
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,077
You probably saw him
on the Luggage Channel.

1620
01:33:04,129 --> 01:33:08,164
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jeff Nichols, everybody.
Jeff Nichols!

1621
01:33:08,199 --> 01:33:12,552
This guy looks like Rain Man
and Forrest Gump on crack,
don't I, a little bit?

1622
01:33:12,588 --> 01:33:15,204
I sound like Rudy Giuliani
on NyQuil, don't I,
a little bit?

1623
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:18,808
I'm a friggin' mess.
My life is a disaster,

1624
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:21,711
I should've been
out of this business like
before I walked on stage.

1625
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,212
How you doin'?
All right.

1626
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:25,715
I subbed for years,
five years in the Bronx.

1627
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:27,662
I taught school
in the Bronx and Queens.

1628
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:30,070
I taught in...
You gonna call my bluff?

1629
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:36,409
No. I taught in
like a lot of them
'cause I sucked.

1630
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:38,445
I sucked.

1631
01:33:38,497 --> 01:33:42,248
True. The first day I school,
I went to the principal.

1632
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:44,901
I go to the principal.
I go, "I'm a comic.
I drive around."

1633
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,598
What wisdom can I
impart to these kids?

1634
01:33:46,622 --> 01:33:49,422
"What can I possibly
teach these kids?"

1635
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,719
She goes, "Don't worry,
just teach the kids
what you know",

1636
01:33:51,743 --> 01:33:53,343
what you're good at."

1637
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,657
First day of school,
everyone: "Today, kids",

1638
01:33:55,681 --> 01:33:58,860
we're gonna learn how
to stare at women 'til
they get uncomfortable."

1639
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:06,723
"Today, kids, we're
going to learn to have
an anxiety attack."
