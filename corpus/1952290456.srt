- However we believe that...

I know that too. - So what's the big deal
over some corn syrup, caffeine and water?

Well the big deal is my secret ingredient.

Not even the name!

00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:48,450
Converting violence into drug trading.
Moving around without being detected.

334
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:50,388
It's about buying new tech explosives...

335
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:54,020
which you strap on... getting children
and women killed...

336
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,770
Cats, dogs you name it.

337
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:56,954
Terrorists?

338
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:00,450
Oh! Shit!

339
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,024
That's our guy.

340
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:11,810
Next apartment. Some drug addicts.

341
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:24,738
Is that the guy you going to kill?
- I didn't say I was going to kill him.

342
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:26,714
Just tell him I'm going to party.
- Party?

343
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,621
Yeah, tell him we want two big interjection
in that building.

344
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,583
Go ahead tell him.

345
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:34,614
Bonjour!

346
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,345
My friend and I.
- And you would like to watch?

347
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:02,582
Enjoy! they're repel I got them off
a suite in Thailand.

348
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,199
What about the pimp?
- Go for it whatever gets shock.

349
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,354
How about I get off this elevator?

350
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:12,861
James?
- Caroline? Caroline, Caroline!

351
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:18,945
The cool thing about French chicks you know?
Is as uptight as an American drawers.

352
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:21,029
Well she's not very French like that, Wax!

353
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:24,961
And she's definitely want to know what I was
doing in that elevator. With you and and her!

354
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,085
Yeah well maybe you should be asking
her what she was doing in this part of town?

355
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,831
She was buying fabric.
She makes her own clothes.

356
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:33,114
What am I supposed to do now?
I'm totally fucked!

357
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:36,112
No, no after the fact that I told her
how you pulled the trigger saved the day.

358
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,224
You think I'm just going to stand here and lose
my girl while you get laid...

359
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:42,080
Haven't you learned anything since
we've met?

360
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:48,009
Watch now, motherfucker. Move move.

361
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:53,544
Halt, give me the charger.

362
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:56,859
Hell! That's the big boss shit I'm
looking for!

363
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,696
Give me the charger.

364
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,167
Faster!

365
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:06,149
What the fuck are you doing man?

366
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:09,947
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?
I'm charging my fucking cell.

367
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,804
When you're done. Why don't you check out the
bank our friend is using to launder drug money

368
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:22,371
What am I looking for? - You're looking for
a Pakistani with a big bag of coke.

369
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,954
Or a rag head pushing a wheel cart
filled with cash.

370
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:34,258
Unbelievable.

371
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:40,169
I swear what you saw is not like
what it seems.

372
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,923
Well it seems like you're riding up the
elevator with some hooker and her pimp.

373
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:47,309
Yes, she is a hooker.
And no that guy is not her pimp.

374
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,744
What the hell is he then? Tell me.

375
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:53,032
You know I can't discuss my work.

376
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:55,567
Well you should probably make an exception
this time James.

377
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:04,488
Is this crazy partner that they got
me working with. Okay.

378
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:08,223
What? The pimp partner? He didn't exactly
look like the embassy type to me.

379
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,866
He's not. He's known specifically
for this one job.

380
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,141
Well I don't like you living means working
guys like him.

381
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:16,288
Caroline! I don't like it either.

382
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:19,823
Then stop doing whatever it is you're doing
and bring your friend for dinner if you want.

383
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:23,028
But please come home.
- Open up the door!

384
00:41:23,206 --> 00:41:26,898
Shit... Open up.
- I would have to call you back okay.

385
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:29,493
God, I love this country.

386
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:32,437
And they backed their acts on this side?
- Yeah, what about the front door?

387
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:36,957
Probably that Pakistani pimp, kill the
fucker. - I am not going to kill the guy, Wax!

388
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:50,442
And hello fucking we got customers.

389
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:08,919
Now next time I'd tell you to shoot
the fucker. Shoot the fucker.

390
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:31,612
Hey, Reece.

391
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:33,994
You like shopping?

392
00:42:34,695 --> 00:42:38,219
Come on Wax! Let's just finish
the job and go home. Okay.

393
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:40,952
Miss out on the finer things that Paris
has to offer?

394
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:42,843
What?

395
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:46,706
After all this mess that we've been thru',
you're just going to let him walk?

396
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:51,446
No, worries. We'll just handing them
off to the eye in the sky.

397
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,500
Request for level 1, satellite video
surveillance.

398
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:58,250
NSA guide one track re assignment protocol
for satellite repositioning.

399
00:42:58,282 --> 00:42:59,895
Sending target coordinates package.

400
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:02,660
Visualize. Confirming visual identification.
Target has parked.

401
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:03,861
Passenger has entered building.

402
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:07,192
Transferring current location to agent
for target recovery.

403
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:22,036
They didn't mention I was dumping
my Parisian guidebook.

404
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:24,441
Why would dumps here be any
different to the dumps back home?

405
00:43:24,614 --> 00:43:27,374
I just figuring Paris and all you know...

406
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,639
shithole should be nicer.

407
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:32,649
brings me back to the day.

408
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah! I don't remember them being
particularly happy days.

409
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:39,229
Now. See I always would' figure you
for a Cambridge man. All the way.

410
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:41,444
Cyprus Houses, East New York.

411
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:42,790
Shit. really?

412
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:43,791
{ LAUGHING }

413
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:44,842
You didn't get out much did you?
- Not really.

414
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:47,843
I was the only kids that made off
my block alive though.

415
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:51,005
I wish someone had locked me up.

416
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,621
I was always wondering what guys like you
all locked up in apartments reading and shit.

417
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,276
Mostly watching Star Trek.
- Star Trek?

418
00:43:59,277 --> 00:44:02,196
Dreaming of getting out?
Kirk or Spock?

419
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,612
Uhura.

420
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,244
There here we go!

421
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:18,666
Hello, do you speak English?

422
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:22,070
My friend and I are looking to beam inside.

423
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:24,701
That is American dollar.

424
00:44:45,881 --> 00:44:49,043
Wait here.

425
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:51,091
Don't look that one in the eye.

426
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:01,434
He told you not to look that one in the eye.
- Couldn't help it I was curious.

427
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,821
He wants us to get down on the ground?

428
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,940
What the hell are you doing? - Let me give you
a little advice where I picked up in Somalia.

429
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:10,932
When a shady 10 year old points
a gun to your face.

430
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:12,733
You do whenever the fucks he wants.
Now get down here.

431
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,604
He just wants our baling.

432
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:20,474
You feeling homesick yet?
- Fuck no, it's fake.

433
00:45:20,475 --> 00:45:22,913
Well this isn't. Caroline's father
gave it to her.

434
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:26,591
I swear that girl's going to get you killed.

435
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,859
Looks better on me?
- Definitely.

436
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:47,496
Thank you.

437
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:54,028
For you fifty dollars.

438
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,798
Hey what the fuck are you doing?
- That's good shit...

439
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,279
That's Colombian mix with a little
flour? Right?

440
00:46:02,836 --> 00:46:05,456
Now give me a kilo?
- A kilo?

441
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:08,054
You think this is Bogotá?
- What the fuck am I going to do with 5 grams?

442
00:46:08,055 --> 00:46:10,798
Maybe you can sniff it off your
homeboy's ass?

443
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:20,033
Now you can get off your jarring ass and hook
me up with the player that can hook us up.

444
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:24,302
Five grams, is considered personal
consumption. That! they can get away with.

445
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,527
And if more than a kilo it's 15 years
in prison.

446
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:31,927
Wouldn't it be a shame for these motherfucker
to get caught for 5 k. of their own shit.

447
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:36,883
Got caught with 5 kilos of their own shit!

448
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:50,760
Thank you.

449
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:54,754
Give me the fucking ring. Give me the ring!
- Yeah, yeah.

450
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:56,970
That's it, that's it!

451
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:00,041
Give me my fucking ring back.

452
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:03,517
Tell us where that Pakistanis are,
or I'll have him take you for another round.

453
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:06,309
Give it to me, get that fucking ring
off your finger.

454
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:12,181
Oh yeah, boy.

455
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:15,423
Better get in that apartment right
over where the Pakistani's staying.

456
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:19,415
Where you going to be?
What's the made for him?

457
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:23,828
He's going to be like the 26th guy in the last
24 hours. Hey! That's about a guy an hour.

458
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:25,435
All heads up. Go!

459
00:47:37,161 --> 00:47:40,496
Relax old man I'm not going to hurt you.
We'll be gone in five minutes.

460
00:47:40,497 --> 00:47:43,144
Why should I worry? My age there's
nothing to worry about.

461
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,449
You do outlaw deals, you should be
the one to worry.

462
00:47:47,643 --> 00:47:50,240
Mint tea?
- Why the hell not.

463
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:52,309
You think it was that different back
in your day?

464
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,975
It is just as evil...

465
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,426
but it is a lot less polite.

466
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:06,256
Okay Rasid. Let's see we're going to truffle
your buddies or throw it on down there.

467
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:18,810
How's it look?
- About 6 they're closing up shop.

468
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:22,205
Okay. Tell you what we're going to do.

469
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:25,477
I am going to take the scenic route.

470
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:29,166
And you my friend are going to go downstairs
to the tenth floor...

471
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,790
and shoot anybody that comes thru' that door.
You'll going to need this to keep in touch.

472
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:38,725
Thanks.

473
00:48:38,892 --> 00:48:42,551
That's good shit, how I get some?
- You can't. It's home grown nana.

474
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:45,152
Thanks for your hospitality old man.

475
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:49,026
Let's go.

476
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:15,250
Are you in position? Yeah!
You want me inside?

477
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:20,703
Hell! No!

478
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:23,690
They got the door wired!

479
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:50,132
they're going down to the ninth floor,
cut them off.

480
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,036
Freeze.
shut the fuck down.

481
00:50:03,037 --> 00:50:05,411
Get down, down!

482
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:07,588
Get down.

483
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:16,553
No!

484
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,315
Nice work, Reece.
- What's so nice about it?

485
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:34,612
How about the fact that he's dead and
you're alive. Alright how many got out?

486
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:39,363
Two, maybe three.
You're not going to catch them now, Wax!

487
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:51,577
How much time you think would
take to run down nine floors of stairs?

488
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:54,830
I have no idea, Wax?
- Maybe about six seconds a floor?

489
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:56,802
That sounds right?
- Yeah sure.

490
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,642
Now take 54 seconds.

491
00:51:00,814 --> 00:51:03,348
To get down there.

492
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:18,640
And five seconds to cross the lobby.

493
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,978
And four seconds to get to the car.

494
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:40,354
And then there was nothing.

495
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:48,115
The cops will be here soon.

496
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:50,012
Damn this place is chirping with Intel.

497
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:51,013
C'mon help.

498
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,234
Come on!

499
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,775
Hey Reece,
- We need to get out of here Wax.

500
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:54,462
Get in here. Check this out.

501
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,736
I don't want anything more to do with
this place Wax!

502
00:52:56,837 --> 00:52:58,437
- Well you got more to do with this
than you think.

503
00:53:10,738 --> 00:53:11,838
What the fuck?

504
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,877
Yeah that was what I was wondering.
- Why? You suddenly run out of explanations!

505
00:53:15,178 --> 00:53:16,462
You don't know where this is heading?

506
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,796
I'll just following the bouncing
ball right now that leads to you.

507
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:22,739
I got nothing to do with this Wax.
Well that's not what the evidence tells us.

508
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,553
Let's go. C'mon let's go!

509
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:36,246
They're heading to the tenth floor. The
door's rigged. They'll be blown to pieces.

510
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:37,380
NO!

511
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:38,803
It's not a fucking option you go out there.

512
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:40,304
You go out there and drag us into it.
It's over.

513
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:42,080
They are just a bunch of cops doing
their jobs.

514
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,181
We don't finish our job, thousands of people
are getting killed. You got that.

515
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,950
That's the point. We're supposed
to protect people not let them die.

516
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:49,957
Look! There's no time for a body
count. It's too late.

517
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:52,354
It's not too late for them.

518
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,575
Reece!
- Yes!

519
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,206
Get up.

520
00:54:29,672 --> 00:54:31,287
Reece! Police car. Get in.

521
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:42,803
Wait! wait, wait stop I've got to get
my stuff

522
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,504
- They knew we were coming, I'm sure
it's checked by now.

523
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:45,990
Look! My prints were all over that car.

524
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,060
The cops will trace it back to the embassy
and to me in no time.

525
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:53,483
Okay let me get get... Let me get
my head around this...

526
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,065
You want to stop in the middle of our getaway

527
00:54:55,066 --> 00:54:58,386
so you can grab your plates, wipe
your prints and grab some files!

528
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,293
I'll be quick...
Alright quicker than this!

529
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,987
Wax, wax, wax no!

530
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,238
What the fuck Wax?
- A fucking boom.

531
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,024
Work for you?

532
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:19,059
You're fucking crazy.

533
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:33,843
You did good today Reece.
Help to save the world a little bit.

534
00:55:37,923 --> 00:55:41,132
Why don't you have a sit here
and reflect our eventful day.

535
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:44,062
I'm going to shoot the shit with
these trench coats.

536
00:56:06,492 --> 00:56:08,771
What's the deal with the bag?

537
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:12,854
What they got in this bag, will get me
killed one day.

538
00:56:12,894 --> 00:56:15,442
You look pretty bulletproof to me.

539
00:56:15,477 --> 00:56:17,991
Reece, every man has got his vices.

540
00:56:17,992 --> 00:56:23,713
And in my case the locals call my vice
"A Royal with cheese".

541
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:34,319
So the job's finished?
We can go home?

542
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,918
Not till the trench coats call us and
tell us we can.

543
00:56:39,278 --> 00:56:43,514
What if it's never over, Wax?
What if we can't beat these guys?

544
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:47,265
Why don't you ask the guy you
shot what it feels like to win?

545
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:53,796
I didn't shoot him. I couldn't pull
the trigger.

546
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:57,182
I know you didn't.

547
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:59,977
But it's okay, it's not going in your report.

548
00:57:00,937 --> 00:57:04,100
Well maybe it should.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

549
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:06,790
No! That's exactly why you need to stay
in it. Keep your eye at me honest.

550
00:57:08,147 --> 00:57:10,325
You don't need me. Wax!

551
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:14,594
Oh! You fucking kidding!
Tell them we are not a perfect pair.

552
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:30,793
Dinner?
- Why the hell not.

553
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:44,310
I brought my friend Charles for dinner.
- Hi, Nicole.

554
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,558
Where have you been all day?

555
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,534
So you have to tell me something. What do you
do when you're not making men's jaw drop?

556
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:00,228
Working with girls
from the red light district.

557
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:03,472
So what the hell were you thinking
taking Reece to some hooker.

558
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:05,924
Didn't you know they got engaged last night.
- Sure!

559
00:58:05,925 --> 00:58:10,274
Talked about it all day.
I'd had to pick up a fabric shipment...

560
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:13,444
You know I'm a rag importer.
We got a little business on the side

561
00:58:13,445 --> 00:58:17,012
but you know I spend most of my money
on cars and women.

562
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:19,836
Not in that order I hope.

563
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:20,848
{ CELL PHONE RINGING }
-Excuse me.

564
00:58:21,175 --> 00:58:22,040
Yup.

565
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:22,863
Got to go change okay

566
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,408
Hold on.

567
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,297
Yeah I'm listening.

568
00:58:45,977 --> 00:58:47,150
Alright so!

569
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,297
Where were we?

570
00:58:48,398 --> 00:58:51,881
You were telling my friend what clothes
my fiancée was picking up when I saw you.

571
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,004
Ah well I am not really in the clothing
business.

572
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,366
I'm actually in the cloak and dagger
division of the embassy.

573
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,028
Like my boy here.
Mostly cloak!

574
00:59:03,062 --> 00:59:06,432
Mostly dagger.
- Hmm! Killed anyone today?

575
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:07,733
{ LAUGHING }

576
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:11,394
Oh let's see. About bout one an hour
average? I'd say...

577
00:59:13,286 --> 00:59:15,554
And what type of people did you
kill today? James.

578
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:17,597
You know, the usual. Bad guys.

579
00:59:18,678 --> 00:59:22,260
Bad guys, baldest ass suicides destined,
cold hearted Pakistanis,

580
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:26,161
motherfucker the south of Karachi.

581
00:59:27,494 --> 00:59:31,276
Now, wow! Seriously I mean we took down
a whole terrorist cell today. Tell them!

582
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:34,947
That's what we were doing in
the elevator when you saw us.

583
00:59:34,982 --> 00:59:36,259
Truth.

584
00:59:37,651 --> 00:59:40,299
He's been modest.
Tell us how you saved the day.

585
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:42,948
I helped.
- Did you at least catch them all?

586
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:46,705
Not sure, but
we'll find out soon enough. Alright!

587
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:49,401
Let's party.

588
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:01,498
What did you think that was?

589
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,695
I like this girl!

590
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,714
Excuse me.

591
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,280
Hello?

592
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:15,907
No I'm sorry, there is no Rose here.

593
01:00:18,902 --> 01:00:20,560
Wrong number.

594
01:00:22,346 --> 01:00:25,426
That's the call we've been waiting for.

595
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:30,630
What the fuck? What the fuck Wax?
- Shut the fuck up and you listen to me.

596
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:35,393
Rose was a codeword. Nicole's number on
every Pakistani cell phone that we found.

597
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:38,055
She's a Pakistani you stupid fuck
doesn't mean she's a terrorist!

598
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,806
It does when she's your best friend and you
got him living in an apartment that's bugged?

599
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:43,290
What the hell are you talking about Wax?

600
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:46,426
Yeah I'll show you what I am talking about.
You stay right there! Don't you fucking move!

601
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,908
Watch this.

602
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,210
There. Here.

603
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:02,203
How much you want to
bet she's got a dozen buried around here?

604
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,406
What? You were the one who rented
the apartment!

605
01:01:07,895 --> 01:01:10,890
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!
Before we started dating...

606
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:14,192
I had her completely checked.
She's totally clean, Wax!

607
01:01:14,227 --> 01:01:17,493
What? You have me checked out?
- Obviously not enough.

608
01:01:17,494 --> 01:01:20,189
She's working for the fucking people who
took your picture man!

609
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:23,044
I don't believe you.
You've got the wrong girl! Wax!

610
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:23,276
You'll got the wrong girl!

611
01:01:23,311 --> 01:01:26,632
What do you wear what they gave you?
- Nothing.

612
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:29,614
Your ring, man! That's how they've
been tracking us!

613
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:33,878
C'mon give it over, I'll prove to you. I'll
give you my gun. Give me the fucking ring.

614
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:36,107
Give me the ring, give me the fucking
ring I'll prove it to you.

615
01:01:37,263 --> 01:01:39,023
Don't, please. Please.

616
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,614
Don't you dare. Don't you dare point
that at me. You point that at her.

617
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,577
Alright this'll how it works.

618
01:01:57,678 --> 01:02:01,578
If there's a transmission in the ring,
it'll interfere with the stereo. See That!

619
01:02:11,062 --> 01:02:12,587
Why, Caroline?

620
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,047
Reece, you good?
- My shoulder.

621
01:02:27,048 --> 01:02:29,518
I told you that fucking chick will
get you killed!

622
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:45,168
Volvo, green, 92MPR75.

623
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:10,593
Ump! There's one more.
- There you go 17 microphones.

624
01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:12,760
Five cameras, two in your bedroom.

625
01:04:12,785 --> 01:04:15,407
That's impossible, Caroline couldn't even
screw in a light bulb.

626
01:04:15,408 --> 01:04:17,727
They'll never put these shit in if they
didn't knew what they were doing.

627
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:20,850
Hope you got some good moves on you
buddy boy if it gets on YouTube.

628
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,665
I fucked up.
- No, you're just in love man.

629
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:33,440
Love is always a bitch.
- Yeah! What do you know about love?

630
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:35,421
Well, once in Congo, twice in Beirut.

631
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:38,794
Same girl. I isnt made of stone.
No matter what you think.

632
01:04:41,452 --> 01:04:44,620
C'mon think about it, where could she be?
Family, friends...

633
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:47,717
She never talked about her life.
And I never thought to ask.

634
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:50,095
I don't know anything about this girl. Wax?

635
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:54,160
How did I miss this?

636
01:04:54,195 --> 01:04:57,883
I need word on that Volvo,
We need to find this girl.

637
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,305
Got it? You're on.

638
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:11,800
Hello. - Please don't bother tracing
I will be off in a minute.

639
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,109
I'm sorry it came to this, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

640
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:17,939
You need to understand.
- Then help me.

641
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:22,453
Because I don't know what the hell's going
on. Just tell me the truth Caroline.

642
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:36,179
Six years ago I met a man
who opened my eyes to his fate.

643
01:05:36,573 --> 01:05:38,956
And finally for the first time in my life...

644
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:41,339
everything made sense.
I knew I had a purpose.

645
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:46,254
To lie to me?
To shoot me?

646
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:48,432
To serve my cause.

647
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:54,222
And living with me and spying on me?
That was all part of your plan?

648
01:05:55,842 --> 01:05:58,759
Caroline? Caroline!

649
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:03,133
She's gone. Did you get a lock on it?

650
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:07,898
No it's too short. It's okay. Play it back.
Crop her voice down, bring up the background.

651
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:48,024
Six years ago I met a man
who opened my eyes to his fate.

652
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:49,877
Good, good, louder, louder.

653
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:52,655
And finally for the first time...

654
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:55,118
everything made...
- Where is that?

655
01:06:55,468 --> 01:06:57,533
Could be... could be the peripherique.

656
01:06:57,568 --> 01:06:59,758
They're leaving Paris, where're they going?

657
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:02,215
Ambassador Bennington.

658
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,613
Yes, sir.
- God damn what are you doing?

659
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:07,301
The delegation just landed. Reece.

660
01:07:07,602 --> 01:07:10,102
Why the hell aren't you at the airport
to greet them?

661
01:07:25,304 --> 01:07:27,773
The American delegation just
landed for the U.S. Africa Aid summit.

662
01:07:27,808 --> 01:07:29,843
They're going to hit the delegation.
Who's driving? That would be me Sir.

663
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:32,100
C'mon let's go.
Move quick!

664
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:32,944
Wait a sec.

665
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:35,675
Is that it? Don't you want to think
about this for a second, Wax?

666
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,791
You think about it, you're the chess player.

667
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:05,164
Ohhh... I love this song.

668
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:13,675
Don't you say anything about this.
It's between us.

669
01:08:58,223 --> 01:09:00,549
Are you okay sir?
Huh?

670
01:09:00,584 --> 01:09:04,899
I don't know. Something's wrong here.

671
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:06,393
It doesn't make sense.

672
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:11,068
If they wanted to hit the delegation,
then why did they wire THIS apartment?

673
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:14,062
Why they use me?

674
01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:24,107
All Paris bound lanes have been blocked off.
We will be there in a few minutes.

675
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:28,054
Nah those fuckers on strike on the freeway,
they shouldn't be far.

676
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:35,018
There he is. Go! GO! Floor it!

677
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:49,019
{ TYRE SQUEKING }

678
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,920
{ TYRE SQUEKING }

679
01:10:31,003 --> 01:10:33,130
This isn't going to slow him down.
Do you have any heavy metal?

680
01:10:33,131 --> 01:10:34,546
How about this?

681
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:40,163
Ohhhh... Come to daddy.

682
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:07,440
African aid summit
come together in Paris, France

683
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,563
Closer!

684
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:39,463
I'm a little busy, Reece.

685
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:42,096
She is not inside that car.
- What?

686
01:11:42,193 --> 01:11:45,354
What are you talking about. I can
see her in the passenger seat.

687
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:48,515
Listen to me she is not inside that car.

688
01:11:48,611 --> 01:11:51,396
She is entering the summit
as a delegate.

689
01:11:51,533 --> 01:11:54,869
What? Are you sure?
Because I can see her from here.

690
01:11:58,174 --> 01:12:00,649
Wax, wax! the Volvo was probably
a diversion.

691
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,589
Make sure you get a visual contact,
Before you take your shot.

692
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:06,679
Move closer. I got to look inside!

693
01:12:14,517 --> 01:12:16,310
Ah fuck you're right. She's not there.

694
01:12:16,311 --> 01:12:18,930
Shit I'm on my way to the summit.
- Okay yeah, I will be behind ya!

695
01:12:19,026 --> 01:12:20,776
I got to clean this shit up.

696
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:49,851
Have them turn the motorcade around!

697
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:56,866
Yes?... Excuse me, Madam...

698
01:12:57,131 --> 01:13:01,089
There's Intel there's a potential threat.
They want us to change our course.

699
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:04,399
Negative.

700
01:13:05,372 --> 01:13:07,682
Is he done?

701
01:13:25,062 --> 01:13:28,109
Pass them up. Get me on the bridge.

702
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:12,986
Come on, baby. One shot.

703
01:14:18,908 --> 01:14:22,823
Get down! Now! Get down!

704
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:58,535
Welcome to Paris, baby.

705
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,947
Excuse me
- Excuse me

706
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,789
Wax! Look she's probably wearing one
of those shock activated vest.

707
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,790
- Like the ones we found in that apartment?

708
01:15:19,923 --> 01:15:21,411
No way, she wouldn't do that.

709
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:23,822
The bitch isnt going to the summit to make
some speech. Reece!

710
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:27,332
If I can find her. I'll talk to her.
- Yeah, she'll blow your fucking head off. OK!

711
01:15:27,365 --> 01:15:30,084
Now you'll going to have to aim up high,
where there's no vest.

712
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:31,114
Do you understand what I am saying?

713
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:33,849
Do you fucking understand what I'm saying!

714
01:15:34,306 --> 01:15:36,176
Okay I got it.
- Good.

715
01:15:36,272 --> 01:15:40,729
Talking isnt going to do the job man.
You'll going to have to take that shot.

716
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:41,700
Damn.

717
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:50,189
Access denied
- I'm sorry sir, I can't let you in.

718
01:15:50,222 --> 01:15:52,724
Can you please try again sir.

719
01:15:54,168 --> 01:15:58,066
Sir? this card has already used by
Ambassador Bennington's assistant.

720
01:15:58,162 --> 01:16:02,094
That's impossible. I am Ambassador
Bennington's personal aid.

721
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,932
Please come with me sir.
- Look I can explain this.

722
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:07,858
I think my girlfriend stole my card
to get into the summit...

723
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:10,500
If you'll just give me a minute.

724
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:13,421
Ambassador Bennington!

725
01:16:13,454 --> 01:16:16,150
What in fool's for God's sake, he's
my personal aid!

726
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:19,165
Give me that.
- Where the hell have you been?

727
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:21,760
Are you aware of what happened
to the delegation on the freeway?

728
01:16:21,856 --> 01:16:24,695
I need to talk to you right now sir.
- So what is going on?

729
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:25,696
{ ALARM ON }

730
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:26,997
Weapon!

731
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:33,577
Reece, since when did you carry a gun?

732
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,565
There's a suicide bomber inside the Embassy.

733
01:16:36,661 --> 01:16:38,745
There's been absolutely no Intel on that.

734
01:16:38,846 --> 01:16:41,046
- I'm telling you. You need to clear
this conference. Right now.

735
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:45,384
I can't shut down the summit on the vague
assumption... - This is not an assumption.

736
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:48,622
I know the bomber. Sir.
She's my fiancée.

737
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:53,596
Your fiancée?
- She's been using me as a cover all along.

738
01:16:56,642 --> 01:16:58,347
Are you sure she is in here?

739
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,937
No, I'm not.

740
01:17:04,672 --> 01:17:07,403
Mr. Ambassador, the delegates are
about to arrive.

741
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,609
Let him go.
- Not with a weapon.

742
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:14,685
Thank you, sir.
- Excuse me.

743
01:17:16,086 --> 01:17:18,086
Excuse me

744
01:17:19,187 --> 01:17:21,187
Excuse me
-Please

745
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:47,158
Caroline!

746
01:17:49,059 --> 01:17:51,059
Excuse me

747
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
Caroline !

748
01:18:07,861 --> 01:18:09,861
Situation control

749
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:15,462
Don't  you fucking move !
Don't you fucking move !

750
01:18:15,638 --> 01:18:18,061
Get down Sir!

751
01:18:18,096 --> 01:18:20,484
Get down!

752
01:18:21,428 --> 01:18:23,364
Drop the weapon Sir!
- Caroline!

753
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:27,078
I need you to drop the weapon sir!
- Caroline! Don't move.

754
01:18:27,174 --> 01:18:31,250
I do not want to do this. I do not want
to shoot you.

755
01:18:31,283 --> 01:18:34,748
I need you to lay your weapon down now Sir!

756
01:18:37,941 --> 01:18:41,885
Lay your weapon down Sir!

757
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:46,682
Put your weapon down Sir!

758
01:18:49,718 --> 01:18:52,254
Drop the weapon!

759
01:18:52,255 --> 01:18:53,955
{ ALL SCREAMING }

760
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:57,823
No, no, no! Do not shoot! That vest
might explode.

761
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:07,708
Caroline, please...

762
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:10,178
Let me help you.

763
01:19:13,676 --> 01:19:16,211
I don't need any help.

764
01:19:18,368 --> 01:19:21,642
I am in peace.

765
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:26,022
Caroline, this isn't peace.

766
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:33,258
You told me before that the reason you did
all this is to find some kind of purpose.

767
01:19:34,654 --> 01:19:36,701
Try to make sense of it all.

768
01:19:38,366 --> 01:19:41,116
Well, That's all I want too, Caroline.

769
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:46,564
No, no, please. Don't do this.

770
01:19:46,599 --> 01:19:48,573
Just listen to me.

771
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:52,906
Just for a minute. Just listen to me.

772
01:19:57,272 --> 01:20:00,801
Nothing else in the world matters
right now Caroline,

773
01:20:01,558 --> 01:20:04,764
except I love you.

774
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:08,119
And that's all I have.

775
01:20:09,656 --> 01:20:11,990
Love for you.

776
01:20:18,585 --> 01:20:21,499
And even if you don't love me...

777
01:20:21,534 --> 01:20:25,781
that's all the sense any of us is ever
going to get.

778
01:20:28,028 --> 01:20:30,038
Love.

779
01:20:30,605 --> 01:20:33,473
Love.

780
01:21:50,758 --> 01:21:54,582
What the hell is going on? I didn't fly 10
Firkin hours to get my ass melting in this limo.

781
01:21:54,678 --> 01:21:56,258
I'm sure it's for your own safety madam.

782
01:21:56,459 --> 01:21:59,459
- You always say when you don't have
a clue about what's going on.

783
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:05,249
Wax, Wax! For Christ sake's. Would you please
explain what's going on.

784
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,246
Excuse me, madam. I'm very sorry.
There's been a security problem...

785
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:11,055
that's been handled and you're free to go.

786
01:22:11,089 --> 01:22:12,822
Have a nice evening.

787
01:22:16,374 --> 01:22:20,589
I want to know who's responsible for
this delay and I want him fired.

788
01:22:23,799 --> 01:22:27,926
That's what I like about the job.
You get acknowledged, you get compliments.

789
01:22:33,876 --> 01:22:37,919
Here, I got you a little something to keep
you going. Wherever it is you are going.

790
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,049
Yeah?

791
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,450
{ LAUGHING }

792
01:22:41,312 --> 01:22:42,147
Yeah, man.

793
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:43,824
You know I got this sense...

794
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,729
that you're going to take your act on
the road pretty soon here.

795
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:49,535
Courtesy of the very appreciative
government.

796
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:53,627
But I must tell you that I won't be a guest
if you're coming with me.

797
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:58,380
I got to get back to the apartment Wax.
Got so many things...

798
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:01,369
that apartment's been, packed up
and shipped out.

799
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:03,558
But I think I know what you are looking for.

800
01:23:12,222 --> 01:23:15,791
Something to remember her by.
- Thanks, Wax.

801
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:19,361
let's play a little chess game
before I go.

802
01:23:19,362 --> 01:23:21,912
I thought you were the kind of guy who
didn't like playing chess?

803
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:24,324
I lied. Sue me.

804
01:23:24,325 --> 01:23:27,254
Okay, but I going to warn you I don't
take prisoners.

805
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:30,184
Well I'm going to warn you! I am a
Very sore loser.

806
01:23:31,162 --> 01:23:34,075
Okay well if that's the case.
- No shit!

807
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,676
Yeah, man.

808
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:41,025
Damn, welcome to the club. Pard! - Oh, you
are going down, you are so going down.

809
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,430
Listen Hoss! Let me tell tell you something.

810
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:46,531
What I actually got about this game,
you won't even learned yet.

811
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:47,532
{ LAUGHING }

812
01:23:47,516 --> 01:23:50,386
Really?
- Yeah, I'm just talking.
