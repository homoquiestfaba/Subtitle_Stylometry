1
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,800
(The Good-hearted Daughter)

2
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:31,396
My mother-in-law urged that Older Sister and I

3
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,131
should leave back to our original clans

4
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:40,164
because she is returning to her husband's clan.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,609
This is why Older Sister is returning

6
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,607
to her parents' clan today.

7
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,004
We became sisters

8
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,550
because we married into the Vang family.

9
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,419
Our sisterhood has just begun,

10
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,784
and yet we are already parting.

11
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,623
Now that you are leaving,

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,025
please remember me.

13
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,863
I'm thankful that we had the chance to be sisters.

14
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,663
Though we must part,

15
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,533
I'll always keep you in mind.

16
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,005
Older Sister,

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,274
I hope that we'll meet again someday.

18
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,150
Younger Sister, because you are crying,

19
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,718
I don't want to leave.

20
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,844
Then I won't cry anymore.

21
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:34,354
You should go now so you can reach
your parents before nightfall.

22
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,525
As for me, I followed my mother-in-law.

23
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,826
AfterOlder Sister's departure,

24
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,094
my mother-in-law and I traveled

25
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,262
into the northern lands

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,840
of her husband's clan.

27
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,916
At the rooster's first crow

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,279
I must rise to prepare breakfast.

29
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:11,386
I must fully dress before I begin any work.

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:47,323
I prepare food not only for us,
but forouranimals too.

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,660
Vegetables are chopped and boiled to feed
my hogs every morning.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,306
I don't let them eat food that is not fresh

33
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,840
because my mother-in-law and I count them
as ourfamily members.

34
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,014
They are all we have now.

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:13,485
Back then, we also had cattle and horses,

36
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,154
but now Mother-in-law and I have
only this hog and herpiglets.

37
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:22,735
As new arrivals in these lands, my mother-in-law
and I have no fields of ourown.

38
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:27,399
As new arrivals in these lands, my mother-in-law
and I have no fields of ourown.

39
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,667
Everyday, I must work in the fields of the local
villagers in orderto receive food.

40
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,864
Today, I'm working for Lady Zong Chue.

41
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,450
Even though my mother-in-law is not well,
I must find work in orderto feed us.

42
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,003
It's so hot today.

43
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:44,706
Yes it is very hot. Because you don't work everday
like me, you aren't as burnt.

44
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:49,944
People wouldn't even recognize that I'm Hmong
if I went into the city.

45
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,554
Both of you should stop talking.

46
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,957
We might not finish cutting these rice stalks
before nightfall.

47
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:11,741
In this village, Xi is the closest relative of my
husband.

48
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,132
Sister-in-law, you've returned from the fields?

49
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,274
Yes.

50
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,435
Mother, you don't seem well at all.

51
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,743
You've returned already?

52
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,971
Yes, I'm home.

53
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,816
Mother, eat.

54
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,389
What about you?

55
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,391
Let me feed you first, then I'll eat.

56
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,908
I can't eat anymore.

57
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,380
Have one more spoon, Mother.

58
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,889
No more.

59
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,358
Just one more spoon, Mother.

60
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,190
No more.

61
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,390
Last one.

62
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,519
Today, I'm working for Nia Cha.

63
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,133
They are better off, so they have rice with meat.

64
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,802
But I only supplement my rice with peppers.

65
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,821
After toiling an entire day in the field,
we come to collect ourpay.

66
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,694
The workers labor formoney,

67
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,094
but I do it for rice.

68
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,447
I thought they would fill up my basket,

69
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,753
but it wasn't what I had hoped for.

70
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,839
Here are some herbal medicine.

71
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,508
Chop it up and let it sit in cold water.

72
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,177
Then have your mother-in-law drink it.

73
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,348
After that, scrape her fingernails and toenails.

74
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,982
How much should I chop?

75
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,451
It's very bitter, so only chop a small amount.

76
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,119
Alright.

77
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,688
Also, here is a bundle of leaf medicine.

78
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,157
Crush them and wrap them around your
mother-in-law's wrists and ankles.

79
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,024
These will stop fevers.

80
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,959
How much should I crush?

81
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,534
Divide that bundle into three separate uses.

82
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,866
Alright then. I'll be on my way.

83
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,575
See if the herbs help. If they don't, let me know.

84
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,210
Alright.

85
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,641
Goodbye.

86
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,911
Thank you, Aunt.

87
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:34,431
I hope that the herbal medicines Aunt Za gave me

88
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,294
will help my mother-in-law get well.

89
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,623
Mother, lets have you sit so I can give you
medicine.

90
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:08,575
I wonder if these leaves can actually help.

91
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,541
I might not get better.

92
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,013
If I'm gone, what are you going to do?

93
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,983
Mother, you'll get well soon.

94
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,087
You must remain by my side.

95
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,786
Mother, drink this.

96
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,261
It's quite bitter, so take your time.

97
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,678
The elders believe that after taking medicine,

98
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,080
fingernails and toenails must be scraped

99
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,717
so the illness will subside quicker.

100
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,862
In a little while, I'm going to wash our clothes.

101
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,164
All done, Mother.

102
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,132
You can rest.

103
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,438
Once a week I wash our clothes.

104
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,242
Every time I come to the river I'm alone.

105
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,145
Fortunately, today,
there is a village woman here too.

106
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,809
Let me help you wash.

107
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,649
I can do it myself, you probably have other
errands waiting.

108
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,287
I'm actually not in a hurry.

109
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,190
Thank you.

110
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,498
Since you often work in other people's fields,

111
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,363
you might consider trying Lady Zongkai's farm.

112
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,700
I hear villagers say the pay is quite good.

113
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,874
Really? I've never worked in their fields before.

114
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,003
You should look into it.

115
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,465
Your load looks heavy, let me carry some.

116
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,694
Don't mind me, I can do it myself.

117
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,300
It's alright, you're pregnant, so let me help you.

118
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,977
Afterour initial meeting that day,

119
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,620
that lady I became closely acquainted.

120
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,591
And I also went to work in Lady Zongkai's fields.

121
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,983
Miss, I've never seen you before.

122
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,090
Where are you from?

123
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,695
I just moved from Muang Loung to this village.

124
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,587
I see.

125
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,537
Are you Aunt Va Cha's daughter-in-law,
Brother Seng's wife?

126
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,502
Yes.

127
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,768
Oh, really!

128
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,569
My name is Pao Choua.

129
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,771
When Brother Seng and I were young,
we used to play together.

130
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,642
Our ages were only slightly apart.

131
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,718
But since Auntie and Uncle Va Cha took brothers
Seng and Chai and moved from here,

132
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,718
we never met again.

133
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,331
Tomorrow, all of you must help me again.

134
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,374
That's if you still really need us.

135
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,277
If you all don't come,
how can I finish the work here?

136
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,578
Why didn't your parents come today?

137
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,788
They are tending our other rice field.

138
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,484
You have quite a small family to own these
many fields.

139
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,489
Who did you work for today to have received so
much rice?

140
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,964
I went to work for Aunt Zongkai.

141
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,736
Oh, Aunt and Uncle Zongkai.

142
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,796
They are never selfish.

143
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,313
They are distantly related to us,

144
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,444
but back when we lived in this village,

145
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,983
our family had a more loving relationship with them
than with our closely related kin.

146
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,283
Were Aunt and Uncle Zongkai there today?

147
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,957
They didn't come.
Only their son Pao Choua came.

148
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,026
Oh, Pao Choua.

149
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,627
He is their youngest son.

150
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,565
He was very talkative as a child.

151
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,707
Is he still like that?

152
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,893
From now on, don't work in anyone else's fields

153
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:34,369
except in Zongkai's because I know their family
very well.

154
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:45,605
A long time ago our family owned many fields...

155
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,442
...had wealth...

156
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,018
...and hired many laboring hands just like them.

157
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,418
Our lives were filled with joyful abundance.

158
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,253
We had no worries.

159
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:15,702
If my son was still here,
you wouldn't have to work so hard.

160
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,359
Even though I don't speak of my husband,

161
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,295
I always think about him.

162
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,311
When my husband was still alive,

163
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,177
he would always help me gather
vegetables forthe hogs.

164
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,878
Those who are orphans,

165
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,416
or widows like me,

166
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,180
will sing our sorrow into a poetic hymn.

167
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,434
My heaven,

168
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,170
my husband.

169
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,865
Is this a good year...

170
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,678
...or an unfortunate year...

171
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,152
...that in my leaving...

172
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,055
...I arrived in these lands.

173
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,896
But the mountains are unlike my own,

174
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,265
the valleys also unlike my own.

175
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,406
Everybody is coupled,

176
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,808
everyone is paired...

177
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,843
...they walk hand in hand,

178
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,312
working side by side.

179
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,589
But I have no one,

180
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,885
I am not paired...

181
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:17,724
...so I make my sorrowful life...

182
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:26,266
...like the lost squirrels and birds.

183
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,827
My heaven,

184
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,760
my husband.

185
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,025
Is this a good year...

186
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,937
...or an unfortunate year...

187
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,804
...that in my leaving...

188
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,475
...I arrived in these lands,

189
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,152
But the valleys are unlike my own,

190
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,450
the mountains also unlike my own.

191
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,931
Everyone is paired,

192
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,336
everybody is coupled...

193
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,571
...they walk hand in hand,

194
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,672
they work side by side.

195
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,279
But I have no one,

196
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,953
I am not paired...

197
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:54,921
...so I make my sorrowful life...

198
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:03,333
...like the lone squirrels and birds.

199
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:08,240
My sadness and regret...

200
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:12,005
...is like the far-off hermit field.

201
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,777
In this lifetime,

202
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,448
I bear the weight of reluctance...

203
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:26,191
to be my parents' daughter...

204
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,197
...with a lifelong wait for death.

205
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,861
Mother, I'm going to grind these corn.

206
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,227
Remember to drink your medicine.

207
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,890
Yes.

208
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:08,024
It'll probably take you a while to grind
because there is no one to help.

209
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,054
I'll take my time, Mother.

210
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,929
Sister, the two of you are also grinding corn today?

211
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:03,236
I don't understand why Sister Xi didn't respond.

212
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,642
Come, let's go.

213
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,314
We're done now, so we'll be on our way.

214
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,544
Alright then.

215
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,816
To use the grinder properly,

216
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,543
one person must grind, the other must feed.

217
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,487
But because I work alone,

218
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,152
I grind a lot of corn at once.

219
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,492
It takes me a long time to finish.

220
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,957
Hello, Pao Choua.

221
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,601
Hi, Auntie.

222
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,698
What errand brings you here?

223
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,467
Oh, I've brought you some rice.

224
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,077
Daughter, come accept this sack of rice from
Pao Choua.

225
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,811
I'm sorry.

226
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,352
Pao Choua.

227
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,251
The sack is heavy so can you help carry it inside?

228
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,850
Have a seat, son.

229
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:46,929
I still have some errands to run so I'll be on my way.

230
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,564
You should stay awhile.

231
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,029
I'll come again when I'm not too busy.

232
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,460
Do visit soon.

233
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,433
Alright.

234
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,433
There is no firewood nearby to gather,

235
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,867
but going faralone to find wood can be scary.

236
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,333
Gathering wood is a man's job,

237
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,802
but it doesn't mattertoo much if I do it.

238
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:43,584
The villagers who come this farclaim to have seen
tigers and ghosts,

239
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,984
but I haven't seen any,

240
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,991
and I don't want to either.

241
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,229
These wood are really tough.

242
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,997
I'm not too strong, so this is a real challenge.

243
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,604
I'm so exhausted.

244
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,807
Being alone so much, I talk to myself a lot.

245
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,210
I've been gone a long time,

246
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,708
I wonder how my mother-in-law is doing at home.

247
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,608
She must be worried about me.

248
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,015
I've got to hurry in order to carry some water
before nightfall.

249
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:36,515
Carrying wood might seem more exhausting
than carrying water, but it is not.

250
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,558
Water is much heavier.

251
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,657
Hello, Pao Choua.

252
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,621
Hi, Auntie.

253
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:09,890
Come inside.

254
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:10,584
Alright.

255
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,223
I haven't been feeling well the last few days

256
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,697
so I haven't had the chance to visit your parents.

257
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,767
How are they?

258
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,993
They are well.

259
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,571
Auntie, my father killed one of our cattle today
so I've brought you some meat.

260
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,176
You shouldn't have.

261
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,941
I brought only a small portion.

262
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,030
Sit, Son.

263
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,664
I'm a little busy, so I'll be on my way.

264
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,405
How come you're always bringing us food?

265
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,008
You don't have to be ashamed,

266
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,109
I know you like my daughter-in-law.

267
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:20,962
If you ever decide to marry her, I wouldn't mind.

268
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,425
This year the two of us may not celebrate the
New Year like others.

269
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:02,805
It doesn't matter. Next year, we'll celebrate.

270
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,245
Mother, when you have the strength,

271
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,809
will you mind cutting out some paj ntaub designs

272
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,081
for me to embroider?

273
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,184
You're so preoccupied with work,

274
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,484
yet you still want to embroider paj ntaub?

275
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,420
I can sew during leisure moments between work.

276
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:42,634
During the New Year celebration,
every family makes rice cakes.

277
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,114
Rice cakes are prepared by the men.

278
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:52,077
My mother-in-law and I won't have any
for the New Year

279
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,120
because we don't have sweet rice

280
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,054
and helping hands.

281
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,539
Mother, who brought these firewood?

282
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,340
Pao Choua brought them.

283
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,490
So, I guess where having rice cakes
for the New Year.

284
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,201
Because we are new here,

285
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,466
we don't have our own cornfield yet.

286
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,075
We've asked to use corn from Pao Choua's family

287
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,678
to feed our animals.

288
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,526
We also gather green vegetables
from Pao Choua's farm.

289
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,928
I don't feel comfortable with Pao Choua
helping us so much.

290
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,704
But since we arrived in this village,

291
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:30,545
none of my father-in-law's close kin
have offered us anything.

292
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,957
Mother, take off your shirt.

293
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,788
Mother, why are you smiling so much today?

294
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,096
I'm just happy for no particular reason.

295
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:03,332
Mother, you must stop accepting things
from Pao Choua.

296
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,735
If he brings them, how can I refuse?

297
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,441
Mother.

298
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:34,762
I'm so old, I don't know how long I have with you.

299
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:43,208
I want someone to replace me

300
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,013
before my eyes are closed.

301
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,144
Mother, don't speak like that,

302
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,484
I don't want to hear such words.

303
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,424
I only speak of the truth.

304
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,857
I cannot do what you wish for me to do.

305
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,760
Why won't you begin your life again?

306
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,139
So I won't worry so much.

307
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,078
If I begin a new life,

308
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,111
I will have new parents,

309
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,512
I will not be able to bring you with me.

310
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,278
You know well this is our custom.

311
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,451
I will never leave you.

312
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,616
As I've told you before,

313
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:34,062
I am your people,
in life and in death.

314
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,649
I still have two rice fields at Straw Mountain.

315
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,059
One for sweet rice, the other for plain rice.

316
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:12,262
I also have a cornfield in the highlands.

317
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:15,733
These fields have not been worked for many years.

318
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,375
Now the soil is ready for cultivation.

319
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,609
The widow field will not produce...

320
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,115
...let the jungle blossom in its place...

321
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,653
...and ready the soil for swidden farming.

322
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:51,439
Mother, you're old, but your eyes see clearly

323
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,566
and your hands are quicker than mine.

324
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,980
I don't know, I just work faster.

325
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,011
You do see things before me.

326
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:06,985
The one who should see works slower.

327
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,385
I don't know.

328
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,140
I must prepare some rice for
the New Yearcelebration.

329
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,246
Although there is only two of us,

330
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,479
we'll still celebrate like others.

331
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,883
Why does my mother-in-law always insist
that I start a new life?

332
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,554
She is always ill.

333
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,451
I wonderwhat I would do if I lose her.

334
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,287
You need to stop bringing things to our house.

335
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,185
You've already helped us enough.

336
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,559
My giving are only acts of communal kinship.

337
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,632
The reason why I've called you clansmen today

338
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,938
is to talk about Brother Seng's wife.

339
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:51,570
Uncle Va Cha, Brother Seng,
and Brother Chai have died,

340
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,310
leaving behind three widows.

341
01:00:54,917 --> 01:01:00,822
Sister Chai has returned to her clan,

342
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,458
but there are still two widows.

343
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,855
There is no one to take care of them.

344
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,396
That is why...

345
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,093
I've called this meeting.

346
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,871
Among us, I am their closest kin.

347
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,366
So I'm proposing to marry Sister Seng
as my second wife.

348
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,012
That's why I've called upon you all.

349
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,408
In regards to your proposal,

350
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,916
we are all not as close as kin to them as you.

351
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,554
We don't know what to say,

352
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,579
simply because you already have a wife.

353
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,649
Perhaps you must first ask her

354
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,694
to see if she's willing to marry you.

355
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,956
To you clansmen,

356
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:45,796
regardless of my daughter-in-law's decision,

357
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,369
I am unwilling to accept such a proposal.

358
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,804
You clansmen know well how good
my daughter-in-law is.

359
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:01,312
Although I have no son as a husband for her,

360
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:05,717
I have the will to find her a worthy man

361
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,617
before my eyes have closed.

362
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,021
Aunt.

363
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,453
You're old and unwise in these matters.

364
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,085
You shouldn't speak like that.

365
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:19,091
Since our arrival here to follow the clan,

366
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:24,665
none of you have been able to offer
us a single meal.

367
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:31,241
except for the fact that my daughter-in-law must
toil your fields in order to support us.

368
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,974
Now that you've seen her,

369
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:39,147
you clansmen talk of kinship and community!

370
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,790
If this is what you've called me to talk about,

371
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,589
I have nothing else to say.

372
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:39,537
Mother!

373
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,921
I told you that I should have accompanied you.

374
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,729
What did the clansmen talk about?

375
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,879
Grandma, where is Sister Seng?

376
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,784
Her mother is very ill.

377
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:19,170
Panong Lee, I've given your mother medicine.

378
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,376
If your mother gets well, then all is good.

379
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:27,582
But if she doesn't, you might want to ask Aunt Za

380
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,744
who can sell you the right medicine.

381
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,845
Do you know how much she will charge?

382
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,358
She charges quite heavily.

383
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,956
I have errands to tend to, so I must leave now.

384
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:46,163
If your mother doesn't get well, let me know.

385
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,031
Thank you for bringing my mother some medicine.

386
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,635
Goodbye.

387
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:34,812
Mother!

388
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,151
Mother! What's wrong?

389
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:45,616
Mother, I will go fetch Aunt Za.

390
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,408
Aunt, Aunt, are you home?

391
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,536
Aunt, Aunt, are you home?

392
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,848
Oh, it's you.

393
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,212
Come in, come in, come in.

394
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:16,617
Aunt, I need some medicine for my mother.

395
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,791
You must explain her sickness,

396
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,191
else I won't know what to give her.

397
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,555
I don't know.

398
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,257
RIght now, her throat seems too tight.

399
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,765
She struggles to speak.

400
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,363
I beg you for medicine.

401
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,798
I'll do anything you ask,
even if I have to work for you.

402
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,375
Well, let me find it.

403
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:06,534
Here, boil this and have her drink it.

404
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,500
Thank you. I will remember this.

405
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,459
Where have you been?

406
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,024
Mother.

407
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,229
Mother.

408
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,325
Lift me up to sit, Daughter.

409
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,221
I have no strength left in me.

410
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,931
Perhaps I will not recover.

411
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,769
Daughter...

412
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:55,084
...I thank God that we had the chance...

413
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,882
...to be mother and daughter for a while.

414
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:14,132
I thank you for the love you've given me.

415
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:25,903
If only I could hold this moment...

416
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:33,087
...I would live with you a day longer.

417
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:45,032
I know well that if I'm gone,

418
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,596
...the clansmen would force you...

419
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:50,929
...to marry...

420
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,002
...Xi.

421
01:11:56,178 --> 01:12:00,012
I do not wish for you to be Xi's second wife.

422
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,844
Pao Choua...

423
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:10,088
I know that you love my daughter.

424
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,153
When I am gone...

425
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:18,024
...will you please marry her?

426
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,741
You must care for her and love her.

427
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,036
Do not let her suffer.

428
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,047
The two of you must love one another.

429
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:51,625
Mother!
