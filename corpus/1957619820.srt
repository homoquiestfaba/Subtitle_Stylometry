$5 for orange juice.

be much drinking

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,484
Stone fox.

186
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,153
She with you?

187
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,288
(laughs)

188
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,123
- That's my sister.

189
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,091
We're just bumming
around together.

190
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,460
She has this disease.

191
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,701
- Allow me.

192
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,271
Howdy, ma'am.

193
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,040
- Thank you.

194
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,546
(suspenseful music)

195
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,206
Barbara Brennan.

196
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,277
Barbara Brennan.

197
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,951
(screams)

198
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,419
- Mom.
(screaming)

199
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,521
Mom please just watch the road!

200
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,590
- Oh, oh!
- This is insane!

201
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,426
Just go for it.

202
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,661
- Go for it?

203
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,595
We're trapped!

204
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,897
Oh my god!

205
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,131
Is there a car over there?

206
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,033
- Mom, there are 100 of them.

207
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,134
- Why don't we forget
the car's registered

208
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,569
in my name and you drive?

209
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,638
- No mom this is great,
every man for himself.

210
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,605
Just go for it.

211
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,674
- Oh my god, shoo, move!

212
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,942
- [Megan] Mom.

213
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,176
Mom.

214
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,578
- Don't talk to me, I'm
trying to concentrate.

215
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,712
- Alright look out!
(honks)

216
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,114
Look out!

217
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,482
- Why are you yelling?

218
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,150
- Because Mom, this is
insane, this is insane.

219
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,385
- Will you stop yelling!

220
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,520
- [Megan] I don't
wanna die, okay?

221
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,821
- Calm down or I'll kill you!

222
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,890
- God, no wonder Dad
couldn't live with you.

223
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,025
- What?

224
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,593
What did you say?

225
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,130
- Mom just watch the road.

226
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,898
- That was a horrible
thing to say!

227
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,033
- Just watch the road!

228
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,334
- Why are you so hostile?

229
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,001
- Hostile?

230
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,070
I'm not hostile, I'm bored.

231
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,972
Oh my god we've
gone around again.

232
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,206
What, bored?

233
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,341
- [Megan] Mom let
me out of here.

234
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,842
- I had to work my
fingers to the bone

235
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,911
to pay for this trip
and you call it boring?

236
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,213
- Mom, I didn't want
this, this was your idea!

237
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,949
- You're going away to
school for two years,

238
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,583
I thought it would be fun!

239
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,418
- Fun?

240
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,519
This is crazy!

241
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,853
- Oh, now I'm crazy.

242
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,423
- Mom, look, I'm
transferring schools, okay?

243
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,425
I'm not entering
the foreign legion.

244
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,359
You're acting like
we're never going

245
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,260
to see each other again.

246
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,194
That's crazy.

247
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,595
- No.

248
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,297
Not crazy.

249
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,832
Wishful thinking.

250
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,735
- Fine, fine, I'm outta here.

251
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,870
Abandon me then, abandon me.

252
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,174
- Wait a minute!

253
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,008
Where are you going?

254
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:16,909
Get back in here.

255
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,210
- No.

256
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,680
- I've never abandoned
anyone in my whole life.

257
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,682
- What do you call this then?

258
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,017
- Megan.

259
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,320
(sighs)

260
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:43,936
(light music)

261
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,681
- You seemed a
little distracted.

262
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,349
I must be getting old.

263
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,650
- You?

264
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,385
(glasses clink)

265
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,652
Never.

266
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,921
I'm just...

267
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,792
- What is it, my little one?

268
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,360
Hmm?

269
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,763
Tell me what it is.

270
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,499
- Oh it's just...

271
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,202
It's just some awful
American women.

272
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,206
They crash into me in their car.

273
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,846
I have one of their
names written someplace.

274
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,789
They said they had insurance

275
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:41,660
but I was so furious I didn't
get where they were staying.

276
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,032
- I suppose I could
locate their hotel

277
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,601
if they are in Paris.

278
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,072
- No Bernard, that's
asking too much.

279
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,140
- You didn't ask.

280
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,443
- No not really.

281
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,879
It's just a private matter.

282
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,349
- And I'll do it.

283
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,118
Because I adore you.

284
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,987
Now come to me.

285
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,172
- Hi.

286
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,278
We still talking?

287
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,581
- Hmm.

288
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,317
I've had some time
to do some thinking

289
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,820
and I'm going to accept you
now as a responsible woman

290
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,025
and I agree that you have
every right to live your life

291
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,560
any way you choose to.

292
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,363
- Okay.

293
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,601
Listen I apologize for
what I said before.

294
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,638
- No need to apologize.

295
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,907
I've forgotten all about it.

296
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,741
- Good.

297
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,678
- Organizers claimed
the demonstration

298
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,981
as overwhelming success.

299
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,048
- You gonna change?

300
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,850
- To the equality of all people.

301
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,818
- For what?

302
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,087
- Well I thought we'd--

303
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,555
- Elsewhere today,
a gruesome discovery

304
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,857
in the shadow of Notre Dame.

305
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,859
A man was shot to death.

306
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,329
Police identified the
victim as Joaquin Prades.

307
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,099
Prades was the son of
a Panamanian diplomat

308
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,568
who was forced into
retirement last year

309
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,070
because of the family's
reputed connections

310
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,639
to the South American mafia.

311
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,207
- I want this to
be our vacation.

312
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,342
- Police will not speculate--
- Me too.

313
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,144
We'll do whatever you wanna do.

314
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,213
- [Reporter] Prades's father,
interviewed by telephone--

315
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,080
- Okay.

316
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,849
- [Reporter] Said he
was shocked and grieved.

317
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,817
He said that he hoped
his son's killers

318
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,452
would be brought to justice.

319
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,088
- Wait, Mom, the Moulin Rouge.

320
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,490
Isn't that a tourist trap?

321
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,992
I mean like a floor
show like Las Vegas.

322
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,261
- No, like Shirley
MacLaine in Can Can

323
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,331
or Jose Ferrer when he
played Toulouse Lautrec.

324
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,400
Besides, we don't have to drive.

325
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,601
- That's a blessing.

326
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,803
Hey, two American
girls out on the town.

327
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,471
Parisian men watch out.

328
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,940
(laughs)

329
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,746
(suspenseful music)

330
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,094
- [Barbara] The desk clerk said

331
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,930
it's two blocks down
and to the left.

332
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,932
Or is it to the right?

333
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,271
- Here we got French
fries being whipped up by,

334
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,909
I dunno, he's an
off-duty gourmet chef.

335
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,750
(speaking foreign language)

336
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,420
- Food food...

337
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,388
Oh, here we go.

338
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,392
On duty we have French business
women finalizing a deal.

339
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,561
- And somewhere there's
a Parisian mother

340
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,731
who wishes she'd kept a
closer look on her daughter.

341
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,665
- Mom!

342
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,967
- Put it down.

343
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,306
(speaking foreign language)

344
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,811
(suspenseful music)

345
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,286
I don't know if walking in
this part of town, oh my god,

346
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,887
is such a good idea.

347
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,491
- It's a terrible idea,
madame, mademoiselle.

348
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,159
Very much fun here.

349
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,427
Very nice here.

350
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,996
Very nice, beautiful
ladies, nice ladies.

351
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,299
- No we--
- Very special, very artistic.

352
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,334
No cover charge, no no no no no.

353
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,402
Okay?

354
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,636
- No, okay.

355
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,837
- You're American, I bet you!

356
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,640
- We are and we're--
- Yes, come in, come in!

357
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,442
- Hey!

358
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,310
(screaming)

359
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,512
(shouting)

360
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,818
Call the police, the police!

361
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,486
Oh my god.

362
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,325
(honking)

363
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,160
Call the police, something!

364
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,796
(screaming)

365
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,132
Police, somebody help us!

366
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,334
- What's the problem?

367
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,935
- Sir, please, call the police!

368
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,103
- Alright madam.

369
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,805
What's the problem?

370
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,173
- He is the police.

371
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,476
- Somebody took my purse,
a man took my purse.

372
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,577
- What man?

373
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,781
Can you describe him?

374
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,916
- Yes.

375
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,852
He was, uh, well...

376
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,890
He was wearing a gold
earring, I think.

377
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,093
- How much money did
you have in your purse?

378
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,229
- He didn't actually
take any money.

379
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,465
- What did your purse look like?

380
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,002
I see.

381
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,437
That's the purse he took?

382
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:54,706
- Yes.

383
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:56,708
- Yes.

384
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,481
(murmuring)

385
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:08,220
An unknown assailant
attempted to steal my purse

386
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,257
but was unsuccessful.

387
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,259
Is that it?

388
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,796
- It was an attempted robbery.

389
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,132
- I am attempting to help.

390
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,135
- Then why aren't
you chasing him?

391
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,337
- An unknown assailant--

392
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,940
- Thank you very
much for your help.

393
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,482
- Madame Brennan?

394
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,720
Here is the telephone
number of my precinct

395
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,488
with my extension.

396
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,524
If something more
concrete comes to mind,

397
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,726
please feel free to call me.

398
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,461
Voila.

399
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,867
- Voila to you too, buddy!

400
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,135
- Mom.

401
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,441
He was cute, wasn't he?

402
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,143
- That's enough for one night.

403
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,217
(dramatic music)

404
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,120
- Oh my god.
- Oh my.

405
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:29,534
(murmuring)
(phones ringing)

406
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,338
- Why do you suppose
the chief works so late?

407
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,943
Doesn't have to deal with
pickpockets and pimps anymore.

408
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,812
Why?

409
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,013
Hemery!

410
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,116
- Well I never thought about it.

411
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,686
- I'll tell you why.

412
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,920
Dedication?

413
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,689
No.

414
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,724
This is dedication.

415
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,393
Ambition.

416
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,729
And you know what?

417
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,464
I don't like him.

418
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,700
Have you ever seen
his lady friend?

419
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,934
- Nn nnn.

420
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,606
- What about the townhouse,
the country place, or the cars?

421
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,040
On his salary?

422
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,308
No.

423
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,543
His wife's money.

424
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,312
And I'll tell you what.

425
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,281
It's not fair.

426
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,583
It's not fair for one
man to have so much.

427
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,087
- Alibert.

428
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,154
- Me?

429
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,891
- Now.

430
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,633
(phone ringing)

431
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,637
- Oui?

432
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,772
Ah.

433
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,308
Madame Brennan.

434
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,944
(knocking)

435
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,215
Here I am.

436
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,791
- Is this concrete
enough for you?

437
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,304
- What is missing?

438
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,808
- A light summer jacket.

439
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,248
- We didn't see anyone and
neither did anyone else.

440
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,518
I checked with the desk clerk
and he spoke with the maid.

441
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,653
- Very good.

442
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,957
I take it you don't have jewels.

443
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,894
- Well I didn't bring any
with me when I came to Paris

444
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,395
if that's what you mean.

445
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,601
- I assume you're carrying
your money with you.

446
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,802
- Yes.

447
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,670
- That's why nothing was taken.

448
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,976
My best guess is that
you have been the victim

449
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,311
of two unfortunate
circumstances.

450
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,580
I'm sure these things
happen in America.

451
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,182
- Yes.

452
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,252
But not all the time
and everywhere we go.

453
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,189
This is not a coincidence!

454
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,257
And in America when a
citizen is in trouble,

455
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,259
the police actually try to help!

456
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,528
And even when the citizen
doesn't happen to be American

457
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,464
the police still try to help!

458
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,300
- Yeah.

459
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,067
(clock ticking)
(suspenseful music)

460
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,969
- [Daniel] You want
an investigation?

461
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,970
You've got it.

462
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,450
- Shall I dust the panties?

463
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,019
(shutter clicks)

464
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,453
I'm running out of film.

465
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,326
- Take your time.

466
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,236
Good job boys, I'll see
you're recommended for medals.

467
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,171
- [Alibert] A request will do.

468
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,017
- The room has been
thoroughly checked.

469
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,621
Your presence will no longer
contaminate the crime scene.

470
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,091
Therefore you may
return momentarily.

471
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,995
- Um--

472
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,196
- I need to
fingerprint you first.

473
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,130
- You what?

474
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,165
- Fingerprints.

475
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,937
I need to compare what I've
taken from the room to...

476
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,442
I need to fingerprint you.

477
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,584
- Alright, we're
humiliated, we're tired.

478
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,286
You've had a real good
time pushing us around

479
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,787
and you've kept us
up half the night.

480
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,822
Congratulations.

481
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:44,789
- Touche.

482
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,558
(suspenseful music)
(gasps)

483
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,425
- There he is!

484
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,927
- Who?
- The man!

485
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,263
The man who took our purse!
- Oh my god!

486
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,866
- Hey!
- Hey stop, stop!

487
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,368
(speaking foreign language)

488
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,903
- Stop him!
- Get him, get him!

489
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,139
(shouting)

490
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,544
(tires squealing)

491
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,880
- Stop, police, stop!

492
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,085
- [Daniel] Did you
get the license?

493
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,653
- No sir, the lights were off.

494
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,788
- Get on the radio.

495
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,593
(mysterious music)

496
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,633
I caused you a
great inconvenience.

497
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,636
I didn't take you
seriously enough.

498
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,207
Forgive me, madame.

499
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,043
- Apology accepted.

500
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,281
- Until I know what to
make of these events,

501
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,750
caution on your part is
certainly called for.

502
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,186
- Caution.

503
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,058
Is going back to Philadelphia
cautious enough for you?

504
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,661
- With your permission, madame,

505
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,597
we'd like to move you
to a different hotel.

506
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,066
A place where no one
knows where you are.

507
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,938
(speaking foreign language)

508
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,511
- Does this seem normal to you?

509
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,681
- Mom.

510
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,250
Why can't you just
relax and enjoy it?

511
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:24,289
Maybe the inspector knows the
manager's cousin or something

512
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,659
and he wanted you to
stay in a nice place.

513
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,229
'Cause he probably
has a crush on you.

514
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:37,101
- For a guy who started
out to be such a pill

515
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,572
he sure came a long way.

516
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,741
- You came on pretty strong,
I was kinda proud of you.

517
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,544
- Yeah?

518
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,749
Well, he did push all
the wrong buttons.

519
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,819
Of course he did apologize but

520
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,488
maybe we should have gone home.

521
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,391
(sighs)

522
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,161
- What, because of
a couple of mishaps?

523
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,132
- At least no one
knows where we are.

524
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,935
- That's right.

525
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,140
Goodnight, Mom.

526
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,209
- Night, honey.

527
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,313
- Day two.

528
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,915
Very nice.

529
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,516
The way things should be.

530
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,721
Very ritzy, very,
oh, there's Mother

531
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,124
looking very
stylishly undercover.

532
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,093
She's a little jumpy in
this high-rent district.

533
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,428
Thinks there must be a catch.

534
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,538
- Hi honey.
- Hi Mom.

535
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,008
Hey, things are looking up, huh?

536
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,245
- We should stay together.

537
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,613
Or the more I think of it.

538
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,216
We should leave Paris.

539
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,188
(suspenseful music)

540
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,429
What's wrong?

541
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,166
- Oh my god.

542
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,773
We were witnesses to a murder.

543
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,019
- Yes Captain Abrams, I
have spoken with Interpol.

544
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,756
And now I'm appealing to
the Philadelphia police.

545
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,525
Mm hmm.

546
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,028
No domestic violence.

547
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,598
No suspected addictions.

548
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,236
No no no, I'm not
suggesting anything at all.

549
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,071
Hmm?

550
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,506
Okay.

551
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,542
Let's get back to Mrs. Brennan.

552
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,813
Would a jealous lover
have any reason to...

553
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,183
Uh huh.

554
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,018
Parking tickets.

555
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,821
Moving violations.

556
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,589
(chuckles)

557
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,057
Lousy driver, eh?

558
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,329
Oh, mm, thank you very
much, Captain Abrams.

559
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,531
I do appreciate
your cooperation.

560
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,366
Bye.

561
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,237
Police business.

562
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,274
- You were checking up on me.

563
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,844
- I have to follow all leads.

564
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,482
- I got something you're
gonna want to check up on.

565
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,522
(suspenseful music)

566
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,102
Here, I'll rewind it.

567
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,004
You can look at it again.

568
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,655
Uh.

569
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,092
Oh and this slows it
down, frame by frame.

570
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,777
- I could tell fairly
well the man is

571
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,513
Prades, the Panamanian.

572
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,683
I didn't recognize the woman,

573
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,685
but I will be
crosschecking with Interpol

574
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,588
as soon as we can get a
good rendering to send out.

575
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,257
Obviously Commissaire,

576
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,526
it will be helpful if
we could see the tape

577
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,728
on a bigger screen.

578
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,166
- Yeah, okay.

579
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,935
Um it's pretty easy.

580
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,672
This works just like a VCR.

581
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:20,985
Oh I forgot, the French TV
system is different, um...

582
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,756
You have to get
the tape converted.

583
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,593
- I can take care of it.

584
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,228
With your permission.

585
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,067
- Madame Brennan, I sincerely
thank you and your daughter

586
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,236
on behalf of the French police.

587
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,439
I hope this matter has
not spoiled your vacation.

588
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,708
- Well I guess a
vacation isn't a vacation

589
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,843
unless something goes wrong.

590
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,478
That's why it's so memorable.

591
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:53,050
- The inspector said he put
you up in a different hotel.

592
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,552
It's satisfactory?

593
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,021
- Well.

594
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,125
We do feel safer.

595
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,828
- The Royal Monsoir.

596
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,863
I got them a special rate.

597
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:10,968
- Thank you.

598
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,114
(mysterious music)

599
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,389
- Maybe we could see like
a police lineup, oh my god.

600
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,458
Oh here.

601
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,394
- Yes, thanks, thank you.

602
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,765
Help you.

603
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,401
- Alright, let me get
a two-shot of you two.

604
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,770
- A two-shot.
- What?

605
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,904
- Listen it's not every day

606
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,073
I'm in a French police
station, alright?

607
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,343
- Actually call me Daniel.

608
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,344
- Barbara.

609
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,982
- Inspector.

611
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,817
Just pretend you're
persecuting her

612
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,819
over the parking
tickets or something.

613
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,688
- Okay.

614
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,223
(laughing)

615
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,492
- Hemery.

616
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,198
May I talk to you for a moment?

617
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,570
- Excuse me.

618
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,404
- Um...

619
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,019
I wonder if he has a girlfriend.

620
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,887
- Don't they all?

621
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:46,197
- Inspector, this matter
is not in our jurisdiction.

622
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,065
You can continue
looking after the women,

623
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,602
but I'll have to
hand the videotape

624
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,071
directly to the
brigade in charge.

625
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,139
- Yes?

626
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:56,841
But what about--

627
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,611
- You know how political
these rivalries are.

628
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:06,584
And I'll see to it you get
full credit in due time.

629
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,855
And I'll always remember
that what you've done

630
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,859
honors our old precinct.

631
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,098
- What's wrong?

632
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,936
- Someday he'll be
minister of the interior

633
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,005
and I'll still be here.

634
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,043
He took the tape, told
me to drop the case,

635
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,879
keep my mouth shut and
just look after you.

636
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,082
- Hardship duty, huh?

637
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,486
- Oh no, no, I mean...

638
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,790
A pleasure, most certainly.

639
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,145
- Darling, what--

640
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,314
- I thought you
might enjoy a movie.

641
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,149
- A movie, but, but...

642
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,185
A movie?

643
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,756
- Converted from this
home video taken by

644
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,225
some awful American women.

645
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,326
- What?

646
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,329
- Going away?

647
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,535
No time for a nice dirty movie?

648
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,270
- But listen--

649
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,373
(slaps)
(cries out)

650
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,110
- And this time don't
tell me about car crashes.

651
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,045
Don't ever lie to me again!

652
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,186
- Do you know who
Joaquin Prades was?

653
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,621
- A vile man.

654
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,757
And you were kissing
him like a slut.

655
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,891
Like his lover.

656
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,992
- Yes!

657
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,027
At one time I was.

658
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,630
In a former life,
a horrible life.

659
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,402
When I came to you for help
with my residency card,

660
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,705
didn't you ever wonder
what I did in Panama?

661
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,473
Who I was?

662
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,909
Where all this money came from?

663
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,844
Don't look away!

664
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,579
You always look away!

665
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,982
- I live only for the moment.

666
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,519
I thought I loved you.

667
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,458
- Bernard.

668
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,593
If you love me,

669
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,297
you have to know me.

670
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,435
I faked my own death
and I took money.

671
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,004
A lot of money.

672
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,108
Enough to come here
and create a new life,

673
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,310
but not enough to buy happiness.

674
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,014
That's what you brought.

675
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,587
Three years of happiness
and I'd do anything Bernard,

676
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,722
anything to save that!

677
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,625
- And you, you killed this man.

678
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,094
- It was an accident!

679
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,698
Would you like me to submit
to a man like that again?

680
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,367
- Dear god.

681
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,269
This is not the right tape.

682
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,575
- Is this a cruel joke?

683
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,948
- But in my office I saw.

684
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,651
Hemery gave me the
evidence himself!

685
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,193
- He kept the real tape.

686
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,031
Then he will talk.

687
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,602
And I will die.

688
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,572
Because Prades people
will hunt me down.

689
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,541
- Hemery gave me the wrong tape.

690
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,278
- He must already know who
I am, my connection to you.

691
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,381
He is trying to set us up.

692
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,883
- Us?

693
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,552
All I did was help
to find these people.

694
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,288
(suspenseful music)

695
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,323
- I'm in this up to my neck.

696
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:14,899
And you, my darling, you're
in this up to your heart.

697
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,433
Don't you see?

698
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:21,205
You work so hard to
get where you are.

699
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,909
You have so much
to look forward to.

700
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:32,383
It would be terrible
to lose it all now.

701
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,953
When all you did was love me.

702
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,825
We have to get the tape.

703
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,695
And if your inspector
and his American friends

704
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,264
can identify me
without the tape.

705
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:53,938
Oh, Bernard, we have
to get the tape.

706
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,640
We have to get them.

707
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,313
Where are they?

708
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,187
- Come on let's go.
- Ronnie, wait for me.

709
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,488
What's the rush?

710
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,193
(murmuring)

711
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,106
(laughs)

712
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,185
(speaking foreign language)

713
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,221
- Daniel.

714
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,889
(speaking foreign language)

715
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,594
- Hello.
- Hi.

716
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,296
This is Luc.

717
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,698
He's gonna show me
the sewers of Paris.

718
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:58,202
Like in Les Miserables
where Jean Valjean escaped.

719
00:43:58,902 --> 00:43:59,737
- Monsieur.

720
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,838
- The sewers, eh?

721
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,640
- Yes, or the flea market.

722
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,508
Atmosphere, you know?

723
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,044
- You are throwing me
over for a younger man?

724
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,847
I had my heart set on
taking you out today.

725
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,148
We should stay together.

726
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,617
- Well I've seen
enough tourist stuff.

727
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,486
- Perhaps we can
all go together.

728
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,489
- I'll see what's
keeping my mom.

729
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,556
Excuse me.

730
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,695
Mom!

731
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,729
- Yeah?

732
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,966
- Mom come on,
everybody's waiting.

733
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,336
Listen I met this guy
at breakfast okay so

734
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,539
be nice if you could act
like you sort of like him.

735
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,775
Okay?
- I'll give it a try.

736
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,377
- Oh Mom, not pants.

737
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,614
A dress, something
soft and clingy.

738
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,449
- You're telling me
about soft and clingy?

739
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,485
You wore chrome and hot
leather to the prom.

740
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,522
- Mom I think
Daniel would like it

741
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,023
if you wore some heels.

742
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,293
Typical.

743
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,432
- You suppose that's
what your father thought?

744
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,467
- What?

745
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,769
- When we had that
fight in the car

746
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:09,106
you said you knew why he left.

747
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,108
- Well who cares?

748
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,577
There's someone waiting
for you downstairs.

749
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,478
- He can wait.

750
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,982
This is important.

751
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,252
- Well not to me it isn't.

752
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,555
- You're a lot like him.

753
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,558
- What's that supposed to mean?

754
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,561
- And the more he
wanted to leave,

755
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,696
the more I tried to keep him.

756
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,766
(sighs)

757
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:39,903
- Look I talk to him
maybe once a month, okay,

758
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,638
and that's if I call.

759
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,007
I get a birthday
card on a lucky year.

760
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,242
I don't know why he left,

761
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,777
I don't know what
he thinks about you,

762
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,879
I don't even know what
he thinks about me.

763
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:51,281
Okay?

764
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,853
- The problem was between
your father and me.

765
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,455
It wasn't your fault.

766
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,094
- Look.

767
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,465
What's past is past.

768
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:16,140
So why don't we just
try and forget him?

769
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:24,982
Oh god.

770
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,217
Mom.

771
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,286
I gave Daniel the wrong tape.

772
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,341
- Bonjour.

773
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,309
- Hello.

774
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,280
Oh, Megan gave you the
wrong tape yesterday.

775
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,347
This is the right one.

776
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,083
They got switched somehow.

777
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,055
I suppose you're gonna have
to take it to the station?

778
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,456
(laughs)

779
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,158
- I think the owner
of the precinct

780
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,526
can wait a few hours.

781
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,728
My chief was very clear.

782
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,665
My orders are to watch you.

783
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,667
Here they are.

784
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,168
- Oh Luc, this is my mom.

785
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,670
- Hi Luc.
- Shall we go?

786
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,504
- Yeah.

787
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,941
- [Daniel] Flea market
is very spread out.

788
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,676
Do you mind a lot of walking?

789
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,010
- I love walking.

790
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,079
Yesterday I was
just telling Megan

791
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,982
how can you see Paris
unless you walk?

792
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,386
(speaking foreign language)

793
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,388
- It's called a flea market
because of the vermin

794
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,891
that infested the
secondhand goods.

795
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,126
The turn of the century
they still had cases

796
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,928
of bubonic plague.

797
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,030
- Mom, here, take
a picture of us.

798
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,132
Just look through the
viewfinder, push that red button

799
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,234
right there.

800
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,635
- Okay.
- Okay.

801
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,638
- Let's see, why don't
you, hold on, over here.

802
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,007
Okay, excuse me, I'm
gonna get right in here.

803
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,610
Okay.

804
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,445
Now stand still.

805
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,483
Oh, day three.

806
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:11,321
Philly coed braves black
death with real Frenchman.

807
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,624
- [Megan] What are you doing?

808
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,293
- It's movies, I'm moving it.
- Mom.

809
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:18,896
- [Barbara] Smile.

810
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:22,833
- Oh look.

811
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,636
Okay wait, here Mom,
hold my bag, hold my bag.

812
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,803
- Okay.

813
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,940
He is a cutie.

814
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,112
(singing in foreign language)

815
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,232
- God, did you see those hats?

816
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,809
- Those look great on you.

817
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,017
- Ooh, that one's great.

818
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,390
What do you think?

819
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,224
(laughs)

820
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,492
- [Luc] Fantastic.

821
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,194
- Mom'll die.

822
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,131
- Escargot, that's the
only French I know.

823
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,700
(laughing)

824
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,236
- I'm glad we came here.

825
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,844
I don't get to flea
markets much back home.

826
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,080
Probably because there aren't
any flea markets back home.

827
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,348
(suspenseful music)

828
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,149
I hear they've got some
great ones in New York,

829
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,617
I mean among other things.

830
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,222
- [Luc] You're talking too much.

831
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,824
- [Megan] New York's probably
where I'm gonna end up.

832
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,693
There's no way I'm gonna
stay around where I live now.

833
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,504
- We'd better find them.

834
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,606
- Okay, I'll check
back this way.

835
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,141
- Alright, I'll
meet you back here.

836
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:11,975
- Okay.

837
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,518
- [Megan] Nearly
there, just a sec.

838
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,121
- [Luc] Let me see you.

839
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:27,657
- [Megan] Like it?

840
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:35,132
- Lovely but you
should keep quiet.

841
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,247
- Megan?

842
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,151
- No, no, no, no!

843
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,021
- Oh my, oh my!

844
00:50:58,688 --> 00:50:59,890
- No, no!

845
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,858
No!

846
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,394
- Megan!

847
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,929
Help!

848
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,064
Daniel!

849
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,067
Megan!

850
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,103
(dramatic music)

851
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,174
- No, no, please god!

852
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,978
(shouting)

853
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,280
Oh god!

854
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,222
No!

855
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,128
- Oh, oh!

856
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,133
Megan!
- Hey!

857
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,668
Hey you, stop!

858
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,237
You, stop, police!

859
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,038
Get off!

860
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,507
- Hey, hey!

861
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,585
- Madame Brennan,
please follow me.

862
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,420
- What have you
done to my daughter?

863
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,421
- Walk.

864
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,223
You'll find out soon enough.

865
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,960
(groaning)

866
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,542
(honking)

867
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,586
(gun fires)

868
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,002
- Hey!

869
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,237
(speaking foreign language)

870
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,405
Give it back!

871
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,541
- Where did the lady go?

872
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,708
- That lady?
- Yeah.

873
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,045
- A guy with a gun, a
silencer, grabs her.

874
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,580
- What guy?
- What's going on?

875
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,447
- What guy?

876
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,052
Where is she?

877
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:09,986
- Gone.

878
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,556
She got away.
- Where?

879
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,391
What did the guy look like?

880
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,725
Where did they go?

881
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,994
- You're the police,
how do I know?

882
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,436
(radio static buzzing)

883
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,439
(suspenseful music)

884
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,217
- Move!

885
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:41,718
Move!

886
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,020
- I've told you what I know!
- Move, move!

887
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,555
- My bike!
- Move!

888
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,524
(explodes)

889
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,293
(screaming)

890
00:53:55,932 --> 00:54:01,538
(singing in foreign language)

891
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,643
- Police!

892
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,411
Somebody!

893
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,948
Somebody help me, police!

894
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,483
Police!

895
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,619
Please sir, stop.

896
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,687
Telephone, telephone!

897
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,329
(honking)

898
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,498
Hold it, hold it!

899
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,602
Oh, oh!

900
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,876
(phone ringing)

901
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,748
- Hello, oui?

902
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,983
- Inspector Hemery.

903
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:47,951
Is he there?

904
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:49,953
- He's off-duty.

905
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,155
- No, no no, he was with me!

906
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,857
- Oh Madame Brennan.

907
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,525
- Has he reported in?

908
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,193
- That he was with you?

909
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,796
- No, about my daughter.

910
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,767
Please, please, I must
speak to the commissaire.

911
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,336
- Well I don't know if--

912
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,838
- For god's sake,
this is an emergency!

913
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,906
- Alright.

914
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,944
- Why hasn't he
reported the kidnapping?

915
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,981
Why aren't the police
looking for my daughter?

916
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,818
- Obviously Inspector Hemery
is still giving chase.

917
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,354
And now you've reported
the kidnapping.

918
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,324
So remain calm.

919
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,993
I'll send a man for you at once.

920
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,662
Where are you?

921
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,064
- I don't know.

922
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,067
They must want the tape.

923
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,469
Where am I?

924
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,539
- You have it then?
- Sir.

925
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,940
Where am I?

926
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,344
- Does Inspector
Hemery have the tape?

927
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:51,047
- Sir, where am I, where am I?

928
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,016
- Do you see a street sign?

929
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,184
- Here, talk to him.

930
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,518
- Hello, hello?

931
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,221
- This is a police matter.

932
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,523
Give me the location
of the phone booth.

933
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,493
- No monsieur, no monsieur,
I have done nothing.

934
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,362
My immigration papers are good.

935
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,296
- No.

936
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,798
No he doesn't understand you.

937
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,901
Please, okay, thank
you, thank you.

938
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:15,372
- Just get a taxi and we'll
meet you at the Royal Monsoir.

939
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,574
(dramatic music)

940
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,076
- They knew were we were...

941
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,979
You.

942
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:30,587
You knew where we were staying.

943
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,189
- Madame Brennan.

944
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,525
- And Hemery too.

945
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,161
- Madame Brennan!

946
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:50,540
- Taxi.

947
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,174
- Metro?

948
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,709
- Yes, fine, where?

949
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,614
(mysterious music)

950
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,617
(breathing heavily)

951
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,241
- Pretty legs.

952
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:35,318
If you call out, no
one will hear you.

953
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,591
But if we hear you,

954
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,497
we'll gag you.

955
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:51,167
So it's up to you.

956
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,929
(phone ringing)

957
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,333
- Oui?

958
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,667
- Bad news.

959
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,636
One of them got away.

960
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,806
- The tape?

961
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,809
- I have the camera
but not the right tape.

962
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,043
- I'll get back to you.

963
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,716
Your friend is an idiot.

964
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,518
- He's not my friend.

965
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,953
I have no use for friends.

966
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:47,290
- You, you stay with the girl.

967
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,360
We still need her, damn you.

968
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,928
Understand.

969
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,631
Can he be trusted?

970
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,402
- More than him.

971
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,731
(dogs barking)

972
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,538
- You're the one.

973
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,508
You're the one I filmed.

974
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,912
Listen I swear I'm not gonna
say anything to anybody--

975
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,114
- Be quiet.

976
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,118
Who has the tape, Megan?

977
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,335
Would you prefer Briot
to ask the question?

978
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,006
- I don't know who has the tape.

979
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,215
I gave the tape to my
mom and she was gonna

980
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:23,953
give it to the inspector and
I don't know who has the tape.

981
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,198
- Next time.

982
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,255
- [Daniel] Barbara.

983
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:00,189
- Stay there.

984
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,792
Where is Megan?

985
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,128
- How did you get in?

986
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,095
- The landlady.

987
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,731
- Why the gun?

988
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,734
- Because one, you and Vandelle

989
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,770
were the only ones who
knew where we were staying.

990
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,039
Two, Luc was sent to our hotel.

991
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,241
Three, whoever wants the
tape will keep Megan alive

992
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,075
until they get it.

993
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,344
Four, you better have
the tape or five,

994
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,980
I will blow your head
off because Megan

995
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,683
is the most important
thing in my life.

996
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,917
That's why.

997
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:32,622
Uh uh!

998
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:36,492
Slowly.

999
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,199
- I also suspected my chief.

1000
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,605
If I hadn't, when I
got back to my car...

1001
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,542
You saw me go after Megan.

1002
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,443
- Nice act.

1003
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,079
Quit stalling.

1004
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:58,281
Where is she?

1005
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,417
- I don't know.

1006
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,619
I don't know why Vandelle

1007
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,688
is involved in
kidnapping, murder--

1008
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,689
- Save it.

1009
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:07,924
Be quiet!

1010
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,561
- My car was blown up.

1011
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,330
- Go to the phone.

1012
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,232
- They wanted to kill me.

1013
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,468
- Go to the phone!

1014
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,004
- Barbara, this has
gone far enough.

1015
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,239
I am on your side.

1016
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,142
- I want you to call
the American embassy.

1017
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,276
- And?

1018
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:32,348
- They'll keep the tape
until I get my daughter back.

1019
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:37,053
- Right now, the fewer people
who know about the tape,

1020
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,124
the more likely it is
that Megan will live.

1021
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,860
- The phone.

1022
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,776
Don't try anything.

1023
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,649
- I thought you knew me.

1024
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:12,421
When you call your embassy,
they will get in touch

1025
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,090
with my government.

1026
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,160
Is that what you want?

1027
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,731
- I want my daughter.

1028
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:23,766
(sobbing)

1029
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,369
I want my daughter.

1030
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,673
(guns cocking)

1031
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,680
(knocking)

1032
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,419
- Oui?

1033
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:48,124
(guns firing)
(screaming)

1034
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,228
Go go!

1035
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,098
Follow me!

1036
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:00,336
(dramatic music)

1037
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,545
Follow me, quick.

1038
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,858
- Luc.

1039
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,064
- Next door, next door.

1040
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,777
(screaming)

1041
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,781
(guns firing)

1042
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,842
- Your gun!
- Forget it.

1043
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,243
You've got yours.

1044
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,177
- It's a toy!

1045
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,345
- Oh no!

1046
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,550
(guns firing)

1047
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:31,193
Go!

1048
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,771
- They're coming, go!

1049
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,112
- Don't think about it.

1050
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,947
Just follow me.
- Okay.

1051
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,034
(groaning)

1052
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,538
- Jump, jump, jump!

1053
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,044
(crying out)

1054
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,848
My arm, oh!

1055
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,384
- Oh my god!
- Oh it's broken.

1056
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:04,186
- Oh!

1057
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:10,326
(guns firing)

1058
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,733
- The gun, you
know how to use it?

1059
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,602
- No.
- You better learn.

1060
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,807
(gun fires)

1061
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,248
(guns firing)

1062
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,621
Run!

1063
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,588
Run!

1064
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:40,923
Go, run!

1065
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,400
- They went this way, let's go.

1066
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,272
(suspenseful music)

1067
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,608
(train whistle blowing)

1068
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,642
(guns firing)

1069
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:50,693
- No!

1070
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:06,475
Are you okay?

1071
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,010
- Give me the gun!

1072
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,246
(groaning)

1073
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,156
(guns firing)

1074
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,133
(shouts)

1075
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,211
Quick, let's go!

1076
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,681
Go, go!

1077
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,743
(crying out)

1078
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,947
I can't go farther.

1079
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,582
I have to stop.

1080
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:21,617
- Sit over here.

1081
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:28,791
Sit.

1082
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,599
- It needs to be set.

1083
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,571
I've got a knife in my pocket.

1084
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,047
(ripping)

1085
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,251
Help me.
- Let me help.

1086
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,257
- Do you know first aid?

1087
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,227
We need splints.

1088
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,463
Do you know splints?

1089
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,198
- Yes.

1090
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:11,667
Oh.

1091
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:34,323
- You pull until it
snaps into place.

1092
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,593
And don't let go.

1093
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:38,594
Okay?

1094
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,232
Harder.

1095
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,867
- I can't.

1096
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,735
- Yes you can.

1097
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:47,803
Okay.

1098
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,271
Tell me about Megan.

1099
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,741
- She's not what she seems.

1100
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,078
She hides so much.

1101
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,249
I feel like I'm the only
one who can protect her.

1102
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,618
- Love of god, pull!

1103
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,953
- But I'm doing a lousy job.

1104
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:06,522
- Harder.

1105
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,091
- No I can't!

1106
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,794
(snaps)

1107
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,825
Maybe we should get
you to a hospital.

1108
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,793
- [Daniel] I can't
trust my chief.

1109
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,930
We don't have the luxury
of trusting anyone else.

1110
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,498
Just do it.

1111
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,638
(smashes)

1112
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,274
(alarm blaring)

1113
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,984
- Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1114
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,290
- We need your keys because
this is an emergency.

1115
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,107
(mysterious music)

1116
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:35,911
- Hello my pretty
little American.

1117
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:39,848
It's just you and me here now.

1118
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,121
- Where did you get that?

1119
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:48,257
- [Briot] Smile for the camera.

1120
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,562
- What did you do to my mom?

1121
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,466
Don't hurt my mom.

1122
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,601
- Smile.

1123
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,636
- Oh god.

1124
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,274
Just let us go home.

1125
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:09,244
We'll leave France and we'll
never say anything to anybody.

1126
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,351
Did you hurt my mom?

1127
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,389
Oh god, stop it.

1128
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:26,361
- Maybe I should drive.

1129
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,297
- How?

1130
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,165
- Where are we going?

1131
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,601
- Where does your chief live?

1132
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,704
Which way?
- Fifth exit.

1133
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:36,939
(honking)

1134
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:41,443
Oh you're good at this.
- I've had practice.

1135
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,349
(honking)

1136
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:04,333
- There might be
an alarm system.

1137
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:06,935
- I'll be careful.

1138
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:33,061
Psst psst.

1139
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:34,997
Bark.

1140
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:39,535
Come on Toto, woof woof.

1141
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:41,670
Woof!

1142
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,306
(barks)
(cries out)

1143
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,575
(barking)

1144
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,690
- Uh oh Alban.

1145
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,059
In or out?

1146
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,028
Hmm, what's it to be?

1147
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:10,198
(suspenseful music)

1148
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,395
(clock ticking)

1149
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,834
- What in god's name?

1150
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,268
- Commissaire.

1151
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,271
- How did you get in here?

1152
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,840
- I have something you want.

1153
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,576
And I want my daughter.

1154
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,880
So if you'll just
follow me outside

1155
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,550
we can discuss the exchange.

1156
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:39,154
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1157
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,889
- Yes you do.

1158
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:43,392
Otherwise the tape
is on the news.

1159
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:47,729
- Okay.

1160
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:48,964
I need to get dressed.

1161
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,264
The joke's over.

1162
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,598
Where is Hemery?

1163
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,167
(gun cocks)
- Right here.

1164
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,903
You son of a bitch.

1165
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,871
Give it to her.

1166
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,712
- You said you had the cassette.

1167
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:44,319
- Uh uh.

1168
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,222
Someone has my daughter.

1169
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,961
- I'll see that the
cassette gets delivered

1170
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,362
to the proper person.

1171
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:57,299
And then your daughter
will be set free.

1172
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,233
- Sure.

1173
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,837
- What choice do you have?

1174
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,507
- We can kill you right now.

1175
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,213
- I know you, Inspector.

1176
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,982
You are too good a policeman

1177
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:16,051
to shoot a man in the back.

1178
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,687
Especially your commissaire.

1179
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,088
- Yes?

1180
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,669
- And I'm a mother, Barney.

1181
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:39,407
Does this thing have to
be cocked or something?

1182
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,778
- You pull the trigger.

1183
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,095
- You still lonely
for your mama?

1184
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:08,737
Or maybe for your
boyfriend back home?

1185
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:16,978
I bet a cute girl like you
has plenty of boyfriends.

1186
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,181
Dozens of them, maybe.

1187
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,116
Am I right?

1188
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:28,356
Maybe I could be your boyfriend.

1189
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,130
Soft skin.

1190
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:40,068
You see, I can be very gentle.

1191
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,374
Most people think
I'm just a tough guy.

1192
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:52,247
But feel how gentle I am.

1193
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:57,152
Do you think you could like me?

1194
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:59,321
- That's enough.
(gasps)

1195
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:06,394
- What's happened,
where's my mother?

1196
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,255
- [Daniel] What's the layout?

1197
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:38,460
- Main room, kitchen,
four bedrooms, and
a bath at the rear.

1198
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,095
- Where's Megan?

1199
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:45,166
Asked you a question.

1200
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,903
- I don't know, I didn't
take care of that.

1201
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,373
- How many are we up against?

1202
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:52,507
- Three.

1203
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:03,618
- Move.

1204
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,261
You make a sound, kill you.

1205
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:24,906
Ready?

1206
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,241
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1207
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,781
(suspenseful music)

1208
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,548
I don't see Megan.

1209
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,156
We don't know where she is.

1210
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,761
- Just get me into the house.

1211
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:53,895
- Okay.

1212
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:54,996
Let's go back.

1213
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,236
- Haven't you
waited long enough?

1214
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,241
No contact, no tape.

1215
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:09,110
They could have an entire
SWAT team closing in on us.

1216
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:11,613
- Alright.

1217
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,015
It's time to get out of this.

1218
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,353
Take care of the girl.

1219
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:21,356
(suspenseful music)

1220
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,645
(groaning)

1221
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,090
- Hungry?

1222
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,229
Thirsty?

1223
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,235
Have to go to the bathroom?

1224
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:13,007
Light on or off?

1225
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,092
- Where are they?

1226
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,093
- Who?

1227
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,063
- Hemery and the Brennan lady.

1228
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,131
- But where?

1229
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,499
- In the house!

1230
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,300
Get me loose.

1231
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:53,281
(groaning)
(laughing)

1232
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:13,334
- Luc.

1233
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,439
Put the gun on the table.

1234
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,976
(gun fires)

1235
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:31,386
- I'm sorry.

1236
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,556
I'm sorry.

1237
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:36,357
I'm sorry.

1238
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:37,759
- Constancia.

1239
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,796
Constancia!

1240
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,998
What are you doing?

1241
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,700
(struggling)
- No!

1242
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,701
No!

1243
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,468
(laughing)

1244
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,536
Stop it!

1245
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,538
Get off of me!

1246
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,374
Get off!

1247
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,377
Stop it!

1248
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,415
Get off!

1249
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:04,852
(hits)
(shouting)

1250
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:09,958
- Are you okay?

1251
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,829
- Stop, stop!

1252
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:18,866
Constancia, Constancia, stop!

1253
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,740
My feet, ah!

1254
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:32,280
(gun fires)

1255
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,382
Constancia!

1256
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,514
Constancia?

1257
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:22,864
(crying out)

1258
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,408
Constancia?

1259
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:47,555
(solemn music)

1260
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:55,596
- Why, Vandelle, why?

1261
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,073
- I loved her.

1262
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,677
- She was just scenery.

1263
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,248
Two lovers kissing.

1264
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,556
We could have gone home,
nobody would have ever known.

1265
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:22,957
Nobody.

1266
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:44,212
(crying)

1267
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:52,120
(honking)

1268
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:28,089
Day five, roles reversed.

1269
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,324
Mother in second childhood.

1270
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,427
- Do you mind?

1271
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:38,766
- Megan, the Arc de
Triomphe is over there.

1272
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,967
- Come on guys.

1273
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,671
- Isn't this what got us into
trouble in the first place?

1274
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:48,409
- Arc de Triomphe, right.

1275
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:01,522
(light music)

1276
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,328
Way to go, Mom.

1277
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:11,399
- Oh.

1278
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:13,634
(laughing)

1279
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:19,474
