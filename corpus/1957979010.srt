00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,954
(gentle suspenseful music)

2
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:20,278
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

3
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:32,220
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

4
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:44,278
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

5
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:56,329
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

6
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:08,248
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

7
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,285
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

8
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:32,234
(gentle suspenseful music continues)

9
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:41,316
[Rebecca] Yeah.

10
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,876
Yeah, she needs to be on
set on Monday for that,

11
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,363
so make sure everything goes okay.

12
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:50,556
(birds chirping)

13
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,413
Okay.

14
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,574
Yeah, sounds good.

15
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:55,656
(John sighs)

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,880
Yeah, we just pulled up.

17
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,790
Yeah, it like two hours away.

18
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:01,386
(John groans)

19
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,026
Cool, okay, keep me posted.
- Come on,

20
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,050
it's time to unplug.

21
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,136
You're gonna love it.

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,296
Yeah, I, uh, I'll be here until Monday,

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,206
so service seems to be fine.

24
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,501
Um, just call me, let me
know if you need anything.

25
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:17,334
(John exhales sharply)

26
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:18,191
Yeah.

27
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,123
Okay, talk soon, bye.

28
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,333
Call if you need anything,

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,880
come on, baby, it's
supposed to be our time.

30
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,506
I love you and I'm very
happy to be here with you,

31
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,063
but just, just don't, okay?

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,963
All right. (zips zipping)

33
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:40,947
(Rebecca sighs)

34
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:43,176
See, isn't this great?

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,246
- Yeah, no, it's lovely.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,466
Thank you for doing this.

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,356
[John] All right,
especially for unplugging.

38
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,516
- John, you know this is just-
- Hey, no, seriously,

39
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,690
I meant that sincerely.

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,453
And as much as you can be
present, I'm appreciative of.

41
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:02,800
(alarm beeping) (door squeaking)

42
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:05,907
(gasps) Ooh, cute.

43
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,189
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

44
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:11,526
[John] Not bad at all.

45
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,786
Ah! (gasps) Baby.

46
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,643
Ah?

47
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:21,260
This is exactly what
I've been needing. (laughs)

48
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,408
- Baby.
- (laughs) Yeah?

49
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,215
I will tell you what
you've been needing.

50
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,929
Oh, boy! (giggles)

51
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:28,956
(Rebecca giggles)
- Drinks.

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,946
- Mm, music.
- On it.

53
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,820
[Rebecca] Okay.

54
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,176
[John] (sighs) Okay.

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,788
Glasses, glassware.
(birds chirping)

56
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:41,236
(wind whooshing)

57
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,260
(branches rustling)

58
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,849
(birds chirping)

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,004
[Rebecca] Wow, this is such a cute room.

60
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,246
Yeah, it is.

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,337
(Rebecca chuckles)

62
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:04,506
You know, we should do this
with Paul and Danielle sometime.

63
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,186
Like a, Like a couples getaway.

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,466
Yeah, it's a good idea.

65
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,583
But I'm glad that we get
to do this together first.

66
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:13,686
- Mm?
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,543
Me too.

68
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,333
Wait, should we break
in every room as we go?

69
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:23,916
- Ooh, is that a challenge?
- Maybe.

70
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,740
Maybe after you make a proper
cocktail, we can discuss.

71
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,956
(laughs) Wait, wait,
are you extorting me

72
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,816
for my cocktail making abilities?

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,676
That's kinda the only
reason we're together.

74
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,429
Is it? (Rebecca laughs)

75
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,356
(John sighs)

76
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,213
Mm.

77
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:41,496
(exhales sharply) I love it up here.

78
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,363
Yeah, me too.

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,786
Isn't there another bedroom downstairs?

80
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,616
Yeah, there's a few.

81
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,653
- Let's check 'em out.
- All right.

82
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,496
Didn't realize this
place had so many bedrooms.

83
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,386
Yeah, it's not bad.

84
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,766
Should I go grab our bags?

85
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,940
No, let's just chill and
have a drink for a bit.

86
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,979
- Perfect.
- Okay.

87
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:04,056
(sighs) Okay. You want another drink?

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,343
- Yeah.
- Cool.

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,596
Hey, do you remember
where you put the speaker?

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,020
Oh, it's in your backpack.

91
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,223
Okay.

92
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,623
What'll it be?

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,073
- Um, surprise me.
(speaker beeps)

94
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:26,930
Okay.

95
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,013
Uh-huh.

96
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,566
(upbeat music) (Rebecca laughs)

97
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,753
Huh?
- You and this man.

98
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,003
You know you love it.

99
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:40,677
Ah, always makes me wanna cook.

100
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,087
(gasps) Should I get started on dinner?

101
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,694
That'd be great.

102
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:49,903
♪ Got you feeling nothing ♪
- I'll go grab our things.

103
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:54,761

104
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:58,039

106
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,712
- Oh, geez.
- Whoa.

107
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,591
Hey, I'm sorry.
- What the fuck, man?

108
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,486
I just wanted to,

109
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,916
I do apologize.
- Who are you?

110
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,016
- I'm Ben.
- Ben?

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,936
I'm the caretaker, the groundskeeper,

112
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,016
whatever you wanna call me.

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,316
I just live up the way,
I saw you guys drive in,

114
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,886
so I wanted to come introduce myself

115
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,546
and let you know that I'm
here should you need anything.

116
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,076
All right, um, yeah,
so, sorry, man, you, uh,

117
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,770
caught me off guard there.
- Yeah,

118
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:29,196
sorry about that. (laughs)
- But I appreciate

119
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,466
you letting us know you're here.

120
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,226
- Okay.
- But, uh, we're good, man.

121
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,176
Um, we have everything
we need, love this place.

122
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,466
Well, I'm so glad to hear that.

123
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,716
And again, I'm really sorry
I didn't mean to scare you.

124
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,053
No, it's, it's fine, man, really.

125
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:41,730
You know what?

126
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,366
It looks like you guys are
running low on firewood.

127
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,596
How about I chop you some?

128
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,336
- Oh, no, no, no, man.
- Come on, no, no, no, no, no.

129
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,806
Come on, I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

130
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,676
Let me do this for you,
it'll make me feel better.

131
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,026
Listen, I won't even bother you,

132
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,900
I'll just leave it by the front door.

133
00:06:58,496 --> 00:06:59,329
Uh.

134
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,136
Sure.

135
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,156
Appreciate that.

136
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,996
- Really, it's nothing at all.
(gentle suspenseful music)

137
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,146
Y'all enjoy your stay now.
(suspenseful music)

138
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,203
- Thanks, again.
(door squeaking)

139
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:23,826
Were you talking to someone?

140
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,806
Yeah, it's just a really
creepy old groundskeeper guy.

141
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,336
- Oh.
- Scared the shit out of me.

142
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,756
(chuckles) What did he want?

143
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,386
(sighs) Nothing really,

144
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,860
he was just welcoming us
and introducing himself.

145
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,576
- Weird.
- Hm.

146
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,216
Uh, anyways, what all do
you need for dinner tonight?

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,896
Okay, I need one of the
onions and then ground beef,

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,896
chorizo, tomatoes, pasta,

149
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,736
pasta sauce, and then
whatever veg you want tonight.

150
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,026
Oh, really?

151
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,466
Whatever veggie I want?
- Yes.

152
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,310
You get to-Ah, I get to choose?

153
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,356
Yes, (laughs) yes.

154
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,823
Hey, thank you for this.

155
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,213
Thank you.

156
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:09,238
(birds chirping)

157
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:15,396
Okay, how about you go sit down, relax,

158
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,256
and pick out whatever terrifying movie

159
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,756
you're gonna make us watch tonight.

160
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,726
Hey, this is not solely my tradition.

161
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,126
Okay, I don't like it anymore than you do.

162
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,594
So then why do we do this to ourselves?

163
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,330
(sighs) It's just what do we do, honey.

164
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,393
(laughs) Ooh.

165
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,183
Here.

166
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,316
Here, move it, I'll get it.

167
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,386
I know how sensitive you are with onions.

168
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,364
Mm, thank you.

169
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,016
Of course.

170
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,906
Hey, should I make us a cocktail?

171
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,366
Yes, please, uh, I didn't
bring the bar in yet though.

172
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,476
I'll go get it.

173
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,450
- Perfect.
- Okay.

174
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:57,951
(car beeping) (birds chirping)

175
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,144
(zip zipping)

176
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:08,250
(footsteps rustling)

177
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:18,602
(birds chirping)

178
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,981
(wind whistling)

179
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,611

181
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,383
Okay, what are we drinking?

182
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,053
I'll make it.

183
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,646
How about a martini?

184
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,893
Ooh, whenever you want.

185
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:48,589
Mm-hmm.

186
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:52,266
Although, being up
in the woods like this

187
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,396
does put me in the mood
for a whiskey something.

188
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,936
[Rebecca] Ah, I'm down
for a whiskey something.

189
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,827
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,356
All right.

191
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,246
[Rebecca] Thanks for
chopping these, baby.

192
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,036
[John] Hey, thank you
for doing everything else.

193
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,923

Yeah, as long as you don't

198
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,256
(chuckles) Oh my gosh,
that was hardly my fault.

199
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,446
I had just as many as you had.

200
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,820
And I blame that bartender.

201
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,376
Some people are just
too good at their jobs

202
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,656
for public health.
- Yeah, yeah.

203
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,186
So if you don't have
at least six of mine,

204
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,361
I'm gonna be offended.

205

(Rebecca laughs)

206
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,906
Thought I was your favorite bartender.

Ah, you are.

208
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,091

All right, I'm gonna enjoy
this drink on the back deck,

224
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,026
- Okay.
- Enjoy the view,

225
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,706
you should join me.

226
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,626

the mayor has announced the reopening

of the North Trail to the public.

267
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,146
This renovation has requested
twice the time and budget

268
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,766
that the town had initially approved

269
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,089

(suspenseful music)
- The city board stated

275
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,006
in their press release that the decision

276
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,956
to increase the budget
has allowed to rebuild

277
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,326
the old fence and secure the whole area,

278
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,276
which is commonly used for walks and hikes

279
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,746
by family and tourists.

280
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,576
The opposition party had run a campaign

281
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,276
for the measure to be assessed
to prevent more accidents

282
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,196
similar to the one that
caused a major concern

283
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,996
in the public opinion last year.

284
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,396

286
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,296
which nearly cost her her life.

287
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,396
The mayor allegedly ordered the variation

288
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,546
to contrast the growing popularity
of the opposition leader

289
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,956
who is expected to run for mayor

290
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,756

291
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,032

- I'm Ben.

309
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,446
I met your husband out front.

310
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,486
I told him I'd bring you some firewood.

just knock at the front door?

I know, I know, I probably should've,

314
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,506
I just, I had this whole bundle
of wood that I was carrying.

315
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,156
[Rebecca] Okay, well,
you just really scared me.

316
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,990
Again, I'm sorry.

317
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:21,310
I'll just pile this wood
up and I'll be on my way.

318
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:26,556
It's okay, you just
caught me off guard is all.

319
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,416
[Ben] Well, that was not my intention.

320
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,486
I saw your car drive down the road,

321
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,886
so I assumed that you
guys would both be out

322
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,366
and that this would be a good
time to drop the wood off.

323
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,033
Yeah, no, that makes perfect sense.

324
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,614
Sorry for my reaction.

325
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:43,688
Are you okay there?

326
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,229
Oh, uh, yes, yeah.

327
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,023
I just, I cut myself cooking dinner.

328
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,296
Well, be careful there.

329
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,306
There's a lotta things out
here that wanna kill you.

330
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,163
What?

331
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,607
[Ben] No, I just mean that, you know,

332
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,433
you should get that cleaned up.

333
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,403
It's easy to get an infection.

334
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,730
You got a first aid kit in there with you?

335
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,623
I'm not sure.

336
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,556
Well, you know, I could
run home and grab some stuff

337
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,293
for you and come back if you like.

338
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:16,986
No, no, no need, um, I'm
sure we have stuff around here.

339
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,666
I just haven't had a chance to look yet.

340
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,306
Uh, there's no need for you
to come back, we're good.

341
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,866
Okay.

342
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,409
Well, that should do you then,

343
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,377
(Ben exhales sharply)
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,236
Should be plenty for the next few days.

run out or you need anything,

you know, don't hesitate to call or,

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,896
you know, just come on by my place,

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,056
[News Reporter] Back to your
favorite local radio station.

356
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,556
This is still Quote Robinson here

357
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,446
with my fellow community citizens.

358
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,923
It's Friday night.
(gentle suspenseful music)

359
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,516
As in the rest of the country,
we are officially in summer.

360
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,886
As a matter of fact, it's
been a hot summer already,

361
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,996
and it looks like we're going to have

362
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,706
a very long summer this year.

363
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,646
Let's keep updating you on the
unusual tropical situation,

364
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,836
which is predicted to reach
the peak next weekend.

365
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,726
Tomorrow, Sunday, and Monday,

366
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,896
we're going to track the skies

367
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,756
given the monsoon moisture from the south.

368
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,256
Some areas may-
(suspenseful music)

369
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,836
Of 71 and a maximum of 79

370
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,836
with sky conditions that
were almost clear and silent.

371
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,786
We're warning you though,
the temperature will drop

372
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,846
to a minimum of 65 and a maximum of 72

373
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,156
on Tuesday and Wednesday,
where the chances of rain

374
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,156
will have a peak with
an average 65% of rain.

375
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,153
We will then bounce back to-
(suspenseful music)

376
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,727
(suspenseful music continues)

377
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:28,741
(suspenseful music continues)

378
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:34,136
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

379
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,827
(phone tapping)

380
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:42,129
(dial tone ringing)

381
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,610
(suspenseful music continues)

382
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:53,301
(phone ringing)

383
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,076
(phone beeping) (door clicks)

384
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,137
Who is it?

385
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,766
(door squeaks)

386
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,026
Who is it?

387
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,783
It's me, who do you think it is?

388
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,666
Sorry, I just, I got
freaked out a minute ago.

389
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,526
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

390
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,506
Wait, why do you have a knife?

391
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,950
'Cause that creepy
groundskeeper came by.

392
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,656
(sighs) Dammit, he came
off to drop off the wood,

393
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,793
didn't he?
- Yeah.

394
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,526
And you didn't think to
mention to your fiance,

395
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,466
who was here all alone, that
he might be stopping by, so.

396
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,596
I'm sorry, I forgot.

397
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,736
All right?
- Yeah, and-

398
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,110
- I'm sorry you got scared.

399
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,703
Did you know this
place doesn't have a TV?

400
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,556
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,386
I realized that when I got here,

402
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,423
but, uh, you have your laptop, right?

403
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

404
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:51,636
(sighs) I'm sorry, I
just got really scared.

405
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,586
I mean, he like came by the kitchen window

406
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,436
when I was at the sink and
just like came out of nowhere.

407
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,313
Came by the kitchen
sink., why didn't he,

408
00:20:58,337 --> 00:20:59,471
why didn't he go to the front door?

409
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:01,236
He, he thought that we had left together

410
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,103
when you went to go get pasta
so he didn't know I was here.

411
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,808
Hey, hey, what's this?

412
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:11,076
Oh, nothing, I just cut myself

413
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,756
when I was cook-
Nothing, let me see.

414
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
It's not that bad.

415
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,516
- Baby!
- It's not that bad.

416
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,676
Not that bad? You almost
cut your finger off.

417
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,577
You're ridiculous.

418
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,716
Did you clean it?

419
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,732
I just ran water over it.

420
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:25,705
(John sighs)

421
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:27,696
(speaks faintly) All right,
look, I'm gonna get some stuff

422
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,873
and I'm gonna clean it
up for you, all right?

423
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,257
Or at least pour some whiskey over it.

424
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,031
(Rebecca laughs)

425
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,036
You could take the boy out of the south.

426
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,423
- Hey, I heard that.
(Rebecca laughs)

427
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:48,106
(Rebecca exhales sharply)
(suspenseful music)

428
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,797
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

429
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:02,831
(suspenseful music continues)
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

430
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:07,359
(sighs) Okay.

431
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,919
All right. (cupboard doors thud)

432
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,429
(Rebecca groans)

433
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:15,396
Oh, come on, it's not
gonna hurt, all right?

434
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,792
Plus, we know what the
whiskey's really for, right?

435
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:21,157
(chuckles) Okay, fine,
let's just get it over with.

436
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,116
Okay, one second.

437
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,876
Wait, should we trust that?

438
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,953
Is it expired?

439
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,363
Do I even care?
- It's fine. It's fine.

440
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,146
All right, just a little bit

441
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,813
to make sure you don't get an infection.

442
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:38,123
You ready?
- Yeah.

443
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,436
(Rebecca groans)
- Oh, you're okay.

444
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,818
Uh-uh.

445
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:46,597
- All good.
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

446
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:47,454
All right.

447
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,910
Now just a quick bandaid, you'll be good.

448
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,018
Okay.

449
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,283
All right, good as new.

450
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,436
Although, I don't know if you
should be drinking alcohol,

451
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,206
you know, it's a blood thinner,

452
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,706
I should probably finish this for you.

453
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,046
Well, in that case,
(John chuckles)

454
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,903
Doctor Taylor

455
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,186
can go fuck himself.

456
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,746
- Wow, whoa.
- Mm.

457
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,763
Little harsh.

458
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,651
You know this house is expecting sex

459
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:18,666
- Mm.
- And we wouldn't wanna

460
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,440
disappoint the house now, would we?

461
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,594
Patience, Doctor.

462
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,843
Okay.

463
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,833
(water burbling)

464
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:35,425
(pasta rustling)

465
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,295
Okay, so, - Yeah.

466
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,776
We have about nine minutes
before the pasta's ready.

467
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,455
Um, so in the meantime we could...

468
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:49,446
So, what could we do in nine minutes?

469
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,422
Is that what you're asking?
(Rebecca laughs)

470
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,043
Huh?
- You're such a perv.

471
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,996
Oh, come on, you should appreciate

472
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,041
my completely appropriate
level of perviness.

473
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,376
- Hey.
- That's where we're at.

474
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,546
Mm.

475
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,733
For you, yes.

476
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,595
- Huh, you like it.
- Hmm.

477
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,316
Shut up, John.

478
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,073
Or you could shut me up.

479
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,670
Let's see if you can make it nine minutes.

480
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:23,614
(gentle suspenseful music)

481
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:29,806
(suspenseful music)

482
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:41,494
(suspenseful music continues)

483
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:44,736
(Rebecca exhales sharply)
(John breathes heavily)

484
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,436
So, (clears throat)

485
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,566
still got about six minutes
before the pasta's done.

486
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,763
- No way.
- Yeah.

487
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:54,063
(Rebecca laughs)
- Oh my gosh, shit.

488
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,658
Shut up. (Rebecca laughs)

489
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:00,355
(car alarm blaring)

490
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:01,879
Is that the car?

491
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:09,657
(car alarm continues blaring)

492
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:12,764
(suspenseful music)

493
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:16,570
(car beeps)

494
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:18,926
Stay here.

495
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:21,399
I'm sure it's nothing.

496
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,830
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

497
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:36,712
(suspenseful music continues)

498
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:42,254
(dramatic suspenseful music)

499
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,540
The car's fine.

500
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,316
I'm sure it was just a squirrel.

501
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,157
Nothing to worry about.

502
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,536
Okay, I'm gonna go drain the pasta

503
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,186
so it doesn't get sticky.

504
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,043
Come on.

505
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,527
(suspenseful music)
(door squeaks)

506
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:02,627
(branches rustling)

507
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:05,734
(footsteps rustling)

508
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:15,266
(dramatic suspenseful music)

509
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,974
(suspenseful music)

510
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:36,763
(suspenseful music continues)

511
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:45,814
(metal clanking)
(water spattering)

512
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:54,775
(suspenseful music continues)

513
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:05,781
(suspenseful music continues)

514
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,167
(water spattering)

515
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:18,789
(dramatic suspenseful music)

516
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:22,180
(suspenseful music)

517
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:23,037
John,

518
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:24,919
dinner's ready.

519
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:29,443
(water spattering)
- I'll be right up.

520
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:33,614
(John speaking faintly)

521
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:37,138
[Rebecca] What are you doing down there?

522
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,296
Baby?

523
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,466
Yeah?

524
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,786
[Rebecca] What's up?

525
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,006
Nothing, there's a pipe leaking.

526
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,716
I'll notify the owner in the morning.

527
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,666
Okay, well, come up and eat

528
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,826
because the pasta's getting cold.

529
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,446
Gotta watch a movie.

530
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,203
- Yeah, I'll be right up.
- Okay.

531
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:01,387
(dramatic suspenseful music)

532
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,693
So what kinda wine did you get?

533
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,095
(sighs) Pinot Noir, of course.

534
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,886
(Rebecca sighs)
Come on, it's your favorite.

535
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,592
- Yes.
- All right, you ready?

536
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:17,016
Um, am I gonna hate it?

537
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,786
Probably, yeah.

538
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,860
- Okay.
- All right.

539
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,901
(gentle suspenseful music)

540
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,476
- I already hate it.
- Oh, come on.

541
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,976
Give it a chance.

542
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,413
I will, I will, I'm sorry.

543
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,826
Next time I pick a movie.

544
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,756
[John] Hey, these old school
horror movies are classic.

545
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,796
Do you remember one
time when we were small,

546
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,476
we were out here?

547
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,306
It was from right over there.

548
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,256
I jumped out at you from behind the tree

549
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,666
and grandpa got all excited

550
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,053
and he shook his fist at me and he said,

551
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:02,136
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell." (laughs)

552
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,760
Remember that? Right over there.

553
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,890
Well, you used to really be scared here.

554
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,396
Johnny.

555
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,286
Oh, you're still afraid.

556
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,693
Stop it now, I mean it.

557
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:19,986
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

558
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,326
[Barbara] Stop it! You're ignorant.

559
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,266
[Johnny] They're
coming for you, Barbara.

560
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,306
[Barbara] Stop it,
you're acting like a child.

561
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,465
- What an asshole.
- They're coming for you.

562
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:31,116
(Rebecca gasps)
Look, there comes

563
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,343
one of them now.

564
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,616
- He'll hear you!
- I hope this movie

565
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,976
gets better.
- It will.

566
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,086
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!

567
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,005
- I'm relatively sure it does.
(Rebecca chuckles)

568
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,696
(gentle suspenseful music)

569
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,652
- Help!
- Boom!

570
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:48,732
- Jesus.
- Johnny,

571
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,577
help me! (Rebecca chuckles)

572
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:53,684
(suspenseful music)

573
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:03,534
(wall thudding)
(Johnny grunting)

574
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,246
(suspenseful music)

575
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,103
John,

576
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,143
what's that noise?

577
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,736
It must be the pipe.

578
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,416
Fuck, that's ridiculous.

579
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,036
Well, look, the pipes
are right below us,

580
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,686
right, you're gonna hear it.

581
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,066
Are you sure?

582
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,923
Yes.

583
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,903
Calm down.

584
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,912
Calm down, you calm down. Fuck.

585
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:33,115
(suspenseful music)

586
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,639
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

587
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:48,715
(suspenseful music)
(footsteps plodding)

588
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,831
(suspenseful music)

589
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,150
Remind me why we do this to ourselves.

590
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:03,666
[John] Hey, I think you're
still just a little creeped out

591
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,390
from the grounds keeper guy today.

592
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:09,624
[Rebecca] Yeah, probably.

593
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,609
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

594
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:17,214
Finally a reasonable
choice from this chick.

595
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,746
[John] Yeah, see,
she ain't that useless.

596
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,870
[Rebecca] We'll see.

597
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,514
(Barbara screams)

598
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:31,467
[John] Yeah, but if this was 1968,

599
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:34,640
you'd be cuddles up to me,
clenching my arm right now.

600
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:38,509
- (laughs) Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

601
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:43,533
[Rebecca] And then you would
have your hand on my knee.

602
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,062
[John] Oh, yeah?

603
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:47,389
[Rebecca] Slowly work it up like that.

604
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,151
[John] And then what?

605
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:52,229
[Rebecca] And then
you'd give me a foot rub.

606
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,535
- (laughs) What?
(Rebecca laughs)

607
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,016
A foot rub, is that what I would do?

608
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,217
Yeah, what were you thinking?

609
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,849
I was thinking about something else.

610
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:05,306
John! (laughs)

611
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,416
Okay, here we go.

612
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,186
I knew it was coming, but now it's on.

613
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,928
Oh, it's been on for a minute.

614
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:17,830
(Rebecca laughs)

615
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,936
(suspenseful music)

616
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:32,770
(suspenseful music continues)

617
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,846
(John sighs)

618
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,530
It's nice to get out of LA, huh?

619
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,623
So nice.

620
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,943
It's crazy how you can
see the stars out here.

621
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,463
- Yeah.
- Mm.

622
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,503
The town is so cute too.

623
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,173
Mm-hmm.

624
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,026
But it's so crazy how like the stores

625
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,580
are only open like a couple days a week

626
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,337
at really weird times.

627
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,433
Yeah, it's a family town.

628
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,846
Get a lot of people come
up here and raise families.

629
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,556
Raise kids.

630
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,413
Huh?

631
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,713
Yeah.

632
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,926
Hey, remember we gotta get
the stuff out of the car.

633
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,306
Uh,

634
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,493
yeah, we should do that.

635
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:28,350
Okay.

636
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,783
- Want some first?
- Mm.

637
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:40,230
- (sighs) Okay.
- Okay.

638
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:43,300
(floorboards creaking)

639
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:46,407
(footsteps plodding)

640
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:55,130
(door squeaks)

641
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,016
(zip zipping)

642
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,216
I'm gonna brush my teeth really quick.

643
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,280
Okay, I'm gonna change first.

644
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,032
Okay. (Rebecca groans)

645
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:16,710
(Rebecca yawns)

646
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:17,567
Ah.

647
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:25,921
(John yawns)

648
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:27,063
(John groans)

649
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:29,837
(water sloshing)

650
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,649
(gentle suspenseful music)

651
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:41,173
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

652
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:42,854
No.

653
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:48,600
(exhales sharply) One,

654
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:49,457
two.

655
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:56,042
(Rebecca groans)

656
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:56,899
Ah.

657
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,299
(water sloshing)

658
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:01,156
Mm, mm-mm.

659
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,202
Move over.

660
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:14,249
- So?
- (laughs) Maybe.

661
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,593
- Ah, I'll take a maybe.
(Rebecca laughs)

662
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:18,333
Okay, I know you will.

663
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,537
Hey, what time is it?

664
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,561
- It's like 11:30.
- Mm.

665
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:25,614
(urine spattering)

666
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:28,740
You better put that lid down
before you flush that toilet.

667
00:35:28,764 --> 00:35:32,223
(laughs) Don't I always?

668
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,901
You know how many germs fly
up when you flush a toilet?

669
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,776
(chuckles) Like a million.

670
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,469
I mean, yeah, it's gross.

671
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:40,656
Like, what do you wanna do,

672
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,260
brush your teeth with a poop toothbrush?

673
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,106
(John laughs) I don't think so.

674
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,236
Oh my gosh, is this like
some, uh, some fetish thing

675
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,070
we should talk about?
- Just-

676
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:50,556
- Okay, okay, look, I'll flush
the toilet now and forever.

677
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,413
Thank you.

678
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,483
Do you wanna go on
a hike in the morning?

679
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,548
Do I look like I wanna go
on a hike in the morning?

680
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:00,906
(laughs) Well, not yet.

681
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,456
Mm, and you guessed right.

682
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,867
You either get sex or a hike?

683
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:09,349
Pick one.
- Ah. (whistles)

684
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:10,676
Which one do you think I'm gonna choose?

685
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,450
(laughs) I know which one.

686
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:18,681
(toothbrush buzzing)

687
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:25,176
(water sloshing)

688
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:33,258
(ring clinks)

689
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:38,282
(dramatic suspenseful music)
(clock ticking)

690
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:50,460
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

691
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,735
(suspenseful music)

692
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:07,841
(suspenseful music continues)

693
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:19,753
(suspenseful music continues)

694
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,795
(suspenseful music continues)

695
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:43,766
(suspenseful music continues)

696
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:55,798
(suspenseful music continues)

697
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:59,409
(clock ticking)

698
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,623
(clock ticking continues)

699
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:13,903
(birds chirping)

700
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:19,302
(exhales sharply) Okay.

701
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:27,454
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

702
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:30,131
Mm.

703
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:41,631
(birds chirping)

704
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
[John] Mm.

705
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,592
- Good morning.
- Mm.

706
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,874
Wake up, Johnny Boy.

707
00:38:57,078 --> 00:38:57,911
Wake up.

708
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,586
- Mm.
- Want me to make

709
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,843
you some coffee?

710
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,483
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

711
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,693
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay.

712
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:18,717
Mm.

713
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:22,753
(John yawns)

714
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,493
Oh, or you can come back in bed.

715
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:36,052
(birds chirping)

716
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,996
(coffee rustles)

717
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:51,851
(gentle suspenseful music)

718
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,064
(John yawns)

719
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:56,133
(John exhales sharply)

720
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:57,601
(birds chirping)

721
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,066
(John sniffs)

722
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,383
(sighs) Smells great.

723
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,380
I'll join you in a minute.

724
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,816
(coffee burbling)

725
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,590
(glass clinking)

726
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:25,609
(door clicks) (door squeaks)

727
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,823
John, did you leave this
door unlocked last night?

728
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,503
Ah, shit, um, yeah, I might've.

729
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:40,416
(sighs) Are you fucking kidding me?

730
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,306
After that creepy guy
scared the shit out of us,

731
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,226
you're gonna leave this door unlocked?

732
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,163
Like, I just came out to have a smoke.

733
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,679
Okay, we're fine, it's
not that big a deal.

734
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:49,536
I get it.

735
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,910
(door clicks) (door squeaks)

736
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,234
Ugh, unbelievable.

737
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,473
Why, thank you.

738
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,813
Oh, wasn't a compliment.

739
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,075
(John sighs)

740
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,932
(coffee sloshing)

741
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,203
Um.

742
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,400
Thank you.
- Yep.

743
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:32,364
(mug clanks)
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

744
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:41,937
How about I make us some breakfast?

745
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:43,604
You hungry?

746
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:44,523
Yes, please.

747
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,966
[John] Do you want one egg or two?

748
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:49,823
Uh, two.

749
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:58,342
(fridge door thuds)

750
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,601
Aw. (chuckles)

751
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,708
Wow, so cute.

752
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:05,617
What?

753
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:08,973
Come look at this.

754
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,297
(Rebecca chuckles)

755
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,094
They're available for fostering.

756
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,923
(John exhales sharply)
Just saying.

757
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:26,076
Well, I'm just saying
that'll be really nice

758
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,066
for whoever fosters them, anybody but us.

759
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,940
But, hey, since we're on the subject,

760
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,013
I could do a baby instead.

761
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,126
We haven't even started
planning our wedding yet.

762
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,393
Right, have you set a date for that?

763
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:50,406
(scoffs) Okay, we're not
about to have this conversation

764
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,373
right now on our vacation, so.

765
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,363
(sighs) Right.

766
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,873
I'll just go back to making breakfast.

767
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:10,771
(bacon packet rustling)

768
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:15,745
(bacon sizzling)

769
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:23,016
Mm, delicious, baby, thank you.

770
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,890
You're welcome.

771
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,756
Hey, so I know you said
you didn't want to earlier,

772
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,936
but it's nice outside, - Mm.

773
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,256
I would love to go for a hike

774
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,980
or a walk around the neighborhood.

775
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,113
And?

776
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,293
And you're invited
if you'd like to join.

777
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,083
Um.

778
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,296
I don't know, I, uh-

779
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,237
- Don't worry about it.

780
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,736
I'm probably just gonna
go after breakfast.

781
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,776
No, yeah, I just, I
love that for you, baby,

782
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,293
I just don't really feel like it, so.

783
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,846
No pressure.

784
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,966
But I think I'm gonna
go and take my mat out,

785
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,240
do some yoga on the deck.

786
00:44:04,034 --> 00:44:05,684
(exhales sharply) That's great.

787
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,844
I won't try to convince you.

788
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:10,701
[Rebecca] Thank you.

789
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,666
Couldn't even make it through breakfast.

790
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,190
No, I just have to send
a quick email, I forgot.

791
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,213
I'm just messing with you.

792
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,096
What? Are you mad?

793
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,443
No, no.

794
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,600
I better go get ready though.

795
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:33,818
Okay.

796
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,799
(dishes clattering)

797
00:44:45,381 --> 00:44:50,381
(birds chirping)
(footsteps plodding)

798
00:44:58,134 --> 00:45:00,884
(birds chirping)

799
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,006
Okay.

800
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,863
All done.

801
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,118
Should be good for the rest of the day.

802
00:45:07,142 --> 00:45:08,392
That's great.

803
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,706
(Rebecca sighs)

804
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,380
You gonna be like this all day?

805
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,636
I'm not being like anything.

806
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,536
I just wanna get outside, go for a hike,

807
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,710
get out in some nature.

808
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,516
Why did you move my toothbrush?

809
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,373
I didn't.

810
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,746
John, it's okay, if you
knocked it over or something,

811
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,603
just tell me.

812
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,916
Rebecca, I didn't touch your toothbrush.

813
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,676
I only do when it's to
put it on the charger.

814
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,946
John, I know what I did
with my toothbrush last night.

815
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,896
I finished brushing my teeth
and I put it right there

816
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,059
next to the soap.

817
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,136
(water sloshing)

818
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,993
Well,

819
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,470
um, yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

820
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,933
Well, I know I didn't move it so,

821
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,003
had to have been you, but whatever.

822
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:09,409
Bullshit.

823
00:46:13,157 --> 00:46:15,907
(birds chirping)

824
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:25,986
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

825
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:36,017
(suspenseful music)

826
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:36,874
What?

827
00:46:43,264 --> 00:46:44,431
What the fuck?

828
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:48,839
John?

829
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:59,633
(suspenseful music continues)

830
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:11,977
(suspenseful music continues)
(insects chirping)

831
00:47:19,823 --> 00:47:23,740
(suspenseful music continues)

832
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:34,769
(suspenseful music continues)

833
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:45,803
(suspenseful music continues)

834
00:47:48,227 --> 00:47:52,060
(dramatic suspenseful music)

835
00:47:59,371 --> 00:48:00,383
(knocking on door)
(Rebecca gasps)

836
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:01,574
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

837
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:02,431
Dammit!

838
00:48:05,751 --> 00:48:08,288
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

839
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:09,306
Who is it?

840
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,683
Oh, just a neighbor.

841
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,533
I said, who is it?

842
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,496
Oh, I just live down the street.

843
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,236
How did you get into the gate?

844
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,766
Oh, I'm an old friend of the owner.

845
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,340
He gave me an extra remote
in case for emergencies.

846
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:31,027
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

847
00:48:31,051 --> 00:48:31,923
(sighs) Jesus.

848
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:35,616
- Hi.
- Hi, how can I help you?

849
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,326
I sincerely apologize
for disturbing you,

850
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,414
but my little Piglet got out last night.

851
00:48:40,438 --> 00:48:42,636
(gentle suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

852
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,736
Your cat's name is Piglet?

853
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,593
Yes, ma'am.

854
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,360
Okay, well, I haven't seen him.

855
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:53,253
That's strange, I, I swear
I saw him come this way.

856
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:57,036
And this is the only house that...

857
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,306
You know, it's okay, ma'am, if
you could just do me a favor?

858
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,746
If you happen to see him running around,

859
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:02,916
do you mind just calling that number

860
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,656
on the back of the picture?

861
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,306
Uh, we just live a ways down the road

862
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,530
and, well, there aren't
that many neighbors.

863
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,496
Are you sure he is not in here?

864
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,330
I know what I saw.

865
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:13,896
And if you could just let me come in

866
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,216
and take a quick look.
- No, it's okay,

867
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,646
I have your number, right,
so I'll just give you a call.

868
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,356
I'd rather you not come in the house, so.

869
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,856
Are you hiding my Piglet?

870
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,113
- What?
- Are you hiding my baby?

871
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:23,376
- No!
- I know he's in here.

872
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,756
Okay, I know what I saw.

873
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,717
Please just let me come in,

874
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:27,815
just for a second, please.
- Okay, you're crazy.

875
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,293
(knocking on door)

876
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,047
- Let me in!
- What the?

877
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:33,539
Let me in. (suspenseful music)

878
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:34,396
Geez.

879
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:45,753
(suspenseful music continues)

880
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:56,856
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

881
00:50:06,218 --> 00:50:08,392
(Rebecca grunts)

882
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:11,099
(Rebecca sighs)

883
00:50:11,123 --> 00:50:14,745
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

884
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:15,602
Fuck it.

885
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:25,624
(birds chirping)

886
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:37,003
(birds continue chirping)

887
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:47,157
(birds continue chirping)

888
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,983
(gentle suspenseful music)

889
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,754
Still got it.

890
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:54,051
(cork pops) Whoo!

891
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:56,535
(suspenseful music)

892
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,476
(insects chirping)

893
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:03,508
(lotion can hissing)

894
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:14,766
(suspenseful music continues)

895
00:51:18,832 --> 00:51:22,332
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

896
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:30,522
(suspenseful music continues)
(wind whooshing)

897
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:39,484
(dramatic suspenseful music)

898
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:42,591
(suspenseful music)

899
00:51:49,908 --> 00:51:53,825
(suspenseful music continues)

900
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:05,730
(suspenseful music continues)

901
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:16,814
(suspenseful music continues)

902
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:26,144
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

903
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:29,211
(laughs) Hi, baby.
- Hi.

904
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:30,187
Did you get a little sleepy out here?

905
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:31,313
Mm-hmm, yeah.

906
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:33,023
And I feel like I was dreaming about you

907
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:35,183
'cause now here you are.

908
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:37,236
(Rebecca laughs)
- (chuckles) Here I am.

909
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,137
Got back as soon as I could.

910
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:40,536
Aw, thanks, baby.

911
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,370
- Yeah.
- I love you.

912
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:42,483
I love you too.

913
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:45,846
I'm gonna go shower real
quick, I'm all sweaty.

914
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,376
Yeah, I know, I got sweaty too.

915
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,696
Shower sounds nice.

916
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,166
But I like it when you're sweaty.

917
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,016
Aw, gross. (laughs)

918
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,336
Why don't you go start the shower

919
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,433
and I'll be up to give you a surprise?

920
00:52:57,959 --> 00:52:59,209
- Okay.
- Okay.

921
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:04,416
(Rebecca chuckles)

922
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,023
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

923
00:53:10,976 --> 00:53:12,160
Mm.

924
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:17,184
Ooh, why, hello there.
(insects chirping)

925
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:20,908
(birds chirping)

926
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,574
(sighs) Mm.

927
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:27,644
Mm.

928
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:33,872
(water pattering)

929
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:43,257
(door clicks)

930
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:49,120
(door thuds)

931
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:58,244
(water continues pattering)

932
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,935
(gentle suspenseful music)

933
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:08,150

934
00:54:15,928 --> 00:54:19,845
(suspenseful music continues)

935
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:24,106
I miss you.

936
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:26,553
[John] I'm right here.

937
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,643

938
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:33,371

00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,395

You still got it.

955
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,263
Hmm, you still got it too, Mr. Taylor.

956
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,813
Now get out.

957
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,843
I have to pee. (laughs)
- Oh, all right.

958
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:25,799
(gentle suspenseful music)

959
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:30,329
So,

960
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,162
- So?
- What do you wanna do

961
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:32,110
the rest of the day?

962
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,120
Um, like beyond sitting on
the couch and drinking all day?

963
00:56:38,748 --> 00:56:41,316
(laughs) Yes, beyond that.

964
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,790
Mm, I don't know, what
were you thinking about?

965
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,006
I don't know, I mean,
we can go into town.

966
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,616
We can go to the lake.
- Mm-hmm.

967
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,723
Both sound fun.

968
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,793
Um,

969
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,466
honestly, nothing sounds better

970
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,388
than just lounging in
our underwear all day.

971
00:56:59,412 --> 00:57:00,786
(both laugh)

972
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,166
All right, can't argue with that one.

973
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,223
- Okay.
(gentle suspenseful music)

974
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,376
(suspenseful music)

975
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,655
[John] Of course, she got her UGGs.

976
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,016
[Rebecca] Hey, hey, come on,

977
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,643
you know I can't go anywhere
without them. (laughs)

978
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,883
I've been wearing these
UGGs since you met me, boy.

979
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:25,072
- I know.
- Better know.

980
00:57:25,096 --> 00:57:28,763
(gentle suspenseful music)

981
00:57:32,106 --> 00:57:35,189
(suspenseful music)

982
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:46,733
(suspenseful music continues)

983
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,647
(suspenseful music continues)

984
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,416
(gasps) No way.

985
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,454
Yes, ma'am. (Rebecca sighs)

986
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:07,626
[Rebecca] The absolutely
perfect martini.

987
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,916
Hey, this martini is
a special $20 martini

988
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,713
with blue cheese stuffed olives.

989
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:16,686
Yeah.
- Wow, that's a pretty

990
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,396
high price tag to live up to, baby.

991
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,436
But I'm rooting for it.
- Hey, these olives

992
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,996
are stocked with the finest blue cheese

993
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,796
that money can buy.
- Ah.

994
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,316
- It's a masterpiece.
- (laughs) Cheers.

995
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,440
[John] Cheers, baby.

996
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:32,333
- Mm.
- (whistles) Huh?

997
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,456
Wow.

998
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,966
I mean, that's a fucking
pretty good martini.

999
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,136
- Yes, it is.
- I don't know

1000
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,656
if it's worth $20, (John laughs)

1001
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,226
but it's pretty fucking good.
- Okay.

1002
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,730
(Rebecca laughs) I'll take that.

1003
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:48,587
Mm.

1004
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:53,856
Everything just tastes
better up here, huh?

1005
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,713
- Yeah.
- Hm.

1006
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,873
Hey.

1007
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,880
I mean, we could just move here.

1008
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,486
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1009
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,586
What, in like 10 years?

1010
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,803
Settle down, start a family.

1011
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,136
Yeah, that's an idea. (laughs)

1012
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,993
No,

1013
00:59:13,156 --> 00:59:14,073
I'm being serious.

1014
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,143
Baby,

1015
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,096
you know

1016
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,746
I can't leave LA 'cause of work,

1017
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,443
I mean, plus our whole lives are there.

1018
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,530
What would we do, just abandon everything?

1019
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,010
I'm just saying,

1020
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,543
think about it?
(suspenseful music)

1021
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,790
Let's play a game.

1022
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,766
(Rebecca chuckles)

1023
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,803
- A game?
- Yeah.

1024
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:47,752
(suspenseful music)

1025
00:59:47,776 --> 00:59:49,779
Um.
- What game do you wanna play?

1026
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:51,605
[Rebecca] Let's play poker.

1027
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,033
- You wanna play poker?
- I'm good at poker.

1028
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,586
[John] Okay, do you have
the cards? Poker chips?

1029
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,786
I mean, like, it's not
gonna be that much fun

1030
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,788
without any poker chips.

1031
00:59:59,812 --> 01:00:00,621
(suspenseful music)
- No, I wouldn't

1032
01:00:00,645 --> 01:00:01,455
say that, John.

1033
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:03,199
(Rebecca screams)
- Hey, hey!

1034
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:04,033
(gun clicks) Whoa, hey, man,

1035
01:00:04,057 --> 01:00:05,046
who the fuck are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1036
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,693
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

1037
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,356
[John] What is this, man,
huh, what the fuck do you want?

1038
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,070
Is this how you treat a guest?

1039
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:13,802
Hey.

1040
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,503
- May I sit?
- Hey, man,

1041
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,056
hey, whatever this is, man,

1042
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,376
it ain't fucking funny, all right?

1043
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,933
It isn't funny at all, what would be?

1044
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,423
John.

1045
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,807
John.

1046
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:30,246
Hey, man.

1047
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,205
Hey, look, we'll give you
whatever you want, man,

1048
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:35,463
all right, please just, just
stop pointing the gun at her.

1049
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,066
Do you see that, Rebecca?

1050
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,756
This is John way try to take
some sort of control back

1051
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,133
in this situation.

1052
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,943
You have lost control, John.

1053
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:51,459
Okay, all right, hey,

1054
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:52,683
hey, what can I do, huh?

1055
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,696
Huh, what can I do?

1056
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,986
I'll tell you what you can do.

1057
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,296
How about you fill that shaker with ice

1058
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,466
and grab everything you need

1059
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,553
in order to make one of those
perfect martinis of yours?

1060
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,516
- Now?
- Yes, John, now.

1061
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,056
If it takes more than a
minute, I shoot your wife.

1062
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,426
Chop, chop. (suspenseful music)

1063
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,656
Don't do anything stupid,

1064
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,593
I can see her forehead
from here perfectly.

1065
01:01:17,443 --> 01:01:18,429
[John] Okay.

1066
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:20,357
It's okay, sweetheart.

1067
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:22,476
(ice rattling)

1068
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,523
Hurry up, John,

1069
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:26,253
the clock is ticking.

1070
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,293
Here we go, John.

1071
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,046
Thank you kindly.

1072
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:35,903
Have a seat.

1073
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:48,936
Whoa, this is a perfect martini, John.

1074
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,333
It's like a confection for bartender.

1075
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:55,653
Why you don't drink?

1076
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,853
Sweethearts, come on, have a sip.

1077
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:06,213
- You're a sick man.
(suspenseful music)

1078
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,401
Do I look like sick for you?

1079
01:02:15,425 --> 01:02:17,339
Do I look like sick for you?

1080
01:02:17,363 --> 01:02:20,033
I mean, John, do I look like sick for you?

1081
01:02:20,057 --> 01:02:22,872
'Cause I feel so healthy right now.

1082
01:02:22,896 --> 01:02:24,606
(Rebecca gasps)
- Fuck!

1083
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:29,463
Damn, eh, fuck, I just wanna
play our little game, man.

1084
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,379
I need you to put these on, guys.

1085
01:02:35,403 --> 01:02:37,116
(handcuffs clank)

1086
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,696
Come on, John, have a seat over there.

1087
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,506
I said now, John, - All right.

1088
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,416
- Have a seat over there.
- All right, all right,

1089
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,092
okay, okay, all right.

1090
01:02:46,116 --> 01:02:48,726
(Rebecca breathing heavily)
- Chop chop, sweetheart.

1091
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,650
Have a seat there.

1092
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,137
I want your left hand, her right hand.

1093
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,316
Hey, you never told us your name.

1094
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,356
My name is what? My name is who?

1095
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,621
- What's your name? Hey!
(Rebecca crying)

1096
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:04,455
Hey, are you okay?

1097
01:03:04,479 --> 01:03:08,376
Hey, okay, okay, all right, all right.

1098
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,056
- Put them on.
(handcuffs rattling)

1099
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,146
Could you squeeze them a little bit more?

1100
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:16,315
You know, there is something
so satisfy about that sound.

1101
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:20,226
(handcuffs creaking)
(Rebecca breathing shakily)

1102
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,696
Like this. (suspenseful music)

1103
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,096
(chair rattles)

1104
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,413
There you go, John.

1105
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:27,443
What now?

1106
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,020
That's the question, John.

1107
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:34,236
We could watch a movie, how about that?

1108
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,983
I'm not sure, did you guys ever finish

1109
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:37,956
"The Night of the Living Dead?"

1110
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,486
Or, or maybe you can lead
us through some yoga.

1111
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,810
That would be nice, Becky.

1112
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:51,539
[John] It's okay.

1113
01:03:51,563 --> 01:03:54,156
No, John, it isn't okay at all.

1114
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,377
But it will be, I promise you.

1115
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:03,150
(breathing heavily) Why,
why are you doing this, huh?

1116
01:04:06,688 --> 01:04:11,586
(exhales sharply) I've
been playing this game

1117
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,850
since I was

1118
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,873
16 years old.

1119
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,383
My father passed it on to me,

1120
01:04:21,522 --> 01:04:23,706
and I must play one per year,

1121
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:27,123
every year until I lose or I die.

1122
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:30,183
It is what it is.

1123
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,683
This is the way it has to be.

1124
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:34,743
But why us?

1125
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,716
Why do you have to do this to us?

1126
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,063
We don't deserve this.

1127
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:44,136
Why not you?

1128
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,799
Why not you?

1129
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,046
I mean, what makes you more
special than any other couples

1130
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,623
in any other cabin in this little town?

1131
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:55,893
Why you?

1132
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:02,373
Well, I'm afraid just the luck of my draw.

1133
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,010
I'm curious though,

1134
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:08,283
would you ever replace yourself
with an innocent couple?

1135
01:05:09,484 --> 01:05:11,826
(suspenseful music)

1136
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:12,683
Interesting.

1137
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:20,060
I'm always so intrigued at this
moment between any couples.

1138
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,520
Okay.

1139
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,896
Okay, what happens now, huh?

1140
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,589
Straight to the point, I
like that about you, John.

1141
01:05:29,613 --> 01:05:32,064
But, you know, maybe
sometimes Becky will love

1142
01:05:32,088 --> 01:05:33,169
a little bit more of foreplay.

1143
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:35,077
You son of a bitch.

1144
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:38,166
(laughs) All right,
John, all right, John,

1145
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,697
I think it's time to play our game, right?

1146
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:44,804
(suspenseful music)

1147
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,116
Now,

1148
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:52,933
I assume you both are
familiar with the game of War.

1149
01:05:55,530 --> 01:06:00,530
Good. (suspenseful music)

1150
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,433
This is my beauty,

1151
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,753
my extremely reliable beauty.

1152
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,030
I'm gonna place a bullet

1153
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,773
in one of the chamber.

1154
01:06:20,003 --> 01:06:23,086
(suspenseful music)

1155
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,943
We play by the rules of War,

1156
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,176
then the loser,

1157
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,963
they're gonna play their own
game of Russian roulette.

1158
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:38,660
We play until there only two of us left,

1159
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:44,616
and I'm gonna be

1160
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,063
in every bit as much as you are.

1161
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,043
Exciting, right?

1162
01:06:53,758 --> 01:06:55,520
Who goes first?

1163
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,896
Meeny, miny,

1164
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,753
moe,

1165
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:04,503
let's put our fate in Rebecca hands.

1166
01:07:05,915 --> 01:07:07,515
Would you like to draw it first?

1167
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:09,953
No.

1168
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,200
What you mean no?

1169
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,990
I'm not gonna take part
in your sick little game,

1170
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,153
if you wanna see someone dead,

1171
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:24,213
you can pick up that gun
and take your own life.

1172
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,313
This isn't on us.

1173
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:32,488
This is you being a psycho,
okay, we didn't do anything.

1174
01:07:32,512 --> 01:07:35,595
(suspenseful music)

1175
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:42,863
Becky,

1176
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,413
the rules are simple.

1177
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,213
If you refuse to play,
that's called forfeit.

1178
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,693
So

1179
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,563
Any card that we draw
will be higher than yours.

1180
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:05,453
So if you keep this route,
this game will be fairly quick.

1181
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:10,566
(John exhales sharply)

1182
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,273
The choice is yours, baby.

1183
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:16,828
God, John.

1184
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:19,685
- Goddammit.
- John, what do we do?

1185
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:24,983
Draw a card, Rebecca.

1186
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:29,327
- Bravo, John, bravo.
(suspenseful music)

1187
01:08:32,516 --> 01:08:34,516
[John] Draw the card.

1188
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:40,746
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

1189
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:47,916
- (exhales sharply) Oh, Jesus.
- I mean,

1190
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,240
there is plenty below her.

1191
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,360
Action on you, John, you now.

1192
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:57,022
(suspenseful music)

1193
01:09:01,532 --> 01:09:06,282
[Rebecca] (breathes heavily) Oh, God.

1194
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:08,493
Okay.

1195
01:09:08,517 --> 01:09:09,350
Oh, okay.

1196
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,513
So,

1197
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,056
lucky number seven.

1198
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,166
Yes!

1199
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,683
I'm not so lucky today, huh, John?

1200
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,010
Go ahead.

1201
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:30,970
- Ah! (screams)
(Rebecca shrieks)

1202
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:33,786
(John breathing heavily)

1203
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:35,493
Told you this was exciting.

1204
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:37,973
Ooh!

1205
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:41,458
Fuck.

1206
01:09:41,482 --> 01:09:44,976
(John and Rebecca breathing heavily)

1207
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,564
How many times have you done this?

1208
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:49,438
Are you sure you want to know that?

1209
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,266
17 people, they come and
go the touch of this gun

1210
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,576
since it came into my life.

1211
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,163
Yes, John, now you know.

1212
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:00,983
Jesus.

1213
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,273
Well, I'm not a believer,

1214
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,416
but if the Bible is true,

1215
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,153
I'm sure it's on your side.

1216
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:18,806
(John breathing heavily)

1217
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:26,039
(gun tapping)
(suspenseful music)

1218
01:10:28,885 --> 01:10:31,635
(Rebecca groans)

1219
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,823
You're not dead yet,
John, you're not dead yet.

1220
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:40,828
(suspenseful music continues)

1221
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,716
How they say, winner, winner,

1222
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,067
chicken dinner, right?
- Oh, fuck.

1223
01:10:48,091 --> 01:10:50,659
Goddammit. (Rebecca groans)

1224
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:51,861
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

1225
01:10:51,885 --> 01:10:56,052
It's okay, it's okay,
baby, it's okay, it's okay.

1226
01:10:57,376 --> 01:10:58,812
(gasps) Oh my gosh,

1227
01:10:58,836 --> 01:10:59,646
John. (crying)
- It's okay.

1228
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,641
Hey, I'll take this one.

1229
01:11:00,665 --> 01:11:02,396
- I'll take.
- Don't you fucking

1230
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,372
touch the gun or I'm gonna shoot her.

1231
01:11:05,396 --> 01:11:06,206
If you don't play - Okay.

1232
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,756
Okay, okay.
- By the rules, I both shoot.

1233
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,023
Okay, okay, I fucking get it.

1234
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:12,290
I get it, okay?
- Don't do it again, John.

1235
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:13,581
Don't do it again.

1236
01:11:13,605 --> 01:11:15,688
I'll play by the rules.

1237
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:18,276
Ah, fuck!

1238
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:21,991
(Rebecca groans)

1239
01:11:22,015 --> 01:11:23,153
Listen, (breathing heavily)

1240
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:26,484
it's okay, its okay.
(Rebecca crying)

1241
01:11:26,508 --> 01:11:29,913
Now, you bring up an
interesting carrier.

1242
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,433
Rebecca can take this gun,

1243
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,706
she can put it to her head.

1244
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:43,656
Or she can choose to turn the gun on you.

1245
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,616
- No, no, I could never.
(John breathes heavily)

1246
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,191
No.
- No, but you have to.

1247
01:11:51,215 --> 01:11:52,458
- What?
- Honey, you have to,

1248
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:55,028
look, I couldn't live
with myself without you.

1249
01:11:55,052 --> 01:11:56,322
(Rebecca and John breathing heavily)

1250
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:58,056
All right, all right, you
have to do this, all right?

1251
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,856
You have to do this for us.

1252
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,386
Okay?

1253
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,126
Okay?
- No, no, no, no, no.

1254
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:07,746
Please, please, sir, please,
I'm sorry for everything,

1255
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:11,223
but please just d-don't
make me do this, okay?

1256
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:13,773
(crying) We'll do anything, please.

1257
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,143
I will kill you.

1258
01:12:17,197 --> 01:12:20,046
And don't do anything stupid.

1259
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,123
It's your choice.

1260
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:23,946
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

1261
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,803
Hey, hey, baby,

1262
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,316
just grab the gun, okay,

1263
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,503
one step at a time, okay?

1264
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:33,920
Okay?

1265
01:12:40,364 --> 01:12:42,397
Come on, you got it.

1266
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:44,353
(dramatic suspenseful music)
Come on, there you go.

1267
01:12:44,377 --> 01:12:48,699
There you go, baby, there
you go, there you go.

1268
01:12:48,723 --> 01:12:52,021
(Rebecca crying)

1269
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:54,966
But, John, (breathing heavily)

1270
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:58,576
What if the bullet is in
the chamber when I shoot?

1271
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,226
(suspenseful music)

1272
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,626
Honey, I'm not kidding, it has to be me.

1273
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:05,460
- No.
- All right, it has,

1274
01:13:05,484 --> 01:13:06,756
you have to pull the trigger on me,

1275
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,590
honey.
- No.

1276
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:09,486
Look, I know this isn't fair
of me to ask for you, honey,

1277
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,106
but I need you to do this, okay?

1278
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:12,963
John,

1279
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,606
I can't hurt you.

1280
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,143
Oh, no, you're not hurting me.

1281
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,886
All right, you're giving me what I want,

1282
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,392
you're giving me a chance to see you live.

1283
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:25,167
(Rebecca breathes heavily)
All right, whatever happens,

1284
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:27,410
it's okay, it's okay.

1285
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:28,267
Okay?

1286
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:32,318
Okay, we've had a beautiful life together.

1287
01:13:32,342 --> 01:13:34,184
Huh? Right?
- Mm.

1288
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,230
(John breathes heavily)
- We have, we have.

1289
01:13:36,254 --> 01:13:38,254
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We have.

1290
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:41,923
(suspenseful music)

1291
01:13:41,947 --> 01:13:44,390
- It's okay, it's okay.
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

1292
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:47,708
All right, (breathes
heavily) you have do this.

1293
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:49,139
You have to do this.

1294
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,913
(crying) John.

1295
01:13:54,162 --> 01:13:55,245
Okay, okay.

1296
01:13:57,008 --> 01:13:59,379
Just grab the gun, baby.
- (breathes heavily) No.

1297
01:13:59,403 --> 01:14:00,808
- Grab the gun, baby.
- No.

1298
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,824
- Grab the gun, baby.
- No.

1299
01:14:03,848 --> 01:14:04,731
All right.

1300
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:07,301
(both breathing heavily)

1301
01:14:07,325 --> 01:14:09,435
- This is how it ends.
(suspenseful music)

1302
01:14:09,459 --> 01:14:13,007
(both breathing heavily)

1303
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,190
It was gonna end one
way or another, right?

1304
01:14:16,214 --> 01:14:18,066
(Rebecca crying)

1305
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:19,646
I love you, Rebecca.

1306
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:21,894
I love you so much.

1307
01:14:21,918 --> 01:14:23,026
So much.
- I love you, baby,

1308
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:23,967
I love you.

1309
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:26,832
I've always loved you.

1310
01:14:26,856 --> 01:14:30,462
- Pull the trigger.
(Rebecca crying)

1311
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:31,322
Pull the trigger.

1312
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:32,339
(Rebecca screams) (gun fires)

1313
01:14:32,363 --> 01:14:36,083

1314
01:14:36,107 --> 01:14:38,950
