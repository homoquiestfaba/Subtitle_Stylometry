1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,659
So, this is my senior
year of high school.

2
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:08,665
l've spent the last four years with a
bunch of horny football players and, uh

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,327
sex-obsessed teenagers.

4
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:14,132
So l figured l'd find
out what the big deal was.

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,069
l was 1 9.

6
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:24,580
l was 1 7.

7
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:25,808
Seventeen.

8
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:26,907
l think l was 1 6.

9
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,383
Fourteen.

10
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,155
Ah, we went for about 45
minutes the first go, yeah.

11
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:37,319
U m, not very long.

12
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,920
About threes minutes, actually.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,995
l was so damn scared l put my
condom on before l took off my pants.

14
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:51,940
lt wasn't that great, honestly.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,606
lt was kinda embarrassing and we
didn't know what parts went in where.

16
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:59,547
And unfortunately it was the
worst experience of my life.

17
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:03,713
lt lasted three seconds, there was no
magic, and his mother walked in on us.

18
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,282
We were on a bed and we
were making out and stuff.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,023
Then she went down, came
up, and then l looked up

20
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:16,624
and she turned around and there was
a room full of people watching us.

21
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,262
She grabbed her vodka, she screamed,
and she bolted out the door.

22
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,601
Last time l ever talked to her.

23
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,608
<i>( Katlyn ) So walt a second, dld
you actually make love to her?</i>

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,645
Yeah. Well, l made love to her face.

25
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,583
l think l made it into this big
thing and then l was disappointed

26
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:37,382
because it wasn't what l
thought it was going to be.

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,757
Well, my first time's gonna
be with Stanford, of course.

28
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:45,057
<i>lt's gonna be really romantlc.</i>

29
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,997
We'll light candles and
we'll play some French music

30
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,831
and he'll pick me up
and carry me to the bed

31
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,995
and we'll just like,
fall into each other

32
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,006
<i>and have the most amazlng connectlon.</i>

33
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,339
Like, be in total sync with one another.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,005
Ow! Franklin? Will you watch it?

35
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,514
Yeah, sorry.

36
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,072
Helen, you okay?

37
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,777
l'm fine.

38
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:10,412
All right.

39
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:14,015
<i>Look, he wants you. Screw the speculatlve
romance crap and just do lt already.</i>

40
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,458
<i>Chasel l just don't thlnk
you should rush lnto anythlng.</i>

41
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:19,519
l mean, it's your first time, it should
be special, you know. Like, plan it out.

42
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,427
l know,
but--

43
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:23,865
<i>What's there to plan?
Condoms, lube, room.</i>

44
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:26,801
<i>l meant be emotlonally prepared
so you don't regret anythlng.</i>

45
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,339
l am. l think.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,375
<i>Look, everyone's flrst tlme sucks.
That's why next party l go to</i>

47
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,435
l'm finding the hottest, drunkest guy
l can and just getting it over with.

48
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,276
<i>l'm gonna be ln New York next year.</i>

49
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,646
That is such a slut-bag thing to do.

50
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,548
Exactly.

51
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,644
Look, all l'm saying is
you should just do it.

52
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:46,053
Why?

53
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:47,454
<i>That's why.</i>

54
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,117
lt's good.

55
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:50,490
They're just friends.

56
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:54,122
Yeah, you know, l stretch with
my friends like that all the time.

57
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:56,393
Whatever.

58
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,958
<i>( coach ) Let's hlt those dummles, boysl</i>

59
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:01,300
l hear she likes it rough, Frankie boy.

60
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:04,136
( coach ) Skeets, let's leave
the doll playing for home.

61
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,334
O'mon.

62
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,242
Ah, you sexy beast.

63
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:09,836
Freak.

64
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:12,474
She's all yours, buddy.

65
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:31,599
Wait, wait.

66
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,931
Ah, right.

67
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,664
We should plan this better.

68
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,435
Okay, yes, let's, uh,
let's plan away then.

69
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,341
Well, Saturday my dad's
finally out of the house.

70
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:43,175
Saturday? Okay, yeah. Saturday's good.

71
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:44,771
Say 7: 30?

72
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,784
Yes. 7: 30, Saturday. Done.

73
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,614
Okay.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,381
Okay. l gotta go, all right?

75
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,514
Hey, l heard Hannah doesn't
shower after practice.

76
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:55,286
You mean cheerleader Hannah?

77
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:55,882
Yeah.

78
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,792
She's nice

79
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,696
but she probably wears the same
underwear for like a week straight.

80
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,700
l just thought you should know.

81
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:06,635
Well, l don't know, you guys were just
pretty close when stretching earlier.

82
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,298
Oh, babe, come on. We're just--
we're just friends. You know that.

83
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,806
Yeah, okay.

84
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,967
All right. l gotta go.

85
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:14,305
- Okay.
- All right.

86
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:14,810
Bye, babe.

87
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,880
Bye.

88
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:22,980
<i>Bye, Dad. l'm off to Chase's.</i>

89
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,217
Hey, could you come
in here for a second?

90
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,656
<i>l was gonna klss you goodbye.</i>

91
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:32,619
<i>Oh, my God. Dad?</i>

92
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,789
Look, as your parent

93
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,493
l feel it's my responsibility to at
least discuss this stuff with you.

94
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,332
Dad, l'm almost 1 8. l don't
need to hear this from you.

95
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:44,331
This is a female contraceptive.

96
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,502
lt goes, um, in.

97
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,011
My God.

98
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,274
lt's got no hormonal side effects.

99
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,512
U h, it's doctor recommended,
and you've got to use it six hours

100
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:58,282
<i>before the, uh, event occurs.</i>

101
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:02,759
l'm leaving. Bye! Thank you for
another painful childhood memory.

102
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:06,126
Hey, will you come here?
You think you're embarrassed?

103
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:10,691
l had to go down to the pharmacy
and actually buy this shit.

104
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,432
Anyway, this is the
vaginal contraceptive film.

105
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:18,873
l did not know this product
existed until about five hours ago.

106
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:23,209
<i>Dad, thls ls even more embarrasslng than
the tlme you brought me Maxl-Pads to school.</i>

107
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,146
Super Maxi-Pads!

108
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,207
l didn't know what size to get.

109
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,981
How was l supposed to know
there were different sizes?

110
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,386
Nobody talks about that stuff.

111
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,549
Anyway, this is the cap.

112
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,391
Also known as the, uh, diaphragm.

113
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:41,795
You take this gel and

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,466
it kills the guy's. . . spunk.

115
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:50,666
Dad, l don't think l could ever
have sex after hearing this from you.

116
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:54,006
Good. So you haven't?

117
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,137
Bye!

118
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,477
<i>Oh, hey, don't forget the
old standby, the condom.</i>

119
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:01,416
Make him wear two of
these. At least two!

120
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,018
Well, that went well.

121
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:16,090
Gentlemen, we have
earned a right of passage.

122
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:21,928
The Buccaneer Bang Book.

123
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:30,236
Between these covers, lay our virgins.

124
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,942
<i>And we know what to do wlth them, yes?</i>

125
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,510
<i>C'mon, Skeets. l mean, lsn't thls whole
thlng llke a blg superstltlon, really?</i>

126
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,021
Wha--? A-a
superstition?

127
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,614
What happens in these pages

128
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,956
symbolizes what happens
out on that football field.

129
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,120
lt unites us men for a single cause.

130
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,030
Need l remind you of
what happened in 1 9 7 9?

131
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,127
<i>They went down as the blggest
losers our school has ever seen.</i>

132
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:56,229
<i>Now, we can elther be a
bunch of cock block losers</i>

133
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:59,572
or we can have history
remember us as winners!

134
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,907
You pick.

135
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,207

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,214
<i>Wow, thank you, Marco.</i>

<i>To you Pete, we owe everythlng.</i>

140
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:17,821
Now, let's get to our virgins.

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,928

00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,834

<i>Hey, l'm glvlng you Katlyn

Good. At least one of you

00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:47,284
l told him to bring protection,
he actually wore a helmet.

341
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,121
Anyway, a minute and a half later,
he was my first. l got him in.

342
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:52,684
Sorry, in what?

343
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:56,699
The book. The boys won the championship
that year. Are we done? l gotta go.

344
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,964
U m, hey, what book
are you talking about?

345
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,062
You know what book. l mean, you
are the girls who are still in it.

346

No check marks next to your names,
letting down the entire team, yeah.

347
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:09,375
Hey, look, just because you're
sleeping with the entire team

348
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:11,471
gives you no right to judge
my friends and l , okay?

349
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,142
Yeah, well, maybe if you stopped hiding
behind that camera you'd actually get some.

My cheerleading season ends
when football season ends.

354
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,753

get into school next year.

and just lose it already.

<i>Yeah, l mean thlnk of the stuff that

And for what?

535
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:54,886
So we can be sitting around the phone
for hours just waiting for them to call?

536
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,558
<i>l mean, do we really
have to conslder thls?</i>

537
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,126
When a guy sleeps with a million
girls, he's some big man on campus.

538
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:05,231
And we do and we get called
sluts. We have to take a stand.

Are you guys sure we're
in the right place?

543

Tween Gaia worship. They're hooking
them while they're young now.

544
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,117
What's Gaia?

545
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:52,210
lt's like witchcraft or something.

546
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:54,688
lt's actually a good read.

547
00:28:54,757 --> 00:28:58,625
l was hoping someone from class would
come visit, but l'm glad it's you three.

548

<i>U h, some of us heard that
there's some klnd of a place?</i>

549

550
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:07,062
Back room?

551
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,400
Yeah, you know, like, back room.

Follow me.

555
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:23,081
lt's not exactly a back room.

556
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,052
lt's more of a secret garden.

557
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:28,056
A place for goddess worship.

558
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:29,591
Sit down, sisters.

559
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,820

Now, tell me. This is about
the boys and football, isn't it?

563
00:29:40,303 --> 00:29:41,827
Well, beware.

564
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:43,565
They will say anything

566
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:49,934
They will dress nice. Smell good.

<i>They mlght wrlte you a

They might even say '' l love you. ''

<i>But let me explaln one thlng to you.</i>

570

One thing that you need to understand

00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,021
The power of the pussy.

572

Excuse me?

573
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:14,528
The power of the pussy.

574
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,970
Okay, that's what l thought you said.

575
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,600
<i>l n prehlstory, women's power of

<i>Only through sex could men hope
to glimpse the hlgher power.</i>

577
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,474
The life force that
naturally flows through women.

578
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,882
<i>We are the mothers, the creators</i>

579

This is why you are here today.

<i>Now let us hold hands and chant.</i>

We give birth. We are women.

586

Oreation is ours.

587
00:30:58,714 --> 00:31:03,083
Our monthly blood flow
gives us the power.

588
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:07,088
The power of the pussy,
the pussy, the pussy.

589
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:13,754
The power of the pussy.

590
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,197
Ah ! Feel the power.

Yeah, just a little bit.

Well, what do you think of this bad boy?

597
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:04,978
What is that?

598
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:07,311
What's it look like? A toilet.

599
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,477
You wanted your own bathroom in
your room. Now you're gonna get it.

600
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,248
l wanted this years
ago. lt's too late now.

601
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:16,485
What are you talking about? l'll
have it in the closet by Friday.

602
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,495
Dad, why are you doing
this? lt isn't fair!

603
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,090
So, let me get this straight.
You don't want your own bathroom?

604
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,499
Yes, l did, when l was 1 2.

605
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,334
l'm almost 1 8 now and l'm moving out.

606
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:34,341
Also, did l mention you're
gonna get your own entrance?

607
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:37,844
l , uh, l'm gonna put in some
stairs and a door right here.

608
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,406
This way you can come
and go as you please.

609
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:45,011
Oh, and by the way, no curfew
as soon as you turn 1 8.

610
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:48,113
Dad, you're not doing this for
me, you're doing this for you.

611
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,957
l thought you were worried about me leaving,
but you're just afraid of being alone.

612
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:56,430
Okay, obviously you're not in the
mood to talk about this right now.

613
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:57,693
Get a dog !

614
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,598

Will you get this toilet out of my room?

You trying to get me drunk, huh?

1083

Something like that.

<i>(guy ) Does anybody

No, no. No, no.

1102
01:01:11,993 --> 01:01:13,824
The dosage we used was too high.

1103
01:01:13,894 --> 01:01:16,954
l may have accidentally
put in a few too many pills.

1104

1109
01:01:37,585 --> 01:01:39,917
Hey, you take care,
Stanny boy, all right?

1110
01:01:40,021 --> 01:01:42,353
[Stan groans]

1111
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:44,823
l warned him about you.
You're such a tease.

1112
01:01:51,899 --> 01:01:53,264
Look what you did.

1113
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,596
What do you mean what l did?

1114
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,931
That was an accident.

1115
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,265
You told me they were safe.

1116
01:01:57,371 --> 01:01:58,269
<i>l thought they were, okay?</i>

1117
01:01:58,372 --> 01:02:00,863
How am l supposed to know you're
not supposed to put that many pills?

1118
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:04,104
You know, if it weren't for you
two, l would have had sex by now

1119
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,702
and Stan and l would be happy. But no.

1120
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,714
Stop blaming us, okay?

1121
01:02:07,782 --> 01:02:10,546
lf you really wanted to have
sex that bad, you would've.

1122
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:14,520
lt's not dependent on what
we say. lt's your choice.

1123
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:28,364
Hey.

1124
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:32,466
How are you?

1125
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:37,634
Talk to me.

1126
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:41,204
You-you did this to me. What
else is there to talk about?

1127
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:45,309
What about you? There was
no truce. You didn't stop.

1128
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,719
<i>All you cared about was the bang
book and your llttle football team.</i>

1129
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:51,257
lt was just a stupid
superstition between us guys.

1130
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:54,817
You know, like putting your right shoe
on before your left. lt wasn't real.

1131
01:02:54,929 --> 01:02:57,830
We're not talking about shoes here.

1132
01:02:57,932 --> 01:03:00,162
Yeah, l know we're not.

1133
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,930
<i>Okay, that's why l thought
tonlght was our thlng.</i>

1134
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:06,905
You know, like we said, a
clean slate between me and you.

1135
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:11,673
l didn't care what anyone else did,
you know? We were more than that.

1136
01:03:11,779 --> 01:03:14,771
You didn't trust me.

1137
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:18,683
That's why l ended up in a
hospital with a cast on my--

1138
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,519
Look, let's just forget about all this.

1139
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:26,855
Oome on. l'm sorry, okay?
Let-let me make it up to you.

1140
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:32,365
No. No, just stop, all right? l don't
have anything else to say to you. Okay?

1141
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,130
<i>J ust go.</i>

1142
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:47,811
<i>Hey, Helen. Why aren't
you gettlng ready?</i>

1143
01:03:47,882 --> 01:03:49,816
Aren't you going to Stanford's game?

1144
01:03:49,884 --> 01:03:52,045
We're on an indefinite break.

1145
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:54,144
What-what happened?

1146
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:57,486
l said and did some pretty stupid stuff.

1147
01:03:57,558 --> 01:04:00,220
<i>You said and did some
pretty stupid stuff?</i>

1148
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:04,058
That's my girl. Runs in the family.

1149
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,156
You wanna talk about it?

1150
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:08,326
You don't wanna know.

1151
01:04:08,402 --> 01:04:13,965
Hey, l'm your dad.
Oome on, give me a try.

1152
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:18,171
We put sex pills in the punch in the party
and then Stanford ended up in the hospital

1153
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:21,146
with a raging boner
that wouldn't go down.

1154
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,310
Oan you please go back in time
and never tell me that story?

1155
01:04:26,387 --> 01:04:29,515
Dad, what's wrong
with me? l'm so stupid.

1156
01:04:31,025 --> 01:04:32,424
<i>l can't do anythlng rlght.</i>

1157
01:04:32,526 --> 01:04:35,427
Hey, come on, stuff happens.

1158
01:04:35,529 --> 01:04:39,989
Sometime your partner's
gonna end up in the hospital

1159
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:43,867
with his junk in a sling.

1160
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:45,667
<i>J unk?</i>

1161
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:48,207
U h, it's an old gym term.

1162
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:51,767
<i>Anyway, my polnt ls that you're
gonna make mlstakes ln llfe, you know</i>

1163
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:54,006
and there's just no avoiding it.

1164
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:57,949
You know, when l was 1 9,
l hitchhiked around Europe.

1165
01:04:58,018 --> 01:05:00,043
Everywhere.

1166
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,614
l slept in the park,
got drunk quite a bit.

1167
01:05:04,725 --> 01:05:06,886
Then l got robbed by gypsies.

1168
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:08,451
<i>- Gypsies?
- Yeah.</i>

1169
01:05:08,562 --> 01:05:10,792
They took my money,
my passport, and--

1170
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,460
but they didn't take my trombone,
which l considered a sign of respect.

1171
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,968
Well, it was the best
worst time of my life.

1172
01:05:17,071 --> 01:05:18,971
Wouldn't trade a minute of it.

1173
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,406
Why didn't you ever tell me
this kind of stuff sooner?

1174
01:05:22,476 --> 01:05:23,966
<i>l don't know.</i>

1175
01:05:24,044 --> 01:05:26,911
l wasn't ready.

1176
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:28,744
l was embarrassed.

1177
01:05:28,816 --> 01:05:30,545
l didn't want you to go.

1178
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,814
Hey. Here.

1179
01:05:38,759 --> 01:05:40,784
l got you this.

1180
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:43,957
Dad !

1181
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,429
Your mom is lovely

1182
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:51,994
and beautiful and funny and charming.

1183
01:05:52,072 --> 01:05:55,735
l hate her but you're gonna
get along great with her.

1184
01:05:55,809 --> 01:05:57,436
But,
um--

1185
01:05:57,511 --> 01:06:00,071
Are you gonna be okay without me?

1186
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:04,283
l'll be fine.

1187
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:15,294
<i>l'm gonna go flnd those
