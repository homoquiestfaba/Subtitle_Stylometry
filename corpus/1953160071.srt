00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
<b>  My father told me if I was hard enough, </b>

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
<b>  I wouldn’t break. </b>

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
<b>  He lied. </b>

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
<b>  Everything breaks. </b>

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Set!

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Hey Roy, 

00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,000
are you okay ?

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, hey!

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,500
29 36 60 All right.  

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,000
Turn around. Touch the ground.   
Get up. Everything gonna be ok.  

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
What the hell’s that ? 

00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
My uncle. 

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I’m here.

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What’s that accident? 

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,400
Didn’t Peyton tell you?

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
An accident? 

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What are you saying? 

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Roy, 

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,500
you-you look like the first time I saw Nelson. 

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He died. He got all smashed up, dead. 

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was a train. 
He was walking, 'cross the track. 

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,000
We don't have all the details yet. 

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
My boys. 

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
My little bunnies. 

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,000
Pink squirrel? 

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
No, thank you.

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't drink.

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I could make you a virgin one. 

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
It's just, um, I'm in training.

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,000
I see. 

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We all gotta get through these things somehow. 

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,500
I can't believe it's an open casket. 

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean it's awful how he died. 

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,900
Do you know, Mr. Chutney very well at all? 

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,900
No, not really. 

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
I gotta… 

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,500
Sorry. 

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He used to call me his little king.

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm his son. 

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Come on, babies. 
He's on the risin'. 

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
You ain't got none, 
you might as well pull your hands out of there. 

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
What the hell's going on? 

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Hard-on contest. 

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Bucks riding on the winner. 

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Hey, Chutney. 

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,450
Why don't you come on over here and, uh, 

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
drop trou.

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,700
Oh! No thanks, Russ. 

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't need to cir the jerk to long dick you. 

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Just ask your girlfriend!

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Just ask you mom's pussy!

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Pussy is right! 

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,300
Your red neck daddy's pussy to vote! 

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,00
They won't pay for your schoolin', 
let alone your football! 

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know, I would rather cut off my own damn arm, 
then cut any of you boys. 

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
But I’ve got to work. 

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,300
There's no J.V. this year. 
It's gone. 

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Now, some of you, will be varsity. 

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
And some of you. 

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
I posted the list outside. 

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,700
See your name on that list, 

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
be a good soldier,

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
and walk away. 

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,00
Coach?

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,00
I think there might be a little problem with the list. 

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,00
The list ? 

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,00
Chutney, look at you. 

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
You-you-you got no gumption. 

00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,00
You ain't angry enough. 

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,500
And I-I ain't got room, for "ain't angry enough ".

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Yeah, hey!

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
Roy Chutney. 

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Come on, dammit. 

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Football’s not where your life belongs. 

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Think of it as a blessing, it free's you up now.

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,500
You know, it's time to, to knuckle down, rebuild the corral, 
get this ranch back in working order. 

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This ranch, mom? 

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
This place is nothing like a ranch. 

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,100
This "nothing"  is everything Nelson left me with. 

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,500
This "nothing" and you. 

00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
This “nothing” and me, well... 

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm sorry you got stuck with me, mom. 

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,500
That's not what I meant. 

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You didn't even come to the funeral, mom. 

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, our divorce was funeral enough for me.

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Took you limp dicks long enough. 

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,500
You call this a wood pile? 

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
You call this tight? 

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,000
It's a god damn health hazard! 

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
It's loose!

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
It's all loose!

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,200
But, we spent all day on that! 

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, now you gonna spend all night doing it right. 

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,800
Yeah, like hell, you gonna pay us. 

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
Then we're gonna go downtown. 

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're not going anywhere. 

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Lem!  

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Tracy! 

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,700
Stop it! 

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So, what you gonna do? 

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,200
Kill me? 

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Who'd feed ya? 

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
Who'd buy ya Levi's? 

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,900
Lem!

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,600
Somebody says they call me  

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Swinging the world by a tail  

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,200
Bouncin' all over the white cloud  

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,900
Killin' the blues  

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,300
Hey, bro!

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,300
Are you okay?

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What are you grinning at? 

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,800
You, white boy, 

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,500
getting all Paul Bunyan back at Lem's. 

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,200
I'll tell you what was funny

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,100
was you and your dad doing the Appalachian boogie. 

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Hey. Lem's not my dad. 

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,800
Neither was mine. 

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, I hear ya. 

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,600
I only ever saw him at the football games. 

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
It doesn't really matter. 

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,600
Hard cheese about your father. 

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,300
Hard fuckin' cheese. 

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
My real pop,

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,900
he went after smoking some day.

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,300
And never came back. 

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Least he's still alive. 

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
I hope to think he is. 

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll see him around somewhere. 

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll walk up and say "pop"

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Can I hold a cig? 

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,900
You know, all nonchalant like. 

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,600
Then I'll kick his ass! 

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Do you ever tell yourself a story, Tracy? 

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,500
You start seeing the future as it's gonna happen. And…

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
…everything just gets broken. 

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Whoa! Down boy, coming at ya! 

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Down boy, coming at ya! 

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,00
Down boy, coming at ya! 

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,00
Laugh it up! 

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,800
Come on! 

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
Chuckle butt! 

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Chut, chut, chut, chut, buddy! Hey!

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,500
No man, varsity only. 

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
That shines are, uh, with our team spirit. 

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,300
Give me a break, Russ, okay? 

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000 
Sorry, Chutney. 

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,500
Hey, it's nothing personal, you know?

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
It's just a ritual. 

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,800
Personal? It's not even human. 

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,600
Think I'm kidding, weak tit? 

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,800
That's enough! 

00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,500
Does the baby want his bottle? 

00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, fuck you. 

00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, yeah? 

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,000
You got a bottle for me? 

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
Are you okay, man? 

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,000
You burned my fuckin' jacket! 

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
What the shit? 

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Come on, fucker! Get up! 

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Whoa! What happened to the moonshine? 

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,950
Fuckin' pussy. 

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Are you okay? 

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Hey, Roy! 

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where’re you going, Roy? 

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,800
<i> Ladies and gentlemen it's Keno time. </i>
<i> So let's go. </i>

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey paper Blue Springs gazette. 
 
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,500
Tomorrow's news today. 

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
<i> 24! </i>

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,100
Oh no, what did I drag my sleeves through this time? 

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I've only been here two hours, and look at how dirty I am.

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh, shoot, Gretch' you're dirty long before you came in tonight. 
 
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, Gid. 

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,700
Hey, you ought to, uh,

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,400
get you some brains. 

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Excuse me? 

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Cow brains, bub. 
Scrambled on up, with eggs. 

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Yeah, man's meal.

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,400
He needs them in eggs, Gretch', for my boy, Roy here. 

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Chutney, right? You are Roy Chutney? 

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
Yeah. How'd you know that? 

00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Uh, my name's Gideon Ferguson. 

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,100
Gid to my friends. 

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh. And everybody's my friend. 

00:16:05,10 --> 00:16:07,500
I sell the paper, right man. 

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
We get the paper at home. 

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Oh, we get the paper at home. 

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Now, Gid's not here trying to increase the circulation. 

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
No.

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I’ve seen you practice. 

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Uh, watch your football. 

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,100
A long time. 

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,500
Well, not long enough. 

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I got cut. 

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I know you did.

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,900
That's why Gid wants to jaw at ya. 

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Barn's throwing up a football team. 

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He wants gamers, from all over town. 

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,100
Boys like you. 

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, boys… with touch. 

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Yeah. 

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,800
Well, we're talking full on tackle football. 

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We're talking six-man. 

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,000
Six-man, isn't like a ranch kid game? 

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, isn't that what you is, a ranch kid? 

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,000
That's the last thing I am.

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,300
Oh, no, it ain't a thing to be shameful of. 

00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,300
Well, ranch kids are tough. 

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
You have to be. 

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
You raise a pet pig, then you kill it. 

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
We-we don’t raise pigs.

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, well the point is, 

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,500
town kids don't know if they're tough. 

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,100
In six-man, in six-man, you got no place to hide. 

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,500
No, you miss a tackle. And boom! 

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,500
Yeah, scary to some kids, bub, it's scary! 

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,100
Long night, that’s all. 

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,600
No-no, that's all right. Shh, shh, shh. 

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,500
This offer, 

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
it ain't open to every swinging dick. 

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Come on. 

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
Roy? You wanna shine? 

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
You wanna watch motlow's pretty boys, from the stands? 

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Or you wanna be my quarterback? 

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,800
What you got to loose? 

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
See ya. 

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,500
You all right, Ms. Bowser? 

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah. 

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,500
Just your ordinary everyday heartbreak. 

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Oh, is that all?  

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
Well, I thought it might be something serious. 

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
<i> Now, we have 64 and that looks good.</i>

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
This ain't my first rodeo, Chunt. 

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,200
I hail from west Texas. 

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,200
Six-man's a religion down there. 

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I speak it's tongues. 

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
That's good. 

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
Why me?  

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,500
You got your daddy's blood. 

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
And that's good blood. 

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
You know-knew my dad? 

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
I told you, Gid knows everybody. 

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
Your daddy was a mighty fine ball player. 

00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
All state three years running.

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He was a real… 

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,800
sledgehammer, sledgehammer, yeah.

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,500
I've heard that before. 

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,100
Course you only knew smash my arm. 

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
He was just a… 

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
tackle…

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,450
grunt…

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
like me.

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
But you,

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,500
Roy,

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're better than that.


00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,500
Six-man, it takes smarts. 

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,500
You get to run a gun, you get to think on your feet. 

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
What do you get? 

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, I get to coach again, bub. 

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
Yeah. I get to be bull-goose.

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,000
Now I'll run my boys against any action in the state. 

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,000
And if you sign, you got a cannon,

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,000
right there. 

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
Boom, boom, boom. 

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,100
Roy.

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,000
You can own this game. 

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,800
You can have somethin' 

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that nobody ever gonna take away from you. 

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,200
You're my lynchpin. 

00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,000
Without ya, I got no team. 

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,900
You in? 

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hey, Skyla. 

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Gid 

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Gid

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Please bud,

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,600
will you stick me in?

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
Floyd! Come on, sit down. 

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
<i> 5, we have a winner.</i>

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,100
You look awful ragged. 

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Ragged, did you say? 

00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,900
“Ragged but right”, Riley Puckett, 1934.

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't mind, Floyd. 

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,000
His…his diabetes and his drinking
just disagree. 

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Folks call me Studebaker, 

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
'cause I live in one. 

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But, my name's Floyd. 

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
What do you go by, mister? 

00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,100 
Roy. 

00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,200
He's Roy Chutney. 

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,000
My new quarterback, right champ? 

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000 
You know that's trouble sure and true kid. 

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000 
Nothing but trouble. 

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,500 
Oh, “nothing but trouble”, Floyd, Lonnie Johnson, 1949. 

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,000 
So, how 'bout it, son? You in? 

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000 
Yeah! 

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100 
Yeah!

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,000 
Atta boy! 

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000 
Yes, sir! 

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000 
Yes, sir. 

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000 
All right, listen up. 

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000 
In six-man,  

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,900
you never stop moving.

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500 
It's high-octane, hardscrabble. 

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800 
You got to be, 

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,500
outlaw, out there.

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,500 
You got to be Renegade. 

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500 
Let's get friendly. 

00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,900 
Over there, this is, uh, 

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600 
Quirky Lovoy. 

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,800 
He'll put you on the back of your helmet. 

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
This is Josh Coudrow. 

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
He's our special teams. 	

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Now this is, uh,

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Jeremy Areala. 

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,900
Got 

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,100
Dave Bishop here. 

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
A hard time, getting a helmet over that hat. 

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,900
Down there, 

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Warren Hudson. 

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We got us, 

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Benton Toranjos. 

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Mr. wrong way, Toranjo. 

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,500
And Lester and Earl Bucket. 

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Now they're new to football, 

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,500
but their old man owns this field. 

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,550
So be nice. 

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,100
Now, Gibbs, he played six-man, 

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,300
right? At Valley Christian.

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,400
Yeah.

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,000
'til he left the team for, um,

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,500
well religious reasons. 

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,100
What's that? 

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
I called the coach a cock sucker.

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,100
And hidden over here, this is Roy Chutney. 

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,600
He's our big boss with the hot sauce. 

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,500
He's our bull-roar, our deepback.

00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Gid, uh.

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This helmets are ancient.

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,500
Oh, be broadminded, boy. 

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's not the helmet, it's what fits inside. 

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
All right, where's that ball?

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Okay, now deepback. 

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,200
He's just a, he's just a quarterback but don't get the hike. 

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,400
He gets the ball through a-a hand off or a pitch. 

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That way he's always got the option to throw or to run. 

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,900
That's it, Roy. 

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Run it again. Run it again, keep it going. 

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Now, all of you. 

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
You're always eligible to receive a pass.

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,900
So always be on your ready. 

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Now remember chums.

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
In six-man, a broken play may just be your best bet. 

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Go, go, go, that's it! 

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,500
Yeah, you got it! 

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
Let's play some football. 

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,500
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
Now, get down there. 

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Now, hike, stand back. 

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Come on, come on. 

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Strip it away, strip it away. Strip it away. 

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh! Now it's play it.

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
That's it.

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey Roy, take your office. I’m uh…

00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,000
I got some business needs tending too. 

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
All right, Gid. 

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
All right, let's run it again! 

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hey, Jute. 

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,500
Been a long time. 

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,900
You got that buying money? 

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,500
Yes indeedy, you got me some games? 

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,700
Oh, we got you some games, Gid. 

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600 
Scheduled your team in all the off slots. 

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,800
All the by-weeks, huh? 

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, that's what I reckoned. Here you go. 

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
'Course we still have another problem.   

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Oh yeah, what’s it? 

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Yeah, I'll be blunt, Gid. 

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That trouble you got into up at Hishem. 

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,900
That boy that died.

00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,900
You know that wasn't my fault. 

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,500
Yeah, now don't get your jaws…

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,500
Jute, it's blasphemy. 

00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,550
I did my best. 

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,500
Yeah, hell I know you did! 

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But, it’s just it… 

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,900
Yeah they're asking for some insurance. 

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,500
Some insurance?

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah. You mean, cash? 

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Every game? 

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Every game. 

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,000
Cash on the barrelhead. 

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Louvin Brothers, 1954. 

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,000
What? 

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Nothing but a song in my head. 

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,100
We're gonna whop you up in geralee. 

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,500
Well, I don't know about that, 

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,200
but you're more than welcome to try. 

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
We got us some games. 

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,500
We got us some games! 

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,00
Come in here, everybody in. Everybody in! 

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,900
And one last thing!

00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,900
The slaughter rule! 

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,000
If either team gets ahead by 45 points, they call the game. 

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,500
But, Gideon Ferguson, he never been slaughter ruled.

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,100
And I aim to keep it that way. 

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay? 

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,100
Today, I was in uh, I was in ceramics class.

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,100
And up comes Motlow. 

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,500
“So what have we made today, Mr. Two Dogs”

00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,900
And I said “ma-many things for flowers”

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,500
“Mr. Two Dogs, that-that's not a vase.” 

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,500
“It’s a water pipe.”

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
"Nuh-huh, that-that's not a water pipe." 

00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,500
“Today, Mr. Motlow,

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
we had made a bung.”

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,500
No, you didn’t!

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, he went ape shit.

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,900
“Two Dogs ! Your piece of reservation! Trash!”

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,500
“Get out of my room. Pronto tonto”

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah. That racist fuck. 

00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,900
So I decked him. 

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You hit him? 

00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,700 
You'll see I left a big old clay mark on his face. 

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, then he, then he kicked me out of the team. 

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,300
Perfect!

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,100
Now you can go play six-man with me. 

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Yeah? 

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
Does your old lady go for younger men? 

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Shut up. 

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,000
Hi, Mrs. Chutney.

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,290
Hi, guys. 

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,100
Smells good.

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Thanks. 

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,500
Okay, if I stay for dinner? 

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, of course. 

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,500
Mind you this isn't all for tonight 

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,500
this is two weeks worth. 

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,100
Can I stay for two weeks then? 

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Two weeks! You just got here. 
 
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,500
Roy, look

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I’ve got to come back to Montreal. 

00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,200
So, you know 

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,400
a three day layover in Montreal.

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,900
And Francis got tickets for the hockey game and…

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Francis?

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Which one is he? 

00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,500
He's the rancher one? The professor one?

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,900
He's the pilot one, honey. 

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,500
The pilot one.  

00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Mind you, you better fix that corral by the time I get back, or else. 

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
Or else what? 

00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,500
Or else they'll be spankings. 

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,500
Oh. Count me in. 

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I got it. 

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
Hello. 

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,000
Hey, champ’, you got a minute? 

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,400
Hey. 

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
How you doing?

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,200
Yeah, I wanted to jaw jack with you 'bout the game. 

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Okay.

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:21,500
Yeah, we got leave 10:00 a.m. sharp. 

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,500
Okay.

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,500
We're going up to Augusta, weather gets kind of squirrelly, so, uh... 

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
you come prepared, eh? 

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,500
You got it. 

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,400
Okay. 

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,300
What? 

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
It's uh, it's about your rent. 

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
By, Tuesday the government check get in. 

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,100
Nothing doing 'til Tuesday. 

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Just asking. 

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Just telling. 

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
One more thing, Roy. 

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,500
Can I count on you for a ride? 

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, for Saturday sure. 

00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,000
No, I mean every game. Can I, uh, 

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,000
can I, uh, can I depend on you for that? Can I trust you?

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah, sure. 

00:28:55,5000 --> 00:28:57,000
10:00 A.m. sharp. 

00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,200
See you then. 

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
That’s our football coach? 

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Yep. 

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Big Gid. Big  Gid. Big Gid.

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,200
Man I heard that guy's some kind of a pre-vert. 

00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:15,500
A pre-vert? 

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,100
Yeah. 

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,500
Well, Lem said he's a funny. 

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, Lem don't know his ass from his elbow. 

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,500
Right. 
Come on. 

00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:25,100
Is he? Is he kind of funny? 

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,900
Sure wanna welcome all you folks. 

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,700
For being here today, we're sure lookin' forward to this football game. 

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,500
Um, if you noticed over there, the cheerleaders having a cupcake sale today. 

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,000
I wanted to congratulate the Anderson's on the birth of their new son.

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,500
It's nice to have another boy in town. 

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,500
Six man-football, we need all the boys we can get. 

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,000
We're really looking forward to this game, between the Elks and the Renegades. 

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
No that ain't a hike. 

00:30:01,200 --> 00:29:03,500
That ain't a hike, that's a pass.  

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
He's gonna pull a reverse! 

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's a reverse! 

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,100
It's alrigh’. We're okay.

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,500
We just gotta buck up now. 

00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
We’ve got to … play real.

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,300
West Texas pig iron, wing set. 

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,900
We'll spread it wide in the flats, cross screen.

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,600
And we're gonna lead block. 

00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
You get me, huh? 

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Now, Roy,

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
you jack like that, 

00:30:52,900 --> 00:27:54,000
out of the pocket too soon. 

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,000
I need you to take a hit one time, okay? 

00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,100
I need you to be my, alpha wolf out there. 

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,200
Yeah, that's it.  

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,090
Hey, Benton? 

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,200
Don't just look pretty, you gotta bust me a seam, okay? 

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,800
Trayce

00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Coudrow.

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,200
You're my wings out there, so fly, all right? 

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,400
Right.

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,300 
Let's double up on two. Ready? 

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,500
Let's do this! 

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Get him!

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
Yeah, here we go.

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,400
So close!  

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,100
Go, Tracy! 

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,100
All right?

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,500
Come on- come on- come on. 

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
All right, is his mama or papa around? 

00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,100
Okay, he's okay, he's all right. 

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,500
He's a tough boy. He's a tough boy. 
Come on. 

00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,300
Yeah, don't let your head get too swelled, huh?  

00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,300
Too late! 

00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,000
Go! Go, Two Dogs! Move outta the way! 

00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Yeah, how do you like the Renegades now? 

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
That’s it! That’s it! 

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That’s it! 
That’s my sneaky sneaky boys. 

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,000
Yes, sir! Yeah! 

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,500
What are you doing? 

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
having a spaz attack? 

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm warming up the old larynx. 

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,300
Singing tomorrow, genuine juke joint music. 

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,500
What? You sing? 

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,000
Is a frog's ass water tight? 

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
Yeah, me and Floyd we gotta gig Saturday night. 

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Why don't you come on out? 

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,100
Uh, tomorrow?  

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,500
I don't know. 

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You know that gal you was making eyes at the other night.

00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Ms Skyla? 

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,500
What the girl? The girl at the diner? 
 
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,100
Well, you bet your sweet cherry pie she'll be there. 

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah?  

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Howdy, partner. 

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Hey. 

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,300
What can I give for you? 

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Whisky

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
with some water and some ice. 

00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,800
A ditch? 

00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
What? 

00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,100
The drink you ordered is called a ditch.

00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Is it a ditch water irrigation…?

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Oh, yeah. 

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Yeah I didn't know if you knew…

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,300
What are you ? A rancher or something? 

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,500
I'd say you're the cowpoke. 

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,300
Don't I know you?

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
Uh, Pink squirrel?

00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,300
Right, the funeral thing. 

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Sorry. 

00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,600
I keep forgetting Mr. Chutney was your father. 

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,000
He kept forgetting too.

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,500
So, how you holding up? 

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
I-i-i could, I could really 

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,600
use that Ditch. 

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
'kay. 

00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Are you, um, 

00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,000
breaking training tonight? 

00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Hey! 

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,500
I’ve just finished my shift. 
And I gotta close you out. 

00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,500
Oh, it’s okay. 

00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Come on! 

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Check out in my ass.

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,300
Where did you learn all that? 

00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,400
It’s just uh 

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
it’s just I've always been my mom's dancing dummy. 

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,900
Oh, you are no dummy. 

00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
You're more of a sweetie. 

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,500
I’m sorry. 

00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
I just mean 

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,500
just that your eyes aren't hard. 

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,500
They’re more serious, 

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,500
just like they're hurt. 

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,000
That's just the smoke, that's all. 

00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Gid can sing! 

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,900
Oh, you know Gideon? 

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Oh, yeah. 

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I came here to see him.

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,500
Really want to see you, but.

00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Do you wanna dance?

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
No, um 

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Slow songs are 

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,100
Like whisky in milk? 

00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,000
Uh, that drink’s called the Cowboy. 

00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Oh, it is? 

00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
Who drinks Cowboys? 

00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
Old-timers mostly. 

00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,000
Guys like, Floyd over there? 

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Yeah.  

00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,500
Poor Floyd has a hard time keeping his cowboys in line. 

00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,300
You can't just come up here. Come on, come on, okay? 

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,700
You can't abandon me. You…

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,300
You can't ignore me…

00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,500
‘cause of this… 

00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,500
this boy! 

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,500
Floyd, will you just god damn sit down! 

00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,400
Floyd, you're drunk. 

00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Just sit your butt down and shut up. 

00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,100
Sit down. Sit down.

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,300
Floyd, just… 

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,000
Whoa, you're getting your money's worth tonight, folks! 

00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
Let's do something a little quicker. 

00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Go on. 

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Go help Gid out. 

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,900
Give me a call some time. 

00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,100
It’s 5, 6, 9 …

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
It tickles? 

00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,500
Yeah. 

00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,500
Call me. 

00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,900
Okay. 

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,500
Good-bye. 

00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Hey, Floyd! 

00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,700
Floyd you in here? 

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,900
No?

00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Floyd? 

00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Mr. Studebaker?

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Hey!

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,000
They're worried about ya.

00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
You kind of ran off back there. 

00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,000
Come on. 

00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, officer I didn't, I didn't see how fast I was going. 

00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,200
Gid, send you after me? 

00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,600
You his errand boy? 

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,8000
I'm not Gid's anything. 

00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,200
It's football boys like you what shrunk him down. 

00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,900
When I met him, he was tiny. 

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,100
Only yay-big. 

00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,000
He's been getting back to full size. 

00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,500
But he still got inside troubles. 

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,000
I don't, I don't know what you're talking about. 

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,000
He likes to think he looks after me, but it's the other way around. 

00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,100
“Rank strangers”, Albert E. Brumley, 1954. 

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
That's a good song. 

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
Yeah. 

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Will you take me to my Maybelle. 

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
She's parked up here a ways. 

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Oh. Oh. 

00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,500
Maybelle's your car? 

00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,300
Maybelle's my everything. 

00:41:37,0100 --> 00:41:39,000
The police are always trying to move me along. 

00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,000
The hardest part is trying to stay clean. 

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,700
Folks stare when I change clothes. 

00:41:460,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Free show. Free show. 

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,300
I'm just trying to square things a-okay with the lord. 

00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,000
That sounds like a good plan. 

00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Will you stick me?

00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,500
Mister.

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,900
Please? 

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,500
I can't do me, myself. 

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah, okay, sure. 

00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Aim away from the blood. 

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,900
Shoot, give me a heart attack.

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,100
Blood you say? 

00:42:30,1500 --> 00:42:31,100
That's easy! 

00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,500
“Will Jesus wash he bloodstains from your hands”, remember? 

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,500
Oh, of course I remember. 

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
Crazy monkey. 

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Hazel Dickens, 1964. 

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,100
Go on, Roy. 	

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,300
Just ease her on in. 

00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Floyd, 

00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
you are your own worst enemy. 

00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Why are you doing this to yourself? 

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,100
My weakness is stronger than I am. 

00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,100
Sorry to drag you away from your gal. 

00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,600
That's okay. 

00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
I got her number. 

00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Yeah, good for you. 

00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,100
Right here. 

00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,000
No, you didn't. 

00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,000
Damn it! 

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,200
Ain't that just kiss my ass? 

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,500
I lost my gig, 

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,100
you lost your girl. 

00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,000
You can still make a mark on the night. 

00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,900
You know, my dad used to do this all the time? 

00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,000
He used to tell me stories about rabid freights and 

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,100
going out to Canada, each spring,
or, out to winachi for apple harvest. 

00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,500
Lord knows I know that circuit. 

00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,500
Yeah? 

00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,500
Yes. 

00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,900 
He said it's how he first came to Blue Springs.

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,000
He just sort of, just got off to stretch his legs and never left. 

00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,000
You know, maybe he wasn't trying 

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
to kill himself. 

00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Maybe, he was just 

00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
leaving. 

00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Just trying to go back the way he came. 

00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Just

00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,900
Just judged the timing wrong. 

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,500
Yeah. 

00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,100
Only Hanks I know live in the jukebox. 

00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,100
Well you got, Hank Williams, of course. 

00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,900
And, uh, Hank Thompson 

00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,200
F 1 and F 2, and 

00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,400
Hank Snow

00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,500
E

00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,500
3

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,600
I mean he's the-he's the ultimate ranger. 

00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,000
Do you know him? 

00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,900
Oh, gosh. 

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,900
I'll make you a deal. 

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
You tell me what the problem is, 

00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,900
and I'll tell you how to fix it. 

00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,000
I guess the only thing you could do is lie to me. 

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,700
You could

00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,000
tell me a story. 

00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
that you

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,500
are not from here. 

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,100
Okay. 

00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,700
And um, 

00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,300
and you're gonna take me far, far away. 

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm not from around here. 

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And, uh

00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,000
my truck’s parked out back. 

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And I think I got enough gas to get us to Moose Jaw. 

00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,800
Oh, that boy. 

00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,100
Have you boys seen your coach today? 

00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,100
That's it, forfeit, red! 

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,300
Forfeit, red! 

00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,700
Victory lap, gentlemen.  

00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah, you better run you chicken shits!  

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,500
Smear the queer- smear the queer! 

00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Cannonball comin' at you. 

00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,300
You, lovebirds, get a room. 

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,500
Hey, hey, hey, Bison!  

00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,500
Give it up, ya'll! 

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Bison, more like Buffalo chips. 

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,200
Yeah. 

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,400
Paper, Blue Springs gazette! Get your paper. 

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Paper, Blue Springs gazette! 

00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,100
Yeah.

00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,500
Tomorrow's news tonight. 

00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm gonna go see a man about a horse. 

00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Hey, paper, paper!

00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,100
Look at this tomorrow's new tonight. 

00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
Bison win divisional’s. 

00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,800
That’s right. 

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,300
Give me the damn paper. 

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,400
What's the idea? 

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,600
Hi, Gid. 

00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,700
Yeah, hey! 

00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,100
You gettin' all hoity-toity on me? 

00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,900
What are you talking about? 

00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,900
I'm talking about you god damn supposed to pick me up, before the game! 

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Yeah.

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Okay, I'm sorry. 

00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,500
I wanted to talk to you about that, I just…

00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,100
I was running late and my-my rig she. 

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,500
Oh. 

00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,000
You a liar, Roy? 

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,800
You connin' old Gid? 

00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Okay. 

00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,400
I don't know what… I was, I was with Skyla. 

00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, girls got no truck with me. 

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,400
You and me, we had a deal. 

00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,990
Yeah, Gid, but, 

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,500
I'm your quarterback, not your taxi. 

00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,000
You cost us that game. 

00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
And that game cost me plenty. 

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,500
And I'm really sorry. 

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,500
It won't happen again, I promise. 

00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Okay? 

00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,500
I'm gonna get back. 

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
What? 

00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
You're having yourself quite a time, right? 

00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,100
Yeah. 

00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,600
I guess you could say that. 

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
Say it. I can smell it. 

00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,100
Yeah. 

00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,000
You got the thirst, and soon it's got you. 

00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,100
I've seen it happen to my mama. 

00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,950
And I seen it happen to Floyd. 

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And there won't be no one what's a stranger to you. 

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,100
And there won't be no one who can trust you, either! 

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Cause you are poisoned in your gut! 

00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,900
And you're poisoned in your liver, and you're poisoned in your heart. 

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And you're poisoned in your brain. 

00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,100
Hell, Gid. It's a couple of beers, that's all. 

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,100
Come here. Wait.

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,700
Gid's got something he wants to show you. 

00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,900
Here. 

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,000
Gid, what the fuck?

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,950
No wait a minute, Roy. God damn it. 

00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
Roy, just, would you just quit squirming! 

00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,500
What?! 

00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Look, I just wanted to show you my scar. 

00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,100
There! 

00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,900
Now, ain't it a beaut', huh? 

00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,100
Yeah, I was born with a large heart. 

00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,000
Rittled up veins. 

00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, my mama, she pickled me. 

00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,800
She pickled me up good, 
when I was still a pup, up inside her. 

00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,700
And there’s a few beers for you. 

00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,900
Now, what about you, huh, Roy? 

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You committed? 

00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,100
Are you trustworthy, Roy? 

00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Yes. 

00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,900
It's not possible to live in this world without trust, Roy. 

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Okay. 

00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,100
Okay. 

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
Excuse me. 

00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,100
Mr. Ferguson, can I get a paper? 

00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
What? 

00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,100
Can I get a paper? 

00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,400
A paper,

00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,500
yep. 

00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,800
Yo, Chutney! 

00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,000
You see the game tonight? 

00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,100
No when we won.

00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,500
It was a bitch though man we lost Devo and Tulliver. 

00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,500
It's too bad. It's a rough game. 

00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,900
I'm telling you there's a spot on the team for you. 

00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,100
For divisionals. 

00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,000
I mean, it's not backfield, but it's varsity. 

00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,000
I've something better going on. 

00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,000
Hey, come on, Roy. 

00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,700
We need you. 

00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,900
No, thank you. 

00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
Nothing personal. 

00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,000
You'd rather play for him? 

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,800
Oh, I think it's very personal, Roy. 

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Russ, don't. 

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,000
You hear that, boys? 

00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,000
Chutney, here, would rather play for his fuck buddy. 

00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800 
What's the name of your team again? 

00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:25,490
Was it

00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,000
the blow jobbers, huh? 

00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,500
Pole smokers, wasn't it? 

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,500
Uh-huh, no, not this time chief. 

00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,200
Fuck off! 

00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,000
Leave him alone, fuckin’ asshole! 

00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Come on!

00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,500
Roy! 
Come on! 

00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,000
Get my boys outta! I said, get out! 

00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
You stay out of this, Gid. 

00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,000
This isn't your concern anymore! 

00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,900
Get out of here. 

00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,500
Go. 

00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,500
Oh, I'm sorry. 

00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Are you okay? 

00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:48,900
Kiss it better. 

00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,000
Women get all wet, for a black eye! 

00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah? 

00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,050
Yep. 

00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,200
You bet your ass that

00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,400
Skyla's got some wild in her. 

00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,500
Is she your girl, Roy?

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,900
I don’t know.

00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,800
I can't really tell ya.

00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,500
Ohhhh. You can tell old Gid. 

00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,100
You got ya some, didn't ya?  

00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,900
Oh yeah.

00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,100
You got you some, sweet gherkin. 

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah, some pop tart. 

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,500
What happened to that paw of yours? 

00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,500
I didn't see you land no punches. 

00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,500
Oh, yeah and why's that, Gid? 

00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,400
Hey!

00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,800
That was my fight! 

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,100
I didn't need you to butt in. 

00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,900
No? What’s this?

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,900
I was just looking out for the team. 

00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Fine. 

00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,000
But, I can take care of myself, all right? 

00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,100
Oh, sure you can bub. 

00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,500
Yeah, guess I'm just a mother hen, sometimes. 

00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,400
Come upstairs we're gonna retape this before the game. 

00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,800
But we gotta, um, meet Tracy. 

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, it won't take but a jiffy. 

00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, sorry things ain't balmy. 

00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,000
Didn't think it'd get this cold, this early. 

00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
Cold, it…

00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It don't bother me much but… 

00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,000
well, Floyd he don't got the skin for it. 

00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
Oh, hell,

00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,500
I got manners enough to fed grits to a grizzly. 

00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,800
You, uh, you

00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,800
want some mud? 

00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,900
Some what? 

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,900
Some hot pip before the game? 

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,800
Sure, yeah.  

00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Hey, Hank Snow. 

00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,900
Yeah, what? 

00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,000
Oh! Those are my chums, Roy. 

00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,800
What all I come home to. 

00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Yeah, a song you love will never let you down. 

00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Okay.

00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Let's see about that hand, come on. 

00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,500
Sit down over here. 

00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
So, tell me.

00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,900
Two Dogs, how do you figure? 

00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,900
He had nine stitches, in his neck. 

00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Russ had on his class ring. 

00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,900
Yeah , Russ,

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,100
that punk's crying to mama now. 

00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,000
Put the fear of Gid into him! 

00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,500
Just shake it off.  

00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Hey, I know…

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,500
what Russ said about you, the way what he called you.

00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,200
That's not the first time I've heard that. 

00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,300
Well, listen, Chutney, 

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,700
get this clear. 

00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,800
I ain't a man who wants other men. 

00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,500
I just like being around men, 

00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,550
in their company. 

00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,900
It's what I know. 

00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's all I've ever known. 

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,300
But you go for women, right? 

00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,500
Just 'cause, just 'cause Tracy and all them think…

00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Well, let them think it! 

00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
You and me, we know better ? 

00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,100
Yeah. 

00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,900
Would you have come here, if

00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
if you thought that?  

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Why did you come here, Roy? 

00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, 'cause we gotta game, remember? 

00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,000
We got a game, 'member! 

00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Listen. 

00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
You don't trust me. 

00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,500
And you never will,

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,200
Unless I give you my trust first. 

00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,000
So, I'm giving you it.  

00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Just don’t let me down!

00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Again. 

00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
I won't. 

00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,200
Thank you. 

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, the only truth is 

00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,200
I’ve never been with a woman.

00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And I ain't paid straight up for her. 

00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,900
And whores don't count.

00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,900
Now/or, do they?
 
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,200
Oh I’m a man. 

00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
But 

00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,900
I ain’t never been

00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,100
kissed. 

01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,000
I ain't ever been with nobody. 

01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,000
Oh, Russ, he thinks he knows something about being a man. 

01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
He doesn't! 

01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
No child knows what a man is. 

01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,500
No child can say a damn thing about me. 

01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,000
No child, no man has that right. 

01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,000
Do you think Tracy will know that we're up here? 

01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Roy,

01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,900
you know much about roughnecking? 

01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,900
Roughnecking? 

01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,500
Ever know anybody that worked the oil fields? 

01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:052,500
You know the hits I took? 

01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,500
You know the miles, the, uh,

01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the hours, the hours of my life? 

01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,000
Tell me something, you remember-you remember what, uh,

01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
that first, uh, 

01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
that first, uh, good hit. 

01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,900
First good stick, come here! 

01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,600
What are ou talking about? ‘bout this !

01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,800
What'd that feel like, bud? 

01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It wakes you up! 

01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,000
Hell yes, it wakes you up! 

01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,200
Good morning! 

01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,800
Gets you all fired up, eh? 

01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,900
Feels good! 

01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:18,500
Yeah.

01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,500
It puts blood in mouth! 

01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,000
It puts blood in your mouth. 

01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,200
That's right!

01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,900
It tastes good, don't it?

01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,100
Sure it do. 

01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
In my life, 

01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,900
I can't put it back the way it was. 

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,500 
Mingus, Marathon, and whore in Odessa. 

01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,000
Odessa, god damn, Odessa was the worst. 

01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,500
Moxy Ferguson, have you ever heard of her? 

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
My mother. 

01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,100
Yep, my old lady. 

01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,700
She's a crooner. 

01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,900
Couple of her records around here. 

01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,900
She put me in an orphanage, Roy. 

01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,900
She was a god damn tramp! 

01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,100
Alcohol ruined her! 

01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,150
And something else, 

01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,200
I don't know what it was.

01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Something, 

01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,800
something, 

01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,650
money, 

01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,700
maybe,

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,450
pride, I won't know what it was,

01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,000
ruined your father. 

01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,400
But you, Roy, 

01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,600
you aren't ruined. 

01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,500
You can hold on to that taste, that blood in your mouth. 

01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,000
You can use it, to hit back, Roy. 

01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,300
You can hit back. 

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
Hit back harder! 

01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,500
Hit back harder!

01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
That’s the way you do it, Roy! 

01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,500
You hit back, harder, Roy like that. You see that! 

01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,400
Hit back harder! Like that! 

01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,500
That's how you do it! 

01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,500
All right? 

01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,100
You’re gonna

01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,600
You’re gonna hear

01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,500
 some stories

01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,300
about me. 

01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,500
Stories about a boy

01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
who had got killed. 

01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,200
Only he didn't get killed. 

01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,500
He died. 

01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,500
He just died. 

01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,500
He's still with me. He’s…

01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,000
Where's your father, Roy? 

01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
He's dead, Gid. 

01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,700
Yeah, well sure he is but, where is he? 

01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:10,500
He's dead, Gid, he's buried. 

01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Roy, no, he's here, Roy. 

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,200
He's your fear. 

01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,100
Now you can use that fear, Roy. 

01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,100
Or you can let it eat your heart.

01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,200
You comprende amigo? 

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,100
Yeah, okay. 

01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,700
Then, prove it. 

01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:31,400
Then, prove it. 

01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
Good.

01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,500
Get by me. 

01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,100
I don't wanna do this, Gid.

01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,000
Come on! Get by me! 

01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,700
Gid, I don’t wanna do this.

01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,800
I'll stick you. No, no, no, no, I'll stick ya. 

01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,900
This is stupid. 

01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,500
It is not stupid! 

01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,900
Come on, use your fear now! 

01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh, you want it? 

01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,200
Okay, shake yourself loose. Come on.

01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,100
Hut, hut, hut, hut!  

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,500
No, now don't throw your legs out like a little girl! 

01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,500
Use your hips, Roy! 

01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,500
Use your hips! 

01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,500
Now is that it ? 

01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,500
Is that your best go? 

01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,500
Yep. 

01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,500
You win, okay? 

01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,500
Okay. 

01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,500
No, no, no. 

01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,600
You can let me go now. 

01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,500
Why did they kill my, my beautiful boy? 

01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Will you stop touching me, please? 

01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,500
Please, get off of me! 

01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Just get the fuck, off of me! 

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Damn it! 

01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,000
What I just…

01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,500
Oh, Jesus, I don’t…

01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:01,000
I didn't mean nothing by it! I just,

01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,500
I just thought maybe you’re someone to

01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,500
to hold you. 

01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,500
Oh I don’t know what God did to me. I just…

01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,900
hold, see…

01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,900
What’s that ?

01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Roy, come on.

01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:16,500
Okay?

01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,000
What you're afraid of ?  

01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,600
'fraid of a little rough housing? 

01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,000
Men do that, you know? 

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,200
Athletes! 

01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,300
Yes they do. They hug each other! 

01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,000
And they hi-five! 

01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
You know! They slap asses. 

01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,500
It's different Gid! 

01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,100
No! 

01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:34,900
It's different and you know it is! 

01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:35,500
No, it ain't different! 

01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,500
And you know it is! 
It ain’t different.

01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,500
It ain't different! Roy!

01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,500
If you just trusted me! 

01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
If you trusted me, Roy! 

01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,450
Hey. 

01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,500
If you just…

01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,550
What's going on in here?

01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,500
A little game of wild hared grab ass. 

01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,000
Up yours, Two Dogs. 

01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,000
You're fuckin' late, you fuckin' drive. 

01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,100
Roy. 

01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,500
Oh, it's okay, Two Dogs. It's okay. 

01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,900
I'm sorry. 

01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,900
This place has seen better days. 

01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,000
No, it hasn’t. 

01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,500
How would you know? 

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Duh Chutney,

01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,300
I grew up here.

01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
Let's go Trace. 

01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000 
Oh, come on, let’s get this game going. 

01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,000
Hey, fellas, you know what, this ain't Texas. 

01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
All right, all right, come in here. 

01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,500
Come in here. All right. 

01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,600
Clean slate now. 

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,900
Uh, forget it ever happened. 

01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So, uh, I'm uh, I'm soft on you. 

01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,500
You're soft on them. 

01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,500
Our new games, gonna be, uh, smash mouth. 

01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,500
Anvil formation, you drive a fish down their throat! 

01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,500
Two Dogs, you with us?

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
100%, rock and roll! 

01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,500
They're too proud. 

01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,400
Keep them in the hole,

01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,000
they'll give up. 

01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,100
Fuck with their heads, 

01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,700
and you'll fuck with their hearts. 

01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
All right. 

01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Go for their heart. 

01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,500
Go for their heart, let's have some pride. 

01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,600
Let's have some pride! 

01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,700
Let’s have some pride! 

01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,500
You got that renegade pride? Yes, woo! 

01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,500
You got that renegade pride! Good god, yes, woo!

01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,800
When I say renegade you say pride! 

01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,900
Renegade! Pride! Renegade! Pride !

01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,500

01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,000

Renegade! Pride! Renegade! Pride !

01:08:53,1500 --> 01:08:55,100
When I say renegade you say pride!

01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,500
Renegade! Pride! Renegade! Pride !

01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,500
Renegade, renegade! Pride! Pride! 

01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,900
Renegade, renegade! Pride! Pride! 

01:09:00,00 --> 01:09:02,400
You got that renegade pride!  

01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,900
Yes!

01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,500
No you can't take nothing away from my boy.

01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,500
No you can't put a shadow on his side. 

01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,600
Oh, that's right! A barrel of laughs! 

01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:57,300
Barrel of monkeys!

01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,400
Yeah, well my boys might get awful proud tonight! 

01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,000
So awful god damn happy! 

01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,900
You’re dinner’s on me ! 

01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,500
Get out here, when you're ready! 

01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,900
Good game fellas. 

01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,000
Hey. Tracy, 

01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,500
good war cuz. 

01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,900
You know, you should stay here tonight. 

01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Tell us your tales of living among the of- of living among the napequans. 

01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Don’t…

01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,500
Don't make me drive home alone with him. 

01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,500
Why? Afraid he might try to get lucky! 

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh, very funny, fuck you. 

01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,000
No. 

01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,9500
It's just…he's different, when you're alone with him.

01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,200
He’s just like uh uh…

01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,100
He's so vulnerable and stuff. 

01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,500
I just don't really feel like hearing his life story again, okay? 

01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,000
All right. 

01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,600
Thanks, Waylin, no I can’t do it. 

01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:05,000
I gotta chauffeur that old, funny boy on home. 

01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,500
Weiner boy, you mean. 

01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,500
Yeah. 

01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,200
Weiner, boy? Why-why you guys call him that, huh? 

01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,000
Uh…

01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,500
We caught him lookin' at our wieners. 

01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,100
Let's go! 

01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,900
Get in. 

01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,300
Get your ass in gear, let's go. 

01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,600
It's a long ride home, Gid. You'll freeze. 

01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,000
Get your ass in gear boy. 

01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,900
It's okay. 

01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,500
It's so embarrassing. 

01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,600
It's not embarrassing. 

01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,200
It's sexy to me.

01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,000
Hold still, okay? 

01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
Hey? 

01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,500
Are you still here? 

01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:54,900
What?

01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,200
I want some pancakes. 

01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,950
What? 

01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Careful. Make sure it's still on. 

01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,000
God, I hate these things. 

01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Can you shut the door, please? 

01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,000
Why?

01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,900
It's really intimate. I don't think I know you that well. 

01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,00
You know me well enough to fuck me, 
but not enough to watch me pee? 

01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,000
Haven't spent much time around women, that's all. 

01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,000
Well, that's for sure. 

01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,900
What is that supposed to mean? 

01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,900
It means I'm frustrated, Roy. 

01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,500
Well, look it, I know I was fast, but we can try.

01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,500
No, Roy, no, I'm not frustrated with sex, okay? 

01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,500
I'm just…

01:4:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I’m just frustrated with boys who think sex isn't intimate. 

01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
And how many boys is that? 

01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,500
You know, Roy, I think I liked you better 
when I thought you were someone else. 

01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,500
Who'd you think I was? 

01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,900
Someone a little older. 

01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Well, I'm working on that, as fast as I can. 

01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,500
You can’t…

01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,900
Don't rush it, Roy. 

01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,500
I mean I would love to see who you grow into,

01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:35,500
but I'm just afraid he's turning into out 
to be someone I'd hate myself for falling for,

01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,400
you know, someone hard, 

01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,500
someone who acts all cocksure. 

01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,200
I don't even know what that means. 

01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,800
What are you saying? 

01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,500
Are you saying that what we just did didn't even feel good? 

01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,100
I felt good, Roy. 

01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,100
It’s just it didn’t…

01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,100
It didn't feel right. 

01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,900
I suppose it felt right with, uh…

01:14:58,950 --> 01:14:59,900
what's his bucket? 

01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,400
Zander.

01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,500
And yes, 

01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,700
yes it did. 

01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,500
It must of. 

01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,900
I can't take another winter here. 

01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,000
I think you should go.

01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,500
What can I get you, hon? 

01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,500
Double portion de red eye. 

01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,500
Isn't, Skyla supposed to work this shift? 

01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,000
Not this shift or any shift. 

01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,100
What? 

01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,500
Listen kid, what she means is,

01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,000
 she bought a bus ticket from me, 

01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,000
for Seattle, for tomorrow. 

01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,900
Hey Floyd, come on! 

01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Come on. 

01:17:48,900 --> 01:16:49,500
Ha ha sexy ! 

01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,900
Hurry up, Roy! 

01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:08,500
Lem says we can clear 300 bucks easy. 

01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,000
Are you sure we're not gonna get caught?

01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,100
Sure, I'm sure. 

01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,100
Come on, now three at a time weak tit. 

01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,700
Come on, come on, come on, some time today would be good. 

01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,000
Chutney, get your head outta your ass. 

01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,200
Come on, baby. 

01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,500
Come on, bab.  

01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,500
Come on,  girl. You can do it, come on.

01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,500
Yeah.

01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,500
All right. 

01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,500
I'm gonna find you a room at the mission. 

01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,800
You outta straighten things on up.

01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:52,000
“Straighten up and fly right”, Nat King Cole trio, 1949.

01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,500
That's right.

01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,800
Sleep tight. 

01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,050
Ever since we played up in hardview, 

01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,200
I've been thinking and, uh,

01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,500
 it's not worth it. 

01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,950
Tracy,

01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,500
You and I are supposed to be together.

01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,500
Yeah, hey! 

01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,700
You can't just quit on me. 

01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,500
You know quit, leave, what the fuck ever.  

01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,000
The team really needs you. 

01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:17,900
I need you. 

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,500
Look, I've out grown this little six-man scrub league. 

01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,500
What? 

01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,600
Yeah, then there's that whole thing with you and Gid. 

01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,950
What thing? 

01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,500
You know how Gid's always, creaming his shorts over us? 

01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,500
Gid's weird man. 

01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,500
Yeah. 

01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,500
Okay. 

01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,500
But, he's harmless.   He's just all…

01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,500
He’s just all bruised up inside, you know? 

01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,100
Lem says Gid's dangerous. 

01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,500
You know, he got some kid killed up in Hishem. 

01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,200
Lem doesn't know a jack shit about jack shit! 

01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,900
Yeah, he knows about you cozying up in those freight cars with, Gid. 

01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,500
Man, I can explain it now. 

01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,500
I don't even wanna hear it man. 

01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,600
Shut your pie hole!

01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,000
Let's get these god damn, trees outta here! 

01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,950
Like father, like son. 

01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,450
Look, 

01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,490
I told you

01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,200
Lem's not my father. 

01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,000
Least I can trust him, not to bend me 
over some of the fuck ass. 

01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,800
No, but you can trust him to give you 
your nightly smack down. 

01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,800
No wonder you quitting you coward. 

01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,000
You don't know a damn thing about my life! Napequan!	

01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,800
Get up, Roy! 

01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,000
You, kids hold it right there!

01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
God damn snowplow!

01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Damn!

01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,900
Francis? 

01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,500
It's, Roy, ma. 

01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,100
Roy? 

01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,500
You get home, right this minute. 

01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,500
I can't. 

01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,400
You're not going to believe this. 

01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,500
I don't wanna hear about it! 

01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,000
Zumack, well she's gone. 

01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,900
She got out where you jerry-rigged that corral!

01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,400
And Francis, is so mad, he won't- he won't even speak to me! 

01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,500
He-he left. He just… 

01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,600
He just up and left. 

01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,500
My pregnant horse is somewhere up there in that blizzard. 
And…

01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,900
And now god! God damn you Roy Chutney, 

01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
you get on home! 

01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,300
Hi. It’s Skyla, leave me a message.
I'll call you back. 

01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Sky, it’s me, pick up the phone. 

01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,500 
Would you pick up the phone? 

01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Damn it! Sky, I know you're there. 
Would you pick up the phone? 

01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,900
I really need to talk.

01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,600
Go grab your mother. 

01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,100
Taking those trees to Pocatello tonight. 

01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,100
No, fuck that noise. 

01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,800
I'm going to see about, Roy. 

01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,500
You go down there, and they'll throw your stupid ass in jail! 

01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:17,500
And then they'll come after me. 

01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,200
Yeah, I hope to hell they would!

01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,500
Tracy, stop it. 

01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,900
Let him be. 

01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Let him go! 

01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,600
Tracy, Tracy please baby! 

01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Lem! Lemmy. 

01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,190
What,

01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Lemmy ?

01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Just go! 

01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,600
Are you his father or his guardian? 

01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:07,200
I ain’t exactly his mother.

01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:10,200
Uh, he's my coach, madam. 

01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,700
Open.

01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Thank you, Gid. 

01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,900
I'll pay you back, I promise. 

01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:25,800
Okay Roy. 

01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,900
Me and Floyd were hoping to…

01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:33,300
go up to Georgetown lake.
Catch us some fish before the game. 

01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:34,600
You’ll drive us up there?

01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:36,600
We'll call things even-steven. 

01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,800
Sure. 

01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,800
Yeah? 

01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,000
Yeah. It's a deal. 

01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,500
Hey, Floyd! 

01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,700
Hey. 

01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,750
Floyd! 

01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,900
You monkey, wake up. 

01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,700
We got us a fishing partner!  

01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,000
Sleeping beauty, wake up! 

01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,600
Come on, Floyd, wake up! 

01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,000
Floyd, gee. 

01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,300
Go get us a hot meal. 

01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,100
Hey! 

01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,600
Gid! 

01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,800
What? 

01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:04,700
I don't think he is…

01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:05,990
Oh, no, no, no, look out, look out, look out. 

01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Floyd come on! 

01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Come on!

01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,300
Is he breathing? 

01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,800
Okay, I got him. 

01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,500
Is he breathing? 

01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,600
Oh, just breathe. 

01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,900
Oh, Floyd. 

01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,600
Oh, Floyd. 

01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,600
Stupid.  

01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,000
Oh, Floyd don't go. 

01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:07,790
Good morning, Saint Regis, Cordinlaine, Kellogg, 
Spokane, Walla Walla.

01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,850
All points west. 

01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,900
Let’s go.

01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,600
All points west. This for both of you?

01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:12,600
Yep. 

01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:13,600
Yeah, okay. 

01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,600
All points west, huh? 

01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
Sounds optimistic. 

01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,950
Going anywhere in particular, or you just going? 

01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,000
Island, it's supposed to be beautiful. 

01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,200
You're not okay, are you? 

01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,000
Just lie to me ‘cause I…

01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,600
Tell me you're not going far.

01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,300
Tell me you're gonna come back. 

01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,600
I did lie to you. 

01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,900
In a way, I guess. 

01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,400
I was home last night, when you called me.

01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,500
I’m sorry. I'm…

01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:13,000
not much help to you, am I? 

01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,900
You're such a help, that I want. 

01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,100
I'm gonna go. 

01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,500
I know. 

01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,500
Mom are you alone? 

01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,600
Mom are you okay?

01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,500
Oh Floyd! 

01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,900
That’s what Floyd… He

01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,500
He caught a 11 pound squaw fish out here. 

01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,200
I'm hardly strong enough to reel her in. 

01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,500
Christ, he was so happy. 

01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,200
Didn’t have the heart to tell him squaw fish is trash fish. 

01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,900
No, it's no good for eating. 

01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,500
Oh, it’s all…

01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,900
All grease and bones, that's all.  

01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,800
Are you a wayfaring, Floyd? 

01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,000
Oh, yeah, Gid. 

01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:08,900
“Wayfaring pilgrim”, Almeda Riddle, 1932. 

01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,800
Are you drifting, Floyd? 

01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Not “drifting too far from the shore” [Bill Monroe]. 

01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,100
Where are you going? 

01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:25,000
“I’m going back to Jericho” [Doc Watson and Clarence Ashley]. 

01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Thank you. 

01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Hehere. 

01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,900 
Hey why don't you have some of this. 

01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,950
No. 

01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Come on, come on, come on. 

01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Roy, you still don't trust me son. 

01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,900
After all of everything. 

01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I think it's time you told me about, Hishem. 

01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,100
Hishem? 

01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,100
Yep. 

01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,500
The boy in the picture on your wall. 

01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,800
What happened to him? 

01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:25,800
Oh, Roy, he's just…

01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,500
He’s just some scrawny, toe-headed

01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,500
kid. 

01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,000
Come on. Look at this. 

01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,200
Tackle packed.  We got a big game. 

01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,900
Gid, Gid!

01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,000
Don't lie to me. 

01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,800
All right. 

01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,500
His name's Jody. 

01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
He was a real sweet fullback. 

01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah, he looked me straight in the eye, 

01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,000
just like you.

01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,300
He had wide shoulders 

01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,100
and softest hands. 

01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,100
I ain't ever known

01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:12,000
natural grace myself with that boy

01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,100 
Well, he'd catch that ball 

01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,100
with half the field. 

01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,100
We had a team picnic, 

01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,600
up on, uh, Kicking Horse lake. 

01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:33,600
And maybe on this old boat.

01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,500 
Way out there. 

01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,000
That’s it

01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,400
And this shittin' boat, 

01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,700
it sunk. 

01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,000
It just sunk. 

01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,900
My rough boy 

01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,400
My boy, 

01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
My beautiful boy

01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,700 
he, 

01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,700
 he kept hold of the boat. 

01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,500
He went

01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,800
 down with it. 

01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,900
Yeah, reached down after him. 

01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,100
I should have kept going. 

01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,800
I should have just died, 

01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:33,900
trying to save that boy. 

01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,000
Then you'd both be dead, Gid. 

01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:38,800
Well.

01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:41,100
It's be better than, uh,

01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,000
living with him gone. 

01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,100
If he hadn't died, he'd still have left ya. 

01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,900
What were you doing with him?

01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,650
What were you doing with him, out there on that boat, Gid ? 

01:34:00,652 --> 01:34:01,690
What was I doing? 

01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,000
We were boating, Roy. 

01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,100
Roy, we were on a damn boat, across the damn lake. 

01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,200
How 'bout that? Is that so bad? 

01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,550
It wasn't so good for Jody, was it? 

01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,500
Don’t you understand? 

01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,900
You remind me of him. 

01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,900
You’re both alive. 

01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,500
Spring water is

01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
something better than 

01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,100
what it moves through. 

01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,500
Well, I'm not him! 

01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,500
And he's not me! 

01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,500
And he should have learned to swim, he should have known that much! 

01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,100
And so should you! 

01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,100
Let's get outta here. 

01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,100
I'm freezing my ass off. 

01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,800
Go! 

01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,500
Set! 

01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,500
Hike!

01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,000
Oh, Roy. 

01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,500
What the hell you thinkin' huh? 

01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,900
Throwin' a widow maker out there, where's you head? 

01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,000
My head's just about ripped off out there. 

01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,500
Without Tracy…

01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:42,500
Well, welcome to the world! 

01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:43,500
Get the hell back out there! 

01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,000
And stop your whining! 

01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:47,500
Stick 'em good, saw 'em off!

01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,100
Hey! You get yours you little, puke!  

01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,055
Come on!

01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:14,000
Let's go! I want it! I want it! 

01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,500
You little punk!

01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,500
Oh, lord. 

01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,700
These poor  

01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,700
pissants. 

01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,500
They ain't so tough. 

01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,500
We gotta break them down.

01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,500
Kill them.

01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,100
They'll slaughter rules us. 

01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,500
In Texas, they’ll that

01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,500
mercy rule. 

01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,500
Same thing, either way. 

01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,500
Yeah, hey !

01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,500
Right! 

01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,000
Let's go with twin sweep, right! 

01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:34,700
GJS

01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,100
Well, call them then. 

01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Pitch after pass. 

01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:40,000
Yeah, but don't give it up too late. 

01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,500
Or, you're one to talk. 

01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:43,200
I'm here ! Ain't I? 

01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,300
Yeah, hey!

01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,000
Yeah, hey!

01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
All right.

01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:49,500
Twin sweep right on one, on one. 

01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:50,500
Ready? 

01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:51,600
Break. 

01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,800
Whoa, all right!

01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,500
Go, Tracy! 

01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,500
Good job, buddy, good job.

01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,000
That's it. That’s it! Don't get hurt, give hurt. 

01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,100
Keep giving Two Dogs the ball. 

01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,500
They won't know what from what!

01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,900
What the hell is Tracy doing, man? 

01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Counting coo. 

01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,600
That’s it. Just break yourself where you are. 

01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,500
All right, big daddy! 

01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,500
Are you okay? 

01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,800
My neck. 

01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,000
Hey! Get an ambulance over here! 

01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,500
Okay, all right, easy bud.

01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,700
Take it easy, all right? 

01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,000
Don’t move, okay ?

01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,500
Get over here! 

01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,500
One, two, three!

01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,100
What they say, Gid? 

01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:06,200
Oh, well they said thatTrace took a bad shot to the neck. 

01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,500
And they said strong kid can survive it. 

01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:11,000
Tracy's strong as they come. 

01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,100
Sure took it like a man. 

01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,000
Oh, it got so god dang, dark.

01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
They a hack away from the slaughter rule, anyways. 

01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,500
How 'bout we just, uh, 

01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:31,100
well we call it a night, huh? 
We just all go on home, and get warm huh? 

01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,100
Hey. 	

01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,000
Those fuckers, took Tracy out on purpose. 

01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:37,000
It wasn't on purpose. It's football. 

01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,500
And so what? We should lay down and die? 

01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,100
No, I don't want anybody else getting hurt. 

01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,900
But we don't get hurt. 

01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,500
We give hurt. 'member? 

01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:50,000
No, not tonight we don't. We ain't go the man power for it. 

01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:50,900
Yes, we do. 

01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:53,950
If we stop playing like children, 
and we start playing like men, we do. 

01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,500
Easy champer, look we did our best. 

01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
There ain't no shame in getting beat. 

01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,900
What ever happened to hit back harder? 

01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:02,900
No, no it doesn't always work that way. 

01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:03,900
Yes, it does, work that way! 

01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,900
Cannon ball, coming at you. 

01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Cannon ball! Cannon ball! Comin’ at you!

01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:09,000
Roy. Roy. 

01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:14,500
You got that Renegade pride? Yes, woo! 

01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:17,800
You got hat renegade pride? Good god, yes! 

01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:18,900
Roy! 

01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
When I say renegade you say pride. 

01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,700
Renegade, pride!  Renegade, pride! 

01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:25,100
When I say renegade,  you say pride. 

01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,500
Come on! 
Get him outta here! 

01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:27,500
Renegade- pride!

01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,400
Roy! 

01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:29,400
You see?

01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,000
It works that way! 

01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,000
Unless you're a coward? 

01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,500
Men know when to walk away. Just quit acting like a punk. 

01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,500
You're the punk, Gid. 

01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,500
I've seen you cry.

01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:48,000
I know what you are. 

01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:49,900
Oh. 

01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,700
What's that you said to Gid? 

01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,500
I said you’re a coward. 

01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,900
Little pussy! 

01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,300
Now, is that what you think of Gid? 

01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:00,000
That's what I think of you. 

01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,900
I bet you was better than that, Roy.

01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,500
I thought, 

01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,000
me and you 

01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,100
had some trust. 

01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:15,100
I can see right through you, Roy.

01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,000
You ain't tough. 

01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,000
I'll show you tough. 

01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:22,500
Everyone knows 

01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,100
that you're a sugar tit! 

01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,100
You see! 

01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,800
There's bastards enough in this world, Roy. 

01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,960
Bastards

01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,800
and they'll shit all over a mama's boy like you. 

01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:33,000
You gotta show 'em Roy!

01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,800
Gid! 

01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:36,300
I trusted you. I trusted you, Roy! 

01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:38,500
Show me you have the balls to get fucked in this life.

01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:39,800
Show me, Roy! 

01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,400
That's it. 

01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,600
That's it, Roy. 

01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,300
Help me up. 

01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,800
Oh, it's okay. 

01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:01,500
It's okay, oh I'm sorry. 

01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,600
You are sorry. 

01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,000
You're a sorry-ass queer. 

01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,150
Roy. 

01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,900
And I'm sick of it. 

01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:11,700
Roy

01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:12,700
Did you hear that? 

01:43:12,701 --> 01:43:13,290
Roy. 

01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,500
He's a sorry-ass queer!  And I'm sick of his 
 
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,000
bullshit! 

01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:18,700
Roy, don't quit on me. 

01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,090
Roy

01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,100
don't leave me out here all alone. 

01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,900
Fuckin' pathetic! 

01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,500
Don't leave me alone. 

01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:26,900
Roy.

01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Don't leave me here. 

01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Roy. 

01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:32,500
Roy. 

01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,300
Roy. 

01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,400
Don’t!

01:43:38,401 --> 01:43:38,980
What?

01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:39,900
Fuckin' touch me. 

01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,500
I won't touch you. I won't touch ya. 

01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:44,600
No, I won't hurt ya. 
 
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,100
Gid ain't never hurt nobody, okay? 

01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,100
This

01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,550
Roy

01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,600
This ain't you. 

01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:52,600
You ain't hard.

01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,700
Roy. 

01:43:56,00 --> 01:43:57,100
I'm hard enough!

01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,000
Roy. I…

01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,900
I know you're joshing old Gid, huh? 

01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,100
You see, I'm laughing.

01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,500
Roy, I'm laughing. 

01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:07,000
You see this. I'm laughing. 

01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,500
I thought we had us a deal, Roy! 

01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,500
Roy!

01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:14,500
I thought we had a deal! 

01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:02,400
I'm sorry. 

01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,800
<b> My dad used to call me his little king. </b>

01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,100
<b> Dad wasn't trying to leave, was he? </b>

01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,500
<b> He wasn't trying to hop that freight. </b>

01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,500
<b> No. </b>

01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000

01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,200
<b> Would he? </b>

01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,500
Gid! 

01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,0000
Gid! 

01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:23,800
<b> Everything breaks down. </b>

01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:24,900
Gid!

<b> Everything gets against to me. </b>

Gid.

Gid.

01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,600
Gid. 

01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:33,900

01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:47,600
Come on!

01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,500
Gid?

01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,500
Is that you, Studebaker?

01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:10,500
No, no, no.

01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:11,400
It’s me.

01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,100
Roy.

01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,500
My old buddy.

01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:20,000
You came back for old, Gid. 

01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,900
But why? 

01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,500
Why? 

01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:31,500
I know. 

01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:34,500
I know, I did. 

01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,500
Come on. 

01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,500
Okay. 

01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,500
Here we go. 

01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,500
Here we go. 

01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,200
That's it. 

01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,500
That's it. 

01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Yeah, hey?

Yeah, hey!

01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,500
My boy.
