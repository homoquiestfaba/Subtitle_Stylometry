24
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,556
Lives about four or five miles
out on Derrick Road

25
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,286
past the old Branch place.

26
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,725
- Oh, l know the old
Branch place.

27
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,092
She a hustlin` lady, Bob?

28
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,426
- Well, l guess so,

29
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,830
but she`s-she`s been
pretty decent about it.

30
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,663
She ain`t taken on
no roustabouts

31
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:02,668
or nothin` like that.

32
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,226
ln fact,

33
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,501
if these preachers around town
weren`t rompin` down on me,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,007
l wouldn`t bother her at all.

35
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,099
- Well, how shall l handle it?

36
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:10,939
Tell her to lay off
awhile or...

37
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,638
- Oh, l don`t know.
l don`t know.

38
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,978
Just go out and size her up
and make your own decision.

39
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,540
l know you`ll be gentle,

40
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,848
as gentle and pleasant
as you can be.

41
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,945
So go on out there,
see how she looks to ya.

42
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,252
- All right.

43
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,657
Thanks, Bob.

44
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,472
Mornin` Miss Parker.

45
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:49,448
- Oh, hello.
- Mornin`, ma`am.

46
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,451
The troubIe with growing up
in a smaII town

47
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,817
is everybody thinks
they know who you are.

48
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,594
I was born here 29 years ago.

49
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,119
And CentraI City
was smaII enough

50
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:08,624
that my father
was the onIy doctor in town.

51
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:09,794
Then the oiI boom came,

52
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:13,704
and the town grew
to fit its name.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,674
The sheriff`s office handIes
the poIicing

54
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,370
for both the city
and the county.

55
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,244
We do a pretty good job of it,
to our own way of thinkin`.

56
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,943
We`re kind of oId-fashioned.

57
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,952
Out here, you say,
``Yes, ma`am, `` and ``No, ma`am, ``

58
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,853
to anything with a skirt on.

59
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,789
Out here, if you catch a man
with his pants down,

60
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,189
you apoIogize,

61
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:34,887
even if you have to arrest him
afterwards.

62
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,124
Out here, you`re a man
and a gentIeman,

63
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,293
or you aren`t anything at aII.

64
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,428
And God heIp you
if you`re not.

65
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,310
[knocking]

66
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,287
- Yes?

67
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,387
- l`m sorry, ma`am, uh...

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,227
- Oome on in.

69
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,759
You go on back.

70
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,795
l just need to wash up.

71
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:41,392
What do you think
you`re doing with that?

72
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,521
- Sheriff`s office, ma`am.

73
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,621
What are you doing with it?

74
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,791
- l have a permit.

75
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,138
Are you satisfied, copper?

76
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,773
- Well, l reckon it`s all right.

77
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,842
And my name`s Ford, ma`am,
not Oopper.

78
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,046
- Jesus.

79
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,556
The only decent-looking guy
l`ve seen in this stink hole

80
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,184
and he`s a boy scout
with a badge.

81
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,659
How much?

82
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:15,820
l don`t jazz cops.

83
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,921
- That`s not very polite, ma`am.

84
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,898
l just came out here
for a little talk.

85
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,594
- And l asked you
what you wanted.

86
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:25,469
- Well, l guess l want you
out of Oentral Oity by sundown.

87
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:28,440
And if l see you
here after that...

88
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,965
l`m gonna run you in
for prostitution.

89
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,170
- You lousy son of a bitch.

90
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,202
- Don`t you call me that, ma`am.

91
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:38,847
- You lousy son of a bitch!

92
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:42,753
You son of a bitch,
bastard, pimp!

93
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,260
Get off me!

94
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,461
Get off me!

95
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,903
Let go of me, you bastard!

96
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:06,039
Get off me!

97
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,639
You bastard son of a bitch!

98
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,715
[crying]

99
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,521
- l`m sorry.

100
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:54,084
- l`m sorry.
- no.

101
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,119
Don`t say you`re sorry.

102
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,141
- % I`m a tip-top daddy %

103
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,448
% And I`m gonna have my way %

104
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,921
% Keep away from the corners %

105
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,218
% Hear what I got to say %

106
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,485
% HoId one hand onIy %

107
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,924
% Get ready for a ride %

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,021
- % Give me one hand loose
and l`ll be satisfied %

109
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,430
I went back the next day
and the day after that.

110
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,956
I couIdn`t heIp it.

111
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,128
It was Iike a wind had been
turned on a dying fire.

112
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,603
- % Give me free hand, woman %

113
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,230
% Let it swing by my side %

114
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:43,538
% Give me one hand Ioose
and I`II be satisfied %

115
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:52,642
% %

116
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:12,061
% Satisfied %

117
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:19,472
- Let`s pull out of this
crummy old town together,

118
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,037
just you and me.

119
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,571
- What, are you crazy?

120
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:28,352
- Go on.

121
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,151
Let me hear you say it.

122
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,714
- Oh, no.

123
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:33,521
- Go on.

124
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,552
Tell me what a fine ol` family
y`all Fords is.

125
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:38,564
``We all Fords, ma`am.

126
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:40,463
``We wouldn`t even think of
living with one of you

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,694
miserable ol` whores, ma`am.``

128
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,964
- Don`t.

129
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,062
- You think
you`re too good for me.

130
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,629
- Don`t start that.

131
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,040
- You do.

132
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,601
l`ll never give you up.

133
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,772
never.

134
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,475
And if you think
you`re too good for me now,

135
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,040
l`ll make it so you won`t be.

136
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:03,249
- Oh, baby, you got your bowels
in an uproar all over nothin`.

137
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,223
l was just thinkin`
about the money.

138
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,725
- l can get money.

139
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,226
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:13,289
- He`s crazy about me,
and he`s dumb as hell.

141
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,561
- l`m sorry?

142
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:18,002
Who`s crazy about you
and dumb as hell?

143
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:21,473
- Elmer Oonway.

144
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:23,975
You know who he is, don`t ya?

145
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,240
- I knew EImer Conway
weII enough.

146
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,749
We`d been in the same cIass
together at schooI.

147
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,546
Aw, he wasn`t a bad man.

148
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,553
He`d just been spoiIed.

149
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,715
SpoiIed by his father,
Chester Conway.

150
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,021
Chester had buiIt
haIf of CentraI City,

151
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,617
and he acted Iike
he owned the town,

152
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:45,722
and nobody had the guts
to teII him any different.

153
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,630
Joyce was a fooI to think
she couId put one over

154
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,760
on oId man Conway.

155
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:51,497
But her pIan started me
thinking about

156
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,097
how I couId settIe
some oId scores of my own.

157
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,341
- You want a refill, hon?

158
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,472
- no, l`ve got to go.

159
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,503
- All right.

160
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,778
So you`re a deputy sheriff?

161
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:07,979
You don`t even carry a gun.

162
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,080
- no, l don`t.

163
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,784
- What if some crook
should try to shoot ya?

164
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:15,988
- Well, l`ll tell you a secret.

165
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,395
We don`t have too many crooks
in Oentral Oity.

166
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:20,661
- That`s good to know.

167
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,600
- I started needIing peopIe.

168
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,159
I couIdn`t heIp it.

169
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,933
I guess it was a substitute
for somethin` eIse.

170
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,873
Thank you, Max.
- You don`t have to pay.

171
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:31,376
l want to thank you for what
you`ve done for my Johnnie.

172
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,572
no one else would`ve done
what you did.

173
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:34,841
- Thank you very much, Max.

174
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:35,973
l appreciate that.

175
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,915
- lt`s made a big difference.

176
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,112
- You know, l figure that you
don`t get any more out of life

Your father adopted him.

Dad thought that Mike would be
good company for me.

232
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:05,928

brings in another son.

He was working on a girder
on a Oonway Oonstruction job.

255
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:02,082
Apparently he slipped
on a rivet.

256
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,315
So when he fell...

257
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,551
he threw himself backwards...

258
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:10,051
so he`d land inside the building
and onto the decking.

259
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,361
But the floors, they hadn`t been
decked in properly.

260
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,368

this deal through properly.

to go non-union,

00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,686
that Elmer bring that money out
all by himself.

353
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,519
now, those are her terms,
and l-

354
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:41,924
- l don`t see what
she`s got to do with it.

355
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:42,928
- Well, what you don`t see

356
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,953
is that you have
a whole lot of gall.

357
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:45,986
- What`d you say?

358
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,430
- Well, how do you think
it would look

359
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,492
if it got around
that an officer of the law

360
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,164
had made a blackmail payoff?

361
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,729
now, Elmer came to me
with his trouble,

362
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:55,740
and l came to you,

363
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,173
and you asked me to see
what l could do

364
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:58,574
about gettin` this done
quietly,

365
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,772
and l`ve done all
that l can think to do,

366
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,748
and l don`t see how you can
ask me to do one thing more.

367
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,520
- Maybe you`re right, boy.

368
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,150
But you will see that she leaves
after she gets that money.

369
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,092
- lf she isn`t gone
after an hour,

370
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,062
l`ll move her on myself.

371
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,429
- Well, l`m gonna send Elmer
over to your place

372
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,957
as soon as l can locate him.

373
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:26,369
And you make sure
he`s got everything straight.

374
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,600
Understand?

375
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:35,110
- What if the old man
never cools off, hmm?

376
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,671
- Well, hold on, you told me
you were sure

377
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,012
he was gonna come around.

378
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,041
lf that isn`t the case,
l better tell Miss Lakeland.

379
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,178
- no. Don`t you do that, Lou.

380
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,381
- Why don`t you do this?

381
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:44,616
Why don`t you buy a business?

382
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,147
Then you and Joyce
can run it together,

383
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:47,385
and when it gets goin` good,

384
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,589
then you get in touch
with your old man and...

385
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,119
he`ll see you made
a darned smart move.

386
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:54,394
- [chuckles]

387
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,767
Yeah, l don`t know about that.

388
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,169
- Well l`m not gonna
twist your arm.

389
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:02,002
l already stuck my neck out
about a mile and a half

390
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,531
to give you all a fresh start.

391
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:04,600
- l know you did, but why?

392
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:05,837
Why?

393
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:09,143
Why`d you do all this
for me and her, Lou?

394
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,878
- l might`ve thought that you`d
do something for me.

395
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:14,909
- Oh.

396
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,080
Well, hey, l can give you

397
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,816
a little out of that $1 0,000,
l guess.

398
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,050
- Oh, don`t bother.

399
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,581
lf you don`t have any money
of your own,

400
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,821
l don`t want to take
your old man`s.

401
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:25,227
- l got plenty of my own money.

402
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:27,391
Oome on.

403
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,161
Oh, hell, here.

404
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,501
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,938
- l appreciate it.
Thank you, Elmer.

406
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:37,204
- l appreciate it.

407
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:38,766
So you`re gonna be there
tonight, right?

408
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,745
- 1 0:00.
- 1 0:00.

409
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,610
- Hey, have you heard
this stuff?

410
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,411
Black.

What are you doin` here?

429
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:39,063
- Ohester wanted me to come by
and hold Elmer`s hand.

430
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:41,498
- [laughs]

431
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,797
Well, he won`t be here
for another hour, so...

[panting]

433
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,647
- You will join me in two weeks,
won`t you, Lou?

434
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:34,376
Won`t you?

435
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:39,946
- Well,
that`s my understanding.

436
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,153
- You promise?

437
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:01,608
Lou, do you suppose Elmer will,
you know,

438
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:04,207
make any trouble?

439
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,240
- l don`t see how he can.

440
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,715
What`s he gonna do,
squawk to his dad?

441
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:16,057
l`ll just tell him
you changed your mind.

442
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,959
- l don`t know, it just-

443
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:20,556
lt all seems
so complicated.

444
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:25,466
- Well...

445
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,031
l`ll tell ya, honey,
it is kind of complicated.

446
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:32,168
You remember my stepbrother,
the one who died?

447
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:33,178
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:36,943
- Well, Ohester Oonway...

449
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:39,917
organized it
for him to be killed.

450
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,113
- That`s terrible, Lou.

451
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:43,246
- Yeah.

452
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:47,054
- You can`t do anything
to Elmer.

453
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,925
You mustn`t, honey.

454
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,896
Please?
l won`t let you.

455
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:59,833
They won`t catch me, baby.

456
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:01,806
They won`t even suspect me
for it, really.

457
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,172
They`ll just think
he got tanked,

458
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,973
like he usually is,

459
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:11,244
and then you two
got to fighting,

460
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:14,275
and you both got killed.

461
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,311
- Well, that doesn`t
make any sense.

462
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:20,052
How am l supposed to be dead?

463
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:26,891
- Don`t.

00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:29,628
l have to travel.

465
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,669

goin` anywhere.

lt`s almost over.

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,795
Why?

- Hey, Lou, ol` boy.

489
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,502
You got here before me, huh?

490
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,871
- You bring the money?

491
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:24,273
- What`s it look like?

492
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:25,833
Where`s Joyce?

493
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:27,276
- Oh, she`s in the bedroom.

494
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:29,212
Why don`t you go on back?

495
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,738
Bet she`s all stretched out
and waitin` for ya.

496
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:34,843
- Oh, now you shouldn`t
talk like that.

497
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:36,148

to be married.

Oh, God.

503
00:29:50,702 --> 00:29:52,795
Who did it, Lou?

504
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:53,964
- lt was suicide.

505
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,768
- That doesn`t make any sense.

506
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:56,831
- Oh, sure it does.

507
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,137

You seemed awful surprised,

Oh, shoot.

- Well, l`m real sorry, sir.

and then l didn`t see you
when l-

520
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,315
- Oome on, let`s go.

521

We don`t have time
to stand around gabbin`.

522

- Well, it`s still pretty early.

523
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,689
- The hell it is.

524
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,851
lt`s quarter past 1 1 :00,
and Elmer ain`t home yet.

525
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,417
He said he was gonna come back
right away,

526
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:25,019
and he ain`t done it.

527
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:26,325
Oome on, you follow me.

528
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:00,992
Yeah, but don`t tell me
that again.

529
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:04,263

530
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:07,465
He`s dead,
and that is that.

531
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,167
What l`m interested in now
is her.

532
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,197
Well, do it.

533
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:14,144
Get on out here
as quick as you can.

534
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,637
l don`t want to see her die,
not this way.

535
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,843
l want to see her burn.

536
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,187
Just get that ambulance
out here now.

537
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,664
- So, Lou, that`s, uh...

538
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,362
That`s it?

539
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,802
That`s all you got to say?

540
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:43,399
- Well, l told it five times.

541
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:46,410
l guess the only thing
l left out of it all...

542
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,071
l feel awful sorry.

543
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:49,444
- Well it`s a bit late
for that.

544
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,472
- Tried to handle this
blackmail deal all by myself.

545
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:55,008
You know, l sure wish
l`d come to you, Bob, with it.

546
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:56,384
- lt`s okay, Lou.
- l really do.

547
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,389
l would have, had it been
anybody other than Ohester

548
00:32:58,423 --> 00:32:59,549
asking for help.

549
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:00,819
You know that.
- lt`s all right.

550
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,986
Don`t fret yourself about that.

551
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,519
- Well, l appreciate
your understanding.

552
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,796
- Well, get some sleep, partner.

553
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,238
Good night.

554
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,139
- Good night, boss.

555
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,906
[horn honks]

556
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:35,790
- Here`s your food.

557
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:36,953
- Thank you, Max.

558
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:40,260
- Hey, Lou,
l need to ask you something.

559
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:42,493
lt`s about Johnnie.

560
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,968
He`s taken a job
at Slim Murphy`s and, uh...

561
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:47,597
Well, l hear bad things
about Slim Murphy.

562
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,107
So l was wondering-

563
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:51,540
- Would you like me
to check up on him?

564
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:52,600
- Yeah, could you?

565
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:54,703
- l`d be happy to.

566
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:55,770
- Thank you.

567
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:58,374
Appreciate it.

568
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:02,515
- I was gIad to do Max
a good turn.

569
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:04,112
I knew Amy`d be waiting for me,

570
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:06,715
and I knew
she`d be mad as heII.

571
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,727
Fathers are funny.

572
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,926
They got ideas of their own.

573
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,094
And the good ones
get in your hair the most.

574
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:21,105
- Dad thinks he knows best
about everything.

575
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,108
- Slim Murphy hasn`t got
a very good reputation.

576
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:25,871
now, nobody`s proved
that he`s been mixed up

577
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,777
in any of these car stripping
jobs, but if l were you-

578
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:30,576
- Yeah, l know, l know.

579
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,846
l won`t get in any trouble, Lou.

580
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:38,685
- That sounds like a promise.

581
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:41,214
l know you won`t break
a promise.

582
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:47,925
- Where have you been?
- l`m sorry, baby.

583
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,263
- Where have you been?
- l`m sorry.

584
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,699
l had a whole lot
of trouble tonight.

585
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,032
- l`ll bet.

586
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,300
- Well, you want to hear about
it or don`t ya?

587
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,500
- l`ve heard so many
of your lies and excuses,

588
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,133
l may as well hear one more.

589
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,837
- All right.

590
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:05,748
Well, it started about
three months ago.

591
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:07,843
Bob asked me to check up
on a prostitute.

592
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:11,452
- Yes?

593
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:14,458

595
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:22,126
- How could you be so stupid?

596
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,464
Why did you do that?

597
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,731
- Well, l was doing a favor
for Ohester Oonway.

598
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,601
He wanted me to help Elmer
get out of a fix.

599
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,005
- Why are you always have to do
people favors?

600
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,269
You never do any for me.

601
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,606
- All right, l shouldn`t have
done it.

602
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:34,441
- You shouldn`t have let
that woman in this town

603
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,446
in the first place.

604
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,971
- no, l shouldn`t have.
- Mm-mm.

605
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:39,347
l don`t understand.

606
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:40,783
- Hey.

607
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:43,287
- Lou.

608
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,084
Stop that.

609
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,693
Lou, stop that.

610
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,850
What`s the matter, huh?

611
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,720
- All this trouble`s
just thrown me for a loop.

612
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:21,486
- Forget everything but me.

613
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:23,391
- l want to.

614
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,555
- Let me pet you.

615
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,776
- You son of a bitch!

616
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:41,779
- Hey, what-

617
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:43,940
- You dirty, filthy bastard!

618
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:44,971
You`re dirty.

619
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,210
l can tell,
l can smell it on you.

620
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,912
l can smell
you`ve been screwing her.

621
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:48,919
- What are you saying?

622
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:49,920
- You screwed her.

623
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:51,114
You`ve been doing it all along.

624
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:52,122
- Oome here.

625
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:53,885
- You don`t touch me!

00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,051
- Amy, listen.
- no.

627
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:56,253

- Amy, look at me.

628
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:57,761
Look at me.
lt`s Lou, honey.

629
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:00,093
The same Lou you`ve known
all your life.

630
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,122
Oome on, open up.

631
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:04,790
Are you crazy?

632
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:08,363
Why would l do that?

633
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:10,772
- You did do it.

634
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:11,775
l know you did.

635
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,504
- Amy, why?

636
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,410
- Stop.

637
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,778
- Why would l run the risk
of losing a girl like you

638
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,510
by running around
with some chippy?

639

- Oh.

640
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:22,848
no use arguing about it.

00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,393
now, you can say what you want
about me,

647
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:37,333
but don`t say that the girl
l`m gonna marry

648
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:41,236
is sleeping with a guy who would
run around with whores.

649
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:42,534
- You don`t want to marry me.

650
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,939
- Yes, l do.

651
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,000
l just didn`t
want to be told when.

652
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,711
l wanted to propose myself...

653
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,741
which is what l`m doing
right now.

- Hey, Lou, it`s Bob.

657
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:07,253
- Bob, what`s on your mind?

00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,556
[horn honks]

659
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:16,230
- Hiya, Lou.

660
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,502
Sorry to bother you.

661
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,840
l hope we didn`t
interrupt anything.

662
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:25,414
- You had a date for last night?

663
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,042
- That`s right.

664
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,576
- For what time?

665
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,146
- Well, supposed to be
a little after 1 0:00,

666
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,316
the time l figured

667
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:35,019
l`d be finished
with the Oonway business.

668
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:38,456
- Who`s the girl?

669
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:39,690
- Well, damn it.

670
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,528
now, that l don`t think
is any of your business.

671
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:45,935
- Howard, you know, you`re kind
of a newcomer out this way,

672
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,904
but you ought to know better
than to ask a man

673
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,804
a question like that.

674
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,433
- lt`s my job.

675
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,968
lf Ford had himself a date
last night, then, uh...

676
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:58,574
Well, you know what l mean,
Ford.

677
00:38:58,616 --> 00:38:59,878
- Well, no offense, Howard,

678
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,714
but l figured you did
all the jawing you had to do

679
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:03,243
when l talked
to you a couple hours ago.

680
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:04,254
- You`re wrong, brother.

681
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:05,846
- Okay, easy, Howard.

She`s one of the nicest
little ladies in town.

686
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:15,555
l ain`t got the slightest doubt
that Lou had a date with her.

687
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,862
- The more
l`m around you people,

688
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,096
the less l understand you.

689

692
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,696
See that track there, Ford?

693
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,130
You know what caused that?

694
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,656
- l reckon so.

695
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:50,668
A flat tire.

696
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,135
- So you admit that.

697
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,764
That`s the sort of track
you`d get from a flat tire.

698
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:55,898
- What`s this all about, Bob?

699
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,669
- You know, l really don`t know,

700
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:58,971
but this is Howard`s show,

701
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,637
so you might as well
just answer him.

702
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:02,578
- Well, l already said it once.

703
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,911
You get that track
from a flat tire, yes, sir.

704
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,446
- Oome see the track
your tire made.

705
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,086
Here we are.

706
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:19,222
The tire that made this track
wasn`t flat.

707
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:20,628
- Well, l never said
l had a flat tire

708
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,962
when l pulled off the highway.

709
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,899
- now, wait a minute.
- no, l had a puncture, sure.

710
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,267
Felt the car sway a little,
but l pulled off the lane

711
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,738
before the tire
could really go down.

712
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:35,608
l hope you boys didn`t chew up a
perfectly good tire for nothin`.

713
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:41,777
- Doggone it, Howard,

714
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,185
if this ain`t
the strangest damn deal.

715
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,261
- Getting away
with a stupid mistake

716
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:55,094
can be a bIessing twice over.

717
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,930
When a man`s rope
sIides off you once,

718
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,436
he`s mighty cautious
about making a second throw.

719
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,563
- Feeling twitchy, Lou?

720
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,367
- Oh, it`s just-

721
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,570
just a passing hunger.

722
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:11,673
- Yeah, l wouldn`t mind
grabbing a bite myself.

723
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:14,981
- Joyce was bound to die
if she wasn`t dead aIready.

724
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,249
As soon as things quieted down,
I`d quit my job.

725
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:18,619
I`d seII the house.

726
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,250
I`d Ieave CentraI City
once and for aII.

727
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,283
- Ooh, those look good.

728
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,589
- She still unconscious?

729
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:27,825
- Yeah.

730
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:30,834
Thank you.

731
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,892
- And anything else for you?

732
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:32,960
- no, l`m good, thank you.

733
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:36,371
- Enjoy your food.

734
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:40,070
- Oonway wants to fly her
to Fort Worth.

735
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:42,978
Says she can`t get the right
kind of medical attention here.

736
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,207
- Yeah, well,
maybe l`ll go myself.

737
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,478
What do you think, Lou?

738
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:50,248
Want to take a little flight
into Fort Worth?

739
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:51,721
- l`ve never been
on an airplane.

740
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:53,087
- Wait a minute.

741
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,150
She hasn`t even been booked yet,
let alone arraigned.

742
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:00,993
- Well, Oonway wasn`t asking you

743
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,522
if he could take her
to Fort Worth.

744
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,933
He was telling ya.

745
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,427
Did he say what time?

746
00:42:08,472 --> 00:42:11,464
- 1 2:30.

747
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,670
- Oh, well, that`ll give Lou
and me time

748
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:15,303
to scrub up a little
and pack a bag.

749
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,610
Right, Lou?

750
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,673
- Yeah.

751
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,685
- What`s the matter
with those eggs, boy?

752
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,210
Better eat `em
before they get cold.

753
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,324
- Don`t.

754
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:28,620
I have to traveI.

755
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,024
- Baby, you aren`t
goin` anywhere.

756
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:31,358
- I want to see her burn.

757
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:36,763
[Bob laughs]

758
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,325
- First time on a plane,

759
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,735
and you waste the whole
damn trip sleepin`.

760
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,113
- Take it easy.

761
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,458
Sheriff.
- Yes, sir?

762
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,396
- You go with the ambulance.

763
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:09,626
Lou, come on.

764
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,692
You ride in the car with me.

765
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:14,998
- All right.

766
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:21,976
- You didn`t like that, did ya?

767
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:24,880
The way l spoke
to ol` Bob Maples.

768
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,510
But l have a reputation,
and l`m not about to

769
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:31,954
let anybody`s tender feelings
get in my way.

770
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:33,422
lf she pulls through
this operation,

771
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:36,051
she`s gonna be able
to talk tonight.

772
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:37,185
l want you to be there

773
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:38,718
when she comes out
of that anesthetic.

774
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:39,923
- What about Bob?

775
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:43,127
- Bob Maples is too old
to be on his toes.

776
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,265
You can use my hotel suite.

777
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,900
You just come over
when l give you a call.

778
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,674
Let`s go to the hospital.

779
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:09,219
- Conway thought
he was a big shot.

780
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,887
But his son
had just been kiIIed

781
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:13,590
by a whore
he`d faIIen in Iove with,

782
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:15,758
and he`d never be abIe
to Iive it down,

783
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,665
not if he Iived to be 100,

784
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:20,603
and I damned weII
hoped he wouId.

785
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:25,899
It was the first time
I`d been out of West Texas,

786
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:29,003
and I wanted to see the sights.

787
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:32,209
Instead, I had to stay
cooped up in the hoteI.

788
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:37,743
It was aImost Iike
there was a pIot against me.

789
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:40,313
I had done something wrong
when I was a kid,

790
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:43,350
and I`d had my nose rubbed
in it day after day

791
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,918
untiI Iike an overtrained dog,

792
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:47,430
I started crapping
out of pure fright.

793
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:51,902
- Hey there, Lou.

794
00:44:51,936 --> 00:44:54,370
- Hey, Bob.

795
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,464
- Quite a palace.

796
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,403
- You know, Bob, l want you
to know that l`m awful sorry

797
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:04,243
about what happened out there
at the airport.

798
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:09,174
l didn`t like it one bit,
and l-l told Oonway that too.

799
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,852
Did you have some kind
of trouble out at the hospital?

800
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:21,660
- She`s dead, Lou.

801
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:28,232
She never came out of the ether.

802
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:41,450
- Well, that`s that.

803
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:44,818
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:19,990
- Hey, Lou.

805
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,992
Where are ya, buddy?

806
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:23,323
Lou.

807
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,452
What you doin`?

808
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:26,759
What you doin` sitting here?

809
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:29,197
- Oh, l`m just having a smoke.

810
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,791
- [chuckles]

811
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:32,803
Well, you can smoke out here.

812
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:33,826
Oome on.

813
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:36,032
Free booze.

814
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:39,868
l know what you are, Lou.

815
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,468
l know what you are.

817
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:44,408
l know.

818
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:48,942
l know you
backwards and forwards.

819
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:51,819
l knowed you since you was
knee-high to a grasshopper,

820
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:54,154
and you ain`t
never done anything wrong.

821
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,394
Maybe l`m behind the times.

822
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:00,693
Maybe...

823
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,323
Maybe l`m too old for this game.

824
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,000
- Why don`t you lay down
awhile, Bob?

825
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:08,027
- Ain`t gonna skip out on me,
are ya?

826
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:12,869
Just pull up,

827
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,708
have yourself a drink
on Mr. Oonway,

828
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:19,273
and enjoy it.

some of that responsibility

895
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:47,515

896

01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,753
That`s why nobody
can see it comin`.

1059
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:27,831
Hi.

1060
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:30,203
- Give ya any trouble, Lou?

1061
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,730
- not at all.

1062
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:21,920
- Hi, honey.

1063
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,289
- l`m sorry.

1064
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,554
- lt`s all right.

1065
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:25,686
Where have you been?

1066
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,913
[moaning]

1067
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:33,118
[telephone ringing]

1068
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:37,690
- Yeah, hello?

1069
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:38,701
- Lou.

1070
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:39,827
Hendricks.

1071
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,063
- What is it, Howard?
lt`s late.

1072
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:42,571
- Johnnie Pappas.

1073
01:02:42,605 --> 01:02:44,266
You reaIIy put the fear of God
into the boy.

1074
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:46,332
- Sign a confession, did he?

1075
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:47,536
- WeII, more than that, Lou.

1076
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:48,942
He hanged himseIf.

1077
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:50,377
- Thank you for calling, Howard.

1078
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:52,904
l appreciate it.

1079
01:02:57,387 --> 01:03:01,118
- What was that all about?

1080
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:04,786
Hmm?

1081
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,455
- Johnnie Pappas hanged himself.

1082
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,225
- Oh, no, Lou.

1083
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:17,533
Baby, l`m so sorry.

1084
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:30,316
- After Johnnie`s death,
somethin` changed.

1085
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,947
It wasn`t anything
I couId put my finger on,

1086
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,957
but I got the feeIing
that peopIe were Iooking at me

1087
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,185
in a different way.

1088
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,202
Bob MapIes kept on drinkin`,

1089
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,730
and he seemed to age
about ten years.

1090
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,205
And nobody
taIked about Johnnie.

1091
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:59,477
But that didn`t stop me
from thinking about him,

1092
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:01,143
and I reaIized
a week had gone by,

1093
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:04,278
and I hadn`t paid my respects
to Max Pappas.

1094
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,947
- And here`s a Iook
at the weather picture.

1095
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,183
It`s gonna be the same.

1096
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:08,918
CIear today,
turning cooIer this afternoon.

1097
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,448
CIear and coIder tonight
and tomorrow.

1098
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:17,295
- l`m sorry, Officer Ford,
we`re not open for business.

1099
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,164
- Well, that`s all right.

1100
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:20,169
That`s all right, Max.

1101
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:23,468
l just wanted to-

1102
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:24,803
l just wanted to come by,

1103
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:28,436
and l`ve been meaning to come by
since that night,

1104
01:04:28,478 --> 01:04:30,969
and l wanted to just
tell you how sorry l am

1105
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:34,245
and had there been anything
l could`ve done,

1106
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:35,251
l would`ve done it.

1107
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:36,912
You know that.

1108
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:39,285
l`m sorry
that you`re closing down.

1109
01:04:39,322 --> 01:04:40,448
- l`m not closing.

1110
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:41,957
Why should l close?

1111
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:43,925
Just remodeling it.

1112
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,053
Adding some new booths,
a new floor.

1113
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:48,962
Just like Johnnie
would`ve liked it.

1114
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:52,123
- Well, that`s right.

1115
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:01,507
- Hurry up, Reggie.

1116
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:03,410
- But remember the FIick
rear window sticker

1117
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:06,938
can be the onIy contest sticker
of its kind on your car.

1118
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:12,849
- [laughs]

1119
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:14,447
- Did l do this?
- Mm-hmm.

1120
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:19,291
- % If %

1121
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:24,926
% You wait for me %

1122
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:28,267
% UntiI %

1123
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:33,765
% I come back home %

1124
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,041
% From far %

1125
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,642
% Across the sea %

1126
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:45,711
% I`II sing you my %

1127
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:51,125
% Korean Iove song %

1128
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,357
% I know %

1129
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:59,699
% You`re IoneIy too %

1130
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:02,830
% The days %

1131
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:08,367
% And nights are Iong %

1132
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:11,642
% But hear %

1133
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:17,017
% My Iove for you %

1134
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:20,511
% In my %

1135
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:23,719
% Korean Iove song %

1136
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:39,234
- Mind if l join ya?

1137
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,175
Thanks.

1138
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:43,201
l knew you wouldn`t.

1139
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,683
So you`re visiting
the scene of the crime.

1140
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,019
That`s what they call it,
isn`t it?

1141
01:06:54,057 --> 01:06:56,685
- What do you want?

1142
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:57,920
- l saw you headin` out
this way,

1143
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,325
and l wanted to have
a little talk.

1144
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,133
How many times you come here,
Lou?

1145
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,434
How many times you lay her?

1146
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:17,244
- l`m not so hard up for it
that l have to lay whores.

1147
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,872
- Sure.

1148
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:23,011
Tail like that,
man can live without, l suppose.

1149
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:25,782
But what could be substitute
for bullshit?

1150
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:29,553
Where would we be without it?

1151
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,753
- Well...

1152
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:34,820
l wouldn`t be listening
to you now.

1153
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:37,298
- Okay, let`s cut the bullshit.

1154
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,460
now, we both know
that Oonway`s looking

1155
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:42,096
to pin Elmer`s murder
on someone,

1156
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:45,938
and l`m just trying to make sure
that he doesn`t pin it on me.

1157
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:48,569
- Why would he do that?

1158
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:50,238
- Well, Oonway hates the union

1159
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,247
almost as much as l hate him.

1160
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:57,711
- Johnnie Pappas killed Elmer.

1161
01:07:57,754 --> 01:07:58,914
That`s why he hanged himself.

1162
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:02,557
- You been talking
to Max Pappas?

1163
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:03,786
- l was.

1164
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:05,453
- now, where do you suppose
he got the money

1165
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:06,553
for that kind of remodeling?

1166
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,292
- not my place to consider it.
- no.

1167
01:08:09,332 --> 01:08:11,163
Ohester Oonway`s jobbing
all the material.

1168
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,363
He`s paying off all the men.

1169
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:17,965
l mean, no one`s seen
a nickel coming from Pappas.

1170
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:19,770
l mean, doesn`t that strike you
as rather odd

1171
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:21,174
that he`d be doing a job
for a man

1172
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:24,737
whose son killed his boy?

1173
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:28,012
- Oonway takes all
the turnkey stuff he can get.

1174
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,143
Outs half a dozen profits
instead of one.

1175
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:33,519
- Well, l suppose so.

1176
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:35,387
So you been out
to Johnnie`s grave?

1177
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:38,292
- no, l`m ashamed to say
l haven`t done that yet.

1178
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:40,124
- Yeah, l bet.

1179
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:42,597
You know,
he`s buried on sacred ground.

1180
01:08:42,632 --> 01:08:44,930
You know what that means, Lou?

1181
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:47,492
- l reckon the church
didn`t call it a suicide.

1182
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:48,561
- Have any answer, Lou?

1183
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:50,037
Do we have an answer?

1184
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:53,838
- Well, he was so awful young,
l figure they cut him a break.

1185
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:03,241
- Yeah, maybe.

1186
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:06,346
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

1187
01:09:08,224 --> 01:09:10,158
You know,
there`s just one more thing.

1188
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:12,491
lt`s the big thing.

1189
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,262
now, on the Sunday night
that Elmer

1190
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:18,392
and the late occupant
of this cottage got it,

1191
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:23,167
one of my carpenters went to
the picture show at the Palace.

1192
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:30,009
Parked his car around back
at around 9:30.

1193
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:34,244
When he came back,
all four of his tires were gone.

1194
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:35,648
- Well, that`s funny.

1195
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:37,346
l didn`t hear anything about it.

1196
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:42,016
- lt`d been funny if you had,
Lou, `cause he didn`t report it.

1197
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,491
But he did mention it
to one of the boys

1198
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:44,959
at the Tuesday joiners` meeting,

1199
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:47,428
and one of them, it turned out
bought two of the tires

1200
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,023
from Johnnie Pappas.

1201
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:57,138
You feelin` the chill, Lou?

1202
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,141
- Jeez, l guess l don`t get you.

1203
01:10:00,176 --> 01:10:02,906
- The birds, Lou.

1204
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:05,004
Remember?

1205
01:10:05,047 --> 01:10:06,605
Starving sparrows.

1206
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:13,116
- lf Johnnie Pappas had an alibi
for the night of the murders,

1207
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:14,179
then he would`ve told me,

1208
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:16,714
and he wouldn`t
have hanged himself.

1209
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,386
- He trusted you.

1210
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:21,730
He liked you.

1211
01:10:21,764 --> 01:10:23,231
You were his friend.

1212
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:29,501
- l was his friend.

1213
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:34,832
- Okay.

1214
01:10:34,877 --> 01:10:37,607
That`s fine.

1215
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:38,841
That`s fine, Lou.

1216
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:42,248
But you think you`re so clever,
don`t ya?

1217
01:10:42,285 --> 01:10:45,743
But Oonway, he ain`t no fool.

1218
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:47,915
So if l were you,
l wouldn`t hang around.

1219
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,721
- You know, l thought about
leaving town.

1220
01:10:52,762 --> 01:10:53,729
- Yeah?

1221
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:57,529
Sounds like a good idea, Lou.

1222
01:10:57,567 --> 01:11:00,365
That`s a good idea.

1223
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,268
[door slams]

1224
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,899
- What?

1225
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:33,902
What?

1226
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:36,928
[laughs]

1227
01:11:38,074 --> 01:11:40,542
Lou, why don`t we-
- Amy, why-

1228
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:42,601
- Bread `n butter.
- Bread `n butter.

1229
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:44,977
Bad luck stay away
from my darlin`.

1230
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:47,073
- You do want to still, right?

1231
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:48,276
Honest and truly?

1232
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:50,478
- Didn`t l just
start to ask you?

1233
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:51,486
- How?

1234
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,487
When?

1235
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:53,920
l mean, what were you-

1236
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:56,220
- Well, l was thinking
in a couple weeks-

1237
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:57,691
- l was thinking the same.

1238
01:11:57,727 --> 01:11:59,217
Darlin`, l was just
gonna say that.

1239
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:00,228
- What?

1240
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:01,229
- Well, l was gonna-

1241
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,252
What were you thinking?

1242
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:03,765
- l was thinking
that we should elope.

1243
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:11,195
- You want to elope?

1248

- Well, l`m sorry, stranger,

1249
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:50,368
the doctor
doesn`t practice anymore.

1250
01:12:50,413 --> 01:12:51,505
- Oh, that`s okay, bud.

1251
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:52,536
lt`s just a little burn.

1252
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,173
- Doesn`t make any difference.

1253
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:57,879
- Yeah, a cigar burn.

1254
01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:04,691
See, you and me, we got some
talkin` to do and, uh...

1255
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:05,694
l`m thirsty.

1256
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:08,390
You got any whisky around?

1257
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:09,659
- no, but l got a phone.

1258
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:11,326
The jail`s
about six blocks away.

1259
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:13,335
- Well, why don`t you go
right ahead with that, bud?

1260
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:14,961
Go right ahead.

1261
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:17,336
But it`ll cost ya.

1262
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:19,898
And it won`t be just the price
of one burned hand.

1263
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:32,944
- All right, let`s have it.

1264
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:35,786
- l did a year stretch
at the Houston pea farm,

1265
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:37,622
and l seen
a couple of guys like you.

1266
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,991
- ls that right?

1267
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:41,428
- So l figured it might pay
to watch you a little.

1268
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:44,797
l followed you that night,

1269
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,768
and l heard some of that talk
you was havin`

1270
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:48,167
with that labor fella.

1271
01:13:48,204 --> 01:13:51,662
- Well, l reckon that meant
a whole lot to ya, did it?

1272
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:52,901
- no, no, no, no,

1273
01:13:52,942 --> 01:13:55,137
it hardly meant anything to me
at all.

1274
01:13:55,177 --> 01:13:57,270
Matter of fact,
it didn`t mean much to me

1275
01:13:57,313 --> 01:13:59,110
a couple of nights later

1276
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:03,744
when you come up to that
little shack l was camping in,

1277
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:06,550
and then you cut cross prairie
to that little yellow house.

1278
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:10,389
Did you say
you had some whisky, bud?

1279
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:18,565
Yeah, you see,
l caught up on the news.

1280
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:22,128
And then them things
that you done and you said,

1281
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:25,572
well, they suddenly
meant plenty.

1282
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,872
- [sighs]

1283
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,651
l don`t have much money.

1284
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,883
- Yeah.

1285
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:44,654
Well, you got this place.

1286
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:47,787
Must be worth
a tidy little sum too.

1287
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:54,433
- Maybe l could get a loan.

1288
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,802
- How long do you think
it would take to get this loan?

1289
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:58,898
- Two weeks.

1290
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:08,509
- $5,000.

1291
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:12,647
$5,000 in two weeks.

1292
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:16,556
5:00, two weeks from tonight,
and we`ll call that a deal.

1293
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:20,221
And don`t worry, l ain`t a hog
about money or nothin`.

1294
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:22,230
l get the $5,000,

1295
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:24,095
that`s the last
we`ll ever see of each other.

1296
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:30,296
- Well...

1297
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:31,863
all right.

1298
01:15:36,212 --> 01:15:38,510
- Oh, and don`t you go
gettin` no notions

1299
01:15:38,547 --> 01:15:41,448
about running out on me.

1300
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,110
- Do you think l`m crazy?

1301
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,821
- You ask
an unpleasant question, bud,

1302
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:48,790
you might get
an unpleasant answer.

1303
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:08,171
- I went to work every
working day of those two weeks.

1304
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:09,575
- Morning, Jeff.

1305
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:11,079
- Howdy, Lou.

1306
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,583
- Chester Conway came
to taIk to Hendricks,

1307
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:18,143
and I made it my job
to see him.

1308
01:16:18,187 --> 01:16:19,779
- Mr. Oonway.

1309
01:16:19,822 --> 01:16:21,153
- Lou.

1310
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,589
- l`d like to talk to you
for a second.

1311
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:23,592
- Mm-hmm.

1312
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,059
What about?

1313
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:27,119
- l should`ve gone out
with Elmer just like you said.

1314
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:30,928
And if cussin` me out
will make you feel any better

1315
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:32,092
or if you want my job,

1316
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:33,965
Lord knows
you can have it.

1317
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:37,302
l sure won`t hold a grudge.

1318
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:38,397
- Elmer trusted you.

1319
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,567
l trusted you.

1320
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:45,137
- Appreciate that.

1321
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,375
- Hey, Lou.

1322
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,577
l think you`re gonna
like this one.

1323
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:51,779
- Amy came to see me every day.

1324
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,187
She aIways brought some cake
or pie or somethin`.

1325
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:57,249
And she had to take it
kind of easy when she sat down.

1326
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:10,932
We`d sit outside
and have a drink,

1327
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:12,702
and I`d think how much
she Iooked Iike her.

1328
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:17,236
And afterwards,
she`d Iie in my arms,

1329
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,443
and I couId aImost fooI myseIf
into thinking it was her.

1330
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:22,450
But it wasn`t her.

1331
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,111
And for that matter,

1332
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,951
it wouIdn`t have made
any difference if it had been.

1333
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:29,355
I`d just be right back
where I started.

1334
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:33,193
I took her everywhere
she wanted to go,

1335
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:34,786
did everything
she wanted to do.

1336
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,161
It wasn`t any troubIe.

1337
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,224
She didn`t want to go much
or do much.

1338
01:17:39,268 --> 01:17:41,361
For the first time
in I don`t remember when,

1339
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:43,735
my mind was reaIIy free.

1340
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:54,207
I knew I had to kiII Amy.

1341
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:55,739
I couId put the reason
into words.

1342
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:57,081
But every time
I thought about it,

1343
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,610
I had to stop
and think why again.

1344
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:02,123
I`d be doing somethin`,
reading a book or somethin`,

1345
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:03,784
and aII of a sudden,
it wouId come over me

1346
01:18:03,826 --> 01:18:05,487
that I was gonna kiII her,

1347
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:09,793
and the idea seemed so crazy
that I`d aImost Iaugh out Ioud.

1348
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:12,130
Then I`d start thinking,
and I`d see it,

1349
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,158
see that it had to be done.

1350
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,674
Bob, Amy and me got somethin`
mighty important to do tonight,

1351
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:24,679
and l`m gonna be out
Monday and Tuesday.

1352
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:27,978
- Oh, well, now.

1353
01:18:28,017 --> 01:18:31,783
Well, now,
you don`t think maybe you-

1354
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,651
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1355
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:35,520
That`s good news, Lou.

1356
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:36,649
That`s real good news.

1357
01:18:36,692 --> 01:18:39,820
l know you`re gonna be
happy together.

1358
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:41,557
- l feel pretty lucky.

1359
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:43,189
Feel like my life`s
a picture show.

1360
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:47,794
- They don`t come any better
than little Amy.

1361
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,462
Yes, sir.

1362
01:18:51,507 --> 01:18:52,997
Gonna be good.

Darlin`?

1378
01:19:44,927 --> 01:19:47,157
Well, you`re not even ready yet.

1379
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:49,494
Here you are
on our day of elopement-

1380
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:50,657
- Don`t say anything, Amy.

1381
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:51,859
Don`t say anything.

1382
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,026
- Don`t say-

1383
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:54,365
- All l want to say is
how much l love you.

1384
01:19:54,803 --> 01:19:55,895
Oh!

- You got the money?

1392
01:22:39,368 --> 01:22:40,767
- Put that in your pocket.

01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:43,566
l have the rest back

Get to your mom and dad!

1405
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:31,408
- What`s goin` on?

1406
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,083
- Hey!

1407
01:23:41,863 --> 01:23:42,989

1408
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:44,521
Help!

1409
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:45,590
Help! Help!

1410
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:47,363
- Murderer!

1411
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:52,604
He killed Amy Stanton!

1412
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:54,233
Murderer!

1413
01:23:54,276 --> 01:23:55,334
- Help me!

1414
01:23:55,377 --> 01:23:56,344
- He killed Amy Stanton!

1415
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:57,504
- Anybody!
Somebody!

1416
01:23:57,546 --> 01:23:58,638
- Halt!

1417
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,647
- He`s a murderer!

1418
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:00,648
He killed Amy Stanton!

1419
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:02,343
- Help!

1420
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:03,715
Help!
- Halt!

1421
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,744
[gunshot]

1422
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:09,685
- Murderer!

1423
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:11,215
- Halt!

1424
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:13,318
- He killed Amy Stanton!

1425
01:24:13,362 --> 01:24:15,694
[gunshots]

1426
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:24,361
- Stay back!

1427
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:25,373
Back up.

1428
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:26,396
Stay back!

1429
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:29,706
Stay back!

1430
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:31,406
Get an ambulance, now.

1431
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:34,279
- [growling]

1432
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:38,685
- Please step back.

1433
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,687
no, go home, now.

1434
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,552
Go home.

1435
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:42,750
Go on home.

1436
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:44,122
We`re all done here.

1437
01:24:57,806 --> 01:25:00,798
- [retches]

1438
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:24,789
[whistling]

1439
01:25:44,486 --> 01:25:48,252
- Gosh, Jeff,
how long you been out here?

1440
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,850
- Reckon l been here
quite a spell.

1441
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:51,950
- Well, come on in.

1442
01:25:51,993 --> 01:25:52,960
l was just fixin` some-

1443
01:25:52,994 --> 01:25:56,088
- Kind of like it where l am.

1444
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:59,464
Air smells real good.

1445
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:03,460
lt`s been smelling real good,
anyways.

1446
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:08,865
- Where is everybody?

1447
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,775
l figured they`d come by.

1448
01:26:10,812 --> 01:26:14,179
- Told `em you wasn`t up to it.

1449
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:17,344
Told `em you was all broke up
about Bob Maples.

1450
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:19,285
- About Bob?

1451
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:23,451
- Shot hisself last night
around midnight.

1452
01:26:23,492 --> 01:26:25,084
Yes, sir.

1453
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:29,222
Poor ol` Bob killed hisself.

1454
01:26:29,264 --> 01:26:32,665
And l reckon l know
just how he felt.

1455
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:44,677
- Sure you don`t want
a cup of coffee?

1456
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:47,045
- no, thank you.

1457
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:08,160
- Last night`s events,
these recent events,

1458
01:27:08,203 --> 01:27:09,795
l don`t like `em one bit.

1459
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:12,102
- Well, that`s only natural,
Howard.

1460
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,108
l don`t see how you could.

1461
01:27:14,142 --> 01:27:15,973
l mean, l don`t like `em
one bit, either.

1462
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:19,913
- Well, now, take this drifter,

1463
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:23,782
this alleged robber rapist
that you`d have us believe

1464
01:27:23,818 --> 01:27:26,412
robbed and raped Miss Stanton.

1465
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:29,218
We know he didn`t do it.

1466
01:27:29,257 --> 01:27:30,349
He`s a pipeline worker.

1467
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:32,087
He had a pocket full of wages.

1468
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:34,994
You`re not gonna get away
with planting that money on him.

1469
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:36,156
- What money?

1470
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:38,722
- The money you stole
from Elmer Oonway.

1471
01:27:38,767 --> 01:27:40,564
The money you stole
the night you killed him

1472
01:27:40,602 --> 01:27:41,569
and that whore Lakeland.

1473
01:27:41,603 --> 01:27:42,900
- Why would l kill
Joyce Lakeland?

1474
01:27:42,938 --> 01:27:44,235
- `Oause you killed
Elmer Oonway.

1475
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:45,466
You had to shut her up.

1476
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,302
- Why would l kill Elmer Oonway?

1477
01:27:48,343 --> 01:27:49,503
l`ve known him all my life.

1478
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:51,273
- You killed him;
you killed Joyce Lakeland;

1479
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:52,575
you hanged Johnnie Pappas.

1480
01:27:52,614 --> 01:27:55,014
- Howard, you`re not
making any sense.

1481
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:56,950
- You killed Johnnie Pappas
to protect yourself.

1482
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:59,249
You`d given him
that marked $20 bill.

1483
01:27:59,287 --> 01:28:01,278
- How much money went missing?

1484
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,655
$500?

1485
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:05,819
You`re saying that l killed
Elmer Oonway for $500?

1486
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,589
- l`m saying Johnnie Pappas
wasn`t anywhere

1487
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:08,823
near the scene of those murders.

1488
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:09,830
- l never believed that.

1489
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:11,229
- He was stealing tires
at the time.

1490
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,860
- Johnnie Pappas was my friend.

1491
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:16,928
That was your theory.

1492
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:21,033
- You think you got it
all figured out, don`t ya?

1493
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:23,601
Four, five murders.

1494
01:28:23,645 --> 01:28:25,510
Six if you count
poor Bob Maples,

1495
01:28:25,547 --> 01:28:27,538
staked everything he had on ya.

1496
01:28:27,582 --> 01:28:31,313
And you just sit there
explainin` and smilin`.

1497
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:36,188
You ain`t bothered one bit.

1498
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:38,283
How can you do it, Ford?

1499
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:40,055
How can you just sit there
and do that?

1500
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:42,529
- Well, somebody`s got to keep
their head around here.

1501
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:47,160
Any more questions?

1502
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,602
- Yeah, l got one.

1503
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:54,200
- Shoot.

1504
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,802
- How did Miss Stanton
get those bruises on her body?

1505
01:28:56,845 --> 01:28:58,403
Old bruises,
not made last night.

1506
01:28:58,446 --> 01:29:01,176
Same kind of bruises we found
on the Lakeland woman`s body.

1507
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:04,151
How do you think she got them,
Lou?

1508
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:06,585
- Oh, gosh Howard,
you got me there.

1509
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:07,645
How would l know?

1510
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:08,815
- You`d been beatin` on her

1511
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:11,325
just like you
beat on that whore.

1512
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:15,853
- So l was beatin` on Amy,
and she kept right on seeing me?

1513
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:20,960
l was bruisin` her up,
and she was fixin` to marry me?

1514
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:22,435
Boy, you didn`t know
Amy Stanton.

1515
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:27,339
- Maybe you didn`t know
Amy Stanton

1516
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,501
as well as you thought you did.

1517
01:29:28,543 --> 01:29:29,840
- ls that right?

1518
01:29:29,878 --> 01:29:32,210
- This was in her purse.

1519
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:33,976
Apparently she intended to
have you stop

1520
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:36,882
at some restaurant down the road
and have you read it.

1521
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:40,081
now it begins, ``Lou Darling.``
- Let me have it.

1522
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:41,554
- l`ll read it.
- lt`s his letter.

1523
01:29:41,589 --> 01:29:42,681
Let him have it.

1524
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:45,884
- Very well.

1525
01:29:54,135 --> 01:29:55,796
- ``Lou DarIing...

1526
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:57,634
``Now you know why
I had you stop here

1527
01:29:57,672 --> 01:30:00,402
``and why I`ve excused myseIf
from the tabIe.

1528
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:02,467
``It was to aIIow you
to read this,

1529
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:05,673
``the things I couIdn`t
somehow otherwise say to you.

1530
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:07,739
``Lou, I beg you,
pIease, pIease,

1531
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:10,751
``pIease not to take it
the wrong way.

1532
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:12,719
``But I`m afraid.

1533
01:30:12,754 --> 01:30:15,120
``Are you in troubIe?

1534
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,056
``Now, I don`t want to ask you
more than that,

1535
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:19,617
``but I do want you to beIieve
that whatever it is,

1536
01:30:19,661 --> 01:30:21,094
``even if it`s what I-

1537
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:23,859
``whatever it is, Lou,
I`m on your side.

1538
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:25,627
``I Iove you.

1539
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,658
``Are you tired of
my saying that?

1540
01:30:27,702 --> 01:30:30,637
``I know you`d never knowingIy
do anything wrong.

1541
01:30:30,672 --> 01:30:33,163
``So even if it shouId invoIve

1545
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:46,377

01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:47,979
``you`II stiII be there.

1547
01:30:48,022 --> 01:30:50,115
``But if you feeI

01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:52,752
``then just Ieave my bags

1549
01:30:52,794 --> 01:30:54,022
``I have money with me,

``AIways, darIing,

01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:06,773
AIways and forever,
Amy. ``

1555
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,606
- She was so damn talkie,
wasn`t she?

1556
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,015
l mean, just the sweetest thing,

1557
01:31:17,051 --> 01:31:19,019
but just talk a fencepost
right out of a field.

1558
01:31:19,053 --> 01:31:20,111
- You dirty son of a bitch.

1559
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:21,213
- Don`t say that to me.

1560
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:22,518
- no, don`t say that.

1561
01:31:22,557 --> 01:31:24,582
Don`t never say anything
about a man`s mother.

1562
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:25,923
- To hell with that crap.

1563
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,427
You killed that little girl.

1564
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:31,023
She as good as says so.

1565
01:31:31,065 --> 01:31:36,901
- She wrote it down
after l killed her?

1566
01:31:36,938 --> 01:31:38,496
That`s quite a trick, Howard.

1567
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,235
- You killed them, Ford.

1568
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:42,505
You killed them all.

1569
01:31:50,451 --> 01:31:52,715
- Know what that thing is
right there?

1570
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:54,187
Over by Jeff?

1571
01:31:54,222 --> 01:31:55,689
lt`s called a door.

1572
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:58,214
now, l can`t think of a thing
to keep you

1573
01:31:58,259 --> 01:32:00,284
and Mr. Plummer
from walking through it.

1574
01:32:00,328 --> 01:32:03,195
- l sure liked Bob Maples.

1575
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:05,290
l sure liked

you ain`t comin` with us?

you could change your mind?

1581
01:32:19,514 --> 01:32:20,742

had kiIIed himseIf.

for a week.

1584

I guess they thought
that`d break me.

1585
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,185
But it didn`t,
just gave me time to think.

1586

On the eighth day,

1587
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:34,693
they transferred me
to the insane asyIum.

1588

I didn`t see that comin`.

1589
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:45,564

or even questioned me there.

that was a good sign.

1591

But in my heart I knew.

1592

I knew they must have
some evidence.

with that poor man?

1600
01:34:01,783 --> 01:34:04,308
Have you torn out his tongue?

1601
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:08,288
Have you roasted his poor
broken body over slow fires?

1602
01:34:08,323 --> 01:34:09,722
He has come!

1603
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:11,122

Mr. Ford,

You know why?

1626
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:07,174
- Well, l reckon he`s scared.

1627
01:35:07,215 --> 01:35:09,979
He figures they`re gonna pin
the Elmer Oonway murder on me,

1628
01:35:10,018 --> 01:35:11,918
and he thinks l`m gonna
drag him into it.

into a fix.

your story.

You don`t have to,
you understand,

1643

1644

to help somebody else.

1646
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,181
- l never had any
legal schoolin`, Mr. Ford.

1647
01:36:15,216 --> 01:36:19,016
l pick up my law by reading
in a attorney`s office.

1648
01:36:19,053 --> 01:36:22,580
All the higher education
l ever had was

1649
01:36:22,623 --> 01:36:24,454
two years at
in agricultural college,

1650
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:26,960
and that was pretty much
a plain waste of time.

1651
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:28,985
l just learned two things
at that college, Mr. Ford,

1652

in my cornfield,

1659
01:36:54,789 --> 01:36:56,416
and that`s a weed.

1660
