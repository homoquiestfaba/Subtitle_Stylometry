2
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,189
The war had all but ground to a halt
in the blink of an eye.

3
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,598
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless
leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...

4
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,363
...had finally been killed.

5
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,000
The Lycan horde
scattered to the wind...

6
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,510
...in a single evening
of flame and retribution.

7
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,819
Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...

8
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,854
...the very birthright of the Vampires.

9
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,124
Nearly six centuries had passed
since that night.

10
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:43,531
Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling
to follow Lucian to the grave.

11
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,636
Though Lycans were
fewer in number...

12
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,104
...the war itself had become
more perilous.

13
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,670
For the moon no longer
held her sway.

14
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,373
Older, more powerful Lycans
were now able to change at will.

15
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,852
The weapons had evolved,
but our orders remained the same:

16
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,822
Hunt them down and kill them off,
one by one.

17
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,395
A most successful campaign.

18
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,964
Perhaps too successful.

19
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,411
For those like me, a Death Dealer...

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,174
...this signaled the end of an era.

21
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,081
Like the weapons
of the previous century...

22
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,813
...we, too, would become obsolete.

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,390
Pity, because I lived for it.

24
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,961
Bloods!

25
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,274
lt's all right. lt's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

26
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,112
You're acting like a pack
of rabid dogs!

27
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,421
And that, gentlemen...

28
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,454
...simply will not do.

29
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,891
Not if you expect to defeat
the Vampires on their own ground.

30
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,460
Not if you expect to survive at all.

31
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,463
Pierce! Taylor!

32
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,099
Put some clothes on, will you?

33
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,838
We have a serious problem.

34
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,927
l'll have to run a few tests.

35
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,933
lt's definitely an irradiated fluid
of some sort.

36
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,764
Ultraviolet ammunition.

37
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,068
Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.

38
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,976
You expect me to believe
that a mangy animal...

39
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,504
...came up with a bullet specifically
engineered to kill Vampires?

40
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,443
No, l'm betting it's military.

41
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,909
Something they stole.
Some sort of high-tech tracer round.

42
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,213
l don't care where
they got these things.

43
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,289
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel
could still be out there.

44
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,688
Let's gather the Death Dealers
and go back.

45
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,829
Absolutely not. Not now.
Not for a random incursion.

46
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,990
The Awakening is a few days off,
and this house is in unrest as it is.

47
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,763
Random? They opened fire on us
in full view of the public.

48
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,999
-And from what l heard in that tunnel--
-You said you didn't see anything.

49
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,246
l know what l heard,
and l know what my gut tells me.

50
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,745
There could be dozens
of Lycans down there.

51
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,850
Who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.

52
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,643
We've hunted them
to the brink of extinction.

53
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,117
Kraven's right, Selene.

54
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,260
There's not been a den
of that magnitude for centuries.

55
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,225
-Not since the days of Lucian.
-l know that, Kahn.

56
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,195
But l'd rather you prove me wrong
by checking it out.

57
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,700
Have your men tighten things up.

58
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,031
l'll have Soren assemble
a search team.

59
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:05,576
-No, l want to lead the team myself.
-Absolutely not! Soren will handle it.

60
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,575
Hundreds, really?

61
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,580
Viktor would believe me.

62
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,418
-l'd never treat you like that.
-Of course not.

63
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:23,852
Now run along and make sure she's
dressed and ready for her guests.

64
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,292
-lt's a waste of time, you know.
-What is?

65
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,564
l doubt Viktor would want you freezing
in here, staring at his tomb for hours.

66
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:45,403
No, he'd want the Death Dealers out
there, scouring every inch of the city.

67
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:49,946
Kraven. l'll never understand
why Viktor left him in charge.

68
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,549
He's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.

69
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,117
We need to get you ready.

70
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,549
-For what?
-The party.

71
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,419
Amelia's envoy will be here
any minute.

72
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,110
Oh, yes.

73
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,448
You should definitely wear this one.
lt's perfect.

74
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,976
They were after you.

75
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,219
He's attractive...

76
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,823
-...for a human.
-Who's attractive?

77
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,175
l planned to have you
at my side this evening.

78
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,744
Take Erika.
She's dying to be at your side.

79
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,145
lf you ask me, you take this warrior
business far too seriously.

80
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,788
You can't undo the past,
no matter how many you kill.

81
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,194
And besides...

82
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,822
...what's the point
in being immortal...

83
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,489
...if you deny yourself
life's simple pleasures?

84
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,602
Do you see this human?

85
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,564
-What of him?
-l'm beginning to think the Lycans--

86
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,298
Blast!

87
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,042
Put on something elegant
and be quick about it.

88
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,653
Kraven, l'm serious.
l think they were following him.

89
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,522
Other than food,
why would Lycans stalk a human?

90
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,972
Any progress?

91
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,631
Let's find out.

92
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,443
Negative.

93
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,596
You heading home?

94
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah, Nicholas gave me
a couple hours off.

95
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,501
By the way...

96
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,975
...he said you did a terrific job
tonight with the surgery.

97
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,579
Yeah.

98
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,311
Take it easy.

99
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,952
We were ambushed.

100
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,951
Death Dealers, three of them.

101
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,615
-And the candidate?
-We lost him.

102
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,782
You lost him?

103
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,622
Look at this mess.

104
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,562
Ag rounds. High content.

105
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,828
Prevented him from
making the change.

106
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,702
No use in digging out the rest.
Silver's penetrated his organs.

107
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,473
Regeneration's impossible
at this point.

108
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,144
Let's take these out.

109
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,186
Relax.

110
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,992
The Vampires didn't realize
you were following a human...

111
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,333
-...did they, Raze?
-No.

112
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,240
l mean, l don't think so.

113
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,141
-You don't think, or you don't know?
-l'm not sure.

114
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,392
Negative.

115
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,229
l really must have a look
at this Michael.

116
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,999
Must l do everything myself?

117
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:38,780
Our noble houses may be
separated by a great ocean...

118
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:43,985
...but we are equally committed
to the survival of the bloodlines.

119
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,154
And when Amelia arrives
to awaken Marcus...

120
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,426
...in just two days' time...

121
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:55,330
...we shall once again
be united as a single coven!

122
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,810
We want to thank our hosts
for their generous hospitality.

123
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,373
He comes in, he does his job
and then he goes home.

124
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,210
Other than that,
I don't know what to tell you.

125
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,512
Interns work around the clock.
We don't have much of a life.

126
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,985
You know where we can find him?

127
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,554
No.

128
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:24,219
You can try him at home,
or you'll have to wait till he gets back.

129
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,728
He's not in some kind
of trouble, is he?

130
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,876
This is Michael. I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.

131
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,883
Michael, it's Adam. The police were
just in the hospital looking for you.

132
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,920
They were convinced you were
involved with a shootout.

133
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,259
I told them there's no way
you'd be involved with that...

134
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,587
...but they're looking for you.
Right now.

135
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,529
Why are they after you?

136
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,416
Shit!

137
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,305
Hello, Michael.

138
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,519
What the fuck is going on?

139
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,266
Stop the car.

140
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,131
Stop the car!

141
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,298
Back off!

142
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,966
Okay.

143
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,244
Okay.

144
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,146
All right.

145
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,647
But you've lost a lot of blood.

146
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,686
lf you don't stop the car,
you'll get us both killed.

147
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,623
-l'm not screwing around!
-Neither am l!

148
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,559
Shut up and hold on.
l'll be fine.

149
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,428
Shit!

150
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,875
A second escape. lmpressive.

151
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,102
Perhaps Raze wasn't
overstating matters.

152
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,940
Raze didn't bring back this.

153
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,624
lf Michael is indeed The Carrier,
the Vampires could--

154
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,391
Relax, old friend.

155
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,294
l've tasted his flesh.

156
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,363
Just two days till full moon.

157
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,166
Soon, he will be a Lycan.

158
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,870
Soon, he will come looking for us.

159
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,627
lt's a shame we don't have more.

160
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,145
Positive.

161
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,262
Lay still. Your skull's
taken a good knock.

162
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,435
You've been unconscious
for a while.

163
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,871
Do you have any idea
why those men were after you?

164
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,971
Where am l?

165
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,641
You're safe.

166
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,451
l'm Selene.

167
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,858
So, for once, the rumors were true.

168
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:11,505
The whole house has been absolutely
buzzing about your new pet.

169
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:18,479
-Are you going to try to turn him?
-Of course not.

170
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,679
So why did you bring him here?

171
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,220
He saved my life.

172
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,654
-Why are you here?
-Kraven sent me.

173
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,558
He wants to see you. Now.

174
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,733
This is completely unacceptable!

175
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,066
You go against my orders and spend
the night away from the mansion...

176
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,678
...with a human? A human you've
since brought back to my house.

177
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:52,043
As far as l'm concerned,
this is still Viktor's house.

178
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,485
Look, l don't want to argue.

179
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,781
Understand that Michael is somehow
important to the Lycans--

180
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,016
-So now it's ''Michael''!
-Would you just hear me out--

181
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,788
lt's beyond me why you're so
obsessed over this ridiculous theory.

182
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,488
Lucian wouldn't be a bit
interested in a human...

183
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,226
...Michael or otherwise.

184
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,569
Wait a minute.

185
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,302
You're infatuated with him,
aren't you?

186
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,672
Now, that's a ridiculous theory.

187
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,611
ls it?

188
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,062
Leave us!

189
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,660
l sure hope you never get
pissed off with me.

190
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,464
Hold on.

191
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,403
Check this out.

192
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,875
Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.

193
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,557
Eject the mag.

194
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,566
You've copied the Lycan rounds.
Silver nitrate.

195
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,400
A lethal dose.

196
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,065
They won't dig these out,
like our usual rounds.

197
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,679
Straight into the bloodstream.
Ain't nothing to dig out.

198
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,010
Tell me, Kahn.

199
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,815
Do you believe Lucian died
the way they say?

200
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,254
-Kraven telling war stories again?
-That's my point.

201
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,623
lt's nothing but an ancient story.
His story.

202
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,993
There's not a shred of proof
he killed Lucian, only his word.

203
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,192
l've never underestimated
Kraven's lust for advancement...

204
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,237
...but Viktor believed him
and that's all that matters.

205
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,239
-Where you going with this anyway?
-Nowhere.

206
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,398
Engaging Death Dealers in public
and chasing after some human...

207
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,799
...was not what l had in mind. You
were told to set up shop and lay low!

208
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,066
Calm yourself, Kraven!

209
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,709
The human doesn't concern you.

210
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:22,780
And besides, l've laid low
for quite long enough.

211
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,898
Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.

212
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,931
At least for the time being.

213
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,334
Don't force me to regret
our arrangement.

214
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,100
You just concentrate on your part.

215
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,607
Remember, l've bled for you
once already.

216
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,408
Without me, you'd have nothing.

217
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,950
You'd be nothing.

218
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:17,565
Of the scores of brave souls
who entered Lucian's fortress...

219
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,671
...a single Vampire survived:
Kraven...

220
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,639
...who was richly rewarded
for not only setting the great blaze...

221
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,768
...but for returning with evidence
of the Lycan master's demise...

222
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:33,940
...the branded skin,
cut from Lucian's very arm.

223
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,409
l've been looking for you.
He's been bitten.

224
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,650
Your human,
he's been marked by a Lycan.

225
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,187
-Did Kraven put you up to this?
-No.

226
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,884
l saw the wound with my own eyes,
l swear it.

227
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,089
But what about the Covenant?

228
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,495
You know it's forbidden!

229
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,975
And ever since he bit me,
l've been--

230
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:39,515
l've been having these hallucinations
and these delusions.

231
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:45,988
All l know is, it feels like
my skull is splitting in half.

232
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,716
Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?

233
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,386
Jesus.

234
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,327
Are you sure this wasn't a dog?

235
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,899
l said, it was a man.
lt was a man.

236
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,401
-Okay, l got it.
-He was after me.

237
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,133
-And that woman from the subway--
-What woman?

238
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,376
Haven't you been listening to me?
She took me hostage!

239
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,036
All right.

240
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,580
Just-- Please.

241
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,617
l'll help you get this all sorted out,
all right? l'll be right back.

242
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,657
Let go, Michael.

243
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,751
Let go.

244
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,492
Just calm down, okay?
l'm gonna be back in a minute.

245
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,635
-That's a promise.
-All right.

246
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,365
Please forgive me...

247
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,508
...but l desperately need
your guidance.

248
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,723
To my knowledge...

249
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:17,333
...an Awakening has never been
attempted by one such as myself.

250
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:21,496
The elders hold the power to organize
their memories and thoughts...

251
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,799
...into a single, cohesive vision...

252
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,909
...a detailed record of their reign.

253
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,979
I can only hope Viktor
will hear my plea.

254
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,644
Please forgive me,
but l desperately need your guidance.

255
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:48,083
l apologize for awakening you
ahead of schedule...

256
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,818
...but l fear we may all be
in grave danger.

257
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:55,525
Especially you, my lord,
if left in your weakened state.

258
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,163
For l believe that Lucian
is alive and well.

259
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,434
Here. Now. ln this very city...

260
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,872
...preparing to hit us
during the Awakening ceremony.

261
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,304
Even more disturbing...

262
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,348
...is that if l'm correct...

263
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,280
...it would mean that Kraven
is in league with him.

264
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,895
What's so pressing?

265
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,306
Take a look.

266
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,277
Selene!

267
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,442
I want to speak with Selene!

268
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,385
ls that Michael?

269
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,459
-ls it Michael?
-What the hell is going on?

270
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,925
What's happening to me?

271
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,056
I'm coming out.

272
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,630
lf you go to him, you'll never
be welcome in this house again.

273
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:18,339
Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see
what he has to say about that.

274
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:32,844
Get in.

275
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,875
Look, l warned her. l warned her,
but she didn't listen.

276
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,317
-l should've told you sooner.
-Told me what?

277
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:10,190
Her human, Michael...

278
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,852
...he's not a human at all.

279
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,190
He's a Lycan.

280
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,134
What?

281
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,966
What's this ruckus?

282
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,538
Never come here again.
They'll kill you.

283
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,706
Why? Who are you people?

284
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,052
Leave us.

285
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:32,367
Like it or not, you're in the middle
of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.

286
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,636
A blood feud between
Vampires and Lycans.

287
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,473
Werewolves.

288
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,857
Consider yourself lucky.

289
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,260
Most humans die within an hour
of being bitten by an immortal.

290
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,333
The viruses we transmit are deadly.

291
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,732
And if you bit me,
l'd become a Vampire instead?

292
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,236
No, you'd die.

293
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,441
No one's ever survived
a bite from both species.

294
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,136
By rights, l'd stop the car
and kill you myself--

295
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,213
-Why are you helping me?
-l'm not.

296
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,850
l track down and kill your kind.

297
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,647
My only interest is finding out
why Lucian wants you so badly.

298
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,984
Do you know why l've
been awakened, servant?

299
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,026
No, my lord.

300
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,633
-But l'll soon find out.
-You mean when you find her.

301
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,495
-Yes, my lord.
-You must let her come to me.

302
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:40,166
We have much to discuss,
Selene and l.

303
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:46,405
She has shown me
a great many disturbing things.

304
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,848
Things that will be dealt with
soon enough.

305
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,979
This coven has grown weak,
decadent.

306
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:59,493
Perhaps l should have left someone
else in charge of my affairs.

307
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,000
Still...

308
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,135
...her memories...

309
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,031
...are chaotic.

310
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,205
There's no sense of time.

311
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:17,710
Please, my lord,
let me summon assistance.

312
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,576
You're in need of rest.

313
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,247
l've rested enough.

314
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:27,179
What you will do
is summon Marcus.

315
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:34,085
But he still slumbers, my lord.

316
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:39,231
Amelia and the Council members
are arriving tomorrow night...

317
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:41,427
...to awaken Marcus.

318
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,097
Not you, my lord.

319
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:48,404
You've been awakened
a full century ahead of schedule.

320
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,089
l'm seeing these things,
these hallucinations.

321
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,929
They're not hallucinations,
they're memories.

322
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,904
You've been bitten. His memories
have been passed to you.

323
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:26,246
This is one of the places we use
for interrogations. lt should be safe.

324
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,299
-Ziodex lndustries.
-We own it.

325
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,265
First there was synthetic plasma,
now this.

326
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,235
Once it's approved,
it should be our newest cash crop.

327
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,307
lt's cloned blood.

328
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,341
What are these for?

329
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,476
Lycans are allergic to silver.

330
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,248
lf we don't get our bullets out quickly,
they die during questioning.

331
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,786
What do you do with them after?

332
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,194
We put the bullets back in.

333
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,813
-How are things progressing?
-We're ready.

334
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,543
Why do you hate them so much?

335
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,817
l've already told you,
we're at war.

336
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,719
So you're just following orders?

337
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,529
Why can't you just answer
the question?

338
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,630
Fine.

339
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,410
Something was in the stable...

340
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,581
...tearing our horses to pieces.

341
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,475
l couldn't have saved my mother.

342
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,052
Or my sister.

343
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,117
Their screams woke me.

344
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:19,924
My father died outside,
trying to fend them off.

345
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,055
l stood at my door...

346
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,227
...about to run
to my nieces' room when....

347
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,474
Twin girls.

348
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,639
Barely 6 years old.

349
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,485
Butchered...

350
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,781
-...like animals.
-Jesus Christ.

351
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,948
The next thing l knew,
l was in his arms.

352
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,385
The war had spilled into our house.

353
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:56,498
He'd been tracking the Lycans
for days.

354
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,896
He drove them off and saved me.

355
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,730
-Who?
-Viktor.

356
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,908
The oldest and strongest of us.

357
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,470
That night,
he made me a Vampire.

358
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,948
He gave me the strength
to avenge my family.
